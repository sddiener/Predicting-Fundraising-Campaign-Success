<h3>Who I Am</h3>
<p>I am a poet, critic, and book designer living with my partner in Lancaster, PA. During the school year, I teach writing, one class per semester, at a nearby university -- this still qualifies me for Medicaid and other types of assistance, and I must collect unemployment every summer.</p>
<p>I am the author of two chapbooks of poems and one full-length collection, <em>Ordinary Beans </em>(Pecan Grove Press, 2007). My poems and reviews have appeared in three anthologies and over 60 periodicals; this fall, I will be presenting at the Celebrating African-American Literature conference at Penn State on the spoken-word poetry of Joel Dias-Porter, aka DJ Renegade. Someday I would like to start my own small press centering on poetry.</p>
<p>I am also disabled. I have severe fibromyalgia, quite possibly as a side effect of PTSD, although even the experts have a hard time saying for sure. I have degenerative disorder of the spine, which bends in the wrong places, and arthritis in both hips. A 13"" laptop is perfect for my crooked little hands, and allows me to recline, sit, or whatever position is most comfortable on a given day as I work. Or it used to.</p>
<h3><strong>What Happened</strong></h3>
<p>One day the ceiling fell in. The upstairs tenants overflowed their sink, their floor, my ceiling, and my bed, where the Macbook was sitting. Luckily the data was recoverable from the hard drive, including a novella in progress. The rest of the 13"" Macbook Pro, however, is hosed. No one can agree on whose insurance should pick up the cost. I don't have time for legal wrangling! I have poems and that conference paper to write, and video to edit for the conference presentation. And with the severe exhaustion caused by my combination of disabilities, as Sweet Brown so famously said, ain't nobody got time for that.</p>
<h3><strong>What I'm Asking For</strong></h3>
<p>The goal amount I have set is half of a new Macbook Pro of the model that would exactly replace mine, or perhaps an entire refurbished one. Any overfunding will go to the following areas first: 1. paying for the recovery of my data and putting it onto the new computer; 2. buying non-included software (such as Adobe Creative Suite or Final Cut Pro) or peripherals (they make a separate, wireless touchpad); 3. RAM upgrades or any other hardware adjustments needed to make my variety of creative projects run smoothly.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>You get the best thing I can think of to give anybody: poetry, written from me to you or perhaps a special person you know, on your choice of topic. Four very special backers will get some of the last few signed copies of my book in existence -- Pecan Grove Press has sadly, and quietly, been defunded by the university it was attached to upon the death of its founder, my great friend and mentor H. Palmer Hall. You also get boundless, humble gratitude and a special place in my heart.</p>

I believe it is what I am meant to do. Through an organization called Family Legacy, I have the opportunity to live my dream. In July 2014, I will travel to Zambia to attend Camp LIFE. This camp is seven days long and is patterned after a traditional church camp. However, Camp LIFE is created specifically for the orphaned child, a class of more than one million in Zambia. During this week, I will be matched up with a group of ten orphans and two english speaking Zambian ministry partners. Throughout the week, I as well as 1,000 other Zambian orphans will participate in teaching, worship, and song, all together. I will also be blessed to get to enjoy small group time with the ten kids assigned to me as well as having time set aside for one on one time with each child. This is where I will get to learn their own personal stories, their lives, their struggles, their dreams, and their feelings. This is where I will feel what God feels for each of their precious hearts. I will have the opportunity to tell them about God and hear their feelings about a higher power. In the past, this has been the time in which many of the orphans come to Christ, transforming their lives forever. On Thursday of this treasured week, we all journey together, each American with their group, into the compounds that the orphans call home. During this time, the children will share new found relationships with Christ to their surrounding neighbors. Sharing love, care, and the Gospel to the ten orphans I am assigned to will fulfill my heart but, more importantly, I hope it will give these precious souls hope for their future. Camp LIFE not only changes the lives of children who have been completely neglected, but will likely change my life forever. God is calling me to share my testimony to the most precious lives on Earth. I hope and pray that I will not only be changed by this experience, but touch the lives of those who need it most.<br/></p></span></div>","It has been a dream of mine for as long as I can remember to do mission work in Africa.

<p>As tensions continue to rise between the governments of Iran and the United States, the face of humanity is being lost. The complex reality of the situation is being replaced by simplistic propaganda.<br/><br/>This propaganda is attempting to generalize the entirety of the Iranian population under the stereotypes of oppressive tyrants, military fundamentalists, and xenophobic isolationists.

Yet the voices of the people are not heard above the cacophony of power struggles.<br/><br/>We need to hear the voices of the people, rather than the monologues of tyrants and politicians. Yet slowly, the people are being smothered. Slowly, their voices are being lost. Slowly, our eyes are being diverted. We are losing sight of reality, and falling into the fog of fiction. The voices of democracy in Iran are being repressed and neglected by the influences of power, hired media, and global politics - on both sides of the Atlantic. The vicious truths of geopolitics surrounding the Middle East are being covered up by a fictional vocabulary of spreading “stability” and “democracy”. <br/><br/>There is a need now to create a vehicle of discussion - a vehicle of anti-propaganda between the people of Iran and the people of the United States. There is a need now to amplify the voices of liberty and justice over the voices of tyranny and injustice.<br class=""kix-line-break""/><br class=""kix-line-break""/>""Confronting the Clash: The Suppressed Voices of Iran"" is a project aimed at achieving this end.</p>
<h2>The Project:</h2>
<p>There are two individuals compiling/authoring this book - myself (Sinan Ziza) and Sepa Sama. I am a Turkish American writer beginning my PhD studies in the United States. My colleague, Sepa is an Iranian American artist out of California. <br/><br/>I am on the East Coast. He is on the West Coast. Together, we have at our disposal a wide-reaching network - a network of writers, poets, artists, intellectuals, activists, professors, and journalists working in connection to the Middle East.<br/><br class=""kix-line-break""/>Over the past eight months, we have been using this network in order to gain insight into the raw, unbiased reality of the political and geopolitical context of Iran. We are now beginning to compile this into a book entitled ""Confronting the Clash: The Suppressed Voices of Iran"".</p>
<p>The goal of the book is threefold.</p>
<p>1 - To amplify the voices of the public of Iran speaking against war, injustice, and repression.<br/>2 - To unveil the voices of Iranians living within and outside of Iran that are (or at one time were) actively pursuing, rallying, or representing reformist and democratic causes.<br/>3 - To gather some of the world’s most noted political intellectuals in one book, as they talk about the geopolitical reality surrounding the situation of Iran and the Middle East. <br/><br/>This is not a history book.

Help us spread the truth. Help us confront the clash.  </p>
<h2>The Details:</h2>
<p>The book is going to be finished in June 2012, and published in July 2012. A few publishers have approached us on the subject, but we want to keep the book as accessible and affordable as possible. This is easiest to achieve through independent publication. </p>
<p>We are asking for your help to make this possible.</p>
<p>We consider this project to be an important one. We have done a great deal of the leg work on our own funds. We do not, however, have enough to cover the costs involved with publication. At a minimum, we need $3,000 in order to achieve this. That being said, the more we can raise beyond $3,000, the more we can print, and the more we can subsidize the final price of the book. <br/><br/>Thank you for your support, and for your time.</p>
<h2>About the Title:</h2>
<p>The title, ""Confronting the Clash"" has three meanings.</p>
<p>1) Confronting Samuel Huntington's theory of the Clash of Civilizations.</p>
<p>2) Confronting the volatile talk of war and ""military action"" between the United States and Iran today.</p>
<p>3) In Sepa's childhood drawing, he depicted a mythological figure (Simurgh) rising in order to confront the clash of the Iran-Iraq war. </p>

<p> </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Language and word choice is powerful. In our abbreviated text-messaging world, our use of language is more important than ever. By re-languaging our conversations to promote dialogue that is both kinder and more inclusive, our familial and personal relationships will improve, opening doors to greater collaboration and partnership. This re-languaging will be achieved through the creation of new words and phrases that will foster kindness and cooperation.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>I was elated to receive a graduate scholar award to attend </span><strong>ARTS IN SOCIETY 2013</strong><span> and serve as a chairperson throughout the conference. This award only pays for conference fees, not travel, room or board.</span></p>

<h3 dir=""ltr""><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What your contribution will do:</span></h3>
<p><strong>It will enable a student/teacher/parent/author and social activist to bring global solutions to community issues with the potential of long term possitive impact in many different arenas.</strong></p>
I am equally excited about learning more about the different cultures represented.  It is my hope that I will be able to extend my stay and visit several institutions that my expand my knowledge base and open the door to more global solutions to our ever troubled prison system and the pitfalls caused by incarceration. Admittedly, my viewpoint is limited, and I would like to take this racially and economically motivated issue that plagues the US to a greater audience.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong><span style=""font-size: 12px;"">In otherwords, I want to also visit prisons and hospitals to observe how others have used re-llanguaging (or biblio-therapy) to increase both mental and physical health, and restoration of a quality life.</span></strong>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">The Impact</span></strong></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"">This re-languaged way of speaking will positively influence outcomes in several different ways including</h3>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<h3 dir=""ltr"">promote better emotional and physical health</h3>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<h3 dir=""ltr"">allow individuals to re-evaluate past events</h3>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<h3 dir=""ltr"">draw more hopeful conclusions about their futures.</h3>

</ul>
This re-languaging may also cause society to revisit certitudes that are based on old stories that were languaged poorly or now no longer serve.</div>
<div>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">You see, my basic issue with how we treat ex- offenders in the US is that they never finish paying for their crimes in the same way most chronically ill patients never fully recover from their illnesses.  </span></p>

<p dir=""ltr""> I have always been interested in the personal pathology of individuals. As an author of both fiction and non-fiction work, that curiosity has extended to the characters I create and the ones that have been a part of my life since childhood. What makes us who we are?

                 Re-Languaging for Social Change:
      Re-stor(y)ing our Lives by Rewording our World
 
Language and word choice is powerful. In our abbreviated text-messaging world, our use of language is more important than ever. By re-languaging our conversations to promote dialogue that is both kinder and more inclusive, our familial and personal relationships will improve, opening doors to greater collaboration and partnership. This re-languaging will be achieved through the creation of new words and phrases that will foster kindness and cooperation.
I was elated to receive a graduate scholar award to attend ARTS IN SOCIETY 2013 and serve as a chairperson throughout the conference. This award only pays for conference fees, not travel, room or board.
What your contribution will buy:
Roundtrip ticket to Hungary          1,700
Room and board                             600
Misc expences                               200
___________________________________
                          Total               $2,500
What your contribution will do:
It will enable a student/teacher/parent/author and social activist to bring global solutions to community issues with the potential of long term possitive impact in many different arenas.
I am equally excited about learning more about the different cultures represented.  It is my hope that I will be able to extend my stay and visit several institutions that my expand my knowledge base and open the door to more global solutions to our ever troubled prison system and the pitfalls caused by incarceration. Admittedly, my viewpoint is limited, and I would like to take this racially and economically motivated issue that plagues the US to a greater audience.
 

In otherwords, I want to also visit prisons and hospitals to observe how others have used re-llanguaging (or biblio-therapy) to increase both mental and physical health, and restoration of a quality life.
The Impact
This re-languaged way of speaking will positively influence outcomes in several different ways including


promote better emotional and physical health


allow individuals to re-evaluate past events


draw more hopeful conclusions about their futures.


This re-languaging may also cause society to revisit certitudes that are based on old stories that were languaged poorly or now no longer serve.

You see, my basic issue with how we treat ex- offenders in the US is that they never finish paying for their crimes in the same way most chronically ill patients never fully recover from their illnesses.  
I have documented where in cases people have learned to re-language these life-altering events, their futures have been impacted emmensely.

<p><strong>Story of My Book</strong></p>
<p>Through a travel-based fictional narrative of a recent college graduate, <i>Romance of the Climate Crisis</i> documents stories of real people who witnessed the worst impacts of climate change in their everyday lives. Using such narratives from different parts of the world, this book is my effort in depicting what climate change looks like in real life, beyond the world of numbers and graphs. The protagonist, throughout this book, travels to different parts of the world, vicariously experiences climate catastrophes, and searches for meaning in life by looking at solutions and careers that can potentially contribute to fighting climate change.</p>
<p>My name is Shreyansh Budhia, and I am the author of <i>Romance of the Climate Crisis</i>. I wrote this book because I felt that the global climate narrative needed more personalized stories of people on the frontlines to be told. This narrative, I felt, was essentially what people needed to hear, besides the climate science and data that continues to hint at the urgency of climate change.</p>
<p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that climate change is as much about people as it is about numbers and that it is already severing people’s lives in the worst ways possible. With this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for nature, people, and the search for different ways young people can do their part in fighting the problem. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you understand the severity of this problem, develop compassion towards the communities impacted, and know that there are professional ways for you to build a career that fights the climate crisis in some way or another.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about people from different parts of the world and the different ways their lives are impacted by climate change:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>A wildfire in California incinerates several residents of a town, burns their homes, and melts a bus.</li>
<li>Floods in South Carolina make residents consider permanently abandoning parts of Charleston.</li>
<li>An airline pilot observes Alaska’s Columbia glacier receding 15 miles inland within two decades.</li>
<li>An entire village in Fiji decides to relocate and save its residents from rising sea level.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you love people and you care for others. <i>Romance of the Climate Crisis</i> is a fictional work that speaks to environmentalists and young people who are looking to vicariously experience climate change, explore careers that deal with climate solutions, and find meaning in life.</p>

<p>The book is written in 4 Parts....</p>
<ul>
<li>Part 1 contains the introduction plus Chapters 1-5. This sections sets the protagonist’s resolve to travel the world and find something purposeful to work on. The protagonist travels to different states within the US and sees the impact of climate change on the communities and wildlife in those states. The reader might learn that climate change isn’t alien to America. In fact, some of the worst climate-impacted communities call America home.</li>
<li>Part 2 contains Chapters 5-13. The protagonist flies abroad and discovers climate survival stories from other parts of the world. He travels through some of the prettiest landscapes of the world and learns about the local inhabitants' struggle with the climate crisis.</li>
<li>Part 3 contains Chapters 13-17. The protagonist learns about governments and nonprofits in different countries that have been working on mitigating the climate crisis. He thinks about corporate social responsibility and sees how some corporations are trying to become sustainable in the face of an ever-increasing consumer demand for environmentally friendly goods and services</li>
<li>Part 4 contains Chapters 18-21. The protagonist considers different strategies to fight climate change. He thinks about the different ways young people like him can contribute to climate solutions, not only by being independent citizens, but by also building climate-conscious careers. He ponders over chances of completely restoring the climate and questions whether such ambitious goals are possible. He muses about his drive to find purpose in life and vets if the environment can give him that purpose.</li>

I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up to date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.

It will give you unique ways to help you mourn with joy, so you can heal, grow and transform your life.<br/><br/>My name is Jen Hale and I am the author of <i>Have a Good Mourning</i>. My life forever changed on April 25, 2018 at 1:47am. That's when I had to say goodbye to one of the most important people in my life – my dear, sweet mother, Sue. I wrote this book because I want to do nothing but honor my mother and the impact she’s had on my life every single day, but do it in a happy, transformative way – a way where I can do good for the world around me while helping myself heal the massive void she left behind. But, most of all, do it with joy.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will begin to see a new life opening up for you as you read inspiring stories of people already on their own good mourning journeys. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of dedication that I have for having a good mourning in you. And, then, ultimately, I want you to view this book as a powerful resource equipped with a set of soul-enriching practices that will give you the rare opportunity to change the way you mourn, so, you, too can transform your life.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about how joyful mourning can lead to hope, change, and most of all, transformation:</p><ul>
<li>How Anthony Samadani, along with Muhammad Ali’s oldest daughter, May May, have partnered together to launch the <i>Good News Network</i> in an effort to spread joy instead of fear in the mainstream media…</li>
<li>How Kinja Dixon, a self-made millionaire and best-selling author of <i>Recreationism</i>, feels even more connected to his late mother now than while she was alive…</li>
<li>How Jennifer Morilla uprooted her cushy life as a marketer in New York City to give the gift of water – and a renewed sense of hope – to underdeveloped communities all over the world…</li>
</ul><p>You will love this book if you are looking for something different when it comes to mourning, in particular a new, fresh perspective that evokes joy and infuses hope in your life. <i>Have a Good Mourning</i> is a non-fiction book that will speak to anyone who wants to discover how mourning with joy can change their lives forever.</p><h2>
<br/>The Book – Have a Good Mourning</h2><p>The book is written in three parts in an effort to show you how long we've let outdated cultural norms dictate how we mourn. Next, you'll quickly see how easy it is to leave these boring, depressing rituals behind as you experience your own ""good mourning"" shift. Finally, you'll feel empowered to start applying the fun, unique good mourning practices inside this book to your own life.  <br/><br/>Part 1, <strong>Understanding How We Mourn</strong>, contains the Introduction, plus three additional chapters. Part 1 will give you a taste of what we’ve been given, from the ""experts,"" when it comes to grief and mourning. You’ll quickly learn there is so much more to healing after a loss than simply observing Elisabeth Kubler Ross’ 5 stages of grief or reading Sigmund Freud’s theories.<br/><br/>Part 2, <strong>Principles of Joyful Mourning</strong>, includes Chapters 4-6. In Part 2, you will discover something incredibly powerful – something you may not even know you had – that will give you the strength to use your loss as a springboard into your new, transformed life. It’s called the Good Mourning shift. It lays dormant inside your soul until you need it, of course. Once you find it, your life will never be the same again.<br/><br/>Part 3, <strong>How You Mourn With Joy</strong>, contains Chapters 7-23 and a conclusion. In Part 3, you’ll meet some pretty incredible people like Jennifer Morilla, Kinja Dixon, Dan Benjamin, Natalie Sanchez, and Gigi Trencher, who have all been impacted by a heartbreaking loss. They will inspire you to leave your old, sad grief-stricken life behind in search for your new, joyful destiny as you heal, grow and transform your life from the inside out.</p><h2>

He always enjoys chatting with his friends, playing board games, and partaking in local trivia nights.For more information, you can connect with Andy Penk at andypenkmusic@gmail.com and at @andypenkmusic on Facebook and Instagram. International PreordersFor international preorders, please send me a private message. Risks & ChallengesThe biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into each pre-order tier. The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we ship the pre-order rewards to you as early as possible. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as to when my book will publish. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship. Other Ways You Can HelpSome people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:Please share my pre-sale campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family and network. Please use #TheMusicHustle and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press, so that we can help amplify your efforts.
You can easily share my pre-sale campaign via Indiegogo at the top of the page.
Please share my book with 5 friends, family members, or co-workers who you think would enjoy it via text or direct message on social media.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>My Story</strong></p>
<p>As a 12x children's author and former civic leader in Lower Merion, I have focused on bringing people together, doing whatever I can to foster connections between others and empower them to understand each other. This is almost never easy work, but the more that I do it and the more I commit myself to it, the more that it seems to repay me. It is always fulfilling to see that I have made a difference in a person’s life, especially a young person.</p>
<p>Toward that end, I have spent some time and energy on restarting a project that I first jotted down notes for a few years ago. Watching everything that has gone on recently, I feel that the time for this is right: I am writing a children’s book that will examine and discuss police and community relations, covering a tough topic in a way that is lighthearted, fun, and clear. I want this book to become a go-to resource for organizations and police departments striving to work toward positive change.</p>
<p>Featuring one of my characters, Aron &amp; The Police Give Back to the Community will draw heavily on the real-world work that I have done to bridge gaps between cops and the community, all while embracing the spirit of giving that I celebrate through my story time, book drive, and food drive initiatives.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>My goal today is to raise $10,000 to cover the costs associated with publishing the book and begin bringing it to bookshelves and Police Departments all across the country. These funds will pay for illustrations (in conjunction with a freelance artist), book formatting, ISBN number registration, proof printing, and curriculum production. Our hope is to also print a pilot run of 1000 books to be distributed to police departments associated with the Race for Peace Organization, a Committee that comprises members of law enforcement, clergy, government and citizens from Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery and Philadelphia counties who are actively working together to strengthen the relationship between law enforcement and the communities they serve.</p>
<p>Make your contribution and help bring this positive, fun book to life now!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Storytelling for Change</strong></p>
<p>As thrilled as I am to tell my story to young people nationwide, I am even more excited to change hearts and minds via the message that I have written into this children’s book. As we have all experienced firsthand, stories can change our views of the world, setting us out on new paths and enabling us to understand others more fully and clearly. That is what this book is about: change for the better.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>In addition to making a monetary contribution to this campaign, you can show your support for me and my children’s book by sharing a link to the campaign on any social media platforms you use. Now more than ever, we all need to speak up for the sort of connections we want to see between cops and the community, thinking creatively to express ourselves and effect sustained progress.</p>

This all started as a war between game developers and crackers : while game companies were adding copy protections, crackers would inevitably try and defeat these protections. Crackers would sign their feats and add the name of their group, their slogan or a text at the start of the game. At the beginning, it was only about small animations with jingles in the background, intros then became bigger and more complex, thus came the first demos into life.</p><p> </p><p><i>La genèse des démos et de la scène demo a commencé avec Apple à la fin des années 70 et a réellement pris son apogée avec le Commodore 64, l'Amstrad, l'Amiga ou encore l'Atari ST.

Les pirates signaient leurs méfaits en ajoutant le nom de leur groupe, leur slogan ou un texte au démarrage du jeu.

 Demos and the demoscene started with the advent of the Apple computer at the end of the 70's and really reached its peak with the Commodore 64, the Amstrad, the Amiga or the Atari ST. This all started as a war between game developers and crackers : while game companies were adding copy protections, crackers would inevitably try and defeat these protections. Crackers would sign their feats and add the name of their group, their slogan or a text at the start of the game. At the beginning, it was only about small animations with jingles in the background, intros then became bigger and more complex, thus came the first demos into life. La genèse des démos et de la scène demo a commencé avec Apple à la fin des années 70 et a réellement pris son apogée avec le Commodore 64, l'Amstrad, l'Amiga ou encore l'Atari ST. L’histoire commence avec une bataille entre les développeurs de jeux vidéos et les pirates informatiques, les uns protégeant leurs créations, les autres s’acharnant à enlever ces protections. Les pirates signaient leurs méfaits en ajoutant le nom de leur groupe, leur slogan ou un texte au démarrage du jeu. Il s’agissait au début de petites animations avec une musique en arrière-plan jusqu’à ce que les intros deviennent de plus en plus volumineuses et plus complexes, Ainsi sont nées les premières démos.Discover the technical,  graphical and musical evolution of the Amiga demos throughout the years, in Volume 1 (covering the period 1984-1993) with the most mythical ones of groups such as Kefrens, Silents or Sanity. Découvrez l'évolution technique mais aussi graphique et musicale des démos Amiga à travers les années volume 1 (1984 1993).

</div>
<p>Love. It’s a
mystery. It’s a catch-22 dressed as a
sixty-four-thousand-dollar question. Cracking its enigmatic code is one of the
toughest challenges in the world and clearly an endeavor only a top tier
strategy consultant could even consider undertaking. <i>Bazinga . . . </i></p>
<p>Management
consultants are as incapable as the rest of us to truly understand love – although for the right price, they might argue the opposite.
Besides, love is probably not one of the most complex issues in the world.
Nevertheless, <b>I believe we would be better off if we understood our behavior
in relationships better than we do today –<i>
much better</i></b>. That is the fundamental mission of this book.</p><p>Most relationships end. In fact, we're all entitled to precisely <i>one </i>happily-ever-after (best case scenario). All the other love stories will dissolve. This is as true as Nutella and taxes. However, we can learn an awful lot of ending relationships and breakups. Those insights have the power to put us in a much better position next time love comes around!</p><p></p><h2>Who am I to write it?</h2><p>Who am I and why should you consider funding and/or reading this book while Netflix has many years’
worth of great series to watch? I’m not a middle-aged woman with a decades-long
career in relationship counselling. I’m not Dr. Phil or a <i>been-around-the-block</i> pickup artist. In short, I’m not an expert.
I’m just a thirty-something guy with a deep interest in social dynamics and a
tendency to escalate commitments. I started researching the subject over two
years ago. </p><p>Upon graduation from my MBA, I took a job in a top-tier management consulting
firm – one of those corporate brands that earn you a lot of brownie points on
LinkedIn. This turned out to be not entirely fit for the purpose of deepening my
understanding of love. <i>No sh#t, Sherlock!</i>
However, under the cobwebs of analysis-paralysis, I discovered a useful tool
seasoned consultants apply when facing challenges: systematically break down
bigger problems into bite size pieces. Now that’s something that resonates with
me. That's the approach I've adopted in my quest to understand love. </p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">In the
process, I’ve picked the brains of academic experts in social and evolutionary
psychology, communication &amp; conflict sciences, emotional intelligence, and more. With a
fine-tooth comb, I’ve gone through the work of escort girls, divorce lawyers,
second-grade self-help gurus and first-grade self-improvement scholars. Gradually, I started to connect some
dots. And although I cannot tell you what to do, I do have to share with you what
I know.</span><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 38px; background-color: initial;"">What to

Brain design, temperament, character, values and needs are all important components in our relationship behavior. The following chapter [<b>LIKE</b>], addresses interpersonal dynamics, like sex, attraction and limerence, in detail. These processes are often the foreplay of [<b>LOVE</b>], which is the third chapter. We identify key attributes that are required for loving relationships. Ever thought about intimacy, commitment and trust <span style=""background-color: initial;"">in a business-like way?  Now is the time. In chapter 4 [</span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">SUSTAIN</b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">], we describe which elements make love last.  This is a consultant's take on great communication, conflict management, individuality, fun, and a bunch of other tricks of the trade.</span>
</div><div> </div><div>Starting from chapter 5 [<b>DOUBT</b>], the relationship begins going downhill. Maybe surprisingly, there is more structure to the mayhem than we'd expect. In an interesting dynamic of action and reaction, the once loving partners alienate each other at increasing speed, until a tipping point is reached... In chapter 6 [<b>SPLIT</b>], we kick the tires of the actual breakup and its consequences. I also outline ""Project Breakup 2.0"", which contains a boatload of suggestions to avoid screwing up while breaking up. W<i>e all suck at breaking up, and for valid reasons!</i> In the last chapter [<b>COPE</b>], I address the booby traps and sensations of the newly-single experience, and also debunk some myths around singleness. We'll finish by highlighting the mistakes to avoid in the next relationship if we want to have a shot at our happily-ever-after!</div><div><br/></div><div>

</div>
<div>
<b>1. </b>First of all - me. Or better, <b>my perspective</b>. E<i>love</i>ator Pitches <span style=""background-color: initial;"">is written by a 30-something male foot soldier of
love, not by an authoritative general observing the trenches from a
distance (e.g. a retired relationship counselor looking to monetize her experience). This makes the book more accessible and relevant for younger targets, <b>both women and men</b>. For <u>men</u>, this is maybe the first book in its genre that takes a rain check on the trademark sticky toffee pudding tone associated with traditional relationship and/or self-improvement literature. Opting out? Know that love has more nuances than cricket and chess combined! For <u>women</u>, the views of a male author on love can provide some refreshing perspectives on relationships. Maybe I'm wrong, but there is only one way to find out...</span>

<p><b>2.</b> E<i>love</i>ator Pitches is a <b>short book</b>. I made it deliberately
compact because your time is precious and I respect that. At the start of each section, the <b>read time in minutes is announced</b>. You can chop up your reading, and you'll always know what to expect. T<span style=""background-color: initial;"">he absolute fastest way through this book is to skip
straight to the <b>60 second elevator pitches</b> you'll find at the end of each
chapter. E<i>love</i>ator Pitches is jam-packed with insights the way a Snickers bar is packed with calories. All 200+ pages (~65 000 words) count - sort of. </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">  </span></p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>3.</b> E<i>love</i>ator Pitches is <b>hand-illustrated </b>with more than<b> two dozen of graphs and charts</b> that, in another life, could have been used for real management consulting presentations.

<br/><p><b>4.</b>  This must be the first book ever written that comes with an <b>entire 8+ hour Spotify sound track </b>custom-made for each of the (sub-) chapters. The aim is
two-fold. Firstly, this music can set an <u>appropriate mood</u> for reading a particular section. Secondly, most billboard charts and movie theatres are swamped
with lyrics and stories that are as truthful or realistic as the average
mascara commercial. Nonetheless, they impact our belief system around love and
relationships in ways more important than we'd like to admit. While reading, you can compare the information in the book with what you hear in the songs, and <u>spot the inconsistencies</u>. Bottom line, this play list is entirely optional, but
pledges to provide a more immersive experience.

<h2>What will the funds be used for?</h2>
<p>The first objective - after two years of intense work - is to share my views with the broadest possible audience. This requires a <b>finished product</b> and a limited <b>marketing budget</b>. E<i>love</i>ator Pitches went through a first round of professional editing prior to this campaign, financed by my savings, and recovering some of that investment through pre-sales would be welcome. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1305295/files/20150318082000-Rockets_final.jpg?1426692000"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Furthermore, I will need to fund the design of a professional book cover, final editing and the print of the first batch. I'll also need an author's website. These first objectives require about <b>$9000</b>.</p>
<p>When the campaign reaches <b>$12500</b>, I can work towards a hardcover version, with colored graphics. If we reach <b>$15000</b> together, I'll do the necessary to have E<i>love</i>ator Pitches made available in audiobook format.</p>
<p>And I promise, if the campaign reaches<b> $20000+</b>, I will organize a book launch party in June (In London) where all the donors get VIP treatment. I'll add additional stretch goals to share the love if our efforts really make the dollars go through the roof... Stay tuned!</p>
<p>Keep in mind that all pledges are subject to Indiegogo and/or Paypal <b>fees </b>which amount to about 10-12% of the total funds. I'm also covering the <b>production and shipping costs</b> of the perks you'll discover if you keep reading.</p>

<p>Well, this is the moment when I turn the mic to you... As you'll see in the perks, the contributions that I'm shooting for are <b>pre-sales</b>  and value-added services, rather than charitable donations (although I'm not in the position to turn those down either!). The perks cover a wide range of rewards, and I'm sure everybody who partakes in the action will find something of value in the options. Here's a brief overview - you can find more information of the 20 (!) different perks in the dedicated section to the right of this page.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1303473/files/20150317150943-Reward_structure.JPG?1426630183"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/></p>

Why this
book? 

Love. It’s a
mystery. It’s a catch-22 dressed as a
sixty-four-thousand-dollar question. Cracking its enigmatic code is one of the
toughest challenges in the world and clearly an endeavor only a top tier
strategy consultant could even consider undertaking. Bazinga . . . 
Management
consultants are as incapable as the rest of us to truly understand love – although for the right price, they might argue the opposite.
Besides, love is probably not one of the most complex issues in the world.
Nevertheless, I believe we would be better off if we understood our behavior
in relationships better than we do today –
much better. That is the fundamental mission of this book.Most relationships end. In fact, we're all entitled to precisely one happily-ever-after (best case scenario). All the other love stories will dissolve. This is as true as Nutella and taxes. However, we can learn an awful lot of ending relationships and breakups. Those insights have the power to put us in a much better position next time love comes around!Who am I to write it?Who am I and why should you consider funding and/or reading this book while Netflix has many years’
worth of great series to watch? I’m not a middle-aged woman with a decades-long
career in relationship counselling. I’m not Dr. Phil or a been-around-the-block pickup artist. In short, I’m not an expert.
I’m just a thirty-something guy with a deep interest in social dynamics and a
tendency to escalate commitments. I started researching the subject over two
years ago. Upon graduation from my MBA, I took a job in a top-tier management consulting
firm – one of those corporate brands that earn you a lot of brownie points on
LinkedIn. This turned out to be not entirely fit for the purpose of deepening my
understanding of love. No sh#t, Sherlock!
However, under the cobwebs of analysis-paralysis, I discovered a useful tool
seasoned consultants apply when facing challenges: systematically break down
bigger problems into bite size pieces. Now that’s something that resonates with
me. That's the approach I've adopted in my quest to understand love. In the
process, I’ve picked the brains of academic experts in social and evolutionary
psychology, communication & conflict sciences, emotional intelligence, and more. With a
fine-tooth comb, I’ve gone through the work of escort girls, divorce lawyers,
second-grade self-help gurus and first-grade self-improvement scholars. Gradually, I started to connect some
dots. And although I cannot tell you what to do, I do have to share with you what
I know.What to
expect of Eloveator Pitches?Eloveator Pitches consists of two parts and seven chapters. Together, we cover all the different steps of a relationship, from before the first glance to beyond the last goodbye.If you want to learn more, please discover what to expect from this book by clicking here (this link will take you to a Dropbox PDF with a four-page description of the content). The extended table of content can be found here.  Otherwise, here's is the 60 second elevator pitch of Eloveator Pitches. Chapter 1 [BE] tackles the individual characteristics that are relevant for our love life. Brain design, temperament, character, values and needs are all important components in our relationship behavior. The following chapter [LIKE], addresses interpersonal dynamics, like sex, attraction and limerence, in detail. These processes are often the foreplay of [LOVE], which is the third chapter. We identify key attributes that are required for loving relationships. Ever thought about intimacy, commitment and trust in a business-like way?  Now is the time. In chapter 4 [SUSTAIN], we describe which elements make love last.  This is a consultant's take on great communication, conflict management, individuality, fun, and a bunch of other tricks of the trade.
 Starting from chapter 5 [DOUBT], the relationship begins going downhill. Maybe surprisingly, there is more structure to the mayhem than we'd expect. In an interesting dynamic of action and reaction, the once loving partners alienate each other at increasing speed, until a tipping point is reached... In chapter 6 [SPLIT], we kick the tires of the actual breakup and its consequences. I also outline ""Project Breakup 2.0"", which contains a boatload of suggestions to avoid screwing up while breaking up. We all suck at breaking up, and for valid reasons! In the last chapter [COPE], I address the booby traps and sensations of the newly-single experience, and also debunk some myths around singleness. We'll finish by highlighting the mistakes to avoid in the next relationship if we want to have a shot at our happily-ever-after!

What's so special about this book?


1. First of all - me. Or better, my perspective. Eloveator Pitches is written by a 30-something male foot soldier of
love, not by an authoritative general observing the trenches from a
distance (e.g. a retired relationship counselor looking to monetize her experience). This makes the book more accessible and relevant for younger targets, both women and men. For men, this is maybe the first book in its genre that takes a rain check on the trademark sticky toffee pudding tone associated with traditional relationship and/or self-improvement literature. Opting out? Know that love has more nuances than cricket and chess combined! For women, the views of a male author on love can provide some refreshing perspectives on relationships. Maybe I'm wrong, but there is only one way to find out...



2. Eloveator Pitches is a short book. I made it deliberately
compact because your time is precious and I respect that. At the start of each section, the read time in minutes is announced. You can chop up your reading, and you'll always know what to expect. The absolute fastest way through this book is to skip
straight to the 60 second elevator pitches you'll find at the end of each
chapter. Eloveator Pitches is jam-packed with insights the way a Snickers bar is packed with calories. All 200+ pages (~65 000 words) count - sort of.   

3. Eloveator Pitches is hand-illustrated with more than two dozen of graphs and charts that, in another life, could have been used for real management consulting presentations. Besides clarifying key concepts, it also gives a quick look into what management consultants keep themselves busy with. Here are some actual examples from the book.





4.  This must be the first book ever written that comes with an entire 8+ hour Spotify sound track custom-made for each of the (sub-) chapters. The aim is
two-fold. Firstly, this music can set an appropriate mood for reading a particular section. Secondly, most billboard charts and movie theatres are swamped
with lyrics and stories that are as truthful or realistic as the average
mascara commercial. Nonetheless, they impact our belief system around love and
relationships in ways more important than we'd like to admit. While reading, you can compare the information in the book with what you hear in the songs, and spot the inconsistencies. Bottom line, this play list is entirely optional, but
pledges to provide a more immersive experience. Because you've given me already some of your time, you can find it here, entirely for free. It matches the detailed table of contents seamlessly.
5. The approach. We're not here for a quick buck. We're in it for the long run. We've gone to great lengths to make this book as grand as it could be. We've put equal care in the support campaign. Take a break from the reading and check out our latest support video that has gone viral online (3k views in 24 hours). And it's only 2 minutes long.

What will the funds be used for?
The first objective - after two years of intense work - is to share my views with the broadest possible audience. This requires a finished product and a limited marketing budget. Eloveator Pitches went through a first round of professional editing prior to this campaign, financed by my savings, and recovering some of that investment through pre-sales would be welcome. 


Furthermore, I will need to fund the design of a professional book cover, final editing and the print of the first batch. I'll also need an author's website. These first objectives require about $9000.
When the campaign reaches $12500, I can work towards a hardcover version, with colored graphics. If we reach $15000 together, I'll do the necessary to have Eloveator Pitches made available in audiobook format.
And I promise, if the campaign reaches $20000+, I will organize a book launch party in June (In London) where all the donors get VIP treatment. I'll add additional stretch goals to share the love if our efforts really make the dollars go through the roof... Stay tuned!
Keep in mind that all pledges are subject to Indiegogo and/or Paypal fees which amount to about 10-12% of the total funds. I'm also covering the production and shipping costs of the perks you'll discover if you keep reading.
So what? Now what?
Well, this is the moment when I turn the mic to you... As you'll see in the perks, the contributions that I'm shooting for are pre-sales  and value-added services, rather than charitable donations (although I'm not in the position to turn those down either!). The perks cover a wide range of rewards, and I'm sure everybody who partakes in the action will find something of value in the options. Here's a brief overview - you can find more information of the 20 (!) different perks in the dedicated section to the right of this page.
I hope that I've tickled your interest and that you will - like my editor - occasionally laugh out loud with the many metaphors that color these otherwise relatively serious topics. Disappointed? Unlikely but...there's a money back guarantee*. If you've got any questions, drop me an email (woutermm@gmail.com). 
*Only the face value of the eBook or equivalent
P.S. The CCTV footage was truthful. I did quit my job as a management consultant, in part to focus on writing. I'll explain it to you later, Mom ;).
If you can't contribute, I would be very grateful if you could share this campaign, join the Facebook page or follow Eloveator on Twitter. By doing this, I can keep you in the loop about this book, and our next project (yes, something's cooking already!).

 as masters at getting things done. By normal standards, some of our

 more with less. </p>

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The Secret of the Special Forces</span><br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>In the Special Forces, <b>Get Er Done </b>was simply a way of life. One 
of Special Forces’ mottos is “improvise, adapt, overcome.” The concept 
is that we would take the situation as it was. There wasn’t time or 
energy to waste on bemoaning what it should be. We would then take the 
skills we had, learn very quickly, or could purchase and get er done. 
The end result was most often success. The process might not follow the 
original plan. Because we approached things with the mindset of success 
we stacked the deck and found the resources to make it happen.</p>
<p>In reality, us in the super achieving, get er done Special Forces have 
the same amount of time in their days as anyone. Our secret is that we
 <strong>learned techniques to make ourselves highly effective</strong>.
 I shared ten of the best techniques that people could use to 
get them started getting things done quickly and effectively. I made it 
an easy, quick read knowing that the last thing everyone needs is to be faced 
with a fifty page chapter on the benefits of goal setting, or a whole 
book on making to-do lists. </p>
<p>What people need are techniques that they can 
use quickly and get instant results from. The answers were out there, 
but more often they took a lot of sweat and pain to learn them the hard 
way. Over the years in my training I came across techniques that worked 
for me and others and kept them in my “mental toolbox.” I am making it 
super easy for people and giving them the tools to <strong>Get Er Done.</strong></p>
<p><em>Get Er Done – The Green Beret Guide to Productivity </em>gives principles from which everyone will get amazing results and find that they are 
performing at levels never thought possible. It is a <strong>simple, easy-to-read system</strong> that gives a <strong>workable, proven list </strong>of things to put in action, right now and have <strong>positive results </strong>in
 getting things done. Some will fit an individual personality, some won’t. It is 
for each person to pick from and apply them immediately. </p>
<p>There is no heavy 
reading and no long dialogue to struggle through. Just useful 
information that to use instantly to take total control of your 
life. You’ll see results from day one, and by the end of a month you 
will wonder why getting things done ever seemed to be a problem.</p>

<p></p>
<p>I have had many, many emails telling me about the great results they have gotten after putting in place the techniques from the book.</p>
<p>Here is a testimonial from a reader:</p>
<p><i>We all have busy lives; work, kids, families – and it seem these days that nothing ever gets any easier or slower.  Last weekend for me was no exception.</i></p>
<p><i>A childhood friend was getting married, and had invited us to her wedding.  We wanted to go, but the time restraints, and the costs to move a family of 4 back and forth in one weekend was beginning to mount up, so it was decided I would travel alone for this trip.</i></p>
<p><i>The trick was, this had to be fast, and accurate, and the wedding was in New York, and we live in North Carolina.  The entire trip was going to take place in 28 hours!  I had one day of leave, and had to be back on duty Monday morning at 0800. </i></p>
<p><i>I would fly into NYC Saturday morning, get my rental car, and drive to the Poughkeepsie area (90 miles away) where I grew up.</i></p>
<p><i>I would go see a few old sites specific to my childhood, (high school, the track I used to train on, the old house I grew up in, the farm where my first job was, the old firehouse where I got my start in Firefighting, etc...)  Then head to the church for the wedding, then to the reception site that was 50 miles away, after the reception, go to my hotel and then spend the night, then fly home out of NYC in the morning.</i></p>
<p><i>On top of that, I really wanted to get to the WTC and see the Freedom Tower and memorial.  I only had Sunday before I went home to do this, and I really wanted to since it had been completed after my last visit to NYC in 2008.<br/><br/>This trip needed to be planned out to the hour.  I had to allow for traffic, food, gas, tolls, and the incidentals that would or could fall in line.  I knew that if I didn’t plan this out, something would be missed – and I definitely couldn’t miss my flight back home!</i></p>
<p><i>I remembered reading in Mike Martel’s Book Get Er Done the format for Backward Planning.  I decided if there was every anytime that could benefit from using this method, this would be the weekend to do it!</i></p>
<p><i>So dressed in a suit, carrying my one lone bag – a GR1 backpack from GORUCK, I arrived at the airport in Raleigh NC for my 0630hr flight on Saturday morning, and headed north.  From that moment, to the moment I was wheels up on Sunday to come home, I was able to hit every single time hack, and still have time to spare on the end before I scheduled myself to fly home!</i></p>
<p><i>Walking out to the car on Sunday morning after my flight home, I replayed how fast the previous 28 hours had been.  I had accomplished so much, gotten to see and experience all that I wanted to, and was not rushed in the least due to the use of Backward Planning.  Thanks Mike!!</i></p>

<p><b>Here's a couple more:</b></p>
<div><i>“What a great read! Mike does a great job of taking his years of 
Green Beret training and military skills into real life practical how 
to’s for succeeding in life. He translates the highly effective and 
intense training of the US military Green Berets and applies it to every
 day civilian steps and systems to help people achieve their dreams.”

<p><i>Hello, I don't often review books although I read many of them. This 
book was great because their was no fluff. It took 30 to 45 minutes to 
read, and everything was applicable to life, especially if you use a 
little creativity. I have read mostly psychology books and everything in
 here fit right in with what I know about psychology and 
neuroplasticity, but there was no explanation as to why it works in the 
book. I guess there is no need to explain why it works if it works, 
especially in an organization such as the military, where efficiency is 
key, and there is no room for theory. Great value, especially the kindle
 edition. I thought the title was cheesy, ""get er done"", but I was 
pleasantly surprised, the book gets er done...quickly. </i></p>

Not your normal self help book or author 
I help people get better. 
You might be an entrepreneur 
growing your business.  You might want to get in shape. You might just 
want to manage your time better. 
My ability to do all this 
comes from my experiences in the military and specifically the US Army 
Special Forces  Green Berets.  The Special Forces Green Berets are known
 as masters at getting things done. By normal standards, some of our 
missions would be deemed impossible. Often times we were expected to 
operate far behind enemy lines with limited resources. Our  training 
gave us principles and techniques in being extremely effective and doing
 more with less. 
Throughout the years I developed a 
philosophy and methodology that you can use to create amazing results.  
You have to set your mind to it and work hard, but almost anything is 
possible if you follow the steps I teach.

  Here's your chance to get copies of my best work to help you Get ER Done and support this campaign to produce the 2nd edition of Get ER Done. Go to the right -->> and pick a great perk and contribute now.Time for a reset and readjustment In 2011, I wrote my first book ""Get ER Done - The Green Beret Guide to Productivity."" The book had good success with 28 of 29 positive reviews (you can't please everyone.)




Since then I have developed my writing producing more books - ""Train Your Brain"", ""Improvise, Adapt, Overcome"", ""How to Get the Book Inside Your Head Inside a Book"" and others. After awhile everything needs a re-look and rejuvenation. We are relaunching ""Get ER Done"" with a new cover, a new format and updated content to appeal to a larger audience and get our tips, tactics and strategies out to as many people as possible. 

The Secret of the Special Forces


In the Special Forces, Get Er Done was simply a way of life. One 
of Special Forces’ mottos is “improvise, adapt, overcome.” The concept 
is that we would take the situation as it was. There wasn’t time or 
energy to waste on bemoaning what it should be. We would then take the 
skills we had, learn very quickly, or could purchase and get er done. 
The end result was most often success. The process might not follow the 
original plan. Because we approached things with the mindset of success 
we stacked the deck and found the resources to make it happen.
In reality, us in the super achieving, get er done Special Forces have 
the same amount of time in their days as anyone. Our secret is that we
 learned techniques to make ourselves highly effective.
 I shared ten of the best techniques that people could use to 
get them started getting things done quickly and effectively. I made it 
an easy, quick read knowing that the last thing everyone needs is to be faced 
with a fifty page chapter on the benefits of goal setting, or a whole 
book on making to-do lists. 
What people need are techniques that they can 
use quickly and get instant results from. The answers were out there, 
but more often they took a lot of sweat and pain to learn them the hard 
way. Over the years in my training I came across techniques that worked 
for me and others and kept them in my “mental toolbox.” I am making it 
super easy for people and giving them the tools to Get Er Done.
Get Er Done – The Green Beret Guide to Productivity gives principles from which everyone will get amazing results and find that they are 
performing at levels never thought possible. It is a simple, easy-to-read system that gives a workable, proven list of things to put in action, right now and have positive results in
 getting things done. Some will fit an individual personality, some won’t. It is 
for each person to pick from and apply them immediately. 
There is no heavy 
reading and no long dialogue to struggle through. Just useful 
information that to use instantly to take total control of your 
life. You’ll see results from day one, and by the end of a month you 
will wonder why getting things done ever seemed to be a problem.

Keep Calm and Get ER Done

I have had many, many emails telling me about the great results they have gotten after putting in place the techniques from the book.
Here is a testimonial from a reader:
We all have busy lives; work, kids, families – and it seem these days that nothing ever gets any easier or slower.  Last weekend for me was no exception.
A childhood friend was getting married, and had invited us to her wedding.  We wanted to go, but the time restraints, and the costs to move a family of 4 back and forth in one weekend was beginning to mount up, so it was decided I would travel alone for this trip.
The trick was, this had to be fast, and accurate, and the wedding was in New York, and we live in North Carolina.  The entire trip was going to take place in 28 hours!  I had one day of leave, and had to be back on duty Monday morning at 0800. 
I would fly into NYC Saturday morning, get my rental car, and drive to the Poughkeepsie area (90 miles away) where I grew up.
I would go see a few old sites specific to my childhood, (high school, the track I used to train on, the old house I grew up in, the farm where my first job was, the old firehouse where I got my start in Firefighting, etc...)  Then head to the church for the wedding, then to the reception site that was 50 miles away, after the reception, go to my hotel and then spend the night, then fly home out of NYC in the morning.
On top of that, I really wanted to get to the WTC and see the Freedom Tower and memorial.  I only had Sunday before I went home to do this, and I really wanted to since it had been completed after my last visit to NYC in 2008.This trip needed to be planned out to the hour.  I had to allow for traffic, food, gas, tolls, and the incidentals that would or could fall in line.  I knew that if I didn’t plan this out, something would be missed – and I definitely couldn’t miss my flight back home!
I remembered reading in Mike Martel’s Book Get Er Done the format for Backward Planning.  I decided if there was every anytime that could benefit from using this method, this would be the weekend to do it!
So dressed in a suit, carrying my one lone bag – a GR1 backpack from GORUCK, I arrived at the airport in Raleigh NC for my 0630hr flight on Saturday morning, and headed north.  From that moment, to the moment I was wheels up on Sunday to come home, I was able to hit every single time hack, and still have time to spare on the end before I scheduled myself to fly home!
Walking out to the car on Sunday morning after my flight home, I replayed how fast the previous 28 hours had been.  I had accomplished so much, gotten to see and experience all that I wanted to, and was not rushed in the least due to the use of Backward Planning.  Thanks Mike!!
Andrew Meier is a 15 year veteran of the City of Raleigh Fire Department in Raleigh NC, where he currently holds the rank of Captain.  He is a husband, and father to 2 young and very busy girls who keep him on the go!


Here's a couple more:
“What a great read! Mike does a great job of taking his years of 
Green Beret training and military skills into real life practical how 
to’s for succeeding in life. He translates the highly effective and 
intense training of the US military Green Berets and applies it to every
 day civilian steps and systems to help people achieve their dreams.” 

Tom Haupt—Leadership Expert, Motivational Speaker and Best-selling 
author of TIME-OUT! Winning Strategies for Playing a Bigger Game in Life


Hello, I don't often review books although I read many of them. This 
book was great because their was no fluff. It took 30 to 45 minutes to 
read, and everything was applicable to life, especially if you use a 
little creativity. I have read mostly psychology books and everything in
 here fit right in with what I know about psychology and 
neuroplasticity, but there was no explanation as to why it works in the 
book. I guess there is no need to explain why it works if it works, 
especially in an organization such as the military, where efficiency is 
key, and there is no room for theory. Great value, especially the kindle
 edition. I thought the title was cheesy, ""get er done"", but I was 
pleasantly surprised, the book gets er done...quickly.

<h2>Excerpt</h2>
<p><span>Seth and I were driving out to Mountain View to go hiking. I’d never been hiking before, so the closest thing I had to hiking boots were a pair of work boots that Skylar had bought while we were renovating our condo and he’d insisted I wear them. I swiftly threw my hair up into a sloppy ponytail and dashed out the door, keys and phone in hand. <em>Did I brush my teeth?</em> I cupped my hands over my mouth to smell my breath. No. I ran back inside, did a quick brush, grabbed a stick of gum for added defense and was out the door again. </span></p>
<p><span>“Hi,” I said breathlessly, giving Seth a quick peck on the lips when I’d stepped off the elevator. “So sorry to keep you waiting.”</span></p>
<p><span>“Don’t worry about it. It was worth it, you look great.” </span></p>
<p><span>“Thanks.” </span></p>
<p><span>“Are you ready for this?” he asked.</span></p>
<p><span>“Not really, but let’s go before I come to my senses.”  We laughed lightly. </span></p>
<p><span>Seth promised to take it easy on me, so he’d picked an easy trail for us to hike. I was still worried, because his brand of easy and mine could be vastly different. He told me the name of the trail, but I could hardly pronounce it properly. Every time he said it I heard: Eric Estrada. So I personally dubbed it the Estrada Trail. He thought that was hilarious and laughed, hard. He was like the awkwardly amused. Like the one person who finds a joke hilarious and goes to bits laughing, while everyone else gives a short chuckle and moves on. He’s that guy.</span></p>
<p><span>By the time we got to the trail my nervousness was apparent. I was inherently clumsy and he wanted to take me somewhere that would, no doubt, exhibit that particular trait of mine. Admittedly, this hike was easy...for Seth. He glided along the path like we were on an escalator, while I fumbled alongside him. It wasn’t all bad, there were moments of enjoyment. He even packed a backpack full of snacks. He also considered my love for sweets and packed chocolate covered energy bars. He was very proud of himself and I appreciated his thoughtfulness. Unfortunately for me, this thoughtful little bar tasted like chocolate covered dirt. I suffered through it. I didn’t want to discredit his efforts. A few hours later, sweaty and tired—I was anyway—the hike came to an end. Seth looked like he’d only taken a walk to the mailbox. </span></p>
<p><span>We went to a tiny restaurant nearby for a late lunch or an early dinner, depending on perspective. I couldn’t believe how hungry I was. Seth was in awe of my ravenous appetite. He was staring with a slight grin. We’d been out to eat many times, but I was never so hungry or careless about how I was perceived. </span></p>
<p><span>“What?” I asked, swallowing. Was he even eating or just creepily watching me?</span></p>
<p><span>“Nothing.” He smiled. “I’ve never seen you eat so much. That hike must have really taken a lot out of you.” No kidding. I thought to myself before responding aloud.</span></p>
<p><span>“It certainly did and I forgot to eat breakfast this morning.” </span></p>
<p><span>“That explains it.” I smiled, noticing that he had not eaten very much at all.</span></p>
<p><span>“You’re not hungry?” I asked. I doubt if he’d even broken a light sweat under his shirt, whereas I was certain he could probably smell me from across the table. Being the gentleman that he was, he’d never reveal that to me. </span></p>
<p><span>“Not really, but please don’t let that deter you.” </span></p>

Excerpt
Seth and I were driving out to Mountain View to go hiking.

<p>When I worked as a maternity nurse, I assisted many women during<br/>labor and delivery. I have always loved those beautiful big tummies, and each <br/>birth was special and touching. Many times I wondered how I would experience my own pregnancy and delivery. Thankfully, one day a pregnancy test showed a very clear pink dot! </p>
<p>I was awestruck by the life inside me, and I wanted to let my unborn baby experience the love of God as I had. From the moment I found out I was pregnant I wanted to pray for my baby but sadly could not find any books or magazines that could teach me how to do that so I began to search the Bible for relevant stories and verses for each stage of the baby’s development and I found many! I used all the Bible verses I found in my prayers and decided to write my pregnancy experience down. Since the prayers and journaling helped me so much throughout my pregnancy I decided that I wanted to create a journal that would combine both the medical and practical with the spiritual. The pregnancy journal ""BabySweet"" is my gift to all the beautiful women who would like to actively involve God in their pregnancy.</p>

A look at four generations of African-Americans; their lives, loves, passions, food, victories and tragedies told in part from the perspective of a Raven that falls in love with a young slave so much she wants to become a human girl to be with him.The book follows the lives of several characters, Among them Henna Brown; hair styling healer, wife, mother and transformer of her own life. Meet her by  reading an excerpt here.
   
When?My goal is to have the writing of the book completed by December so that it reaches your hands with all the fine intentions in which I have written it by February 2015.$5 Donations receive a downloadable pdf of my 58 page poetry & photography collection.Where?The book will then be available globally across the full range of e-book reading devices (Kindle, iBook, etc.) As a hardcopy via Amazon and other online bookstores.Who?I am a wife, mother, artist, poet and writer. Blackbird's Theory of Beauty is my youngest baby. I’ve chosen to self-publish, maintaining creative control and staying loyal to my characters is important to me.  Self-publishing also fits in line with my overall approach to living: DYI.  I am extremely passionate about this book and want to present it to my readers the way I’d present you with a plate of food if you were eating at my house; with my own two hands and with love.  Why?Holding a book, running my hands over the cover art, relishing the words, being enlightened, amused, entertained, having the pages become dog eared from so much handling and rereading has been therapy for my spiritual fractures, healing for the wounds inflicted to my soul and a joy to my heart all of my life. Those books live in my mind as good friends. My hope is that this book will serve as a friend, a companion and encouragement to anyone who has ever been lonely, unhappily married, desperate, sick, hungry, in debt or who has felt insecure, over-weight, under-weight, weak, poor, ugly, competitive, hateful, empty, unloved, overlooked or unseen.How?This is where you come in.  Indiegogo is a wonderful platform for this self-publishing author to collect advance payments to guarantee the funding necessary for the production of a beautiful and professional book that can hold it’s own against any book produced by the big publishing houses. If you believe in Blackbird'd Theory of Beauty’s journey to publication I am asking for funding to help with these things:•  Developmental Editing

•  Proofreading
•  Allow Printing In Bulk To Bring Down The Per-Book Costs
•  Obtaining Isbn Numbers,
•  Paying Registration Fees
•  Additional Costs Associated With Getting Listed In Various Online  Bookstores
•  Promotion, Such As Google, Adwords, Etc.
•  Envelopes, Packing Materials, Postage
•  Extra Review Copies
I will be laying out (typesetting) the book myself.  I will also be designing and formatting the book, as well as promoting it myself.  The book will be available as a hardcopy and e-book.

I am a writer, artist and spirit-worker (if you aren't already familiar with my work, visit <a href=""http://www.birdspiritland.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">BirdSpiritLand.com</a>) in the Pacific Northwest. I am hoping to <b>start work on my next book soon</b> (which will likely take at least a year to write), about the wonderful ubiquitous <b>Amanita muscaria</b> mushroom.

I wrote this book because I wanted to learn more about the incredible technologies that were going to “save our world.” Instead, I quickly learned that technology alone can’t do anything; it’s the idealists and dreamers behind each new innovation and effort that make our world a better place.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how you and the people around you can use technologies - common and complex - to make a difference. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for idealistic innovation. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a toolkit to help you make an impact on the causes that matter most to you.</p>
<p>In this book, you'll learn about the principles of idealistic innovation, and how everyday people can make an incredible impact using commonly available tools. You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>Fabien Cousteau’s mission to build a network of underwater space stations, PROTEUS</li>

</h3>
<p><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction + chapters 1 - 4.

It also includes tools that the reader can keep in mind as they continue their idealistic innovation trek, including an overview of world-changing technologies and a brief guide to design thinking principles.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 5 - 10. This section walks the reader through the principles of idealistic innovation through storytelling and the experiences of other people around the world who are using technology to make a difference. From a couple who created a Solar Suitcase to provide light to medical clinics in remote parts of the world to an animal activist who has used social media to continue championing the cause of Asian Elephants during the pandemic, this section walks through the principles that make idealistic innovation efforts successful.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains chapters 11 - 14. Prepped with your new knowledge of technologies and the principles of idealistic innovation, this section is your trail map to changing the world!

 a magazine of social-political speculative fiction, has been publishing
 feminist SF, queer SF, eco-SF, postcolonial SF, cyberpunk and horror with diverse and inclusive themes,
since 2005. To celebrate our tenth birthday this year, we plan to 
publish an anthology containing a mixture of reprints, enhanced 
stories, and new material, including sequels and other spin-offs, new 
artwork and satirical or speculative pseudo-fiction. The anthology will 
be edited by Djibril al-Ayad (editor-in-chief of TFF magazine since 2005
 and owner of Futurefire.net Publishing), Cécile Matthey (in-house 
illustrator at TFF magazine since 2006, and assistant editor since 
2014), and Valeria Vitale (copyeditor and assistant editor of TFF 
magazine since 2012).</p><p>For a flavor of the range of queer and other content we've published in the past, see this list of <a href=""http://press.futurefire.net/2015/08/quiltbag-stories-in-tff.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Quiltbag stories in TFF, 2005-2015</a>.<br/></p><p>We are raising money via pre-orders on this fundraiser to pay authors and artists for the use of their 
work; any further income made from sales will be paid as royalties or 
pushed back into the magazine to pay more authors in the future. If we 
reach the initial goal of $2,000, we will be able to
 pay an average of $50 per story, and a fair amount for microfiction 
and art, with the rest going on IGG fees and honoring rewards for
 backers. Any further funds we receive above this will go into 
increasing the fees further, or raising the pay rate for authors and 
artists of TFF magazine or one of our other publications. The TFF press

<br/><b>Risks:<br/><br/></b>Since about half the contents of the TFFX anthology will be reprints or stories that we already have in hand, and most of the contents are from authors and artists with whom we have existing relationships, there is little to no danger of our failing to find the material to fill the anthology.

<h3><strong>Malo o meni...</strong></h3>
<p><br/>Zovem se Davor Novevski, živim i radim u Cavtatu i san mi je jednog dana ozbiljno se baviti književnošću. Neko vrijeme pisao sam kolumne za jedan lokalni web portal, a nekoliko pjesama objavljeno mi je i u zborniku Društva dubrovačkih pisaca <i>Literat. </i>U lipnju prošle godine izdao sam svoj književni prvijenac – zbirku pripovijetki „Ravno do dna“ koja objedinjuje tri pripovijetke čija se radnja događa u Dubrovniku i okolici. Oba izdanje knjige rasprodana su gotovo odmah po izlasku što me, uz brojne pozitivne kritike, potaklo na izdavanje prvog pravog romana.​</p>
<h3><strong>Malo o knjizi...</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<p>Roman naslova „Teorija sjene“ priča je o neobičnom prijateljstvu između dvoje ljudi  koji naizgled nemaju ništa zajedničko osim činjenice da žive u istoj zgradi i da su im traume koje su doživjeli u prošlosti obilježile živote koje trenutno vode. Žanrovski, radi se o kriminalističkom romanu, ali on je i mnogo više od toga. On je i priča o kajanju, grijesima iz prošlosti i moralnim dilemama u kojima se svatko od nas prije ili kasnije nađe. Na dvjestotinjak stranica „Teorija sjene“ govori o stvarnom putovanju dvoje likova, ali i metaforičkom putovanju prema spokoju i iskupljenju usput secirajući život i međuljudske odnose u Dubrovniku i okolici kroz zanimljive situacije u koje glavni likovi upadaju i ljude koje na svom putu susreću.</p>

<h3>Kako uplatiti? </h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p>Vrlo jednostavno. Klikom na polje <i>BACK IT</i> koje se nalazi odmah pri vrhu stranice ili na jedno od polja naslova <i>GET THIS PERK </i>otvara se novi prozor u koji upisujete svoje podatke i čim ih potvrdite, i službeno ste dio moje kampanje. Bitno je napomenuti da je Indiegogo u potpunosti provjerena i sigurna platforma tako da ne postoji bojazan da će bilo tko zloupotrijebiti vaše podatke.<br/> </p>
<h3><strong>Zašto sam se uopće odlučio za crowdfunding?</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Odluka o grupnom financiranju ovog romana nije bila niti malo laka. Crowdfunding je u nas još uvijek u svojim začecima i samo upoznavanje ljudi s ovim konceptom predstavlja svojevrstan izazov. Ipak, odlučio sam se na pokretanje ovog projekta jer, osim realnih rizika s kojima ću se suočiti, pruža mi i neke dragocjene informacije i saznanja pa ću se tako u ovih mjesec dana koliko kampanja traje imati priliku uvjeriti koliko ljudi doista vjeruje u mene i tko je sve spreman prepoznati i podržati ono što radim.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Još malo o perkovima...</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>S desne strane vaših ekrana nalaze se takozvani perkovi (perks) – mali znakovi pažnje i nagrade koje dobivate za donirane iznose. Iako svaki iznos nosi neki određeni dar (perk), niti jedan od njih nije fiksan i svi su oni podložni dogovoru pa ako na primjer već imate svoj primjerak zbirke „Ravno do dna“, umjesto njega možete dobiti dva primjerka nove knjige isl.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Kako još možete pomoći?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Možda nema svatko dovoljno novca za doniranje, ali to ne znali da ne može sudjelovati u mojoj crowdfunding kampanji. Čitav koncept velikim se dijelom zasniva na „usmenoj predaji“ i pokušaju da se dopre do što većeg broja ljudi što znači da je svaki lajk i svako dijeljenje na Facebooku dragocjeno. Dakle, lajkajte objave vezane za crowdfunding, dijelite ih na društvenim mrežama (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) i odvojite sat-dva za dolazak na promociju knjige, a ja ću sigurno pronaći način da vam se odužim. </p>

Oba izdanje knjige rasprodana su gotovo odmah po izlasku što me, uz brojne pozitivne kritike, potaklo na izdavanje prvog pravog romana.​
Malo o knjizi...

 
Roman naslova „Teorija sjene“ priča je o neobičnom prijateljstvu između dvoje ljudi  koji naizgled nemaju ništa zajedničko osim činjenice da žive u istoj zgradi i da su im traume koje su doživjeli u prošlosti obilježile živote koje trenutno vode. Žanrovski, radi se o kriminalističkom romanu, ali on je i mnogo više od toga. On je i priča o kajanju, grijesima iz prošlosti i moralnim dilemama u kojima se svatko od nas prije ili kasnije nađe. Na dvjestotinjak stranica „Teorija sjene“ govori o stvarnom putovanju dvoje likova, ali i metaforičkom putovanju prema spokoju i iskupljenju usput secirajući život i međuljudske odnose u Dubrovniku i okolici kroz zanimljive situacije u koje glavni likovi upadaju i ljude koje na svom putu susreću.

Kako uplatiti? 
 
Vrlo jednostavno. Klikom na polje BACK IT koje se nalazi odmah pri vrhu stranice ili na jedno od polja naslova GET THIS PERK otvara se novi prozor u koji upisujete svoje podatke i čim ih potvrdite, i službeno ste dio moje kampanje. Bitno je napomenuti da je Indiegogo u potpunosti provjerena i sigurna platforma tako da ne postoji bojazan da će bilo tko zloupotrijebiti vaše podatke. 
Zašto sam se uopće odlučio za crowdfunding?
 
Odluka o grupnom financiranju ovog romana nije bila niti malo laka. Crowdfunding je u nas još uvijek u svojim začecima i samo upoznavanje ljudi s ovim konceptom predstavlja svojevrstan izazov. Ipak, odlučio sam se na pokretanje ovog projekta jer, osim realnih rizika s kojima ću se suočiti, pruža mi i neke dragocjene informacije i saznanja pa ću se tako u ovih mjesec dana koliko kampanja traje imati priliku uvjeriti koliko ljudi doista vjeruje u mene i tko je sve spreman prepoznati i podržati ono što radim.
 
Još malo o perkovima...
 
S desne strane vaših ekrana nalaze se takozvani perkovi (perks) – mali znakovi pažnje i nagrade koje dobivate za donirane iznose. Iako svaki iznos nosi neki određeni dar (perk), niti jedan od njih nije fiksan i svi su oni podložni dogovoru pa ako na primjer već imate svoj primjerak zbirke „Ravno do dna“, umjesto njega možete dobiti dva primjerka nove knjige isl.
 
Kako još možete pomoći?
 
Možda nema svatko dovoljno novca za doniranje, ali to ne znali da ne može sudjelovati u mojoj crowdfunding kampanji. Čitav koncept velikim se dijelom zasniva na „usmenoj predaji“ i pokušaju da se dopre do što većeg broja ljudi što znači da je svaki lajk i svako dijeljenje na Facebooku dragocjeno. Dakle, lajkajte objave vezane za crowdfunding, dijelite ih na društvenim mrežama (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) i odvojite sat-dva za dolazak na promociju knjige, a ja ću sigurno pronaći način da vam se odužim.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><i>Your Next Mission</i> - A journey from combat on the battlefield to a successful business, this book explores the pathways and lessons of veterans who transitioned out of the military and started a successful business.<br/><br/>My name is Tyler Reiser and I am the author of <i>Your Next Mission</i>. I wrote this book because I am on my own quest to start a successful business after the military. I wanted to learn from those who came before me in their transition and share these lessons with our fellow veterans.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how veterans are utilizing the lessons and skills they’ve developed during their military service to build and lead successful businesses in the private sector. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for entrepreneurship in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you start your own journey of following your dreams, in entrepreneurship or otherwise.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the veteran transition into entrepreneurship:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’ll hear about the challenges former infantryman, Casey Lawrence faced as he transitioned. After firefights and IEDs in Afghanistan to the oil fields of Texas, you’ll see how his nonlinear journey took him down dark paths and how he found redemption.</li>
<li>The Story of Sam Meek. Moving back home after the military he took up a job as a young caddie. Through a chance encounter, he got an interview at a hedge fund, his life would never be the same.</li>
<li>You’ll see how Donny O'Malley, a Marine, produces a $100,000 video production every 6-weeks, a feat never achieved by Hollywood.</li>
</ul>You will love this book if you are following your dreams, you’re a veteran or an entrepreneur. Your Next Mission is a non-fiction book that speaks to veterans and entrepreneurs who are transitioning out of the military and building a business for the first time.<p> </p>
<h3><i><span>Y</span>our Next Mission</i></h3>The book is written in 3 Parts...<br/><br/>Part [1] contains the introduction + 2 chapters. You will get a glimpse into the world of post 9/11 combat and the intense nature of the battlefield. We then explore the transition after the military with the struggles and successes that come with it. You’ll find that the incredible abilities used in combat that are often forgotten when we transition out of the military.<br/><br/>Part [2] contains Chapters 3-6. Identifying your purpose as a starting point we review methods used to develop a business model and the lessons learned from lean manufacturing and agile development to incorporate the scientific method into entrepreneurship. We look at the ideas of perseverance, and how veteran entrepreneurs like William Treseder are using daily wins to build a lifetime of passion.<br/><br/>Part [3] contains Chapters 7-10. Going at it alone is certainly destined for failure. In this section, we peer into the importance of developing a network, forms of obtaining capital, leadership, and culture. The actionable insights included from research and interviews provide a framework to develop an entrepreneurial support team. Doug Doan discusses the challenges veterans face in angel investments and Mark Rockefeller shows us ways veterans obtain debt financing.<br/> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Tiffany Green-Abdullah and I am the author of <i>The Bean Pie: 4 Generations of Faith, Family, and Fortitude</i>. </p>
<p>I wrote this book as a tribute to the voiceless women in my family who endured pain and sacrifice beyond comprehension so that our family can exist as it does today. My role is to write this so that we can uplift them and honor their commitment and sacrifice into a hopeful future. I want my children and future generations to know that they are not here by accident. The toil of our ancestors, including the success and mistakes make us who we are. No one is perfect, but it takes strength and fortitude to keep going and learn from one generation to the next. I am leaning on that strength myself as I write this book during one of the most challenging times the world has seen.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover an unknown story about the bean pie and my family’s history in the Nation of Islam. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you understand the internal pain that these women endured in breaking cycles for our future.</p>
<p>This book is a legacy for my family and my way to connect with my past, remind me of how far I have come and my family's history. This book is a guide to our future family to remember and acknowledge our journeys.  Making bean pies connected me to my past and created a curiosity that led me to become an author.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about Faith, Forgiveness, and Fortitude, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>How my mother, at age 14, helped to spread the bean pie from Chicago to all over the nation.</li>
<li>How Aunt Daisy migrated from Alabama to Detroit and then to Chicago and became a mogul.</li>
<li>How faith, family, and fortitude helped me overcome the death of two of my children.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you want to learn about unsung heroes behind history and how families can share their stories.</p>

I am leaning on that strength myself as I write this book during one of the most challenging times the world has seen.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover an unknown story about the bean pie and my family’s history in the Nation of Islam. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you understand the internal pain that these women endured in breaking cycles for our future.
This book is a legacy for my family and my way to connect with my past, remind me of how far I have come and my family's history. This book is a guide to our future family to remember and acknowledge our journeys.  Making bean pies connected me to my past and created a curiosity that led me to become an author.In this book, you'll learn about Faith, Forgiveness, and Fortitude, including:

How my mother, at age 14, helped to spread the bean pie from Chicago to all over the nation.
How Aunt Daisy migrated from Alabama to Detroit and then to Chicago and became a mogul.
How faith, family, and fortitude helped me overcome the death of two of my children.

You will love this book if you want to learn about unsung heroes behind history and how families can share their stories.

The Impact
Your contribution is about more than money. It sends a message to me and to the world that we need more voices, especially Black women writers and Black family stories. 
I hope that you are here because you care about this project and how it might inspire someone. I hope you know I have a track record of success in my career, in my community and this book is the next step for me. I plan to speak at schools, book clubs, and any organization with an interest.
It is not easy to share so many personal stories with the world, but I hope by doing so, I can impact someone who is not sure how they are going to make it through a difficult period.

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes it. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.

This is the 2nd crowdfund to raise the last bit. I am especially seeking youth-serving organizations and schools that can purchase the larger perk packages which come with a set of books and a speaking engagement just for the organization.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I have spent many years exploring natural areas in Texas, writing for herpetological societies and Texas Parks &amp; Wildlife Magazine, and giving educational talks. I co-authored a first book (with Clint King), ""<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Herping-Texas-Reptiles-Amphibians-Langford/dp/1623496640/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1EP40KXZEJXKT&amp;keywords=herping+texas&amp;qid=1566084286&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=Herping+Texas%2Caps%2C194&amp;sr=8-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Herping Texas,</a>"" published last year. I work as a Psychological Associate, but communicating about the natural world is a first love.</p>
<p>It has always been my hope that my writing will make readers feel as if they've stood where I have been in forests, prairies, and deserts that I describe. I want readers to go visit these places and see the box turtles, rattlesnakes, salamanders, and other animals that I love. As I wrote this book, I thought about what would be the ideal book for me when I was a young teen. I wanted the book to educate and to inspire a love for the natural world.</p>
<p>A book like this might equip a young person to go find that first turtle, or hike an unspoiled preserve. It could spark a career in herpetology, but it can only do that if you help us get it printed.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Nonprofit publishers do a lot, but there's some things they do not do. The illustrations for the book were done by Jack Jeansonne, a talented artist who can bring things to life in a way that words cannot. The book's publishers do not pay for those illustrations. Also, the book has to have an index, and that's typically done by a contract professional. Here's what we need:</p>
<ul><li>$1800 will pay Jack for the series of illustrations he has prepared for the book. Another $800 will cover the production of the index for the book. </li></ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566074420/gngsv7vtplhy1lyxsqzr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>We want to show our appreciation to those who contribute. The perks we are offering include signed prints of photos or illustrations from the book, up to a signed copy of the completed book when it is published (see the listed perks for details).</li>
<li>If we do not raise the entire $2600, we will use what we do raise and find other funds to complete the project. In other words, we are committed to having the book published and will use your generous contributions - whatever amount you give.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Field herping is a growing hobby, and increasing numbers of young people and adults are interested in some aspect of herpetology. A book like this may guide people toward the wildlife and natural history side of the hobby, and I really would like to see that happen. There is nothing wrong with keeping a pet ball python or other herp, but you learn a great deal when you look at these animals as wildlife. The joy that comes from spending a day in the field and coming across a native species of snake or turtle is not soon forgotten. This book makes it more likely that a person new to field herping will know what to look for and how to stay safe. Readers will come away with a stronger conservation ethic when in the field.</p>
<p>The earlier book (co-authored with Clint King and also from Texas A&amp;M University Press) has done well, and I am confident that this project will be successfully completed as well. The manuscript is written and the illustrations completed. I've chosen plenty of photographs, supplemented with a few that friends and colleagues generously let me use. You can contribute to this project with confidence that Jack and I will hold up our end of the bargain. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As I mentioned, the manuscript is done, photographs taken (or contributed) and illustrations completed. If we were not able to raise enough funds to pay for Jack's illustrations or to get indexing done, I would explore whether there are any organizational grants or other ways to raise the money. As the project moves along, I will keep contributors informed of any challenges we encounter and strategies for addressing them.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot contribute money, you can still help in a big way! Share this link on places like Facebook or pass it along to friends. Let people know what this project might mean for increasing people's understanding of reptiles and amphibians. Remember that Indiegogo has share tools that can help with this!</p>

<h3><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h3>
<i>The River and the Woods</i> is a book set in the Northwoods of Wisconsin. On a business-related return home, a young professional must decide to love and revive his small hometown or to walk away and leave the career opportunity of a lifetime.<i> The River and the Woods</i> explores the intersection of industry and sustainability through the lens of personal ethics<br/><br/>My name is Jacob Gardner, and I am the author of <i>The River and the Woods.</i> I wrote this book because of my love-hate relationship with my hometown. Rural communities in Wisconsin—and all over the U.S.—are hurting. There’s a vacuum of jobs, and the towns are seeing a decline in their schools, culture, and communities. Worse yet, they are desperate for work, and they will trade anything they can to bring home the bread—even their waterways and natural beauties.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover an appreciation for rural America and maybe even rural Wisconsin. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to consider the context rural communities are in today. Together, we can consider how to improve the struggling towns without jeopardizing our planet.<br/><br/>Tucked in the pine and birch woods of northern Wisconsin, Matt Harris has business to do. Representing the company promising a better future to his hometown and state, Matt returns to find that towns and people can change—and drastically. Deprived of the once robust blue-collar work, buildings have been boarded up, the school has declined, politics have grown bitter, and poverty reigns supreme. The growing plight of rural and Midwestern USA has hit home. Determined to please both his boss and the town, Matt must confront his greatest dilemma: how to make his ambitions truly help the townspeople he so longs to forget. Through disasters of love, hate, ethics, and pride, Matt learns a lot about life on his visit home-—but at what cost and to whom?<br/><br/>You will love this book if you are a young professional, grew up in a rural town, or have an interest in sustainability.<br/><br/><i>The River and the Woods</i> speaks to professionals, sustainability advocates, and former or current ruralites who want to grapple with small town life or economics and vulnerability or morals in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>The River and the Woods</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:<ul>
<li>How far will you go for your pride or your career?</li>
<li>What does it really mean to love your home—town, state, or country?</li>
<li>What is the future going to be like? What will be the balance between everyday people’s prosperity and the earth’s well being?</li>
</ul> I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing division, bias, sustainability, a better economy, and vulnerability in professionalism will change us all for the better.<br/> <h3><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></h3> This book will be published with New Degree Press.

I wrote this book because I’m passionate about financial wealth and physical health. Both of those are directly tied to where you work. I kept meeting other high achieving corporate career professionals who like myself have the potential to go further in their careers, but their progress was being stifled. </p><p>Progress was often stifled by relying on the same tools that served us well in high school and college. Tools and habits that are now outdated and less effective. Tools that got us here, but will and only serve to hold us back if we don’t replace them with better ones.</p><p>Tools include:</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Mazlow's Hierarchy of Needs</strong> shifting away from operating in survival mode whereby we have an extreme fear of failing and making mistakes in our pursuit of safety and security </li>
<li>
<strong>Setting Healthy Boundaries</strong> overcoming the struggle to say no to others, stretching yourself too thin and taking responsibility for others’ shortcomings</li>
<li>
<strong>6 stage Job Lifecycle</strong> understanding when it is time to move on from a job you no longer love</li>
<li>
<strong>Overcoming Perfectionism</strong> Recognizing and letting go of all or nothing thinking, our inability to acknowledge own strengths combined with a hyper focus on weaknesses </li>
<li>
<strong>Self-care </strong>set realistic expectations, unlearn what no longer serves us and rely on peer, mentorship, coaches and therapy for support</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>We’re told to work twice as hard to get half as much and often experience anxiety, depression, frustration and disappointments in the workplace that go unaddressed. That is until now. I’m writing this book as a solution to the problems employees face, as a blueprint to help them get unstuck and as motivation and inspiration to let them know a better path ahead is possible.</p><p> </p><p>In this book, you'll learn the importance of dreaming big dreams, the power of mentorship inside and outside of work and the importance of resting and rejuvenating through narratives like:</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Meeting Chris Brown </strong>on the Oprah Winfrey Show while a student at Whitney M. Young High School -- the same high school Michelle Obama attended in Chicago, IL</li>
<li>
<strong>Taking time off from </strong>my first job out of college after I realized I wasn't feeling like myself</li>
<li>
<strong>Working with a new therapist</strong> who introduced me to concepts I had not heard of before, like perfectionism, all or nothing mentality and codependency</li>

I wrote this book because I’m passionate about financial wealth and physical health. Both of those are directly tied to where you work. I kept meeting other high achieving corporate career professionals who like myself have the potential to go further in their careers, but their progress was being stifled. Progress was often stifled by relying on the same tools that served us well in high school and college. Tools and habits that are now outdated and less effective. Tools that got us here, but will and only serve to hold us back if we don’t replace them with better ones.Tools include:

Mazlow's Hierarchy of Needs shifting away from operating in survival mode whereby we have an extreme fear of failing and making mistakes in our pursuit of safety and security 

Setting Healthy Boundaries overcoming the struggle to say no to others, stretching yourself too thin and taking responsibility for others’ shortcomings

6 stage Job Lifecycle understanding when it is time to move on from a job you no longer love

Overcoming Perfectionism Recognizing and letting go of all or nothing thinking, our inability to acknowledge own strengths combined with a hyper focus on weaknesses 

Self-care set realistic expectations, unlearn what no longer serves us and rely on peer, mentorship, coaches and therapy for support
 We’re told to work twice as hard to get half as much and often experience anxiety, depression, frustration and disappointments in the workplace that go unaddressed. That is until now. I’m writing this book as a solution to the problems employees face, as a blueprint to help them get unstuck and as motivation and inspiration to let them know a better path ahead is possible. In this book, you'll learn the importance of dreaming big dreams, the power of mentorship inside and outside of work and the importance of resting and rejuvenating through narratives like:

Meeting Chris Brown on the Oprah Winfrey Show while a student at Whitney M. Young High School -- the same high school Michelle Obama attended in Chicago, IL

Taking time off from my first job out of college after I realized I wasn't feeling like myself

Working with a new therapist who introduced me to concepts I had not heard of before, like perfectionism, all or nothing mentality and codependency
 You will love this book no matter what industry you're in, this book will save you time, money, and energy, as you begin or continue upon your corporate career journey.  Westside Girl, Stillness speaks to mid-career professionals, recent college graduates, and those graduating soon, who grapple with the question, is this really all there is to life: go to school, graduate, work and pay bills and who want to look grapple with wealth and the ""pursuit of happiness"" in a new way, in the form of sound mental health & well-being.Ultimately, I hope that Westside Girl, Stillness inspires reflection and fruitful discussion, around questions like:

<p>A Gory Story is a book I started working on in 2007. It is an interactive therapy book that comes illustrated and has a set of questions to accompany the book. As one reads the questions they write in their own story in the book. Over the past five years I have made a few different versions of the book and sent them out to be put to use. In the process I have made a few changes and now am ready to publish the book in its final form.</p>
<p>I need help from you to help print this book so it is available for girls who have been sexually abused.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED?</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>Is the funding needed to print runs of this book that we can distribute to advocacy centers and counselors. It would also help us with publicity for the book.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOU GET?</strong></p>
<p>Look to the right and you will see the perks we have for contributors.</p>
<p>and check the gallery to see a picture of the t shirt</p>
<p><strong>HOW WILL THIS BOOK AFFECT PEOPLE?</strong></p>
<p>This book will allow for someone to open up about being molested or sexually abused. Its a very hard subject for some people to open up about.  This book will let someone write out their story of what has happened to them.  Addressing the issue of what has happened is what A Gory Story lets take place.</p>
<p><strong>HOW DOES THE BOOK WORK?</strong></p>
<p>A Gory Story has simple questions to start with that are pretty straight forward. The pages of the book have their own questions that walk someone through gently the abuse that they have encountered.  As someone works in the book the questions stay simple in phrasing but tackle harder things.  Building a story on paper that has unfortunately already happened in life. Through answering the questions in the book a process of opening up about what has happened occurs.</p>
<p><strong>WHO ARE WE?</strong></p>
<p>Gregory Price, is the creator of the book and did the layout and initial design. This is my first book project and is the most important work of any form I have produced. I really believe it can have impacts in lots of lives that have been afflicted by sexual abuse.</p>
<p>Emily Salinas, is the illustrator.  I met Emily while in school and later on asked her to help me with the final illustrations to add a softer touch to the colors that my artistic skills could not produce. She is someone that I knew I could count on to put forth some amazing art work.</p>

<p class=""normal"">Writing a pitch like this is as daunting as composing a 20 page research paper 8 hours before it’s due in class. I think it would be easier to sell something like  “I’m a time traveler from the future, and I need your help to prevent the lemming overpopulation catastrophe of 2043.”  </p>
<p class=""normal""> My name is Steven Lacey. I’m 42 years old, and I am a writer.</p>
<p class=""normal"">     Initially, it was screenplays. I finally realized that the bonus of writing prose (as opposed to scripts) was that instead of having to count on other people to bring them to life, I just had to, you know, <em>write them</em>. I started with short fiction. After a few years, I had enough stories that I compiled them into an anthology, called <em>Everything In Its Right Place</em> (and available <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Everything-In-Its-Right-Place/dp/1419646818/ref=sr_1_14?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373349398&amp;sr=8-14&amp;keywords=everything+in+its+right+place"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Here"">here</a>). Not content with just writing short stories, however, I crafted them as puzzle pieces of a greater tale; every story in that book was connected to the others, creating a causal link to reveal a larger narrative in the background of the individual stories. It was ambitious, a little bit crazy, and – considering that it was entirely a word-of-mouth PR campaign – a modest success.</p>
<p class=""normal""><strong>      </strong>Now, while these new books represent my first attempt at writing novels, they are from a story that has been inside my head for the last 17 years. Ostensibly, the tales are space opera at its finest: the adventures of two officers who are on opposing sides in an interplanetary civil war. The conflict is between the inner and outer planets of the solar system, taking place in the early part of the 21<sup>st</sup> Century. Both stories are about the battles they get into, as well as the day-to-day lives of these characters in more of a down-to-earth kind of way. Since I’m a contrary son-of-a-gun, these books also represent a rather ambitious idea: with both stories built around that central conflict, the protagonist of each book serves as a minor antagonist in the other one, and the novels begin and end at almost the exact same time, with various crossovers throughout the narrative.</p>
<p class=""normal"">      When I say these novels are space operas, that’s because there’s more going on than might appear at first glance. Rather than spoil the surprise – there’s a minor twist at the end of each chapter (the same twist, in fact) – I ask you to please click <a href=""http://geeksexsymbol.blogspot.com/2012/10/JovianFrontier.html#more"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""BluebadaBlue"">here (blue)</a> or <a href=""http://geeksexsymbol.blogspot.com/2013/04/okay-yall.html#more"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Red (here)"">here(red)</a>, where you can read each book’s first chapter in its entirety to get a better idea of what I mean. While you’re at it, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Jovian-Frontier/583881178303291"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""this link"">this link</a> will take you to the Facebook page I have for the series itself, so you can give it a like and show your support. (they contain adult language and situations, so reader discretion is advised).</p>
<p class=""normal"">      How did I come to finish these two novels? A little over three years ago, my mother passed away suddenly, after an unexpected illness. She was my greatest inspiration, a talented artist in her own right, and one of my biggest fans and cheerleaders. Her sudden death was easily the most difficult thing I’ve ever had to deal with, but it also shook me awake. While I really liked my coworkers,- I didn’t love my job, I actively disliked upper management, and I flat out hated the company I worked for.   I had been presented with a serious wake-up call- and an opportunity- she left me an inheritance. With this, and a little bit of savings, I took the leap that I had been avoiding for years. I quit my job to do what I love: write.</p>
<p class=""normal"">     Fun fact #1: Quitting your job to write full time could enable you to finish a novel (As I have! Two novels! Completed!).</p>
<p class=""normal"">     Fun fact #2: Quitting your job to write full time takes a lot out of the bank account. All of it, in fact.</p>
<p class=""normal"">      Which is why I started this campaign: I need your help to keep my dream alive-  long enough to actually publish these books. </p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></h3>
<div>
<p class=""normal"">      So. I am asking for the bare minimum to keep the wolves at bay while I edit the books and ready them for publication. While a lot of the funding will be doing just that, a lot if it will be going toward the perks in that lovely side-bar: stickers, t-shirts, actual paper versions of the book, airfare and car rental (if any of y’all are crazy enough to jump on the more expensive swag-train), plus the giant doomsday machine I am currently building in my basement (JUST KIDDING! I live in Charleston, South Carolina; we don’t have basements. I’m building it in my garage).</p>
<p class=""normal"">     With these stories, I will build a world and create a franchise; further tales and back-stories from this world could fill several books, ones that I (and others) intend to tell in the months and years ahead. By contributing to this campaign, you will be helping to shape the reality of The Jovian Frontier from now until... whenever. So, not only are you helping me, personally, you’re also influencing this fictional world in ways that will have lasting effects. And, let’s face it, who doesn’t want to wield power, at least a little bit? Reading this right now, you’re cradling the Jovian Frontier in your palm. Will you wield this newfound power villainously by dropping it- ending your power right there - or will you be a part of the future? It’s up to you!</p>
<p class=""normal"">     Now, if I <em>don’t</em> meet my fundraising goal, then what does that mean? Well, the whole project won’t just dry up and go away; I will continue editing as time permits. With your support, I will be able to publish in late September/early October. Without it...</p>
<p class=""normal"">      I will make sure that every perk gets fulfilled. I will finish these books. One place I promise the money will NOT be going: dance lessons (If you’ve already watched the video, you know I have some super-sweet moves; you just can’t improve upon perfection). </p>
<h3 class=""normal""> The (Deep, Insightful, Personal) Impact</h3>
<p class=""normal"">      This story-world has the potential to become something significant. As I said earlier, the back-story is rich and detailed. The characters are unique and interesting, and the stories themselves are a lot of fun, covering a lot of ground, literally and figuratively.  My goal is for this to be the start of a franchise with a broad appeal to geeks and nerds of all stripes; to that end, I’ve done my best to write positive role-model characters of varying sexes, races, and orientations. Also, for anyone to whom this kind of thing is important (which, honestly, should be everyone), both books would have the ability to pass the Bechdel Test. I hope these stories resonate with people, make them excited. I aim to make the reader rethink how they perceive and interact with other geeks and nerds who may seem different from them at first glance. I know that’s a pretty ambitious plan for a couple of pseudo-sci-fi novels by an unknown author, but I firmly believe you have to dream big to win big. So, this is me, dreaming big.</p>
<h3>I'm Broke But I Want To Help Out Anyway? What Can I Do?</h3>
<p class=""normal"">     I included the one dollar contribution level so that even the most cash-strapped person can donate to this campaign. If you cannot contribute, it’s entirely probable that you know people who can. It takes less time to share this on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or any other social media site than it will to read this sentence. Please help me get the word out and let other folks know about it. The more help I get, the more editing I get done, the quicker the stories get out, the faster I can start to change the world.</p>
<p class=""normal"">     Yeah, that’s right, I want to change the world, too.</p>
<p class=""normal"">     Thanks for taking the time to read all of this, and let’s build the Jovian Frontier together.</p>

Not content with just writing short stories, however, I crafted them as puzzle pieces of a greater tale; every story in that book was connected to the others, creating a causal link to reveal a larger narrative in the background of the individual stories. It was ambitious, a little bit crazy, and – considering that it was entirely a word-of-mouth PR campaign – a modest success.
      Now, while these new books represent my first attempt at writing novels, they are from a story that has been inside my head for the last 17 years. Ostensibly, the tales are space opera at its finest: the adventures of two officers who are on opposing sides in an interplanetary civil war. The conflict is between the inner and outer planets of the solar system, taking place in the early part of the 21st Century. Both stories are about the battles they get into, as well as the day-to-day lives of these characters in more of a down-to-earth kind of way. Since I’m a contrary son-of-a-gun, these books also represent a rather ambitious idea: with both stories built around that central conflict, the protagonist of each book serves as a minor antagonist in the other one, and the novels begin and end at almost the exact same time, with various crossovers throughout the narrative.
      When I say these novels are space operas, that’s because there’s more going on than might appear at first glance. Rather than spoil the surprise – there’s a minor twist at the end of each chapter (the same twist, in fact) – I ask you to please click here (blue) or here(red), where you can read each book’s first chapter in its entirety to get a better idea of what I mean. While you’re at it, this link will take you to the Facebook page I have for the series itself, so you can give it a like and show your support. (they contain adult language and situations, so reader discretion is advised).
      How did I come to finish these two novels? A little over three years ago, my mother passed away suddenly, after an unexpected illness. She was my greatest inspiration, a talented artist in her own right, and one of my biggest fans and cheerleaders. Her sudden death was easily the most difficult thing I’ve ever had to deal with, but it also shook me awake. While I really liked my coworkers,- I didn’t love my job, I actively disliked upper management, and I flat out hated the company I worked for.   I had been presented with a serious wake-up call- and an opportunity- she left me an inheritance. With this, and a little bit of savings, I took the leap that I had been avoiding for years. I quit my job to do what I love: write.
     Fun fact #1: Quitting your job to write full time could enable you to finish a novel (As I have! Two novels! Completed!).
     Fun fact #2: Quitting your job to write full time takes a lot out of the bank account. All of it, in fact.
      Which is why I started this campaign: I need your help to keep my dream alive-  long enough to actually publish these books. 
What We Need & What You Get

      So. I am asking for the bare minimum to keep the wolves at bay while I edit the books and ready them for publication. While a lot of the funding will be doing just that, a lot if it will be going toward the perks in that lovely side-bar: stickers, t-shirts, actual paper versions of the book, airfare and car rental (if any of y’all are crazy enough to jump on the more expensive swag-train), plus the giant doomsday machine I am currently building in my basement (JUST KIDDING! I live in Charleston, South Carolina; we don’t have basements. I’m building it in my garage).
     With these stories, I will build a world and create a franchise; further tales and back-stories from this world could fill several books, ones that I (and others) intend to tell in the months and years ahead. By contributing to this campaign, you will be helping to shape the reality of The Jovian Frontier from now until... whenever. So, not only are you helping me, personally, you’re also influencing this fictional world in ways that will have lasting effects. And, let’s face it, who doesn’t want to wield power, at least a little bit? Reading this right now, you’re cradling the Jovian Frontier in your palm. Will you wield this newfound power villainously by dropping it- ending your power right there - or will you be a part of the future? It’s up to you!
     Now, if I don’t meet my fundraising goal, then what does that mean? Well, the whole project won’t just dry up and go away; I will continue editing as time permits. With your support, I will be able to publish in late September/early October. Without it...
      I will make sure that every perk gets fulfilled. I will finish these books. One place I promise the money will NOT be going: dance lessons (If you’ve already watched the video, you know I have some super-sweet moves; you just can’t improve upon perfection). 
 The (Deep, Insightful, Personal) Impact
      This story-world has the potential to become something significant. As I said earlier, the back-story is rich and detailed. The characters are unique and interesting, and the stories themselves are a lot of fun, covering a lot of ground, literally and figuratively.  My goal is for this to be the start of a franchise with a broad appeal to geeks and nerds of all stripes; to that end, I’ve done my best to write positive role-model characters of varying sexes, races, and orientations. Also, for anyone to whom this kind of thing is important (which, honestly, should be everyone), both books would have the ability to pass the Bechdel Test. I hope these stories resonate with people, make them excited. I aim to make the reader rethink how they perceive and interact with other geeks and nerds who may seem different from them at first glance. I know that’s a pretty ambitious plan for a couple of pseudo-sci-fi novels by an unknown author, but I firmly believe you have to dream big to win big. So, this is me, dreaming big.
I'm Broke But I Want To Help Out Anyway? What Can I Do?
     I included the one dollar contribution level so that even the most cash-strapped person can donate to this campaign. If you cannot contribute, it’s entirely probable that you know people who can. It takes less time to share this on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or any other social media site than it will to read this sentence. Please help me get the word out and let other folks know about it. The more help I get, the more editing I get done, the quicker the stories get out, the faster I can start to change the world.
     Yeah, that’s right, I want to change the world, too.
     Thanks for taking the time to read all of this, and let’s build the Jovian Frontier together.

Thank you so much for helping me publish this artisanal publishing project that celebrates the passion of artisanal chocolate. I am truly grateful to have you on Team Chocolatour.

<p><strong>L’Oiseau – a Message of Hope for All Mankind</strong></p>
<p>In August 2016 a little book by Swiss author Eveline Porter was published in French by the Persée publishers. This delightful little book tells the story of how a newly-hatched red bird was found and looked after by the author and her cat, became fully-fledged and begins to speak to the author. L’Oiseau, as she calls the bird, tells us the story of how seriously ill the earth is and points the way to healing.</p>
<p>Our publishing house now wants to publish a bi-lingual version (English and Esperanto) of this book in spring 2017 because the bird's message deserves to be be spread throughout the entire world.</p>

<p><strong>About the Author</strong></p>
<p>Ever since her earliest childhood, the author, who was in 1961, has had a genuine and sympathetic interest in nature, science and animals. In her search for the truth and the secrets of life she often asks questions that disturb her immediate surroundings.</p>
<p>Her father, a keen amateur astronomer, taught her his tremendous fascination for the infinite vastness which she understandably transferred to the infinitesimal. He also showed her how to recognise fossils as witnesses to the past and evolution.</p>
<p>Her numerous travels enabled her to constantly explore ever-distant horizons and to immerse herself in various cultures and creeds. She developed an unreserved devotion to the beauty and diversity of nature, thereby venerating life in all its possible forms. She finds the answers she seeks in their purest form when she shows us nature if one perceives it with the heed of a pure heart.</p>
<p>In a three-year stay in Alaska she experienced landscapes of awe-inspiring vastness, the Northern Lights and a fauna that had adapted to this merciless environment. In these infinite landscapes she was awed to discover how precious and fragile life is. All these experiences and encounters finally inspired her to write the story of L’Oiseau.</p>

</div><br/>Hallo Welt, ich bin Willy. Seit ca. 15 Jahren bin ich ""freier Künstler"" oder wie auch immer man das nennt, wenn man beim Bäcker mit selbstgestalteten Postkarten bezahlen will (""Scher dich RAUS, du Lump!""). <br/><br/>Ich liebe die Kunst. Atme für die Kunst. Und lebe für die Kunst.<br/>Zwischendurch mache ich kommerzielle Sachen - wie z.B. die ZDFneo Zeichentrickserie ""Deutsches Fleisch"", Gags schreiben für Extra 3 oder Einkäufe erledigen für alte Menschen (ihr glaubt nicht, was man da verdient!).<br/><div>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/>Aber eigentlich will ich nur meine Kunst machen. Unzensiert, roh und ehrlich. Das gelingt mir immer besser, aber leicht ist es nicht. Man muss ja doch Miete zahlen (und laufende Unterhaltskosten für die ständig hungrigen Ausrutscher einer EINZIGEN Nacht... ICH HASSE DICH, VERA! DU HAST MICH REINGELEGT!)</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Jetzt habe ich dieses Buch geschrieben. Also genauer gesagt, schreibe ich es gerade noch fertig. Geht ja heute: Dinge verkaufen, bevor es sie gibt. Früher nannte man das Betrug. Heute Crowdfunding. </span><br/></p>
<b>""Snickers für Linkshänder - Das Buch""</b> ist eine Kurzgeschichtensammlung voller absurder Alltagssituationen, teils real, teils Phantasie, teils unerhört übertrieben, teils so dermaßen echt, wie nur unsere verrückte Welt sein kann. Wer damit jetzt so GAR NICHTS anfangen kann, wird am Ende dieses Textes eine kleine Auswahl vorfinden.<br/><br/>Ja, das Buch ist etwas teurer als ein Paperback im Buchhandel. Das liegt daran, dass ich weder eine Agentur, noch einen Verlag im Rücken habe und alles (vom Schreiben, über Layout bis zum Vertrieb) komplett in Eigenregie mache. Nur Lesen müsst ihr es schon selbst. </div><div><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Ich habe viel Mühe und Liebe in diese Texte gesteckt und freue mich darüber, sie nun endlich mit der Welt zu teilen.

""Hier könnte IHRE Empfehlung stehen!""Snickers für Linkshänder
Hallo Welt, ich bin Willy. Seit ca. 15 Jahren bin ich ""freier Künstler"" oder wie auch immer man das nennt, wenn man beim Bäcker mit selbstgestalteten Postkarten bezahlen will (""Scher dich RAUS, du Lump!""). Ich liebe die Kunst. Atme für die Kunst. Und lebe für die Kunst.Zwischendurch mache ich kommerzielle Sachen - wie z.B. die ZDFneo Zeichentrickserie ""Deutsches Fleisch"", Gags schreiben für Extra 3 oder Einkäufe erledigen für alte Menschen (ihr glaubt nicht, was man da verdient!).
Aber eigentlich will ich nur meine Kunst machen. Unzensiert, roh und ehrlich. Das gelingt mir immer besser, aber leicht ist es nicht. Man muss ja doch Miete zahlen (und laufende Unterhaltskosten für die ständig hungrigen Ausrutscher einer EINZIGEN Nacht... ICH HASSE DICH, VERA! DU HAST MICH REINGELEGT!)
Jetzt habe ich dieses Buch geschrieben. Also genauer gesagt, schreibe ich es gerade noch fertig. Geht ja heute: Dinge verkaufen, bevor es sie gibt. Früher nannte man das Betrug. Heute Crowdfunding. 
""Snickers für Linkshänder - Das Buch"" ist eine Kurzgeschichtensammlung voller absurder Alltagssituationen, teils real, teils Phantasie, teils unerhört übertrieben, teils so dermaßen echt, wie nur unsere verrückte Welt sein kann. Wer damit jetzt so GAR NICHTS anfangen kann, wird am Ende dieses Textes eine kleine Auswahl vorfinden.Ja, das Buch ist etwas teurer als ein Paperback im Buchhandel. Das liegt daran, dass ich weder eine Agentur, noch einen Verlag im Rücken habe und alles (vom Schreiben, über Layout bis zum Vertrieb) komplett in Eigenregie mache. Nur Lesen müsst ihr es schon selbst. Ich habe viel Mühe und Liebe in diese Texte gesteckt und freue mich darüber, sie nun endlich mit der Welt zu teilen. Zusätzlich gibt es in dieser Kampagne ein paar weitere ""Kunstprodukte"" von mir. Der Erlös fliesst zu 99% in meine Kunst rein. 1% gehen für Zigaretten und Monte drauf.Danke für Deine Unterstützung!Und viel Spaß weiterhin auf meinem geliebten Portal: https://www.facebook.com/snicklink/Willy

Das biete ich an:
Snickers für Linkshänder - Das Buch

Der fresheste Shit von hier bis Honolulu in einer limitierten Edition. Die besten Kurzgeschichten von meiner Seite plus fünf EXKLUSIVE Texte, die bisher nur ein verwahrloster Puppenspieler namens Giovanni lesen durfte. Inklusive 35 wunderschöner Bildcollagen, die ich mit einer gecrackten Version von Photoshop erstellte. Gönn Dir!




   


(Die Abbildung ist nicht 100% deckungsgleich mit dem Endprodukt, weil es noch kein einziges gedrucktes Exemplar gibt. Es wird ein Paperback im schwarz-weiss-Druck sein, ca. 135 Seiten)
Meine zwei Klassiker ""Berlin Fucking City I & II"" als Neuauflage. Bissige Berichte eines jungen Wilden über eine Stadt, die ihre Seele verkauft - garniert mit Wut, Hass und Humor.Die Originalauflage wird zurzeit (I kid you NOT!) zu HORRENDEN Preisen - und zwar GEBRAUCHT - gehandelt:

                   


Snicklink T-Shirt


Ein geheimes Abkommen mit JEDEM Club der Welt erlaubt es Dir mit diesem T-Shirt auf jede noch so begehrte Veranstaltung - durch bloßes Tragen - am Pöbel vorbei und KOSTENLOS reinzukommen. Außerdem ist es ein global akzeptierter Indikator dafür, dass du reich und erfolgreich bist und über gesunde, leistungsfähige Genitalien verfügst. Der Rechtsweg ist ausgeschlossen.

<h3>Thanks to some offline donations I am currently at the $350 mark! OVER HALFWAY THERE!! Thank you to everyone who's chipped in so far.</h3>
<h3>About my goal:</h3>
<p>My name is Jessica, and I'm a writer from Houston, Texas.  Over the last year, I've received some extremely positive feedback on my writing from several agents and editors and have used that feedback to improve the novel I've been working on since November 2008, MOST WANTED, a young adult sci-fi/fantasy novel.</p>
<p>I learned that 16 agents who represent my age group/genre, will be accepting pitches at the DFW Writers' Conference May 19 and 20.  The ability to pitch to 16 in one weekend is huge.  There have been many success stories to come out of this conference, and I hope to be one more!</p>
<p>I hadn't planned to attend any other conferences for a while because of finances.  It's been tough over the last couple of years with student loans, extensive medical bills, and periods of both unemployment and underemployment (like right now).  However, when I saw how many of my top agent choices would be there, I knew I had to get there somehow.  In addition to the opportunity to pitch, there will be some fantastic classes that I'm looking forward to attending.</p>
<p>You can read about the conference here: <a href=""http://dfwwritersconference.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://dfwwritersconference.org/</a></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Where you come in, if you're willing!</h3>
<p>Here's a breakdown of the $600 I'm trying to raise:</p>
<p>$350 is for the registration fee (includes a full weekend of workshops on the craft and business of writing as well as one formal pitch session with an agent and lunch both days)</p>
<p>$250 is to cover the hotel costs for two nights ($99/night plus tax)</p>
<p>Additional costs not included above that will be covered if funding exceeds my goal:  I'm fortunate to have a ride there and back, so I'll only need to chip in for gas.  Based on how high gas has been, this may be pricey.  I'll also have to take care of my meals other than lunch.  If I'm able to, I'd love to have an additional formal pitch session, which would be $39.</p>
<h3>What I can give in return:</h3>
<p>Even if an agent offered representation at the conference, I'd most likely have to go through some revisions to MOST WANTED before we'd go on submission to the publishing houses.  Then it would take at least a year before the book debuted.  So, my gifts are mostly based on things I can give soon or things I think people would get a kick out of!  I'm offering several levels of perks depending on your donation amount.  Please see the sidebar for the gifts at each level.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The impact of your donation:</h3>
</div>
<div>I have always loved to write.  It took me a long time to trust the voice inside me that told me I could do it.  I wrote the roughdraft of MOST WANTED in November 2008 and have revised it over and over, trying to polish it into a diamond.  Along the way, I helped start a local writing group that just had its 2-year anniversary and became involved in a national, online writing organization.  One of my short stories has been published in an anthology, and another will be published this year.  Each conference or workshop I've attended has improved my writing, and I've had some incredible opportunities to learn from published authors, editors, and agents along the way.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I've made the connections that will help me promote my work, now I just need the agent who is as passionate as I am about my characters.  With sixteen agents who represent Young Adult novels, the odds of getting a request for my material are really good.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>At a recent conference I attended, both the editor and agent I had critiques with praised my writing and my voice.  That has given me the confidence to know it's time to send this novel out into the world.  With your help, I'll be one step closer.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute financially (and I completely understand or I wouldn't be asking for help!), please help me spread the word! I appreciate the time you've taken to read this.  Thank you for helping me along my writing path.</p>

<p>La Galería is the place in which family, neighbors, and guests gather to discuss everything from the latest chisme to social and political issues. It is the place where dialogue and debate are welcomed and encouraged. Similarly to la mecedora, galerías are not exclusive to a particular class; some are built-in, others are an impromptu creation. </p> <p><strong>Why We Need Your Support</strong></p>
<p>La Galería does not receive any government or corporate funding. We are committed to staying independent and write opinion pieces that are anti-oppressive and that continue connecting the diaspora without any filters or compromises. We are committed to this, but to become a project that can maximize impact, we need your help!</p> <p><strong>We need your help to sustain us! </strong>We need to pay for website support and maintenance, hosting, coding, and protection for our website, and we’d like to be covered for at least 5 years. According to NJ Creatives, “the lowest rate for hourly design rates is $40, and the highest is $75 (although I know freelance web designers that charge $100 an hour), with an average of $59 an hour.” You can read more about website design rates here: <a href=""http://executionists.com/much-website-cost-2015/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://executionists.com/much-website-cost-2015/</a></p> <p><strong>We need to pay our writers! </strong>We would like to compensate those who write for us in a time when writers of color aren't highlighted, are often underpaid, and are not compensated for their work. We want to hire reporters to cover events, protests and community projects; issues that are important to our community. We are also in need of translators for some of our most impactful writings that were either submitted in English or Spanish. The rates for how much we’d pay will depend on how much money we raise (so the more we raise, the more we can pay), according to an infographic created by Clear Voice, writers get paid as little as .05 cents per word (which equals $30 for a piece with the minimum required 600 words), to an average of .35 per word. Additionally, we would like to pay community photographers to take photos that can accompany these articles. </p> <p><strong>We want to go to print! </strong> Currently we're working on gathering some of our best and most read articles to put out the first edition. We also have goals to develop an anthology of Dominican writers and some stories of the Diaspora from a non-fiction, historical lens. This is especially important when looking at the need to document people's diasporic experience and some of the historical context and movements happening in the U.S. The Dominican Diaspora has done an incredible amount of work, and we need to showcase that. We want to document stories of survival as well as resistance that is far from the mainstream and that show a counter-narrative for future generations. Beyond a digital platform, we are hoping to document our legacy in print. </p>
<p><strong>We want to become more accessible! </strong>The magazine is currently online which inevitably makes us inaccessible to many people in our communities. Our current demographics include mostly millennials, but we’d like to reach folks of all ages and stages in life.</p> <p><i>Imagine how cool it would be to see this on your block:</i></p>

La Galería Magazine's mission is to provide content that encourages dialogue, celebrates the community, and inspires action among Dominicans of the Diaspora. Our magazine documents and celebrates the stories of the Dominican Diaspora. Articles on our site have touched on topics that directly affect our community including blackness, feminism, the trauma of immigration, LGBTQ issues, food, history, love, sex, and a large array of short poems and creative stories.  La Galería Magazine understands that our stories and perceptions are different, and that only through dialogue can we begin to respect and understand one another. 
Although we only have a little over a year of being in existence, we have already published  109 articles, gotten over 90,000 views, and held five free community oriented events. We have a community of supporters who often send us positive feedback, comment on our articles, and use the writings on La Galería Magazine for class and community organizing purposes.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>I run an after school programme called <b>Treehut Art School</b>.  Each day i teach 10 children different things from Art, Sewing, Craft, knitting, leadership, Money, Drama, and cooking. They have designed their own radio station, written and acted out their own plays, made videos and designed their own monthly e-zine.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Our new project is to cook our way to a perfect cook book for children. This means trying out recipes or coming up with new recipes. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The children in my programme learn how to be creative thinkers. Mistakes are learning curves and there is nothing they cant achieve. The children in my classes range from 5 to 12 years. They all work together and inspire each other. </p>
<p>Each year we set a goal. The children talk through what they want to do and we look at all the options. This year we are putting a Cookbook together.</p>
<p>With every project we do, we also GIVE BACK and this year the children have decided to give back to JAPAN. So half of the money will go to Japan and the other half gets divided up between the children for their savings accounts.</p>
<p>Each child has a long term goal that they are saving for i.e. University, A house,or to travel around the world.</p>

<h3>Samuel's Story - The Long and Winding Road</h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.voiceinamillion.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/medina-Tangier.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 5px;""/>In the early hours of the morning of the 2nd November 2005, a small bundle wrapped in a white blanket was left in a doorway at the rear of the fish market, in the old city quarter of Tangier. Nobody saw who left it and nobody took any notice. As the market came to life and the streets started to bustle with locals, somebody was inquisitive enough to take a look.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Wrapped inside the blanket was a small child, just a few days, possibly a couple of weeks old. With no visible signs of a mother or anyone taking care of the child, the local police were called and the child was taken to the local Kordobi Hospital.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">One week later, and seemingly none the worse for his ordeal, this unknown child was<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.voiceinamillion.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/tanger-creche.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 5px;""/> taken into care by the Creche at the hospital, where he joined around 50 other children in a similar plight. With no papers and no known identity, the young boy was given a name by the staff of the creche. They called him Achraf and gave him a surname ‘Halim’.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">A little more than three months later, a British couple (Robert and Jo Garofalo) were visiting the Creche. Laying in his cot in a room with around twenty other babies, they met Achraf for the first time; and from that moment there was an unbreakable bond between them.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.voiceinamillion.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sam-in-creche-with-jo.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 5px;""/>A bond that was to become the nucleus of a struggle against bureaucracy for almost a year; and a roller coaster ride on a bumpy, long and winding road.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 60px;""><em><strong>This little foundling's story entwines Politicians, a King, a Prime Minister, Rock Stars, Religion; and above all, a struggle against a system which would, had it not been for the couple’s tenacity, have seen this young boy remain in care</strong></em>.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Six years later, with his broken past long behind him, Samuel, fully aware of his background, is a bright young vibrant boy growing up and going to school in the leafy suburbs of Surrey; and his story has already touched the lives of tens of thousands of children and tens of thousands of adults across the UK.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">In 2009, Samuel's parents launched Voice in a Million. A children's choir that perform to raise awareness of children less fortunate than themselves; children like Samuel, that need a loving family to take care of them.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Since the launch the choir has grown from 32 members, to more than 26,000; and<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.voiceinamillion.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/VIAM-02-arena.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 5px;""/> they have performed at some of the largest venues in the UK including selling out the O2 Arena and Wembley and in 2013 will be coming to the USA. </p>

<h3>The reason for the Superkid Tour</h3>
</div>
<div>I grew up in Cambridge (Hespeler!), Ontario Canada. There were few black families in Cambridge and I loved to read. I read everything from Judy Blume to Beverly Cleary to E. B. White. What was missing in the stories was a little black girl. A mischievous, playful young girl who just wanted to have fun.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I am the writer of the novel Introducing Sophia Firecracker. It is the story of a nine-year-old girl who thinks she's a superhero. When Principal Corncob hints that teacher Mrs. Greenbean may also be a superhero, Sophia sets out on a mission to discover the teacher's superpowers.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I wrote Introducing Sophia Firecracker so that a generation of young girls and boys will have a positive image of themselves. Sophia is a character that makes kids laugh and hopefully, instills a sense of pride and self-esteem.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>To this day, there is a lack of diversity in children's books; hence the need for the Superkid Tour. Sophia Firecracker is my implement for change and I want to introduce her to as many children as possible.</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<div>
<h3>What We Need  </h3>
<p>The Superkid Tour needs $5000 to buy as many books as possible and put gas in the car. The goal is to giveaway 3000 books across the United States and Canada.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>From UNO to Yoko...</h3>
<p>All the perks are on the right. The Five-Oh-Oh-Horsechack! buys books for an entire classroom of kids, the Triple-Play helps two kids and the Century Club helps ten.</p>
<p>Whatever you can do helps.</p>
<p>If you have a special request, I will do my best to accommodate. Please feel free to ask!</p>
<p>I understand that not everyone is able to contribute. Thanks for reading down this far anyway! You can also help to spread the word by linking out the campaign to your social media network and friends.  </p>
<p>                                                                                                    With thanks;<br/>                                       A. A. Riley (hey, you can call me Angie, we're friends now!)</p>
<p><em>NOTE</em>: I'm on the flexible plan on Indiegogo so all funds go to support the tour.</p>

<p><strong>RAVES for Introducing Sophia Firecracker!!!<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>...(I) read the intro on your website and thought it was written brilliantly - the sprouts girl made me laugh!<br/>best wishes for both you and your book,<br/>                                                                            -Cheryl -from email </strong></p>

<p> </p></div>","The reason for the Superkid Tour

I grew up in Cambridge (Hespeler!), Ontario Canada. There were few black families in Cambridge and I loved to read. I read everything from Judy Blume to Beverly Cleary to E. B. White. What was missing in the stories was a little black girl. A mischievous, playful young girl who just wanted to have fun.
 
I am the writer of the novel Introducing Sophia Firecracker. It is the story of a nine-year-old girl who thinks she's a superhero. When Principal Corncob hints that teacher Mrs. Greenbean may also be a superhero, Sophia sets out on a mission to discover the teacher's superpowers.
 
I wrote Introducing Sophia Firecracker so that a generation of young girls and boys will have a positive image of themselves. Sophia is a character that makes kids laugh and hopefully, instills a sense of pride and self-esteem.
 
 
To this day, there is a lack of diversity in children's books; hence the need for the Superkid Tour. Sophia Firecracker is my implement for change and I want to introduce her to as many children as possible.

 

What We Need  
The Superkid Tour needs $5000 to buy as many books as possible and put gas in the car. The goal is to giveaway 3000 books across the United States and Canada.
 
From UNO to Yoko...
All the perks are on the right. The Five-Oh-Oh-Horsechack! buys books for an entire classroom of kids, the Triple-Play helps two kids and the Century Club helps ten.
Whatever you can do helps.
If you have a special request, I will do my best to accommodate. Please feel free to ask!
I understand that not everyone is able to contribute. Thanks for reading down this far anyway! You can also help to spread the word by linking out the campaign to your social media network and friends.  
                                                                                                    With thanks;                                       A. A. Riley (hey, you can call me Angie, we're friends now!)
NOTE: I'm on the flexible plan on Indiegogo so all funds go to support the tour.

<p></p><h2>
<u style=""font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">WELCOME TO MY INDIEGOGO CAMPAIGN</u><br/>
</h2><p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">My name is Jolene Lavine and I currently make my home in Vancouver, WA, though I am a California native. I was born and raised in Sacramento and eventually moved to Folsom, CA. Yes, where the prison is.  While in Folsom, my husband, Jesse, and I built a beautiful life with our daughters, Jessica and Jocelyn.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">On April 29, 2010, heaven sent a hurricane in the form of the Traumatic Brain Injury our eldest daughter, Jessica, sustained while preparing for her weekly horseback riding lesson. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">As we navigated emergency rooms, surgeries, medical procedures and information we never would have imagined we needed to know, I took advantage of the world of Social Media to keep our family and friends updated. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">My desire to document our story wasn’t a burst of light or flash of insight. It was simply habit. Something I’d been doing online for 11 years at the time. Writing about what was happening to our family seemed like the natural thing to do. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Facebook, Livejournal and the message boards I am a part of made it easy to reach all of those in our Circle. I didn’t have to make dozens of phone calls that would have torn me apart by having to repeat the story, over and over and over again. With the Internet, I could write one message and send it to hundreds of people and know it would generate the Light and healing we needed. I’ve said more than once: The Internet saved my sanity.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">When I decided to make the jump from writing about our experience online to publishing a novel, it wasn't because I thought “This is what I should do.”, but more the culmination of dozens of voices telling me: “This is what you <b>have</b> to do.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">In living our new reality, I found my grief and heartache could no longer be contained in a Facebook status box or online journal entry. Having the monumental task of producing a
novel seemed like a good idea. I hoped sharing the beauty of our story, of hope and miracles and the awesomeness that is my kid would prove to be cathartic. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I was inspired to write by the fight in Jessica, the fight in me and by the fight in all of the people pulling for our family. By the waves of energy that surrounded us from the very beginning, making miracles happen.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">So, I suppose in that way, I was inspired by The Light after all.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Today, I sit, pulling together the final pieces of our story. It has been a long, arduous process, filled with excitement, misery, anger and hope. I have set this project aside many times, simply overwhelmed with the challenge of capturing the beauty of our story into 200 or so pages.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The journey has been made easier by the people who have asked me how it's going and by my focus group that has stood by me loyally, providing great feedback and cheer-leading. I have also belonged to six different writing groups, consulted three different writing coaches and have changed my vision a dozen times.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Now, it’s time for me to turn to you again. Our family and friends, acquaintances, and strangers across the world.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I hope you find something on my list of incentives that will entice you to help carry me through the final stage of this journey. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Your generous contributions will help fund the editing of the final draft, a new <a href=""http://www.jolenelavine.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">jolenelavine.com</a> website, ISBN numbers, barcodes, cover design for the print books, as well as for the e-books and audio books, the interior book design, printing of the books, press kits and mailings, as well as the dreaded processing fees and shipping costs.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">If together we can successfully meet this goal, I will be able to have the E-Book available by the fourth anniversary of Jessica’s accident (April 29, 2014), with print copies available shortly after.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Thank you for reading, highest love,
brightest blessings, and, as always, Viva La Jessica. Let us all, once again: Guide Her Home.</span></p>
<br/><h3></h3><p><u><b>STRETCH GOALS</b></u></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Any funds raised over the stated goal will help with the overhaul of the Viva La Jessica website, which hasn't been updated in over three years. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">If generosity exceeds those levels, we will be able to start planning book launches in Vancouver, WA and Folsom, CA. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Contributions beyond that will go to further promotion and print runs of the book.</span></p>
<br/><h3></h3><p><u><b>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</b></u></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The biggest risk is that I haven’t actually . . . you know . . . um . . . <i>finished</i> writing the book. Writing is the only other thing I am working on, beside this campaign. The fingers are flying and I project I will have everything submitted to my editor by the end of January, Mid-February at the latest.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">All other risks can be listed under the category of “Life”. This is my part- full- and double-time job for the next six months, at least. Writing, and publishing this book is my big goal for the anniversary of Jessica’s accident this year. The things that
would get in my way would be illness, family illness, and other unexpected
emergencies we are unable to plan for.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Thank you for your support. Gratitude rising.</span></p>

WELCOME TO MY INDIEGOGO CAMPAIGN

My name is Jolene Lavine and I currently make my home in Vancouver, WA, though I am a California native. I was born and raised in Sacramento and eventually moved to Folsom, CA. Yes, where the prison is.  While in Folsom, my husband, Jesse, and I built a beautiful life with our daughters, Jessica and Jocelyn.
On April 29, 2010, heaven sent a hurricane in the form of the Traumatic Brain Injury our eldest daughter, Jessica, sustained while preparing for her weekly horseback riding lesson. 
As we navigated emergency rooms, surgeries, medical procedures and information we never would have imagined we needed to know, I took advantage of the world of Social Media to keep our family and friends updated. 
My desire to document our story wasn’t a burst of light or flash of insight. It was simply habit. Something I’d been doing online for 11 years at the time. Writing about what was happening to our family seemed like the natural thing to do. 
Facebook, Livejournal and the message boards I am a part of made it easy to reach all of those in our Circle. I didn’t have to make dozens of phone calls that would have torn me apart by having to repeat the story, over and over and over again. With the Internet, I could write one message and send it to hundreds of people and know it would generate the Light and healing we needed. I’ve said more than once: The Internet saved my sanity.
When I decided to make the jump from writing about our experience online to publishing a novel, it wasn't because I thought “This is what I should do.”, but more the culmination of dozens of voices telling me: “This is what you have to do.
In living our new reality, I found my grief and heartache could no longer be contained in a Facebook status box or online journal entry. Having the monumental task of producing a
novel seemed like a good idea. I hoped sharing the beauty of our story, of hope and miracles and the awesomeness that is my kid would prove to be cathartic. 
I was inspired to write by the fight in Jessica, the fight in me and by the fight in all of the people pulling for our family. By the waves of energy that surrounded us from the very beginning, making miracles happen.
So, I suppose in that way, I was inspired by The Light after all.
Today, I sit, pulling together the final pieces of our story. It has been a long, arduous process, filled with excitement, misery, anger and hope. I have set this project aside many times, simply overwhelmed with the challenge of capturing the beauty of our story into 200 or so pages.
The journey has been made easier by the people who have asked me how it's going and by my focus group that has stood by me loyally, providing great feedback and cheer-leading. I have also belonged to six different writing groups, consulted three different writing coaches and have changed my vision a dozen times.
Now, it’s time for me to turn to you again. Our family and friends, acquaintances, and strangers across the world.
I hope you find something on my list of incentives that will entice you to help carry me through the final stage of this journey. 
Your generous contributions will help fund the editing of the final draft, a new jolenelavine.com website, ISBN numbers, barcodes, cover design for the print books, as well as for the e-books and audio books, the interior book design, printing of the books, press kits and mailings, as well as the dreaded processing fees and shipping costs.
If together we can successfully meet this goal, I will be able to have the E-Book available by the fourth anniversary of Jessica’s accident (April 29, 2014), with print copies available shortly after.
Thank you for reading, highest love,
brightest blessings, and, as always, Viva La Jessica. Let us all, once again: Guide Her Home.
STRETCH GOALS
Any funds raised over the stated goal will help with the overhaul of the Viva La Jessica website, which hasn't been updated in over three years. 
If generosity exceeds those levels, we will be able to start planning book launches in Vancouver, WA and Folsom, CA. 
Contributions beyond that will go to further promotion and print runs of the book.
RISKS AND CHALLENGES
The biggest risk is that I haven’t actually . . . you know . . . um . . . finished writing the book. Writing is the only other thing I am working on, beside this campaign. The fingers are flying and I project I will have everything submitted to my editor by the end of January, Mid-February at the latest.
All other risks can be listed under the category of “Life”. This is my part- full- and double-time job for the next six months, at least. Writing, and publishing this book is my big goal for the anniversary of Jessica’s accident this year. The things that
would get in my way would be illness, family illness, and other unexpected
emergencies we are unable to plan for.
Thank you for your support. Gratitude rising.

</h3><p>Hi! My name is
Kevin Wood and I’m turning to you with help to finance a book project, entitled
<b>THE BOARD</b> which has already created
attention among the international arts and music community. I’ve been in the
arts world a long time, over 35 years, with some of the major record companies
such as BMG and Sony but also as head of cultural organizations around the
world. I also teach, part-time, at two universities here in Europe and think
this book is something that will help young and upcoming arts managers and
students or arts management as well as members of boards of directors in the
USA. Originally in two parts, a print version and an audio book, the classical
record label, Claudio Records in the UK, had committed its impressive resources
to record and to represent the audio book through its worldwide distribution
network and Naxos. We have recorded the audio version and the packaging and
funding for that portion of this project is now in place. In this second phase,
I need to turn my attention to the printed version of <b>THE BOARD</b>. The publishing company, Deutsche
Wissenschafts-Verlag/German University Press in Germany, has committed to the
publication and international distribution. However, to make this all possible,
we still need to raise the sum of €5000. We need this amount to pay for the
printing of the book as well as for some marketing above and beyond what the
publisher will provide. That’s why I am turning to you.<span>  Let me describe a bit about what <b>THE BOARD </b>is all about and why it was
written. </span></p>
<p>In writing <b>THE
BOARD</b>, I have done so with the aim of giving to students of arts
management, to those sitting on other boards of directors and to musicians, the
arts public and to those who associate themselves with such cultural
organizations, a set of guidelines whose purpose is to help to alert them to
the signs of dry-rot and to the serious ethical pr0blems that may exist in
their own organizations. The purpose of this narrative is not to frighten or
dissuade anyone from joining the Board of Directors of an arts institution or
from entering into a management position with such a smaller organization.
There are many such non-profit entities which are governed ethically and which
hold true to a high standard of behavior, dedicated to their communities and to
the improvement of the quality of life in their regions. On these boards are
often to be found individuals who, with creativity, energy and generosity, give
of themselves for the good of the arts and culture in their region. These
persons are to be praised for what they contribute society and to quality of
life.</p>
<p>However, there are other organizations such as I have
described in <b>THE BOARD</b> where these
concerns become nothing but a footnote, where governance and a despotic and
controlling board of directors evidences disregard for the consequences of
their refusal to properly steward their institution. These consequences can be,
and often are, dramatic for the employees and for the community and can lead to
the eventual dissolution of the organization through a slow but irreversible
process of decay. We have seen this in the recent economic crisis that has
caused insufferable pain for millions. Such crises exist in the arts as well
and the story of <b>THE BOARD</b> mirrors
the gravity of what has taken place during this period in our history in our
broader, world-wide community. <b>THE BOARD
</b>hopes to show you the symptoms of such decay and pleads for an ethical
balance and better control of such organizations for the good of the people, of
the employees of such organizations, and of their community.<span>  </span></p>
<p>The risks in now raising the hoped-for goal of €5000 will
mean that I must find a way to release the work at my own expense which I will
do via a loan or other means. With the support of the audio book version being
underwritten by some important funders and by the recording company, itself, I have
great hope the book version finds acceptance from your side. </p>
<p>Please watch the short video and consider helping by
sponsoring this project if you can. The subject is timely and is not only about
music and the arts but about parts of our lives that deal with our security,
our families and our careers, issues important to us all. </p>
<p>Some of you will be unable to contribute. If you
cannot, but are convinced that this is a subject that may also be of interest
to you and others, please tell your friends, share the links with them and
remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools. Many thanks for all your help and
 your support in this project!</p>

<br/><h3>The Confines of the Shadow</h3> <p></p>
<i>The Confines of the Shadow</i> is a sequence of novels and short stories that map the transformation of the Libyan city of Benghazi from a sleepy Ottoman backwater in the 1910s to the second capital of an oil-rich kingdom in the 1960s. Alessandro Spina's saga begins in November 1912 with <i>The Young Maronite</i>, which sees Italian soldiers solidifying their control over Libya's coasts, leaving Libyan rebels to withdraw to the desert and prepare for a war that would last until 1931, when by dint of sheer brutality, including the internment of tens of thousands of civilians into concentration camps, the Italians crushed the rebellion and murdered its widely respected leader, Omar al-Mukhtar. Employing a cosmopolitan array of characters, ranging from Ottoman functionaries, to Sanussi aristocrats and Italian officers, Spina chronicles Italy's colonial experience from the euphoria of conquest - giving us a front row seat to the rise and subsequent fall of Fascism in the aftermath of World War II - to the country's independence in the 1950s. Spina finally concludes his narrative with the discovery of Libya's vast oil and gas reserves, which triggered the tumultuous changes that led to Muammar Gaddafi's forty-two year dictatorship.<p></p> </div><div><br/></div><div>*****************************************************************************<br/>

The Confines of the Shadow 
The Confines of the Shadow is a sequence of novels and short stories that map the transformation of the Libyan city of Benghazi from a sleepy Ottoman backwater in the 1910s to the second capital of an oil-rich kingdom in the 1960s. Alessandro Spina's saga begins in November 1912 with The Young Maronite, which sees Italian soldiers solidifying their control over Libya's coasts, leaving Libyan rebels to withdraw to the desert and prepare for a war that would last until 1931, when by dint of sheer brutality, including the internment of tens of thousands of civilians into concentration camps, the Italians crushed the rebellion and murdered its widely respected leader, Omar al-Mukhtar. Employing a cosmopolitan array of characters, ranging from Ottoman functionaries, to Sanussi aristocrats and Italian officers, Spina chronicles Italy's colonial experience from the euphoria of conquest - giving us a front row seat to the rise and subsequent fall of Fascism in the aftermath of World War II - to the country's independence in the 1950s. Spina finally concludes his narrative with the discovery of Libya's vast oil and gas reserves, which triggered the tumultuous changes that led to Muammar Gaddafi's forty-two year dictatorship. *****************************************************************************

The Nation published André Naffis-Sahely's essay 'Spina's Shadow' in their August 18-25 issue. Banipal also featured the essay on their website to help promote our fundraising effort: Who is Alessandro Spina?
*****************************************************************************
  What We Need: Darf Publishers are seeking additional funding to help pay for the translation of the remaining two volumes of The Confines of the Shadow, which in its entirety runs to 1300 pages. Darf Publishers have already committed to issuing the first installment of this three-volume translation, and Volume 1 will include the novels The Young Maronite, The Marriage of Omar and The Nocturnal Visitor, which are set between 1912 and 1927. Volume 1 will be published in February 2015, and we hope to issue Volumes 2 and 3 in 2016 and 2017.

*****************************************************************************

Darf Publishers commissioned the South African artist Morné Visagie to produce a cover for The Confines of the Shadow. This is his description of the photograph:
In the 1700’s two exiles on Robben Island, the one being a Khoi man, and the other a Dutch Sailor, were romantically involved. After ten years they were sentenced to death on charges of homosexuality. ""On 19 August 1735 the two men had weights tied to their bodies, and somewhere between the Cape and Robben Island were dropped into the ocean to drown, a death no doubt designed to cleanse the earth of their polluting presence” (Nigel Penn 1992). This photograph was taken in 2010, half way between Robben Island, where I grew up, and the Cape Town harbour.
Morné will also produce a limited edition series of prints of his photograph, which are available for sale here.

For brief historical perspectives, see our short video displayed above.
Why Is Helping & Boosting the Advancement of Neuroendocrine-Immunology Research Important?

There still exists a large cultural and knowledge divide between neuroscience and immunology.
Immunology-related research often implies a cell-centric, reductionistic approach.
Concepts discussed at BrainImmune represent the most recent advances in the field; they are not available in medical textbooks, and, as a general rule, not taught at medical schools.
MOST IMPORTANTLY – this field has important clinical implications (see below).



The Stress-Immunity Link
Solid evidence indicates that all immune functions are affected, in a significant fashion, by the major stress hormones. Importantly, most, if not all major human diseases - their onset, development and course - are affected by acute (short) and/or long- term chronic stress.

BrainImmune is the first site covering stress-immune interactions with over 120 articles in this area. For more details and examples from the BrainImmune Site - see our video displayed above, or visit the Site at: http://www.brainimmune.com/
Major Clinical Implications

An increasing body of evidence also indicates that a neurohormonal- or neuroendocrine-immune dysfunction plays a major role in several human diseases.

<p>       Like most people I
got happily caught in the vortex of Warren when I came up from New York, saw
Glass Menagerie at the Edgcomb barn, got stinko, and before you know it, I’m living in a
van in Neal Harrington’s driveway for the summer and doing a play with Phantom.
The van was followed by Steve Badanes’ trailer and glass outhouse and 15 years
of encouragement and support from Phantom Theater and its audiences where I
brought two of my plays, ‘Sally on the Mount’ and ‘Je Regrette Tout!’ as well
as performed in Phantom productions. Much of my book, <i>Fiction Ruined My Family</i>, began in readings at Phantom before going
on to 'This American Life', publication by Riverhead Books in 2011 and HBO. (For
more info and to read other work, visit jeannedarst.com.)</p>
<p>      I have wanted to write a book about Warren for years.
Warren and the entire Mad River Valley is a beautiful area, the architecture is
aggressively progressive but it is the <i>people </i>of Warren and Prickly Mountain
that I fell for. There exists a certain spirit
which, for me, is made up of a few things:  a keen sense of humor, a
love of nature, food, drink, performance, intellectual curiosity, kindness and
hospitality, a certain wildness, a need to create, a sense of adventure and doing
things for the hell of it (a quality that is completely dying in the world at
large) and finally and most important, people in Warren know how to have fun, often hard-won, sometimes baffling,
competitive, frequently death-defying, but unmistakable fun. It is only
recently that I realized I shouldn’t wait to write this book.</p>
<p>        My goal, as I said in the video, is to get these stories down in
recorded audio interviews this summer<b>, Prickly’s 50<sup>th</sup> Anniversary
basheroo,</b> and put together a proposal comprised of a sample chapter or two by
the end of the summer to submit to a publisher. </p>
<p>         Please contribute if you can and pass this indigogo link on to
anyone you think might want to support this book about Warren. </p>

It’s through Sara’s story and friendship that Hope learns to open her heart to others.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<h3><strong>BECOMING HOPE: THE STORY</strong></h3>
<p><span>When seventeen-year-old Hope Taylor is caught distributing her church’s anti-Semitic literature at school she is given the choice between community service and a three-day suspension. The last thing Hope needs before final exams is another time out from school. Besides, what can be so hard about spending four weekends reading to a nearly blind old lady?  </span></p>
<p><span>Hope is stunned when she discovers that the old lady she has to read to is a Jewish woman from Poland. Not only is she Jewish, but Agnes claims she’s a holocaust survivor and spent a year in the Auschwitz concentration camp - both events Hope believes are exaggerated, if not outright lies. Since Hope has no choice but to stay, she begins to read to Agnes. </span></p>
<p><span>The book Agnes has chosen for Hope to read is a diary Agnes kept during her year in Auschwitz.  When Hope interrogates the old woman about the authenticity of her experiences during the holocaust, she discovers how tough and wise Agnes is.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope continues reading the diary to Agnes during their sessions, and even sneaks it out to read on her own. The true tales Agnes weaves in the book draw Hope deep into the dark world of Auschwitz and the camp section restricted to women where Agnes recounts personal confrontations with Joseph Mengele. As Hope continues reading to Agnes, the woman’s courage and honesty dissolve Hope’s racial prejudices and help the young woman learn to be tolerant of others.</span></p>
<p><span>Agnes’ diary in 'becoming Hope' is based on an actual book called </span><span>Auschwitz: True Tales From A Grotesque Land, </span><span>written by Sara Nomberg-Przytyk, the mother of a very good friend of mine, and published by The University of North Carolina Press. Sara’s son Jerzy and Vicky Wells, the director of contracts and subsidiary rights at the UNC Press, have given me their support and permission to use Sara’s book as a storytelling device that includes using excerpts in ‘becoming Hope’. They are also interested in an idea I pitched on creating a new version of </span><span>Auschwitz: True Tales From A Grotesque Land for the young adult and educational market.</span></p>

<h3>
<span><strong>BECOMING HOPE: THE BOOK &amp; PROJECT</strong></span> </h3>
<p><span><strong>becoming Hope</strong> is a book first and foremost, but there is more attached to it than just words and a story. It’s about what a book and its story and characters can inspire. How it can spark change, question beliefs, and open up minds and hearts. By supporting the creation, publication, and distribution of <strong><em>becoming Hope, </em></strong>you might be contributing to the making of a bestseller. Of course it all still depends on me delivering a well written story, but I do have good editors and advisors to help.</span></p>
<p><span>With <strong><em>becoming Hope,</em></strong> I want to create an ongoing dialogue by producing and distributing a study guide; a website where we can market and promote the book, related information, reading guides, content for educators, and an interactive forum. I will develop a revised school and student version of Sara Nomberg-Przytyk’s original book, Auschwitz: True Tales From A Grotesque Land, to present to the University of North Carolina Press, the book’s publishers. The UNC Press are aware of the project to create a combined book and reading guide, and are willing to review it for publication, or co-publication.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span><strong>HOW BECOMING HOPE GOT STARTED</strong></span></h3>
<p><span>A few years ago I learned that a good friend of mine’s mother, Sara Nomberg-Przytyk, had written a book about her experience as a prisoner in Auschwitz.</span><span> I borrowed the book from my friend Jerzy Przytyk, Sara’s son, and finished it in two days; breathless, exhausted, and inspired from what I had read. </span></p>
<p><span>It was a powerful and well told story that contained events and information about that place and time in history that I had never been aware of. All of it told from the point of view of Jerzy’s mother, a young Jewish Polish woman named Sara. I asked Jerzy if I could adapt the book into a story that I could tell through film or stage, and he graciously agreed. </span></p>
<p><span>But I soon discovered that the excitement and inspiration I got from the book didn’t help me translate the book and Sara's story into an easily made movie. It took some time until a good idea bubbled up. I went off in one direction for awhile but got stuck trying to tell the story from too many points of view. So the idea and story lingered while I tried to think my way to a solution. But thinking analytically is often a creativity killer. </span> </p>
<p><span>Then, a few weeks ago, I heard an interview with a young woman from the southern United States who turned away from a life and church that discriminated against Jews and Gays. This change was sparked by a friendship the young woman made with a Jewish man started through a dialogue on Twitter, 140 characters at a time. This triggered a new idea.</span></p>
<p><span>I remembered that a very good friend of mine told me how she had spent a summer reading the English translation of Sara’s book to her for proofreading, much like ghe fictional Hope does. My friend told me how spending that intimate time with Sara had brought the two of them closer. The light went off! </span></p>
<p><span>I could use my friend’s experience as a spark to ignite <strong>'<em>becoming Hope'</em></strong>, and shape it into a compelling, fictional, young adult story. This could be a book I would be proud to write, and show friends and family. A story to inspire others and open hearts. And it was a great way to tell people about Sara, her book, and experience surviving Auschwitz and the Holocaust -- all through the eyes of seventeen year old Hope Taylor. </span></p>

<p>This year, I have the official honor of live-blogging the <a href=""https://metaintegral.org/events/integral-theory-conference-2013"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>2013 bi-annual Integral Theory Conference: Connecting the Integral Kosmopolitan</strong></a>. With the philosopher Roy Bhaskar and the integral thinker Edgar Morin (author of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Homeland-Earth-Manifesto-Millennium-Complexity/dp/1572732482/ref=la_B001HOFRSI_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370564190&amp;sr=1-3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Homeland Earth</a>) as plenary speakers, it's bound to be a thought-provoking event.</p>
<p>This year's theme – connecting the <em>Integral Kosmopolitan</em> – is a significant step for integral thinking, calling for those who recognize integral as, ""a multiple object... trans-lineage"" and ""meta-disciplinary"" to participate.</p>
<p>I've always considered myself a<em> trans-lineage advocate</em>, having early on begun with the works of Ken Wilber, but moving just as readily into the tremendous tomes of Jean Gebser, Sri Aurobindo, Teilhard de Chardin, and other integral thinkers like William Irwin Thompson.</p>
<p>When Mark Forman asked me to be this year’s official blogger, I was elated. “Sure!” I said.</p>
<p>But then there’s the whole issue of <em>getting</em> there.</p>
<p>This is where you come in.</p>
<p><img alt=""EL Banner"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://evolutionarylandscapes.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/cropped-el-final.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""EL Banner""/></p>
<p><img alt=""Evolutionary Landscapes"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/9QbGQrz.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""EL""/></p>
<p>My blog<em>, <a href=""http://www.evolutionarylandscapes.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Evolutionary Landscapes</a>,</em> is a labor of love. Put succinctly,<em> EL</em> is an alternative media platform for spiritual activism and a crossroad for divergent communities attempting to understand our planetary age. To cover this year's conference in the San Francisco Bay area, I'll be paying out of pocket to fly over to the West Coast from my current, muggy location in Titusville Florida (the Space Coast, by any other name).</p>
<p>I write because I believe there is deep significance in drawing together an emergent culture of integral and evolutionary thinkers, multiple disciplines like integral theory and liberation theology, medieval studies and cyborg anthropology. In this remixed, combinatorial age, we need multiple contexts. Synthesis is emergent. To make it <em>possible</em> to meet, greet, and blog my heart out for ITC, offering my careful consideration of the presenters and teachers there, I will need your financial support.</p>
<p>We all <em>carry </em>each other. Events can be supported, writers funded, communities built, all through the wonders of crowd-sourcing. It would be an honor to be<em> carried</em> by integral-oriented folks of all shapes and sizes: conference presenters, fellow attendees, fans of<em> EL</em>, and most of all, my readers. I ask you only to offer with you can, and I'll step forward with the mighty... well, keyboard, and my thoughts on the page.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>What your fundraising will do:</h2>
<p><img alt=""ITC's Location "" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://metaintegral.org/sites/default/files/San_Francisco_Airport_Marriott.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""ITC 2013""/></p>
<p>Your ITC Blogger making it to the conference! The biggest hurdle is <em>getting</em> there and back again. The round-trip flight, by itself costs $450. As a recent college graduate, on the hunt for full-time work, this is simply not possible to do on my own.</p>
<p>I've set the minimum to <em>$500, as this will greatly help make the trip financially possible.</em></p>
<p>Now, once I'm there, I'll be covering everything. That is, as <em>much</em> as my fingers can type and my brain can digest each day. I will be attending as many panels as I temporally can (and if you have anything that can extend my writing abilities through time and space, that'd be great).</p>
<p>In addition to live-blogging <em>each</em> day's amazing events (both in the conference rooms and as Mark Forman says, the ""<a href=""https://foundation.metaintegral.org/itc/blog/conference-hallways"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">conference in the hallways</a>."" Yes, there are bound to be some interesting trans-lineage conversations), I'll be doing...</p>
<ul>
<li>Interviews with panelists and attendees. </li>
<li>Recordings, and transcripts of conversations to be published on <em>Evolutionary Landscapes</em> once I return home. </li>
</ul>
<h2>
<strong><em>Additional</em></strong><strong> funds will, with much appreciation, go to EL:</strong>
</h2>
<ul>
<li>Basic site maintenance, domain name renewal</li>
<li>Website improvements! Improved themes, website hosting upgrades, and most importantly...</li>
<li>
<strong>More</strong> content! Your patronage makes EL's content possible. More articles. More interviews, podcasts. If there's sufficient support, it would be<em> lovely</em> to expand EL's content curation into e-books. The more time I can put into it, the more it will grow (if you build it, they will come...)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h2><strong>What do you get back?</strong></h2>
<p>Aside from me blogging ITC 2013? You make my craft possible. You improve <em>Evolutionary Landscapes</em> as an alternative media platform for spiritual activism and cultural investigation. You fund what I'm doing, as a labor of love and passionate scholarly pursuit. But I'd like to invite you to also reach out to me. Let's Skype.</p>
<p>I encourage fundraisers to reach out to me and let me know what <em>you</em> are doing. Before and after the conference (I'll probably still be soaring days after getting home), I'd be delighted to share my findings and experiences with you. The people I'll meet. The ideas conveyed. The possibilities opened.</p>
<p>I'll share what I know and tell what I've seen. Most importantly, I encourage more collaboration. If you've got something you'd like to do. A writing project, an idea to explore on EL, or simply friendly integral correspondence, let’s do it!</p>
<p>A deep bow of gratitude to you. Hope to see you at ITC 2013!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Other Ways to Support:</h2>
<p>The economy is rough these days. So, even if you can't or don't want to support funding this project financially, please consider spreading the word. Let others know about this page. Share it with friends and colleagues. </p>
<h2>Some Big Updates!</h2>
<p>So, in 4 days, I reached my initial goal (and the minimum funding requirement of IndieGoGo) of $500. I can't say how appreciative and graced I am by your enthusiasm and support for my campaign! Seriously, thank you. As of me writing this, there are still two weeks left - 14 days - before the campaign closes. I've continued to receive donations from some wonderful folks, and as mentioned, additional funding goes to a) meals b) transportation while in SF Bay, and c) my blog's site maintanence and upgrades (more storage, better themes, more podcasts, interviews and content). Through your support, it's possible Evolutionary Landscapes might grow by leaps and bounds. Any contributions at this point are simply grace, in my eyes. So if you feel like contributing, or want to continue to support this campaign in some way, please share this page with friends and colleagues, conference attendees and panelists, or simply readers who might be interested in the content of my blog (consciousness studies, cultural evolution, counter-cultural literature and spiritual activism). Thank you again!</p>

I write because I believe there is deep significance in drawing together an emergent culture of integral and evolutionary thinkers, multiple disciplines like integral theory and liberation theology, medieval studies and cyborg anthropology. In this remixed, combinatorial age, we need multiple contexts. Synthesis is emergent. To make it possible to meet, greet, and blog my heart out for ITC, offering my careful consideration of the presenters and teachers there, I will need your financial support.
We all carry each other. Events can be supported, writers funded, communities built, all through the wonders of crowd-sourcing. It would be an honor to be carried by integral-oriented folks of all shapes and sizes: conference presenters, fellow attendees, fans of EL, and most of all, my readers. I ask you only to offer with you can, and I'll step forward with the mighty... well, keyboard, and my thoughts on the page.


What your fundraising will do:

Your ITC Blogger making it to the conference! The biggest hurdle is getting there and back again. The round-trip flight, by itself costs $450. As a recent college graduate, on the hunt for full-time work, this is simply not possible to do on my own.
I've set the minimum to $500, as this will greatly help make the trip financially possible.
Now, once I'm there, I'll be covering everything. That is, as much as my fingers can type and my brain can digest each day. I will be attending as many panels as I temporally can (and if you have anything that can extend my writing abilities through time and space, that'd be great).
In addition to live-blogging each day's amazing events (both in the conference rooms and as Mark Forman says, the ""conference in the hallways."" Yes, there are bound to be some interesting trans-lineage conversations), I'll be doing...

Interviews with panelists and attendees. 
Recordings, and transcripts of conversations to be published on Evolutionary Landscapes once I return home. 


Additional funds will, with much appreciation, go to EL:


Basic site maintenance, domain name renewal
Website improvements! Improved themes, website hosting upgrades, and most importantly...

More content! Your patronage makes EL's content possible. More articles. More interviews, podcasts. If there's sufficient support, it would be lovely to expand EL's content curation into e-books. The more time I can put into it, the more it will grow (if you build it, they will come...)



What do you get back?
Aside from me blogging ITC 2013? You make my craft possible. You improve Evolutionary Landscapes as an alternative media platform for spiritual activism and cultural investigation. You fund what I'm doing, as a labor of love and passionate scholarly pursuit. But I'd like to invite you to also reach out to me. Let's Skype.
I encourage fundraisers to reach out to me and let me know what you are doing. Before and after the conference (I'll probably still be soaring days after getting home), I'd be delighted to share my findings and experiences with you. The people I'll meet. The ideas conveyed. The possibilities opened.
I'll share what I know and tell what I've seen. Most importantly, I encourage more collaboration. If you've got something you'd like to do. A writing project, an idea to explore on EL, or simply friendly integral correspondence, let’s do it!
A deep bow of gratitude to you. Hope to see you at ITC 2013!


Other Ways to Support:
The economy is rough these days. So, even if you can't or don't want to support funding this project financially, please consider spreading the word. Let others know about this page. Share it with friends and colleagues. 
Some Big Updates!
So, in 4 days, I reached my initial goal (and the minimum funding requirement of IndieGoGo) of $500. I can't say how appreciative and graced I am by your enthusiasm and support for my campaign! Seriously, thank you. As of me writing this, there are still two weeks left - 14 days - before the campaign closes. I've continued to receive donations from some wonderful folks, and as mentioned, additional funding goes to a) meals b) transportation while in SF Bay, and c) my blog's site maintanence and upgrades (more storage, better themes, more podcasts, interviews and content). Through your support, it's possible Evolutionary Landscapes might grow by leaps and bounds. Any contributions at this point are simply grace, in my eyes. So if you feel like contributing, or want to continue to support this campaign in some way, please share this page with friends and colleagues, conference attendees and panelists, or simply readers who might be interested in the content of my blog (consciousness studies, cultural evolution, counter-cultural literature and spiritual activism). Thank you again!",3.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<p>Help us provide solar-powered mp3 players loaded with Bible stories to the Datooga people.</p>
<h3>Reaching the Datooga</h3>
<p>Storytelling is an important part of the Datooga culture and telling Bible stories is a strategy our missionary friends, the Haskins, already use to share the Word. However, the Haskins are the only Christians ministering to these people and there are only 2 other saved people in the village.   "". . . the harvest is plentiful but the workers are few"" Matthew 9:37</p>
<p>After a visit from Forrest, Kirk started thinking about ways to make the stories more available. We found a way to use technology to increase ""the workers"" using a solar-powered mp3 player that hangs around the the neck.  It enables each individual to have a collection of stories, in their language, they can listen to again and again.  The lack of computers ensures the data we download will not be replaced.  It is solar powered so works in the primitive circumstances. The people already wear spirit pouches as necklaces, so would be an easy adaptation to switch to Holy Spirit pouches.  In the picture above, the lady on the left is wearing a spirit pouch.</p>
<h3>Groundbreaking Strategy</h3>
<p>This is a revolutionary method for sharing the Bible with unreached peoples.  Lack of basics in Third World areas, like computers and electricity, have prohibited implementation of many strategies we take for granted in the United States.  With these devices, we can cheaply connect the Datooga with the Word in their own language.</p>
<h3><strong>Who are we?</strong></h3>
<p>Kirk and Renee McCarty.  We are a couple who have been passionate about missions for many years.  In fact, we fell in love on a short-term mission trip and continued to make trips as a married couple.  About 6 years ago, Renee's physical problems prohibited any more trips, but we have continued to be involved with support and prayer.</p>
<p>Our partners in this strategy are Forrest and Purity Haskins and their children Riley and Crystal.  They are a missionary family we have known and supported for approximately 7 years.  They are a part of the African Inland Mission (AIM) agency.</p>
<p>We have been impressed with their dedication, willingness to be obedient and enthusiasm.  Forrest and Purity's desire to follow the Lord's leading resulted in their living with the Datooga (Dah-toe-ga) people and working to find ways to reach them for Christ.</p>
<h2>What We Need</h2>
<p>Our goal is $2,500.  With that amount we would be able to purchase an mp3 player for every adult and older child in the village.</p>
<p>The players cost approximately $20 each, plus shipping.  We may be able to get a discount for purchasing 100+, which would simply allow us to purchase more players.  This money will only be used to purchase mp3 players.  We will use any funds collected to buy the maximun amount of players, even if we don't reach our goal.</p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Have you heard the story... ""You’ve got to go to school so that you can learn..."" Then.. ""You’ve got to make good grades so that you can get into a good college... so that you can get a degree... so that you can get a good job... so that you can make good money... and afford a nice house and car.. so that you can have a family and a dog.. and eventually have a 'good life.'""?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Well, I was about half way down the wide and heavily traveled path to ""the good life,"" when I began meeting people who had followed this map all the way to the end, of whom many seemed to be asking,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>""Where is the part where I get to the place I was trying to go?""</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At this point, I wasn’t experiencing 'what I was doing' to be directly complementing the 'good life' and I began to ask where exactly is it that I’m trying to get, with all this?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And on top of it, school had become my guide to what was important to learn in life, church was my map to salvation, pop trends and movies were my guide to how to act if I want to connect with others, money for security, and so many others were the maps that I had been hoping would lead me to the place I was trying to go; the place, that when I get there, I know there is nowhere else I want to be. But in ""how to get there on my own, from wherever I happen to be sitting..."" I sat in darkness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All I knew was that when I surfed, in that moment, I needed nothing else to finally enjoy living, nothing else to feel free; at peace. Only to share that feeling with everybody else... and it didn’t sound like a bad place to be. But of course, I knew I couldn’t live on a surfboard... food, water, shelter, hygiene, and the rest of the conditions of existence wouldn’t allow for it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>That is when the question that started this whole journey began.</p>
<p>""What is it about surfing that I can’t seem to get from the rest of my life?""</p>
<p> </p>
<p> So I began studying psychology and the state described as ""Flow"" by athletes in peak experiences. Then Philosophy where I developed a strong interest in researching all the scriptures, indigenous cultural beliefs, eastern and western philosophies, other contexts, and all the sciences where truths about reality were being revealed -which seemed to mirror the way I experienced reality when I surfed and also as was described in texts describing the mystical experience. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>And then the Journey began, where I now stand, in Sweden, where all the research, the Journey, the traveling and writing condenses into this book.</p>
<p><strong><em>-From the Map Back to the Territory </em></strong>or simply<strong><em>   -Back to the Territory</em></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>And this is the Project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Where I will be sharing a book I hope will offer insight into what keeps us from living our lives in this place all the time and the implications of -the description of reality during the mystical state reflecting truths revealed in various new fields of science. (of which our common experiences often do not seem to be very representative of)</p>
<p> </p>

Your funds are just as important as is the very things Im writing on. Your impact is monumental, and every single contribution shows me someone connects with what its about and that they think it is worth the journey.

Thank you for stopping by! My name is Ruika Lin. I'm a 24-year-old from Sichuan, China currently working and living in San Francisco, CA, USA. I'm running this crowdfunding campaign to self publish an essay collection, along with several guest writers, to explore the Questions we ask in our lives. The funds raised through this campaign will help editing, designing, and marketing the book.













The title of the book is Frequently Asked Questions.
The essays are non-fictional short stories about questions we ask ourselves and each other, on our thoughts, identities, experiences, dreams, directions, interaction with people and environment around us, and perception of the world.




WRITERS:






Ruika Lin - Leaving home of 18 years on the other side of the planet, Ruika came to the United States in 2007 to attend the University of Virginia. Beyond the life-changing college experience at a southern public school, Ruika strives to keep a balance among different layers of her identity that she picks up along the journey as she continues to explore new environment, cultures, and human behaviors in the US and abroad. When she's not attempting to figure out how the world works, she immerses herself in the endless pleasure of music making, great conversations, writing, and homemade omelet.David Abramovich, Guest Writer - David is a Russian-born human, for whom, like for Ruika, English came second. The world lacks answers, so the questions he asks are multifold. Expect a mix of ""Nancy Drew"" and ""House of Leaves"". Steven Boren, Guest Writer - *Born: Yes *Raised: Ultimate Red State Package (Utah-Idaho-LDS add ons) *School: Some, then some more... those time are all a blur of fog *Married: Really? No one is that Crazy *Kids: See section Married *Pets: Cassidy the Boonie Dog and Amelia the Tabby Cat. RIP *Profession: Musician (failed); Writer (I wrote this so failed); The Stuff I can't talk about (retired) *Hobbies: I write Pop tunes for no good reason *Places I've lived: Stanley, Idaho; Provo, Utah; Rock Springs, Wyoming; Saipan, CNMI *Home: San Francisco *Dreams: Answer is in my EssayKyle Lamson, Guest Writer - Like Ruika, Kyle also attended Mr. Jefferson's University. Instead of staying up all night at Clemons Library pondering concepts like
existence, identity, and ontology, he spent his years in the
mechanical engineering lab wondering why his problem set calculations never
added up. It's amazing that even The Declaration, the jealous, underfunded step-sister of the school's principle
paper, ever published anything he authored given his English education clearly
stopped at some point in late high school. Kyle lives in San Francisco where he
writes about romance, coexistence with techne, and the economization of our
irrational lives. Check out two articles he wrote for The Declaration: Being There and Get Off Our Tax.
Malika Noel, Guest Writer - 
A legal aid attorney and ""J.D.
Distinguished Fellow"", Malika is committed to social justice and a world
with a little more heart. She considers herself in good company with all the
weirdos who think outside of the box and dare to change the world. In her free
time, she enjoys flexing her self-proclaimed poet skills and trying to live in
the now. She's excited to be part of this thought provoking project and invites

Several chapters in the book, including the excerpt below, are inspired by essays I wrote in Chinese over the past few years, two of which will be included in the book. Whether you read Chinese or not, each language is a form of beauty, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to share with you.

<p>Europe’s startup scene is booming, but one key factor of a developed startup scene is missing: a dedicated print media reciting our story and telling the world where we’re going.

<p>I’m launching this campaign to fund the last leg of research for my first nonfiction book, <em>Scent and Subversion: A Century of Provocative Perfume,</em> which will be published next fall by Lyons Press.</p>
<p>In <em>Scent and Subversion</em> (which I have almost completed writing!), I will look at 20th century perfume as a medium that reflects on — and often rebels against — conventional attitudes about gender, sexuality, and the body. <em>Scent and Subversion</em> will feature reviews of over 300 vintage perfumes spanning the 20<sup>th</sup> century; it will be illustrated with over 100 20<sup>th</sup> century vintage perfume ads; and it will feature guides to perfume appreciation and interviews with visionary perfumers of the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>
<p><strong>“Perfumery, a hundred-year-old art, has taken a long time dying, but on January 1, 2010 it will be officially dead. “ – Luca Turin regarding the International Fragrance Association’s ban on classic perfume ingredients</strong></p>
<p>Of the 300+ perfumes I discuss in <em>Scent and Subversion</em>, some have been discontinued, some have been reformulated because certain ingredients are now banned, and in other cases, some have just vanished, like pulp novels with only one print run. Because all perfume will eventually evaporate, it's been important to me to delve into as many 20<sup>th</sup> century perfumes as I can get my hands (and nose) on before they all disappear.</p>
<p><strong>“My newest favorite perfume blog is Yesterday’s Perfume, where</strong> <strong>Barbara Herman</strong> <strong>explores our collective cultural history as embodied in fragrance.”</strong> – Katie Puckrik, journalist, broadcaster, perfume blogger</p>
<p>Before I fell in love with perfume and began blogging about it four years ago on yesterdaysperfume.com, I was the editor of a women’s pop culture website TrèsSugar.com in San Francisco, and for years I was a grad student at UC Berkeley’s Department of Rhetoric and Film. Perfume seems to me just as worthy of attention as films or books, and even though its production, history and aesthetics have been written about extensively, what feels missing to me is a cultural and particularly feminist approach to analyzing perfume. Perfume, after all, has primarily been made for and marketed to women.</p>
<p>This has been an expensive project to curate, however, and I’m asking you to help me on this last leg of my olfactory journey into the past.</p>
<p> <strong>WHAT YOUR CONTRIBUTION WILL HELP FUND:</strong></p>
<p> •  I’m trying to cover around 30 vintage perfumes per 20<sup>th</sup> century decade, and there are a number of perfumes, mainly in the form of sample decants, that I still need to purchase. (I estimate the cost at around $500)</p>
<p> • Because I want vintage perfume ads to help readers visualize perfume’s otherwise invisible rhetoric, I’ve amassed quite a collection of vintage perfume ads.  I still have many to purchase, however — around $500 worth.</p>
<p> •  The biggest cost I’m asking you to help me to defray is the cost of a roundtrip ticket to Europe to interview perfumers and scent historians in France and Germany, and to visit the Osmothèque perfume museum at Versailles. The Osmothèque is a repository of the rarest perfumes I could not smell otherwise. (The total for that trip will be around $4000 for flight, budget lodging, and other costs.)</p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOU'LL GET FOR CONTRIBUTING:</strong></p>
<p>In addition to knowing that you have aided a perfume lover in her desire to share her knowledge of rapidly disappearing icons of 20<sup>th</sup> century perfumery, you will receive the following fragrant gifts as thanks: vintage perfume-scented, hand-written thank you notes; sample vials of vintage perfume; high-res frameable copies of beautiful vintage perfume ads; totebags decorated with vintage ads; signed copies of my book; and your name in the book’s acknowledgements section.</p>

And remember, every higher-level pledge includes the awards from lower levels, like the ebook and/or a paperback copy.</p>
<p><strong>A Character Named for You! </strong>It's true, mom named me after Gregory Peck, but what if it was the other way around? What if a character with <em><strong>your</strong></em> name became internationally famous, like John Rambo? For this pledge, I’ll make you famous forever (hey, once it’s in the Library of Congress, it’s in the<img alt=""John Rambo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/602941/pictures/original/20130103092336-John_Rambo.jpg?1357233819"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 5px;""/> pages of history!). Pledge a little more than this award level—yes, you can do that!—and you’ll get a bigger character named for you. After all, you’d rather be the President’s Chief of Staff than an admin assistant, right? Remember, to get this specific award, you have to request this award, but you can pledge any dollar amount higher than the minimum. And remember, when Margaret Atwood did the same thing on her $94,000 <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/fanado/x/1433385"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Fanado campaign"">Fanado Indiegogo campaign</a>, this award cost her fans $10,000.

And if my campaign is successful, I hope to have books for sale at this conference!</p>

<h2><strong>The Nitty Gritty: What We Need</strong></h2>
<p>Let’s be clear<strong>:</strong> unlike some campaigns, I’m not asking you to fund my time to write a novel—hey, I’ve got skin in this game! My novel’s already written. In fact, <strong><em>The Cupola Collusion</em></strong> represents five years of effort to become a professional—and damn good!—novelist. That’s my donation to this campaign (well, that and a few thousand dollars already spent that you’ll see below).</p>
<p>Now what I need to do next is to turn this 400-page manuscript pile into a <img alt=""Books and a Kindle"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/580543/pictures/original/20121213133016-books_and_Kindle.jpg?1355434224"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 5px;""/>real book—one you can hold in your hands, just like that last John Grisham you took to the beach—or in your Kindle (or Nook). That small step, however, involves several people with more expertise in their respective fields than me.</p>
<p>Here’s the breakdown, in ascending order of when the funds you pledge get spent by me:</p>
<ul>
<li>A professional thriller editor has quoted me $3,000 for a full manuscript edit and a line edit. Ouch! I have already paid, however, for a developmental edit—you’re off the hook on that one!—which is why my novel is already well polished.</li>

<li>Stock photos for marketing—the video you watched above has several—at prices averaging ten bucks apiece. That'll run at least $200.</li>
<li>Formatting the manuscript to ePub file format and P.O.D.

How many of you have uttered Martin Luther King’s famous words: “I have a dream!”? Maybe it’s jumping out of a plane, maybe it’s winning Dancing With the Stars… or maybe it’s writing that great American novel. And not just a novel—a thriller! A thriller that takes a regular guy—like you and me—pits him against overwhelming odds, watches him succeed, and fail... and ultimately succeed. Or does he? That’s a thriller—it’s fiction that keeps you turning pages far into the night!
That’s why I wrote The Cupola Collusion!
How much do I love writing? So much that I’ve written four high-concept political thrillers—that’s over five years of my life writing full time—all to nurture my dream into reality. I’m a good novelist now—Robert Ludlum’s agent represented me, in fact—but only recently has technology and the marketplace allowed novices like me to self-publish a book that proves the same quality as the last John Grisham book you bought.

<p>On the fifth anniversary of our bookstore we decided to host an Authors Fair. It was such a success that we held it again for the 6th anniversary. It was easily twice the size of the first one and was extended to two days with panels being done the night before by some of the authors. This was well received and we plan on keeping that going each year.</p>
<p>The Author's Fair is now an annual tradition held each year during the anniversary of our store. This is where we need your help. Our anniversary happens to be in March and we are located in southern Indiana. Both of the past two years we have been inbetween snow or rain storms.</p>
<p>During this year's event we had 36 authors attend. we would like to increase this to 50 for this coming up year. We also had an animal adoption fair and had lots of dogs adopted out to good homes. We are hoping they will be back next year with more dogs and we are alooking for some other charities that would like to come and setup also.</p>
</div>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To help enlarge the authors fair for this next year we need to make sure we have tents that everyone can sit under and tables to support them all. This will allow us to have more authors for you to mee. Not to mention with the Authors FAir taking place during March in southern Indiana we are always worried about rain or worse SNOW! This will make it so no matter what the weather we will have a nice event.</p>
<p>The majority of the funding we need is to go for Tents to cover the parking lot in front of our building and the one beside us. We have at least an 80 X 80 area we can cover with tents. The more we are able to buy the more authors we will be able to host.</p>
<p>After the tents we need more tables to use. Several of the authors this past year brought there own tables. This worked but we would like to be able to provide the tables for them. That way they can bring more of their books for you to enjoy.</p>
Depending on what your contributions are we have a number of perks for you including signed books from the authors and special signed posters with signatures from all the attending authors and musicians.</div>

<p><strong>Bio je ponedjeljak, 20. siječnja 2003. godine. </strong></p>
<p>Predsjednik Mesić je održao prijem za novinare, na HRT-u je išao Hit Depo, Ćiro Blažević je pripremao svoj Varteks za proljetni dio 1. HNL, ljudi su hrlili u kina pogledati drugi dio trilogije Gospodar prstenova, a cijena benzina narasla je za 3,3% pa je za litru Eurosupera trebalo izdvojiti vrtoglavih 6,63 kn. U Čakovcu je grupa mladih alternativaca/ki osnovala udrugu besmislenog imena, Akciju za civilnu transparentnost - ACT. Ostalo je povijest. Jedna od najaktivnijih organizacija civilnog društva u sjeverozapadnoj Hrvatskoj kasnije mijenja ime u Autonomni centar - ACT, a u kolovozu 2016. godine pripaja se <a href=""http://act-grupa.hr"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ACT Grupi</a>. <br/><br/>Kroz gotovo 15 godina djelovanja, ACT Grupa je (su)osnovala <strong>12 organizacija civilnog društva i društvenih poduzeća</strong>, <strong>7 regionalnih i nacionalnih</strong> (prvenstveno zagovaračkih)<strong> mreža</strong> te inicirala i pomagala u razvoju više stotina neprofitnih organizacija. Provedeno je više od <strong>140 projekata</strong> s više od <strong>450 partnerskih organizacija</strong>.

<h3>Pomozi izdavanje knjige!</h3>Predstoji nam još dosta posla - autor <strong>Robert Posavec</strong> marljivo je proteklih mjeseci radio na istraživanju (nesređenog) arhivskog gradiva i dokumentacije, razgovarao s brojim akterima (sadašnjim i bivšim zaposlenicima/ama, volonterima/kama, partnerima i suradnicima, korisnicima/ama, donatorima i donosiocima odluka...) i još nekoliko mjeseci mu je potrebno da sve sintetizira u štivo koje će se čitati i proučavati sa zanimanjem. Nakon toga slijedi prijelom, dizajn i tisak, distribucija... Knjigu planiramo <strong>završiti i objaviti do travnja 2018. godine</strong>. <br/><br/>Cijeli projekt košta oko 110.000 kuna (knjiga će biti tiskana na recikliranom papiru, imati tvrdi uvez, naslovnicu u boji, više od 200 stranica teksta...). Iz vlastitih izvora osigurali smo gotovo polovicu iznosa, a da bismo zatvorili financijsku konstrukciju <strong>potrebno nam je još oko 60.000 kuna</strong>, za dizajn i tisak.

Da priča o našem iskustvu može biti inspirativna i korisna drugima. Da se dobro dobrim vraća.

<h3>Po čemu je knjiga posebna?</h3>
<p>""Ovo nije knjiga koja govori o fantastičnim ljudima koji su bez greške došli do fenomenalnog uspjeha. Ne, ovo knjiga koja govori o tome da se kroz tisuću i jednu grešku, na mjesečnoj razini, došlo do toga što je danas prepoznato kao dobro i kao model koji vrijedi replicirati"", kaže Robert. <br/><br/>Knjiga na više od 200 stranica u 16 poglavlja obrađuje sljedeće teme i otvorena pitanja:</p>
<p>Na koji su način punk pokret i uradi sam kultura stvorili vrijednosti koje su i danas temelj ACT Grupe. Kolektivizam. Konsenzus. Zašto se javila potreba za strukturiranjem aktivizma te je li ta promjena dobra ili loša u kontekstu društvenog utjecaja. Konkretni primjeri uz analizu akcija i projekata.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508923237/osu2vzlj3dcvixrrijhm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Infoshop Tabula Rasa</strong>. Današnja je knjižnica <a href=""http://tabularasa.hr"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tabula Rasa</a> započela s radom kao rupa od 12 kvadrata s frižiderom i naslonjačem u kojoj su spavali aktivisti iz cijelog svijeta. Pokrenuti su prvi rezidencijalni programi nezavisne kulture u sjeverozapadnoj Hrvatskoj. Prva umrežavanja infoshopa, razmjene knjiga, digitalizacija dijela nezavisne scene. Početak financiranja donacijama i prvi financirani projekti. Specijalizacija prema financiranju projekata i zašto je knjižnica stala s razvojem kad su krenuli projekti. Čije potrebe ona danas zadovoljava, ako zadovoljava.</p>
<p><strong>Klub mladih</strong>. Poslovni model temeljen na solidarnoj ekonomiji i sivoj ekonomiji. Fluidna organizacijska struktura. Je li klub zaista bio odgovor na potrebe zajednice ili tek na vlastite potrebe. Prvi festivali nezavisne kulture. Prve razmjene programa na razini Hrvatske. Prvi besplatni neformalni specijalistički programi obrazovanja. Koncept razmjene vještina. Organizacijsko i programsko usmjeravanje prema act.klubu i act.inku.</p>
<p><strong>Slobodni festival</strong>. Hacklab 2.0. Inovacija, transdiciplinarnost, zajednica. Slobodna kultura. Utjecaj. ACT. Pripitomljavanje i sređivanje vlastitih života. Donacije, fondacije, projekti. Plaće! Vizije i njihova realizacija. Utjecaj na zajednicu i pojedince.</p>
<p><strong>Program JAKO</strong>. Civilno društvo sjeverne Hrvatske. Prije pokretanja <a href=""http://programjako.info"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Programa JAKO</a> i danas. Kakav je utjecaj Program imao, kako ga mjeriti?</p>
<p><strong>ACT Printlab</strong>. Model samozapošljavanja kao odgovor na potrebe civilnog društva. Razvoj poduzeća. Širenje. Nova zapošljavanja. Podrška organizacijama civilnog društva. Raspodjela dobiti. Utjecaj na razvoj društvenog poduzetništva. Druga tržišta i prilike za razvoj do kojeg ne dolazi. Uloge direktora zaposlenika.</p>
<p><strong>ACT Konto</strong>. Zaposlenice su vlasnice. Zašto taj model nije funkcionirao. Kako se uspješno održava status quo i kako politika jednakih plaća poništava rizike i napredak.</p>
<p><strong>Humana Nova</strong>. Socijalno zadrugarstvo. Radna integracija. Vlastiti prihodi. Poticaji i olakšice. Promocija proizvoda. Lajkovi na društvenim mrežama ne donose prihode. Radnici – vlasnici/ zadrugari. Udruge – vlasnici/zadruge. Zašto takav model ne funkcionira i nije poticajan. Kako je dolazilo do skaliranja i replikacije modela koji nije model te zašto javnost to vidi kao model. Država kao jamac statusa quo.</p>
<p><strong>Volonterski centar Međimurja</strong>. Kako je Ana došla volontirati u ACT, zaposlila se, pokrenula volonterski ured te koja je uloga volonterskog centra. Organizacijsko strukturiranje. Usmjerenost prema van i unutra. Upravljanje.</p>
<p><strong>CEDRA Čakovec</strong>. Društveno poduzetništvo i zadrugarstvo u praksi. Načela i vrijednosti. Studija slučaja. Što zadrugu čini zadrugom.</p>
<p><strong>ACT Press</strong>. Upravljanje, odgovornosti, kontrola. Prodaja. Distribucija. Solidarnost. Kako se ne posluje. Studija slučaja.</p>
<p><strong>Domači vrt</strong>. Što poduzećima donose strateška i poslovna planiranja i zašto ponekad ne donesu ništa. Zapošljavanje marginaliziranih skupina u poljoprivredi. Zajednica i lokalne vlasti prema nacionalnim manjinama. Lokalno tržište. Planirani modeli nisu realizirani modeli.</p>
<p><strong>Centar za pomoć u kući Međimurske županije</strong>. Civilno-javno partnerstvo i pružanje socijalnih usluga van formalnog sustava.</p>
<p><strong>ACT Grupa</strong>. Zagovaranje, promocija, javne politike, specifični/jedinstveni konzorcijski oblik, zajednički financijski modeli (cash pooling, fondovi).</p>
<p><strong>Novi pothvati</strong>. Deseci. Stotine novih inovativnih ideja. Bez ljudi. Bez resursa.</p>
<p>Svako je poglavlje zasebna priča sa svojim početkom i krajem. Svako se naredno poglavlje nastavlja na prethodno. Esejističko-publicistički stil s <strong>konkretnim primjerima</strong> u svakom poglavlju. Poseban je naglasak cijele knjige na <strong>organizacijskim modelima</strong>, <strong>modelima financiranja</strong>, <strong>modelima upravljanja i vođenja</strong>, <strong>radu s ljudima</strong>. Svako poglavlje govori o jednoj važnoj točki u razvoju ACT Grupe kao vodećeg primjera društvenog poduzetništva. Primjeri će knjizi dati karakter priručnika iz kojeg se može mnogo naučiti o razvoju organizacija civilnog društva i društvenih poduzeća. </p>

Jedan od ključnih dionika našeg uspjeha i utjecaja si i ti!
Stoga te ovim putem pozivamo da podržiš naš projekt izdavanja knjige o ACT Grupi i njezinih 15 godina djelovanja. Knjiga neće biti samo dokument vremena i spomenar jedne od 55.000 udruga u Hrvatskoj, već i svojevrsni priručnik za razvoj organizacija civilnoga društva, razvoj društvenopoduzetničkih pothvata, priručnik za aktiviranje i djelovanje u lokalnoj zajednici, uspješne zagovaračke modele i drugo.

Pomozi izdavanje knjige!Predstoji nam još dosta posla - autor Robert Posavec marljivo je proteklih mjeseci radio na istraživanju (nesređenog) arhivskog gradiva i dokumentacije, razgovarao s brojim akterima (sadašnjim i bivšim zaposlenicima/ama, volonterima/kama, partnerima i suradnicima, korisnicima/ama, donatorima i donosiocima odluka...) i još nekoliko mjeseci mu je potrebno da sve sintetizira u štivo koje će se čitati i proučavati sa zanimanjem. Nakon toga slijedi prijelom, dizajn i tisak, distribucija... Knjigu planiramo završiti i objaviti do travnja 2018. godine. Cijeli projekt košta oko 110.000 kuna (knjiga će biti tiskana na recikliranom papiru, imati tvrdi uvez, naslovnicu u boji, više od 200 stranica teksta...). Iz vlastitih izvora osigurali smo gotovo polovicu iznosa, a da bismo zatvorili financijsku konstrukciju potrebno nam je još oko 60.000 kuna, za dizajn i tisak. I tu nam je potrebna tvoja pomoć!U znak zahvalnosti pripremili smo ti različite nagrade, odaberi ih u stupcu desno. Osim same knjige ""Punk poduzetnici"" tu su i različiti proizvodi naših članica ACT Printlab i Socijalne zadruge Humana nova, od plakata s grafikom naslovnice autora Bojana Miljančića, zbirke naših raniji izdanja, preko druženja s autorom Robertom Posavcem uz lokalno craft pivo iz Lepi Dečki Brewery,  nama i našim članicama, studijskih posjeta pa sve do edukacija i savjetovanja sukladno potrebama tvoje organizacije. Što ako ne uspijemo prikupiti sav novac?
Mi smo punk poduzetnici/e. Snalazili smo i kada su neki pokušavali sutavno uništiti hrvatsko civilno društvo, preživjet ćemo i ovo. Knjigu ćemo svakako objaviti, samo ćemo morati malo dublje zagrabiti u interne fondove. No vjerujemo u uspjeh, zajednicu, solidarnost. Da priča o našem iskustvu može biti inspirativna i korisna drugima. Da se dobro dobrim vraća. Vjerujemo u tebe. A interne fondove ćemo koristiti za druge razvojne programe i nove (poduzetničke) inicijative. 


Po čemu je knjiga posebna?
""Ovo nije knjiga koja govori o fantastičnim ljudima koji su bez greške došli do fenomenalnog uspjeha. Ne, ovo knjiga koja govori o tome da se kroz tisuću i jednu grešku, na mjesečnoj razini, došlo do toga što je danas prepoznato kao dobro i kao model koji vrijedi replicirati"", kaže Robert. Knjiga na više od 200 stranica u 16 poglavlja obrađuje sljedeće teme i otvorena pitanja:
Na koji su način punk pokret i uradi sam kultura stvorili vrijednosti koje su i danas temelj ACT Grupe. Kolektivizam. Konsenzus. Zašto se javila potreba za strukturiranjem aktivizma te je li ta promjena dobra ili loša u kontekstu društvenog utjecaja. Konkretni primjeri uz analizu akcija i projekata.

Infoshop Tabula Rasa. Današnja je knjižnica Tabula Rasa započela s radom kao rupa od 12 kvadrata s frižiderom i naslonjačem u kojoj su spavali aktivisti iz cijelog svijeta. Pokrenuti su prvi rezidencijalni programi nezavisne kulture u sjeverozapadnoj Hrvatskoj. Prva umrežavanja infoshopa, razmjene knjiga, digitalizacija dijela nezavisne scene. Početak financiranja donacijama i prvi financirani projekti. Specijalizacija prema financiranju projekata i zašto je knjižnica stala s razvojem kad su krenuli projekti. Čije potrebe ona danas zadovoljava, ako zadovoljava.
Klub mladih. Poslovni model temeljen na solidarnoj ekonomiji i sivoj ekonomiji. Fluidna organizacijska struktura. Je li klub zaista bio odgovor na potrebe zajednice ili tek na vlastite potrebe. Prvi festivali nezavisne kulture. Prve razmjene programa na razini Hrvatske. Prvi besplatni neformalni specijalistički programi obrazovanja. Koncept razmjene vještina. Organizacijsko i programsko usmjeravanje prema act.klubu i act.inku.
Slobodni festival. Hacklab 2.0. Inovacija, transdiciplinarnost, zajednica. Slobodna kultura. Utjecaj. ACT. Pripitomljavanje i sređivanje vlastitih života. Donacije, fondacije, projekti. Plaće! Vizije i njihova realizacija. Utjecaj na zajednicu i pojedince.
Program JAKO. Civilno društvo sjeverne Hrvatske. Prije pokretanja Programa JAKO i danas. Kakav je utjecaj Program imao, kako ga mjeriti?
ACT Printlab. Model samozapošljavanja kao odgovor na potrebe civilnog društva. Razvoj poduzeća. Širenje. Nova zapošljavanja. Podrška organizacijama civilnog društva. Raspodjela dobiti. Utjecaj na razvoj društvenog poduzetništva. Druga tržišta i prilike za razvoj do kojeg ne dolazi. Uloge direktora zaposlenika.
ACT Konto. Zaposlenice su vlasnice. Zašto taj model nije funkcionirao. Kako se uspješno održava status quo i kako politika jednakih plaća poništava rizike i napredak.
Humana Nova. Socijalno zadrugarstvo. Radna integracija. Vlastiti prihodi. Poticaji i olakšice. Promocija proizvoda. Lajkovi na društvenim mrežama ne donose prihode. Radnici – vlasnici/ zadrugari. Udruge – vlasnici/zadruge. Zašto takav model ne funkcionira i nije poticajan. Kako je dolazilo do skaliranja i replikacije modela koji nije model te zašto javnost to vidi kao model. Država kao jamac statusa quo.
Volonterski centar Međimurja. Kako je Ana došla volontirati u ACT, zaposlila se, pokrenula volonterski ured te koja je uloga volonterskog centra. Organizacijsko strukturiranje. Usmjerenost prema van i unutra. Upravljanje.
CEDRA Čakovec. Društveno poduzetništvo i zadrugarstvo u praksi. Načela i vrijednosti. Studija slučaja. Što zadrugu čini zadrugom.
ACT Press. Upravljanje, odgovornosti, kontrola. Prodaja. Distribucija. Solidarnost. Kako se ne posluje. Studija slučaja.
Domači vrt. Što poduzećima donose strateška i poslovna planiranja i zašto ponekad ne donesu ništa. Zapošljavanje marginaliziranih skupina u poljoprivredi. Zajednica i lokalne vlasti prema nacionalnim manjinama. Lokalno tržište. Planirani modeli nisu realizirani modeli.
Centar za pomoć u kući Međimurske županije. Civilno-javno partnerstvo i pružanje socijalnih usluga van formalnog sustava.
ACT Grupa. Zagovaranje, promocija, javne politike, specifični/jedinstveni konzorcijski oblik, zajednički financijski modeli (cash pooling, fondovi).
Novi pothvati. Deseci. Stotine novih inovativnih ideja. Bez ljudi. Bez resursa.
Svako je poglavlje zasebna priča sa svojim početkom i krajem. Svako se naredno poglavlje nastavlja na prethodno. Esejističko-publicistički stil s konkretnim primjerima u svakom poglavlju. Poseban je naglasak cijele knjige na organizacijskim modelima, modelima financiranja, modelima upravljanja i vođenja, radu s ljudima. Svako poglavlje govori o jednoj važnoj točki u razvoju ACT Grupe kao vodećeg primjera društvenog poduzetništva. Primjeri će knjizi dati karakter priručnika iz kojeg se može mnogo naučiti o razvoju organizacija civilnog društva i društvenih poduzeća. 
Zaviri u svijet punk poduzetnika ovdje i ovdje!

<br/><p><br/></p>
<p>There were no glowing lights from a cell phone, laptop, or television. Chloe had not looked at a screen for almost an hour and had even turned her alarm clock to the wall so the numbers’ red intensity wouldn’t keep her awake. Afraid the blackout curtains may have been too much, that she had turned her bedroom into a sensory deprivation chamber, Chloe cracked the windows, letting in a bit of night air and music. </p>
<br/><p>She was trying to follow Tanya’s advice and visualize the next day. The technique was supposed to help her regain control of her life and focus on more positive outcomes. Chloe tried to create an image of her brothers letting her have more say in the family business but her mind kept turning to Isaac and the kiss they’d shared earlier. She couldn’t stop thinking about how sweet and intense it was, the way his lips had still been in the shape of hers when she pulled back. Her cheeks warmed and stretched. The silly grin on her face didn’t care that no one could see it. </p>
<br/><p>Maybe if Chloe had not been in complete darkness, reliving her kiss with Isaac, she would’ve seen the fog slipping into her bedroom from one of the windows. The mist was strange, a deep green that was almost black, and it moved with silky purpose toward Chloe, a nightgown across hips. It had no scent but as it reached Chloe in bed, her eyes blinked more slowly. The mist hovered over her, shaping itself like Chloe, wisps of dark green wafting away then reforming, but it had trouble with her face. Chloe’s eyes were closed now, her breathing that of sleep. She couldn’t see the thing’s shifting its diaphanous features repeatedly, unable to change its nothingness into Chloe. Gossamer fingers reached out to Chloe’s face and touched her cheek. </p>
<br/><p>In her dream, Chloe stood in the middle of a street downtown. The streetlamps were dim, buzzing with dying power. She wore a dark green evening gown, a column dress that shimmered in the low light, but she was barefoot. She didn’t recognize anything around her so she began walking, following the yellow line that divides traffic. She wanted Isaac. The need flared in her without warning so she stopped to figure out what was happening. To her right, there was a bookstore. Tanya and Kacey were inside. She gathered her dress so she wouldn’t trip as she ran to them. Her best friends turned to her. Their eyes were too large for their faces, their brown irises now grey and overwhelming the whites. </p>
<br/><p>“Have you seen Isaac,” Chloe began, stumbling back from them. </p>
<br/><p>“No,” they said in unison. “What’s so special about him? Why are you looking for him?” </p>
<br/><p>Chloe backed out of the store as her friends kept speaking as one, asking her over and over why she was looking for Isaac. She ran down the street until she found a police officer. When he turned to her, his eyes were like the others, unnaturally large with very little white to show. </p>
<br/><p>“Please, help me. Something is wrong. I can’t find Isaac.” Chloe didn’t understand what was happening. The officer moved in close and grabbed her wrist. </p>
<br/><p>“He is gone. I’ll take you home,” he said, the teeth in his smile too sharp to be human. He placed his free hand against her neck, pulling her face closer to his. Chloe quickly raised a knee to his groin and he fell, sneering in pain, dark green mist puffing from his mouth like winter cold. </p>
<br/><p>Chloe pulled her dress higher and ran down the middle of the street, calling for Isaac. The dress began to dissipate, ribbons of material leaving stripes across her body before wrapping around her legs and arms, trapping her. She fell to the ground, bruising her cheek, her heartbeat knocking against her tongue. The gown became a cocoon, holding her in place, covering her mouth. Chloe felt a hand on her ankle and looked down. A fog inched over her until a face shifted before her wide, searching eyes. It was Isaac’s face but not. </p>
<br/><p>“You look for me,” the misty face opened its mouth but didn’t shape the words. It was still learning. Its voice sounded like Isaac’s but blended with a second higher voice speaking on a one-second delay. </p>
<br/><p>Chloe shook her head so hard, tears fell from her eyes. This was not the Isaac she knew. </p>
<br/><p>“I am. I am he. You look for me,” the creature sounded angry, its mouth turned down sharply at the corners, an exaggeration of sadness. </p>
<br/><p>“Find me,” the mist said. “You look for me.”</p>
<br/><p>The dark green dress pooled around Chloe, melting, pulling her into the ground. The mist covered her face, repeating, “Find me.”</p>
<br/><p>The bed sheet clung to Chloe’s gasping mouth as she jerked awake in bed. Her alarm clock still faced the wall but its morning alert chimed repeatedly. Chloe sat up and swiped at the sweat on her forehead. She turned the clock to her and dropped her face in her hands, missing the way the red display of light broke through the fog leaving the way it came. </p>

Thursday, 10:56 PM

Chloe backed out of the store as her friends kept speaking as one, asking her over and over why she was looking for Isaac. She ran down the street until she found a police officer. When he turned to her, his eyes were like the others, unnaturally large with very little white to show. 
“Please, help me. Something is wrong. I can’t find Isaac.” Chloe didn’t understand what was happening. The officer moved in close and grabbed her wrist. 
“He is gone. I’ll take you home,” he said, the teeth in his smile too sharp to be human. He placed his free hand against her neck, pulling her face closer to his. Chloe quickly raised a knee to his groin and he fell, sneering in pain, dark green mist puffing from his mouth like winter cold. 
Chloe pulled her dress higher and ran down the middle of the street, calling for Isaac. The dress began to dissipate, ribbons of material leaving stripes across her body before wrapping around her legs and arms, trapping her. She fell to the ground, bruising her cheek, her heartbeat knocking against her tongue. The gown became a cocoon, holding her in place, covering her mouth. Chloe felt a hand on her ankle and looked down. A fog inched over her until a face shifted before her wide, searching eyes. It was Isaac’s face but not. 
“You look for me,” the misty face opened its mouth but didn’t shape the words. It was still learning. Its voice sounded like Isaac’s but blended with a second higher voice speaking on a one-second delay. 
Chloe shook her head so hard, tears fell from her eyes. This was not the Isaac she knew. 
“I am. I am he. You look for me,” the creature sounded angry, its mouth turned down sharply at the corners, an exaggeration of sadness. 
“Find me,” the mist said. “You look for me.”
The dark green dress pooled around Chloe, melting, pulling her into the ground. The mist covered her face, repeating, “Find me.”
The bed sheet clung to Chloe’s gasping mouth as she jerked awake in bed. Her alarm clock still faced the wall but its morning alert chimed repeatedly. Chloe sat up and swiped at the sweat on her forehead. She turned the clock to her and dropped her face in her hands, missing the way the red display of light broke through the fog leaving the way it came.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<i><b>Was ist das Land der Hoffnung</b></i><i><b>?</b></i>
</h1><p><br/></p>
<br/><p>Some years ago, I performed 
as a soloist with the San Francisco Ballet, and during my time backstage
 I took on a huge creative project that lasted nine years - to turn a 
blank square meter piece of fabric into a beautiful landscape using the 
art of needlepainting, or embroidery. The finished piece, pictured 
below, shows a spectacular world where humans and nature lived in 
perfect harmony with one another. I called it Land of Hope, as it 
depicts what I believe the world could be like if we empower ourselves 
and our children to do good. </p><p><i>Während der Zeit, die ich als Solist des San Francisco Ballet hinter der Bühne bei Proben und Warten verbrachte, begann 
 ich ein Projekt, das letztlich neun Jahre dauerte: ich begann ein 
Einquadratmeter großes Stück Stoff lückenlos und mit Reliefs mit sehr 
dünnen Fäden zu besticken. Langsam entstand eine Märchenlandschaft, in 
der Menschen, Tiere und Fabelwesen in Harmonie miteinander und mit der 
Natur leben. So entstand das ""Land der Hoffnung"", von dem ich glaube, 
das es möglich ist, wenn wir und unsere Kindern sich dafür entscheiden.</i></p><p><br/></p><p>After leaving the ballet, my wife 
and I opened our own dance studio in Berlin. Over the years, we have 
watched many of our students grow from small children into beautiful, 
flourishing women and men with strong values of friendship, courage, and
 helpfulness. Inspired by their positive influences in the world, we 
wish to create a multilingual children's story book intended to empower 
even more children to grow as our students did and make the world a 
better place. Our book, based on the Land of Hope tapestry, would use 
close-up images taken from the needlepainting artwork to tell a story of
 how to grow up to be a strong person by encouraging children to respect
 others, have courage, and be helpful, along with many other important 
lessons.</p><p><i>Nachdem
 ich das Ballett verliess, zog ich nach Berlin und schloss mich meiner 
Frau an, die dort ein Tanzstudio betrieb. Im Laufe der Jahre wurden wir 
Zeugen, wie aus kleinen Ballettschülern Erwachsene wurden, die als junge
 Männer und Frauen mit Werten wie Freundschaft, Mut und 
Hilfsbereitschaft lebten. Dies inspirierte mich zu der Idee eines 
Kinderbuches, das eine mehrsprachiges Geschichte erzählt. Und vielleicht
 andere Kinder beeinflusst ebenfalls andere zu respektieren, mutig und 
liebevoll zu sein, und die welt zu einem besseren Platz zu machen. Als 
Hintergrund benutze ich Nahaufnahmen des Needlepainting Werkes Land of 
Hope.</i></p><p>

</blockquote><h1><b>The Story</b></h1><h1><b><i>Die Geschichte</i></b></h1><p><br/></p>
<br/><p>The
 story focuses on Pepito, a man smaller than a blade of grass. He is 
envious of those around him who are big and strong, and his greatest 
wish is to be like them. He falls asleep one day and wakes up in the 
Land of Hope, where he meets many fascinating creatures. He asks each of
 them how he can become big and strong like them. </p>
<p>One after 
another, each character gives suggestions to help him become a better 
person, such as having respect for others, giving a helping hand where 
needed, having courage in tough situations, and so on. In the end, 
Pepito realizes that having a big heart is more important than having a 
big body, and that even if he is small he can still make great changes 
in the world. </p>
<p><i>Die Geschichte erzählt von Pepito, einem Männlein klein wie ein Grashalm .
 Er ist neidisch auf alle um ihn herum, die groß und kräftig sind, er 
wünscht sich ebenso zu sein. Eines tages erwachte er im Land der 
Hoffnung und trifft dort viele
 faszinierende Wesen. Er fragt jeden, wie er denn groß und stark werden 
könne. Einer nach dem anderen gibt einen Rat und macht Vorschläge, um 
ihm zu helfen. Z.B. Respekt für andere zu haben, anderen in der Not zu 
helfen oder Mut in schwierigen Situationen zu beweisen und so weiter. Am
 Ende versteht Pepito, dass es wichtiger ist ein großes Herz als einen 
großen Körper zu haben, und dass auch ein kleines Männlein große Dinge 
in der Welt bewirken kann!</i></p><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/721449/files/20140716073850-Pepito_in_Grass.png?1405521530"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h1><b>Why is this so important? </b></h1>
<h1><b><i>Warum ist dieses Buch wichtig?</i></b></h1>
<p><br/></p>
<br/><p>It is
 our belief that children cannot get enough positive influences in their
 growing years, so that they can become adults with good values to live 
by. When we raise a child to be good and compassionate, we bring more 
positive energy into the world. It's no secret that there are issues 
that exist around the globe that keep some people from living the best 
life they could have, and by teaching our next generations to be 
compassionate and helpful, we create a force for good that could, with 
time, bring peace to this world. The more we encourage children to have 
strong positive values, the closer we come to bringing the Land of Hope 
off the canvas and into reality.</p>
<p><i>Wir
 glauben fest daran, dass Kinder garnicht genug positive Einflüsse bei 
ihrer Erziehung erfahren können, um später als Erwachsene ein festes 
Fundament an positiven Glaubenssätzen zu haben. Jedes Kind, das zu 
Mitgefühl erzogen wird, wird selber immer einen positiven Beitrag in 
seinem Leben leisten. Die Welt ist vielerorts in Aufruhr, es gibt 
weltweit ernste Probleme. Da ist es wichtig, den Kindern liebevolle 
Energie und Erziehung zu geben, damit die Welt zu mehr Frieden und 
liebevollem Miteinander findet. Umso mehr Kinder starke positive 
Wertvorstellungen haben, umso eher kann aus dem Land of Hope Realität 
werden!</i></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We
 are also aiming to make this book multilingual, for two main reasons: 
1) We want Pepito's journey to be accessible to children all over the 
world, not just in English-speaking countries, and 2) exposing children 
to foreign languages at an early age helps them gain an interest in 
other cultures, which helps them develop the ideas of empathy and 
cooperation.  These go well with the other values presented in this 
book, and are especially helpful in our modern global world. Our base 
goal is for English and German, and we are working with a Japanese 
translator. Perhaps another language could be added if there is
 enough space and interest. We will keep you up-to-date on any 
developments.</p>
<p><i>Unser
 Ziel ist es, das Buch mehrsprachig heraus zu geben. Das hat mehrere 
Gründe, zum einem kann so Pepitos Geschichte in vielen Ländern gelesen 
und verstanden werden, zum anderen lernen Kinder 
von klein auf, dass es verschiedene Sprachen und Kulturen gibt, deren 
Unterschiedlichkeit wertfrei und selbstverständlich ist. Das ist in der 
globalen Welt von heute sicher von Vorteil. Im 
Moment gibt es die geschichte auf deutsch und englisch, eine japanische 
Übersetzung ist in Planung, auch andere Sprachen können hinzu gefügt 
werden, je nach Platz und Interesse. Wir halten Sie über die Entwicklung auf dem Laufenden,</i></p><br/>
<h1><b>What We Need</b></h1>
<h1><b><i>Was wir brauchen</i></b></h1>
<p><br/></p>
<br/><p>Land
 of Hope has already been fully written, and we are already working with
 a German publishing company, S. Fischer Verlage, to get it out into the
 world. They have given us a price estimate of 7,000 Euro as an absolute
 minimum for production. It's a greater amount than we can afford to pay
 out-of-pocket, which is 
why we are turning to you for help! Every dollar or euro counts. </p>
<p><i>Das

 Land der Hoffnung ist bereits fertig geschrieben, und wir sind in 
Kontakt mit einem deutschen Verlagshaus (S. Fischer Verlage). Dort hat 
man uns einen Mindestpreis von 7 500 € für Druck und Vertrieb genannt. 
Leider fehlt uns das nötige geld, so wenden wir uns an Sie - jeder noch 
so kleine Betrag hilft. </i></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>However,
 our ultimate goal is €13,000 - that would cover editing, printing, 
production, grade-A advertisement, shipping and distribution to 
bookstores around the country, and would also upgrade the book into a 
larger, more child-friendly format. We've read the statistics on 
successful crowdfunding projects and know that a lower number is easier 
to reach, so we're hoping your generosity will go above and beyond our 
minimum goal to help us reach €13,000.</p>
<p><i>Das
 ultimative Ziel sind 13 000 €, was ausser Druck und allen damit 
verbundenen Kosten wie Versand und Vertrieb eine Top-Grade-A- 
Werbeaktion mit einschliesst. Das Buch könnte so 
auch ein etwas größeres, kinderfreundlicheres Format bekommen. Wir haben
 uns über erfolgreiche Crowdfunding-Projekte informiert und hoffen sehr,
 dass wir es schaffen, die optimale Summe zu erzielen. </i></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Even if you can't 
contribute monetarily to Land of Hope, you can still help us out by 
spreading the word to anyone who may be interested! Sharing, emailing, 
tweeting, and word-of-mouth are absolutely invaluable to getting this 
project off the ground.</p>
<p><i>Wenn
 Sie im Moment finanziell nicht helfen können, freuen wir uns, wenn Sie 
helfen, indem Sie andere auf das Projekt aufmerksam machen, die 
vielleicht helfen können. Soziale Netzwerke, Emails, Kaffeklasch, 
Mundpropaganda, all dies trägt dazu bei, das Projekt zu verwirklichen. </i></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p> This book is perfect for parents of young
 children, expecting parents, or even aunts, uncles, grandparents, and 
other relatives searching for a gift for the young ones in their lives. </p>
<p><i>Dieses
 Buch ist ein schönes Geschenk für Eltern kleiner Kinder, also Eltern,

delay this process. If the crowdfuding isn't as successful as we hope, 
it may take some extra time to scrape up the last bit of money needed to
 pay the publishers. Printing may take longer than expected at the 
publishers, and mailing speeds can sometimes be unpredictable, 
especially internationally and around holidays. We can't know ahead of 
time what might happen, but we promise to keep you informed of all 
updates, good and bad, as soon as we find out about them. </p>
<p><i>Es können immer Dinge passieren, die den Ablauf verzögern. Wenn z.B. das
 Crowdfunding nicht den gewünschten Erfolg hat. kann es noch
 dauern, bis wir den Rest zusammen gekratzt haben. Der Druck kann läner

eine Verzögerung eintritt, werden alle benachrichtigt sobald wir davon 
Kenntnis haben.</i></p>

 centimeters. Each turn of the page will reveal a beautiful photograph 
from the Land of Hope tapestry, with a corresponding text (in at least 
two languages) on the other side that tells Pepito's story. Small 
sketches of the little man in various poses will appear alongside the 
text.</p>

SEE PERKS BELOWPERKS GANZ UNTENWhat is the Land of Hope?
Was ist das Land der Hoffnung?

Some years ago, I performed 
as a soloist with the San Francisco Ballet, and during my time backstage
 I took on a huge creative project that lasted nine years - to turn a 
blank square meter piece of fabric into a beautiful landscape using the 
art of needlepainting, or embroidery. The finished piece, pictured 
below, shows a spectacular world where humans and nature lived in 
perfect harmony with one another. I called it Land of Hope, as it 
depicts what I believe the world could be like if we empower ourselves 
and our children to do good. Während der Zeit, die ich als Solist des San Francisco Ballet hinter der Bühne bei Proben und Warten verbrachte, begann 
 ich ein Projekt, das letztlich neun Jahre dauerte: ich begann ein 
Einquadratmeter großes Stück Stoff lückenlos und mit Reliefs mit sehr 
dünnen Fäden zu besticken. Langsam entstand eine Märchenlandschaft, in 
der Menschen, Tiere und Fabelwesen in Harmonie miteinander und mit der 
Natur leben. So entstand das ""Land der Hoffnung"", von dem ich glaube, 
das es möglich ist, wenn wir und unsere Kindern sich dafür entscheiden.After leaving the ballet, my wife 
and I opened our own dance studio in Berlin. Over the years, we have 
watched many of our students grow from small children into beautiful, 
flourishing women and men with strong values of friendship, courage, and
 helpfulness. Inspired by their positive influences in the world, we 
wish to create a multilingual children's story book intended to empower 
even more children to grow as our students did and make the world a 
better place. Our book, based on the Land of Hope tapestry, would use 
close-up images taken from the needlepainting artwork to tell a story of
 how to grow up to be a strong person by encouraging children to respect
 others, have courage, and be helpful, along with many other important 
lessons.Nachdem
 ich das Ballett verliess, zog ich nach Berlin und schloss mich meiner 
Frau an, die dort ein Tanzstudio betrieb. Im Laufe der Jahre wurden wir 
Zeugen, wie aus kleinen Ballettschülern Erwachsene wurden, die als junge
 Männer und Frauen mit Werten wie Freundschaft, Mut und 
Hilfsbereitschaft lebten. Dies inspirierte mich zu der Idee eines 
Kinderbuches, das eine mehrsprachiges Geschichte erzählt. Und vielleicht
 andere Kinder beeinflusst ebenfalls andere zu respektieren, mutig und 
liebevoll zu sein, und die welt zu einem besseren Platz zu machen. Als 
Hintergrund benutze ich Nahaufnahmen des Needlepainting Werkes Land of 
Hope.

Land der Hoffnung, Landschaftsbild mit filigranen Details

The completed Land of Hope, a full landscape in astonishing detail.



The StoryDie Geschichte
The
 story focuses on Pepito, a man smaller than a blade of grass. He is 
envious of those around him who are big and strong, and his greatest 
wish is to be like them. He falls asleep one day and wakes up in the 
Land of Hope, where he meets many fascinating creatures. He asks each of
 them how he can become big and strong like them. 
One after 
another, each character gives suggestions to help him become a better 
person, such as having respect for others, giving a helping hand where 
needed, having courage in tough situations, and so on. In the end, 
Pepito realizes that having a big heart is more important than having a 
big body, and that even if he is small he can still make great changes 
in the world. 
Die Geschichte erzählt von Pepito, einem Männlein klein wie ein Grashalm .
 Er ist neidisch auf alle um ihn herum, die groß und kräftig sind, er 
wünscht sich ebenso zu sein. Eines tages erwachte er im Land der 
Hoffnung und trifft dort viele
 faszinierende Wesen. Er fragt jeden, wie er denn groß und stark werden 
könne. Einer nach dem anderen gibt einen Rat und macht Vorschläge, um 
ihm zu helfen. Z.B. Respekt für andere zu haben, anderen in der Not zu 
helfen oder Mut in schwierigen Situationen zu beweisen und so weiter. Am
 Ende versteht Pepito, dass es wichtiger ist ein großes Herz als einen 
großen Körper zu haben, und dass auch ein kleines Männlein große Dinge 
in der Welt bewirken kann!
One of Horacio's sketches of Pepito. Various images like this one 
will be scattered throughout the pages for children to find - more 
information on the imagined layout can be found further down on this 
page.Dies
 ist eine von Horacio´s Zeichnungen. Dies ist Pepito, der auf vielen 
Seiten auftaucht, wo ihn die Kinder suchen müssen. Mehr Information zum 
Lay-Out  weiter  unten auf deiser seite.



Why is this so important? 
Warum ist dieses Buch wichtig?

It is
 our belief that children cannot get enough positive influences in their
 growing years, so that they can become adults with good values to live 
by. When we raise a child to be good and compassionate, we bring more 
positive energy into the world. It's no secret that there are issues 
that exist around the globe that keep some people from living the best 
life they could have, and by teaching our next generations to be 
compassionate and helpful, we create a force for good that could, with 
time, bring peace to this world. The more we encourage children to have 
strong positive values, the closer we come to bringing the Land of Hope 
off the canvas and into reality.
Wir
 glauben fest daran, dass Kinder garnicht genug positive Einflüsse bei 
ihrer Erziehung erfahren können, um später als Erwachsene ein festes 
Fundament an positiven Glaubenssätzen zu haben. Jedes Kind, das zu 
Mitgefühl erzogen wird, wird selber immer einen positiven Beitrag in 
seinem Leben leisten. Die Welt ist vielerorts in Aufruhr, es gibt 
weltweit ernste Probleme. Da ist es wichtig, den Kindern liebevolle 
Energie und Erziehung zu geben, damit die Welt zu mehr Frieden und 
liebevollem Miteinander findet. Umso mehr Kinder starke positive 
Wertvorstellungen haben, umso eher kann aus dem Land of Hope Realität 
werden!

We
 are also aiming to make this book multilingual, for two main reasons: 
1) We want Pepito's journey to be accessible to children all over the 
world, not just in English-speaking countries, and 2) exposing children 
to foreign languages at an early age helps them gain an interest in 
other cultures, which helps them develop the ideas of empathy and 
cooperation.  These go well with the other values presented in this 
book, and are especially helpful in our modern global world. Our base 
goal is for English and German, and we are working with a Japanese 
translator. Perhaps another language could be added if there is
 enough space and interest. We will keep you up-to-date on any 
developments.
Unser
 Ziel ist es, das Buch mehrsprachig heraus zu geben. Das hat mehrere 
Gründe, zum einem kann so Pepitos Geschichte in vielen Ländern gelesen 
und verstanden werden, zum anderen lernen Kinder 
von klein auf, dass es verschiedene Sprachen und Kulturen gibt, deren 
Unterschiedlichkeit wertfrei und selbstverständlich ist. Das ist in der 
globalen Welt von heute sicher von Vorteil. Im 
Moment gibt es die geschichte auf deutsch und englisch, eine japanische 
Übersetzung ist in Planung, auch andere Sprachen können hinzu gefügt 
werden, je nach Platz und Interesse. Wir halten Sie über die Entwicklung auf dem Laufenden,
What We Need
Was wir brauchen

Land
 of Hope has already been fully written, and we are already working with
 a German publishing company, S. Fischer Verlage, to get it out into the
 world. They have given us a price estimate of 7,000 Euro as an absolute
 minimum for production. It's a greater amount than we can afford to pay
 out-of-pocket, which is 
why we are turning to you for help! Every dollar or euro counts. 
Das

 Land der Hoffnung ist bereits fertig geschrieben, und wir sind in 
Kontakt mit einem deutschen Verlagshaus (S. Fischer Verlage). Dort hat 
man uns einen Mindestpreis von 7 500 € für Druck und Vertrieb genannt. 
Leider fehlt uns das nötige geld, so wenden wir uns an Sie - jeder noch 
so kleine Betrag hilft. 

However,
 our ultimate goal is €13,000 - that would cover editing, printing, 
production, grade-A advertisement, shipping and distribution to 
bookstores around the country, and would also upgrade the book into a 
larger, more child-friendly format. We've read the statistics on 
successful crowdfunding projects and know that a lower number is easier 
to reach, so we're hoping your generosity will go above and beyond our 
minimum goal to help us reach €13,000.
Das
 ultimative Ziel sind 13 000 €, was ausser Druck und allen damit 
verbundenen Kosten wie Versand und Vertrieb eine Top-Grade-A- 
Werbeaktion mit einschliesst. Das Buch könnte so 
auch ein etwas größeres, kinderfreundlicheres Format bekommen. Wir haben
 uns über erfolgreiche Crowdfunding-Projekte informiert und hoffen sehr,
 dass wir es schaffen, die optimale Summe zu erzielen. 

Even if you can't 
contribute monetarily to Land of Hope, you can still help us out by 
spreading the word to anyone who may be interested! Sharing, emailing, 
tweeting, and word-of-mouth are absolutely invaluable to getting this 
project off the ground.
Wenn
 Sie im Moment finanziell nicht helfen können, freuen wir uns, wenn Sie 
helfen, indem Sie andere auf das Projekt aufmerksam machen, die 
vielleicht helfen können. Soziale Netzwerke, Emails, Kaffeklasch, 
Mundpropaganda, all dies trägt dazu bei, das Projekt zu verwirklichen. 

 This book is perfect for parents of young
 children, expecting parents, or even aunts, uncles, grandparents, and 
other relatives searching for a gift for the young ones in their lives.

 Buch ist ein schönes Geschenk für Eltern kleiner Kinder, also Eltern,

On the left, a Land of Hope folder. Ideally, the finished book will 
look something like this as well. On the right, Horacio's autobiography,

Idealerweise wird das Kinderbuch so aussehen. Rechts sehen Sie Horacio´s
 Autobiographie ""Confessions of a Male Belldancer"". Dies sind Beispiele 
für die Perks für Unterstützer.Predicted Timeline
Zeitplan

So, how long is this all going to take? 
So, wann wird was passieren?

In a perfect world, the timeline would look something like this:
Wenn alles klappt, sieht der Plan aus wie folgt:

October 31st, 2014: Crowdfunding begins!
Mid-December
 2014: Crowdfunding ends, all funds calculated, collected, and sent to 
publishers. Digital perks sent to supporters - just in time for the 
holidays!
January 2015: Publishing company begins production process for Land of Hope
Summer 2015: Printing is completed, books sent to Horacio and later distributed to bookstores
Summer/Fall 2015: Physical rewards shipped out to supporters, arriving once again just in time for the holidays!
31. Oktober 2014: das Crowdfunding beginnt!
Mitte Dezenber 2014: das Crowdfunding endet, alle Spenden gehen an den 
Verlag, die digitalen Perks (Belohnungen)  gehen an die Spender, 
pünktlich zum Weihnachtsfest!
Januar 2015: der Verlag beginnt die Produktion.
Sommer 2015: der Druck ist fertig, die Bücher werden versendet und an Buchläden verschickt.
Sommer/Herbst 2015: alle nicht-digitalen Perks , d.h. alle Geschenke werden verschickt, pünktlich zum nächsten Fest!Realistically, we know lots of things could happen to 
delay this process. If the crowdfuding isn't as successful as we hope, 
it may take some extra time to scrape up the last bit of money needed to
 pay the publishers. Printing may take longer than expected at the 
publishers, and mailing speeds can sometimes be unpredictable, 
especially internationally and around holidays. We can't know ahead of 
time what might happen, but we promise to keep you informed of all 
updates, good and bad, as soon as we find out about them. 
Es können immer Dinge passieren, die den Ablauf verzögern. Wenn z.B. das
 Crowdfunding nicht den gewünschten Erfolg hat. kann es noch
 dauern, bis wir den Rest zusammen gekratzt haben. Der Druck kann läner 
dauern, Versandzeiten können abweichen (vor allem international). Falls 
eine Verzögerung eintritt, werden alle benachrichtigt sobald wir davon 
Kenntnis haben.

How it Will Look
Wie wird das Buch aussehen?

We are envisioning our book to be approximately 22 x 1 x 30
 centimeters. Each turn of the page will reveal a beautiful photograph 
from the Land of Hope tapestry, with a corresponding text (in at least 
two languages) on the other side that tells Pepito's story. Small 
sketches of the little man in various poses will appear alongside the 
text.
Wir planen das Buch in der Größe 22
 x 1 x 30 cm. Bei jedem Umblättern sieht man eine neue Seite mit einem 
Bildausschenitt des Werkes ""Land der Hoffnung"" zeigen mit den dazu 
gehörigen Texten in mindestens zwei Sprachen auf der gegenüberliegenden 
Seite. Kleine Zeichnungen des kleinen Pepito ergänzen das Bild.


One of our draft pages. So far, this only has the German text, and 
the height isn't exactly right. As soon as we have an updated version of
 this, we will let you know! See below for the English and Japanese translations that 
will be on this page: Hier ein Beispiel, erstmal nur mit dem deutschen Text und vorläufigem Format. Der englische Text folgt:


'To his great surprise Pepito met a man who was even smaller then he was.
Pepito said to him: “How can you be happy being so very small?”
And the small man answered: “Because I see that life is full of treasures like this pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.”
“Yes”, said Pepito, “I see. But I want to be big.”
“Good,"" said the small man, “then you must respect all persons 
whether they are smaller or bigger than you; then you will be big. Come 
with me to the pond for a drink.”'

<h3>¿Qué?</h3>
<p><strong>Notas sueltas</strong> es una de esas historias con múltiples capas semánticas que, para deleite del lector, se van abriendo a media que avanzan sus páginas ofreciendo un punto de vista para cada nuevo tema que va surgiendo.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Cuando, a partir de un encuentro absolutamente casual, Diego Jiménez Guzmán, famoso cantaor de flamenco, y Marta Roca Forcadell, soprano de reconocido prestigio en el mundo de la ópera, comienzan a vivir una apasionada historia de amor, los dos saben que esa relación no va a ser precisamente un camino de rosas, dada su acendrada pertenencia a mundos tan distintos.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">El excluyente ideario nacionalista que practica parte de la familia de Marta y la automarginación social que profesa la familia gitana de Diego, ponen  impedimentos más que suficientes al avance de un amor contra el cual algunos llegan a emplear todo tipo de malas artes, incluyendo la conspiración y el terror, que arrastra a los dos protagonistas a un forzado exilio.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Sin duda, un testimonio del momento político que vive hoy la sociedad catalana, pero, sobre todo, un testimonio humano que habla de libertad, de justicia, y de amor; el amor de siempre, muy anterior a las diferencias de origen y cultura.  </p>
<h3>¿Quiénes?</h3>
<p><strong>Tandaia </strong>es una joven editorial con voluntad de cambio, de dar la alternativa a autores que no la encuentran en otro lugar, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el <i>crowdfunding</i>.</p>

</div></div>","¿Qué?
Notas sueltas es una de esas historias con múltiples capas semánticas que, para deleite del lector, se van abriendo a media que avanzan sus páginas ofreciendo un punto de vista para cada nuevo tema que va surgiendo.
Cuando, a partir de un encuentro absolutamente casual, Diego Jiménez Guzmán, famoso cantaor de flamenco, y Marta Roca Forcadell, soprano de reconocido prestigio en el mundo de la ópera, comienzan a vivir una apasionada historia de amor, los dos saben que esa relación no va a ser precisamente un camino de rosas, dada su acendrada pertenencia a mundos tan distintos.
El excluyente ideario nacionalista que practica parte de la familia de Marta y la automarginación social que profesa la familia gitana de Diego, ponen  impedimentos más que suficientes al avance de un amor contra el cual algunos llegan a emplear todo tipo de malas artes, incluyendo la conspiración y el terror, que arrastra a los dos protagonistas a un forzado exilio.
Sin duda, un testimonio del momento político que vive hoy la sociedad catalana, pero, sobre todo, un testimonio humano que habla de libertad, de justicia, y de amor; el amor de siempre, muy anterior a las diferencias de origen y cultura.  
¿Quiénes?
Tandaia es una joven editorial con voluntad de cambio, de dar la alternativa a autores que no la encuentran en otro lugar, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el crowdfunding.
De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.
Hoy te presentamos a José Montero.
Nacido en Lena (Asturias). Profesionalmente, ha sido ejecutivo de nivel medio en una empresa de ámbito estatal. Ha desempañado distintas responsabilidades sindicales durante algunos años: desde Secretario General del Sindicato Ferroviario de UGT, o Secretario de Formación de la Federación de Transportes UGT de Cataluña, a miembro de la Comisión Ejecutiva Nacional de la UGT de Cataluña.
Ha sido Concejal del Ayuntamiento de Ripoll (1979 -1981) y Diputado del Parlament de Catalunya en la primera legislatura (1980 – 1984); así como escritor novel con algunos títulos publicados eBooks Kindle: Del rojo vivo al rosa fuerte, Las ruinas del molino viejo, Víctima de la buena suerte, Crónica de un encuentro imposible, La misma.
¿Cómo?
Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 880€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cuarenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.

<p>Hello, I am<strong> <a href=""http://www.swamicat.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Swami Cat</a></strong>.  The Puppet Guru who teaches little Yogis how to stretch, breathe and laugh their way to purrr-fect peace! Since 2013 Yoga Girl (A.K.A. Karuna Lynne, Yoga Instructor and public school theatre teacher) and I have created performances, workshops, videos, books and most recently a Yoga CD! Through the use of Yoga poses, breathing exercises, songs and stories, I teach meditation and mindfulness to the young and young-at-heart.</p>
<p>At the end of a peaceful Yoga festival a few years ago, children were helping us clean up when a bee flew into our sight. The children screamed and one previously sweet, helpful young boy swatted at the bee in order to harm it. It was a teachable moment in which to remind the children that Yoga is about not wishing harm on any living thing and that bees are not scary. They are amazing &amp; vital for our survival!</p>
<p>When we met SonnyBee, a young honey bee who loves to teach others about how ""Healthy hives give us healthy lives,"" Yoga Girl and I knew we had found the perfect collaborator. We spent a few months writing it and we're so excited to share it with you. Here's the synopsis:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;"">Swami Cat &amp; Yoga Girl are biking in the beautiful woods when they bump into a little bee, named SonnyBee. SonnyBee is worried because his best friend BillyBee is missing. Together they search for him and meet a turtle, a frog and a farmer. The farmer is about to harm a beehive. They learn the importance of bees, as well as ahimsa-- the Yoga word for non-violence. Will SonnyBee, Swami Cat and Yoga Girl save the beehive and find BillyBee?</p>

<h3>My Deal</h3>
<p>In 2010 I was broke, homeless, and unable to find work. Through some miracle I managed to make a little money selling short science fiction and horror on Amazon, iBooks, and Barnes &amp; Noble, and by the end of 2011 I was bringing in four figures a month in royalties and no longer homeless. I did so well that I was able to stop spending time sending out endless job applications.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2018 and I'm supporting myself writing novels, designing tabletop rpg products, and producing podcasts. I'm still poor, but I'm able to earn enough to live on, and that is a pretty big deal for someone without a day job. Fortunate too, since I've been doing this for seven years and that gap in my work history makes finding a job almost impossible.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it barely covers my ""not being homeless"" expenses, so when something happens - a laptop breaking, for example - I don't have the emergency funds to get a new one.</p>

<h3>To keep working I need a new laptop</h3>
<p>I don't need much from a laptop, just one that provides me with the minimum necessary to run the software I use to create my books. Scrivener, InDesign, Photoshop. You get the picture. $500, the minimum IndieGoGo lets you run a campaign for, should be enough.</p>
<p>Maybe if we make more I'll pick up something better. That'd be nice.</p>

<h3>The Cornish Legends Book</h3>
<p>I am Sheridan James Lunt, and I have made animating Cornish legends my passion. My animated series 'Piski Tells the Cornish Legends' can be seen on youtube.</p>
<p>I’ve had a life-long interest in world mythology, and especially the arts that accompany such story-telling. The storybooks in my library are treasured objects and enduring inspirations.</p>
<p>I began learning Cornish Folklore while living in Falmouth. The tradition comprises an alternate history in which all Cornwall’s dangerous beauty and melancholy desolation play out in the lives of celebrated Cornishmen and Women whose very names have been remembered. For those who know and love this country, these stories are the heart and soul of Cornwall.</p>
<p>Our folkloric traditions are kept alive by their retelling, and I believe the artworks and writing I have composed on this subject would make a beautiful book. It retells nine classic stories, of mermaids, giants, piskeys, smugglers, witches and ghosts, with thirty full colour illustrations evoking Cornwall’s myriad aspects.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Through this campaign I hope to raise £1,111 to fund a first edition.</p>
<p>Any donation, no matter how small, would be so gratefully received.</p>
<p>However, all contributions above £10 will be thanked with a 6 track mp3 download of the audiobook. </p>
<p>A £35 donation secures the kind donator their own numbered edition of the book.</p>
<p>A £45 donation receives a signed and numbered book</p>
<p>A £55 donation sees the name of the contributor appear in print, with thanks, within the book itself.</p>
<p>A £70 donation receives two books, numbered signed and with the contributor's name in print. </p>
<p>Donations above £95 will secure the opportunity of owning original artwork used in the animated series, including puppets and hand-drawn pictures. Of course these are unique and variable, and I will contact contributors personally to find the right items, appropriate to their contribution. Also all previous perks.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The retelling of folkloric traditions keeps them alive, and books like these make their contribution. I have also been developing the project more widely, with a view to creating a live storytelling show that could include projections and puppetry. The project could help connect audiences everywhere, but especially those in Cornwall itself, with the country's magnificent cultural heritage.</p>
<p>I'm delighted to announce that Kowethas an Yeth Kernewek: The Cornish Language Fellowship have begun the work of translating my animated stories into Cornish, which improves the educational aspect, and extends the reach of the project tremendously.</p>
<p>All this, together with the proposed print of this book, would support the furtherance of Cornish life and culture.</p>

Over 10,000 people come to the festival each year.Yet, there has never been a book about the history of the festival or ways of showing off the amazing photographs by the talented photographers who have captured the visual history of the festival for over five decades.   Three of us, Eric Ring, Jayne Toohey, and John Lupton came together and decided to put together a coffee table book that celebrated the stories and the photos that make this festival loved by thousands.Dozens of photographers donated their images for this project and we have photos from the very first festival in 1962 up to modern times. Have you ever told people about how you go to the festival every year, but they don't understand your passion?  The book will be a great addition to your coffee table or bookshelf and will show family and friends why this festival is such an important part of your life.The book also has many of the countless stories that we collected from volunteers and festival-goers. For example, when Mike McGrath (also known from hosting  the nationally syndicated NPR show ""You Bet Your Garden"") was a member of the security committee and had to deal with a gang of bikers that come to the festival.The first phalanx of bikers showed up around noon. Mike remembers, “They had a ritual where they would all arrive together and pull up in these straight lines. And at some unseen signal - I was standing right there - they turned their bikes off, all at the same time, and it went from this deafening roar to a deafening silence.” Have you ever wondered what musician played in what year?If we meet our goal we intend to have an index up through the 2017 or 2018 festival of every musician who has played at the festival and what year.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Our perceptions of ourselves and of the greater world around us influence the choices we make every day. In turn, the choices we make influence our perspective of the world around us. The very act of making those choices helps each of us define our own unique sense of purpose.<br/><br/>I’m Michelle Phillips, author of Little Big Head, a book that explores the role our choices play in creating a life full of meaning. When reading this book, we’ll explore what can happen — and did happen to me — when outside influences skew our self-perception and our world view. In Little Big Head, I allow my own personal stories to unfold in unflinching detail: lessons learned, challenges conquered, relationships made, and improvements that have yet to come.It is my hope that along the way you’ll enjoy getting to know me and I’ll even enjoy getting to know myself again. This book is more than just a trip down memory lane. It’s a quest to understand myself, my world and my choices. I hope this book provides you with the reassurance that no matter who you are or where your choices have led you thus far, you, too, have the power to choose change and to create a meaningful, purpose-filled life.</p>
<p>I wrote this book to discover how choice plays a role in how we see the world around us, and how making choices helps us to define our own unique sense of purpose.<br/><br/>When reading this book, you will enjoy personal stories about my life that examine how the choices we make give our life meaning. This book will provide you clarity and reassurance that you are on the right path, and need to make the choice that is best for you, no matter what. Our family, friends, community members and the media can sometimes skew our perception of the world around us. It is important that we take time to reflect on this. I have found knowing yourself, at your core, can only be achieved through reflection and curiosity. Understanding the situation and the need and hunger to learn more. These two things have played a large role in the way I view myself, and the world around me. This book is a recount of my life until today, the lessons I’ve learned, challenges conquered, relationships made, and the improvement that has yet to come. I hope this book provides you with the reassurance that as a culture, we really aren’t that different. No matter who you are or where you come from, everyday we make choices that have power to change our lives for the better.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about my struggle and successes with education, control and confidence.</p>
<ul>
<li>Education: I grew up thinking that I was not smart and would not achieve anything of prestige when it came to my academics. After being put down by assignments, test scores and teachers, I thought there was no way to improve. I didn’t understand the point. I didn’t realize what exactly I was learning. I learned many things in school that did not come from a textbook. We must ask questions, understand the process and be willing to be vulnerable in order to improve. My experience in the classroom taught me several things I textbook never could, and for that, I am thankful.</li>
<li>Control: As human beings, we long for a sense of ownership, for control over outcomes, for final say in decisions that impact our lives. Even in situations where we have the autonomy to call our own shots, our power comes with limitations. We can’t change people or control their thoughts, their choices. We only have the power to control what goes on inside of our own little heads and the choices we make every day. And sometimes, the most powerful thing we can do is to have the courage to admit we need help.</li>
<li>Confidence: I can attribute much of my academic and professional success to my sense of self-confidence. I have found that having a “Little Big Head” is essential to understand who you are, what you’re doing and where you want to go. Your head has to be big enough to have the confidence to take the risk and prove to others you believe in yourself, but small enough to have humility in knowing that there is always room for improvement. Building confidence is not always the easiest thing to do, but it comes from your core, doing things 100% for you and pursuing the things you truly feel passionate about.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>You will like this book if you have ever found yourself short on confidence and slightly out of control. You’ll love this book if you’re open to self-reflection and hungry to learn how the choices we make at critical moments help us define who we are and what we believe in.<br/><br/>Little Big Head is a non-fiction book that speaks to young adults transitioning from a history of structured education to the harsh realities of the real world. curious individuals who are interested in my journey in understanding how my choices have defined my sense of self.</p>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Book - Little Big Head</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The book is written in three Parts....</span></p>
<p><br/>Part one contains the introduction and stories that detail my relationship with religion. Part one also introduces my passion for acting and my summer camp experiences. This section introduces the initial understanding I had of myself, and the important moments that shaped the way I got to know my surroundings.<br/><br/>Part two contains Chapters 7-12. This section deals with my experiences in high school. The development and experiences we have in high school have the ability to make an imprint on the way we view the world and understand those around us. Rival high schools that merged into one, an extreme drop in confidence due to a test score, an eating disorder that disrupted my life and relationships were just a few of the moments that were critical to building myself into the person I am today.<br/><br/>Part three contains Chapters 13-14. In order to fully understand how the decisions we make have a direct impact on the course of our life and our physical and emotional well being, I must give you an update on where I am today. My parents are getting older, I am moving across the country and life isn’t slowing down for anyone. In the next six months, my life is going to change dramatically. But I have to stick to my roots, listen to Joni Mitchell and remember that every large problem can be broken down into simple, achievable steps.</p>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Michelle Phillips loves being outside, singing Landslide (Dixie Chicks version) and eating nachos. She was raised on microwave popcorn, Joni Mitchell and the CBS show Survivor. Among these passions, she loves to talk to people and deeply understands the importance of sharing a good laugh with a great friend.<br/><br/>A senior at the University of Michigan, she too is crying and dealing with the emotions of COVID-19 ending her college career.

I initially wanted to understand how entertainers can be successful in the entertainment industry coming from “untraditional” backgrounds. This idea evolved into a deeper understanding of how we make pivotal choices to change our lives, the risk in these choices and the aftermath of making them.<br/><br/>For more information you can connect with Michelle at michellemariephil@gmail.com and LinkedIn - <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-phillips-500b4b131/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-phillips-5...</a>.<br/> </p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Economic
signals are everywhere, from fashion magazine covers to grocery stores to
military events. They empower by revealing the story of the world economy with
all its stark contradictions. Central banks are trying to create inflation but
say there is little chance it will happen, yet many feel their cost of living
is already rising. Interest rates are at record low levels but the debt still
seems to be at record highs. Stock markets are at record highs but economies
still feel weak. </p>
<p>These
conflicting pressures are stressing and breaking the vital social contracts that
exist between citizens and their governments. They set in motion many seemingly
unrelated outcomes: social unrest, the movement of manufacturing and jobs back to
the US and the West and the return of geopolitics between the superpowers. The
solution is risk-taking and innovation. Luckily, tomorrow’s economy is already
being built today. By being alert to the many signals around us, anyone can
better navigate through the turbulence to the treasures of the world economy.</p>

<p>Oh and I very deliberately chose hot pink as the signature colour for <i>Signals</i>. Economics is cool and sexy. It's about the forces that touch your life every day. Why do all the examples in economics have to be about steel or auto parts? I use examples like shoes, </p>

</div></div>","PLEASE NOTE: ALL ORDERS WILL BE SENT ONCE CAMPAIGN HAS ENDED ON FEB 14th. WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE THAT SUPPORTED THE SIGNALS CAMPAIGN AND MADE IT SUCH A SUCCESSBusting/Hacking the publishing business model: that's why I, a former Presidential Advisor (@DrPippaM), am offering you my non-fiction/economics book on Indiegogo. It's called Signals: The Breakdown of the Social Contract and the Rise of Geopolitics. Nobody has launched a serious book on economics this way before (see the reviews from Heads of Governments, CEOs and 16 year olds below and don't miss the shoes and magazine covers too). It costs £17.00 for the hardcover and £13.00 for the ebook.Just click the pink CONTRIBUTE NOW button on the right then ADD PERK on the next page and choose the version you want - the hardcover or the ebook. Don't worry about the contribution amount above that button, you can choose the price on the next page.For bulk book orders please use the perk for 10 or 50 or 100 copies or just use the ""custom"" button on the hardcover perk page and put in the overall amount you want (so 100 copies is £1700). If you want signed copies (bulk orders only for now), email us on signals@drpmgroup.comIF YOU CONTRIBUTE BUT DON'T WANT A BOOK WE'LL USE THE CAPITAL FOR BUILDING THE IDEAS LIKE THE YOUNG AMBASSADORS PROGRAM (another perk) WHERE WE WILL WORK WITH YOUNG PEOPLE WHO LOVE ECONOMICS BUT ARE FRUSTRATED THAT ECONOMICS DEMANDS SO MUCH MATH AND FAILS TO ADDRESS THE KEY SOCIAL ISSUES OF OUR TIME. I ALSO PLAN TO LAUNCH A USEFUL AND FUNNY ECONOMICS VIDEO SERIES SHORTLY TO HELP SPREAD THE WORD.I am aiming to sell a minimum of 1000 copies during the Indiegogo campaign before launching it to the wider public (on January 13th, 2015 in the LSE Public Lecture Series). But, the big goal is to empower you, the reader, so that you can navigate the world economy better than ever before. The
book is a finished product and ready to go (it's taken me three years and a
long career in economics to write it!) 
More than anything, I am asking you to buy and read Signals so that together we can change the language of economics. Economics does not have to be all math, formulas and complicated theory (see my chapter four which is called ""The Algorithm Made me Do It""). Economics is also about everyday events that ""signal"" to us from fashion magazine covers (I write about this particular British Vogue cover - Thank you Conde Nast for giving me permission to use the image!) ....to military events (between the US, Russia and China and others) to the shrinking size of steaks and the reduced size and number of chocolates in a box. (See below for examples about shoes, fighter jets, F1 and more...)

Here's what some experts have to say about my book....



James Galbraith, Chair in Government/Business, University of
Texas “better than Piketty"". (Thomas Piketty is the author of the best-selling economics book in modern history, Capital, which is mainly full of math, theory and about how to redistribute wealth. This is the opposite of my book, which is all about explaining the world economy in plain English and helping the public be part of the economy of tomorrow which is already being built today!) 
Rohan Bedi, 16 year old student “absolutely loved reading it.”



Dr. Tun Mahathir Mohamad, former Prime Minister of Malaysia “Dr. Pippa Malmgren’s book is essential reading”. 
Sir Stuart Rose, former CEO and Chairman Marks and Spencer,
says the ideas here are “a Tour de Force”.



Tidjane Thiam, CEO Prudential Plc “provocative ideas” and a “unique perspective”.
The Hon. Ambassador John Bruton, Former Prime Minister of Ireland “a great book”.



Dr. Liam Fox, former British Defence Minister, British MP “Pippa’s work is
impressive and groundbreaking.""



Heidi Roizen, Partner DFJ and Board DMGT (Silicon Valley Venture Capital) “Dr. Pippa Malmgren’s book is a must read, full of insights into what our ‘regular’ world can tell us about the future shape of our economic reality.”



Toshio Fukui, Former Governor Bank of Japan “fascinating,
stimulating book! First-class quality.”
Peter van Manen, Mclaren (F1) “opens our eyes”. 
Peter Pereira Gray, Wellcome Trust “a delightfully easy read, a
precious gift indeed”.



Leslie Sheppard, CSO MIT Forum for Supply Chain Innovation “gives
us great optimism”. 




Art Laffer, former US Presidential Economic Advisor “Making economics colorful, intelligible, cool and accessible to the general public, Pippa has written a winner for one and all.”
Greg Williamson, CIO BP Pension Fund, “stellar” “I love this book!”
Major General Nick Pope CBE, Master of Signals Intelligence, British Ministry of Defence “a fascinating read. Full of lateral insights”.
Philip Blackwell, former owner Blackwell’s books “This timely
book combines an engaging and accessible style with a fresh lens
through which to think about and start making sense of the fast
changing world we live in.”

James Rickards, author of Currency Wars, “At the true convergence
of geopolitics + global capital, there are only a few pros. One is
@DrPippaM.”

Bob Jenkins, former board of the Financial Policy Committee,
Bank of England “One lesson remains to be relearned since the
financial crisis – geopolitical risk. Learn it here.”

Laura Susa, undergraduate at Melbourne University “it’s a
fantastic book! The examples will appeal to a broad range of
people.” 
Here is an interview I did about the ""Maker Movement"" which is so very important in the world economy today.




If you need more, here is the short description on the inside front flap:


Signals Inside Front Flap


Economic
signals are everywhere, from fashion magazine covers to grocery stores to
military events. They empower by revealing the story of the world economy with
all its stark contradictions. Central banks are trying to create inflation but
say there is little chance it will happen, yet many feel their cost of living
is already rising. Interest rates are at record low levels but the debt still
seems to be at record highs. Stock markets are at record highs but economies
still feel weak. 
These
conflicting pressures are stressing and breaking the vital social contracts that
exist between citizens and their governments. They set in motion many seemingly
unrelated outcomes: social unrest, the movement of manufacturing and jobs back to
the US and the West and the return of geopolitics between the superpowers. The
solution is risk-taking and innovation. Luckily, tomorrow’s economy is already
being built today. By being alert to the many signals around us, anyone can
better navigate through the turbulence to the treasures of the world economy.


Oh and I very deliberately chose hot pink as the signature colour for Signals. Economics is cool and sexy. It's about the forces that touch your life every day. Why do all the examples in economics have to be about steel or auto parts? I use examples like shoes, 

fashion (Ralph and Russo), artwork (For The Love of God), F1 Racing    Team Brawn GP
 The America's Cup Yacht Race,    John Bertrand
motorcycle maintenance (Shop Class), 
and even perfume (a beautiful story of risk taking)   
Of course, there are also references to useful Nobel prize winning ideas from Sir John Hicks, Friederich von Hayek and Albert Einstein ...     and a lesson from chess.....

But, I also explain why Greek mythology matters in economics (see the chapter called ""Hubris and Nemesis"" and my conclusion, ""Cutting through the Gordian Knot""). Finally, find out why it matters (to you) that Tolkien's character, Gollum, lives above the door in the Oval Office ( I saw him when I worked there....).

<h3>What is Hypocrite Reader?</h3>
<p>Hypocrite Reader is an online leftist magazine founded in Brooklyn in 2011. Each issue is centered around a theme, like PROPHECIES, SYMPTOMS, or GENERATION. You can view our complete list of past themes here. We publish writing that is conceptual and timely, useful and unexpected.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why do we need money now?</h3>
<p>Since July 2020, we have been a paying market. We remain committed to paying our contributors while keeping our articles free to readers. While we work toward developing a steady stream of funding through our <a href=""https://www.patreon.com/hypocritereader"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Patreon</a>, we’re asking for your help to accomplish two short-term goals: publishing our summer issue, TEETH, and hiring a web designer.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Money for TEETH</h3>
<p>On July 15th, 2021, we will publish our 98th issue, <a href=""https://hypocritereader.com/contribute"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TEETH</a>. The bulk of the money we need is for writers. Our intensive editing process demands considerable work from our contributors, and we want to pay them fairly for it. On top of that, some amount of money will be used to promote their articles in order to help them build the readership they deserve, and some will be used to pay a featured artist.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Money for Web Design</h3>
<p>As the magazine has expanded, it has gradually outgrown many aspects of its 2011 site design. While you may not be able to tell from afar, the magazine’s neck is twisted sideways and its limbs are popping out the windows. Our long wishlist of improvements includes, among other things, a way to notify casual readers of upcoming events, contests, and special projects; accessibility tools, such as a large font option; the ability to retain new visitors by suggesting an article to read next and making it easier to browse through an issue; flexible formatting options for articles that don’t fit the standard mold; and certain aesthetic improvements. While we have yet to decide just how far the aesthetic redesign will go, we all agree that functionality improvements are crucial and should be implemented in a way that looks nice—and that means hiring a web designer.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Money for Miscellany</h3>
<p>A small fraction of the money we earn will go toward paying our web dues and shipping out the perks associated with this campaign.</p> <h3>What We’ve Accomplished Since Last Time</h3>
<p>Our October fundraiser surpassed its goal, due in substantial part to a single extremely generous donation. In January, we published <a href=""https://hypocritereader.com/96/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PROPHECIES</a>, complete with artwork by and an interview with our first-ever “featured artist,” <a href=""https://hypocritereader.com/96/interview-zupa"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ravi Amar Zupa</a>. In April, we surprised you with a followup mini-issue, <a href=""https://hypocritereader.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PROPHECIES II</a>, with four more articles and an original cover animation. Taken together, PROPHECIES and PROPHECIES II represent the largest issue Hypocrite Reader has ever published, and this mega-issue has received more hits than any other issue in its first months of publication since we began keeping records. We were able to pay each contributor more than $100 for their work, which is remarkable for an institutionally-unaffiliated magazine of our size. And several people told us that <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQTI-8V7ak"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the event we held </a>to celebrate the launch of PROPHECIES was one of the warmest and most free-flowing online discussions they’d attended. </p>
<p>Over the same six months since our last fundraiser, we’ve also brought several new editors into our horizontal collective and said goodbye to one. We’ve created a <a href=""https://www.patreon.com/hypocritereader"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Patreon</a>, and had a great deal of fun writing our monthly patrons-only newsletters. The newsletter we sent out on the first of May included an advice column and an annotated playlist, and we’ve got lots more creative content coming your way. We have nearly 4,000 <a href=""https://twitter.com/HypocriteRdr?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Twitter</a> followers now; when Twitter Czar Erica Eisen started her devilish rituals, we had about four hundred. And we've completed the first, exploratory phase of our website redesign process. </p>
<p>We’re very grateful for the support we’ve received over the last year. When editor Cat Pierro emailed us a year ago to suggest a reboot, not one of us expected that the project would become such a large part of our lives. We’re glad it has. If you’re one of the people who have helped make our work possible, whether financially or otherwise—thank you.  </p>

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<i>Dear Jesus, Send Coffee: Finding Joy in the Chaos of Early Motherhood</i> is a collection of funny truths, explorations of reality versus expectation, and interviews with real mamas and experts about the beautiful and trying time that is early motherhood. In this book we explore the common insecurities of moms, the personal and societal reasons they exist, and finally, how to move past them to reclaim your joy!<br/><br/>My name is Meredith Redmon and I am the author of <i>Dear Jesus, Send Coffee</i>. I wrote this book because I know how hard the beginning of motherhood can be.

Franchise Mega-Brand
-	A franchise system that excels to greatness with a profitable and sustainable franchisee business model.

During the course of writing 5 Pennies, I interviewed a number of well-known franchise executives such as Fred DeLuca, the Founder & CEO of SUBWAY, Melanie Bergeron, Chair of Two Men and a Truck, along with many others because their companies are included in the book as ""Best of Class"" examples in various chapters. While conducting these interviews, I also had some of them read draft excerpts of my manuscript for feedback on the overall content. 
Resoundingly - they have all told me that I am spot-on with the focus of the book and that it will tremendously help existing brands of any size shore up their foundation and formulate strategic plans. In addition, entrepreneurs growing their business and considering franchising as an expansion model will find 5 Pennies to be a ""must have"" strategic planning guide for doing it right the first time.
Many
other books have been written about ""how to"" franchise a business,
but none exist about how to effectively manage and grow a national franchise brand.

Would they have normal, healthy babies? Or would they pass on the virus, leading to a resurgence in the epidemic? And finally, it's the story of how an unlikely, 13-year-long study of couples around the world proved the unthinkable true: That unprotected sex can be safer sex for some couples, thus clearing the way for babies like Ryan.</span></p>

<br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Ryan Nicole Hartmann is a miracle of modern science. Ten fingers, 10 toes, and zero HIV.
That's saying something, considering how she was conceived. Her HIV-positive father had sex with his HIV-negative wife. Without a condom. And no one got HIV.
The story of how Ryan and babies like her came to be is the story of couples and scientists who imagined a world in which unprotected sex didn't have to be a death sentence. And it's a story of risk: about the risks women take every day to have sex with their HIV-positive husbands, how much risk they're willing to to take to have a baby, and the potential risks to all of us if they were to throw away the condoms. Would they have normal, healthy babies? Or would they pass on the virus, leading to a resurgence in the epidemic? And finally, it's the story of how an unlikely, 13-year-long study of couples around the world proved the unthinkable true: That unprotected sex can be safer sex for some couples, thus clearing the way for babies like Ryan.
That's what HIV and Baby Makes Three is all about. It's the rigorously reported, compassionately written, real-life story of two couples, their longing for a family and the scientists, doctors and researchers who helped--and hindered them--along the way.
This is where you come in.
Why an Indiegogo campaign?
Help me turn this piece of long-form journalism into a Kindle Single. The reporting and writing of the story is complete. But before it can go to Amazon for publishing, it must be edited and fact-checked thoroughly. Then, publishing the article as an ebook will allow me to take advantage of the capabilities of the medium to use photos, graphics and animations to explain some of the more scientifically tricky facts. The $6,000 breaks down this way:


$1,100 for editing
$1,500 for fact-checking
$400 for graphic design
$1,000 for photography of the couples in San Francisco and Maryland
$2,000 for animations
$500 for contingencies

* What happens if we raise more than $6,000? All additional funds will go toward additional interactive elements, videos and promotion of the ebook.

FAQ


This article does not promote unsafe sex. Rather, it lays out exactly how hard a decision it was for these couples to decide to go against decades of conventional wisdom, as well as the scientific and ethical challenges doctors face in helping their HIV-positive patients and their partners create a family.
Having said that, it also does not stigmatize HIV-discordant couples for wanting to have children. It sees this drive to form a family as normal and natural.
This is not an opinion piece. This is a piece of journalism that follows two couples from falling in love to having their first child. It includes doctors, scientists, and public health officials who put their journey into context, with both advances in HIV science and the current state of the epidemic.
This story focuses on HIV-positive men and their HIV-negative wives. There are HIV-positive women married to HIV-negative men, of course, and a world of research on transmission rates between gay men. Those stories are worth telling, too, but they aren't this story.
HIV-discordant couples adopt every year. That's a great story, and this article does address the question of adoption. But it's about couples trying to get pregnant the old-fashioned way.
This story is not about magical thinking. While it is told from the perspective of the couples, it's also deeply rooted in the science of HIV medicine and teaches readers what HIV is like today.

Will you help me?This story is about two things: The shocking news out of the scientific community that unprotected sex doesn't have to be a death sentence, and the medications that make that possible; and the totally human yearning for a family. Put those together and what you have is a disease that has changed, even while our ideas about HIV have stayed, often, stuck in the 1980s.
