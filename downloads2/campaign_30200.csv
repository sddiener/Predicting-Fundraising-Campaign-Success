<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>On January 17th myself (Aneesa), Morea, Natalie and Kelsey will be running the HCMC marathon to raise money for the Cau Han Community Development Project - which is one of the HCMC Child Welfare Association's projects!</p>
<h3>Who are The Cau Han? </h3>
</div><div>
<p>The Cau Han (who Natalie and I work for) is a community based development project which provides compulsory education to migrant children, poor children, and children from communities affected with HIV/AIDS - children who have NO OTHER MEANS OF ACCESSING EDUCATION.</p>
<p>The Cau Han also provides non formal education, including workshops and training on everything from 'life skills' and 'HIV awareness' to 'Abuse prevention' for the local community. The Cau Han also provides healthcare and access to organisations which provide support for underprivileged people, as well as securing non-exploitative work and training opportunities for young people.</p>
<p><strong>As of May 2021 the Cau Han's funding will end and the children will have no more access to education. </strong> </p>
<h3>Where will your donation go?</h3>
<p>We are confident that we'll raise enough funding to keep the Cau Han school open, but we need the help of people like yourself! With your donation, we can keep the center open, pay the utilities, provide basic essentials like water and fans, as well as providing the students with essential learning items - books, pens and pencils!</p>
<p><strong>Education is commonly the only thing standing between a happy life, and a life of exploitation and abuse for the Cau Han children, please help us to help them break the cycle of poverty!</strong></p>
<h3>How you can help!</h3>
<p>If you know us, give us a donation! Anything will do, from a fiver to five hundred, please support us so we can help these young people live better lives!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you're unable to donate on here for any reason but still want to sponsor us, or support this charity, The Cau Han also have a Paypal - <u><strong>hcwa.vn@gmail.com</strong></u> - and can accept bank transfers - go to <a href=""http://www.hcwa.org.vn"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.hcwa.org.vn</a> for details &lt;3</p>

<p>Hi everyone, my name is Salma Ali. I am a fresh graduate from the faculty of science – Alexandria University finished a major in geophysics and a minor in geology. I have been always seeking to study pure physics, suffering a lot in applying for scholarships and trying to qualify myself with every requirement guaranteed me a place in one of them. NOW I am enraptured to announce that I have been privileged with the opportunity to travel to England starting a course-in-clearing, full-time physics.<br/>I have applied for 5 Universities through UCAS.com and got accepted in three of them with two unconditional and one conditional offer. I have chosen to study at Sheffield Hallam University then directly applied for the Transform Together scholarship which allows me to have a 50% discount on my tuitions fees each year, and I was honoured to be one of the winners for this year. With this being said, there are several costs associated with living and studying there. I am managing to work during my stay, but there are still the costs of my first year needed to be accounted for in order for me to pursue this opportunity while I am working for the next year. My course will begin in September. Below, you will find specifics in regards to the details of costs. Whether you are able to assist or not, I am very appreciative of your continual love and support!</p>

I’m Alissa, an ordinary full-time recruiter at a start-up and part-time English teacher in Thailand whose dream is to open “English Only!” an English language school in Samutprakan province (next to Bangkok).  I have been teaching for about 5 years now:<br/> - 2 years in Thailand at a language school (mostly children, 4 skills, grammar &amp; phonics)<br/>- 1 year in Laos to teens &amp; grown ups (IELTS speaking) <br/>- 6 months in Kyrgyzstan (young teens &amp; grown ups, conversation) <br/>- Almost 1 year online till date (conversation: day to day, business English, presentation &amp; interview)<br/>I have taken the IELTS in 2011 with an overall band of 7 (8.5 in speaking). <br/> I also have a teaching certificate (TESOL) which adds to my expertise in teaching and have been invited to teach corporate English for managerial staff at a company. <br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522129354/gjfbjb55lu3hndsntfhg.jpg"" src=""""/><br/>Below: Taught English at a language school in Thailand. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522120100/elfipiz46yzjwsztpgpi.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Below: Taught English with activities (on this photo, making origami) at a local government school in Thailand.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522120131/mzvzshvg5kc172qmscic.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Below: Taught IELTS speaking at a language school in Laos.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522120179/kxgngi7iqwzzetuhnnnc.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Below: Taught English conversation at a language school in Kyrgyzstan.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522120224/erqgojtbgykfqzmimhek.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Below: Taught Corporate English with senior staff (managers, directors) at a company in Thailand.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522120260/flnixmc6bdx6colg0dwx.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>The Problem</strong><br/>Despite having learned English since grade 1 and taking extra classes during the weekend, the majority of Thai students still lack understanding and fluency in English. Worst of all, they are still shy and afraid to speak English. <br/>According to EF in 2017, Thailand ranks 53rd out of 80 nations in terms of English proficiency which is “low”.  <a href=""https://www.ef.co.th/epi/regions/asia/thailand/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.ef.co.th/epi/regions/asia/thailand/</a> <br/>Why are students unable to speak with so many years of learning? -&gt; They learn the reverse: grammar first. </p><p><strong>The Inspiration:</strong><br/>As someone who calls Thailand her home having been here for over 10 years, I got inspired by my international experience especially in Kyrgyzstan to open up my own language school with a completely new approach in teaching: </p><ul>
<li>    <strong>No text books</strong>! -&gt; Student's won't have to spend extra money on textbooks nor carry them along to every class (as there's none). We mainly use PowerPoint presentations and sometimes other means (realia, videos, songs, illustrations, photos, etc.).</li>
<li>    <strong>No boring grammar</strong> lessons -&gt; Students will learn mental grammar (just how toddlers learn to speak before entering kindergarten)</li>
<li>    <strong>No sitting down/falling asleep throughout the class</strong> -&gt; Lots of fun and engaging group activities and games in English</li>
<li>    <strong>No typical day to day talks only</strong> -&gt; Students will learn idioms &amp; quotes on top of general conversations.</li>
<li>
<strong>Every student gets the chance to talk/say something in English</strong>. In fact, everyone will be asked to at least say something in English in class. No exceptions especially with a class size of maximum 12.</li>
<li>
<strong>No chronology in courses</strong>. Courses are separated by levels and age groups (13+ and below 13). Flexible enrollment where students can join classes anytime without having missed prerequisites because there's none. Those who feel ready to move up the level simply inform the teacher and will take an oral test at their convenient times. </li>
<li>
<strong>Soft skills</strong> on top of English (students will do presentations, debates, singing, negotiations, constructive feedback providing and acting) which can be applied in real life professions. </li>
<li>
<strong>Classroom environment</strong>: home-like, no shoes in class, bean bags &amp; chairs, no tables, lots of empty space for fun activities.</li>
<li>Young, active teachers from different countries with excellent English (not only native English-speakers, we value and promote diversity!). </li>
<li>
<strong>NO Non-English language</strong> within the school area to be spoken or else, the student will be fined 5 Baht per word which goes to their FREE coffee &amp; tea and this rule explains the name of “English Only!”. The only place Thai/non-English is allowed to be spoken is at the reception (Q&amp;A with the receptionist).</li>
<li>
<strong>Social space:</strong> there will be space for socialising in English with a table for tea break, doing homework or playing board games. </li>
</ul><p> The “no non-English” rule sounds harsh, but it has been implemented at the language school I taught in Kyrgyzstan and works like a charm! </p><p><strong>Courses offered: </strong><br/>We focus on speaking &amp; listening mainly so all <strong>group classes</strong> will be based on those 2 skills. For reading &amp; writing, it is encouraged for students to take notes from the presentation by the teachers. <br/><strong>Private classes</strong> are also offered but that will be more of a tutoring style and flexible (according to student's immediate needs) such as preparing for a language proficiency exam like IELTS/TOEFL namely or if they need help with their homework or simply would like to to converse one on one. </p><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong><br/>Ideas, plans and expertise are there. Only the budget is missing. Despite working full-time and part-time, I only get paid so much to cover my rent, utilities, food, transport and very occasional leisure activities.  Taking a loan from the bank or getting venture capitalists to invest are secondary options. I plan to bootstrap my language school where I use minimal resources to run it until it is self-sustainable and I can invest more from what I have self-generated. This means I will be responsible for being both the receptionist (my mother will help me along the way) and the teacher. </p><p>The start-up cost will roughly cost at least 600,000 Baht (about $20,000) and monthly operational costs will cost about 150,000 (about $5000) Baht. As the first one is a minimum cost, I would like to raise up to $10,000 and the rest will be funded from personal budget or other sources of finance. </p><p><strong>What’s in start-up cost?</strong> Few things to name:  <br/>- Machines (printer, computer, projectors, laptop, etc.) <br/>- Furniture (chairs, tables, beanbags, desks, shelves, etc.) <br/>- Renovation (wall painting, flooring, front entrance installment, etc.)<br/>- Long-term marketing materials (Signs, roll-up banners, etc.) </p><p><strong>What’s in monthly operational cost?</strong> Few things to name: <br/>- Rent (this costs 25,000 Baht or about $800)<br/>- Utilities (electricity, Internet, water) <br/>- Salaries (though I plan to be both receptionist and teacher at first with mom’s help, eventually I have to hire someone as we can’t multitask) <br/>- Tax (this is annual but we include that in monthly breakdown) </p><p>If the fund goal is not reached, I will have to keep them to invest in start-up costs like furniture, equipment, etc. To cover other expenses I will have to get loans. This will also mean that opening the school may be delayed by several months.</p><p><strong>How to ensure the business runs? </strong><br/>- <strong>Clear target markets</strong>. Primary target: parents who send kids to learn. Secondary market: teenagers and first jobbers who either want to study abroad or make a better career move.<br/>-<strong> Class size: </strong>I will make sure the class does not exceed 12 students so that everyone gets a chance to speak. This is also a good number when playing activities/games as teams.<br/>-<strong> Strategic location: </strong>I plan to open the school next to the skytrain station so people both from Samutprakan province (which is a heavily residential area) and Bangkok can easily commute.<br/>- I’ve done <strong>market research</strong> with data where I can adjust some of the market needs in the business (e.g. pricing, curriculum, ,marketing channels, etc.) <br/>- I already have a pool of satisfied students who can help with promoting the school as <strong>testimonials</strong><br/>- Marketing though <strong>social media</strong> (Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, LinkedIn) <br/>- <strong>Offline marketing:</strong> exhibiting education fairs, word of mouth, testimonials, etc. (we can’t invest too much in offline marketing at this point) <br/>- <strong>Staff training</strong> (both teachers and receptionists) to ensure high quality service is delivered <br/>- Clear <strong>positioning</strong> and we are at a less competitive position than competitors as we have different teaching methods. <br/>- <strong>Vast options of hours</strong>. As I plan to rent a whole building, not a unit in a shopping mall, I will be able to open classes as early as 7:30am until as late as 10pm. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522429966/qrbwhvkqetzhgl1cc8fv.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522428786/ujwm2p6d2bdru1hnmnlb.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522429767/whmcyio1kekcmbchtm4b.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p><ul>

I’m Alissa, an ordinary full-time recruiter at a start-up and part-time English teacher in Thailand whose dream is to open “English Only!” an English language school in Samutprakan province (next to Bangkok).  I have been teaching for about 5 years now: - 2 years in Thailand at a language school (mostly children, 4 skills, grammar & phonics)- 1 year in Laos to teens & grown ups (IELTS speaking) - 6 months in Kyrgyzstan (young teens & grown ups, conversation) - Almost 1 year online till date (conversation: day to day, business English, presentation & interview)I have taken the IELTS in 2011 with an overall band of 7 (8.5 in speaking).  I also have a teaching certificate (TESOL) which adds to my expertise in teaching and have been invited to teach corporate English for managerial staff at a company. Below: Taught English at a language school in Thailand. Below: Taught English with activities (on this photo, making origami) at a local government school in Thailand.Below: Taught IELTS speaking at a language school in Laos.Below: Taught English conversation at a language school in Kyrgyzstan.Below: Taught Corporate English with senior staff (managers, directors) at a company in Thailand.The ProblemDespite having learned English since grade 1 and taking extra classes during the weekend, the majority of Thai students still lack understanding and fluency in English. Worst of all, they are still shy and afraid to speak English. According to EF in 2017, Thailand ranks 53rd out of 80 nations in terms of English proficiency which is “low”.  https://www.ef.co.th/epi/regions/asia/thailand/ Why are students unable to speak with so many years of learning? -> They learn the reverse: grammar first. The Inspiration:As someone who calls Thailand her home having been here for over 10 years, I got inspired by my international experience especially in Kyrgyzstan to open up my own language school with a completely new approach in teaching: 
    No text books! -> Student's won't have to spend extra money on textbooks nor carry them along to every class (as there's none). We mainly use PowerPoint presentations and sometimes other means (realia, videos, songs, illustrations, photos, etc.).
    No boring grammar lessons -> Students will learn mental grammar (just how toddlers learn to speak before entering kindergarten)
    No sitting down/falling asleep throughout the class -> Lots of fun and engaging group activities and games in English
    No typical day to day talks only -> Students will learn idioms & quotes on top of general conversations.

Every student gets the chance to talk/say something in English. In fact, everyone will be asked to at least say something in English in class. No exceptions especially with a class size of maximum 12.

No chronology in courses. Courses are separated by levels and age groups (13+ and below 13). Flexible enrollment where students can join classes anytime without having missed prerequisites because there's none. Those who feel ready to move up the level simply inform the teacher and will take an oral test at their convenient times. 

Soft skills on top of English (students will do presentations, debates, singing, negotiations, constructive feedback providing and acting) which can be applied in real life professions. 

Classroom environment: home-like, no shoes in class, bean bags & chairs, no tables, lots of empty space for fun activities.
Young, active teachers from different countries with excellent English (not only native English-speakers, we value and promote diversity!). 

NO Non-English language within the school area to be spoken or else, the student will be fined 5 Baht per word which goes to their FREE coffee & tea and this rule explains the name of “English Only!”. The only place Thai/non-English is allowed to be spoken is at the reception (Q&A with the receptionist).

Social space: there will be space for socialising in English with a table for tea break, doing homework or playing board games. 
 The “no non-English” rule sounds harsh, but it has been implemented at the language school I taught in Kyrgyzstan and works like a charm! Courses offered: We focus on speaking & listening mainly so all group classes will be based on those 2 skills. For reading & writing, it is encouraged for students to take notes from the presentation by the teachers. Private classes are also offered but that will be more of a tutoring style and flexible (according to student's immediate needs) such as preparing for a language proficiency exam like IELTS/TOEFL namely or if they need help with their homework or simply would like to to converse one on one. What We Need & What You GetIdeas, plans and expertise are there. Only the budget is missing. Despite working full-time and part-time, I only get paid so much to cover my rent, utilities, food, transport and very occasional leisure activities.  Taking a loan from the bank or getting venture capitalists to invest are secondary options. I plan to bootstrap my language school where I use minimal resources to run it until it is self-sustainable and I can invest more from what I have self-generated. This means I will be responsible for being both the receptionist (my mother will help me along the way) and the teacher. The start-up cost will roughly cost at least 600,000 Baht (about $20,000) and monthly operational costs will cost about 150,000 (about $5000) Baht. As the first one is a minimum cost, I would like to raise up to $10,000 and the rest will be funded from personal budget or other sources of finance. What’s in start-up cost? Few things to name:  - Machines (printer, computer, projectors, laptop, etc.) - Furniture (chairs, tables, beanbags, desks, shelves, etc.) - Renovation (wall painting, flooring, front entrance installment, etc.)- Long-term marketing materials (Signs, roll-up banners, etc.) What’s in monthly operational cost? Few things to name: - Rent (this costs 25,000 Baht or about $800)- Utilities (electricity, Internet, water) - Salaries (though I plan to be both receptionist and teacher at first with mom’s help, eventually I have to hire someone as we can’t multitask) - Tax (this is annual but we include that in monthly breakdown) If the fund goal is not reached, I will have to keep them to invest in start-up costs like furniture, equipment, etc. To cover other expenses I will have to get loans. This will also mean that opening the school may be delayed by several months.How to ensure the business runs? - Clear target markets. Primary target: parents who send kids to learn. Secondary market: teenagers and first jobbers who either want to study abroad or make a better career move.- Class size: I will make sure the class does not exceed 12 students so that everyone gets a chance to speak. This is also a good number when playing activities/games as teams.- Strategic location: I plan to open the school next to the skytrain station so people both from Samutprakan province (which is a heavily residential area) and Bangkok can easily commute.- I’ve done market research with data where I can adjust some of the market needs in the business (e.g. pricing, curriculum, ,marketing channels, etc.) - I already have a pool of satisfied students who can help with promoting the school as testimonials- Marketing though social media (Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, LinkedIn) - Offline marketing: exhibiting education fairs, word of mouth, testimonials, etc. (we can’t invest too much in offline marketing at this point) - Staff training (both teachers and receptionists) to ensure high quality service is delivered - Clear positioning and we are at a less competitive position than competitors as we have different teaching methods. - Vast options of hours. As I plan to rent a whole building, not a unit in a shopping mall, I will be able to open classes as early as 7:30am until as late as 10pm. The Impact
Students have higher chances to study abroad 
Our students who are employees may receive promotions/assigned for business trips/etc. 
Travel lovers won't need guides and can freely travel abroad
More job opportunities for students and those seeking part-time jobs 
More internship opportunities for university students (I will open internship opportunities for interns throughout the year) as the staff work in shifts

<p>No matter where or why you sing, virtual voice coaching might just be
what you need to bring your vocal skills to a higher level. After more than 50
years of singing, teaching and research, Montreal voice teacher Philippe Parent
has teamed up with Wizgo to create a virtual voice application that you can
download to Apple Store and Google Play.</p>
<p>This multimedia tool will include video clips and a multitude of
information for anyone who wants to master the art of singing. It will also be
useful for amateur singers who wish to participate in singing contests anywhere
in the world by simplifying basic technical voice teaching. That's right: you
will be able to practice voice techniques thanks to this innovative software.
No matter where you are, whether at home, on vacation, or even walking on a
sidewalk, the singer in you will be able to apply vocal exercises sent directly
to your iPad or smart phone.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443022521/pqm1ggj3ecpmzaq3hpv1.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 392.56692913385825px; height: 304px;""/></p><i>Philippe Parent, voice teacher since the 1960's, author of vocal <br/>techniques' book  </i><b>LA VOIX AU PRÉSENT</b><i>, creator of the concept of the <br/>Virtual Coach - Learn to sing application.</i>

Do you like to participate in singing contests? Do you see yourself
singing on television? Do you find yourself breaking out in song at your
friends' parties or at karaoke bars? Are you more of a private singer,
delivering your favourite tunes in your living room or in the shower?
No matter where or why you sing, virtual voice coaching might just be
what you need to bring your vocal skills to a higher level. After more than 50
years of singing, teaching and research, Montreal voice teacher Philippe Parent
has teamed up with Wizgo to create a virtual voice application that you can
download to Apple Store and Google Play.
This multimedia tool will include video clips and a multitude of
information for anyone who wants to master the art of singing. It will also be
useful for amateur singers who wish to participate in singing contests anywhere
in the world by simplifying basic technical voice teaching. That's right: you
will be able to practice voice techniques thanks to this innovative software.
No matter where you are, whether at home, on vacation, or even walking on a
sidewalk, the singer in you will be able to apply vocal exercises sent directly
to your iPad or smart phone.Philippe Parent, voice teacher since the 1960's, author of vocal techniques' book  LA VOIX AU PRÉSENT, creator of the concept of the Virtual Coach - Learn to sing application.

</div></div>","Introduction 
I want to establish an ICT Training facility (like the picture above) for youths, women and individuals within and outside the state; to help bridge the digital divide between them and open doors to many under-served youths in my state and beyond.
The Training Centre’s
immediate benefit shall focus on the creation of a better business
competitiveness, jobs creation, investment opportunities, infrastructural
improvements, academic enhancement, global inclusion and participation within the
information society process. The following shall be the main objective of the (proposed) ICT Training Centre:

To bridge the digital divide and open doors to many underserved youths of the state and beyond.
Attaining height in the standard of education for Technology and the creation of new job opportunities and market oriented values using ICT.
Development of a virtual library that provides information and answers urgent questions that meets real economic benefits, impact and social and gender inclusion.
Improving quality of life and creating new opportunities for others who otherwise may not have had the opportunity.  

How Funds Will Be Used The funds gathered from this campaign shall be used for:  Purchase of plots of land
Building construction to accommodate the facilities for this projects
Purchase of Computer Systems, Workstation desks, servers, network cables. Other equipment necessary to set up an ICT Training Centre Purchase of training materials and bills. 
The Training Centre shall be used to conduct Computer-Based Tests for:



Joint Admissions & Matriculation Board (JAMB)


West African Examination Council (WAEC)


National Examination Council (NECO)


Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)


International English Language Testing System (IELTS)


Educational Testing Service (ETS)


Graduate Record Examination (GRE)


SAT (formerly known as Scholastic Aptitude Test, SAT Reasoning Test, etc.)


Profits shall be generated from these examination bodies who would use the centre to conduct their examination biannually, annually or as the case may be. Income realized from these events shall be used in maintaining and upgrading the centre and its facilities, and would also be used in encouraging youths for micro-business startups.

The Impact

 

The project shall
be a Model for other New Millennium ICTs project. It shall enhance the way
people and organizations communicate, exchange knowledge and access
information. The centre shall facilitate the development of:



Entrepreneurship and youth leadership development.


A unifying focus for all tribes, race without discrimination.


A centre that provide a world class and unique
socio-economic, political and Technological development.


The project shall
be a convergence of opportunity for moving people and ideas that maintains a
high quality of life and sustainable development.





Risks/Challenges & Solutions  Since the centre is basically focused on accommodating candidates sitting for Computer-Based Testing (examination), the major challenge here is power in this part of the world. I am going to run an exam for two or three weeks and it must be run on diesel or petrol, which seems to be the cheapest, though technologically, solar energy would be more cheaper than running diesel or petrol in the generator.Another challenge, especially when starting this centre, is getting a place big enough to accommodate whatever I want to do. I need a big place (land) with ample space for parking lot and a holding area because of large crowd where the next batch of candidates can stay before their turn.Yet another challenge is the integrity of the personnel, which I must ascertain. The staff must not compromise. The person in charge of testing the server must be someone of impeccable integrity.
Solutions:
If the software is porous or he's someone who can hack into my database, or who might want to check the results and to change some; there will be problem which will dent the image of the centre. Even if the software person doesn't compromise, another member of staff might do and promise the candidates that they will manipulate for them, which they won't be able to do, but they would have tainted my name and centre. So, I have to be sure of the people I are employing.In CBT, the chances of exam malpractice are minimal and can be traced unlike in Paper & Pencil Testing (PPT). Also, if there is leakage of the exam, the paper can be cancelled immediately and I have another one written. So, if I assign someone trustworthy in place, I won't have anything to worry about.

You will access Groupwise  through desktop or mobile device and compose email with information(events). The information in the email will be accelerated faster than the change in space time into the future and back in time to be received in the present. Like Terminator Genisys, I want to create a company that has a warehouse of servers or with my hardware and software configurations that will allow users to send information(events) back in time to themselves to manipulate their future. But the difference between Genisys and Groupwise is that Groupwise is not self-aware(No AI). The user will make the decision. Groupwise  will also be tied into a server with newsfeed or open source information (events) accelerates email with information (events) faster than change in space time into the future back in time received in the present. Everybody connected to Groupwise on their desktop and mobile device receives an email (early warning of event that will happen). Messages will also be sent to NORAD and the Situation Room. Response based on message can be to acted upon autonomously, semi-autonomously or decision made and responded by humans. But the first step is to fund my email project or project to purchase e-mail server and test it. With your help,  I will do it.</strong>

<strong>2. Travel through hollow core band gap fiber optic cable (97% speed of light and time slows down as it nears the speed of light which allows it to cover more distance).</strong><p></p>
<div>
<strong>3. The distance covered is .1 meter which is done in .000,000,000,333,564,1 seconds=.1m/299,792,458 m/s2 or .2 meter .000,000,000,667,128,19 seconds = .2 meter / 299,792,458 m/s 2.</strong><p><strong>4. All together the small message contracts and  slows as it nears the speed of light which allows it to cover more distance as time slows but in this experiment the distance has been shortened to .1 meter or .2 meter.</strong></p>
</div>
</div></div></div></div>
<p><strong>5. If speed of light is constant, and time slows down as message nears speed of light which allows it to cover more distance but the distance to cover in the experiment is .1 meter or .2 meter (very short) and going near or at the speed of light also causes the small message to contract, what will happen in the experiment to the message with respect to Relativity and Special Relativity? With respect to space time with space on one axis and time on the other axis, the message will be near 97% the speed of light in the hollow core band gap fiber optic cable and with very little space to cover .1 meter .2 meter. Even though the time it takes to cover the distance of .1 m and .2 m is .000,000,000,3 seconds and  .000,000,000,6 seconds, the fact is that the time slowdown and allow the email message that is going near or at the speed of light to cover more distance.</strong></p>
<p><strong>6. If the speed of light is constant and the distance is short (.1 or .2) and time slows which allows more distance to be covered, then 1) the email will arrive in a shorter time since distance is shorter but it does not add up when Time = Distance/ Velocity. If Velocity is 299,72,458 according to Relativity but distance is . 1 m or .2 meters but  although tie equals .000,000,000,3 seconds or .000,000,000,6 seconds  but Special relativity says that time slows for anything that goes near or at the speed of light so the messages time will slow down yet respect Relativity(299,792,458 m/s 2).</strong></p>
<p><strong>7.The message going 299,792,458 m/s 2 time slows down so it covers .1 m in .000,000,000,3 seconds. If speed of light is constant and so is the distance but it shrinks (.1 or .2 shrinks) for the formula T=D/V to remain constant or true then the time must shrink. If the time and distance shrink  then the email message will be closer to the axis of speed of light with little or no space to cover.</strong></p>
<p><strong>8. If time is slowed or close to 0 because the message is traveling at or near the speed of light if the distance is very short (shrunk), can the message travel at the speed of light through the short distance(shrunk) before time moves forward? That is the question of the Experiment. The email is sent through the fiber optic cable form </strong><a href=""mailto:ricardo.gil@sbcglobal.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u><strong>ricardo.gil@sbcglobal.net</strong></u></a><strong> to </strong><a href=""mailto:ricardo.gil@sbcglobal.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u><strong>ricardo.gil@sbcglobal.net</strong></u></a><strong>. The email is going 97% of the seed of light through the hollow core fiber optic cable. Time slows allowing the message to cover more distance but the distance is short .1 m or .2m. It is like a Worm Hole. Except replace surface with time. A TIME WORM HOLE.</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.The impossibility of faster-than-light relative speed only applies locally. Wormholes might allow superluminal (</strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faster-than-light"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u><strong>faster-than-light</strong></u></a><strong>) travel by ensuring that the speed of light is not exceeded locally at any time. While traveling through a wormhole, subluminal (slower-than-light) speeds are used. If two points are connected by a wormhole whose length is shorter than the distance between them <i>outside</i> the wormhole, the time taken to traverse it could be less than the time it would take a light beam to make the journey if it took a path through the space <i>outside</i> the wormhole. However, a light beam traveling through the wormhole would of course beat the traveler.</strong></p>
<p><strong>10. In a Time Worm Hole the time slows down for the email message and the distance is .1 or .2 m which shrinks because the message is near or at the speed of light. The time it takes for the message to be transmitted to self is a lot faster than the time it take for the earth to move in space time even if its not F-T-L.The parallel between the worm hole and the time worm hole is that the worm hole has a shortcut that is space. And the Time Worm Hole is that email sent to self at or near the speed of light  is faster than change in space time of the Earth. The shortcut in Time Worm Hole is time, the time it takes for the email to be sent to self with information is faster (299,792,458 m/s2 ) than the time for the earth to change in space time (30,463 m/s2 ). With respect to Relativity one adds (299,792,458 m/s2 ) and (30,463 m/s2 ) them together  the speed of the email, so the email is going faster than light. (Computer on earth sends email to self).</strong></p>
<p><strong>11. Whether with the fiber optic hollow core band gap version experiment or the CRAY XC 40, theoretically it should work.</strong></p>

If one has the formula time = distance/ velocity then or if velocity is constant speed of light, and distance is .4 m (small distance) and time slows down then the time should also be short at the same time.  (T= .000,000,001 seconds=.4m/299,792,458  m/s 2.)<br/><br/>I am attempting to 2 experiments;<br/><br/>1.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
</div><p>E-MAIL SERVER'S objective is to test email that violates causality(cause and effect) in which  the time it takes for the message to travel equals to that of a message that goes faster than light (send email back in time). I am aware that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. But the hardware and software configuration will allow for a message to be tested and document if the time is equal to that of a message that goes faster than the speed of light or violates causality. (equal to or faster than the speed of light and the email will go back in time). <br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><b>Experiment Explained (Technical yet Simple) Fiber Optic Experiment<br/></b></p>
<p>My hardware and software configuration will allow for a
message to be tested to document if the time is equal to that of a message that
goes faster than the speed of light or violates causality (goes back in time).  This is done
by manipulating the configuration (Length of Pathway of Email Message). </p>
<p>Using the simple formula Time= Distance/ Velocity the time
for a message traveling at the speed of light would be </p>
<p>1m (email pathway)</p>

<p>*(Speed of light in the cable which is refracted is less
than 299,792,458 m/s 2 ). Since the pathway is shorter and the time equals .000,000,002
the speed of the message with pathway of
.4m with velocity or speed of 199,861,638 m/s 2 would be .000,000,002 seconds. It would equal the time
of an email with pathway of 1 meter going in theory 499,654,095 m/s 2 (faster

<p><br/></p><p>Worst case scenario for the experiment with my configuration hardware and software configuration
is that if it does not go faster than light and back in time, the email will be
very fast. The email server with my hardware and software configuration will become a email accelerator.</p><p><b>Experiment Explained (Technical more advanced) Cray Exeperiment<br/></b></p><p></p><p></p><p>Internal Email</p><p>I was talking to a Novell Groupwise Software Engineer and he told me that the pathway of an email sent to self (ricardo.gil@sbcglobal.net to  ricardo.gil@sbcglobal.net) would be internal. So I calculated the speed  of an internal email. It turns out that a Xeon 5 at 3.0 gigahertz will  equal 3.3333333333333 E-10 seconds or .000,000,000,333,333,333,333,33  seconds to send/receive email. Given T=D/V, if the distance were 1  m/299,792,458 m/s2 the time would equal to 3.33564095E-9 seconds or .000,000,003,335,640,95 seconds (speed of light). Since the pathway of the internal email is  less than 1 meter and the time of to send/receive email by Xeon 5 at 3.0 gigaghertz is   .000,000,000,333,333,333,333,33 using T=D/V, If T =  .000,000,000,333,333,333,333,33 seconds then D/V would have a  min(Velocity) of D=.09m/V=299,792,458 m/s2 (equal the speed of light)  and a max(Velocity) of D=.01m/V=333,333,333 m/s2.(Faster than light).  The internal email to self would travel faster than light with one Xeon 5 processor at 3 gigahertz.Simply put the email sent to self would be  sent back in time or violate causality. </p><div>To expand on this configuration one could set up a Cray XC-30 AC that  comes with Linux Suse and install Novell Groupwise and send emails to  self. If 1 cabinet of the Cray had 128 Xeon 5 processor that would be  3.0 gigahertz  128 =384 gigahertz of computing power or send/receive an  email in 2.6041666666667E-12 seconds or .000,000,000,002,604,166,666,666,7 seconds. If one went all out and had the supercomputer configured with  the max or 1024 Xeon processors at 3.0 gigahertz it would send/receive  email at 1024 processors x 3.0 gigahertz=3072 gigahertz. It would take 3.2552083333333E-13 seconds or .000,000,000,000,325,520,833,333,33 seconds to send/receive the email. If the pathway of the internal email were .01 m then the speed of the internal email would be 3,072,056,135  m/s2. (theoretically much faster than the speed of light).<p></p>

</h3><p>If  one were able to move information or matter from one point

there would be some <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frame_of_reference"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>inertial frame
of reference</u></a> in which the signal or object was moving backward in time.
This is a consequence of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>relativity of
simultaneity</u></a> in special relativity, which says that in some cases different
reference frames will disagree on whether two events at different locations
happened ""at the same time"" or not, and they can also disagree on the
order of the two events. Technically, these disagreements occur when the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime_interval"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>space-time interval</u></a>
between the events is 'space-like', meaning that neither event lies in the
future <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_cone"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>light cone</u></a> of the
other. If one of the two events represents the sending of a signal from one
location and the second event represents the reception of the same signal at
another location, then as long as the signal is moving at the speed of light or
slower, the mathematics of simultaneity ensures that all reference frames agree
that the transmission-event happened before the reception-event.</p>
<h3><br/></h3><div>
However, in the case of a hypothetical signal moving faster than 
light, there would always be some frames in which the signal was 
received before it was sent, so that the signal could be said to have 
moved backward in time. And since one of the two fundamental <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postulates_of_special_relativity"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">postulates of special relativity</a>
 says that the laws of physics should work the same way in every 
inertial frame, then if it is possible for signals to move backward in 
time in any one frame, it must be possible in all frames. This means 
that if observer A sends a signal to observer B which moves FTL (faster 
than light) in A's frame but backward in time in B's frame, and then B 
sends a reply which moves FTL in B's frame but backward in time in A's 
frame, it could work out that A receives the reply before sending the 
original signal, a clear violation of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality_%28physics%29"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">causality</a> in <i>every</i> frame.

</div></div>","Update (8/26/2015) Hardware and Software needed for Project/ExperimentUpdate (08/25/2015)  Purchase and Test E-mail Ultimate GoalIn the movie Terminator Genisys,  Genisys is a software that has AI . Access is available through desktop and mobile devices. It is the ultimate goal of my project for an individual to send email back email to oneself using Goupwise  https://www.novell.com/products/groupwise/ . You will access Groupwise  through desktop or mobile device and compose email with information(events). The information in the email will be accelerated faster than the change in space time into the future and back in time to be received in the present. Like Terminator Genisys, I want to create a company that has a warehouse of servers or with my hardware and software configurations that will allow users to send information(events) back in time to themselves to manipulate their future. But the difference between Genisys and Groupwise is that Groupwise is not self-aware(No AI). The user will make the decision. Groupwise  will also be tied into a server with newsfeed or open source information (events) accelerates email with information (events) faster than change in space time into the future back in time received in the present. Everybody connected to Groupwise on their desktop and mobile device receives an email (early warning of event that will happen). Messages will also be sent to NORAD and the Situation Room. Response based on message can be to acted upon autonomously, semi-autonomously or decision made and responded by humans. But the first step is to fund my email project or project to purchase e-mail server and test it. With your help,  I will do it.


Groupwise is like Genisys (Except no AI, only generates email info which contains events or email generated by the user. Email accelerates faster than the Earth's change in space time into the future back in time to be received in the present).GROUP WISE WILL NOTIFY NORAD (EMAIL WILL SERVE AS EARLY WARNING SYSTEM, RESPONSE CAN BE AUTONOMOUS, SEMI-AUTONOMOUS OR RESPONSE CAN BE INITIATED BY HUMANS)



GROUPWISE WILL NOTIFY SITUATION ROOM ON EVENTS AND ALLOW FOR THE US GOVERNMENT TO MANIPULATE THE FUTURE OF THE US IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.Help support my other project too.http://igg.me/at/deaddropserviceUpdate (8/24/2015)Hollow Core Band Gap Fiber Optic Experiment Updated(Technical or more advanced).1. Small message 1 KB  (which also contracts  more as it nears the speed of light).



2. Travel through hollow core band gap fiber optic cable (97% speed of light and time slows down as it nears the speed of light which allows it to cover more distance).

3. The distance covered is .1 meter which is done in .000,000,000,333,564,1 seconds=.1m/299,792,458 m/s2 or .2 meter .000,000,000,667,128,19 seconds = .2 meter / 299,792,458 m/s 2.4. All together the small message contracts and  slows as it nears the speed of light which allows it to cover more distance as time slows but in this experiment the distance has been shortened to .1 meter or .2 meter.


5. If speed of light is constant, and time slows down as message nears speed of light which allows it to cover more distance but the distance to cover in the experiment is .1 meter or .2 meter (very short) and going near or at the speed of light also causes the small message to contract, what will happen in the experiment to the message with respect to Relativity and Special Relativity? With respect to space time with space on one axis and time on the other axis, the message will be near 97% the speed of light in the hollow core band gap fiber optic cable and with very little space to cover .1 meter .2 meter. Even though the time it takes to cover the distance of .1 m and .2 m is .000,000,000,3 seconds and  .000,000,000,6 seconds, the fact is that the time slowdown and allow the email message that is going near or at the speed of light to cover more distance.
6. If the speed of light is constant and the distance is short (.1 or .2) and time slows which allows more distance to be covered, then 1) the email will arrive in a shorter time since distance is shorter but it does not add up when Time = Distance/ Velocity. If Velocity is 299,72,458 according to Relativity but distance is . 1 m or .2 meters but  although tie equals .000,000,000,3 seconds or .000,000,000,6 seconds  but Special relativity says that time slows for anything that goes near or at the speed of light so the messages time will slow down yet respect Relativity(299,792,458 m/s 2).
7.The message going 299,792,458 m/s 2 time slows down so it covers .1 m in .000,000,000,3 seconds. If speed of light is constant and so is the distance but it shrinks (.1 or .2 shrinks) for the formula T=D/V to remain constant or true then the time must shrink. If the time and distance shrink  then the email message will be closer to the axis of speed of light with little or no space to cover.
8. If time is slowed or close to 0 because the message is traveling at or near the speed of light if the distance is very short (shrunk), can the message travel at the speed of light through the short distance(shrunk) before time moves forward? That is the question of the Experiment. The email is sent through the fiber optic cable form ricardo.gil@sbcglobal.net to ricardo.gil@sbcglobal.net. The email is going 97% of the seed of light through the hollow core fiber optic cable. Time slows allowing the message to cover more distance but the distance is short .1 m or .2m. It is like a Worm Hole. Except replace surface with time. A TIME WORM HOLE.
9.The impossibility of faster-than-light relative speed only applies locally. Wormholes might allow superluminal (faster-than-light) travel by ensuring that the speed of light is not exceeded locally at any time. While traveling through a wormhole, subluminal (slower-than-light) speeds are used. If two points are connected by a wormhole whose length is shorter than the distance between them outside the wormhole, the time taken to traverse it could be less than the time it would take a light beam to make the journey if it took a path through the space outside the wormhole. However, a light beam traveling through the wormhole would of course beat the traveler.
10. In a Time Worm Hole the time slows down for the email message and the distance is .1 or .2 m which shrinks because the message is near or at the speed of light. The time it takes for the message to be transmitted to self is a lot faster than the time it take for the earth to move in space time even if its not F-T-L.The parallel between the worm hole and the time worm hole is that the worm hole has a shortcut that is space. And the Time Worm Hole is that email sent to self at or near the speed of light  is faster than change in space time of the Earth. The shortcut in Time Worm Hole is time, the time it takes for the email to be sent to self with information is faster (299,792,458 m/s2 ) than the time for the earth to change in space time (30,463 m/s2 ). With respect to Relativity one adds (299,792,458 m/s2 ) and (30,463 m/s2 ) them together  the speed of the email, so the email is going faster than light. (Computer on earth sends email to self).
11. Whether with the fiber optic hollow core band gap version experiment or the CRAY XC 40, theoretically it should work.


12. Can't sent a Terminator back in time to defeat Skynet right now, but, one could send an email back to change events.


Update (8/22/2015)In my projects the goal is to shorten the distance of the email while it is going near the speed of light or at the speed of light. As a result time slows down(Special Relativity). Speed of light is constant but TIME slows down and allows for greater distance to be covered. What will happen if I reduce the distance of the message? If one has the formula time = distance/ velocity then or if velocity is constant speed of light, and distance is .4 m (small distance) and time slows down then the time should also be short at the same time.  (T= .000,000,001 seconds=.4m/299,792,458  m/s 2.)I am attempting to 2 experiments;1. With fiber optic cable(see gallery)2. Supercomputer with a lot of processors(see gallery).In the test with the fiber optic cable, the peed of light will be 189,000,000 m/s up to  290,798,684 m/s 2. So according to Special relativity the time should slow down as it nears the message reaches near the speed of light.In the test with the supercomputer(see gallery), theoretically the distance the email will go is very small and will be computed at a speed equivalent to  3,072,056,135  m/s2. (theoretically much faster than the speed of light).
Either way the message theoretically will go back or near to going back in time with the fiber optic experiment or in the the Cray experiment, it will actually go back in time.MY THEORY OR HYPOTHESISIn both experiments the message will being going near the speed of light or in the Cray experiment, theoretically much faster. The change in space time of the Earth is 30,463 m/s 2 (rotation of Earth on its axis and Earths orbit around Sun). In the Video, the truck was going 50 mph and the ball tossed between the two kids was 10 mph. But the speed of the ball is 60 mph. Now in my experiments the Earth is moving at 30,463 m/s 2 and the message will be going from 189,000,000 up to 290,798,684 m/s 2  in the fiber optic experiments and in the Cray experiment the email will theoretically will be going 3,072,056,135  m/s2. But if you add the speed of the Earth to both experiments, then the speed of the message will be 297,829,147 m/s 2 ( Near the speed of light/ time slows down)in the fiber optic experiments and in the Cray experiment the message will theoretically be going 3,072,056,598  m/s2. (Faster than the speed of light/ Time goes back)I can only test my experiments if you help fund my project. If not share on Facebook or Tweet your Friends. A share on Facebook or Tweet is good as $. 

Short Summary
E-MAIL SERVER'S objective is to test email that violates causality(cause and effect) in which  the time it takes for the message to travel equals to that of a message that goes faster than light (send email back in time). I am aware that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. But the hardware and software configuration will allow for a message to be tested and document if the time is equal to that of a message that goes faster than the speed of light or violates causality. (equal to or faster than the speed of light and the email will go back in time). Experiment Explained (Technical yet Simple) Fiber Optic Experiment
My hardware and software configuration will allow for a
message to be tested to document if the time is equal to that of a message that
goes faster than the speed of light or violates causality (goes back in time).  This is done
by manipulating the configuration (Length of Pathway of Email Message). 
Using the simple formula Time= Distance/ Velocity the time
for a message traveling at the speed of light would be 
1m (email pathway)

*(Speed of light in the cable which is refracted is less
than 299,792,458 m/s 2 ). Since the pathway is shorter and the time equals .000,000,002
the speed of the message with pathway of
.4m with velocity or speed of 199,861,638 m/s 2 would be .000,000,002 seconds. It would equal the time
of an email with pathway of 1 meter going in theory 499,654,095 m/s 2 (faster
than light/goes back in time).

Worst case scenario for the experiment with my configuration hardware and software configuration
is that if it does not go faster than light and back in time, the email will be
very fast. The email server with my hardware and software configuration will become a email accelerator.Experiment Explained (Technical more advanced) Cray ExeperimentInternal EmailI was talking to a Novell Groupwise Software Engineer and he told me that the pathway of an email sent to self (ricardo.gil@sbcglobal.net to  ricardo.gil@sbcglobal.net) would be internal. So I calculated the speed  of an internal email. It turns out that a Xeon 5 at 3.0 gigahertz will  equal 3.3333333333333 E-10 seconds or .000,000,000,333,333,333,333,33  seconds to send/receive email. Given T=D/V, if the distance were 1  m/299,792,458 m/s2 the time would equal to 3.33564095E-9 seconds or .000,000,003,335,640,95 seconds (speed of light). Since the pathway of the internal email is  less than 1 meter and the time of to send/receive email by Xeon 5 at 3.0 gigaghertz is   .000,000,000,333,333,333,333,33 using T=D/V, If T =  .000,000,000,333,333,333,333,33 seconds then D/V would have a  min(Velocity) of D=.09m/V=299,792,458 m/s2 (equal the speed of light)  and a max(Velocity) of D=.01m/V=333,333,333 m/s2.(Faster than light).  The internal email to self would travel faster than light with one Xeon 5 processor at 3 gigahertz.Simply put the email sent to self would be  sent back in time or violate causality. To expand on this configuration one could set up a Cray XC-30 AC that  comes with Linux Suse and install Novell Groupwise and send emails to  self. If 1 cabinet of the Cray had 128 Xeon 5 processor that would be  3.0 gigahertz  128 =384 gigahertz of computing power or send/receive an  email in 2.6041666666667E-12 seconds or .000,000,000,002,604,166,666,666,7 seconds. If one went all out and had the supercomputer configured with  the max or 1024 Xeon processors at 3.0 gigahertz it would send/receive  email at 1024 processors x 3.0 gigahertz=3072 gigahertz. It would take 3.2552083333333E-13 seconds or .000,000,000,000,325,520,833,333,33 seconds to send/receive the email. If the pathway of the internal email were .01 m then the speed of the internal email would be 3,072,056,135  m/s2. (theoretically much faster than the speed of light).
Faster-than-light (FTL) travel (Background from Wikipedia)


If  one were able to move information or matter from one point
to another faster
than light, then according to the theory of relativity,
there would be some inertial frame
of reference in which the signal or object was moving backward in time.
This is a consequence of the relativity of
simultaneity in special relativity, which says that in some cases different
reference frames will disagree on whether two events at different locations
happened ""at the same time"" or not, and they can also disagree on the
order of the two events. Technically, these disagreements occur when the space-time interval
between the events is 'space-like', meaning that neither event lies in the
future light cone of the
other. If one of the two events represents the sending of a signal from one
location and the second event represents the reception of the same signal at
another location, then as long as the signal is moving at the speed of light or
slower, the mathematics of simultaneity ensures that all reference frames agree
that the transmission-event happened before the reception-event.

However, in the case of a hypothetical signal moving faster than 
light, there would always be some frames in which the signal was 
received before it was sent, so that the signal could be said to have 
moved backward in time. And since one of the two fundamental postulates of special relativity
 says that the laws of physics should work the same way in every 
inertial frame, then if it is possible for signals to move backward in 
time in any one frame, it must be possible in all frames. This means 
that if observer A sends a signal to observer B which moves FTL (faster 
than light) in A's frame but backward in time in B's frame, and then B 
sends a reply which moves FTL in B's frame but backward in time in A's 
frame, it could work out that A receives the reply before sending the 
original signal, a clear violation of causality in every frame. An illustration of such a scenario using space-time diagrams can be found here.The scenario is sometimes referred to as a tachyonic antitelephone.
   



What We Need 
 I need funding for:
Hardware and software  $10,000
Hardware Consultant $1,000 and Software Consultant $1,000

  The Impact The impact will not be  trying  to violate any laws of physics. The goal or objective is to test whether the hardware configuration will allow the email to travel in the amount of time that it equals to the speed of light or faster than the speed of light.  I acknowledge that the laws of physics state that the speed limit is the speed of light. But, I believe my configuration will equal to the time of the speed of light or faster than the speed of light which will violate causality (email will be logged or  documented in sent/received box and go back in time).  Challenges  The biggest challenge is getting funded to test the project.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Ariel McCasland; I am a professional nanny and Reiki master. I am seeking help in funding my training to become a doula. Currently in the United States, about 1 in 3 American babies are born via cesarean. And, according to a 2017 Consumer Reports study, about 26 percent of healthy women with low-risk pregnancies and full-term babies positioned headfirst— and therefore typically considered equipped to deliver vaginally—end up undergoing c-sections. In other words, our current system for maternal care regularly fails women, stripping them of their autonomy, and leaving birth workers caught in its grinders burnt out. We need a new frame work. I believe Angela Gallo's Dynamo Doula Training teaches the vision and the skills to bring about a revolution of radical compassion and a rebirth of how we care for mothers and their families as they transition into the new stage of parenthood. It is vital. Please help me get this information to the United States, especially the South East, where I live. This training course covers everything from fertilization to birth trauma and how to help through the postpartum (4th trimester) stage. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The Dynamo Doula Training program costs 2,999 Australian Dollars; so I am asking for</p>
<p>$2,050 American dollars,</p>
<p>which is based on the current exchange rate. I will be sending it all to the program, which is a 24 week program that begins November 1st. I must complete the program within that 24 weeks to get certified. This means proof of your contribution will come quickly as I keep everyone posted on my progress. </p>
<ul>
<li>Those that contribute $400 or more, I will paint a commissioned piece for them. (I paint floor monsters and dinosaurs; Pictures of them will be on the perks page.)</li>
<li>If I do not meet my entire goal by November 1st. I will put the money into a savings account and continue saving until I have the full amount. I will then take the course the next time they open enrollment (the following November 1st). </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This shift in how we care for mothers and how birth workers are trained is imperative. We must bring humanity back to this right of passage. I will manage to save the money eventually with or without hope; contributing will enable me to get this training more quickly and bring this needed vision to the United States. I finish projects that I start. I graduated Summa Cum laude from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville with a B.A. in Psychology. I studied Reiki, rather than go to grad-school, because our models of medicine are flawed. We rely too much on medicine instead of harnessing our own abilities to heal and to experience growth/post-traumatic growth. This is the next step in my personal evolution and me living out my purpose of bringing necesary change to our medical systems, through healing and radical compassio</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The challenge is I need to have the full amount $2,050 by November 1st in order to enroll, or I will have to wait another year before enrolling. I will put the money into a separate savings account at a credit union if I do not meet my goal. With what I do manage to collect, I will have the rest saved by next enrollment. I am passionate and driven to get this training!</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Imagine yourself living in a place where is no electricity and water,<br/>So not having Facebook is just a starter.<br/>It’s Monday morning 8 o’ clock,<br/>With no breakfast in stock.</p>
<p>A glass of water would be so nice,<br/>But over here it’s no paradise.<br/>So you grab your jerrycan and put it on your head,<br/>Walking for 10 k is better than having nothing instead.</p>
<p>On the road you meet a girl going to school,<br/>But in your house that’s not the rule.<br/>As your mum left this world being way too young,<br/>Tries father with HIV to remain strong.<br/>While it’s hard to understand why,<br/>There is not much time for you to cry.<br/>Work on the land needs to be done,<br/>So school is not a place you seem to belong. </p>
<p>Meanwhile it’s already late,<br/>So you have to go to the garden straight.<br/>Harvesting maize is your activity of the day,<br/>Trying not to think of food along the way.</p>
<p>After 4 hours working in the heat,<br/>It’s finally time for your treat.<br/>Here is your breakfast, lunch and dinner in one time,<br/>Two potatoes everyday is just fine.</p>
<p>Becoming a pilot is what you dream about,<br/>But without going to school it’s hard to say out loud.<br/>So you’re heading to the school you saw today,<br/>And wish you could be like them and play.</p>
<p>Where this seems to be impossible for you,<br/>Is that certainly not true.<br/>In Maris Junior School there is place for all the poor,<br/>They just need to expand a little more.</p>
<p>A second building is in the make,<br/>However, 7.000 euros is what it’s going to take.<br/><br/>Now imagine yourself on a Friday night,<br/>You probably go for a drink or a bite.<br/>When you had your beer and want some more.<br/>Please, just order three instead of four.<br/>And give the saving of the night,<br/>To one of the buttons on the right.</p>

Meanwhile it’s already late,So you have to go to the garden straight.Harvesting maize is your activity of the day,Trying not to think of food along the way.
After 4 hours working in the heat,It’s finally time for your treat.Here is your breakfast, lunch and dinner in one time,Two potatoes everyday is just fine.
Becoming a pilot is what you dream about,But without going to school it’s hard to say out loud.So you’re heading to the school you saw today,And wish you could be like them and play.
Where this seems to be impossible for you,Is that certainly not true.In Maris Junior School there is place for all the poor,They just need to expand a little more.
A second building is in the make,However, 7.000 euros is what it’s going to take.Now imagine yourself on a Friday night,You probably go for a drink or a bite.When you had your beer and want some more.Please, just order three instead of four.And give the saving of the night,To one of the buttons on the right.

<h3>Why this theme?</h3>
<p>Each sensitive and thoughtful person must consider, how it is possible that in the <strong>XXI century</strong>, there are <strong>still</strong> <strong>circumcised </strong>boys and girls in traditional societies in extreme <strong>unsanitary conditions</strong>, what throughout immense<strong> suffering </strong>often leads to serious postoperative<strong> complications </strong>and frequently to <strong>death</strong>. E.g., in 2013, only in one province in the South Africa Republic, 30 young people was dead, while near 300 had to be hospitalized after tribal circumcision season (the press report see <a href=""http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/07/07/30-south-african-men-killed-in-ritual-circumcision.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>).<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479914326/ns9urm3jgmu24ut6d9fg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>What is also intriguing, this rituals are usually the <strong>most solemn and important </strong>festivity for the societies involved, so even <strong>highly educated</strong> members of the societies often oppose toward abandon these rituals because they treat them as the feature of community's <strong>ethnic identity</strong>. Also, there are the <strong>Jewish circumcision</strong>,<strong> Islamic</strong> one, and modern <strong>medico-hygienic </strong>form of it (particularly in US, Canada, UK, and Australia), and there are not quite clear <strong>links</strong> between all these forms. This is what was an incentive to investigate the case.</p>

<h3>What Will Be Done?</h3>
<p>The research will show that the <strong>genesis </strong>of ritual circumcision should be <strong>dated back </strong>by many millennia and the rituals must be included to the<strong> oldest rituals</strong> of man.

<div>Let us tell you a story. Two girls from Pakistan saved up for a year &amp; decided to finally tick ""Travel the world"" off their bucket lists &amp; bought a ticket to another country. With our itinerary prepared &amp; destinations decided, we hopped on the plane, excited to have the time of our lives. We reached the destined country, settled in &amp; headed out to sight seeing. We spoke to a few people on the way to get directions and we were asked one question every time: ""Where are you from?"" ""Pakistan"" was our chirpy response. There would be a confused look on their faces. ""Really, how do you speak English so well?"", ""Are girls in Pakistan allowed to go out?!"" etc. We were taken aback initially, however, we decided to grab the opportunity &amp; become the ambassadors of our country.  We had lively conversations with people and they were amazed to know of life in Pakistan. Some of them even expressed a wish to visit us when we go back!</div>
<div>When we returned, we pondered over our experience &amp; the negative image of Pakistan that is being portrayed to the world. </div>
<div>When we spoke to people around us, we realized even within Pakistan, people are not much hopeful. We went out to speak to people on the roads, in schools, shopping malls; we spoke to hawkers, shopkeepers, taxi drivers; most of them had the similar response, ""<i>Pakistan mein tou aese hi hota hai"" </i>(This what happens &amp; will keep on happening in Pakistan). This hit us harder, to know our own people are so hopeless. This made us realize that the negativity is inherent within us, it's claws are strongly dug within our minds, we need to change our own perspective before we venture out to change the outside world's.</div>
<div>Living in Pakistan means facing a series of never-ending contradictions. There is the innate hopefulness of the future yet the hopelessness of the surroundings; there is the passion to defy the odds yet the fear of the conservative society; there is the urge to explore life yet the terror of religious extremism; despite all this, the country strives on. </div>

</div>
<div>Pakistan is an enigma to many and a tragedy to some. But can you imagine the resilience and the courage of the people living here who had all the reasons to give up but never did; that's what we want to share with the world. </div>

People say Pakistan has no facilities for the disabled but little do they know
that there are many
hidden stories of courage and resilience spread throughout Pakistan where
people have overcome their disabilities
and have become great achievers. People in urban areas suffer from water

</ul><p></p></div>","The Untold Story of Pakistan
Let us tell you a story. Two girls from Pakistan saved up for a year & decided to finally tick ""Travel the world"" off their bucket lists & bought a ticket to another country. With our itinerary prepared & destinations decided, we hopped on the plane, excited to have the time of our lives. We reached the destined country, settled in & headed out to sight seeing. We spoke to a few people on the way to get directions and we were asked one question every time: ""Where are you from?"" ""Pakistan"" was our chirpy response. There would be a confused look on their faces. ""Really, how do you speak English so well?"", ""Are girls in Pakistan allowed to go out?!"" etc. We were taken aback initially, however, we decided to grab the opportunity & become the ambassadors of our country.  We had lively conversations with people and they were amazed to know of life in Pakistan. Some of them even expressed a wish to visit us when we go back!
When we returned, we pondered over our experience & the negative image of Pakistan that is being portrayed to the world. 
When we spoke to people around us, we realized even within Pakistan, people are not much hopeful. We went out to speak to people on the roads, in schools, shopping malls; we spoke to hawkers, shopkeepers, taxi drivers; most of them had the similar response, ""Pakistan mein tou aese hi hota hai"" (This what happens & will keep on happening in Pakistan). This hit us harder, to know our own people are so hopeless. This made us realize that the negativity is inherent within us, it's claws are strongly dug within our minds, we need to change our own perspective before we venture out to change the outside world's.
Living in Pakistan means facing a series of never-ending contradictions. There is the innate hopefulness of the future yet the hopelessness of the surroundings; there is the passion to defy the odds yet the fear of the conservative society; there is the urge to explore life yet the terror of religious extremism; despite all this, the country strives on. 

Isn't it unfair to term a nation of 191,316,136 people as being extremists, conservatives & (hurts to even mention) terrorists? Yes, Pakistan is facing a lot of challenges today, but this is also our reality:




Pakistan is ranked among the least racist countries of the world
Pakistan hosts the largest number of refugees in the world
Pakistan is the largest contributor to UN Peacekeeping mission 



Pakistan is an enigma to many and a tragedy to some. But can you imagine the resilience and the courage of the people living here who had all the reasons to give up but never did; that's what we want to share with the world. 
We are a team on 3 very proud Pakistani girls & we wish to bring to front the unsung heroes, who within their capacity are overcoming all hindrances and making this world a better place for themselves and others. 



What is Mera Passion Pakistan (MPP)?

MPP is a digital media initiative conceived and implemented to highlight success stories of citizens belonging to a humble background - stories of their courage, integrity, innovation & resolution. 
MPP's team constantly searches for heroes, records their achievements and shares them on social media to:

Change perspectives
Showcase stories of optimism
Nurture role-models
Inspire positive action&
Transform the way the world sees Pakistan


How Did Mera Passion Pakistan Start?

Great things always begin with visionaries...MPP was envisioned by Irfan Mustafa, a corporate titan, philanthropist and a true patriot at heart. He was named as one of the Pakistan Power 100. On his extensive travels around the world, the negative image of Pakistan which was being portrayed around the world, bothered him. He started Mera Passion Pakistan & entrusted the School of Leadership with the task. He invested the seed money which helped the team in gaining ground.  



How We See Pakistan?


People think we clip our children’s
wings and don’t let them soar high. These people do not know the story of a
visionary man from Kyber PakhtunKhwa, who despite being a motor mechanic, has built a plane!
People say Pakistan has no facilities for the disabled but little do they know
that there are many
hidden stories of courage and resilience spread throughout Pakistan where
people have overcome their disabilities
and have become great achievers. People in urban areas suffer from water
shortage, whereas there are people in the northern areas who took it upon
themselves and set up Hydroelectric
Power Plants. 
See their stories here:

<p>The 18:00 response delay is no one's fault. It's due to lack of information, the inherent chaos of an active shooting event, the inability for someone at the scene to call 911, human uncertainty as to what they just heard, and many other factors.</p>
<p>Guardian technology reduces the emergency response time from 18 minutes to just a few. That saves lives. But it's not just the emergency response teams that get notified. It notifies the school's leadership, administration, and teachers immediately so they know a shot was fired and exactly where it was fired within the school. </p>
<p>Many schools currently utilize active shooter training programs that teach ""Run, Hide, Fight."" Guardian's immediate and accurate information initiates these procedures with teachers and school officials much more quickly, saving lives.</p>

<strong>ERASE</strong> was a participatory memorial art installation launched in September, 2013 at the ArtPrize festival in Grand Rapids, MI. It started with the hand-drawing of a 20ft long AR-15 rifle and ended with exhibit participants erasing pieces of the rifle. Each eraser was hand-stamped with the name and age of a victim from the Columbine, Virginia Tech, Aurora and Newtown massacres. The recreation of this art installation will provide our crowdfunding campaign with a very powerful and quite relevant emotional experience. Tickets to the event will be available as one of our “perks” on Indiegogo.<p><br/></p>

Guardian knows instantly that it was, indeed, a gunshot, which sets the communication in motion to emergency responders and school staff. It's all about ""erasing"" time.










Over $45 million dollars of research and development has been invested by the US Government and a defense contractor to mature this capability. The technology has saved the lives of countless military men and women overseas.

$20,000 = 1 school

It started with the hand-drawing of a 20ft long AR-15 rifle and ended with exhibit participants erasing pieces of the rifle. Each eraser was hand-stamped with the name and age of a victim from the Columbine, Virginia Tech, Aurora and Newtown massacres. The recreation of this art installation will provide our crowdfunding campaign with a very powerful and quite relevant emotional experience. Tickets to the event will be available as one of our “perks” on Indiegogo.

<p><em>Let's help High School students find their passions by involving the community in their education</em>. </p><p>There are over <strong>600,000 </strong>college students in Chicago alone. Many of these
students are building skills and understanding in their own field; choosing a
major in order to focus their efforts on a passionate career. Why not use the
resource of higher education <strong>to advance the instruction</strong> and success of those in
high school? The talented and driven minds of thousands of college students can
help raise the achievement of the engaged, the bored, the motivated, and the struggling.
</p>
<p>With Advance Chicago,<strong> students can absorb subjects that captivate them</strong>.
Subjects they had no way of experiencing with traditional classroom
lessons, especially with today’s standards based curriculum. Advance
Chicago helps to create a learning environment that is built by the interests

<p>Students at local Chicago universities visit the Advance Chicago website and
submit an online registration with information about their background in

student's category of topic to lead lessons at local High Schools. </p>
<p>Meanwhile at a local High School, students have expressed interests to the Advance
Chicago facilitator (a teacher at the local High School who helps provide

it's like to produce music, and some wanted to know what being chef is all

These bedtime stories about animals coming together for a festival in nature evolved into a short story called “Pachamama’s Pajamas.” When Dave and Aaron came together around the vision of a healthy and resilient world in a dynamic, ever evolving balance, they re-wrote the story to focus on the little girl Pacha who showed up at the end of the original story.<br/><br/>Our first several years were focused on creating a rich, multimedia tapestry for this children's story about our connectedness. The final incarnation co-authored by Dave and Aaron - <i>Pacha’s Pajamas: A Story Written By Nature </i>- was published by Morgan James in April 2016.

The Pacha’s Pajamas double album has won a total of nine awards including People’s Choice for Best Children’s Music in the Independent Music Awards, the Eco-Arts award for best songwriting, and the Academics Choice Smart Media award.   
 Up until the last few years, only 1.5% of children’s books were about African American or Latino characters and only roughly 31% having female central characters. Pacha’s Pajamas helps correct this underrepresentation by presenting a female whose family is Peruvian American of African, European, and Native descent. In fact, her background plays a huge part of the storyline as she explores the world of Pachamama (The Incan Mother Nature). When Pacha awakens from her dream adventure, she feels called to spread the message from her dream - that We Are ALL Connected - to the world. She has initiated an internet dance challenge - the Connected Dance Challenge, which invites kids to submit videos of themselves doing the Connected Dance for the chance to win prizes and to be in a dance video with kids around the world. 

This is our first Pacha’s Pajamas Webisode. It presents the beginning of the story up to the point that Pacha gets her magical pajamas.  and features Mos Def aka Yasiin Bey as the narrator, Genevieve Goings as Mama, and Ta’Kaiya Blaney as Pacha.  Stay tuned for the second webisode!

 The mission of Pacha’s Pajamas is to translate ancient ways of seeing our relationships with nature, one another, and ourselves into the language of today’s kids, with the intention to inspire tens of millions of young people to become leaders and create the world they want to live in. We do this with culturally relevant characters and locales, engaging stories that remind, eye-catching illustrations, and uses of augmented reality technology that inspire, engage, and educate.The idea for Pacha’s Pajamas came to our co-founder Aaron Ableman as he told his younger brother bedtime stories. These bedtime stories about animals coming together for a festival in nature evolved into a short story called “Pachamama’s Pajamas.” When Dave and Aaron came together around the vision of a healthy and resilient world in a dynamic, ever evolving balance, they re-wrote the story to focus on the little girl Pacha who showed up at the end of the original story.Our first several years were focused on creating a rich, multimedia tapestry for this children's story about our connectedness. The final incarnation co-authored by Dave and Aaron - Pacha’s Pajamas: A Story Written By Nature - was published by Morgan James in April 2016. The augmented reality app was completed in October 2016. In June 2017, the book received the award for Book of the Year in the Augmented Reality category of the Foreword Indies Awards.  People often ask us how can they help. Usually, unless they have some very specific skills that we need at that moment, it can be challenging to find a short-term meaningful project for people to do. But it just so happens that right about now, we've got some amazing things that those of you who want to help can do! And it will make a huge difference right now. Allow us to leverage your social network to spread the word far and wide about Pacha and her movement for people to realize we are all connected.

It is a perfect way to introduce kids to nature, animals and plants, environmental issues, mindfulness, how to be a force for good and create a better world, how other kids live, and social and emotional learning.Q: How do the music and dance elements help my child?A: Studies show that dance and music are great for physical expression and emotional regulation.Q: Where is Aaron Ableman?A:  Aaron Ableman has moved on from his work with BALANCE/Pacha's Pajamas to forge a career in the music, film and TV industry. He is producing an exciting new brand entitled ""Alive & Awake""! A quest for the meaning of life, ""Alive & Awake"" celebrates every young person's yearning to tackle big challenges through the power of creativity. Leading with the album (17 songs, 8 stories, and 3 music videos), Aaron is pioneering a new means of distributing the content: a downloadable album on the back of a tree kit of ethically-sourced tree seedlings. This is the world's first plantable music album. Youth 7 + will get an album (companion booklet inside) along with each tree kit to plant in their school communities. Plus, for every album/tree purchased, one is planted in a developing nation.",42.0,10,"5 Campaigns

Learning
Studying, concentration, creativity...and do you want to use your brain to its maximum potential capacity? 
Try out the high-alpha wave.
Before using the super brain (almost no alpha wave)

five minutes after using the super brain (rapidly increased alpha wave status)

REX Super brain is crafted based on Dr. Robert O. Becker’s theory that both human beings and animals significantly react to the magnetic field.
Super brain stimulates the brain wave by producing a specific harmless magnetic field from the main device to head band and creating high alpha wave, low alpha wave theta wave, and wave of delta wave
Even Albert Einstein, known as the biggest genius of all time, could not use his brain to the full potential.    
Then how can a human being use his/her brain to the maximum capability? 
The answer is in transforming the brain wave to alpha wave with the power of science. 
 Once the brain wave is changed into alpha wave with science.. it is easier to extract the unlimited potential that a brain has.. The brain of a human being, when the brain wave turns into alpha wave.. extracting the limitless hidden capability that was given by god is possible.
 When a brain wave becomes an alpha wave, not only concentration, creativity, studying capability, and memory power significantly develops but also mental stress goes away and peace in mind is created.
 A status that the brain is extremely active and studying capability, intuition, and creativity is increased to the maximum, is the alpha wave status.  
When the brain wave is in alpha wave status, the brain can demonstrate the maximum potential capability and when the brain wave changes into theta wave, brain goes into a sleeping mode.  
In a normal situation, human being’s brain wave is in beta wave status. If the brain wave is in beta wave, tension, agitation, anxiety and worries accumulate, and with such mental stress, they often damage your body and mind.  
However, once the brain wave turns into alpha wave, anti-stress hormone called beta-endorphin increases two to three times.
 As a result, it is scientifically known that the mental stress quickly goes away.    
And the brain wave turns into slow alpha wave and the brain enters the meditation status. 
The alpha status of brain is the best status for an ideal life of a human being. 
Therefore, no matter Western or Asian, the purpose of all meditation practices is about changing the brain wave to alpha wave. 
However, it is extremely difficult to freely control and get to such active status of the brain. 
Therefore, the research on how to reach the alpha status whenever we want to in a short amount of period has been practiced from long time ago. 
After different endeavors, several products were invented. Some of them, even though it is weak, actually succeeded in activating the brain.  Nevertheless, all of them use the method of stimulating either the user’s hearing or sight.  
Super brain has an outstanding efficiency because it stimulates the brain wave by creating a specific frequency wave in safe and harmless.

Afri Black
Community (ABC) Contributions 2015:
Problem: The main problem
we see is that the Computers, Lab Space and primary function for the
intent of a school having a Computer Lab to improve their computer literacy skills and basic skills learning is underutilized. The Computer Lab needs necessary updates, repairs and
proper ongoing maintenance, and qualified Help-Desk Staff available to
oversee the lab properly. 
Afri Black thus far
has already: 
·  Re-arranged the
entire layout of the facility
·  Purchased and
installed some of the network wire cables
·  Ordered New Ceiling
Fans (electrical needs rewiring again termites destroyed wires) Computers need
proper ventilation to function
·  Contracted a
professional Gambian Electrician to do the rewiring maintenance and updates
·  Contracted a
professional Gambian Networking Engineer (Cisco Certified, BS Computer Science)
·  Have 1 Server but
need another more updated Server with enough RAM/ memory to carry at least 30 Computers
·  Have 1 Switch but
not enough ports to carry 30 PCs
·  Teacher Training-“Basic
Computing & Instructional and Technical Design for Teachers”
·  Acquired 5 Qualified Volunteers
ICT Instructors 

NEED:
·  Cable wiring, to
complete the entire network capacity
·  We need to
refurbish and update the Electrical Wiring of the Computer Lab
·  We need Solar
Panels and a Solar Generator, or a Fuel Generator
·  We are still in
need of Routers, Switches, and Children Learning Software
·  Painting
·  Window Repairs (Rain Comes Inside the Computer Lab)
Impact: Afri Black is transforming
this space into a proper ""Computer Learning Resource Center"" to help
in Closing the Gap of The Digital Divide that this school and community is
experiencing, and to help to improve and enhance Computer Literacy of Bijilo
Lower Basic School Students, Young Adults, Teachers and the Local Bijilo Community
in The Gambia. 
Current Status: Needs Serious Upgrades/Fixtures/Repairs/and Expansion/

So many of my patients had the same problem: </div><div>
<b>You exercise, eat well but for some reason, you just can't shed those extra pounds. Sound familiar?</b>
</div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">The problem is that </span><b style=""background-color: initial;""><i>not every diet works for every person. </i></b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><i>How do you say one size fits all?</i></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span>
</div><div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I wanted to help my patients lose weight but I knew it had to be customized to each person's specific needs. </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">So I found the secret in sweat.</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">There's lots of things that come out in your sweat that give physicians a clue as to what's going on in your body, including </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">how your body processes food and </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">what you should eat and what you should avoid. So I created a way for people to test their sweat at home.</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">It's called <b><i>FUELSTRIP</i></b>. Here's how it works. First, work up a sweat.</span>
</div><div>
<p>Once you're at that point where you're feeling the fatigue and you're sweating, wipe it across your forehead. There's a little square at the end and it will change to one of three colors - <span style=""color: #F05023!important; font-weight: bold;"">orange,</span> <span style=""color: #76BC43!important; font-weight: bold;"">green,</span> or <span style=""color: #F6BF17!important; font-weight: bold;"">yellow</span>. </p>
<p>Our clients all receive a detailed meal plan but in general, <span style=""color: #F05023!important; font-weight: bold;"">Orange</span> means low carb, <span style=""color: #76BC43!important; font-weight: bold;"">Green</span> low fat, and <span style=""color: #F6BF17!important; font-weight: bold;"">Yellow</span><b> </b>is a combination of both. </p>
<p>But from my years of experience I knew that customizing your diet to your unique body was not enough.  My patients still needed a way to keep to their custom diet and avoid those carb cravings. So I searched the globe for the top all-natural fat burning botanicals and combined the top 13 weight loss ingredients into one delicious 10 calorie drink called <b>FUELSLIM </b>.</p>
<p><b>Hundreds of people have lost significant amounts of weight quickly by drinking FUELSLIM twice a day</b> and following their custom body type diet. But their testimonials are not enough. I need your help to conduct the first ever university study on the amazing results we have seen thus far with the FUELSTRIP body type dieting system by studying our system head-to-head compared with some of the other (sometimes dangerous) prescription based weight loss programs. FUELSTRIP is so important that I have made it my life's work. With your help we can help millions of people finally lose weight and become healthy again. </p>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Goal 1: </b>$10,000<b style=""font-weight: bold;""> - </b>A full scale independent university group study on the benefits of the FUELSTRIP and customized body type dieting and it's effect on weight loss as compared to other prescription weight loss programs. Testing will include not only weight loss but also ""Before &amp; After"" of other important health markers and physiological functions. <br/><br/><b>Stretch Goal</b>:  $70,000 - Experiment 2:  First ever university group study on the FUELSTRIP customized body type weight loss program in conjunction with drinking the FUELSLIM Fit Body Drink twice a day and its effects on weight loss over a 6 to 8 week period.<br/></p>

<h3 style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Please tell me more about Dr. Bo?</span></h3>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Dr. Bo Rosenblat is a nationally recognized, board-certified physician with more than 15 years of experience. As the creator and medical director of FUELSTRIP, he has personally formulated all of our nutritional products, weight loss formulas, diets, and workouts. He is also the creator of our proprietary Fuelstrips that provide a custom metabolic profile of your body simply by swiping the test strip with your sweat. <br/><br/>Famously, Dr. Bo is also Chief Physician for Dr. Bo's Diet Center, responsible for overseeing the medical staff of doctors, physician assistants and nurse practitioners. He is also Chief Emergency Physician at Memorial Healthcare System in South Florida. <br/><br/>As the founder of FUELSTRIP, Dr. Bo, together with his team of Nutritionists and Dietitians, is constantly researching the latest scientific advancements for obesity-related disease and weight management. Dr. Bo has written articles on numerous medical topics for scientific journals, newspapers, magazines as well as internet blogs and websites. <br/><br/>Dr. Bo has served in many leadership positions in hospitals and clinics, and has lectured for physician organizations all across the United States.</p>
<p></p>
<h2></h2>
<h3><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">How does the FUELSTRIP work?</i></h3>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Your body has 3 options to fuel its activity. Depending on your body type and the intensity of your activity it will select between fat, sugar and muscle. Each of these fuel sources has a unique metabolite that is released into the sweat. By testing your sweat for these byproducts after a light workout we can determine what fuel source your body naturally burns. This is key to understanding the best way to feed your body.</p>
<h3><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">Why is it important to analyze your sweat?</i></h3>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>When you go to a doctor she examines you and checks your blood work to see what the best treatment options are. He doesn’t prescribe the same pill for all his patients regardless of who they are. When trying to lose weight there is a lot more than calorie counting. The types of food you eat, the timing of your meals, and keeping your blood sugars level all play an important part. There isn’t one best solution for everyone. Depending on your unique genetics and body type different solutions will work better for you. Test your sweat to find out what body type you are and which diet will work for you.</p>
<h3><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">What is in FUELSLIM Fit Drink?</i></h3>
<p>FUELSLIM Fit Drink is the all-natural and delicious way to lose weight and keep it off.

<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><i>What kind of diet would help me lose weight?</i></span></h3>
<p>Good question. Our extensive medical research has shown that there is not one diet program that will work for everyone. Your body is unique. Some people can tolerate healthy fats in their diet and burn it without difficulty, while others seem to consume fatty food and can’t metabolize it well. So our doctors created Fuelstrips – simply do our assessment workout, swipe your sweat on our test strips, and you will be able to create a simple customized diet program that will match your body (for more information please refer to your weight loss meal plan).</p>

<h3><br/></h3></div>","STEP 1
How it Works

Our simple to use sweat test strips allow you to easily figure out what ""body type"" you are.  Knowing if your body tends to burn fat or sugar will allow you to follow a diet that is best suited for you.  Your weight loss will be more targeted to fat with overall better cosmetic results.




STEP 2

A Custom Meal Plan Unique For Your Body

There are 3 different meal plans that are geared to the results of your test strip.  The Orange plan is a low carb diet that allows healthy fats such as nuts, and avocados.  The Green plan is a low fat diet that allows plenty of healthy carbs but avoids fats.  The Yellow plan is a balanced carb/fat diet.




STEP 3
Drink FUELSLIM

While the Fuelstrips allow you to customize your food based on your body's natural design, our FUELSLIM Fit Body Drink makes the process easier than you can imagine.  Imagine losing weight without the hunger, and targeting your excess fat at the same time.  Filled with vitamins, superfruits and antioxidants your body will reap the health benefits of this revolutionary superdrink.






ABOUT FUELSTRIP 

My name is Dr. Bo Rosenblat, and I have counseled thousands of weight loss patients at Dr. Bo's weight loss clinics nationally and abroad. So many of my patients had the same problem: 
You exercise, eat well but for some reason, you just can't shed those extra pounds. Sound familiar?


The problem is that not every diet works for every person. How do you say one size fits all? 

I wanted to help my patients lose weight but I knew it had to be customized to each person's specific needs. So I found the secret in sweat.There's lots of things that come out in your sweat that give physicians a clue as to what's going on in your body, including how your body processes food and what you should eat and what you should avoid. So I created a way for people to test their sweat at home.It's called FUELSTRIP. Here's how it works. First, work up a sweat.

Once you're at that point where you're feeling the fatigue and you're sweating, wipe it across your forehead. There's a little square at the end and it will change to one of three colors - orange, green, or yellow. 
Our clients all receive a detailed meal plan but in general, Orange means low carb, Green low fat, and Yellow is a combination of both. 
But from my years of experience I knew that customizing your diet to your unique body was not enough.  My patients still needed a way to keep to their custom diet and avoid those carb cravings. So I searched the globe for the top all-natural fat burning botanicals and combined the top 13 weight loss ingredients into one delicious 10 calorie drink called FUELSLIM .
Hundreds of people have lost significant amounts of weight quickly by drinking FUELSLIM twice a day and following their custom body type diet. But their testimonials are not enough. I need your help to conduct the first ever university study on the amazing results we have seen thus far with the FUELSTRIP body type dieting system by studying our system head-to-head compared with some of the other (sometimes dangerous) prescription based weight loss programs. FUELSTRIP is so important that I have made it my life's work. With your help we can help millions of people finally lose weight and become healthy again. 
Goal 1: $10,000 - A full scale independent university group study on the benefits of the FUELSTRIP and customized body type dieting and it's effect on weight loss as compared to other prescription weight loss programs. Testing will include not only weight loss but also ""Before & After"" of other important health markers and physiological functions. Stretch Goal:  $70,000 - Experiment 2:  First ever university group study on the FUELSTRIP customized body type weight loss program in conjunction with drinking the FUELSLIM Fit Body Drink twice a day and its effects on weight loss over a 6 to 8 week period.
Rewards:  Vial of FUELSTRIPS, The FUELSTRIP diet program, FUELSLIM Fit Drink,  Personal Weight Loss Consultation with Dr. Bo. 







Lisa from Chicago
""Words can't describe how happy I am with my new body. The FUELSLIM  drink gave me the energy boost I needed to get through the day and the custom diet told me what I have to eat. I had tried so many fad diets and nothing worked. But FUELSLIM was different.  I wasn't hungry. And Dr. Bo's diet wasn't just some generic advice - it was my diet for my body. I used to be shy but now I am so confident in my own body. Thank you!"" 
Josh from Atlanta
""The FUELSLIM Fit Drink really works! I followed the diet for 7 days and I have been drinking the superdrink for two months. It stopped those late night ice cream binges and it was easy to follow my custom green diet.  In 2 months I lost 35 pounds! I highly recommend FUELSLIM to everybody.""
Zack from Miami
""I moved here from Toronto 6 months ago, and it's beach season all year round. I had love handles and no muscles and it was tough to compete for the ladies attention. I started the FUELSTRIP program and very quickly I noticed my body changing. The diet and the drink changed my life. My fat converted into muscle and I got motivated to see that 6 pack. I'll never stop taking the FUELSLIM drink.""

WHAT' S SO SPECIAL ABOUT FUELSLIM FIT DRINK?


Extensive research showed that the issue with other products was the focus on a single “magic” ingredient. So after years of R&D, our physicians designed an advanced weight loss drink that attacks fat in many different ways. So while we all have different reasons for putting on the pounds, the precise blend of 13 all-natural ingredients in the FUELSLIM fat burning superdrink will be sure to provide a solution that works on your body. What are the 13 ingredients that will make you shed the weight?




Garcinia Cambogia is a fatburner, appetite suppressant, and mood enhancer. A pumpkin-shaped fruit that grows in Southeast Asia and India, it prevents new fat cells from forming by inhibiting the cirate lyaze enzyme from converting excess carbs into fat.




Forskolin burns body fat, builds lean muscle, and breaks down fatty tissue. A member of the mint family, it Increases the levels of hormone sensitive lipase and cyclic AMP (cAMP) which combined boosts your metabolism and gives you all natural, lasting energy, and burns fat all day long.




L-Carnitine is an amino acid that promotes fat loss by converting fat into fuel and increasing energy levels and lean muscle.




Mucuna Pruriens is a tropical legume that helps control carb cravings and healthy blood sugar levels. Containing the amino acid L-Dopa, it has also been used for centuries as a mood enhancer, aphrodisiac, sleep enhancer, and to control cravings and build lean muscle.




CLA (Conjugated Linoleic Acid) reduces body fat by metabolizing existing fat deposits and increasing the proportion of lean muscle to fat in our bodies.





Fiber is essential to losing those extra pounds because it makes you feel full on fewer calories and promotes the movement of material through your digestive system. It also inhibits the amounts of fat absorbed.




Acai Berry superfruit is an anti-inflammatory antioxidant that reduces appetite and increases Energy. Our Acai also contains polyphenols that neutralize free radicals produced by regular exercise.




Pomegranate superfruit is rich in fiber, antioxidants, vitamin C and polyphenols that together have significant anti-obesity effects. Our Pomegranate also helps to increase blood flow, reduces cholesterol, removes harmful toxins, and boosts energy levels.




Raspberry Ketones cause the fat within your cells to break up more effectively, helping your body burn fat faster. The key compound is adiponectin, which helps your body think it’s thin by regulating yourmetabolism.




BCAA’s (Branch Chain Amino Acids) help reduce cravings and late-night binges, help you exercise harder and longer, make it easier to build muscle, and enable you to burn fat instead of muscle6.




Electrolytes are critical to allow all the cells in your body to operate effectively. They also help flush toxins and oxygenate your muscles, allowing them to become more toned during exercise.




Vitamin B Complex fights against weight gain by metabolizing fat and increasing energy and serotonin levels.




Biotin helps the nervous system use calories more efficiently thereby reducing the feelings of fatigue that usually come with diet restrictions and exercise. It also improves the body’s energy processing and digestion, and helps grow healthier hair, skin, and nails.

How does the FUELSTRIP work?
Your body has 3 options to fuel its activity. Depending on your body type and the intensity of your activity it will select between fat, sugar and muscle. Each of these fuel sources has a unique metabolite that is released into the sweat. By testing your sweat for these byproducts after a light workout we can determine what fuel source your body naturally burns. This is key to understanding the best way to feed your body.
Why is it important to analyze your sweat?

When you go to a doctor she examines you and checks your blood work to see what the best treatment options are. He doesn’t prescribe the same pill for all his patients regardless of who they are. When trying to lose weight there is a lot more than calorie counting. The types of food you eat, the timing of your meals, and keeping your blood sugars level all play an important part. There isn’t one best solution for everyone. Depending on your unique genetics and body type different solutions will work better for you. Test your sweat to find out what body type you are and which diet will work for you.

Academic Presenter v2.0 is ready now and you can download it from here.

Why Academic Presenter?

Learning presentation skills will have a significant effect on students’ futures. Traditional presentation software although
are not free, they do not teach our students how to organize their presentation
in a story-like framework. Students just learn to arrange their presentations
in slides linearly which makes it dull and hard to follow. They never learn to
be storyteller like our grandparents.Even though, arranging slides after slides can be suitable for some abstract concepts (e.g. physics and mathematics), but not all topics are abstract. Sometimes, topics need to be shaped into a dynamic
Mind-map diagram to be imaginable. Mind-map diagram helps audience to memorize and follow
the flow of thought easily. It also serves audience to understand interrelation of presented topics. Furthermore, constructing framework of presentation as a mind-map diagram, can help presenters to distinguish major subjects from details. For presenting details, one may still find traditional slides practical.What can be infered is slide-based and canvas-based products are special case of a general tool. This is exactly where Academic Presenter comes into the picture.


Free Dynamic Presentation Software
Academic Presenter is a free software that harness video-game
technology to create spectacular dynamic presentation. It combines capabilities of slide-based software products (such as PowerPoint and Keynote) with a dynamic
canvas (like Prezi). Users will have transitions between slides like PowerPoint
and a dynamic, scalable, rotatable canvas like Prezi. Aforementioned ability can help us to build a dynamic mind-map diagram from raster images or vector-based shapes as a skeleton for the details which can be again another mind-map, media or even traditional slides. 
Some progress has already been made. Academic Presenter version 1.5 is available on internet for free. But
refining software to an acceptable level needs more work in  both development and
marketing. This is where we need your help and supports.
By helping this campaign, Academic Presenter version 2.0 will be developed: a
breakthrough on free presentation products. All students in all around the
world will have access to a great storytelling software and by that they will learn how
to shape their presentations.
Imagine each
presentation becomes a great show with different stories. It will be
awesome!Application of Academic Presenter in Literature ReviewWriting Formulas in Academic Presenter

Fast and easy to learn.


What We Need & What You Get

By looking at traditional products,
you will see name of big companies involving in business software industries. Microsoft and Prezi are just examples of these
companies. By looking carefully, size of the market will be revealed. Students are part of this market and as we know,
they are treated almost the same as the businessmen;
they have to buy the products. 
To promote Academic Presenter, we
have to compete with very big companies and work on training part. Concurrently,
we need to work on the product itself. Therefore, payments for advertising and
teaching students to be our ambassadors will be very expensive and time consuming.
Together, we will walk toward this
beautiful goal:
“Each presentation, one story.”

This learning program seeks to not simply provide students to learn what is necessary for their curriculum's but to broaden their horizons and to learn about cultures beyond their borders.This is why we seek to produce a series of textbooks that are relevant internationally and will roll out to the United Kingdom, Mexico, The United States, France & Sweden within the first two years of the project.The program also seeks to bring new learning methods into the classroom by making new digital tools accessible to teachers without the learning program being reliant upon those new tools.Therefore further learning materials will be produced to incorporate these ideas.The ContentThe project will launch with three editions (see below). All of which will provide a full learning experience for students - not only teaching them about the Mayans and Vikings but encouraging them to compare, contrast and form their own ideas as to the reasons why the two societies developed in the way they did.Whilst the Mayans and Vikings will get the most attention the courses in the textbooks will also put them into their relevant contexts. How did the Mayan's compare to the Aztecs? How did the Vikings interact with the Anglo Saxons and the Scots? How did this older societies compare to the modern day?

How Is It Implemented ?

e-WaveCommunity will engage several actors in the slums to create a cost-effective solution to ECE problems: 







HOW?
A broadcasting team, thanks to the help of early childhood education experts, will create interactive radio educational programs. These programs are adapted for specific age groups following an elaborate curriculum and broadcasted 3 hours per day over the slums.
WHERE?
Caregivers will be the interface between the radio educational programs and the young children. In fact, these educational programs are just a tool used by caregivers to become skilled educators. They create the right framework for them to enable efficient interactions with children. This interactions will take place in babycare centers or at home, because locally-made radios will be distributed for the families.
WHY?
One of the main challenges is to make families understand the importance of ECE. Our Community Managers will work hard to increase awareness among slum dwellers and our MagicBus will play a key role to involve children in the process. It will travel along slums to record part of the educational programs directly with children. Those moments will create new interactions, laughter and a strong community sense. Because ECE can be real fun! 
Moreover this bus will spend hours helping caregivers to become the best teacher possible. A real interface between the recording team and the certified centers.

How Is It Sustainable?











  From the very beggining, the MagicBus and Community Managers will succeed  to convince caregivers to be certified.
  Certified caregivers are trained regulary, monitored and get premium access to all our educational services in exchange of 10% of their revenues. The fees will be collected by a phone paiement system. Assuming that families pay 0.3 $/child/day to the caregiver for existing babycare centers, this means that families will pay a maximum of  0.9 $/child/month if the caregiver decides to affect all the fees to families, which is highly unlikely.
  Community
Managers will promote certified centers along slums and help
parents to find the nearest  certified center. They will also indicate to
the parents all the services included in these caregiving premium education
centers.
  If families cannot afford babycare centers anyway, radios will be provided at very low price for other caregivers -usually relatives- thus allowing early childhood education for every child.
  Additional revenue will be obtained from internationally-sold foreign language learning podcasts.


What Do We Need?

This is an all-or-nothing campaign, which means that if we don't raise the money we need, contributors will not be charged. 

Only 100 000 $ are necessary to fully implement the startup stage in Dharavi (Mumbai, India).
1.  The first 30 000 $, that we would like to raise through this campaign,  will allow broadcasting.

Recording material
Broadcaster’s salary
Curriculum-conception by ECE Experts

2.  Achieving 60 000 $ will allow Community Management.

Community Managers Team’s salary
Community Managers Team’s facilities

3.  The final goal for Dharavi, 100 000 $, will allow the MagicBus.

Bus and Maintenance
Team’s salary
Babycare center’s monitoring

A successful campaign will also help us continue our Hult Prize Competition trip.


Risks & Challenges

The main challenge will be to to integrate slums, to get the confidence of parents and to create global support. That is why e-WaveCommunity's priority is to involve slum dwellers at each state of the process, thus creating a diffuse ambassador's network.

Another challenge could arise from the assumption that government-led radio stations will be available, which reduces notably on-aire time's expenses. However, advertising could be an easy solution if the use of private radio stations were required.


How Can You Help Us?
You can directly help us raise the 30 000 $, but you can also support us by promoting this page on Twitter, Facebook or other social networks in order to reach the number of people this cause deserves.

<p> </p>
<p>Our business plan is based on empirical data from government studies showing that of the 8-12 million annual tourist who visit Niagara Falls, that 6-7% would attend a historic museum. To determine the feasibility of this project we took into consideration our capital expenditures, ticket revenue, acquisition cost, and annual operating expenses; allowing us a true market valuation of $2.6 million dollars once we open our doors.</p>
<p>We found out that any serious investors required us to raise at least 10% of our projected company valuation, which is why we started this campaign. All funds will be used to hire a full time administrator, tracking contributions, surveying the property, registering the business, and drafting conceptual plans leading to the purchase and renovation of this historic landmark building.</p>
<p>Beside offering wonderful gifts for your contribution you have the satisfaction of knowing that you saved one of the worlds most important landmark buildings in the world, preserving Nikola Tesla's legacy and childhood dream. He's not here, nor does he have any heirs to thank you-but we are; and every person, regardless of their amount, will be added to our ""Wall of Fame"" when the museum opens.</p>

<p>The Impact that this campaign offers is enormous.</p>
<p>-It's <strong>RARE</strong> that the general public ever gets the opportunity to become involved in preserving a registered National Historic Landmark building.</p>
<p>-It's even more rare that you can tell your family &amp; friends you preserved Nikola Tesla's legacy.</p>

<p>We acknowledge that according to the Small Business Administration close to 66% of small businesses will survive their first two years. Meaning that only about one-third of total businesses will fail during the first two years.</p>
<p>Since Elon Musk released the ""Tesla"" version of cars, interest in the inventor Nikola Tesla has increased exponentially. Yet, as a company we're cautiously optimistic about creating this campaign.</p>
<p>In 1970 the Native Americans created a heritage center at Niagara Falls called ""The Turtle"" which is an extremely large building in the shape of a turtle. They misjudged that tourist would be interested in visiting their folklore about the earth being held up on the back of turtle. While it was a noble venture, it wasn't attended by many tourist; and as a non-profit, they depended  strictly on state funding to stay open. When state funding stopped 10 years later, the building closed and taken over for back taxes, loosing all their exhibits.</p>
<p>Another pitfall we observed was when New York State refused to renew the water rights of Niagara Mohawk so they could build their own Megawatt Robert Moses Power Plant-during which, they TOOK BY EMINENT DOMAIN over 550 acres of Native American land. After it was built the also obfuscated the remaining historic power plants and bulldozed them into the ground. Which is why we wish to keep this property in private ownership.</p>
<p>We have taken, and will continue to take, every possible measure to mitigate risks so the Adams Transformer House / Tesla Museum will stand for future generations by learning from the above examples. These steps included, but are not limited to creating a Limited Liability Company (sheltering us from frivolous lawsuits), installation of security equipment, providing business insurance and bonds, and any other measures deemed necessary.</p>

To determine the feasibility of this project we took into consideration our capital expenditures, ticket revenue, acquisition cost, and annual operating expenses; allowing us a true market valuation of $2.6 million dollars once we open our doors.
We found out that any serious investors required us to raise at least 10% of our projected company valuation, which is why we started this campaign. All funds will be used to hire a full time administrator, tracking contributions, surveying the property, registering the business, and drafting conceptual plans leading to the purchase and renovation of this historic landmark building.
Beside offering wonderful gifts for your contribution you have the satisfaction of knowing that you saved one of the worlds most important landmark buildings in the world, preserving Nikola Tesla's legacy and childhood dream. He's not here, nor does he have any heirs to thank you-but we are; and every person, regardless of their amount, will be added to our ""Wall of Fame"" when the museum opens.
 

The Impact

The Impact that this campaign offers is enormous.
-It's RARE that the general public ever gets the opportunity to become involved in preserving a registered National Historic Landmark building.
-It's even more rare that you can tell your family & friends you preserved Nikola Tesla's legacy.
-This is a project that will be preserved in history for generations.
-It will stand out as a crowning achievement at Niagara Falls where everyone visits.
 

Risks & Challenges

We acknowledge that according to the Small Business Administration close to 66% of small businesses will survive their first two years. Meaning that only about one-third of total businesses will fail during the first two years.
Since Elon Musk released the ""Tesla"" version of cars, interest in the inventor Nikola Tesla has increased exponentially. Yet, as a company we're cautiously optimistic about creating this campaign.
In 1970 the Native Americans created a heritage center at Niagara Falls called ""The Turtle"" which is an extremely large building in the shape of a turtle. They misjudged that tourist would be interested in visiting their folklore about the earth being held up on the back of turtle. While it was a noble venture, it wasn't attended by many tourist; and as a non-profit, they depended  strictly on state funding to stay open. When state funding stopped 10 years later, the building closed and taken over for back taxes, loosing all their exhibits.
Another pitfall we observed was when New York State refused to renew the water rights of Niagara Mohawk so they could build their own Megawatt Robert Moses Power Plant-during which, they TOOK BY EMINENT DOMAIN over 550 acres of Native American land. After it was built the also obfuscated the remaining historic power plants and bulldozed them into the ground. Which is why we wish to keep this property in private ownership.
We have taken, and will continue to take, every possible measure to mitigate risks so the Adams Transformer House / Tesla Museum will stand for future generations by learning from the above examples. These steps included, but are not limited to creating a Limited Liability Company (sheltering us from frivolous lawsuits), installation of security equipment, providing business insurance and bonds, and any other measures deemed necessary.
 

Other Ways You Can Help

Perhaps you just can't contribute at this time, but you can still help keep his legacy alive by:

Sharing our campaign to social media using Indiegogo share tools
Telling your friends and family about our preservation efforts
Book marking this page so you can come back at another time
Inquiring about our business plan which lays out how the money will be spent.

And that's all there is to it.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

A year ago we decided to create a simple online platform that would help people find jobs using a messenger. </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527049911/qvvcowa9a0xvovlibovw.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We’ve been running a pilot program of our Telegram service in Uzbekistan (Central Asia) for six months. Present job search  websites such as superjob.uz, rabota.uz, headhunter.uz, ishkop.uz, uzjobs.uz lack interactive services to their users. Everyone who is in search of a job facing one or more of the following problems: </p><p>1) Your resume needs to be constantly adjusted or updated. </p><p>2) Or if you are an employer, your vacancy needs to be placed on several different job sites. This requires spending a lot of time. </p><p>3) You often get applications from not-qualified candidates.</p><p>4) The functionality of several websites is limited to desktop version of your browser or simply outdated.</p><p><strong>@Workis is a solution to these problems. </strong></p><p><strong>- Its completely free. Place your resume ➡️ <a href=""https://telegram.im/@workis_bot"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://telegram.im/@workis_bot</a></strong></p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>GENERATION Z WANTS MOBILITY</strong></p><p>Timing is a valuable asset not only for the employers, but also for the job seekers.  The next generation is looking for a simple, quick tool that helps them minimize the time spent searching for a job and maximizes the results, i.e., job offers!</p><p> </p><p>Workis helps to build an impressive resume simply with the help of a smartphone.  It is a Telegram-based bot, which allows job seekers to effectively connect with potential employers. Workis is a cloud-based Telegram messenger service, so you cannot download it.  All data is kept secured in the cloud. In Workis, anyone can write a resume or create a job vacancy.  With several taps on your smartphone, you can immediately begin receiving job offers or resumes from potential candidates.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526408764/ya9jlg8kvnm4uhjfsz8u.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>WHY CHOOSE WORKIS?</strong></p><p>People are choosing Workis because it is user-friendly and mobile.  People can now perform job searches in messengers. </p><p>The vast majority of smartphone owners use messengers. They can check messages, chat with friends, and read news.  With the help of a messenger, anyone can have job information with the click of a few buttons.  Your job vacancy won’t get lost in junk mail because statistics show that people read everything they receive via messengers. Searching for potential employees powered by Workis in messengers is the most efficient tool for filling job vacancies!</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526408792/oz0ba5oaeikykatznjhj.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><br/><i><strong>The potential users of the project are 200 million Telegram users and 1.3 billion Facebook messenger users.</strong></i></p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Workis is designed not only for active job seekers, but also for working professionals looking for a career change. </strong></p><p>Those who are employed or continuing their job search in a passive way normally follow a specific company or industry in order to not to miss a promotion or a better job environment. With Workis,  anyone can find a vacancy in practically industry.</p><p>Everyone wants to be efficient, and Workis gives you the edge you need to be efficient.</p><p><strong>It allows you to:</strong></p><p>1) use the messenger for a job search.  61% of human resources managers and recruiters in Uzbekistan named the Workis messengers ”more effective than job search websites, emails or social network announcements.” (The survey was conducted by the Telegram channel @trudmarket with 5125 subscribers.)</p><p>2) assess the qualification of a potential candidate.  Workis can check the skills of any candidate for a job vacancy. This saves employers time and energy and increases the quality of the potential job candidates. Simply add a test to the job vacancy, and Workis will help you ""filter"" out unqualified candidates.</p><p>3) upload a resume conveniently with the help of Workis or a template.</p><p>4) use various qualification tests to check the work proficiency and job skills that potential employers need.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526410002/nwi1h7k7pegny21xtkym.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>EMPOWER THE SEARCH FOR JOB CANDIDATES</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p>There are a lot of smart solutions to help you select qualified candidates based on the information contained in job resumes. However, this sometimes is not enough to make the right decision. When hundreds of applications are received for one vacancy, it is not easy to make the best selection.</p><p>Workis can also help employers in this situation. Employers are able to assess the job seeker’s competence and experience automatically.  The auto-testing function speeds up the pre-selection process because only competent job applicants will be selected.

A year ago we decided to create a simple online platform that would help people find jobs using a messenger.    We’ve been running a pilot program of our Telegram service in Uzbekistan (Central Asia) for six months. Present job search  websites such as superjob.uz, rabota.uz, headhunter.uz, ishkop.uz, uzjobs.uz lack interactive services to their users. Everyone who is in search of a job facing one or more of the following problems: 1) Your resume needs to be constantly adjusted or updated. 2) Or if you are an employer, your vacancy needs to be placed on several different job sites. This requires spending a lot of time. 3) You often get applications from not-qualified candidates.4) The functionality of several websites is limited to desktop version of your browser or simply outdated.@Workis is a solution to these problems. - Its completely free. Place your resume ➡️ https://telegram.im/@workis_bot GENERATION Z WANTS MOBILITYTiming is a valuable asset not only for the employers, but also for the job seekers.  The next generation is looking for a simple, quick tool that helps them minimize the time spent searching for a job and maximizes the results, i.e., job offers! Workis helps to build an impressive resume simply with the help of a smartphone.  It is a Telegram-based bot, which allows job seekers to effectively connect with potential employers. Workis is a cloud-based Telegram messenger service, so you cannot download it.  All data is kept secured in the cloud. In Workis, anyone can write a resume or create a job vacancy.  With several taps on your smartphone, you can immediately begin receiving job offers or resumes from potential candidates.   WHY CHOOSE WORKIS?People are choosing Workis because it is user-friendly and mobile.  People can now perform job searches in messengers. The vast majority of smartphone owners use messengers.

Searching for potential employees powered by Workis in messengers is the most efficient tool for filling job vacancies! The potential users of the project are 200 million Telegram users and 1.3 billion Facebook messenger users. Workis is designed not only for active job seekers, but also for working professionals looking for a career change.

With Workis,  anyone can find a vacancy in practically industry.Everyone wants to be efficient, and Workis gives you the edge you need to be efficient.It allows you to:1) use the messenger for a job search.  61% of human resources managers and recruiters in Uzbekistan named the Workis messengers ”more effective than job search websites, emails or social network announcements.” (The survey was conducted by the Telegram channel @trudmarket with 5125 subscribers.)2) assess the qualification of a potential candidate.  Workis can check the skills of any candidate for a job vacancy. This saves employers time and energy and increases the quality of the potential job candidates.

You're not a native speaker and bold and italic font only go so far in conveying the subtlety and cadence of a new language. What if it were possible to hear all the words and phrases in your phrasebook spoken by a native speaker - without even having to download a special app to your phone? Jangobot connects the messaging app you already use, like Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp, Telegram, and Wechat to your print or ebook Langojango phrasebook. Visit a link on our website provided in your book and Jangobot will be added as contact in the messenger app you choose. You only need to do this once. After adding Jangobot as a contact, the next step is to ask it what you want to hear. Every word and phrase in your phrasebook is assigned an index number. For an example in German: 146. Where is the nearest train station? Wo ist der nächste Bahnhof?Simply message Jangobot in your messenger app with the index number in your phrasebook. Jangobot will deliver the audio of the native speaker for you to play in just a few seconds. You can do this with all 3,000 words and phrases in your phrasebook. Jangobot works on your phone, your tablet, or your computer - basically anywhere you can access your messaging application.Jangobot is included for free with your phrasebook purchase and requires no monthly subscription.With your Langojango phrasebook and Jangobot, you will read and hear 3,000 essential words and phrases you need as a tourist, business traveler, or student.

<p><strong><i>Dr. Claudio Coronel Sanmartin, creador de la Campaña  Ecuador Unido Por la Salud y la Vida.</i></strong></p>
<p>La Organización Mundial De La Salud, realizó un clamoroso llamado a los gobiernos de América Latina y del Mundo, en Febrero de 2015, debido a que el sobrepeso, la obesidad y la desnutrición son un problema de la Salud Pública Mundial, ya que traen consecuencias mortales y prematuras como lo son los problemas cardiovasculares, la diabetes y la hipertensión. Solo practicando la alimentación saludable se puede prevenir miles de muertes prematuras y esa es la misión de ECUVIDA, frenar ese gran problema que existe en Ecuador y en el mundo.</p>
<p>Desde hace 25 años junto con mi familia practicamos y predicamos una alimentación saludable, basado en el consumo de frutas y vegetales; mi familia esta compuesta por mi esposa de 46 años de edad, mis dos hijas de 21 y 23 años y yo Claudio Coronel de 62 años nunca he estado enfermo, no se lo que es un examen de sangre, ni de ninguna otra clase, somos una familia saludable.</p>
<p><strong><u>CAMPAÑA</u></strong></p>
<p>La campaña Ecuador Unido Por La Salud y La Vida, busca motivar que la gente consuma mas frutas y vegetales, porque tener una alimentación saludable, es la mejor manera para prevenir la salud. Ecuador es primer productor del mejor banano del mundo, somos exportadores de esa maravillosa fruta, ademas de mango, piña, melón, frutilla, brocoli, aguacate, entre otros. En Ecuador somos productores de frutas y vegetales en abundancia, consecuentemente son muy baratos. Nuestro objetivo con esta campaña es crear una cultura de alimentación saludable, en conjunto con el presidente del Ecuador, Lcdo. Lenin Moreno Garces, con el Ministerio de Salud, Ministerio de Educación, con los Alcaldes, entre otras instituciones.</p>
<p>La ayuda de ustedes ciudadanos del Ecuador y del Mundo será extraordinaria, porque tendremos la extraordinaria oportunidad de iniciar esta campaña de incalculables beneficios para la salud y la vida de mas de 16 millones de Ecuatorianos y de billones en el mundo. Con esta estrategia de campaña motivaremos al Gobierno del Ecuador y demás gobiernos del Mundo, ya que se ahorraran miles de millones de dolares y con el Sistema de Salud Preventiva evitaremos millones de muertes prematuras.</p>
<p><u><strong>LO QUE NECESITAMOS:</strong></u></p>
<p>Lo que necesitamos para realizar una agresiva campaña utilizando todos los medios de comunicación y crear estrategias para motivar a las personas, son por lo menos $485.000 (Cuatrocientos ochenta y cinco mil Dolares). El dinero recaudado sera encausado para la constitución de la Fundación ECUVIDA, la misma institución será la encargada de administrar los recursos obtenidos de esta campaña de recaudación de fondos, para poner en marcha la Campaña Ecuador Unido Por La Salud y La Vida. Con esto contribuiremos con una de las mas grandes obras sociales, nunca antes realizadas.</p>
<p>En caso de no conseguir la gran meta de los fondos, igual continuaremos con nuestro propósito, aunque nos toque demorar un poco mas esa Gran Campaña Nacional e Internacional. Igual iniciaremos la campaña Ecuador Unido Por La Salud y La Vida.</p>
<p><u><strong>IMPACTO:</strong></u></p>
<p>Esta Campaña causara un impacto extraordinario, único, que será de transcendental importancia para la gente mas pobre del Ecuador y del Mundo, porque es de salud, pero también busca crear ahorro para las familias y para los gobiernos, ya que los gastos en salud son millonarios, porque no existe salud preventiva que motive la alimentación saludable.</p>
<p>Es valioso para quienes colaboren porque estaremos contribuyendo al inicio de una Campaña Nacional e Internacional, única en la historia del Ecuador y del Mundo, ya que gracias a la tecnología, las redes sociales, contribuiremos con la Campaña ECUVIDA, para tener mayor alcance a los demás países del mundo.</p>

Think about it – why going half way around the world when 5 minutes away from your house there must be plenty of new things for you to see… We believe travel is a value on its own.We believe that traveling is the right thing to do.We believe in travel, and its power to change the world.We believe you can help make a difference, one step at a time. WHO? ILH – Israel Hostels, is Israel’s first independent hostel network, gathering over 30 of Israel’s finest hostels.Our members provide quality accommodations at affordable prices from the Golan Heights in the north to the Red Sea down south.Our mission is to support independent travelers in Israel and to provide them with a high-quality, unique and safe travel experience.At the photo, you can have a small glance into our community,showing hostel owners, workshop graduates & lecturers.From left to right & top to bottom:IRIS - Jericho Inn, AHMED - Juha's Guesthouse, SHOVAL - Florentine Hostel, DAN - Jerusalem Hostel (ILH Workshop graduate), SHIMI - Kibbutz Inbar Country Lodging, ZIV - Old Jaffa Hostel, ​OMER - Overstay & Tiberias Hostel (ILH Workshop graduate & lecturer), ARNON – Jerusalem Hostel & Old Jaffa Hostel, AMEER – Fauzi Azar Inn, ORI – ILH manager (ILH Workshop graduate), ALON – Golan Heights Hostel, YARON – Abraham Hostels (ILH Workshop lecturer), LIAD – Golan Heights Hostel (ILH Workshop graduate), MILOU & ALON – Golan Garden (ILH Workshop graduates), KENYA – Milk & Honey (ILH Workshop graduate), AMALIA – Old Jaffa Hostel, EFRAT (& LITTLE TAMAR) – ILH previous manager, LEE – The Green Backpackers Hostels (ILH Workshop lecturer), EMMA – Abraham Hostel TLV, NETA – Juha's Guesthouse (ILH Workshop graduate & lecturer), VALERIE – Tiberias Hostel, ODED – Clil Guesthouse (ILH Workshop graduate), GIL – TripTouch
WHAT?
 Our ideology stands behind our project of Independent Tourism Workshops: professional courses by lectures from the tourism industry aimed at helping independent entrepreneurs to open & operate their own hostel. In accordance with a Social Business's point of view, our hostel owners and tourism experts help opening successful (and at times competing) businesses.It is a new kind of capitalism that serves humanity's most pressing needs: using a money-propelled industry,  in order to build a shared social and economic interest, boosting small independent businesses and cross-sectoral collaborations.  
That's how it works:A backpacker / traveler – stays in a hostel. His money spent per night starts a trickle-down effect throughout the community, which supports an ever-growing economic circle:

The hostel staff: owners, reception staff, cleaning staff.

Outsourced staff: laundry, food & beverages suppliers, maintenance & kitchen.

Basic local services: transportation, post office, money exchange, kiosks & grocery shops. 

Local food & beverages: food stands, coffee shops, restaurants and bars.

Leisure activities & attractions: Clubs & nightlife, sport attractions, museums, workshops, exhibitions and festivals.

Tourist services: Shuttles, tour guides, information centers and local souvenir shops.

The touristic experiences keeps developing by the support of the money trickle-down effect. 
The shared economic interest generates wide spread collaborations, which encourage cultural co-existence. 
These developments mature into a better touristic product, which in turn attracts more travelers. 
The social and economic development – entwined into the touristic product of an entire community – keeps developing together.
  Imagine what we can achieve by amplifying our already successful workshops to a wider scale. Imagine an industry based on independent businesses, supported by independent people – without any governmental involvement.Imagine that industry being one which serves to host foreign independent travelers in the best travel experience possible, in the Middle East in general, and in Israel in specific. Our workshops cover the following aspects:
ILH – Israel Hostels' association agenda and activities.
Opening a Hostel from the group up.
Challenges of operating a small Hostel out of the ""must see"" touristic areas.
Day to day Hostel management.
Hostels industry worldwide.
Sales & Marketing, PR and online bookings.
Building a business plan.
Business registration.
Open panel for questions between entrepreneurs and Hostels owners.
Meeting with operating entrepreneurs in the field of independent tourism.
  HOW? We turn to you for support in our vision. As a noon profit organization, we wish to expand the effect of our workshops in three manners:

People: We want our affect to reach a wider crowd, adjusting it to minority crowds in Israel which can benefit from independent tourism: Kibbutz accommodations, Bedouins, traditional-religious neighborhoods, Druze and Baha'is. 

Location: We wish to bring our experience and guidance to the peripheral areas of Israel where the tourism potential is huge yet unapplied, specifically in Akko and the north shore, Haifa and the Druze villages on Mount Carmel, the Dead Sea, the Bedouin and agricultural villages in the Negev desert and the Arava desert around Eilat. 

Professionalism: Nowadays' workshops depends on lectures participating on voluntarily basis. We wish to hire paid lectures as well in order to give a wider and more in depth coverage to the professional lectures given today. 

Frequency: Nowadays the workshops are either annual or biannual at best – according to funds we gather in order to set up a workshop. We need your help in order to run between 4 to 5 workshops a year.
 WHERE? Anywhere and everywhere in Israel!            HOW MUCH? In order to do so we need to gather 29,300 $ - according to the following estimated costs:5 extended workshops per year: 8,500 $The estimated cost per each extended workshop will be 1,700 $ (today's workshops costs to the NGO is 1,100 $ - without salary for lectures). The cost is divided into the following categories:
Lectures fee
Classroom rent
Food & drinks
Accommodation for 20 entrepreneurs

Building the layout for workshops on a regular basis: 20,800 $ 
A part-time NGO employee as a Director of Workshops.
Building programs for target crowds in Israel.
Building programs for target areas in Israel.
Workshops marketing.
 WHY? In the last 4 years we had 7 successful workshops, out of which 13 hostels came to operate – most of them outside of the major cities in Israel: In small villages in the Golan Heights, Tiberias, Nazareth, Cana village, Jisr Az Zarqa, the Yehuda Desert and Arad.The success of our workshops is felt around Israel in areas where till now foreign tourism was... well - foreign. The successful entrepreneurs who made it keeps on developing the touristic product of their areas for travelers to come and experience, and thus inspire others to take this route as well.  Israel is a challenging environment, especially when it comes to tourism. No matter what you political view might be, the success of sharing interests in order to create a sustainable economy – no matter what the cultural background might be – is proving itself.Perhaps, it is precisely that cultural diversity which contributes the most to the success of this endeavor in specific, and to Israel's appeal as a touristic destination in general.This socio-business structure can be imitated anywhere else on earth: harnessing the economic power of tourism in order to yield social development. Just like travel is a universal value on its own, so can be its manifestation into a social tool.  WHAT DO YOU GET IN RETURN? ALL PERKS given for a donation can be for your own plesure or as a gift for a friend, a family member or a lover visiting Israel. We also invite you to donate perks for Lone Soldiers and ""Birthright"" / ""Taglit"" participants who stay to travel in Israel. Check out the perks menu on the right [-->] for detailsILH offers you to enjoy the fruits of the Land of Milk & Honey! As a non profit organization, we collected all of our local supporters in order to give you a worthy value for your support, whether be it Products & Services for your own pleasure or Benefits & Donations for helping others in our community.  ACCOMMODATIONIn return for backing our campaign ILH - Israel Hostels offers a wide range of accommodations in several of our high quality Hostels throughout the country:  Private Rooms, Double Rooms, Dorm Beds and Full Weekends in a hostel! Special Deals & Unique Accommodations! ​The hosting Guesthouses and Hostels include:

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>About me (Alisa C.)</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have worked as a USPS postal carrier some years.I have also successfully earned my CDL licenses.I had to resign from my job as a CDL tractor trailer driver due to the pandemic. Mother of two children. I also have 10 years of experience of taking care children for working families. I am passionate about helping families with their children so that they can work.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;""><strong>About my company</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">Our goal at Non-profit LisaFaye’s Agency is to offer employ nannies and tutors so that parents do not have to pay a company to look for one.  Our company will run thorough background checks, fingerprints, etc.  We want to offer our services to all families who are essential workers and families who are not.  I feel that no person should have to be put in a situation of choosing between their job or their child.  This is why so many people are at home now due to the pandemic.  We want to offer our services to companies to offer to their workers, but the workers pay for it. Our company will also provide surveillance for each person who signs up for our services.  We want to ensure the safety of the child(ren), the parents, and our workers.  This will protect everyone, but mostly the child(ren). We will also offer monthly plans to parents so no more paying by the hour we will have packages so that we can meet their needs.  We will also offer tutoring in-person or virtual.  The tutor services will be an added-on service for families who need it.  Or they can purchase a bundle deal with tutors in the package deal.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul><li>We need a total of $350,000. All funding raised will go towards all cost to hiring people at least 5-10 people, the funding will also go towards purchasing more surveillance so that each client can have them and pay someone to install them.  This funding will be used for more marketing and a better website.  It would also help us fund a better location for our office and make sure that we have it up to state and federally regulated. Once we get the things, we need I would be glad to show proof of where the money went.</li></ul>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;""> </p>
<ul><li>The perks of helping fund our non-profit is that you are helping us help families with the best childcare for families.  You are going to helping children stay safe while their families are at work.  So many children get abused and if we have a chance to do something about it why not.  I believe anytime you do something good for children you get blessed on top of blessings.  You will also help the economy, by funding our company because we will not only be supplying jobs to nannies and tutors but also providing affordable childcare to families so that they can work.  We will also help companies offer our services to their workers so their workers can work at their best and not have to miss or quit their jobs due to them not having someone they can trust to care for their child.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>If we do not reach our entire goal all funding raised will still be put towards the company.  </li></ul>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul><li>My company will help to add more jobs. My company will provide safe and affordable childcare so parents can work.  We will also be helping companies offer our services to their employees so that these companies can stay in business because with more people working that means more spending in the economy</li></ul>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>What qualifies me for this company is the fact that I was one of those workers who had to make a choice between my job or my children.  The caretakers for my kids, while I was away on the road driving trucks, got sick due to the pandemic and are considered high risk.  This broke my heart because I loved my job, but I love my children more.</li>
<li>Anytime a person is dealing with a child(ren) they are taking a risk, but the reward is greater than the risk.   That is why I will provide surveillance with video/audio.  We will also provide contracts for our workers and parents.  The workers will also have emergency pendants to wear so in case if something does happen they can press it and it would alert the authorities to come and know where to go without them having to make a phone call. I will also have someone monitoring surveillance.  The parents will also be able to monitor, too.</li>

Its <b>main goal</b> is obvious: to help you to start your investing with good understanding what you are doing and without reading a huge pile of books. The <b>secondary goal</b> is less noticeable, but not less important: to help you to gain all the knowledge needed down the road. And, opposed to many other resources about investments you can think of, educational part of Black Belt Investments is practice-centric and allows you to stick to the bare minimum of theory needed in practice.<div>The project is 80% ready and the development heads into the homestretch.<br/><div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Let's imagine a situation: you came to school and you want to learn maths. You pay tuition fees and you are offered different courses: algebra, geometry, integral calculus etc. But all of these is too advanced for you. You ask: ""Guys, do you have something simpler, like arithmetic for newbies?"" But they say no. And you have choice: either to learn arithmetic yourself and then proceed with more advanced stuff or to dump the idea of learning maths. Ridiculous?</p>
<p>But when you want to learn about investing, you face pretty much same problem! Look at investment research tools: they are built by professionals for professionals. And they are either extremely newbie-unfriendly or you will have to blindly trust some artificial gauges created by some experts (and they will never tell you how!).</p>
<p>And Black Belt Investments is going to solve this problem.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>How?</h3>
<p>You will get a simple, newbie-friendly investment research tool which will allow you to start investing right away, without reading a pile of books. And if you would like to learn (which is very natural, since you invest money earned in your sweat, blood and hard work!), Black Belt Investments will help you to learn with ease with emphasis on most important practical aspects.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What?</h3>
<p>Now let's delve into more details. At the figure below you can see the main use case scenario: a user wants to know about some publicly traded company X, and he/she finds out how it is good or bad fundamentally (and, of course, the user can verify if the system's results are correct!). After that he/she can assess if it is cheap enough to buy (or, alternatively, to define the threshold when to buy).</p>

</div></div>","Black Belt Investments is a newbie-friendly investment research tool. Its main goal is obvious: to help you to start your investing with good understanding what you are doing and without reading a huge pile of books. The secondary goal is less noticeable, but not less important: to help you to gain all the knowledge needed down the road. And, opposed to many other resources about investments you can think of, educational part of Black Belt Investments is practice-centric and allows you to stick to the bare minimum of theory needed in practice.The project is 80% ready and the development heads into the homestretch.


Why?

Let's imagine a situation: you came to school and you want to learn maths. You pay tuition fees and you are offered different courses: algebra, geometry, integral calculus etc. But all of these is too advanced for you. You ask: ""Guys, do you have something simpler, like arithmetic for newbies?"" But they say no. And you have choice: either to learn arithmetic yourself and then proceed with more advanced stuff or to dump the idea of learning maths. Ridiculous?
But when you want to learn about investing, you face pretty much same problem! Look at investment research tools: they are built by professionals for professionals. And they are either extremely newbie-unfriendly or you will have to blindly trust some artificial gauges created by some experts (and they will never tell you how!).
And Black Belt Investments is going to solve this problem.


How?
You will get a simple, newbie-friendly investment research tool which will allow you to start investing right away, without reading a pile of books. And if you would like to learn (which is very natural, since you invest money earned in your sweat, blood and hard work!), Black Belt Investments will help you to learn with ease with emphasis on most important practical aspects.

What?
Now let's delve into more details. At the figure below you can see the main use case scenario: a user wants to know about some publicly traded company X, and he/she finds out how it is good or bad fundamentally (and, of course, the user can verify if the system's results are correct!). After that he/she can assess if it is cheap enough to buy (or, alternatively, to define the threshold when to buy).
Main Usage Scenario - Unhappy Case

Within 5 minutes you will be able to examine all of these and other aspects: dividends reliability, business's financial statements, most important ratios, performance, capital structure etc.


Main Usage Scenario - Happier Case

This, combined with a simple and powerful
screener (where you will literally ask the system to show you good enough
companies with a possibility to add some more specific confinements on the
search), will become the main usage scenario. In our happy path shown at the
animation above we have omitted some important steps, like scrutinizing the
state of things in the appropriate sector and industry, prospectus, risks
involved etc. But, of course, you will be able to use other modules of the
system, like settings, education, user profile etc.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why a piano?</h3>
<p>Because it is considered one of the most elitist instruments. In today's world, especially in third world countries, finding a real piano can prove to be an extremely strenuous task. Due to their high prices, and bulky sizes, pianos can mostly only be found in luxurious places like hotels or theaters. And, even when one comes across one, its enormous and intimidating size along with its complex look will scare most people away. It is almost as if all pianos had this imaginary ""Do Not Touch"" sign on top of them at all times. We want to challenge this.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Viaje in Sololá</h3>
<p>Earlier this year we had the opportunity to share our dream for the first time. We took a piano which we received as a donation, had a a professional artist give it a friendlier makeover, and set out on our first adventure.</p>
<p>We chose Sololá as our first destination because it is one of Guatemala's most culturally diverse regions. We were intrigued to see the reaction of the people, most of which we were sure had never gotten the chance to see or play a piano during their lives. The doubt existed in in all of our team members' hearts. Most people born and raised in Guatemala have this preconceived belief that it is impossible to leave something valuable on the street, and not having it vandalized or stolen. It is this exact form of prejudice which has created the gap between the population of Guatemala.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>     <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494890709/brqyx6kg8zwidpde6jrr.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>But we were extremely surprised when we saw the first individuals approaching the piano. Out of nowhere, and completely spontaneously, the whole area surrounding the piano got filled with people from all over town, who came to listen and play with the piano. Everyone, from small children, to town leaders, came near the site to experiment with the instrument. Our goal was met, and the message was heard loud and clear: If the piano is there, we are allowed to play it.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>This is exactly what Viaje is looking to do. <strong>To provide the communities with safe social spaces where the prejudice and fear get thrown away, and people who have never been given a chance can come together to share and enjoy with others.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Goals Of Viaje </h3>
<p>     <strong> </strong><strong>We have divided the project into <u>2</u> different phases</strong></p>
<p><strong>Phase 1 </strong>will bring the piano to the main town of each of the <strong>22 departments</strong> (or regions)<strong> </strong>of Guatemala.  The piano will be placed on a public space during three days and three nights for anyone to come close and experience it. To be able to do this, we are looking for the support of individuals and companies, both locally and internationally. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Phase 2 </strong>will be even more ambitious and impactful. We want to be able to provide a select group of people from each of the different departments in Guatemala with our vision and resources, so that they can be the ones that carry our movement to each of the <strong>340 municipalities in the country. </strong>This is a movement made by souls for other souls. We want to spread the message of faith, love, happiness and hope to every single person regardless of their  race, social  or economic status.</p>

Earlier this year we had the opportunity to share our dream for the first time. We took a piano which we received as a donation, had a a professional artist give it a friendlier makeover, and set out on our first adventure.
We chose Sololá as our first destination because it is one of Guatemala's most culturally diverse regions. We were intrigued to see the reaction of the people, most of which we were sure had never gotten the chance to see or play a piano during their lives. The doubt existed in in all of our team members' hearts. Most people born and raised in Guatemala have this preconceived belief that it is impossible to leave something valuable on the street, and not having it vandalized or stolen. It is this exact form of prejudice which has created the gap between the population of Guatemala.
 
     
 
But we were extremely surprised when we saw the first individuals approaching the piano. Out of nowhere, and completely spontaneously, the whole area surrounding the piano got filled with people from all over town, who came to listen and play with the piano. Everyone, from small children, to town leaders, came near the site to experiment with the instrument. Our goal was met, and the message was heard loud and clear: If the piano is there, we are allowed to play it.
 
     
 
This is exactly what Viaje is looking to do. To provide the communities with safe social spaces where the prejudice and fear get thrown away, and people who have never been given a chance can come together to share and enjoy with others.
 
 
 
Goals Of Viaje 
      We have divided the project into 2 different phases
Phase 1 will bring the piano to the main town of each of the 22 departments (or regions) of Guatemala.  The piano will be placed on a public space during three days and three nights for anyone to come close and experience it. To be able to do this, we are looking for the support of individuals and companies, both locally and internationally. 
 
Phase 2 will be even more ambitious and impactful. We want to be able to provide a select group of people from each of the different departments in Guatemala with our vision and resources, so that they can be the ones that carry our movement to each of the 340 municipalities in the country. This is a movement made by souls for other souls. We want to spread the message of faith, love, happiness and hope to every single person regardless of their  race, social  or economic status.
 
 
 

Denise Menes

Denise is a renowned Guatemalan pianist and teacher. She studied at an early age in New York at the Juilliard School of Music, and later on moved back to Guatemala were she became one of the most respected musicians in the country. It is Denise's dream and vision to turn Viaje into her legacy.
     ""I had the chance to study in one of the most prestigious musical universities in the world, Julliard. Being there, I would always feel frustrated whenever I saw my guitarist, violinist, saxophonist, or else classmates carrying their instruments everywhere they would go, while I was bound to play in theaters or concert halls. I always dreamed of a traveling piano.
About a year ago, I decided to turn my dream into a reality.""
 
 

Edy Béhar
       “After twenty one years working in marketing, doing campaigns and commercials for brands like Coca-Cola, KFC, Sprite, YPFB, among many others, I realized that I was tired of creating models to provide a false sense of happiness. I decided to start this trip to generate and document real emotions.
Real emotions that will generate real changes.”
 
Viaje has already started and is on its way to its second location. Every new step the project takes will be fully documented and backed by media.  We invite you to follow us on our Facebook page for any immediate updates on the status of our project.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I’m raising money to go on an educational trip with Midtown International School to Japan for a fresh new cultural experience. This will be my first international trip without a parent. While I’m doing all I can to raise money for this trip, I just can’t do it without you.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To start with, I’ve wanted to go to Japan since I was 10 years old and hope to live there one day. In preparation, over the last 2 years I even started teaching myself Japanese using foreign language apps on my cell phone. My interest started out for superficial reasons like my admiration for anime and vocaloid. However, as I learned more about Japanese history and culture, my fascination for the island grew, and I need 50,000 USD to achieve my goals.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>did you know Japan was until recently (relatively speaking) completely isolated from the world by a government policy called Sakoku (country in chains)? Sakoku didn’t let anyone leave or enter Japan under penalty of death.  When the country opened to the world an interesting culture was revealed.<br/>There are a few things that are unique to Japan that I hope to experience should I receive the required donations:50,000 USD</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Delicious rice cakes called Mochi, that are mostly eaten on the Japanese New Year but are available year-round.<br/>Shintoism are three different sets of characters used in writing.                       <br/>Ikebana (the art of arranging flowers inspired by Shintoism)               <br/>Waka (a form of poetry)                                                                         <br/>Nanga (painting with less color)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Hopefully, while I’m there I can learn some art tips and get a better grasp on drawing human and animal anatomy.<br/>Language immersion, including slang, so I can have regular conversations with my Japanese peers.<br/>To show my appreciation, I will send each person who donates a piece of my original artwork. I assume you know that art is my passion and I want to share a little bit of me with all of you.</p>
<p>Thank you again for your support.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>In the years before becoming an owner of Hope Academy I have had a long career in the field of early childhood education.  My roots in the field of education and working with young children go back more than two decades.  I have been a teacher, early intervention teacher, behavior therapist, school director, small business owner and regional for major childcare companies.  I have had the opportunity to work in schools of different sizes and with many different services and curriculum.  I am excited to be building Hope Academy to meet the needs of children and parents on the South Shore of Long Island.  Hope Academy will be a small Montessori-inspired preschool and daycare.  We will offer access to technology and quality education in a small setting at affordable rates. Hope Academy will offer a safe and clean environment with professional cleaning services onsite at all times.  I am excited to offer ""HOPE"" for children's future through quality education in a safe and clean environment.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To reach our goal and open Hope Academy before the end of 2021 we are asking for funding and community support. The three main areas we are raising funds for are: </p>
<ul>
<li>Playground build out </li>
<li>Interior set up and build out </li>
<li>Curriculum materials</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to achieve our vision of an exciting and educational outside environment we are asking for funding support.  Our fully built and equipped outside learning environment is going to require about $30,000 to achieve.  We are aiming to have three separate spaces outside.  The infant and toddler play area, a preschool and pre-K play area and our outside learning and picnic area.  With these spaces we can provide more outside time in the clean fresh air.  Those who contribute $50  dollars or more to the outdoor build out will have their name or business name displayed on our fence or playground space. We want this playground to reflect community support.  </p>
<p>Our interior space is being built out as an open concept preschool/pre k space with three self-contained toddler and infant classrooms.  Inspiration for Hope's interior design is being taken from the beautiful mural on the outside of our building. This mural depicts an idyllic Long Island beach town and was painted by local high school students back in 1996.  Hope Academy will have a light nature inspired interior with hard-wood floors and light sandy beach colors.  Those who contribute funds to the interior renovations will receive their name or business name on a new mural/display in the school.  (We plan to work with local students to have them paint a new mural inside for us.)  </p>
<p><strong>Help a </strong><b>Child Go To School: If you would like your contribution to impact a local family your donation of $100 dollars or more can be designated for the registration fee for a future Hope Student. You would be giving the gift of education to a child who may not otherwise have access to a comprehensive preschool/pre-K education. Hope Academy will have about 50 students from ages 6 weeks to 6 years old. </b></p>
<p><b>Parents &amp; grandparents who contribute can have their child's registration fee waived for the first year of school .  </b></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Quality education has a life-long impact in a community.  By working with Hope Academy to help us achieve our goal of a bright new school in West Babylon NY you will truly be part of bringing ""Hope"" for the future of this community.</p>
<p>With what the world has experienced over the last year with the Covid19 pandemic families are concerned about traveling far from home for their children's preschool and daycare needs.  Offering a small, clean and local place for families to bring their children is needed in this community .  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Opening a school and daycare is always a challenging process.  However, as veterans in the field of Early Childhood Education Hope Academy leadership has done this before.  Owner Sonia Montigny is experienced in state OCFS regulations and school and daycare management and is ready to take the challenge on.  Many exciting schools and daycares have faced challenges with Covid19.  Hope Academy will be built to address the concerns of parents with regard to Covid19 and will also have a state of art curriculum that will allow parent and student access to the school even when health needs and concerns require students to be out of school.  </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people are unable to contribute financially and we understand that.  Hope Academy asks that if you are unable to donate with a financial contribution that you help us spread the word.  Hope Academy coming 2021/22!  Share our Indiegogo link, check our page often for our fundraising events and enrichment activities.  We will be having community fairs, family picnic days and drop-in learning classes as we work towards our goal.  Spread the word! Cheer us on! </p>

<h3>Our immune system is essential for life!</h3>
<ul>
<li>I am Juan Aldave, a Clinical Immunologist, that is, a physician who helps people affected by disorders of the immune system such as allergies, immunodeficiencies and autoimmunity. Immunology is a fundamental science to understand and alleviate diseases in our modern world. Scientific advances in Immunology cure people worldwide every day.</li>
<li>Our immune system is fantastic! It permanently protects us against microbes and cancer. Without immune system we would not be able to survive!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Learning Immunology is usually hard</h3>
<ul>
<li>As an Immunology professor, two years ago I realized that classic Immunology educational resources are hard to understand for non-expert people. Even worse, if teaching lacks clinical application, most students quickly forget what they learn. The final result is a physician with insufficient knowledge about Immunology.</li>
<li>So, we started the project ""Funny Immunology"", with the aim of producing high-quality, easy-to-understand, funny educational material to teach everyone about the importance of our immune system in health and disease.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Making Immunology easier!</h3>
<ul>
<li>The first step of our ""Funny Immunology"" project was to publish educational books about the immune system written in a simple language style and full of pictures. So far, with the support of Jeffrey Modell Foundation, we have published eleven books of the collection ""Funny Immunology to Save Lives"". You can download them without cost at the following webpages:<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Due to the success of our books, our next idea was to fabricate toys representing immune cells: the amusing Immunocytes! These wonderful toys motivate Immunology learning, not only for physicians and medical students, but also for children who love playing with them. Below you can see Moli, the B lymphocyte, our antibody-producing cell (you can view more characters in the 'Gallery' section).</li>

<ul>
<li>Now we have a new idea in mind! We want to publish an innovative book: <strong>""The magic Interleukins: essential proteins for life""</strong>.</li>
<li>Interleukins are essential proteins for communication between immune cells. We have more than 38 different interleukins, all with several functions. For example, interleukin 17 is necessary to protect our body against infections by the fungus Candida albicans. Knowledge about interleukins has allowed scientists to develop targeted therapies for patients with immune diseases such as immunodeficiencies, allergies, autoimmunity and cancer.</li>
<li>Every physician and medical student should learn about interleukins. However, due to the large number of distinct interleukins and their complex functions, it is one of the hardest topic in Immunology. <strong>Help us publish a funny, enjoyable book about them!</strong>

I saw your post on using MyExam to practice for Jamb UTME which I believe is the only way out for me. I have heard stories of many people who read very well but later failed. Even brother Razaq in our area committed suicide after checking his Jamb score to be 148 on the third attempt.” This story is what can be identified by most students taking this annual test.</p><p>Every year, 1.85 million Nigerian students take the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) and every year mass failure and frustration with the exam dominate headlines. A key reason students are unsuccessful is a lack of access to realistic test practice and preparation. The UTMEs is administered in public test centers on computer, but most test preparation materials provided by schools are in book and paper form. While large tutorial centers for the exam exist, they are largely unaffordable or inconvenient for students to utilize their services.</p><p>I am Opeyemi Adekunle – a web developer and founder of MyExam.com.ng. MyExam.com.ng is a platform built to serve as a place where students can prepare for their upcoming exam through a realistic test taking approach to previous questions on that exam and a 100% resemblance to the original test itself. Our findings have shown that the students practice with a realistic test environment, the less their fear on the real exam day. In 2016, when we did a prototype at a public university in Nigeria (Obafemi Awolowo University), a student (Efe Blessing) came to me and said “When taking the practice exam at OAU, I felt as if I was already doing Jamb. At the original exam, my confidence was +1 and I got 273. Thank you TryJambCBT!”</p><p>Note: MyExam is formally called TryJambCBT.

I saw your post on using MyExam to practice for Jamb UTME which I believe is the only way out for me. I have heard stories of many people who read very well but later failed. Even brother Razaq in our area committed suicide after checking his Jamb score to be 148 on the third attempt.” This story is what can be identified by most students taking this annual test.Every year, 1.85 million Nigerian students take the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) and every year mass failure and frustration with the exam dominate headlines. A key reason students are unsuccessful is a lack of access to realistic test practice and preparation. The UTMEs is administered in public test centers on computer, but most test preparation materials provided by schools are in book and paper form. While large tutorial centers for the exam exist, they are largely unaffordable or inconvenient for students to utilize their services.I am Opeyemi Adekunle – a web developer and founder of MyExam.com.ng. MyExam.com.ng is a platform built to serve as a place where students can prepare for their upcoming exam through a realistic test taking approach to previous questions on that exam and a 100% resemblance to the original test itself. Our findings have shown that the students practice with a realistic test environment, the less their fear on the real exam day. In 2016, when we did a prototype at a public university in Nigeria (Obafemi Awolowo University), a student (Efe Blessing) came to me and said “When taking the practice exam at OAU, I felt as if I was already doing Jamb. At the original exam, my confidence was +1 and I got 273. Thank you TryJambCBT!”Note: MyExam is formally called TryJambCBT. We changed the name to be able to add more major exams students need to pass to the portalConfidence is one major key MyExam instills in students preparing for any exam.

Both of these books are now exclusively available at the Amazon marketplace on Kindle! We introduce positive daily affirmations with Sacred Geometry through the manifestation of the Flower of Life. It is created page after page by adding a new circle with each new letter of the alphabet. Showcasing the Seed of Life on the 7th letter G and the full Flower of Life design by the letter Z. These affirmations are powerful life-affirming statements that inspire the readers' human experience.</p>

develops sensorimotor skills 
boosts children natural ability for out of the box thinking and problem solving skills 

helps them acquire learning patterns that will support them do better at whatever they are on to in their life. 

 WHY DID WE MAKE A MOBILE APP?We decided to develop a mobile app to teach the children that the mobile devices should be used as a tool for additional information and inspiration to build something offline, rather than something to spend your time when you are most bored.It also allows us to ""augment"" the content of the offline cards with video instructions, images or videos of what others have built and possibility for sharing own creations.On top of that and if we meet our stretch goals, the mobile app allows us to make:

We worked closely with teachers, psychologists, art pedagogues and parents. Hired one of the best children illustrators in the country and worked with a world class printing house.

Thanks, Eli!  Evga (Evgenia Nikolova) is Art Director in Next DC - the best Digital Creative Agency in Bulgaria and one of the founders of ""Ribka publishing"" - a small publishing house focused on children books with unique illustrations. Evga created the beautiful brand and the design for the cards but most importantly was our corrective for everything visual we tried to produce, including the overall content and look & feel of this page :) Thanks, Evga!   Jeni (Jenia Milusheva) is children-adolescent and school psychologist with more than 10 years of experience.  She has specializations in the fields of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Family Therapy, Play Therapy and Parent-Child Interaction Therapy. She knows everything Montessori and Waldorf and was able to translate it even to us - the digital nerds from the software industry.Jenia helped us to polish the content for the cards and figure out what actually the whole product should be. It is her idea to provide to parents and educators quick tips re: how to create stories and create the needed atmosphere so the children feel most relaxed and motivated for making. Thanks, Jeni!  Yuli (Yulian Naydenov) is fine arts pedagogue with more than 20 years of experience teaching children and adolescents. Together with Jenia, he helped us figure out the content of the first 2 cards (actually he insisted in making 3 in the beginning:)). Yuli provided us with precious know-how regarding the best way to teach arts to children so that it's applicable from toddlers to high-schoolers. We will reveal that in some of the remaining cards we will make for the set. Thanks, Yuli! HOW CAN YOU HELP?  WHEN TO EXPECT THE DELIVERY?  WANT TO HELP EVEN MORE?Spread the word on",22.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Wind of Happiness Campaign Launches in Nigeria</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hello there, I'm<a href=""https://twitter.com/TWTWfilm"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong> Wind</strong></a>, a blue dinosaur character created by<strong><i> <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Minglang-Production-1773669816074255/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Minglang Production</a></i></strong> (based in China). Last year I went to Nigeria and met kids there. We shared stories, watched movie footage from my company together. I began to know more about them. I really like them and it's my great honor if I could make these little angels even happier. This year, with my film approaching its post-production stage, I'll go to Nigeria to have fun with the kids and bring happiness to them.</p></li>
<li><p> This year I'm planning to meet some kids in Nigeria again in September 2018. My friend Rosanna has contacted schools and they allowed us to do a special activity with their children in a cinema. <strong>We'll give out stationery they need for a new semester and fund the schools. They'll all get Travel With the Wind products.  </strong>Probably, I'll bring them an animation film called <a href=""https://m.facebook.com/Minglang-Production-1773669816074255/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Travel With the Wind</i></a> . BTW, this film is produced by Minglang Production and It's  permitted for me to screen it once I'm with the kids. </p></li>
<li><p>I launch this campaign because I need some help to purchase a lot of stationery, such as backpacks, books, pens, crayons and some stuff a school needs to conduct teaching. Besides, I guess lots of people from all over the world are thinking about or ever had the idea to offer help to people in need but you might encounter difficulty in implementing your plan. Then this is a great opportunity for you to fulfill your dream! Come join us! <strong>Together we can make a difference! More fund from you means more kids and schools are going to be helped!!</strong></p></li>

<p>Lily is a voice-controlled speaker that can simply and easily teach you Chinese - think Alexa for Chinese learning!

</div></div>","We‘re a team of Chinese language learners and machine learning engineers who specialize in voice processing and we’ve invented an exciting device that can teach you Chinese faster than anything on the market. 

Lily is a voice-controlled speaker that can simply and easily teach you Chinese - think Alexa for Chinese learning! The fastest way to learn a language is not simply through reading books or the use of a basic app but to immerse yourself in the language and speak as much possible.

Learn Chinese by speaking directly with Lily. No voice-actor dialogs you must memorize but instead real interactive conversations to help you understand the language. Lily uses speech recognition to understand what you say and uses voice synthesis to reply with a human voice. 

Translation has never been easier. Just ask Lily and get a response in real-time. Every translation is then logged into our mobile app so that you can find them later and review. 
Learning vocabulary is tedious due to having to memorize long vocabulary lists. We’re changing all of this. Our voice games help you actively learn vocabulary, with oral questions and animations making the whole learning process fun and sticky. 
Our Chinese voice assistant immerses you into a full Chinese language environment, from the comfort of your own home. Learning through immersion is the best way to become fluent in Chinese and better understand the culture.
 

 
See your conversations in Pinyin and learn Chinese characters with our mobile app. Get more details about each phrase including the translation and word breakdown.   We want you to have a great Chinese accent and we have designed the best way to help you achieve that goal. For a given phrase, you can check the accuracy of your pronunciation, see which words have been mispronounced and compare with perfect Chinese pronunciation. In collaboration with professional Chinese tutors, we’ve developed easy to understand training programs so that you can reach a target Chinese level in 3, 6 or 12 months. We have a well- designed curriculum with regular exercises and a progress tracking system. Lily can help improve your Chinese, no matter what stage you are at from beginner to advanced. Based on your product usage, we can approximate your Chinese language level and customize Lily’s teaching level so that it best fits your needs.We’ll be adding more languages after Q2 2019, starting with French and Spanish. People who buy Lily now will benefit from those new languages just updating their software, for free. Lily was designed with music in mind. Great sound begins with great driver design; a custom designed long-throw woofer for rich vocals, deep bass, dynamic range and a full-size edge-driven tweeter to deliver the high-fidelity audio resolution that you would find in a high-end home speaker. The drivers are managed by a perfectly tuned 30W high-power class D amplifier.The audio team crafted the sound output with a true 360 degree by 100-degree constant directivity horn. The constant directivity means that anywhere within this listening window, you hear the same sound. The result? Anywhere you place the speaker and anywhere you are in the listening window, you’re immersed in deep bass, rich vocals, and crisp highs. No corners were cut and no compromises were made. Lily is wrapped in a seamless knit fabric with both a beautiful texture and a strong permeability to sound. We engineered a low stitch density fabric so that its intermeshing loops can be elastic and stretch during assembly into large ""holes"" to better let the sound pass through.Maybe is the only language learning company in the world that has vertically integrated its own hardware, its own voice AI and its own language learning content (each being a barrier to market entry by itself) into a language learning tool smarter than any other. In 2014, before Amazon Echo existed, our team started working on voice-controlled speakers. Since then, we've engineered 3 voice-controlled speakers with some of the biggest Internet companies in the world and developed the voice AI to power them. 

For teaching Chinese, we had to develop specific voice AI technology that can't be found in usual voice-controlled devices, whether it's being able to understand people speaking Chinese with a strong accent, or synthesizing a voice that can speak both English and Chinese fluently.

Whether you are coding for the first time or you’ve learned some Scratch in school, Kamibot Pi is a fun and easy way to learn functional coding. Kamibot started with the idea of creating moving interactive papercrafts, and evolved into  teaching young students to code with an interactive robot. Our goal was to create a robot that was perfect for the school desk with a few more features that will allow the teachers to do more for their lesson plans. Kamibot Pi also complies with Japanese National standards for STEAM robots used in coding education. Ever worry about how to teach your child or students coding? You're not alone. We have many teachers in Korea who were just as lost as you might be. We've created a curriculum to guide your students step-by-step to becoming self sufficient coders. Coding with Action Cards:Kamibot Pi is codable with command cards straight out of the box. Kids can feed the cards to Kamibot Pi and see the commands come to life. Not needing a smart device to code their robots is a relief for many teachers and parents who do not have access to a tablet device. Coding with the RoCoCon (Remote Control): Kamibot Pi is also codable with the RoCoCon (Short for Robot Coding Controller)!  The remote control will only be available to backers at specific reward tiers.  Graphical coding with our Kamicard app allows users to pick commands based on the images on each card.Block-based coding with our Kamiblock 3.0 introduces more structure and more advanced commands for coding Kamibot Pi. Seasoned coders can take Kamibot Pi to the next level with Python coding. Children can explore their artistic creativity through coding. A few adjustments to your code here and there show up as new shapes and drawings.If you can code it, Kamibot will draw it.   Team up with your friends and play an arcade classic.   Collaborate with your friends on cool projects like recreating the solar system. Code the path of Earth’s orbit around the sun and the Moon’s orbit around the Earth.Work together with your friends to clean up our oceans of trash.

Challenge your friends to see who can code their robot to catch the most fish.

 


 Our new Kamibot skins don’t only give Kamibot a cool new look. These skins give children a hands-on approach to purposeful coding. 
 


 

Our in-depth curriculum and multitude of activities will help boost your child’s critical thinking and problem solving skills.







Our coding apps are easy to use and are designed so that you can learn coding at your own pace. If you want just want to remotely control Kamibot Pi we have an app for that too.
 



 



We’ve redone our block-based coding app. The new and improved Kamiblock 3.0 will support the “multiple robot coding” that a lot of our teachers were requesting. This is exciting news for kids that want to code multiple robots to perform cooperative tasks.
Kamibot Pi is a perfect coding robot for children from ages 3 and up. Kamibot Pi’s coding curriculum makes it great for use in schools, academies, Montessori schools, and at home.
 Follow along with the video and learn how to code your Kamibot Pi to move like a caterpillar using Kamiblock 3.0. 
We are still working on Kamiblock3.0  and will be releasing it for download before we ship to our backers.

Show your support by backing us right away and learn about topics in Computer Vision such as Object Tracking, Augmented Reality, Face Detection, Optical Flow, Human Pose Estimation and many more.  Unlike many Computer Vision courses available online, this hands-on course approaches Computer Vision more practically, experientially and intuitively. All you need is a working knowledge of the Python programming language. And, if you are not confident about your Python skills, we will direct you to some of the best-curated resources on Python, so that you come up to speed with Python in the shortest possible time.In short, beginners, coding enthusiasts, start-up owners, Tony Stark fans - everyone is welcome to this introductory course.     OpenCV is the largest and the most popular Computer Vision library in the world. It is utilized by thousands of companies, products and devices, and is tested for scalability and performance every single day. We, at OpenCV.org, are on a mission to educate a global workforce. We have been offering very comprehensive online courses in Computer Vision to professionals, job-seekers and enthusiasts from over 100 countries. After the success of our first Kickstarter campaign in 2019, AI Courses By OpenCV.org, we want to make the practical knowledge of Computer Vision available to anyone who is interested in entering the world of Computer Vision. All we need is your support! 
Designed By Industry Experts: OpenCV For Beginners has been designed by our team of engineers and researchers, currently working in the field of Computer Vision and Deep Learning.
Powered By Python: The programming language of choice for this course is Python, one of the most comprehensive and widely used languages in AI.
Foundational & Experiential Learning: This course will help you develop essential understanding and practice of the subject matter before committing to more intermediate and advanced learning paths. This has been done using real-life examples which can be executed using your own data as well. As you proceed through the course, regular quizzes will also keep testing your level of understanding while providing important feedback to you.
Practical & Intuitive:  The field of Computer Vision contains many theoretical underpinnings which can become a stumbling block for beginners, especially, when courses contain heavy mathematics. With this in mind, we have created this course with an emphasis on understanding through concrete, practical examples and explanations based on intuition rather than detailed mathematics which are covered in our advanced courses.
 Once the course begins, we will provide you with extensive forum support in order to get you and your system ready for the course. We will always be there with you to troubleshoot any technical issues associated with software installation or executing any of the code provided in the course. Your questions will be answered by a team of instructors. In addition, we encourage you to brainstorm with your peers in the discussion forum and maybe even find a future collaborator to work with. Each module in this well-structured course contains a tutorial introduction to a particular topic. This is followed by an application example to further reinforce the concepts. In these tutorials, we aim to provide the intuition necessary for true understanding as well as an explanation of the code. The applications developed in this course will be something you can actually use and build upon. The unique curriculum offered in this course is aimed at providing you with a solid foundation in the field of Computer Vision. We will take great pride in each and everyone who completes it successfully. Upon completion of the course, we will award you with a digital certificate from OpenCV.org. You can showcase it across your social profiles and give a kickstart to your career and continued studies in the field of Computer Vision. It’s a lucky day! It’s a lucky course!With just a few clicks, you can show your support to us. In return, we will show our appreciation and let you in on our special Indiegogo deals. These deals are exclusively for our Indiegogo backers and won’t be available once the campaign ends.Extraordinary discount on OpenCV For Beginners courseHeavy discounts on all ‘Add-Ons’All our popular courses offered as ‘Add-Ons’ at huge discounts No deadline for course completion; complete the course and earn your certificate at your own pace This course also gives you a fantastic chance to win lifetime access to another course of your choice.

<h3>Mumtaz's story</h3>
<p>My Name is Mumtaz Ahmed Ahmed. I belong to Khuzdar, a city in Balochistan, which is one the most conflict effected and underdeveloped regions of Pakistan. Despite the odds, with the support of my parents I graduated from the University of Karachi where I studied International Relations in 2017. As a student I was active in supporting students rights, organizing and participating in sit ins and protests to ensure better provision of educational facilities for my fellow students. After graduation I have worked with different  NGOs on peace building, gender equality, health and education. I worked as a Union council, Communication Officer at the World Health Organization from 2018 to 2020 and I am presently teaching at the  Lasbela University of Agriculture Water and Marine Science. </p>
<p>Recently, I secured admission in the MSc programme  ""Climate Change and International Development"" at the University of East Anglia UK with 80% scholarship. I am raising funds for  the rest of my tuition fees and living expenses. While I am continuing to save what I earn, given the exchange rate it will not be enough to fund the remaining 20% for which I am now raising funds. Please do consider contributing to support my further studies. My session will begin in September. Your small contribution make a huge difference for me. Thanking you for your support.</p>
