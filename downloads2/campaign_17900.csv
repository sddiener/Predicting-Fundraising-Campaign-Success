are bringing this  this 1960s classic to the 21st century with an immersive and interactive production that will include a surround sound system (the only way you are meant to listen to the music of The Who), mind-blowing visual projections, and eclectic costumes that will forever alter your theatre-going experience!But to accomplish all of the above, we need your support to raise $10,000 via Indiegogo by Opening Night on Wednesday, May 13, 2015!

Story of The Who's TommyDeprived of sight, hearing and speech by the shock of what he had 
witnessed as a child, young Tommy Walker seems lost to life – until he 
reveals an uncanny talent for the game of pinball. When his lost senses 
are suddenly restored, Tommy is hailed as a living miracle. The classic 
rock musical arrives for the first time at East West Players in an 
electrifying new production.

There are a lack of roles for women and ethnic minorities in film, television and theatre.  Statistics come out every year and they are very disheartening.  However there is a hunger for a more diverse representation of the society we live in — all ages, races, genders, and sizes.  The Hollywood ideal of size zero, male, Caucasian and twenty is very limiting and damaging.  People want to see themselves represented — it’s how we relate to the story.  
Rather than becoming discouraged we decided to take action! We created Jet Girls Productions to produce theatre and film projects with a mandate to bring more diversity in all its forms to stage and screen.  Our productions will focus on creating original works and re-imagining previous works.  Prior to Jet Girls we have written, produced and acted in numerous theater, television and film projects. 
David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross is our first production as a team.  This is a chance to feature an extraordinary ensemble of female performers with a fresh take on one of the great modern classics.  We chose this play because the themes of greed, competition and ambition are not male or female characteristics.

</div><p></p><h3></h3><h3>History in the Making</h3><p></p><p>My name is S. Christopher Boggs. I have been an actor/director/producer and writer within the Little Rock theatre community for a number of years. In late January of 2014, I came up with a crazy idea for a play and pitched it to my wife. She loved it and encouraged me to start fleshing the story out. Roughly a month later, ""The Winning Numbers"" (TWN) was finished. I reluctantly put the script down for a while, but then quickly picked it up again and began fine tuning it.  It has been my good fortune to be a member of Community Theatre of Little Rock (CTLR) and even more fortunate that TWN was considered for their 2014-15 season. </p><p>The weekend of April 24th-26th 2015, TWN will have its World Premiere performances at The Studio Theatre, where Community Theatre of Little Rock currently performs. A special VIP show will be held on April 23rd. I can not tell you how excited, nervous, elated and stressed out I have been over the past year and how excited, nervous, elated and stressed I am about the next couple of months (AHHHHH!!!). </p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The cast and crew of ""The Winning Numbers"", along with Community Theatre of Little Rock, are seeking support from donors like you. Donation will go to help offset the cost of building our set, purchasing costume pieces and props, handling publicity, etc., so that all of the revenue from the actual production can go directly to Community Theatre of Little Rock. CTLR will be celebrating its 60th season here in Central Arkansas. The revenue generated from this production will give an added boost to the quality of shows we plan for the 60th and beyond.</span></p><p>If you have been involved in theatre on any level, you know that sets are used and reused again and again. The wear and tear on set flats, staircases, furniture, props, costumes, etc. can be very costly to the budget. So, new flats, among other necessary items, will help refresh the look and feel of future productions for years to come.  It is my hope, that the funds we raise here on IndieGoGo for this show will help provide CTLR with new flats, furniture and other needed essentials that they haven't had for a number of years. </p><p>So your donations will help us two fold: We will be able to have flats, furniture, etc. for our World Premiere Production of ""The Winning Numbers"" and CTLR will have new equipment to use for many years to come. </p><h3>Synopsis of “The Winning Numbers”</h3><p>“The buzz around the offices of Dingle, Martin and Associates is ‘the state lottery is at an all time high.’ For employees like Emily and Max, winning the lottery would mean comfort and happiness. For Roberta, it would mean a better education for her twin sons. Louie would finally be able to buy that house he’s always wanted. Scott could really get ahead of the curve. And for Stacy and Brewster, it might even mean wedding bells. But when things don’t go as planned, and the employees start plotting against each other.""<br/></p><h4>UPDATE: Nov 15, 2014:</h4>The Cast and Crew of ""The Winning Numbers"" met at cast member Bob Bidewell's house to have a preliminary read through of the script. This was a chance for everyone to meet and get to know each other. We laughed a lot and began delving into the script. We have a number of veteran actors/actresses in the cast as well as a few new folks. I asked each of them for their reaction to reading the script together as a cast. Here's what they had to say...<br/><br/><p><i>Jennifer Baltzley (Stacy) said ""Feeling so honored to be cast with such amazing talent!  It's going to be a great show!  Can't wait!""</i></p><p><i>Chris Miller-Marshall (Louie) said ""I knew I needed to be a part of the show after a few pages and uncountable chuckles.""</i></p><p><i>Danny Troillett (Brewster) said ""Well-written and fun. Anyone want to go in on some Lottery tickets?""<br/><br/>Stacy Williams (Max) said </i></p><p><i>Jerry Woods (Alex) said ""Where are my lines?""</i></p><p><i>Liz Turner (Emily) said ""The characters are lovable and real. *sneeze*""</i></p><p><i>Kevin Crumpler (Randall) said ""That will buy a lot of happiness!""</i></p><p><i>Brent Wood (Scott) said  ""The Winning Numbers is a hilarious script with an amusing take on coworker relationships and shenanigans within an office. Do not miss this show!""<br/></i></p><p><i>Roben Sullivant (Roberta) said ""I was simply thinking how awesome it was to be one of the 'chosen ones' to debut the show. It's well written and hilarious - AND, it's already a drinking game! 'Snort, snort, giggle!' I haven't laughed so hard in a long time!""</i></p><p><i>Tamara Boggs - Stage Manager said ""My husband's brilliant!""</i></p><h4><i>Here's what readers of the script had to say:</i></h4><p><i><i>Drama Teacher and Actress Jane Balgavy said ""Characters that are rich and real interact as we all do - and for one of them, a life changing piece of paper is all they need to change the game!""</i></i></p><p><i><i><i>Horror Fiction Writer Kat Yars said ""The Winning Numbers will keep you laughing from the opening to the very twisted ending. Well developed characters and plot lines will keep you guessing what will happen next. A great play, I cannot wait to see on the stage.""</i></i></i></p><p><i><i><i>Director and Actor Frank O. Butler said ""It's an interesting look at greed, and how it can blind you of many things if you're not careful. It has characters from different walks of life with different motives as to why winning the lottery is important, even if it's a one-in-a-million longshot. I think audiences will definitely identify with at least one of these characters during the course of the show.""</i></i></i></p><p><i><i><i>Film Maker and Actress Jess Carson said ""It's a quirky, fun and engaging piece of writing that will be sure to keep the audience engaged and in giggle fits.""</i></i></i></p><p><i><i><i>Film Maker Nick ""CK"" Helms said ""With The Winning Numbers, Mr. Boggs has crafted an excellent tale of a seemingly typical office group who band together to try and win the lottery in order to get out of their mundane lives. You can't help but match the characters up with people that you may have worked with in the past and it just makes the story even more humorous. I would definitely recommend this to others in hopes that they will enjoy it as much as I did.""</i></i></i></p><p><i><i><i>Playwright Betsy Kelso said ""In a time of such great financial uncertainty for so many, Chris Boggs has tapped into some truly relevant and compelling themes with 'The Winning Numbers.'""</i></i></i></p><p><i><i><i>Drama Professor and Actor Tom McLeod said ""...kept me guessing till the very end!""</i></i></i></p><p><i><i><i>Actress Lori Ann Freda said ""Boggs has created a lighthearted, funny play that is clever and entertaining! A whimsical story of office life and dreams of winning big! This is definitely a crowd-pleaser! Can't wait for the masses to enjoy this great piece!""</i></i></i></p><p><i><i><i>Persona</i><i>l friend Melissa Berkey said ""</i></i></i></p><h3><i><i><b><br/>About Community Theatre of Little Rock</b></i></i></h3><p>  ""Founded in 1956, Community Theatre of Little Rock (CTLR) is Central Arkansas' oldest and finest theatre tradtion. CTLR is a nonprofit, volunteer organization striving to enlighten, educate and entertain our community.</p><p>Since its inception, CTLR has performed in many venues in Little Rock, Arkansas. In the very early years, The Perish Hall at 9th and Louisiana, Trinity Parish Hall, Robinson Auditorium, a renovated feed store at 609 Center Street and The Medical Center Auditorium provided performance stages. In the 1960’s and 1970’s, National Investors Life Building, the Arkansas Arts Center, Student Union became our venues. The 1980’s found us performing again in the Arkansas Arts Center, UALR, the Excelsior Hotel, The Arkansas Repertory Theatre, Little Rock Garden Council and Hall High School. Capitol Keyboard Theatre became our home until the Arkansas School for the Blind offered us the use of Woolly Auditorium beginning our 2002-2003 season. The 2008-2009 season was an exciting time for CTLR, as we moved to The PUBLIC Theatre downtown.

Christopher Boggs. I have been an actor/director/producer and writer within the Little Rock theatre community for a number of years. In late January of 2014, I came up with a crazy idea for a play and pitched it to my wife. She loved it and encouraged me to start fleshing the story out. Roughly a month later, ""The Winning Numbers"" (TWN) was finished. I reluctantly put the script down for a while, but then quickly picked it up again and began fine tuning it.  It has been my good fortune to be a member of Community Theatre of Little Rock (CTLR) and even more fortunate that TWN was considered for their 2014-15 season. The weekend of April 24th-26th 2015, TWN will have its World Premiere performances at The Studio Theatre, where Community Theatre of Little Rock currently performs. A special VIP show will be held on April 23rd. I can not tell you how excited, nervous, elated and stressed out I have been over the past year and how excited, nervous, elated and stressed I am about the next couple of months (AHHHHH!!!). The cast and crew of ""The Winning Numbers"", along with Community Theatre of Little Rock, are seeking support from donors like you. Donation will go to help offset the cost of building our set, purchasing costume pieces and props, handling publicity, etc., so that all of the revenue from the actual production can go directly to Community Theatre of Little Rock. CTLR will be celebrating its 60th season here in Central Arkansas. The revenue generated from this production will give an added boost to the quality of shows we plan for the 60th and beyond.If you have been involved in theatre on any level, you know that sets are used and reused again and again. The wear and tear on set flats, staircases, furniture, props, costumes, etc. can be very costly to the budget. So, new flats, among other necessary items, will help refresh the look and feel of future productions for years to come.  It is my hope, that the funds we raise here on IndieGoGo for this show will help provide CTLR with new flats, furniture and other needed essentials that they haven't had for a number of years. So your donations will help us two fold: We will be able to have flats, furniture, etc. for our World Premiere Production of ""The Winning Numbers"" and CTLR will have new equipment to use for many years to come. Synopsis of “The Winning Numbers”“The buzz around the offices of Dingle, Martin and Associates is ‘the state lottery is at an all time high.’ For employees like Emily and Max, winning the lottery would mean comfort and happiness. For Roberta, it would mean a better education for her twin sons. Louie would finally be able to buy that house he’s always wanted. Scott could really get ahead of the curve. And for Stacy and Brewster, it might even mean wedding bells. But when things don’t go as planned, and the employees start plotting against each other.""UPDATE: Nov 15, 2014:The Cast and Crew of ""The Winning Numbers"" met at cast member Bob Bidewell's house to have a preliminary read through of the script. This was a chance for everyone to meet and get to know each other. We laughed a lot and began delving into the script. We have a number of veteran actors/actresses in the cast as well as a few new folks. I asked each of them for their reaction to reading the script together as a cast. Here's what they had to say...Jennifer Baltzley (Stacy) said ""Feeling so honored to be cast with such amazing talent!  It's going to be a great show!  Can't wait!""Chris Miller-Marshall (Louie) said ""I knew I needed to be a part of the show after a few pages and uncountable chuckles.""Danny Troillett (Brewster) said ""Well-written and fun. Anyone want to go in on some Lottery tickets?""Stacy Williams (Max) said Jerry Woods (Alex) said ""Where are my lines?""Liz Turner (Emily) said ""The characters are lovable and real. *sneeze*""Kevin Crumpler (Randall) said ""That will buy a lot of happiness!""Brent Wood (Scott) said  ""The Winning Numbers is a hilarious script with an amusing take on coworker relationships and shenanigans within an office. Do not miss this show!""Roben Sullivant (Roberta) said ""I was simply thinking how awesome it was to be one of the 'chosen ones' to debut the show. It's well written and hilarious - AND, it's already a drinking game! 'Snort, snort, giggle!' I haven't laughed so hard in a long time!""Tamara Boggs - Stage Manager said ""My husband's brilliant!""Here's what readers of the script had to say:Drama Teacher and Actress Jane Balgavy said ""Characters that are rich and real interact as we all do - and for one of them, a life changing piece of paper is all they need to change the game!""Horror Fiction Writer Kat Yars said ""The Winning Numbers will keep you laughing from the opening to the very twisted ending. Well developed characters and plot lines will keep you guessing what will happen next. A great play, I cannot wait to see on the stage.""Director and Actor Frank O. Butler said ""It's an interesting look at greed, and how it can blind you of many things if you're not careful. It has characters from different walks of life with different motives as to why winning the lottery is important, even if it's a one-in-a-million longshot. I think audiences will definitely identify with at least one of these characters during the course of the show.""Film Maker and Actress Jess Carson said ""It's a quirky, fun and engaging piece of writing that will be sure to keep the audience engaged and in giggle fits.""Film Maker Nick ""CK"" Helms said ""With The Winning Numbers, Mr. Boggs has crafted an excellent tale of a seemingly typical office group who band together to try and win the lottery in order to get out of their mundane lives. You can't help but match the characters up with people that you may have worked with in the past and it just makes the story even more humorous. I would definitely recommend this to others in hopes that they will enjoy it as much as I did.""Playwright Betsy Kelso said ""In a time of such great financial uncertainty for so many, Chris Boggs has tapped into some truly relevant and compelling themes with 'The Winning Numbers.'""Drama Professor and Actor Tom McLeod said ""...kept me guessing till the very end!""Actress Lori Ann Freda said ""Boggs has created a lighthearted, funny play that is clever and entertaining! A whimsical story of office life and dreams of winning big! This is definitely a crowd-pleaser! Can't wait for the masses to enjoy this great piece!""Personal friend Melissa Berkey said ""About Community Theatre of Little Rock  ""Founded in 1956, Community Theatre of Little Rock (CTLR) is Central Arkansas' oldest and finest theatre tradtion. CTLR is a nonprofit, volunteer organization striving to enlighten, educate and entertain our community.Since its inception, CTLR has performed in many venues in Little Rock, Arkansas.

In the 1960’s and 1970’s, National Investors Life Building, the Arkansas Arts Center, Student Union became our venues. The 1980’s found us performing again in the Arkansas Arts Center, UALR, the Excelsior Hotel, The Arkansas Repertory Theatre, Little Rock Garden Council and Hall High School. Capitol Keyboard Theatre became our home until the Arkansas School for the Blind offered us the use of Woolly Auditorium beginning our 2002-2003 season. The 2008-2009 season was an exciting time for CTLR, as we moved to The PUBLIC Theatre downtown. On July 1st, 2014, CLTR moved into The Studio Theatre on 7th Street.We continue to provide our community with live theatrical productions of the highest quality, as well as, providing opportunities for talented people of all ages to perform and participate in every phase of producing live theatre.”How You Can Help:Please consider donating to our fund raising efforts.

<div>Thank you visiting our IndieGoGo fundraising page. Your time is greatly appreciated and we hope to have your support on our project. My name is Aaron Langford and I am the writer and director of ThreeWay, which is the sixth play that I've wrote. I began by co-writing a play four years ago that was about bullying and mental health issues. O2 awarded me £300 to create it and tour it around schools in the North East of England, which resulted in the project receiving an Anti-Bullying award. After the success of the project, I was later awarded another £2,500 from O2 for a new play, which was a sinister twist on the fairy tale Cinderella that also explored mental health issues. This was staged 2 years ago at the renowned Sage Gateshead in their 600 seater venue. Since then, I have wrote another 4 plays, which collectively have covered many issues, including mental health issues, existentialism and romance. My last play Lunaria was staged last year at the Woking Youth Arts Centre through the kind support of Peer Productions.<span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span><h3>About ThreeWay</h3></span>
</div>
<div>ThreeWay is a new, innovative piece of theatre that offers a new perspective into the world of dating, relationships and mental health. It explores these topics through comedy and reveals a polyamorous relationship that accidentally unfolds between three people, none of whom identity as this. ThreeWay's part-verbatim quirky, witty and relatable to all, regardless of sexuality, and with the combination of awkward comedy and situations, it aims to have the audience laughing out loud throughout. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>This project is important to me/us because we believe that dating has actually became terrifying for so many people these days. With the rise of applications such as Tinder and Plenty of Fish that dehumanise the whole process, it's not hard to work out why. ThreeWay highlights this with comedy and exposes awkward situations that most of us might be far too familiar with... Ever tried to act really cool in front of someone you like, only to fail miserably and come off looking like a creep? I have... So much so that I've lost count.  </div>
<div>ThreeWay now contains a dark, unexpected twist that will keep you on the edge of your seat! This is to highlight our other issue of mental health, which is not talked about enough. I'm sure you all know someone who suffers and many others still suffer in silence. For this reason, it is so important that ThreeWay is staged so it can make everyone have a great experience and also help those who need it.  </div>

</div><div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><p>There is always the potential for problems when creating and touring a show. However, the important thing is to ensure safeguards are in place to prevent or minimise them. </p>
<p>Our biggest concern is not reaching our total funding goal, it was originally £3,000. However, we were presented with the opportunity of extending our show from 5 shows to 13, which meant our budget was increased to £3,500.  Your generous<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> support on Kickstarter, has made sure that we only need £2648 now. </span></p>
<p>In terms of finding this cost, I have successfully raised this amount in past projects.

Our performances of ThreeWay will be held at Spotlites, Venue 278 at the Royal Society of Edinburgh at The Create Theatre. These will be from Thursday 4th of August until Saturday 13th August. 


All contributions are extremely appreciated.Every little contribution makes a massive difference. Without the support we have had so far, we would not have been able to secure our venue at the exquisite and beautiful Royal Society of Edinburgh building, managed by award-winning company Spotlites in August 2016. With your support you will be ensuring this project goes ahead at EdFringe 2016. We may have secured the venue but we still have such a long way to go, as the budget below shows. Costs include monthly payments for the venue, travel costs and general expenses, such as accommodation and equipment for the project.     What We Need & What You Get
We currently need just over £2,500 pounds. We know this may seem like a lot but we believe we have something worth funding. We are confident that we can do it with your help and have already received funding from O2 Think Big!
Venue Cost - £948.00
Travel Costs for cast and equipment - £500
Accommodation Costs - £1,200
Total = £2,648
So, let's talk about the perks you will get for supporting us!
£5.00 - A Thank You card for your support. 
£10.00 - A Thank You card + A gift for your support. 
£20.00 - A Thank You card + A gift + A mention in our shows programme, for your support.

Risks & Challenges

There is always the potential for problems when creating and touring a show. However, the important thing is to ensure safeguards are in place to prevent or minimise them. 
Our biggest concern is not reaching our total funding goal, it was originally £3,000. However, we were presented with the opportunity of extending our show from 5 shows to 13, which meant our budget was increased to £3,500.  Your generous support on Kickstarter, has made sure that we only need £2648 now. 
In terms of finding this cost, I have successfully raised this amount in past projects. I've been very lucky to have had these opportunities over time it has given me the skills necessary to not only create a show but also manage and produce one. I started off by co-writing a play three years ago that was about mental health issues, which toured schools and I was awarded £300 from 02 to create after I won an Anti-Bullying award for it. After the success of the project, I was later awarded another £2,500 for a new play that was a sinister twist on the fairy tale Cinderella, which also explored mental health issues. This was staged about 2 years ago at a 600 seat venue. In recent years, I have wrote 4 more plays, which have collectively covered my issues, including mental health issues, existentialism and romance. My last play was staged last year at the Woking Youth Arts Centre through the kind support of Peer Productions. O2 Think Big have also offered their support again in ThreeWay, which is brilliant and we are very excited about it. 
This isn't our only funding option though, we will also have very exciting funding ideas in the coming weeks. Keep a look out!  Other Ways You Can Help Sharing is immensely useful for us to get the word out, if you can share it, then please do. We really appreciate it!
Tell everyone you can, word of mouth is a great way for us to gain more supporters. 
We could also really use your support to help us fundraise too, any assistance with events would be brilliant!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Who We Are:The Women’s Voices Theater Group was created solely to bring awareness to these types of issues. We are a collaborative group of women using the stage as a platform to bring awareness to violence against women and give a voice to those in need.
What We Do: 
Women's Voices Theater Group producers Lindsay Lucas-Bartlett, Nino D. Gordeli and Tori-Ann Hampton are honored to join V-Day's One Billion Rising with a theater production of  Eve Ensler's The Vagina Monologues, not only to raise awareness to the devastating number of human trafficking victims, but also to raise funds for Bishop Outreach Human Trafficking Rescue, a non-profit organization that helps rescue and rehabilitate women who have been subjected to sex trafficking.
Money raised through this production will be used to aid in the efforts of rescuing and rehabilitating victims of sex trafficking. 
Cast:


This year we are excited to welcome to our ranks a fantastic lineup of women. To name only a few, we are proud to work with Grace and Frankie's Suzanne Ford, Home and Away's Esther Anderson, Siberia's Sabina Akhmedova, Swans Crossing's Stacey Moseley, as well as Harriet Wallace, Genevieve Kennedy and Deanna Noe, among others.


 


Director:
Nino D. Gordeli primarily works in film but her passion for theater and the cause brought her back to the stage. 
 ""It feels like coming home because theater is where I started,"" says Nino.

She has directed/produced a number of documentaries, shorts, TV Shows, theater productions and her latest feature as writer/producer is in post production under working title ""Titus"".
""Vagina Monologues is personal, every monologue, regardless of the story behind.   I am every woman, this is my story, and I'd like to share it with you!""
 

What We Need:
The producers, the director and the cast are dedicating their time and talent for free, but we still need money for the production expenses, like rehearsal space, theater rental, tech personnel, and printing promotional materials etc... 

What You Get:
Thanks to our great sponsors we have amazing incentives for you: - hand crafted jewelry from GiftinForFifteen and Bornnomadic- gift cards from LA's local restaurants- gift bags that contain VDAY and WV Theater Group merchandise- tickets to the show, signed goodies from the cast,- and lots and lots of cyber gratitude, love and fantastic karma as well as the knowledge you are helping a truly wonderful cause.

<h3>Unequally Yoked, Written &amp; Directed by </h3>
<div>Lynette J. Blackwell.  <p></p>
<p>Who doesn't love the theater?  A place where you can go to get away from the world.  Where laughter can be heard, and the smiles and tears of the audience can be witnessed.  I have been a fan, from musicals to dramas, and have found myself immersed in many adventures.</p>
<p>The day that I called myself a Playwright opened my eyes to another world.  But the moment that my play Unequally Yoked graced the stage in 2012... That changed my life forever.  Since its inception, I have been blessed to produce Unequally Yoked in the NY Tri-State area, and it has been enjoyed by audiences of different ethnicities, genders and ages.  We have an opportunity to take Unequally Yoked on the road, to Dothan Alabama, the peanut capital of the world.  </p>
<p>We are to arrive in Dothan on April 15th at the Historical Opera House, and at this time we are slated for 2 shows (Prayerfully more will be added)...</p>

<p><b>Synopsis </b></p>
<p><b>What has Franklin Regis gotten into? In  </b><b><i>Unequally Yoked!, </i>life is proving to be quite a </b><b>challenge for him as the newly appointed pastor </b><b>of the Church of Genesis to Revelations. Saddled </b><b>with an unruly flock, cuckolded by a dazzling new </b><b>wife with unholy aspirations and faced with </b><b>saving a family legacy that is quickly unraveling, </b><b>Pastor Regis finds himself stuck between a rock </b><b>and a hard place.</b></p>
<p><b>What People Are Saying About Unequally Yoked</b></p>
<p><b>Pat Cousar-Amsterdam News NYC</b></p>
<p>If the dress rehearsal for Lynette Blackwell’s spiritual stage play “Unequally Yoked” is indicative of the full ensemble, then she is truly on the road to becoming an excellent playwright and director. </p>
<p>Her debut with a live audience will be Friday, March 27. Staged at the National Black Theater, the show will run four days for a total of eight shows. The cast is exciting and musically talented, and the musical arrangement will uplift the audience. The spiritual stage play is produced by Harlem’s own Rob Base, who brought us hits such as “Get on the Dance Floor” and the all-time favorite, “It Takes Two,” as well as the historic “Joy and Pain.”</p>
<p>Blackwell’s play is a tale of relationship woes through betrayal, forgiveness and hope. It is inspirational and speaks to various life dynamics. Blackwell told the AmNews her inspiration for writing the play came out of her own personal struggles of being in a marriage that was unequally yoked. “I was in church service one day and it came to me so clear—‘Unequally Yoked’,” she said. “I wrote it down in a book and tucked it away. I didn't know what exactly God was telling me. I kept writing, and then I realized that God was speaking to me. I wrote when God told me and when he didn’t, I didn’t.”</p>
<p>Base came to the set and spoke with the AmNews. He expressed excitement about the play. “I’ve been looking for something different to do for a long time,” he said. “When I saw it for the first time, I said to myself let me jump in and get behind this play.” </p>
<p>Talented and Gifted! Had the pleasure of checking out ""Unequally Yolked"" Written and Directed by Lynette Blackwell and it was amazing. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/april.mayroberts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">April May</a> as ""Lola"" was hilarious. She may have enjoyed that part a bit too much though. Lol. Go check it out folks.. You won't regret it!  <b>I. Grigg </b></p>
<p>An inspiring production about the power of forgiveness.  The unseen hope and love found only through Christ.  A play that doesn’t weary the eyes, but inspires our heart.  <b>D. Collington </b></p>
<p>A big shout out to the cast from the play Unequally Yoked, especially Lynette Blackwell  I am glad that I got to see all your hard work pay off!!!  Can’t wait ti see what is next. <b>D. Thompson </b></p>
<p>What can I say… I am so very proud of you and what God is doing in your life.  The play was awesome!!!  <b>S. Bueford-Wilder </b></p>
<p>We had a VERY good time at the show.  Michael’s favorite is Ice Pick.  Thank you Lynette Blackwell for a nice Sunday evening.  <b>T. Ingram </b></p>
<p>This was a fantastic play, there wasn’t a dull moment.  It was like an emotional roller coaster it made you wanna laugh, tear up, and think about what would happen next.  It gives you a little old and new school, capturing the interest of all generations, and at the same time sending a message and an eye opener to leadership and the saints of God.  Lynette is truly gifted!  <b>I Mclean </b></p>
<p>I had the opportunity to attend this play on last evening.  It was awesome.  The actors and actresses were superb.  The play gives a full analogy of what Pastor groupies do.  it’s scenes drew the audience to interact with the actors during the theatrical performance.  More than a timely drama about leadership tension, but a spiritually potent story that portrays people looking toward a better life.  it creeped in on me slowly, by degrees.  I was hardly aware of it until that moment when i couldn’t even stand to be around the subtitled devices of satan, and i started grumbling because “Lola was off to he next victim.  Lynette Blackwell; you have proven yourself to be a playwright!  <b>E Piccola Foster-Lewis</b></p>
<p>It was a spiritual, humorous, heartfelt and just flat out reality play. It was easy to relate to the characters because in life we all know someone just like the characters presented. I chuckled, praise God, and laughed extremely hard while watching this play. It's a must go see! You will walk out at the end of the show still chuckling shaking your head!  <b>R. Eddy </b></p>

<p>Since its inception in late 2015, The Bipeds Dance Company, under the direction of dancer/choreographer Stacy Wolfson and banjo player/ songwriter Curtis Eller, has thrived in the pursuit of genuine collaboration. Performers of various disciplines are brought together to seek out the elusive flashes of inspiration that flare up where their disparate techniques intersect.<br/>Wolfson and Eller have devised a unique compositional approach that seamlessly combines movement, music and lyrics to create a peculiar and compelling hybrid of dance and song. They cast the finished pieces with dancers and musicians possessing the curiosity, technical proficiency and requisite disdain for boundaries to delve into one another's mediums. Musicians become dancers, dancers become singers, and unhinged howls of wild abandon are briefly and inevitably reconciled with harmony and grace.<br/>The Bipeds make their theatrical debut in June 2016 with the evening- length, ""Never Enough Better Nothing"" in conjunction with Eller's rock &amp; roll band The American Circus on June 3-4, 2016.</p>

Musicians become dancers, dancers become singers, and unhinged howls of wild abandon are briefly and inevitably reconciled with harmony and grace.The Bipeds make their theatrical debut in June 2016 with the evening- length, ""Never Enough Better Nothing"" in conjunction with Eller's rock & roll band The American Circus on June 3-4, 2016.

CHI SIAMO

La prima italiana di ""Romeo&Juliet Post Scriptum"" di Annika Nyman è andata in scena il 20 Maggio 2015 al Teatro dell'Orologio di Roma con Giovanni Anzaldo e Selene Gandini e la mia regia, ed è stata una bellissima esperienza.
In particolare per me, il lavoro di traduzione fatto con Annika dallo svedese all'inglese e poi all'italiano è stato una sfida molto interessante e stimolante. Annika è poi venuta a Roma a vedere il nostro lavoro e per fortuna le è piaciuto molto.
Adesso abbiamo l'opportunità di portare lo spettacolo, al Festival Fringe di Edimburgo il prossimo Agosto; abbiamo uno degli spazi migliori, il Teatro 1 al theSpace on the Mile (http://www.thespaceuk.com/edinburgh/thespaces-o...), ma per impegni precedenti Giovanni e Selene non potranno esserci e passeranno il testimone a una nuova coppia di altrettanto validi attori madrelingua inglese, Sara Lazzaro e Francesco Petruzzelli.
Ora dobbiamo rimettere in prova lo spettacolo e debuttare al meglio ad Edimburgo!
Ecco perché chiediamo il vostro aiuto :-)
grazie a tutti,
Georgia 


ROMEO E GIULIETTA Post Scriptum- note di regia
Non è facile scrivere due righe sul perché ci si appassiona a un progetto.
Già la passione ha in sé poco di ragionato e molto di istintivo, quando poi si tratta di Shakespeare per me è quasi impossibile trovare una spiegazione razionale.
E' come un eterno, inspiegabile, ineluttabile, immutato amore.
Un po' come quello di Romeo e Giulietta, appunto.
E gli star-crossed lovers per eccellenza, destinati ad ""amarsi a morte"" nei secoli dei secoli in qualunque forma d'arte conosciuta, hanno sempre avuto la mia attenzione speciale.
Impossibile non appassionarmi al testo (e alla testa!) di Annika Nyman, giovane autrice venuta dal freddo, che li fa sopravvivere alle intenzioni di Shakespeare pur non tradendolo mai nei contenuti.
Tutti prima o poi ci siamo domandati che cosa accadrebbe se Romeo e Giulietta non morissero.
Ma se così fosse, sarebbero vivi? O sarebbero dei sopravvissuti..?

ROMEO & JULIET Post Scriptum- Director's Note


It's not easy to write a few lines about why one becomes passionate about a project.
Passion itself knows little reason and its moved by instinct, and when it's about Shakespeare, it's very nearly impossible for me to be rational about it. It's an atavistic love, unexplainable, undeniable, unchanging.



It's a bit like that between Romeo and Juliet, indeed.
And I've always had a special interest in the star-crossed lovers, destined to love each other to death through the centuries and through all art forms.
How could I not get passionate about Annika Nyman's play (and mind!). The young author who comes from a cold country, makes them survive Shakespeare's intended ending, never betraying his writing.



We've all asked ourselves, at one time or other, what would happen if Romeo and Juliet didn't die.



But if they did, would they be alive or would they be survivors?

</blockquote></div>","Who am I?
My name is Marcelina. I'm 19. I can't remember exactly when my dance journey began. At the age of 8 I joined a local dance group (TESS) in Tarnowskie Góry. At the beginning I treated dance just as fun. With time it evolved into my passion. Visits to a ballet room became my daily routine. After some time hard work started to pay off and bring me not only satisfaction but also trophies.




What is so special about dancing?Human body is capable of showing a lot emotions without using any words. Dancing is an amazing art of movement. It enables me to keep harmony in everyday life and express positive and negative emotional states. Actually, I can not imagine my life without dancing. It would be empty.



What is the goal of this fundraiser?Earlier this month I attended workshops with instructors from one of the best European dance academies in Munchen - Iwanson International School of Contemporary Dance. They noticed me and proposed an education at Iwanson without getting auditioned. It is an amazing opportunity to become a proffesional dancer which I always wanted to be. Unfortunately, living expances and school fees are too high for me to meet. My parents can't fully cover expected expenses. My mother is unemployed due to health problems. That's why I need your help.


Monthly expences: 
300 euro - dormitory400 euro - living expances550 euro - school fees


= 1250 euro

A full year of studying in Munich costs 15000 euro.


Every cent counts. Make it possible!You can also help me by using the sharing tools available on this page to spread a word about my fundraiser .Thank you very much!
This campaign is ended, but I created another one. Here you can find it:

<p><span>I'm a California native, SFSU graduate, and the regional director of CORE40 fitness studios in San Francisco. I have a genuine interest for people, which includes those experiencing homelessness. I've spent time and money feeding the homeless and buying ""Street Sheets"" for over 7 years, but I've always known that one day I would do more to help. </span></p>
<p><span>In a city like San Francisco where the divide between rich and poor continues to grow, the disconnected homeless population cannot afford to be castaways any longer. Homecoming SF is part community event, dance party, and fundraiser for the homeless.</span></p>
<p><span>I aim to celebrate the human gift of self expression through dance, music, and play with the entire community; not a select few. Redefining homelessness is a process that starts with understanding the power of self-worth and awareness.</span></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need </h3> <p>My goal is to raise $100,000 before the Homecoming dance event in October. The funds raised will be used in the following ways:</p>
<p>1. Self-care packages with tangible items such as soap, socks, facial wipes, nail clippers, iPod shuffles, warm socks, &amp; more for 1,000 homeless people in San Francisco.</p>
<p>2. Donation to Project Homeless Connect of San Francisco. PHC provides everyday services to individuals experiencing homelessness. ""These services include dental care, eyeglasses, HIV testing, housing information, food, hygiene products, medical care, mental health services, SSI benefits, legal advice, California identification cards, voice mail accounts, employment counseling/job placement, wheelchair repair, addiction services, and more.""</p>
<p>3. Donation to HandUp. HU allows users to donate directly to homeless neighbors in need. </p>
<p>How it works:</p>
<p> - Members in need sign up directly through community partners (like Project Homeless Connect). </p>
<p>- Donors contribute directly to member goals.</p>
<p>- Members redeem their funds for basic needs.</p>
<p>4. The Homecoming dance will include performances, dance lessons, live music, and vendors. Everyone supporting the cause will be taking part in a new kind of social service; a service centered around music, dance, and play. </p>
<p>The event and any funds raised are 100% not for profit. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>With an abundance of non-profits seeking funding for their well-worthy agendas, it can be easy to oversee the good you can do for your very own community right in your own backyard. Not only will your contribution to Homecoming fuel an idea, it will benefit a human being you've crossed paths with many times before. The person that could have been you. </p>
<p>I've travelled to numerous poverty stricken regions (India, Ghana, Burkina Faso just to name a few), but the division of wealth here in San Francisco is unlike anything I've ever seen. There are over 6,000 homeless people experiencing homelessness in San Francisco today.</p>
<p>In short, non-profit organizations like Project Homeless Connect are the future of transitioning people out of homelessness. With self-care comes self-worth, which is what medical, hygiene, and  personal services provide for humans; these services are the only innate differences between a modern era and an ancient one. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>The cause &amp; cure of homelessness is a topic big enough to hold an ocean. By starting somewhere and with a goal of self expression, an event like Homecoming can make a huge impact on attitudes towards homelessness in San Francisco. I aim to humanize the experience of homelessness in a way that everyone can relate to: dance, play, laughter, and music.</div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you aren't in a place to contribute monetarily, spreading the word is like gold. Please share the Indiegogo link and event with your friends &amp; social networks to foster engagement and contributions.</p>
<p>I'm also seeking volunteers for the Homecoming event in October (venue &amp; date TBA). If you are an artist, dancer, or musician and wish to share your art for the cause, please get in touch with me at madsford22@gmail.com and tell me a little about yourself. </p>
<p>When tickets go on sale for Homecoming, all proceeds will go to Project Homeless Connect. Please ""like"" the Homecoming Facebook page for updates on our epic venue &amp; event details!</p>

4. The Homecoming dance will include performances, dance lessons, live music, and vendors. Everyone supporting the cause will be taking part in a new kind of social service; a service centered around music, dance, and play. 
The event and any funds raised are 100% not for profit. 
    The Impact With an abundance of non-profits seeking funding for their well-worthy agendas, it can be easy to oversee the good you can do for your very own community right in your own backyard. Not only will your contribution to Homecoming fuel an idea, it will benefit a human being you've crossed paths with many times before. The person that could have been you. 
I've travelled to numerous poverty stricken regions (India, Ghana, Burkina Faso just to name a few), but the division of wealth here in San Francisco is unlike anything I've ever seen. There are over 6,000 homeless people experiencing homelessness in San Francisco today.
In short, non-profit organizations like Project Homeless Connect are the future of transitioning people out of homelessness. With self-care comes self-worth, which is what medical, hygiene, and  personal services provide for humans; these services are the only innate differences between a modern era and an ancient one. 
    Risks & Challenges
The cause & cure of homelessness is a topic big enough to hold an ocean. By starting somewhere and with a goal of self expression, an event like Homecoming can make a huge impact on attitudes towards homelessness in San Francisco. I aim to humanize the experience of homelessness in a way that everyone can relate to: dance, play, laughter, and music.
    Other Ways You Can Help If you aren't in a place to contribute monetarily, spreading the word is like gold. Please share the Indiegogo link and event with your friends & social networks to foster engagement and contributions.
I'm also seeking volunteers for the Homecoming event in October (venue & date TBA). If you are an artist, dancer, or musician and wish to share your art for the cause, please get in touch with me at madsford22@gmail.com and tell me a little about yourself. 
When tickets go on sale for Homecoming, all proceeds will go to Project Homeless Connect. Please ""like"" the Homecoming Facebook page for updates on our epic venue & event details!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","The Play
A one woman, one act play written by C. R. Giles, The Also-Ran will premiere at this year's Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

Performing at:
Surgeons' Hall, Theatre 3, Edinburgh.
Monday 17th August - Saturday 22nd August 2015 (15.10 - 15.50)



(""Adam Lindsay Gordon - Melbourne monument"" by Paul Raphael Montford) 


Inspired by the life of 19th century poet-rebel Adam Lindsay Gordon, The Also-Ran gives voice to his long lost sweetheart Jane Brydges who recounts their lives together and apart, retelling the bittersweet highs and tragic lows of the maverick horse-rider turned bush ballad-monger whose talents may have lain elsewhere. 

The unheard past is brought to life and made anew in a soliloquy of lost imaginings and unfulfilled desire as Gordon’s lover comes to terms with the choices she made and the consequences she faced.

From the Writer: 
Having grown up in the Brydges' family farmhouse, Jane and Lindsay's love affair became an integral part of my childhood mythology. After years of research and many false starts I have finally found the perspective from which to tell their story and am at the stage of putting the play upon its feet.
I am reconciled to the fact that my writing is better then my own acting ability so it is time to hand the play over to those who can bring it alive with a little more panache. I have been helped by a wonderfully generous team of creatives and I am campaigning here to ensure that we can produce the best work possible and can give those artists the best possible support.



What We Need:
So far we have raised the money to hire the venue and secure the festival registration. Having taken advantage of family goodwill in order to cover accommodation we are still looking to raise the target amount of £2,500 which will be used to pay the following (and is inclusive of Indiegogo fees):

Any contribution, however small or outrageously big, will be gratefully received; please do see the perks should you prefer carrots to sticks. We appreciate that giving hard cash is not always possible but if we could persuade you to spread the word about The Also-Ran to friends and strangers alike then the bums on seats, and general buzz, will be generosity enough.

be the largest youth theater in the nation and is a non-profit 501(c)3
educational organization funded primarily through its tuition, ticket sales,
and outside contributions.</p>
<p>Mission

<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Our
annual budget pays for costumes, sets, props, sound, lights, rental of theaters
and classroom space, teacher stipends, artistic team stipends, curriculum
writing and design, royalties and many other training and production costs.
Only about 80% of the total comes from ticket sales and tuition and fees. CYT
must raise support to ensure that all the productions and student programs are
adequately funded. Philanthropic support is also critical to CYT to continue to
make the program affordable. CYT has made a conscious effort to keep both
tuition and ticket prices low, often providing scholarships, in order to make
the program accessible for families throughout the Middle Tennessee area.
Without charitable support, the CYT program could not be sustained at a
reasonable cost to the students. Because the CYT program involves a new group
of students every year – in addition to those who continue in the program – it
is critically important for CYT to generate consistent sources of revenue. CYT
is looking to the leaders of today, who truly believe that funds invested in
youth is an investment in our future, which goes to the heart of the CYT
mission. Charitable support allows CYT to grow and enhance the quality of the
training and productions. A gift to CYT is an investment with an established,
family-oriented organization that helps provide children a safe, wholesome environment
and provides them with skills to make better life choices and become positive
contributing members of their community.</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>We
have continued to increase registration as well as quality of our productions
in lighting, sound, props and sets; all of which that cost a great deal of
money. We had previously been offered a free place to call home for our
program. As we continue on to our next scene, we will be taking on new
expenses. We want to continue to grow in all aspects of our program but fear
that if we are not able to maintain a minimal amount in the bank then our
day-to-day expenses will not be kept up with. The money that we are asking for
will cover partial costs of facilities in order for us to maintain the budget
that was previously in place. All-in-all we are a non-profit organization that

our loyal patrons and to continue to grow and touch new members.</p>

<p>Hello dedicated artists or art lovers! We are the Artist's Sandbox and we are a New York ensemble that strives to awake and nurture the inner child in every artist, giving them the playground they need to feel artistically challenged in a safe and freeing environment. We are dedicated to establishing a hub for artists to work creatively and cohesively towards a sometimes uncommon goal.</p><p>Alex Nicholson, the Founder and Artistic Director of the Artist's Sandbox, came from Canada in 2011 to study at Circle in the Square Theatre School, where he graduated in 2013 with a concentration in musical theatre. He jumped right into the theatre scene, and has in the past 2 years performed in many different venues. However, he's now reached a point where he feels as though he's plateaued, simply because he's lost the artistic inspiration and drive that he had when he graduated. He recently realized that if he feels this way, there's probably a lot of other artists of many different persuasions, talents, and concentrations, who feel the same. So, he sat on it, and found a way that artists as a community could exercise their artistic brain in a way that isn't currently available. </p><p>Lets create a strictly non-union company where all artists come together. A company where a singer, an actor, a designer, a director, and a painter, could work together on a dance piece. By creating a structure where a company has many branches, it allows artists to either expand and grow from what they already love in a safe and nurturing environment OR try something new! Whether it be on your own, or with a mentor in another branch.</p><p>When you audition for this company and are invited in, you are a member of all branches. You may do a dance show one year, but then a straight play the next. We know that we can make a difference and create a path of artistic fulfillment for many people in this city.

</h1>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><b>INTRODUCTION</b></div>
<div><b>Hello everyone! Namaste! </b></div>
<div></div>
</div>We are delighted to introduce us to you, Theodorus Ramdjiet Kishna and Ronald Suresh Kishna, artists brothers • artistic directors @ Arangart® foundation in south India.  Born and grew up in Suriname-South America and in Amsterdam The Netherlands-West Europe. We studied in India, the original historical classical Bharata Natyam dance and music art. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We have dedicated a great part of our life to study, research and conservation of this stage art, created and codified by the ancient <b>Tanjore Quartet Art House</b> of traditional masters in dance and music, from which all forms take their source.</span><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In the past decades we have staged in Europe and India this comprehensive dance art, that is a union of several art forms; dance, music, the art of expression, drama, </span>costume and <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">make-up design. Now in India we established the non-profit art foundation Arangart® to document further this disappearing and valuable art, to provide a free dance education to talented children/youngsters without sufficient finance, stimulate talent of upcoming young dancers/artists, to collaborate with other art foundations and artists for cultural exchange and creative crossovers. The goal is to create a self sufficient low-cost-green atelier, a multiple studio-stage-costume-set design space.</span>
</div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p></p>
<div>With our South East Asian tour we aim to create awareness of this disappearing historical art, to introduce the art to wider audiences, the world of dance, and to make the art foundation Arangart visible.</div>
<div>
<p></p>
<p>We are in a fast world were many valuable traditional arts and crafts are disappearing or become unknown. The authentic school became artistically instant. The tranquility, well structured, strong, highly stylised and precise way of staging the art with an unpredictable choreography are a few features that are now lost. We began with the documentation of the dance choreographs and the tailor made music for the love of the art and due to above meant reasons. At first with the guidance of one of the last brilliant maestro's of the Tanjore Quartet Art House, the multiple awarded <b>Prof. Mr. K. P. Kittappa Pillai</b>, and after his demise in collaboration with his son master K. Chandrasekaran-Kittappa Pillai and the singer/musicians connected with the Tanjore Quartet Art House. </p>
<p></p>
<div>
<b>Your support is utmost important! </b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Continuation of this valuable traditional art  is needed to keep the art alive not only for the love of art but for the world of dance, to inspire and bring about the </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">UNLIMITED CREATIVITY</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> within us and within other artists around the world. Imagine how much new contemporary artwork can be created with a comprehensive art form developed with care and </span>nurtured<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> by </span>their<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> creators through the ages. Your contribution will make this multi creative project a success and will be a leap forward towards our other goals.</span>
<p></p>
<div><b>What do we need from our contributors around the world</b></div>
<div>As multi tasking artists, we are now in a start up position to make the aim of this project and Arangart visible. We are able to produce the designing work for costumes assisted by the upcoming young fashion designer Suresh Menon, promotional material, set design and editing the music ourselves. The live music is recorded and stored on the iPad. This reduces the expenses and makes it easy to travel with our art and a high quality “life” music. </div>
<div>
<p></p>
<p>To achieve our goal of this unique project a total amount of <b>$8450 US dollars</b> is at least needed. We have made an estimation of the expenses to prepare the project and expenses to carry out the project.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Preparation expenses: $3765</b></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Music recording: $728 -  rental music studio, adjusted fees vocalist, drummer, violin, conductor.    </li>
<li>Costumes: $1000 - 4 pieces of costumes - material and partly tailoring.</li>
<li>Set Design: material and making charges: $500</li>
<li>Make up material: $437</li>
<li>Studio rent: $600 - rehearsals </li>
<li>Promotional material: $500 - brochures, visiting cards, flyers, posters.</li>

INTRODUCTION
Hello everyone! Namaste! 

We are delighted to introduce us to you, Theodorus Ramdjiet Kishna and Ronald Suresh Kishna, artists brothers • artistic directors @ Arangart® foundation in south India.  Born and grew up in Suriname-South America and in Amsterdam The Netherlands-West Europe. We studied in India, the original historical classical Bharata Natyam dance and music art. We have dedicated a great part of our life to study, research and conservation of this stage art, created and codified by the ancient Tanjore Quartet Art House of traditional masters in dance and music, from which all forms take their source.
In the past decades we have staged in Europe and India this comprehensive dance art, that is a union of several art forms; dance, music, the art of expression, drama, costume and make-up design. Now in India we established the non-profit art foundation Arangart® to document further this disappearing and valuable art, to provide a free dance education to talented children/youngsters without sufficient finance, stimulate talent of upcoming young dancers/artists, to collaborate with other art foundations and artists for cultural exchange and creative crossovers. The goal is to create a self sufficient low-cost-green atelier, a multiple studio-stage-costume-set design space.


With our South East Asian tour we aim to create awareness of this disappearing historical art, to introduce the art to wider audiences, the world of dance, and to make the art foundation Arangart visible.


We are in a fast world were many valuable traditional arts and crafts are disappearing or become unknown. The authentic school became artistically instant. The tranquility, well structured, strong, highly stylised and precise way of staging the art with an unpredictable choreography are a few features that are now lost. We began with the documentation of the dance choreographs and the tailor made music for the love of the art and due to above meant reasons. At first with the guidance of one of the last brilliant maestro's of the Tanjore Quartet Art House, the multiple awarded Prof. Mr. K. P. Kittappa Pillai, and after his demise in collaboration with his son master K. Chandrasekaran-Kittappa Pillai and the singer/musicians connected with the Tanjore Quartet Art House. 


Your support is utmost important! Continuation of this valuable traditional art  is needed to keep the art alive not only for the love of art but for the world of dance, to inspire and bring about the UNLIMITED CREATIVITY within us and within other artists around the world. Imagine how much new contemporary artwork can be created with a comprehensive art form developed with care and nurtured by their creators through the ages. Your contribution will make this multi creative project a success and will be a leap forward towards our other goals.

What do we need from our contributors around the world
As multi tasking artists, we are now in a start up position to make the aim of this project and Arangart visible. We are able to produce the designing work for costumes assisted by the upcoming young fashion designer Suresh Menon, promotional material, set design and editing the music ourselves. The live music is recorded and stored on the iPad. This reduces the expenses and makes it easy to travel with our art and a high quality “life” music. 


To achieve our goal of this unique project a total amount of $8450 US dollars is at least needed. We have made an estimation of the expenses to prepare the project and expenses to carry out the project.

Preparation expenses: $3765


Music recording: $728 -  rental music studio, adjusted fees vocalist, drummer, violin, conductor.    
Costumes: $1000 - 4 pieces of costumes - material and partly tailoring.
Set Design: material and making charges: $500
Make up material: $437
Studio rent: $600 - rehearsals 
Promotional material: $500 - brochures, visiting cards, flyers, posters.


Costs to carry out the project: $4686


Travel Expenses: $1686 - flight tickets and taxi for the South East Asia tour
Accommodation: $700 
Fees: $2000 - adjusted fees for two dance artists/make up artist 
Unexpected expenses $300 



Every contribution is much appreciated and will be rewarded! All names of our contributors will be mentioned on our promotional materials! Depending of your contribution we will reward you with a special designed perk! For those who love our project but are not able to contribute we kindly request them to spread out the news to their friends, family and relatives who can support us! Please JUST SHOUT IT OUT! and use the Indiegogo share tools. At the end of the project our contributors will be the first to see an excerpt of our performances, we will share the video through youtube/vimeo.


Contribution of $10 will receive a special designed THANK YOU card by email. 
Contributions of $25  a set of 3 GraphicArtPostcards from shots taken during one of our performances printed on handmade paper and a SHOUT OUT on our Facebook page.
Contribution of $55 our featured perk, a special fashionable high quality organic cotton t-shirt that will be send to your doorsteps packed in handmade recyclable package. Your name will be mentioned on our FB page with a SHOUT OUT. The T-shirt is designed by us and manufactured by Shree Kailash Apparels in Tamil Nadu state, a company specialised in manufacturing for large charitable foundations.

<b>My Story: </b>
</h3><p style=""text-align: justify;"">I began dancing at a very young age. At the time, it was
extracurricular. As I dove further into my training, it became something so

movement. 

Now I’m a professional dance-artist, teacher and award-winning choreographer

Ballet School (London), The Paris Opera Ballet School (Paris), The School of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater (New York), San Francisco Ballet School (San Francisco), and 
the American Ballet Theatre (New York). 
I admire our art form greatly, primarily because of
the endless possibilities for continued growth and the knowledge we may acquire, then share. My passion is fueled by my desire to encourage and provoke

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Collin Sloan and I am a high school senior from Palm Coast, Florida who recently started his own theatre company, The Spotlight Performers. Last year, we successfully put on the rock musical, Spring Awakening and this year we are attempting to put on the Classic Rock jukebox musical, Rock of Ages to continue providing rock styled musicals to the local community. This campaign is important as without it, we would have no summer show this year. Our theatre company focuses on introducing immersive theatre to audiences around, breaking the typical idea of a traditional seated theatrical performance. Shown through last year's Spring Awakening, the entire show was put on around the audience with actors interacting and often entering/exiting through a center aisle created straight through the audience. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487558181/rbit5yy8aqetc0yq3jce.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Those You've Known (Cassidy Van Brink, Collin Sloan, Gerald Kitt)</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We plan to follow suit with this established tradition with Rock of Ages by performing in a warehouse with the inside transformed into the musical's hotspot location: The Bourbon Room, located on the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles, CA. Audience members will be sat at bar style tables or at the actual bar where actors will wait them while performing and even dancing on top of the tables, bar and anywhere they can head bang around. Our goal for this production is to make the audience feel as if they are in an LA bar during the rock and roll era that is the 1980's.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>For this entire production to get put together, we need a whopping $10,000 to cover everything and anything. This seems like a large amount, but it covers set costs, costume/prop costs, warehouse rental, rights rental, and lighting/sound equipment rental. All of this equates to about $10,000 and it's something we hope to achieve. To give back for donations, we implemented perks to give back for your donation! The more you donate, the more you get back with your donation. This production needs all the support it can get, so we want to make it worth your time and effort for helping us reach the end goal.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Show</h3>
<p>Rock of Ages is a rock/jukebox musical, with a book by Chris D'Arienzo, built around classic rock songs from the 1980s, especially from the famous glam metal bands of that decade. The musical features songs from Styx, Journey, Bon Jovi, Pat Benatar, Twisted Sister,Steve Perry, Poison and Europe among other well-known rock bands. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487557239/pifowgvgw3njupx3lhfh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>A Quick Synopsis, if you will:</p>
<p>It’s the tail end of the big, bad 1980s in Hollywood, and the party has been raging hard. Aqua Net, Lycra, lace and liquor flow freely at one of the Sunset Strips last legendary venues, a place where sex machine Stacee Jaxx takes the stage and scantily clad groupies line up to turn their fantasies into reality. Amidst the madness, aspiring rock star (and resident toilet cleaner) Drew longs to take the stage as the next big thing (and longs for small-town girl Sherri, fresh off the bus from Kansas with stars in her eyes). But the rock and roll fairy-tale is about to end when German developers sweep into town with plans to turn the fabled Strip into just another capitalist strip mall. Can Drew, Sherri, and the gang save the strip–and themselves–before it's too late? Only the music of hit bands Styx, Journey, Bon Jovi, Whitesnake and more hold the answer.</p>
<p>The show was nominated for five Tony Awards: Best Musical, Best Direction of a Musical, Best Costume Design, and Best Sound Design.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Producing a musical is financially difficult.  There are certain financial obstacles that reveal themselves, above and beyond that of conventional theatre, let alone immersive theatre. SPACE, SET MATERIALS, MUSICIANS, COSTUMES, PROPS, SCENIC ELEMENTS, and SOUND AND LIGHTING EQUIPMENT require a certain budget. We need your help in making this dream a reality for the incredible artists and audiences who might not always have an opportunity to create stimulating and challenging work or attend it.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>But Why?</h2>
<p>While it may not seem like it, doing these productions during the summer give students in the area along with adults and community members a chance to work together and create art in ways they wouldn't be able to on any other occasion. While doing this production, cast and crew members will learn and strengthen acting techniques, team building skills, dance coordination, and vocal technique. Members will also learn what it takes to make a production from start to finish through heavy involvement in every step of the process that the production must go through. When doing productions like these, everyone is given a chance to participate whether it be onstage, backstage, during the development process, and even when helping build the set from the ground up.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
My name is Collin Sloan and I am a high school senior from Palm Coast, Florida who recently started his own theatre company, The Spotlight Performers. Last year, we successfully put on the rock musical, Spring Awakening and this year we are attempting to put on the Classic Rock jukebox musical, Rock of Ages to continue providing rock styled musicals to the local community. This campaign is important as without it, we would have no summer show this year. Our theatre company focuses on introducing immersive theatre to audiences around, breaking the typical idea of a traditional seated theatrical performance. Shown through last year's Spring Awakening, the entire show was put on around the audience with actors interacting and often entering/exiting through a center aisle created straight through the audience. 
Spring Awakening (Gerald Kitt, Blair Duncan, Dylan Lev, Kianna Longhway, Collin Sloan, Cassidy Van Brink, John Zamborsky, Max Wolf, Anna Viscardi, Dylan Molitor, Katie Thompson)

Mama Who Bore Me reprise (Kianna Longhway, Blair Duncan, Cassidy Van Brink, Katie Thompson, Anna Viscardi)
​
Those You've Known (Cassidy Van Brink, Collin Sloan, Gerald Kitt)
 
We plan to follow suit with this established tradition with Rock of Ages by performing in a warehouse with the inside transformed into the musical's hotspot location: The Bourbon Room, located on the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles, CA. Audience members will be sat at bar style tables or at the actual bar where actors will wait them while performing and even dancing on top of the tables, bar and anywhere they can head bang around. Our goal for this production is to make the audience feel as if they are in an LA bar during the rock and roll era that is the 1980's.

What We Need & What You Get
For this entire production to get put together, we need a whopping $10,000 to cover everything and anything. This seems like a large amount, but it covers set costs, costume/prop costs, warehouse rental, rights rental, and lighting/sound equipment rental. All of this equates to about $10,000 and it's something we hope to achieve. To give back for donations, we implemented perks to give back for your donation! The more you donate, the more you get back with your donation. This production needs all the support it can get, so we want to make it worth your time and effort for helping us reach the end goal.

The Show
Rock of Ages is a rock/jukebox musical, with a book by Chris D'Arienzo, built around classic rock songs from the 1980s, especially from the famous glam metal bands of that decade. The musical features songs from Styx, Journey, Bon Jovi, Pat Benatar, Twisted Sister,Steve Perry, Poison and Europe among other well-known rock bands. 

A Quick Synopsis, if you will:
It’s the tail end of the big, bad 1980s in Hollywood, and the party has been raging hard. Aqua Net, Lycra, lace and liquor flow freely at one of the Sunset Strips last legendary venues, a place where sex machine Stacee Jaxx takes the stage and scantily clad groupies line up to turn their fantasies into reality. Amidst the madness, aspiring rock star (and resident toilet cleaner) Drew longs to take the stage as the next big thing (and longs for small-town girl Sherri, fresh off the bus from Kansas with stars in her eyes). But the rock and roll fairy-tale is about to end when German developers sweep into town with plans to turn the fabled Strip into just another capitalist strip mall. Can Drew, Sherri, and the gang save the strip–and themselves–before it's too late? Only the music of hit bands Styx, Journey, Bon Jovi, Whitesnake and more hold the answer.
The show was nominated for five Tony Awards: Best Musical, Best Direction of a Musical, Best Costume Design, and Best Sound Design.

Risks & Challenges
Producing a musical is financially difficult.  There are certain financial obstacles that reveal themselves, above and beyond that of conventional theatre, let alone immersive theatre. SPACE, SET MATERIALS, MUSICIANS, COSTUMES, PROPS, SCENIC ELEMENTS, and SOUND AND LIGHTING EQUIPMENT require a certain budget. We need your help in making this dream a reality for the incredible artists and audiences who might not always have an opportunity to create stimulating and challenging work or attend it.
 
But Why?
While it may not seem like it, doing these productions during the summer give students in the area along with adults and community members a chance to work together and create art in ways they wouldn't be able to on any other occasion. While doing this production, cast and crew members will learn and strengthen acting techniques, team building skills, dance coordination, and vocal technique. Members will also learn what it takes to make a production from start to finish through heavy involvement in every step of the process that the production must go through. When doing productions like these, everyone is given a chance to participate whether it be onstage, backstage, during the development process, and even when helping build the set from the ground up.

<h3>What Shall We Do With the Cello?</h3>
<p><i>Something is wrong, the rain just won't stop. In a waiting room: the man with the newspaper, the lady with the veil, the old man with the stick. In a corner, the man with the cello is ceaselessly playing his instrument. Very quickly, the repetitive and obsessing tune drives them mad. They try, taking turns, to convince him to stop, but the man with the cello won't. He is playing, more and more passionately, alone against everybody... The others will have to organize themselves against this unexpected musical aggression...</i></p>
<p>From 8-12 February, Atelier Theatre Studio will present the UK premiere of <strong>'What Shall We Do With the Cello?' at VAULT Festival 2017</strong>. This is a brilliant play for our times, written by a major European playwright, Matei Visniec, who sought asylum in France from Romania in 1987. Banned in Romania until after the fall of Ceausescu, this razorsharp and very funny play on intolerance and the terrible consequences of living without thinking was written from a place of deep experience.</p>

<p>Writer Matei Visniec</p>
<p><br/>This, the UK premiere, is directed by Vasile Nedelcu, whose first production of 'What Shall we do with the Cello?' in Romania in 1998 sparked writer Matei Visniec to say the performance made him realise how much he had written the play in response to the fear and violence of the time.</p>
<p>The live cello performance features the music of leading avant garde composer Iancu Dumitrescu: “It’s hard to imagine a more imaginative, creative, colourful, and for that matter, better composition than Dumitrescu’s Medium III”. Dean Suzuki, “Option”, Los Angeles</p>
<h3><strong>What Others Say About Our Work</strong></h3>
<p>From Vasile Nedelcu's 1998 production of the play:</p>
<p>""Full of spirit, with a special type of humour, thoughtful and buffoon at the same time, a production that makes us laugh, yet stirring in us, almost secretly, a wave of anxiety.”  Cristina Dumitrescu , Adevarul</p>
<p>”A wonderful production with powerful, inciting theatrical images that he has brought about through fantasy, humour, and, last but not least, through an original and coherent style.” Natalia Stancu, Curierul National</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The creative team are preparing for the show, the cast is on board and rehearsals start early January.  Cristina Catalina and Flora Smith are producing, and with the generous help of the Romanian Cultural Institute we have a chunk of the budget in place.  But in order to really get this off the ground - set, costume, lights, design, choreography, cast fees and travel, insurance and hopefully bringing Matei Visniec over to London, we need to raise £3,500. </p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, the producers will agree to work in kind - in fact, not only is Flora already committed to doing so, but she is also donating the first £500! (straight into the kitty, to save on indigogo fees...).  The cast and other creatives have agreed already very small fees as the baseline (we are run our productions on the principle of ""open book accounting for theatre"" and profit share), and the designer will be ever more usefully inventive within a lower budget. And the writer will have to Skype in one evening to see rehearsals ... But wifi is not great under the Waterloo tunnels, so we hope it won't come to that!</p>
<p>To thank you for your donations, we've got tasty Romanian treats on offer, postcards from the creative team thanking you, tunes emailed to you, perhaps from our cellist or perhaps sung by our very own lark, Simona Armstrong, finalist of Andrew Lloyd Webber's BBC series ""How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria?"", and playing THE LADY WITH THE VEIL in our show... and more! </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Remember when Nigel Farage said “he thought people would be concerned if a group of Romanians moved in next door”?  Well if we reach our £3,500 target the producers will personally send him a ticket to the first night and graciously invite him to dinner with the (largely Romanian!) cast and crew. </p>
<p>Aside from Mr Farage and his views, we hope to spark debate and connection in our audiences, widen the repertoire of European scripts on the British stage, and hopefully plant the seed for a tour. What we also really want though, is to give you a great, unforgettable night!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Even with your donations, we're still relying on box office sales going well, and we have to cover certain costs in advance of receiving any money. So it's a little scary until we reach the target....</p>
<p>Finances aside, our team of both cast and creatives are all experienced, passionate professionals, whose experiences range from planning and running a multi-disciplinary Fun Palace festival across several indoor and outdoor spaces at the Lyric Hammersmith; lecturing at Central St Martin's and designing for feature films, operas, and immersive events; acting in HBO dramas and on the stage of the Vienna English Theatre; and fostering projects and partnerships that promote life-long learning, expression and international collaboration. So the production your money will support is in good hands!</p>

<h3><strong>A bit about us...</strong></h3>
<p>Bread &amp; Goose make theatre for curious audiences. We aim to create visually-striking and narratively driven theatre with a social conscience. We are excited by untold stories and under-represented groups, and we seek to present new perspectives and challenging points of view to our audience, allowing space for response and dialogue. The team for this production are: Alison Neighbour, Kate Lovell, Jon Mcleod, Jo Shapland, Rhiannon White, Lucy Nicholls, and Nia Skyrme.</p>
<h3><strong>RETURN</strong></h3>
<p>RETURN is our latest project. We are working on a windswept beach in South Wales to create a new theatre production that explores the untold stories of military wives - their hopes, their dreams, their joys and their sorrows. We are exploring what it means to perpetually wait, and how ancient myth meets modern truth in the stories of Penelope in  Homer's Odyssey, and modern day military wives living in South Wales. The site and weather will be part of the production, and we're researching ways that we can work with, rather than against, the weather in this wild location where the geology and elements echo the story and emotions we are exploring.</p>
<p>The production is in the early stages of development, and the first stage of work was supported by National Theatre Wales' start up scheme ""Waleslab"". The video you can see up there is the documentation of what we made then. The next stage will involve the creative team revisiting the site for a further week of research and development in October. During that week here's what we'll be getting up to:</p>
<p>*Mapping audience journeys through the site. What will the production feel like for an audience? Where will we take them? What will happen? We can only figure this out by being onsite with the full creative team, allowing scenography, sound, narrative, and dance to interweave and respond to the weather and the landscape.</p>
<p>*Testing our sound sensors! We've got some amazing sensors that we plan to use to create sound activated by the weather, and we need to test them with the wind, sun and rain on the site.</p>
<p>*Meeting local military wives and running introductory workshops - welcoming new voices to the project and listening to their stories. If all goes well, they will have the opportunity to participate in the final production and receive professional training in performance and backstage roles.</p>
<p>*Sharing our work so far - on the last day we'll have a public sharing so everyone can see what we've made. We're working on a public beach, so being open about the work is really important to us, and we want to make close connections with the local community.</p>
<h3><strong>Why is this important?</strong></h3>
<p>This kind of research and development work is super important as it allows us to lay the groundwork for a fantastic and inclusive piece of theatre that's properly researched and provides an engaging experience for audiences and a valuable learning opportunity for professional artists and community participants.</p>
<p>Specifically, your contribution will go towards funding a Producer and  a Participation Officer for the project. These people will work with us to develop relationships with the local military and civilian communities, so we can offer workshops to women on military bases who don't have easy access to arts or other activity provision. They will support the creative team by sorting out licensing, permissions, publicity, and engagement, and they are the backbone of the entire project.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need </strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>As many of you will know, arts funding has been cut massively over the past few years, and competition is intense. Even with Arts Council funding, we still need to raise 25% of our total budget from other sources. OK, we thought, let's ask our friends and audiences if they can help. We need to raise £1000 to cover the cost of a Producer and a Participation Officer for 1 week each. This will help us reach our 25% target for the Arts Council, and give this project a real boost, allowing us to do the community outreach work that's at the heart of this project and the story we want to tell. At the end of our R&amp;D week, we'll be in a really good place to apply for production funds from some of the big trusts and foundations - we just need a little kickstart with the fundraising from our supporters.</p>
<p>Whatever you can give, be it £1 or £100, we'll be incredibly grateful, and your contribution will really count towards the production. </p>
<p>Just so you know, we're applying to Arts Council Wales to cover the main expenditure on the project - a £4000 grant from ACW will cover our creative team fees (director, designer, writer, choreographer and composer); fees for 3 performers to join us for 2 days; a production manager to oversee the practical stuff and keep us safe; a license to work on the site; and our transport to and from the site. We're also really pleased that National Theatre Wales have given us the money for our sound sensors, and we're very grateful to our wonderful mentors in the industry and Vale of Glamorgan council for giving up their time for free in support of this project.</p>
<p>We believe everyone should get paid fairly, and whilst wages in the arts will never be high, we always pay at least ITC minimum. Everyone working on this project will receive £500 for the equivalent of a weeks work.</p>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><div>
<p>We completely understand that not everyone can help financially - many of you will be fundraising for your own projects, or might prefer to give to charity, or you just simply can't afford to be giving cash to everyone who asks. If that's you, then we'd be super grateful if you could share this campaign with anyone you think might be interested in either supporting us, or finding out about the project. We'd also be really happy if you would like to join our mailing list if you haven't already, and come and see the show when it's ready. If you're local to Dunraven, please come and say hello when we're on the beach - we'd love to see you! And if you live on the Beachley or St Athan Barracks, we'd especially love to hear from you.</p>
<p>We'll be posting updates here and on our website once our fundraising is done and we have our dates finalised.</p>
<h3><strong>What do you get in exchange?</strong></h3>
<p>We thought it kinda defeats the object of fundraising if we spend all the money on sending out gifts, and we're sure you'd rather we spent it on the actual thing we're fundraising for, so we've decided the best way to say thank you is to include you in the process of making the show - after all, you've helped pay for it! So for everyone who contributes (unless you'd rather opt out), we'll send you updates and little video snippets of our work throughout the process of research and development, and invite you to comment and share your thoughts. We really value audience feedback, so don't be shy about telling us what you really think! We'll also be offering discounted tickets for the finished production to all of our supporters once we're at that stage, and we'll be pleased to invite you along to special aftershow events too.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for reading this far. Please share our campaign with your networks, it would mean a lot to us.</p>

We really value audience feedback, so don't be shy about telling us what you really think! We'll also be offering discounted tickets for the finished production to all of our supporters once we're at that stage, and we'll be pleased to invite you along to special aftershow events too.
Thank you so much for reading this far. Please share our campaign with your networks, it would mean a lot to us.

<h3>What Is This All About?</h3>
<p>I'm Malinda Logan - actress, director, producer, philanthropist and humanitarian. Ever since high school when I first read <i>My Sister, My Sister</i>, I felt so connected to the main character Sue Belle's plight and her strength to conquer her demons. As I grew older, I noticed every family has demons that they turn into skeletons - no matter what social, cultural or economic class you were lucky enough to be born into.</p>
<p><i>My Sister, My Sister</i> delves into the life and mind of an African-American girl growing up in a lower working class and extremely volatile household in the 1950s. She must cope with an over-religious but loving mother, an alcoholic but well-meaning father, and a promiscuous but overlooked older sister.</p>
<p>Dealing with complex issues of mental illness, religious conviction, and racial identity, <i>My Sister My Sister</i> reminds us that African-Americans developed coping mechanisms in a world that was not designed for them to flourish. Directly tied with situations that are prevalent in the black community today, reviving this award-winning production will stimulate the parallel between decades of stagnant cultural norms and social deficits across all human families.</p>
<p>Contribute to a story that needs to be told.</p>
</div><div>
<div><h3>Why <i>My Sister</i>, Why Now?</h3></div>
<p>I am an African-American woman who grew up with a small family in New Orleans Louisiana, playing next to statues of Jim Crow, allowing Caucasian boys and girls to feel my skin because they “just don’t know,” and being chastised and ignored within black and white communities because of the darkness of my skin tone.</p>
<p>I have cried myself to sleep at night because I've needed to comfort friends, foes and those I barely knew over matters of abuse, mental anguish, rape, economic injustice and hardship. I've learned that these struggles have no boundaries and neither does our love and support.  I am now a NYC-based artist, actor, fundraiser, philanthropist, multi-degree and ivy-league graduate. My proudest moment was when I became a humanitarian.</p>
<p>Since the onset of the Black Lives Matter movement, the fighting against and within the black community at large grew stronger. I believe it’s been allowed to fester because people don’t understand their history and can’t empathize with struggles being passed down from generations. Even though this play was written in the 1970s and is set in the 1950s, it's still very relevant to today.</p>
<p>This play will give audiences a look into how people are reacting - to many wounds that were never healed – in and out of the black community.</p>
<h3>What Do You Need &amp; What Will I Get?</h3>
<p>It takes a lot to revive an award-winning production- to do it justice- on the part of the playwright, the actors, and the creative team and crew. We need to design sets, rent costumes, secure licenses, pay for insurance, rent the theater, and so much more! From the director to the assistants - everyone will provide an enormous amount of talent and work, and they need to get paid for their valuable expertise. The more funds we can raise, the more money will be reinvested into a quality show! The expense breakdown is pictured below. </p>

<h3>About Richard III in Japan</h3>
<p>Richard III is one of Shakespeare’s most recognizable “anti-heroes,” scheming and manipulating his way into power at the expense of enemies and loved ones alike. This production is set against the backdrop of Japan’s Genpei War, circa 1185, and focuses exclusively on Richard’s story arc. The production features a dual chorus conceit: one vocal chorus performs Shakespeare’s words into microphones, while a second physical chorus is devoted to bunraku puppetry. All actors involved will also create live foley.</p>
<p>At Lean and Hungry Theater, we believe that narratives like <i>Richard III</i> transcend time and place. Our job, as storytellers, is to present that narrative in ways that speak to our wide-ranging and diverse audience.</p>
<p>The team:</p>
<p>Adapter/Director: Kevin Finkelstein<br/>Assistant Director/Dramaturg: Jessica Clark<br/>Puppetry Consultant: Martin Holman<br/>Lighting Designer: Katie McCreary<br/><br/>Vocal Chorus: Jon Jon Johnson, KyoSin Kang, Momo Nakamura, Andrew Quilpa, Elizabeth Ung, Mary Yee</p>
<p>Physical Chorus: Claire Derriennic, David Johnson, Micaela Mannix, Peter Mikhail, Eirin Stevenson</p>

<h3>Where Your Money Goes</h3>
<p><i>Richard III</i> is Lean and Hungry's most ambitious performance to date. Your generous donation will allow us to achieve the following:</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This is the debut work of The Cartographers. It is a lean, whirlwind of a story, likely unlike most things you've ever seen in a theatre before. The tragic, heartening, poetic, and wonder-filled world of Raymondo is shared by one actor and many cassette tapes in a short but powerful hour of performance. It is fast and fun and will hopefully leave you feeling nostalgic and cozy inside for days after the show.</p>
<p>We chose this play because of Annie Siddons' extraordinary words and also for the opportunity it offers to share work in a nontraditional way. Rather than touring theaters around the country, we plan to bring this to smaller community-centric venues where art is less often encountered. Currently we're targeting Chicago, Boston, New York, and Houston, but Denver, Milwaukee, and several other cities are in our sites as well. Our window of performance is January - April 2019.</p>
<p>The Cartographers is the brainchild of Hal Cosentino and Jeremy Ohringer. Hal is an actor and playwright who has developed work at The New Colony and The Neo-Futurists in Chicago and at New Georges and Mom’s Insurance in NYC. Jeremy Ohringer is a director and playwright currently finishing his MFA at Boston University. His recent work includes Melancholy Play (a chamber musical), Mother Courage and Her Children, and adaptations of Three Sisters, The Iliad, The Odyssey, and Lord of The Flies.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're approaching this process economically and as we have no existing donor base to turn to, we want to make this happen (relatively) inexpensively. To travel and tell this story, we're seeking funds for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Production costs (sound materials, costumes, production expendables, properties, etc)</li>
<li>Artist pay (our playwright, our actor, our composer, our photographer, our director, etc)</li>
<li>Travel costs (flights, transport in cities, accommodations, food and drink, etc)</li>
<li>Administrative expenses (marketing costs, platform fees, PR materials, grant fees, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>We're asking for your help in making this happen, and want you to feel like you're joining us on the adventure. Contributors will not only receive fabulous perks like cassette tape art, custom postcards from the road, and even their own ""Cape of OK!"", but they'll also become part of the journey. We'll keep backers updated at every step along the way: when we're starting rehearsals, when we're coming to a new city, and when we begin sharing this beautiful story.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We believe this production will not only be a way to bring people to intimate spaces and build community, but this will also be an opportunity to introduce audiences to new types of stories and people and ways of making theatre. We hope to meet audiences where they live and use theatre as it's best meant to be used--as a tool that inspires empathy, that reminds us to always consider the depths and personhood of those around us, and that leaves you with new thoughts about the world that make you giggle and ponder for weeks and months and years.</p>
<p>For us, the mission to bring work to radically diverse audiences across the country is vital for our personal success but also for the furthering of the cause of modern American theatre. This is a wonderful story to advance that effort, and we hope it is something you can be part of.</p>

<h3>A Little Bit of Where?</h3>
<p>We are a new theatre company built by two emerging theatre practitioners who are very dedicated to the art of musical theatre and bringing people joy with it. We are bringing our first musical, called <i>A Little Bit of Life </i>(or ALBOL for short) to stages of London. We have performed this musical once during our university years and back then it was a huge success. We believe that this story is still relevant now and we want to do the best we can to bring it to our audience. </p>

<p>My name is Anthony Robustelli and I’m a musician, composer, producer, author, and historian based in Brooklyn, NY. Over the years I’ve produced numerous projects, toured the world, and collaborated with countless musicians on music that not only entertains, but is socially conscious. Even so, no project has been as important to me as my musical, The So-Called President.</p>
<p>The So-Called President examines the catalyst for the current tone of the country – the occupant of the White House – and tells a timeless story; one of people standing up for the rights they deserve, have come to expect and now realize are not guaranteed. My goal and sincere belief is that The So-Called President can do for modern day American politics what Hamilton did for the birth of the nation – crystallize this moment in time and empower citizens to make their voices heard.</p>
<p>I have started this campaign to raise the funds needed to stage The So-Called President on election night 2018 and for one week thereafter. With your support I will be able to do a week of performances to gain interest of outside producers to stage the musical for an extended run. There are a number of tiers available for contributors, so please give your support to make this show possible.</p>
<p>If we meet our goal, the show will open on election night and run for a week. If we do not meet our financial goal, depending on the amount raised, we will launch the show for election night and work toward a longer run at some point in the future.</p>

<p>And after 10 years in the Fiesta District we are pleased to have the opportunity to relocate to the heart of Downtown Mesa at 214 W Main St!</p>
<p>It is an opportunity for NCT to bring the spontaneous and interactive improv that our audiences love to the vibrant and arts and entertainment district of Main St!</p>
<p>We are thrilled to be on the verge of creating a community that will bring even more laughter and creative opportunities to the people of Mesa!</p>

</div></div>","NCT is Moving To Main St: Short Summary
Hello there! We are the cast and crew of National Comedy Theatre Phoenix (NCT).
And after 10 years in the Fiesta District we are pleased to have the opportunity to relocate to the heart of Downtown Mesa at 214 W Main St!
It is an opportunity for NCT to bring the spontaneous and interactive improv that our audiences love to the vibrant and arts and entertainment district of Main St!
We are thrilled to be on the verge of creating a community that will bring even more laughter and creative opportunities to the people of Mesa!
Here’s What We Need Help With
Now, we plan on re-purposing much of our existing theater equipment and structures for our new downtown home.
However, we are in dire need of some theater upgrades to ensure the audience has a great experience for every performance.  
Number one: our new theater will need new chairs for brand new butts! Yessir, it is absolutely vital to keep Arizona’s heinies happy. And those yellow squeaky chairs from our old theater will no longer be with us (please see “old chair bonfire perk”... I’m kidding. That’s not a perk. But that would be cool...)
Number two: we need to upgrade the current electrical situation at the new place, which was most definitely not created with a theater space in mind!  ...While we as performers would get all giddy at the idea of performing with lanterns in hand, the audience however, would be very underwhelmed.
Number three, our final need: Our new space is like one long hall... which makes it pretty weird when the cast needs to change or do the businessy type paper work...
So, we need to build a dividing wall between theater stage and seating area, aka ""Where the Magic Happens"" and the ""Green Room"" and ""Office"" where all the ""Non-Magical and Kinda Weird Real World Stuff Happens""

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Founded in 2018, the Passage Theatre (TPT) is an emerging not-for-profit theatre company based in Chicago. With three successful seasons complete, we are launching our Winter (aka See You On the Other Side) Fundraiser in preparation for programming exciting new shows in 2021.</p>
<p>There are a lot of expenses that go into live performance (venue rental, design elements, insurance, administrative overhead, etc.), but at TPT our number one priority is our collaborators. This is reflected not only in how we treat the artists who work with us, but also in our budget--by far the largest line item in our budget for the past two years has been artist stipends. <strong>By contributing, you will help us support Chicago theatre artists, create a more equitable and accessible artistic community, and keep producing astonishing live performances. </strong>TPT is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization, and all donations are tax-deductible.</p>
<p>Read on for more information about TPT, our history of producing original theatrical works, how we have used 2020 to improve our company, and where your money goes.</p>
<p>Plus, check out the perks for various levels of donation! You can earn a custom haiku, meme, or piece of embroidery, and even unlock a virtual hangout with our new Co-Artistic Directors!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>Our mission, newly revised and expanded, is as follows:</p>
<p>With our artists, our audiences, and the stories we tell, The Passage Theatre seeks to create art that looks into the void with hope instead of dread.<br/><br/><strong>We tell stories with truth and simplicity.</strong><br/>We create thought-provoking, minimalistic, ensemble-based theatre that is specific to its medium. Our work is driven by curiosity and the conviction that whimsy and humor are powerful ways to explore the universe.<br/> <br/><strong>We focus on humanity. </strong><br/>We are a community-oriented company with faith in collaboration and transparency. We prioritize paying artists over buying things and believe human ingenuity is more essential than production budget in creating the spectacular. <br/><br/><strong>We believe in hope and innovation.</strong><br/>We value creativity over tradition, both artistically and institutionally. We continuously endeavor to establish and invent more equitable practices at all levels of our organization. Through these practices, we hope to advance our industry’s greater movement toward a more accessible Chicago theatre.</p>

Track Record
To date we have produced three live productions and one virtual staged reading.In November of 2018, TPT made its debut with the ""gorgeous, melancholy saga"" Spirits to Enforce by Mickle Maher (Chicago Reader). Directed by company member Will Quam, the show was a ""tight, excellent production with a lot of HEART and bursting with talent from all ends"" (PerformInk). ""Skillfully crafted and beautifully acted ... the perfect inaugural production,"" Spirits to Enforce was included in Picture This Post's round up of Best Plays in Chicago.Our second production, The Lessons, was an immersive collection of devised monologues written by the ensemble. Chicago Theatre Triathlon  called it a ""feat of fiery talent"" with ""wildly imaginative direction"" by Abigail Phelps.

THE IMPACT
Accountability - Students are taught that they are a part of a team. They are expected to practice their skills both in rehearsal and at home, as not doing so impacts the group overall.
Time Management - Students are treated as professionals and are taught to be respectful and mindful of time. 
Physical Strength and Health - Dance and performance movement encourages students to lead a healthier, more active lifestyle.
Mental Focus - Students learn the power of focused and positive thinking, which is something they can apply to all other aspects of their lives.
Education - Teaching not only the physical technique behind performing, but the history, vocabulary and the impact that performing has had in society.
 
RISKS & CHALLENGES

The biggest challenge we will face will be Covid-19. Traditionally learning is done in person but with the virus many aspects of the performing will be forced to adjust. This means we may be forced to develop new practices, techniques and develop entirely new ways of educating our students. 
Historically there have been many arguments that the performing arts are not an essential or necessary program for youth. Even though we know the value of the performing arts, that may present difficulty in receiving funding.

But she also offers us a deeper glimpse into the darker side of Shakespeare’s work: the isolation, grief, and mental fracturing of an artist who suffered such extreme personal trauma in parallel with his meteoric success.</p><p>Choreography, dance and aerial became the perfect mediums to explore with the body what could not be expressed verbally, and they opened avenues to challenge our understandings of masculine or feminine movement and of how a ‘healthy’ or ‘anxious’ mind behaves. After recrafting a new script and storyboard, I formed a team of fellow Glasgow-based artists - Adam Wright (Choreographer, Performer). Rufus Huggan (Cellist), Zak Hassan (Violinist) – to bring the work to life.

We are developing two new works for which the creative process began on the 1st July 2019. We have been working 8 hours a day, 6 days a week totalling 288 studio rehearsal hours. This does not include the many hours that go towards production, mentoring, performances, workshops and tour planning.</p><p> </p><p><u><strong>How and why it all started…</strong></u></p><p>We started ilYoung 7 years ago, creating successful projects every year and offering professional experience to young and emerging artists. We aim to assist these artists in the demanding transition between student and professional by equipping them with the mental, physical and creative tools necessary to dive into their professional careers. </p><p>Every year since 2013, ilYoung has brought together ten young artists from Sweden and abroad to create a new production in a professional environment. This process takes place in residencies across Sweden and the company then tour the new creation nationwide. Throughout the entire process the artists are mentored and supported by professionals who are particularly experienced in working with emerging and young artists. </p><p> </p><p><u><strong>SUCCESS!</strong></u></p><p>The majority of the involved ilYoung artists have secured professional jobs working with companies such as GöteborgsOperans Danskompani, Royal Swedish Ballet, The Swedish Royal Dramatic theatre (Dramaten), Regionteater Väst and ilDance in Sweden and with companies abroad such as Nationaltheater Mannheim (Germany) Theater Osnabrück (Germany) Black Box Dance company (Denmark) Gwyn Emberton Dance (Wales) Chrysalis London (UK) and CATAPULT Dance (Australia). Additionally, many of these young artists have joined and/or initiated independent projects.</p><p> </p><p><u><strong>Why we need your help to reach our goal of 100,000 SEK</strong></u></p><p>Despite this growing legacy and growing success and as an entirely independent company, ilYoung doesn’t receive regular financial support from any institution or official funding body in Sweden to run this project. As a result, the directors of ilDance, Israel Aloni and Lee Brummer are required to start again from square one, every year.</p><p>The project is both invaluable for the contemporary dance field and provides immediate and clear development to young artists. We are extremely passionate to continue creating these opportunities for future generations of dance artists. This is where we need your help.</p><p>The money we acquire from this campaign will go towards paying the salaries of the creative team and covering costs of travel and accommodation for the company to tour nationally.  </p><p>We have managed to secure 350 000 SEK, constituting the resources to cover 78% of the total of this year’s costs. We need your help to cover the remaining 22% of our costs which total 100 000 SEK.

We aim to assist these artists in the demanding transition between student and professional by equipping them with the mental, physical and creative tools necessary to dive into their professional careers. Every year since 2013, ilYoung has brought together ten young artists from Sweden and abroad to create a new production in a professional environment. This process takes place in residencies across Sweden and the company then tour the new creation nationwide. Throughout the entire process the artists are mentored and supported by professionals who are particularly experienced in working with emerging and young artists.  SUCCESS!The majority of the involved ilYoung artists have secured professional jobs working with companies such as GöteborgsOperans Danskompani, Royal Swedish Ballet, The Swedish Royal Dramatic theatre (Dramaten), Regionteater Väst and ilDance in Sweden and with companies abroad such as Nationaltheater Mannheim (Germany) Theater Osnabrück (Germany) Black Box Dance company (Denmark) Gwyn Emberton Dance (Wales) Chrysalis London (UK) and CATAPULT Dance (Australia). Additionally, many of these young artists have joined and/or initiated independent projects. Why we need your help to reach our goal of 100,000 SEKDespite this growing legacy and growing success and as an entirely independent company, ilYoung doesn’t receive regular financial support from any institution or official funding body in Sweden to run this project. As a result, the directors of ilDance, Israel Aloni and Lee Brummer are required to start again from square one, every year.The project is both invaluable for the contemporary dance field and provides immediate and clear development to young artists. We are extremely passionate to continue creating these opportunities for future generations of dance artists. This is where we need your help.The money we acquire from this campaign will go towards paying the salaries of the creative team and covering costs of travel and accommodation for the company to tour nationally.  We have managed to secure 350 000 SEK, constituting the resources to cover 78% of the total of this year’s costs. We need your help to cover the remaining 22% of our costs which total 100 000 SEK.

<h3>Help Us Make Trans Theatre in Atlanta</h3>
<p>Written by Sloka Krishnan and directed by Thandi DeShazor, <i>The Grand Transsexual Draweth Nigh</i> is a magical trans Halloween mystery play; a plea for ritual and transcendence; and an exploration of identity, authenticity, assimilation, and the ways in which we are consumed and alienated by our own desires. It follows a young gay trans man of color and three of his friends on the night when they once and for all become the devourers, not the devoured.</p>
<p>Performances will take place on April 25-26 and May 2-3, 2020, at <a href=""https://thebakeryatlanta.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Bakery</a>, with a developmental staged reading (free and open to the public!) at <a href=""http://outfronttheatre.com/event/spectrum-spotlight-the-grand-transexual-draweth-nigh/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Out Front Theatre</a> on March 25. We are excited to be producing this play supported in part by a grant from the City of Atlanta Mayor's Office of Cultural Affairs, but the grant will only cover about half our costs. <strong>That's where you come in!</strong></p>

<h3>Hard Core Logo: Live</h3>
<p>BFL Theatre is excited to present the Toronto and Eastern Canadian premiere of <strong>Hard Core Logo: Live — A Punk-Ass Play</strong>. This is a stage version of the cult Canadian film <i>Hard Core Logo</i> (directed by Bruce McDonald, with screenplay by Noel S. Baker from the novel written by Michael Turner). Adapted by Michael Scholar Jr., with brand new music by legendary Vancouver punk star Joe ""Shithead"" Keithley (D.O.A), the show will take place <strong>March 9-26</strong> at <strong>Lee's Palace</strong>, upstairs in the Dance Cave.</p>
<p>This will not be a “seated-quietly-in-the-dark” affair, by any stretch of the imagination. No way, man! It's a theatre narrative and a punk concert, rolled into one fat joint. You will experience the full theatrical telling of the HCL story — the highs, the lows, and the laughs — while you and your crew let loose to the live punk music.</p>
<p>The manic drumbeats will make your heart palpitate, <br/>    the screeching guitars will make your body gyrate, <br/>        the booming bass will make your lungs vibrate <br/>            and the vocals will have you roaring like a primate…..<br/>                            and wait…..<br/>The booze at the bar will help your liver hydrate.<br/>Gonna be a helluva party, mate!<br/><br/>And… what better venue for this musical mayhem and searing storytelling than the historical and iconic <strong>Lee’s Palace</strong>? If the walls could only talk of the the legendary musical acts that have been there before! Come scream, sweat, laugh, cry, dance and drink… it's a celebration of Punk Music, Canadian Legend, and Indie Theatre.</p>

<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<p>Wildcard creates theatre to shine a light on the absurdity of the world we live in, as well as nurturing those who are passionate about pursuing a career in the arts. Established in 2015, Wildcard has enjoyed many success so far, having produced three fringe productions in 2016 to critical acclaim. Most recently Wildcard has become a charity (no. 1170677), it consists of 10 members and is governed by 4 trustees.</p>
<p>If you would like to know more about us please go to our website <a href=""http://www.wildcardtheatre.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.wildcardtheatre.co.uk</a> or drop us an email at info@wildcardtheatre.co.uk and we'd be happy to answer any questions you may have. Alternatively, just say hello and we can have a nice chat!</p>
<h3><strong>Why This Play?</strong></h3>
<p>After Party tells an important story about the need for human connection and how tragedy can shatter the ability to find it. This is so apparent in our divided world today, where the need to connect with each other is being over shadowed by the hatred that divides us. In this microcosm After Party challenges how we are operating as a society and poses the question, is it possible to accept the past and stand side by side in the present?</p>
<p>Put simply, it asks, is it possible to love instead of hate?</p>
<h3>How Will Your Donation Help?</h3>
<p>Wildcard receives no core funding and is run by a small, dedicated team of volunteers. In order to put After Party on we need to raise £8,000. This is to cover production costs including insurance, set, costume, lighting, props, rehearsal space and marketing campaign to get bums on seats! Also, Wildcard has recently signed the Equity Fringe Agreement - Professionally Made, Professionally Paid - as we are dedicated to paying our actors and creatives the industry standard wage. This has been a huge step for Wildcard and it's a cause we strongly believe in and it's your donations that will help stop unethical employment in this industry. </p>
<p>We're currently applying for multiple grants and awards as well as organising fundraising events to help reach our total budget, but we will be short without the kind support of the general public. We are eternally grateful for any donation, however big or small, you may be able to give. </p>
<p>In return we can offer you a selection of Wildcard goodies as well as mentions on our social media platforms and website.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or would like to know how your money is being spent, please don't hesitate to email us at info@wildcardtheatre.co.uk and we'll keep you updated on exactly where it is going and what it is helping us to achieve. Alternatively, if you are interested in becoming a long term supporter of Wildcard please email joseph@wildcardtheatre.co.uk. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that sometimes it is not always possible to offer financial support! </p>

<h3>About <i>Empty Rooms</i>
</h3>
<p>Jennifer, a brilliant coder, is preparing for a conference that could make or break her tech company. But between Sara, the mom re-entering the workforce; Natalie, the whip-smart but underutilized (and unpaid) intern; Frank, the coder-turned-admin in over his head; Margot, the PR specialist called in to reverse an inevitable crisis; and one-sided convos with Ada Lovelace, the world's first (and long-dead) computer programmer, Jennifer has her work cut out for her.  Can Jennifer’s revolutionary new program save the company, or will savage rivalries and personal egos destroy everything?</p>
<p><i>Empty Rooms</i> is an irreverent comedy that will be touring across Atlanta, taking over the common rooms of tech offices, coding schools and universities. Each performance will be a truly unique experience for audiences, as we'll be transforming each of our Host Venues into a theatrical set. We'll be utilizing their existing furniture, lighting, sound systems, projection equipment and room configurations, and each venue will host a max of three performances. As far as we know, nothing quite like this tour has ever been done before!</p>
<p>For this production, we've sought feedback from professionals currently working in the tech sector to make sure our story accurately portrays the opportunities and challenges of working in tech. The script has received developmental work and feedback at playwriting centers across the country, and named a semi-finalist of one of the top playwriting awards in the country: The Eugene O’Neill Playwrights Conference.</p>

<h3>About Found Stages</h3>
<p>Since 2014, Found Stages has been taking an innovative approach to plays: We don't do them in theaters. Instead, we partner with businesses, community organizations and nature centers to present our stories in the actual settings in which they take place. <i>Empty Rooms</i> will be our third fully produced project, and our largest to date. We're finding our niche, and want to be here to stay. You could say, that with this production, we're claiming a room in our Atlanta home.</p>
<p>Found Stages believes that theater is the best way to build empathy among (not-so-) different groups of people. We present our plays in site-specific locations because we believe that's the best way for our stories to reach the people that most need to see them. <i>Empty Rooms</i> has the potential to spark positive and productive conversations about how we build our future and tell its stories. Laughter is the best medicine, remember?</p>
<p>Since our first production - at Dunwoody Nature Center in 2014 - Found Stages has built a track record of presenting high-quality, innovative, original plays that affect audience members in personal ways that just couldn't happen in a traditional theater venue. We think theater should give people a reason to get out of the house and go join their community. We make shows that we would want to attend as audience members.</p>
<p>Visit our website for more info: <a href=""http://foundstages.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.foundstages.org</a></p>
</div>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Contribute?</h3>
<p>All performances of this show are being presented for FREE to ensure that anyone who wants to attend can do so. Ticket sales normally cover 50% of a production's budget. We can't change the world in an empty room, so here's where we need your help: If you think this story is worth telling and want to see immersive and site-specific theater continue in the Atlanta area, please contribute.</p>
<p>As the digital world becomes more and more intertwined with our physical world, women and men of all colors and walks of life need to collaborate - sharing opinions, experiences, talent and ideas - to make the new infrastructure of our world the best it can be. Tech and the arts share a gender gap - more tech inventions and more plays by men are being marketed than those by women.</p>
<p>Your contribution will prove that women can be funny, successful, intelligent, beautiful, likeable, ambitious, talented, leaders, writers, directors, producers, coders, visionary geniuses, wives, mothers, sisters, friends, advocates, collaborators, and [fill in the blank]. And it will give inclusivity the kick-in-the-butt it needs!</p>

</div></div>","About Empty Rooms

Jennifer, a brilliant coder, is preparing for a conference that could make or break her tech company. But between Sara, the mom re-entering the workforce; Natalie, the whip-smart but underutilized (and unpaid) intern; Frank, the coder-turned-admin in over his head; Margot, the PR specialist called in to reverse an inevitable crisis; and one-sided convos with Ada Lovelace, the world's first (and long-dead) computer programmer, Jennifer has her work cut out for her.  Can Jennifer’s revolutionary new program save the company, or will savage rivalries and personal egos destroy everything?
Empty Rooms is an irreverent comedy that will be touring across Atlanta, taking over the common rooms of tech offices, coding schools and universities. Each performance will be a truly unique experience for audiences, as we'll be transforming each of our Host Venues into a theatrical set. We'll be utilizing their existing furniture, lighting, sound systems, projection equipment and room configurations, and each venue will host a max of three performances. As far as we know, nothing quite like this tour has ever been done before!
For this production, we've sought feedback from professionals currently working in the tech sector to make sure our story accurately portrays the opportunities and challenges of working in tech. The script has received developmental work and feedback at playwriting centers across the country, and named a semi-finalist of one of the top playwriting awards in the country: The Eugene O’Neill Playwrights Conference.

About Found Stages
Since 2014, Found Stages has been taking an innovative approach to plays: We don't do them in theaters. Instead, we partner with businesses, community organizations and nature centers to present our stories in the actual settings in which they take place. Empty Rooms will be our third fully produced project, and our largest to date. We're finding our niche, and want to be here to stay. You could say, that with this production, we're claiming a room in our Atlanta home.
Found Stages believes that theater is the best way to build empathy among (not-so-) different groups of people. We present our plays in site-specific locations because we believe that's the best way for our stories to reach the people that most need to see them. Empty Rooms has the potential to spark positive and productive conversations about how we build our future and tell its stories. Laughter is the best medicine, remember?
Since our first production - at Dunwoody Nature Center in 2014 - Found Stages has built a track record of presenting high-quality, innovative, original plays that affect audience members in personal ways that just couldn't happen in a traditional theater venue. We think theater should give people a reason to get out of the house and go join their community. We make shows that we would want to attend as audience members.
Visit our website for more info: www.foundstages.org


Why Contribute?
All performances of this show are being presented for FREE to ensure that anyone who wants to attend can do so. Ticket sales normally cover 50% of a production's budget. We can't change the world in an empty room, so here's where we need your help: If you think this story is worth telling and want to see immersive and site-specific theater continue in the Atlanta area, please contribute.
As the digital world becomes more and more intertwined with our physical world, women and men of all colors and walks of life need to collaborate - sharing opinions, experiences, talent and ideas - to make the new infrastructure of our world the best it can be. Tech and the arts share a gender gap - more tech inventions and more plays by men are being marketed than those by women.
Your contribution will prove that women can be funny, successful, intelligent, beautiful, likeable, ambitious, talented, leaders, writers, directors, producers, coders, visionary geniuses, wives, mothers, sisters, friends, advocates, collaborators, and [fill in the blank]. And it will give inclusivity the kick-in-the-butt it needs!

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>From the mind of the writer to opening night, putting on a play is an exhilarating undertaking. You will be helping an up and coming playwright/actor make his vision come alive. This piece I've written comes from a somewhat dark and painful place for me and I have wanted to get it out there into the ether for some time now. I can't do it without your help!</p>
<p>My track record with theatre has been fortunate in my short tenure. Last year 'The Commedia Cinderella', a play in which I had a lead role (Pantalone) won Best Off-Broadway Family Show at The Off-Broadway Alliance Awards. Last April I originated the role of The Caterpillar in Billie Aken Tyers' 'Your Alice' with Ophelia Theatre Group. The show is now in talks for a run at a big Off-Broadway theatre house. I have been mentioned/reviewed in The New York Times, New York Theatre Review, On Stage Blog, and several others journals for my acting. </p>
<p>I am constantly looking to continue my growth as an artist, but additionally for this festival I am hoping to showcase the talents of my contemporaries who I hold in high regard.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Though I have primarily been an actor (appearing in 20+ shows over the past 3 years), this is my first full length play and directorial debut. I am excited, grateful, nervous and all of the above for this experience, but that being said, I am confident in my abilities and in the surrounding circumstances due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>A full production team of seasoned theatrical veterans at the helm.</li>
<li>My unwavering love for acting, theatre, and original story telling.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute with a donation, don't worry!</p>
<ul>
<li>Spreading the word about the show will go a long way! Winterfest is a competition with awards for best actor/actress, play and director, so the more buzz, the better!</li>
<li>You can always use the Indiegogo share tools to share with friends!</li>

Last year 'The Commedia Cinderella', a play in which I had a lead role (Pantalone) won Best Off-Broadway Family Show at The Off-Broadway Alliance Awards. Last April I originated the role of The Caterpillar in Billie Aken Tyers' 'Your Alice' with Ophelia Theatre Group. The show is now in talks for a run at a big Off-Broadway theatre house. I have been mentioned/reviewed in The New York Times, New York Theatre Review, On Stage Blog, and several others journals for my acting. 
I am constantly looking to continue my growth as an artist, but additionally for this festival I am hoping to showcase the talents of my contemporaries who I hold in high regard.

Risks & Challenges
Though I have primarily been an actor (appearing in 20+ shows over the past 3 years), this is my first full length play and directorial debut. I am excited, grateful, nervous and all of the above for this experience, but that being said, I am confident in my abilities and in the surrounding circumstances due to:

A full production team of seasoned theatrical veterans at the helm.
My unwavering love for acting, theatre, and original story telling.


Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute with a donation, don't worry!

Spreading the word about the show will go a long way! Winterfest is a competition with awards for best actor/actress, play and director, so the more buzz, the better!
You can always use the Indiegogo share tools to share with friends!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey! Khalil here...Glad to have your attention and thrilled to share a few details about the development of my new play ILLINOIS BOY BLUES. It is another one-man show filled with dynamic characters, stories of Illinois that you've never heard and make no mistake about it, ""it's the blues baby!!! I can not wait to share it with you all...If you're not familiar with my work, I'm the creator and performer of the award winning one-man show PRYOR TRUTH*, the first ever one-man show to celebrate the life and legacy of comedian ""Richard Pryor"". I call it an actor's tribute. The folks over at TimeOutNY viewed it as ""<i>a love letter to the legendary comedian Richard Pryor...hilarious &amp; deeply personal, an inspiring reminder of the need to fight for honesty within ourselves</i>."" In any case, that play changed my life! Imagine feeling as though you are performing exclusively for your IDOL, but in actuality you are performing in front of a room full of people, and in doing so, it is your responsibility to capture their attention for 90 minutes. It was magical. I fulfilled a childhood dream. I was the first to do it. It was a spiritual journey. I learned a lot. I learned a lot about myself. I learned I have a lot to offer. I am a storyteller. I fell in love with the art of solo performance. </p>
<p>Originally produced with The Collective-NY, we earned the 2016 United Solo Theatre Festival Award for Best One-Man Show, and the 2016 New York International Fringe Festival Award for Overall Excellence in a Solo Performance. In addition, we were nominated for the 2016 Audelco Award for Outstanding Solo Performance.</p>
<p><i>      ""T</i><i>he magnificent observation of the character of 'Mudbone,' as played by Pryor, that Muhammad now portrays, is riveting...</i><i><i>You are watching a master craftsman in action, and it's breathtaking</i>.:--Jacquelyn Claire </i><strong>NY Theatre Guide</strong> </p>
<p>That was Richard's story; I do have my own! Richard taught me a lot, and I am eager to share what I've learned from that experience and where I am now! My second creation, ILLINOIS BOY BLUES, is an original story; it's my story!</p>

<p>...Surprisingly, Mark Twain's work has made a unique impression on me while creating this play. Revisiting his work as an adult has been an enlightening experience. What do Pryor &amp; Twain have in common? Well, for one, they're great chroniclers of childhood! I am deeply inspired by their work. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With your contribution, I will be able to finish off my research trip by traveling to Hannibal, MO (Twain's hometown) &amp; Quincy, IL. This area has a strong influence within the play. Romaine was born in Quincy, IL; a city on the Mississippi River and just across from Mark Twain's hometown Hannibal, MO. It is important that I capture the essence of Quincy so that it is authentic in my storytelling. As the solo performer, I must uphold the imagination of the writer while bringing the words to life as the actor. It is a fully engaged experience that I would love to take you on. </p>
<p>             ""<i>It is the audience who must supply the imagination...What is really important is not to put anything 'over,' but to bring the audience up onto the stage and into the scene with you. It is they who must give you even more than you give them in the way of imagination and creative power</i>."" ~Ruth Draper {Acting Solo; by Jordan R. Young}</p>
<p>In order for me to bring this creation to the stage, and as an Independent Producer, I need all the help I can get. By reaching my goal I will be able to finish off my research and get this play, up on it's feet; I have a story to tell. The cost of making all of this happen can be straining, but it comes with the territory and I have faith that I will be able to make it happen. Some of the expenses include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Travel expenses to Hannibal, MO/Quincy,IL for (4) days</li>
<li>Graphic artist expense                           </li>
<li>Costume/Props                           </li>

<br/>THE PROJECT</h3>
<p>'First Violin' is a solo performance piece by multidisciplinary artist Sean Devare, investigating cultural inheritance and musical evolution through his personal discovery of the oldest ancestor of the violin and its connection to the Hindu epic poem, the Ramayana. With autobiographical spoken word poetry and narration, he chronicles his search for and recreation of the fabled first violin, invented by the demon(ized) King Ravana.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">WHY NOW?</h3>
<p>First Violin asks: where does a culture begin and end, and who can claim it? In examining and re-appropriating  the musical practices of rock icons like the Beatles and Led Zeppelin, Devare undertakes a journey in both artistic and personal discoveries to lend a new voice to the first generation Asian-American experience.</p>

<p>The piece is for people trying to make sense of the cultural collision we are experiencing on a direct level.

It is live performance as devotional prayer to generations past and present.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>How it all began</h3>
<p>When I wrote the book ""Giovanni and the Camino of St. Francis"" and prepared to go on tour, I decided I wanted to do something I had always wanted to do - write and perform a musical based on the life of St. Francis of Assisi. He's been my spiritual mentor since I was young and I believe his message of peace is so important today. Earlier this year I began traveling and sharing ""Brother Sun, Sister Moon"" and I was amazed at the result - especially by how I excited I was to share this beautiful story. </p>
<p>Then the opportunity presented itself to share the musical on the off-Broadway stage. The idea of bringing St. Francis to New York for two weeks was too good to be true, but we began planning the cross country tour. I decided that I would travel across the US as close to how Francis himself would have traveled - penniless and in complete trust. I would need to rely upon people along the way to provide food and shelter, and even a ride from city to city. We even decided to do something in New York that had never been done before - to invite the homeless into the theater each night of the show. During the day I'll join volunteers on the street as we pass out free passes to the musical, then share a bowl of soup with all the attendees before the show begins.</p>
<p>But to accomplish all this we need your help. If we can raise $20,000 we'll be able to accomplish all these goals. I hope you'll consider making a donation - big or small - and help St. Francis share his message with the world. We have so many incentives to spark your imagination, from free downloads to St. Francis and St. Clare dolls knitted here in Mexico.</p>
<p>Take the time to look around and see how you want to help. And St. Francis and I hope to see you on the road.</p>

I decided that I would travel across the US as close to how Francis himself would have traveled - penniless and in complete trust. I would need to rely upon people along the way to provide food and shelter, and even a ride from city to city. We even decided to do something in New York that had never been done before - to invite the homeless into the theater each night of the show. During the day I'll join volunteers on the street as we pass out free passes to the musical, then share a bowl of soup with all the attendees before the show begins.
But to accomplish all this we need your help. If we can raise $20,000 we'll be able to accomplish all these goals. I hope you'll consider making a donation - big or small - and help St. Francis share his message with the world. We have so many incentives to spark your imagination, from free downloads to St. Francis and St. Clare dolls knitted here in Mexico.
Take the time to look around and see how you want to help. And St. Francis and I hope to see you on the road.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Squire Lane Theatrical and Baby Crow Productions are bringing two new theatrical works to Edinburgh Fringe Festival 2017, the first and largest fringe theatre festival in the world.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493301154/hmimpolhu78nzy4yo5do.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p>In theatre, as in life, few things are more important than finding your people. What inevitably brought Squire Lane, Baby Crow, Kevin, Margaret, Joy and I together is a shared belief in the potential for theatre to provoke dialogue, inspire empathy, and provide a platform for socially relevant stories and underrepresented voices.</p>
<p>WHORE: A Kid's Play is also about finding your people. It began 3 years ago as 10-minute play, exploring slut-shaming and internalized sexism and its socialization on the playground. Over the next year and a half, collaborating with different casts and directors, a full-length version began to take shape. Working on the play often became a catalyst for countless stories about childhood friendships, Catholic school, and coming out. In so many respects, these were versions of my story.</p>
<p>Around the same time, Joy (who played a big part in the development of Kids Play) had already begun assembling fragments from her 6th grade journals for the solo play that would eventually become 13 &amp; Not Pregnant.</p>
<p>At one point or another in my life I’ve been all of these characters. For me, writing a play is an act of extreme empathy. There’s a push to expand feeling and understanding into the imagined lives of others. I believe this act of imagining the lives of others has a modest yet profound role in the fight for a more just and tolerant society.</p>
<p>While no play can directly change the problems of society, our hope is that bringing these stories to audiences can bring immediacy and awareness to the struggles of young people who weren’t as lucky as I was.</p>

<p>The CDC reports that suicide is the third leading cause of death among young people, resulting in about 4,400 deaths per year. According to Yale University’s Office of Public Affairs, victims of bullying are 2 to 9 times more likely to consider suicide than non-victim. A study conducted in Britain by the charity <i>Beatbullying</i> says that nearly half of suicides among 10 to 14-year-olds are due to bullying, with girls and gay youth being at particularly high risk.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">“<strong>Young women, those 18-24, experience certain severe types of harassment at disproportionately high levels: 26% of these young women have been stalked online, and 25% were the target of online sexual harassment. In addition, they do not escape the heightened rates of physical threats and sustained harassment common to their male peers and young people in general.</strong>”</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">—Pew Research Center, Online Harassment, 2014</p>

<p><strong>WHORE: A Kid's Play</strong><br/><i>Written by Reese Thompson, Directed by Margaret Grace Hee</i></p>
<p>Set against a backdrop of small-town gossip amplified by social media, limitless shame, and the hell-fire of the confession booth, WHORE: A Kid's Play is a darkly funny account of the pressures to be both normal and exceptional in a world hostile to misfit girls and queer kids, when nothing is quite so momentous as friendship, nor so utterly monstrous as ourselves. #BFF4NOW  #KIDSPLAY4EVER</p>
<p><strong>“Bratty, insolent and wise, WHORE is a mash up of John Hughes, Jean Genet, and Jem and the Holograms.”</strong>   — Stephen Karam (author of <i>Speech &amp; Debate</i> and <i>The Humans</i>)</p>
<p>Jenn, 13, wants two things from God: 1) to be pretty, and 2) for Andrea to be her best friend. Jenn’s arch-nemesis, Patrick, dutifully preps for the Junior Regional Spelling Bee - though what he really wants to do is dance. Meanwhile, Andrea, also 13, just wants someone to tell her if those awkward encounters with Jenn’s stepbrother over summer break mean she’s not a virgin anymore. Years later, when Jenn shows up on Andrea’s doorstep, nursing a concussion, the two must confront the events that led to their falling out as kids.</p>
<p><strong>“Reese (Thompson) is a truly original new voice in the theatre — exploring areas no one else is, saying things no one else would, and finding both humor and meaning in the madness of contemporary life. To be so unique in outlook and talented in execution is beyond rare in emerging artists. His work speaks to our moment with deep wit and insight, and is always a theatrical delight.” </strong>— Christopher Shinn (author <i>Four</i>, <i>Dying City</i>, and <i>Teddy Ferrara</i>)</p>

<p><strong>13 &amp; Not Pregnant</strong><br/><i>Written &amp; Performed by Joy Donze, Directed by Mia Capotorto Sommese</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong> WINNER BEST COMEDY 2016 UNITED SOLO FESTIVAL</strong></p>
<p>With 90’s musical dance tantrums, heartbreaking journal entries, and the severing of dolls heads, 13 &amp; Not Pregnant presents the aggressively hormonal writings of a Midwestern US, nineties, pre-teen as she navigates her erratically evolving girlhood.</p>
<p>The entire show is verbatim entries from Joy Donze‘s 6th grade journal, massaged and spliced &amp; diced in the rehearsal room with Director Mia Capotorto Sommese. The show is developed to be first and foremost universally entertaining. Beyond that, Joy Donze explains, “I wanted go back and explore this crucial pivotal time we all go through; Puberty. When we search within our tormenting selves and dare to ask….who am I?”</p>
<p>“<strong>Hilarious, poignant and shockingly honest!</strong>” -Karen Ludwig (solo performer, author of <i>WHERE WAS I?</i>)</p>
<p>“<strong>I can’t remember the last time I laughed so hard for the entire duration of a show. Go see Joy Donze… SO FUNNY.</strong>” - Daniel Kwiatkowski (thehollowsonline.com)</p>
<p>“<strong>What a fab funny funny show. Go see her!</strong>” - Richard Mazda (Executive Producer - The Secret Theatre NYC)</p>
<p>“<strong>13 &amp; Not Pregnant was both hilarious and honest. It lovingly takes a journey back to a tie where EVERYTHING matters. Young Joy thinks she knows everything, but the audience can laugh and relate because we know she knows nothing.</strong>” - Pamela Wess, filmmaker</p>

<p><strong>""13 &amp; Not Pregnant"" and ""WHORE: A Kid's Play"" evaluate universal themes of youth, gender expectations, bullying, misogyny and the human experience with a heavy influence on the female perspective.</strong></p>
<p>These are relevant, timely subjects that need to be discussed. What a better way to do that then through the theatre.

Baby Crow productions has produced and developed socially aware productions since 2009.</p>
<p><strong>Squire Lane Theatrical</strong> develops and produces socially critical and relevant stories for the stage to provoke dialogue and inspire action on 21st century issues facing our world. With a goal of capturing real people in socially relevant stories, we have a passion for looking in on the lives of those not talked about, the situations that are hard to talk about, and the relationships that can't be talked about.

Squire Lane Theatrical and Baby Crow Productions are bringing two new theatrical works to Edinburgh Fringe Festival 2017, the first and largest fringe theatre festival in the world.
 

In theatre, as in life, few things are more important than finding your people. What inevitably brought Squire Lane, Baby Crow, Kevin, Margaret, Joy and I together is a shared belief in the potential for theatre to provoke dialogue, inspire empathy, and provide a platform for socially relevant stories and underrepresented voices.
WHORE: A Kid's Play is also about finding your people. It began 3 years ago as 10-minute play, exploring slut-shaming and internalized sexism and its socialization on the playground. Over the next year and a half, collaborating with different casts and directors, a full-length version began to take shape. Working on the play often became a catalyst for countless stories about childhood friendships, Catholic school, and coming out. In so many respects, these were versions of my story.
Around the same time, Joy (who played a big part in the development of Kids Play) had already begun assembling fragments from her 6th grade journals for the solo play that would eventually become 13 & Not Pregnant.
At one point or another in my life I’ve been all of these characters. For me, writing a play is an act of extreme empathy. There’s a push to expand feeling and understanding into the imagined lives of others. I believe this act of imagining the lives of others has a modest yet profound role in the fight for a more just and tolerant society.
While no play can directly change the problems of society, our hope is that bringing these stories to audiences can bring immediacy and awareness to the struggles of young people who weren’t as lucky as I was.
— Reese Thompson, playwright, WHORE: A Kid's Play
 

The CDC reports that suicide is the third leading cause of death among young people, resulting in about 4,400 deaths per year. According to Yale University’s Office of Public Affairs, victims of bullying are 2 to 9 times more likely to consider suicide than non-victim. A study conducted in Britain by the charity Beatbullying says that nearly half of suicides among 10 to 14-year-olds are due to bullying, with girls and gay youth being at particularly high risk.
“Young women, those 18-24, experience certain severe types of harassment at disproportionately high levels: 26% of these young women have been stalked online, and 25% were the target of online sexual harassment. In addition, they do not escape the heightened rates of physical threats and sustained harassment common to their male peers and young people in general.”
—Pew Research Center, Online Harassment, 2014
While social media has acted as a particularly dangerous catalyst for the dehumanization of women, the instinct to shame and harass women has strong roots in society that stretch far back.
“It seems the word slut can be applied to any activity that doesn't include knitting, praying, or sitting perfectly still lest any sudden movements be deemed whorish.”
“...people dislike or condemn promiscuity in the abstract, in hypothetical experimental scenarios, or for some distant 'others,' but that they're much more likely to accept it, understand it or excuse it when it concerns themselves or their already close friends.”
 —Zhana Vrangalova, “Do Promiscuous People Really Have Fewer Friends?” Psychology Today
“Technology has ramped it up so much that there are no boundaries ... It’s so faceless and they are free to say whatever, they’re free to say and do whatever without thinking about it.”
—Carol Todd, mother of victim, Amanda Todd
 

WHORE: A Kid's PlayWritten by Reese Thompson, Directed by Margaret Grace Hee
Set against a backdrop of small-town gossip amplified by social media, limitless shame, and the hell-fire of the confession booth, WHORE: A Kid's Play is a darkly funny account of the pressures to be both normal and exceptional in a world hostile to misfit girls and queer kids, when nothing is quite so momentous as friendship, nor so utterly monstrous as ourselves. #BFF4NOW  #KIDSPLAY4EVER
“Bratty, insolent and wise, WHORE is a mash up of John Hughes, Jean Genet, and Jem and the Holograms.”   — Stephen Karam (author of Speech & Debate and The Humans)
Jenn, 13, wants two things from God: 1) to be pretty, and 2) for Andrea to be her best friend. Jenn’s arch-nemesis, Patrick, dutifully preps for the Junior Regional Spelling Bee - though what he really wants to do is dance. Meanwhile, Andrea, also 13, just wants someone to tell her if those awkward encounters with Jenn’s stepbrother over summer break mean she’s not a virgin anymore. Years later, when Jenn shows up on Andrea’s doorstep, nursing a concussion, the two must confront the events that led to their falling out as kids.
“Reese (Thompson) is a truly original new voice in the theatre — exploring areas no one else is, saying things no one else would, and finding both humor and meaning in the madness of contemporary life. To be so unique in outlook and talented in execution is beyond rare in emerging artists. His work speaks to our moment with deep wit and insight, and is always a theatrical delight.” — Christopher Shinn (author Four, Dying City, and Teddy Ferrara)
 

13 & Not PregnantWritten & Performed by Joy Donze, Directed by Mia Capotorto Sommese
 WINNER BEST COMEDY 2016 UNITED SOLO FESTIVAL
With 90’s musical dance tantrums, heartbreaking journal entries, and the severing of dolls heads, 13 & Not Pregnant presents the aggressively hormonal writings of a Midwestern US, nineties, pre-teen as she navigates her erratically evolving girlhood.
The entire show is verbatim entries from Joy Donze‘s 6th grade journal, massaged and spliced & diced in the rehearsal room with Director Mia Capotorto Sommese. The show is developed to be first and foremost universally entertaining. Beyond that, Joy Donze explains, “I wanted go back and explore this crucial pivotal time we all go through; Puberty. When we search within our tormenting selves and dare to ask….who am I?”
“Hilarious, poignant and shockingly honest!” -Karen Ludwig (solo performer, author of WHERE WAS I?)
“I can’t remember the last time I laughed so hard for the entire duration of a show. Go see Joy Donze… SO FUNNY.” - Daniel Kwiatkowski (thehollowsonline.com)
“What a fab funny funny show. Go see her!” - Richard Mazda (Executive Producer - The Secret Theatre NYC)
“13 & Not Pregnant was both hilarious and honest. It lovingly takes a journey back to a tie where EVERYTHING matters. Young Joy thinks she knows everything, but the audience can laugh and relate because we know she knows nothing.” - Pamela Wess, filmmaker
 


Thanks to a $10,000 anonymous donation and seed funding from our team, we've reached the point where we can definitely take these projects to Edinburgh.
We are raising $35,000 to bring ""13 & Not Pregnant"" and ""WHORE: A Kid's Play"" to Edinburgh Fringe Festival and bring these much needed stories to the world.
Edinburgh Fringe Festival is generally not a place to go if you're looking to make money, but rather a festival where artists grow, lifetime networks are built, and new shows get their legs. Bringing two shows with primarily New York based artists is a costly endeavour. Our total cost of producing these projects, including flying cast and crew from New York to Edinburgh, housing them, feeding them, renting venues, marketing the shows and putting up two great shows is approximately $42,648, including about a 10% contingency.
Venues $11,620.49Production $1,373.30Accomodations $5,580.00Travel $5,819.53Press & Marketing $8,593.13Administration $248.00Artist & Creative Fees $5,536.60Contingency $3,877.10
$42,648.15
 


We believe these stories are important and you will want to be a part of the our success, but your investment in this project will give you more than just the ""good feels"".
The first 50 contributors over the $100 level will receive an exclusive ticket to our NYC Preview Performances (July 2017).
We have put together some great perks that will make you a part of the experience as well.  From a very thoughtful Thank You from the cast and crew and the collaborating production companies on all our social media outlets, to a post card from the cast in Edinburgh, to tickets to see the shows, to Official Signed Posters, we've got a little something for everybody.
For those of you looking for more of an experience, we have perks that include a Dance Lesson from our choreographer, Benjamin Rowan, or a Voice Lesson from actor Joy Donze, or maybe you're working on a Monologue for your next audition and you need some help from one of our cast members (all MFA Drama Grads) or our Director Margaret Grace Hee (a MFA Directing Grad).
We also have opportunities for you to sit in on a rehearsal (in New York or Edinburgh) and then have dinner and a 2 hour discussion with a cast member, the director or the playwright. Talk about your playwrighting ideas, interesting in getting into directing, or just want to know the ins and outs of acting in New York City?
Some levels of our perks include tickets to our shows in Edinburgh, but we'll give all levels of our supporters an opportunity to purchase discount tickets for our shows in Edinburgh after the campaign as well.
NEW T-SHIRT DESIGNS


To ease your checkout here on Indiegogo, you will receive a survey a couple weeks after our Indiegogo campaign completes that will allow you to choose the design, color and size of your perk t-shirt, and the design of any branded products.
* Fine Print: All of the experiential perks require you to get there (either NY or Edinburgh), we do not cover the cost of travel or housing. Any unused experiential perks (including tickets) are not refundable; If you cannot get to New York or Edinburgh, maybe we can come up with another perk for you. If you cannot get to a performance on a specific date, we'll try to get you tickets for another performance. Please note that there is only one rehearsal in Edinburgh, so there is only one day where that perk may be ""redeemed"". Some perks that require us to ship something to you are only open to the United States and United Kingdom, but we've done our best to include perks that can be shipped worldwide.

 
 

""13 & Not Pregnant"" and ""WHORE: A Kid's Play"" evaluate universal themes of youth, gender expectations, bullying, misogyny and the human experience with a heavy influence on the female perspective.
These are relevant, timely subjects that need to be discussed. What a better way to do that then through the theatre. Squire Lane Theatrical and Baby Crow Productions believe in creating art with a purpose. With every production we develop and produce, we donate a portion of ticket sales to local causes that make a difference.
Baby Crow Productions focuses on creating work that is accessible to a broad audience, provokes dialogue and inspires action. It is a laboratory for ambitious artists to explore new ways of approaching collaboration in rehearsal and performance. The Flock believes that art can tangibly affect change in the world, by carefully creating and choosing pieces that are socially and environmentally responsible and cultivating relationships with community organizations. Baby Crow productions has produced and developed socially aware productions since 2009.
Squire Lane Theatrical develops and produces socially critical and relevant stories for the stage to provoke dialogue and inspire action on 21st century issues facing our world. With a goal of capturing real people in socially relevant stories, we have a passion for looking in on the lives of those not talked about, the situations that are hard to talk about, and the relationships that can't be talked about. As theatre-makers, and makers of media, we believe we have a responsibility to open people's eyes to the worlds that they have never been introduced to.

With the potential for the funding cut to the National Endowment for the Arts and tightening of budgets for organizations that provide grants and fellowships for artists, we feel that now is one of the most important times to show how important art is to the world.
Our ""artists' pockets"" cannot fund this whole project alone. We've put together an amazing team of professional theatre makers seeking to make great theatre and do good in the world.
Bringing one piece to Edinburgh Fringe Festival is expensive and challenging, but we're bringing two. Planning for this project began over a year ago, we've got pages of pages of marketing plans and production documents outlining our steps to success.
Thankfully with our current level of funds raised, seed funding from the team as well as an anonymous donation from a patron of the arts, we have secured enough funds to take these shows to Edinburgh -- but now we're trying to give the shows the production value and marketing that they deserve.

<p>Alec Duffy and JACK presented my first full play in 2013 based  off of an email and (I think) a deep curiosity of what I would do.  Since then I've covered the audience in plastic Elmo hats, brought dogs into the space, made it snow and hung actors in a giant net over an audience and countless other acts that most theaters wouldn't even entertain.</p>

I have been able to produce and present my own work in NYC and Brooklyn largely in part to my collaborators believing in the work that I do and transcending the limited resources that define self producing in New York.
Alec Duffy and JACK presented my first full play in 2013 based  off of an email and (I think) a deep curiosity of what I would do.  Since then I've covered the audience in plastic Elmo hats, brought dogs into the space, made it snow and hung actors in a giant net over an audience and countless other acts that most theaters wouldn't even entertain.
You, the audience has been there since the beginning and we need you to help us send off 505 1/2 Waverly into the sky and be a stepping stone for the great pastures of JACK's new space.
Things I've done:






 
 
What We Need & What You Get
We need $1500 to get us over the proverbial hump.

The $ will go to the actors and the designers.
DONATE!  We will acknowledge you in an unexpected way.   We will send you a part of JACK.  Hint.  It will be tinfoil.


The Impact
 
I'm proud of the shows I make since I feel like we transcend the traditional budgetary limitations of producing theater in this very complicated city.

Risks & Challenges
Theater in this city is hard.  I'm always amazed by the amount of small donations I receive.  These feel better than the rare large ones I get. (Don't let this sentence stop you though)

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't donate at the moment, I get it!  Come to the show.  Tell others.  Help us close out a chapter of JACK!

<h3>Why a Midwinter Faire?</h3>
<p>About four years ago, I was walking to my car in a typical Rochester snow storm and I found my thoughts turning to warmer weather and start of Renaissance Faire season.  As a Rochester native, I did not find myself pining for warmer climes, but pondering why there was no Ren Faire activity during the winter months.  After discussions with many of my fellow patrons, I confirmed that there was, indeed interest in some sort of Faire-type activity for what has always been considered the ""off-season"".</p>
<p>And that's how the idea for the Midwinter Faire was born.  Now the venue is booked, so we just need your help to make it the best Faire it can possibly be.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Money.  Yeah, I figured you knew that already, but that's what this is all about.  I've worked on shoestring (and no-string) budgets, but this will require real funding to make it work as I know it can.  I have calculated that $5,000 is the minimum amount required to pull this off.</p>
<p>Now, where does that money go?</p>
<ul>
<li>We have budgeted $2,500 towards paying the various acts we're bringing in to make sure a wide variety of entertainment is on display.</li>
<li>$1,500 to cover the rent of the venue itself.</li>
<li>$1,000 for costumes for cast and crew, concessions, programs and the various perks that must be manufactured.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any money raised beyond our initial $5,000 will go towards adding more (and bigger) acts and making the Faire look just as good as it possibly can.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>To help you make up your mind, we've put together a number unique items for all interests and budget levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>A T-shirt to show your dedication to the Faire</li>
<li>A Midwinter Faire collectible pin.  I know there are pin collectors out there who'd like to add the Shield of the Tudor Lilac to their collection!</li>
<li>A personalized video from Phil Shakespeare - Want a sonnet or soliloquy recited?  A tune played for you on the ancient Eunuch Flute?  A reading of a series of stupid jokes by Jonette the Definitely-Not-Elizabethan furry monster?  The possibilities are endless!  (Well, not really.  Let's keep this PG-13...)</li>
<li>Tickets to the show (at a considerable discount)!</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, all items (except the Season Pass) will be available as add-ons to the various perk levels, so you can build your own bundle or add more items!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Become a Backer?</h3>
<p>As I said, the venue is booked, the Faire is happening.  But here are some reasons your support is still essential for the success of the Faire:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advance ticket sales will help with booking of additional acts by showing there will be an audience.</li>
<li>Having a lot of backers (even at lower dollar amounts) helps indicate the demand for this kind of event in the wintertime and could lead to bigger things in the future.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are, of course, several very real risks, as with any venture.</p>
<ul>
<li>Let's face it, this is Rochester.  We could get socked with a massive snowstorm on one or more Faire days.  I'm very much a ""show must go on"" kind of guy, but ""no-travel"" advisories *do* happen. </li>
<li>One or more of the announced acts could, due to unforseen circumstance, back out.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Can't afford to buy anything or just can't make it?  There are other ways you can help us reach our goal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most importantly, spread the word!  If you have friends in the area who might like to see something like this, let them know!</li>
<li>Don't forget the Indiegogo share tools!  Lots of ways to get the word out!</li>
</ul>
</div><h3>In Conclusion</h3><p>I've been working towards something like this for a very long time.  It's an exciting opportunity to do something that's a little bit theater, a little bit Ren Fest and a whole lot of fun.  I hope you can join us for a ride like no other...</p></div>","Why a Midwinter Faire?

<h3>Our Journey Thus Far...</h3>
<p>My name is Eric Berg (in the video, I'm in the middle).  And for the past year, <i>US/THEM</i> has been my passion project.</p>
<p><i>US/THEM </i>was unlike any play I'd read before:  it was magical, yet rooted in reality; radical in its simplicity and compassion; a children's show that would challenge any adult audience.  When I finished the play for the first time, my first thought was, ""I have to put this onstage.""</p>
<p>Luckily, many other talented Dallas theater artists have shared in my passion for this story.  Director, Katy Tye (PRISM CO, Shakespeare in the Bar,) and Actor, Kristen Lazarchick (<i>Radiant Vermin</i> at Kitchen Dog Theatre,) both agreed to come onto the project before we even had a theater in which to perform!  It was a challenge to find a theater willing to produce ""a children's play about terrorism,"" but Echo Theatre was up to the task.</p>
<p>We have a theater.  We have a cast.  We have a story that aches to be told. </p>
<p>But we need your donation to complete the final part of our journey and make this production a reality!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559783469/a9hrjzbwcxx0lbj0l1f8.png"" src=""""/></p>

</h3>
<p>After the tragedy of the Beslan School Siege,  adult society fractured the story into different competing narratives about what happened and who to blame.  <i>US/THEM</i> is a play that focuses the conversation back on the children, giving them control over their own story.</p>
<p>Because this is a story about schoolchildren, it is important that students--the children who would've been affected by the events of this play--get to hear this story.  This play will be a starting point for conversations between adults and children about the difficult topic of terrorism.</p>
<p>To that end, Echo Theatre is offering up to four student matinees, specifically designed to give young people (ages 13 and up) access to the show.  There will be a Pay-What-You-Can preview to ensure price does not keep anyone out of the conversation.  And every performance will have a talk-back moderated by a trained trauma specialist.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How Your Donation Matters</h3>
<p>Before any of this important work can be done, we have to fund the production itself. Most of our budget has already been accounted for, but there are still some crucial elements of the production that must be funded:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559753241/purzronct438m4iql2a8.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Artist Stipends</strong> <strong>($1000)</strong> – It takes many, many talented people to produce a play, from actors and directors to designers and stage managers.  We have the funds to pay most of our dedicated artists, but we still need your help to raise the last $1,000. Echo believes in respecting their artists and paying people for their time.  If we do not raise enough to meet our goal, we may be forced to sacrifice other elements of the production in order to pay the artists.</p>
<p><strong>Set ($500)</strong> –The set is a crucial part of the children’s story telling; it is not just a backdrop behind the actors, but a part of the play itself. This modest set budget will give the actors the tools they need to make the play come to life!</p>
<p><strong>Props</strong> <strong>($500) </strong>– This play uses a lot of hand props: chalk, string, balloons, etc.  These items are not expensive individually, but over time the items add up. If we only use <strong>20 balloons</strong> per performance, <strong>13 performances</strong> makes <strong>260 balloons</strong>—and if you account for balloons in rehearsal, it brings the total number of balloons to<strong> almost 500</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>Costumes ($170) </strong>– The actors need clothes! There are hidden costs in keeping the costumes fresh for the duration of the run: incidental repairs, post-show dry cleaning, etc.  Your money will literally keep clothes on the actors’ backs!</p>
<p><strong>Lighting &amp; SFX ($80)</strong> – There are a few theatrical goodies that will be used for this show.  If we do not meet our goal, the special effects will be the first items to be cut.  You can stop that from happening with your donation!</p>
<p><strong>Sound ($50) </strong>– Our phenomenal sound designer, Claire Carson, needs your help to make our production sound as good as it looks.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<p>I am a native from Martinique and I have been living in Europe for thirty four years. I left Martinique very young to become a dancer and that's what happened! I have studied dance in Paris and in Brussels and started my career as a dancer in London and then in Lyon, France, before travelling to Italy. I fell in love with this beautiful country and I met my husband with who I work occasionally. I am not a dancer anymore and I work as a freelance Ballet Master and I am embarking on the path of choreography, I am therefore a young choreographer though I already staged different dance pieces.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I launch this campaign to raise money to face part of the costs of the production for my choreographic work which is about identity.</p>
<p>This project means a lot to me because I was born and raised until I was sixteen in Martinique, where the questioning about identity has been a long and difficult path for the natives of the island.<br/>This theme is central in Europe and North America and my project involves artists from Europe and Martinique and will be created between Italy and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>In fact I will work with two italian dancers and two martiniquan dancers in Italy and then we will create the show in Martinique in March 2018, then will follow a tour in Guadeloupe and in french Guyana before traveling back to Italy, where we will perform.</p>
<p>If you choose to help us with a donation, even small, it will be a great gesture that will bring us closer to our goal and and you will help an idea and an artistic project to take shape and to achieve.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<p>We will need 3000 euros to pay the flights from Italy to Martinique, for two dancers and myself, in fact the flight expenses are very high and our supporters don't pay them.</p>
<p>If 300 of you make a donation of 10 euros we can reach our goal very soon and cope with major spending in our budget. </p>
<p>Once travels to and from Italy paid, we ensure the opportunity to create the show in Martinique and to be able to represent it in Italy.</p>
<p>It is important to reach our goal, 3000 euros, otherwise the funds will be reimbursed to donors and we won't have the opportunity to travel to Martinique.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<p>This project is important to us and we are passionate about it because it contains notions such as self-representation and self-consciousness.</p>
<p>It is of utmost importance not only to the Western world especially at this historic moment in which a war is fought to affirm a religious identity and a sense of belonging.</p>
<p>We will discuss the subject from the philosophical thoughts expressed by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari from which Edouard Glissant, poet and philosopher of Martinique, is inspired to express his concept of plural identity, in opposition to a unique root identity.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<p>We have to find at least 300 donors and we risk not reaching our goal and therefore not be able to cope with travel expenses to fly to Martinique but we want to make everyone aware of the issue we will face and its importance.</p>
<p>We will organize meetings during which you can discuss with us and ask us all the questions you will want about the project and its implementation.</p>
<p>We will campaign on social media to spread the voice and strengthen our intent and actively engage the associations dealing with identity, gender and sexual orientation and meet the French expatriates in Italy to make them aware of our project and the identity issue.</p>
</div><div>
<p>Please if you can't donate make some noise about our campaign and share using the Indiegogo share tools.</p>
<p>Thank you all!</p>

We will discuss the subject from the philosophical thoughts expressed by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari from which Edouard Glissant, poet and philosopher of Martinique, is inspired to express his concept of plural identity, in opposition to a unique root identity.

 
We have to find at least 300 donors and we risk not reaching our goal and therefore not be able to cope with travel expenses to fly to Martinique but we want to make everyone aware of the issue we will face and its importance.
We will organize meetings during which you can discuss with us and ask us all the questions you will want about the project and its implementation.
We will campaign on social media to spread the voice and strengthen our intent and actively engage the associations dealing with identity, gender and sexual orientation and meet the French expatriates in Italy to make them aware of our project and the identity issue.

Please if you can't donate make some noise about our campaign and share using the Indiegogo share tools.
Thank you all!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Natural Wonders and Awkward Conversations</h3>
<p>Imagine a man, a writer, lost in mid life, as he drives across the American West with his estranged stepdaughter-a young woman at the beginning of hers. In a series of increasingly desperate attempts to rescue something from the wreckage of divorce, they test how much they can trust each other, or whether that will ever be possible again.</p>

<h3><strong>Who We Are</strong></h3>
<p>This compelling play touches on vivid themes of the contemporary American family, and offers the actors career changing roles. Dexter Knowlton Strong as 'Monkey Man' and <a href=""http://www.sarabrownactor.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sara Brown</a> as 'Bitch' met during actor training sessions at the <a href=""https://www.thefreemanstudio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Freeman Studio</a> in NY city and are developing a strong connection as working partners in early rehearsals. </p>

<p>The author, <a href=""http://www.leeblessing.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lee Blessing</a>, is a playwright with numerous international credits. His  Pulitzer-nominated work <i>A Walk in the Woods</i> was produced last year at the <a href=""http://www.barrowstreettheatre.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Barrow Street Theater</a> in Manhattan.

<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
</div><div><ul>
<li>We aim to raise $14,000 to fully realize this project. Our largest expenses are rental fees for the venue, (for which we have already made a deposit) and scenic video projection. This element is essential for capturing the visual power of the landscape, allowing it to become an important character within the narrative. If we exceed our fundraising goal we will simply expand the production capacity of the projection element by using a more advanced equipment set up. Content will not change, delivery will. </li>
<li>If we do not meet our goal we will still mount a powerful production. Blessing's spare economy as a writer has enough impact to bring the essential qualities of these places into the imagination. If parts of cinematic component have to be cut for budget reasons we will still be successful in bringing to life the nuanced world these characters inhabit. </li>
<li>We want to show our gratitude with a number of fun perks, including weekend getaways, local sailing trips, vintage postcards, private yoga classes, culinary delights and free tickets for each of the eight performances. Any contribution amount is welcome, and we will be sure to mention you prominently in the Playbill. </li>
</ul></div><div>
<h3>Why now, why us?</h3>
<ul>
<li>This will be the first time that Great Falls has been produced in New York City, and it is exciting to be part of the effort that brings these characters to life in the heart of the American theater.</li>
<li>In doing so, this showcase will highlight the emerging talents of Dexter Knowlton Strong and Sara Brown, newcomers to the New York stage, and a successful run will position them to grow their careers on both stage and screen. </li>
<li>Thematically, this play remains relevant to the current discussions around the #MeToo movement in nuanced ways. Blessing's characters wrestle with these issues in countless surprising ways, so please join us in delving into this complex conversation. </li>

<p>We at Outlet Ensemble started putting up plays as new artists in the New York theatre scene with a hunger to practice and work in our craft. With each production we have grown more and more ambitious and want to give back to the community through the pieces that we present. </p>
<p>The lens through which we are presenting our upcoming project, Brilliant Traces by Cindy Lou Johnson, is that of exploring dissociative disorder, depression, dementia, generalized anxiety and other ailments of the mind with a compassionate, humor helps heal type attitude. </p>
<p>With your help we can put up quality, conscientious work that provides a stigma-free environment and allows tough subject matter to be not only palatable to as wide an audience as possible, but help facilitate the conversation on how we can help and spread awareness.</p>
<p>We also want to donate %5 of our ticket sales to a worthy organization that helps continue the conversation and provide help to those who are struggling. With your donation, we can produce a platform that can help in the best way we know how. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The campaign goal is $7,000 which is just under 60% of our total budget for the show. The other 40% is coming from funds that were earned from our previous production, Uncle Vanya adapted by Kevin Gay.</p>
<p>This money is going directly to the purchasing and construction of the set, sound &amp; lighting equipment, costumes, music &amp; composition and the people who collaborate on stringing all of these design elements together to put on a show. It is also going towards promotion materials, rehearsal rentals and rental of the performance space. All of these moving parts come together to create quality entertainment with a compassionate heart and the spirit to spread awareness through dialogue. We want to share that with <i>you</i>!</p>
<p>This is a quirky, fun show with an emotional awareness and sympathetic soul and we have the team to match! We want to entertain our audiences and we want you to join us on this journey!</p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal, the money will still go to all of the elements of the production, but may not get all of the resources they deserve. However, the show must go on, and we are determined to see this project through while spreading compassion with our storytelling. Either way, we hope to see you there!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When you contribute to this campaign you are contributing to support a diverse group of artists dedicated to help the community through practicing what they love. We include compensation for all of the artists we work with, and the material they provide us with. For <i>Uncle Vanya</i> we commissioned a playwright for a the brand new adaptation we presented as well as an artist to do the promotional art, as well as utilized original music (played live) from the emerging band Boy Band. For <i>Gruesome Playground Injuries</i> we took artists fresh out of college and gave them a paid platform to practice their art. </p>
<p>Even for this project we have already commissioned a fabulous artist, Tasha Gross, for her work which you see on this very campaign. On top of that, for this project we have a specific vision to help spread awareness of certain mental health issues. Hopefully have enough momentum and a large enough audience to also raise funds to help in the monetary sense as well with a 5% ticket sales donation to an organization that directly helps people.  </p>
<p>Our last two very successful, full-scale productions, <i>Uncle Vanya </i>(Spring 2017) and<i> Gruesome Playground Injuries</i> (Spring 2016), were made possible through campaigns just like this. We are asking, yet again, for your help</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>When finances are tight, one of the first things to suffer is our promotion. This is the longest run (7 performances) that we're doing, to date. That being said, we want to be able to fill the house and share the collective vision of our team with as many people as possible. These funds help provide not only the practical tools directly related to the mounting of the production, but the promotional tools we need to spread our word on our production and message of compassion in relation to mental health struggles. </p>
<p>With these funds we are going to promote in schools and in the theatrical community and beyond to help get the word out. As a new company it's difficult to build a loyal audience, but with each passing production, more and more people are entertained as well as impassioned by what we are doing and where we want to go. We want to continue to provide the best quality product that we possibly can to continue this organic growth. Hopefully, and with your help, we can bring to the table tough conversations in a beautiful yet pragmatic way.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even $5 goes such a long way, but if you are unable to donate, that's ok! We encourage you to come see our production live and be a part of the conversation. We also have the original artwork (signed by the artists who created the pieces, cast and design teams) for this production and from our previous production up for sale. For more inquiry on that please contact us directly at outletensemblenyc@gmail.com!</p>

<p>If you are out of state and are unable to come to the show or donate, that's ok too! Part of our mission is to spread awareness about this campaign, this production and this company. That being said, it would be a major help if you could share, share, share this with others who also might be interested in donating, coming to the show or just spreading the love with sharing our message!</p>

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>Middle Child is a not for profit theatre company, committed to making performances that reflect and promote the lives of Hull's residents.</p>
<p>Our annual panto is held at Fruit on Humber Street. The aim is to produce an affordable and alternative show for families in Hull to enjoy each year. Produced since 2012, we have always put local storylines, characters and references at the heart of the production. Tickets are affordable for families living in Hull and a fraction of the cost of other annual pantomimes that run at well-known theatres within the city.</p>
<p>In 2017, we will be working with nationally-acclaimed playwright Tom Wells - a Hull local himself - on a production of 'Cinderella'. The show will star a cast of seven local performers, with the local production company all based in the city. With 26 shows scheduled between the 16 and 30 December, we are expecting to welcome over 3,000 Hull family and friends through the panto doors this Christmas.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What we'll deliver</h3>
<ul>
<li>pay for the making and purchase of the set, props and costume needed</li>
<li>subsidise general admission ticket prices</li>
<li>200 tickets to be given away to community groups in Hull most in need</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Why it's a great idea</h3>
<p>We want more families in Hull to have the opportunity to attend the theatre, as watching theatre can often be a defining moment that stays with you for the rest of your life. Our panto is an affordable alternative for any family wanting to take their child to see their first professional pantomime production.</p>
<p>For the past four years, we have also given away free tickets to William Booth House, an organisation providing services to the homeless throughout Hull. The offer has consistently been met with joy, at a time of year when many are most in need of some cheer. We would love to extend this offer to other organisations in 2017 - if you are interested please email mungo@middlechildtheatre.co.uk.</p>

</div></div>","Αυτό το καλοκαίρι ανεβάζουμε τις «Τρεις Αδελφές» του Άντον Τσέχωφ και χρειαζόμαστε τη βοήθειά σας για να χρηματοδοτήσουμε την παραγωγή!


Μπορείτε να προσφέρετε όσο λίγο ή πολύ θέλετε. Έχουμε δημιουργήσει επίσης κάποια προνόμια για να σας ευχαριστήσουμε για τη βοήθειά σας, βρείτε τα στη δεξιά πλευρά της σελίδας.

This summer, we're producing Anton Chekhov's ""Three Sisters"" and we need your help to fund its production!
Watch the video in English


Το Athens Acting Studio είναι ένα μέρος όπου καλλιτέχνες έρχονται μαζί, εργάζονται πάνω στη τέχνη τους και δημιουργούν νέα έργα. Είναι ένα μέρος όπου εργαζόμαστε για τη δημιουργία ανεξάρτητων καλλιτεχνών με νέες ιδέες. Αντιμετωπίζουμε όλους ως καλλιτέχνες από τη πρώτη ημέρα και θέλουμε όλοι πραγματικά να αισθάνονται έτσι. Δουλεύουμε ανοίγοντας το μυαλό και ξεκλειδώνοντας το σώμα.
The Athens Acting Studio is a place for people and artists to come together to work on their craft and develop new work. It’s a place where we work on creating individual artists with new ideas. We treat everyone as an artist from day one and we want people to feel that way. We work by opening the mind and unlocking the body.




ΓΙΑΤΙ ΤΟ ΚΑΝΟΥΜΕ;
Ο Νίκος Κατής ρώτησε: “Γιατί να το κανουμε τώρα;”. Είναι το κατάλληλο έργο για το σήμερα. Αντικατοπτρίζει το αδιέξοδο της κοινωνίας αυτή τη στιγμή στην Ελλάδα. Οι άνθρωποι θέλουν κάτι, αναζητούν την ταυτότητά τους, αλλά περιμένουν, είναι σε αδράνεια. Συνεχώς μιλάμε για το παρελθόν και το μέλλον, αλλά όχι για το σήμερα. Πού πάμε ως κοινωνία;
WHY WE DO (WHAT WE DO)Nikos Katis, the Director, asked “Why do this now?”. It’s the right play for this moment in time, he says. It shows the stalemate of our society right now in Greece. People want something, question their identity but are waiting, in inactivity. We constantly talk about the past and the future but not about now. Where are we going as a society?

<i>Wendy's Shadow</i>:</h3>
<div>The mischievous and magical adventure of Peter Pan is retold from Wendy’s modern-day perspective with a contemporary folk/rock score. With Music and Lyrics by David Maglione and Tomas Ruiz and Book by Jason Cannon, <i>Wendy's Shadow</i> takes the audience back to the Neverland — where dreams are born, and time is never planned — and asks if it’s ever possible to leave the one you loved.</div>
<div>
<h3>History:</h3>
<div>We (Dave and Tomas) began writing songs for a potential Peter Pan musical in 2013. In the summer of 2014, we approached Jason Cannon to write the book. By that November, we presented the first draft of the show at the Irvington Town Hall Theatre, as part of their new works series. Following the reading, we worked a second draft of the score, orchestrated it for a 7 piece band and presented a concert reading at The Cutting Room in NYC. More edits and reworks took place for an 11 track concept album that was recorded at Water Music Recorders, in April of 2015. </div>

<p><b>In it, I play four roles: myself; Donald; Donald as Dusty; Dusty Springfield</b></p>
<p><b>We were kids growing up in Aberdeen in the 60s and my older brother, Donald, was fascinated with Dusty Springfield.  With a boy scout eagle-eyed attention, he took in her every gesture and shift of gaze when she sang on the TV programmme, Ready Steady Go!  Whenever my parents were out, Donald quickly changed into my mother's long evening dress, evening gloves, diamante earrings and high-heels.  I was recruited (reluctantly) to sit by the long mirror and award him points for how well he could ""do Dusty"".  Donald swanned across the carpet watching himself in the mirror as he sang ""Wishin' and Hopin' over and over again, trying hard to reproduce what he'd seen on TV.   He was never satisfied.  I was bored.  Donald knew he was gay and Dusty was the only other gay person he was aware of.  It was Dusty and Donald on one side and the rest of Aberdeen on the other. </b></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>During the early 70's Donald was a singer and dancer in the television troupe, The Young Generation - they were a vibrant, fun-loving bunch of dancers, without a hint of cynicism. I was fortunate to access some footage from the BBC, of a  show in which Dusty and The Young Generation both perform. Watch the video for a wee glimpse.</b></p>

We were kids growing up in Aberdeen in the 60s and my older brother, Donald, was fascinated with Dusty Springfield.  With a boy scout eagle-eyed attention, he took in her every gesture and shift of gaze when she sang on the TV programmme, Ready Steady Go!  Whenever my parents were out, Donald quickly changed into my mother's long evening dress, evening gloves, diamante earrings and high-heels.  I was recruited (reluctantly) to sit by the long mirror and award him points for how well he could ""do Dusty"".  Donald swanned across the carpet watching himself in the mirror as he sang ""Wishin' and Hopin' over and over again, trying hard to reproduce what he'd seen on TV.   He was never satisfied.  I was bored.  Donald knew he was gay and Dusty was the only other gay person he was aware of.  It was Dusty and Donald on one side and the rest of Aberdeen on the other. 

During the early 70's Donald was a singer and dancer in the television troupe, The Young Generation - they were a vibrant, fun-loving bunch of dancers, without a hint of cynicism. I was fortunate to access some footage from the BBC, of a  show in which Dusty and The Young Generation both perform. Watch the video for a wee glimpse.

Most recently, MHDW was selected by the Moving Beauty Series to present 45 minutes of original work on a split bill in early March. The selection of works being presented in The Series represent an excellent cross-section of the diverse repertoire of Monica Hogan Danceworks, highlighting the company’s refined sense of movement detail. Each of these pieces explores, honors, and celebrates the complexity and intimacy of human relationships in a unique way.The performance will be the company’s largest New York premiere to date and will feature seasoned Company dancers alongside a number of new Apprentices. MHDW is thrilled for this opportunity to present these new works featuring a full ensemble. With this growth comes increased responsibility to our performing artists and the greater dance community. It is important at MHDW that we compensate the tremendous efforts of these exceptionally talented artists. _____________________________________________Here is where you come in -- fans, family, friends, dancers, and dance-lovers alike!

<p>""Comfort Women: A New Musical"" is raising funds to support it's budget.  With your donation, we will be able to pay some of our cast of over 50 actors.  With the funds raised, we will buy more advertising space to help promote and market ""Comfort Women: A New Musical.""  Set in 1941, Comfort Women takes us to Seoul, Korea, where we meet Goeun, a young woman whose brother is attempting to revolt against the Imperial Japanese Army. Goeun meets a man who promises her a good paying job at a factory in Tokyo.  Feeling like she has no other options to support her family, she chooses to leave her home and take the job.  Unfortunately Goeun soon realizes that this is not the dream opportunity that she has been promised.  She is held hostage, transported to Indonesia, and is forced to become a Japanese Imperial Army sexual slave. We follow Goeun through this life-altering experience as she befriends fellow slaves (Comfort Women) and they plan their impossible escape.  </p>
<p>Comfort Women is based on the real-life accounts of a few of the approximately 200,000 women who were trafficked into sexual slavery by the Japanese Army from 1930- 1945.  Women and girls as young as 14 were coerced or kidnapped from their homes and forced to service 50 to 100 soldiers a day.  As a result of this treatment, combined with unsafe practices, only 25- 30% of these women survived the war, and those who did live were forever changed.  Comfort Women gives voice to a story that has been silenced far too long.  </p>
<p>During World War II, approximately 200,000 women – and young teenagers – from across Asia were forced into sexual slavery at “comfort stations” for the Imperial Japanese Army. Inspired by testimonies from the women survivors, ""COMFORT WOMEN: A New Musical"" features a cast of fifty-three Asian &amp; Asian-American actors to tell these stories which are excluded from history books.  The breakdown of the money raised is simple:  </p>
<p>1) $11,000 (34%) to buy Advertisements across NYC, including PR Newswire.</p>
<p>2) $5,500 (17%) to purchase additional Sound and Lighting equipment.</p>
<p>3) $16,000  (49%) to pay some of our cast.</p>
<p>Each audience member will receive a copy of ""CAN YOU HEAR US: The Untold Narratives of Comfort Women."" A portion of proceeds will go to ""House of Sharing,"" the home for surviving Comfort Women living in South Korea.  Currently, we are in rehearsals, in Manhattan, NY. We're planning for an Off-Broadway Debut at the Theatre of St Clements on July 31st. Every purchased ticket will receive the book, ""Can You Hear Us? A collection of interviews with Comfort Women survivors"". But we need your help to get us to that next level. </p>
<p>We launched this campaign to raise money for the Marketing and Promoting of our musical. We want to reach as many people as possible, We feel that this is an important subject that needs to brought into the light. We need your help to get this show out there, for people to see. We have carefully chosen social media marketing campaigns that are focused on interested local audiences.

<p>Like most things in New York City, mounting a show is very expensive, yet our total budget of $8,000 enables this production of Straight Faced Lies to best serve the material without being extravagant.</p>
<p>Our incredible actors, who all have significant theater credits, are generously working for far below what they are worth, yet still need to be paid fairly. Similarly, a great stage manager and production crew are vital to keep things running smoothly. Participation and insurance fees quickly add up, while excellent marketing (including postcards and program ads) will ensure that Straight Faced Lies stands out among Fringe's many other shows.</p>

Hailed as ""one of the year's best new plays"" by New YorkTheatre.com, Straight Faced Lies is excited to be an official selection of this year's New York International Fringe Festival (FringeNYC.)
Grab a plate, sharpen your knives, and join us for an unforgettable Thanksgiving with the Ryans, where family battles are as bitter as the cranberry sauce and the secrets more delicious than the stuffing. 
To be selected to perform in FringeNYC is an esteemed honor, and the biggest step in the show's development process thus far. As the largest performing arts festival in North America, FringeNYC will provide the cast, director and playwright with a one-of-a-kind opportunity to showcase our work to new, diverse audiences. Your tax-deductible contribution through this campaign or our contribution page  is vital to our success.
Production Budget Breakdown




Like most things in New York City, mounting a show is very expensive, yet our total budget of $8,000 enables this production of Straight Faced Lies to best serve the material without being extravagant.
Our incredible actors, who all have significant theater credits, are generously working for far below what they are worth, yet still need to be paid fairly. Similarly, a great stage manager and production crew are vital to keep things running smoothly. Participation and insurance fees quickly add up, while excellent marketing (including postcards and program ads) will ensure that Straight Faced Lies stands out among Fringe's many other shows.
Cast and Creative



MAN DOWN Productions is proud to introduce our extraordinary cast (pictured from left to right): Geraldine Librandi (HBO: The Sopranos), Curtis Wiley (Off Broadway: Pageant - The Musical), Cindy Marchionda (City Center Encores: The Apple Tree; Joseph Jefferson Award Best Actress in Kiss of the Spider Woman), Jacob Thompson (Olympus Records - FringeNYC), Dana Domenick (Illuminati - Planet Connections Award, Outstanding Lead Actress), and Joey Collins (Broadway: The Glass Menagerie; Off-Broadway: Bug). 




Director Andrew Block received the Ovation and L.A. Drama Critics Circle Awards for Best Director and Best Production for his world premiere production of Small Engine Repair. He has several critically-acclaimed and sold-out productions in FringeNYC, including an extension to the Encore Series at the Lucille Lortel, as well as numerous productions in NYC and regionally, Best Director and Best Play awards in a variety of NY festivals, and a GLAAD Media nomination for Outstanding Theatre. Andrew is also the Manager of Off-Off Broadway Services at Theatre Development Fund (TDF).
Playwright Mark Jason Williams is a multi-award winning playwright and essayist. His plays have been produced in New York City, Chicago, Minneapolis, Washington D.C., and his essays are published by Salon, Out Magazine, Jezebel and the Daily Dot. Mark has a BFA in Dramatic Writing from NYU's Tisch School of the Arts. His play, Recovery (also directed by Andrew Block), was an audience favorite in the 2011 New York International Fringe Festival. 

MAN DOWN PRODUCTIONS (Producer) is dedicated to creating continued, collaborative relationships with playwrights, and development of work fresh to the New York Stage. The company was founded by Andrew Block and Steven De Luca in 2014. Man Down's most recent show, Why Bother? An Evening of One Act Comedies, was awarded Outstanding Overall Production at The Planet Connections Theatre Festivity. 
This talented ensemble of artists is sure to make a splash in this year's Fringe, but we need your help to make this production possible.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Bhawani Bashir Yasir, an alumnus of the National
School of Drama in New Delhi, founded the Ensemble Kashmir Theatre Akademi
(EKTA) in 1988. Although EKTA could not remain functional after the militant
insurgency in 1990, it was re-invigorated in 2004 to re-enforce a new
spirit in the theatre movement of Kashmir. <span>Under the aegis
of the Ensemble – EKTA School of Drama-&amp;-Repertory was established in March
2006, to pave the way for providing professional training in Theatre Arts to
promising young artistes in Kashmir, who are otherwise deprived of avenues to
go outside the state. The School awards different short-term and full
term courses, including a one year Professional Diploma course and a six-month
certificate course in Theatre Arts, under the academic guidance and principles
of National School of Drama, New Delhi; admitting 20-25 students every year. </span></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
The Colorado Improv Awards was founded by longtime improvisers, Emily March and Chris Gallegos, when they decided that Colorado needed to recognize and pay tribute to the hard work being done by improvisers across the state. As an improviser, Emily has performed consistently for over 15 years and continues to be a driving force behind many improv groups playing in and around Denver today. Chris Gallegos was one of the founding members of the Denver Improv Festival and the GroupMind Foundation and has been an improviser since 2001, and performs in groups such as the musical improv group SoundBox and Makeshift Shakespeare and produces Radio Voodoo, a monthly, live improvised show.
Chris and Emily produced the inaugural CIA's on a shoestring budget, and it was a great success, but in 2015, they have decided to create an event worthy of the performers being honored. That means moving the awards to the Jones Theater in Denver, a larger and prestigious theater in the Denver performing community.
The change of venue as well as the costs of creating the awards (each award is handcrafted by Emily herself...seriously), fees, costs for promotion and additional staffing, means an increase in the budget that requires your help to fund.

What We Need & What You Get
All of the funds collected will go directly to paying the rental fee of the Jones Theater ($1,100) as well as the cost of the awards (approximately $500), decoration costs, and a stipend for a small, but dedicated staff.
If you are a performer in Denver or Colorado, you understand the impact that being recognized for your work can have on a performer.  Your donation will make it a wonderful and memorable night for improvisers who work hard to entertain the masses.


The Impact
The Denver improv scene is relatively new if compared to places like Chicago or New York. However, we are regularly producing top notch improv performers who have gone on to create shows like ""Girls Only"" and ""The Grawlix"" and ""Governor Jack"" all nationally recognized improv groups that originated in Denver.  Most awards and media take note of traditional actors as well as stand up comics, but until now, there has been nothing to honor the work of the very talented improvisers in Colorado.  Your donation can help change that.


Risks & Challenges
The Colorado Improv Awards works to not only honor the improv performers working today, but also to recognize those who laid the foundation that helped bring the art to where it is now.  Without your help, it will be very difficult to honor those we enshrine into the Colorado Improv Hall of Fame and to create the kind of event that is worthy of the work being done on stages every night in Colorado


Other Ways You Can Help
Please help us by donating and spreading the word about the Colorado Improv Awards. Any amount helps and letting others know can only help our effort.  thank you so much for donating.  Also, if you donate, you will receive a handwritten letter from an improvisers you have adopted.  It will be typed up and printed out and sent to you via email telling you about shows they are performing in that you should probably go see.  Thank you again!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

The extraordinary cast blends Shakespeare’s original text with puppetry, violent choreography, and the incredible storytelling Immercity is known for. <span>This design concept combines Norse, Celtic and Greek folklore to create a uniquely mythic world. The audience will bear witness as the sisters weave the winding threads that determine the fate of all humankind. Embedded in this timeless place of powerful sorcery, the audience watch and assist as the three sisters manipulate Macbeth’s life from afar. There will be a live percussive score and elemental magic that uses fire, earth and water as part of the sister’s ominous rituals.</span></span></p>
<p><b>So Why All-Female?</b></p>
<p>I was frustrated by the lack of strong female roles compared to the number of amazing female actors. It’s not intentionally feminist to cast more women than men, it actually makes for better theatre because you have more choice. I get hundreds of women replying to open casting calls, I rarely get more than ten men.</p>
<p> The production will premiere for two nights in the gardens at Tymperlys in Colchester. In July it will move to an R&amp;D period in Bruges, followed by a short run at the Heilige Magdalenakerk, a deconsecrated church. After this it will have a London run in the autumn at a TBC venue.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need £2,000 in order to pay for rehearsal space and travel during our initial rehearsal period in June, as well as costume/props/set for the production, We also need the funds to cover our trip to Colchester and Bruges, where we have been invited to research the production and perform it. Finally, we need the funds to hire three actors, a fight director, and a musician. Everything is in place - we just need the funds to do it! So, as a thank you for supporting our campaign, here's what you get:</p>
<p>£1- THANK YOU: Yes, for just one pound you will get a personalized thank you on ImmerCity and MSP's social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, and our website). Way to go, you star!</p>
<p>£5 - SPELL (For good, not evil): We will personally create a spell in haiku form that will bring you good fortune, and post it to your social media profiles/e-mail it to you.</p>
<p>£10 - FREE POTION! ImmerCity is hosting several parties and events over the next few months in London and in Bruges, and if you donate £10 you will recieve a free potion, courtesy of the Wyrd sisters. Events are free entry, and you can find out more about them on ImmerCity's website.</p>
<p>£25 - THE MACBETH KIT: In addition to a spell posted to your social media profiles, we will print the spell onto an origami raven and post it to you along with your own thread of life and a poster for the show featuring original artwork by acclaimed calligrapher Brody Neuenschwander.</p>
<p>£50 - FREE TICKET OR DRINKS AND A VIDEO: You can chose: one free ticket to the production in Colchester or Bruges, or a free cocktail at EVERY MacBeth fundraising event throughout the summer. You will also receive a video of ImmerCity's company singing your spell to the tune of your choice.</p>
<p>There rewards are all accumulative - so for instance, if you donate £25 you will also receive a spell posted to your social media page+a thank you online+one free cocktail at any ImmerCity event, and if you donate £50 you will receive the MacBeth kit plus a free ticket/cocktails/video+the kit+spell on social media+a thank you.</p>
<p>If you wish to donate more than £50, please contact ImmerCity directly, as this would make you eligible to enter onto our sponsorship program, which includes year-round perks including free tickets, free drinks, and personal time with the artists.</p>
<p>If you are planning to donate in a foreign currency, please note that we will be charged $25 for each foreign transaction. Please contact Maggie at maggieschroeder@sbcglobal.net if you wish to donate in USD, EUR, or any other non-GBP currency.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire funding goal, the money will be spent on the bare minimum - travel, production costs, and hiring the talent - but we will be charged more by Indiegogo!</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Aside from this massive opportunity to support women in the arts - where female fight directors are consistently paid less than their male counterparts and given fewer opportunities - this project will help to launch ImmerCity as an international company. Travelling to Bruges as part of an international festival will allow us to work with artists from around the world and develop audiences in mainland Europe. Our goal is that by financing this production, we will be able to continue as a company without asking for crowdfunding money again.</p>

But you can still provide massive support to our campaign by sharing our crowdfunder and our project on social media, and talking about it to people you know might be interested. You can also purchase tickets to the show (if you buy ahead of time online you get a discount!), or come along to one of our (FREE!) fundraising events. Finally, if you know anyone who would be interested in getting involved with the project, providing free rehearsal space, discounted materials, or perhaps providing a venue in or outside of the UK, please get in touch.

KING DICK the play


The Manson case is in full swing, and we’re knee deep in Vietnam…. and as if that isn't fucked enough, Mercury is in retrograde.


Christmastime, 1970: The King just spent 100 G’s on gifts, and he’s on the run from Graceland. His kata form cannot be topped. He pops pills like peanut butter and banana sandwiches but leaves needles and drugs to the doctors. Underneath it all, his momma’s lesson stays with him – to give to those in need. After a horrifying vision, The King concocts a scheme to offer the leader of the free world his influential voice in exchange for a new symbol of power.
King Dick examines the true events that led Elvis Presley to seek out President Richard Nixon, the only man with more pull than E himself, for a Federal Agent-at-Large badge. He wants to do his part to save the youth from the perils of drugs. The future of our great country depends on The King – Elvis – a man who will buy 40 handguns and 10 Mercedes Benzes without blinking. Will Dick Nixon say yes?
This was the last time anyone would be allowed to cold call the President.
In 90 minutes, King Dick takes you inside the Oval Office to present the most provocative piece of pop culture history you’ve never seen. It’s about our heroes, their true identities, and the only ones who can hurt them at their very core.
