<p>We are three Toronto-based dance artists who have come together after years of collaboration to premiere three contemporary dance works in a full-evening production entitled <em><strong>episodes </strong></em><strong>l</strong><em><strong> andscapes</strong>. </em>This DanceWorks CoWorks Series Event runs April 4-6, 2013 at the Dancemakers Centre for Creation in Toronto. The works explore themes of memory, locality and intimacy as we invite our audience to surrender to the dynamic terrains of the human experience. Our goal with this project is to challenge ourselves as artists while creating a visceral and lasting performance experience for our audience.</p>
<p>We are committed to the next generation of dance artists and audiences and will have matinees for high-school students with post-performance Q &amp; A's, as well as a variety of educational workshops as part of our community outreach.</p>

<h3>Starchild Dance Lindy Hop Project</h3>
<p>Greetings, my name is Traci Bartlow I and I LOVE to Lindy Hop!  I became intrigued with this dance when as a child my mother took me to the Black filmmakers Film Festival in Oakland, CA and we viewed dance and music films of the Harlem Renaissance. Since that time and through out my career as a dancer I learned and performed this form of authentic jazz dances.</p>
<p>As a dancer and choreographer I've had a great career and I'm proficent in many styles of including jazz, hip hop, and afircan dance. It all started with me learning funk and soul social dances in the 1970's, I trained professionally at the Alvin Ailey American Center in New York City and, I've worked in countless dance companies, productions, theater engagments, films and, video.  When I began teaching the history and culture of Hip Hop dance in the Bay Area more than 10 years ago, I've always included the Harlem Renaissance as a foundation of hip hop dance and culture.</p>
<p>My dance company Starchild Dance is seeking funding to support our Lindy Hop projects.  We are building a Lindy Hop inspired dance team and are creating a short film based on this work.  The funding from this campaign help will support: artist fees for training, creating new work and rehearsals, renting rehearsal space, and filmming our efforts to create a film short, ""Oakland is Hellzapoppin!""</p>
<p>Your contributions will help this dream manifest into a reality.  I have been teaching and perfoming Lindy Hop in Oakland for more than 10 years and I'm excited to give light to this beautiful community of artist and musicians.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
I actually need way more than $10,000 but I hope to secure this amount and also work on matching funds. This money will be used for artist fees; dancers, choreographers, directors, musicians, filmmaker and editor. What you get is a big shout out in our short film and, we have really cool Oakland is Hellzapoppin' T-shirts to give away. There are also free Lindy Hop classes with yours truly, ME! And, for the larger donors I will host a jazz and bbq luncheon in my beautiful backyard garden in West Oakland!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As a cultural worker my art and creativity is used to heal and empower my community serving as a vehicle for social change.  This this project will greatly impact the black community not only in Oakland but worldwide as we honor and celebrate an incredible dance that comes from the black experience.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p align=""left"">My daughter is a dancer. </p>
<p align=""left"">Kylie has been dancing since she was three years old.  She is now 13.  She is a beautiful and bright young lady.  She pays her way through her classes, as well as her younger sister’s classes, by assisting her teacher in other dance classes.  She has been doing this for two years now and she loves it.  She calls the little ones “my students” and takes pride in helping each and every one of them become a better dancer.</p>
<p align=""left"">Kylie has asked to attend the local JUMP Dance Convention coming up in April 2013.  She attended last year (which was her first year), but got sick on her last day and was unable to attend the workshops she signed up for.  She was devastated, as Mia Michaels’ class was one of the classes she missed.</p>
<p align=""left"">Kylie is an awesome kid and she works hard at everything she does.  We homeschool both of our daughters as this gives them the opportunity to learn and grow at their own pace, while being able to nurture their creative sides (Kylie also does karate and draws anime!). </p>
<p align=""left"">This year has been especially hard on our family in a number of ways.  In order for us to make the JUMP convention this coming year, we need your help.  Here is the breakdown of what we need:</p>
<p align=""left""><strong>JUMP Registration fee:</strong>  $205<br/><strong>JUMP Observer Fee: </strong> $40 (only one is needed)<br/> J<strong>UMP Hotel fee: </strong> $200 per night (x2)= $400<br/><strong>Gas:</strong>  $50<br/><strong>(1) JUMP Souvenir: </strong> $50<br/><strong>Parking:</strong>  $60<br/><strong>Food:</strong>  $400</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.accidentalshakespeare.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Accidental Shakespeare Company</a> is a new classical theater company in Chicago. The Accidentals want to bring a high level of dramaturgy and acting skills to an affordable storefront theater space. We are raising money for our first main stage show, The Tempest. We are raising the funds to cover the production costs so that we can maintain a very affordable ticket price for all.</p>
<p>The Tempest is a show about magic and most productions make the show about the magical stuff, the spectacle and the show. We like spectacle as much as anybody, but what makes our show unique is that we put the magic into the context it would have had in the early 17th century. Our design team has invented what we call “Alchemy Punk”: like Cyberpunk or Steampunk, but powered by wind and magic. So-called magicians, astrologers and alchemists were just discovering elementary physics, chemistry, astronomy, and navigation. Do not be confused by all the talk of spirits. Scholars of the natural world studied the supernatural with the same intensity. Fairies and elves and witches were believed to be every bit as much a part of the natural world as Mendel’s peas or Galileo’s stars. Furthermore, Christendom had been in flames for a century over issues of faith. Their culture, like ours, hovers on the brink of overwhelming change, and not all of those changes were good.</p>
<p> The Tempest touches on issues with such contemporary resonance that legislators in Arizona have banned the teaching of it in the public school system. They think the play is provocative. They are right.</p>
<p>We as a company are committed to low ticket costs, so that people who cannot afford the high ticket prices of many Chicago theaters will be able to come to our show. To achieve this goal, we need to raise the remaining third of our desired budget, $4,000. We could mount the production with the two thirds we have already raised, but currently our designers have very tight budgets, and are working with us for less than they can get in other productions.  The remaining $4,000 would ensure better stipends for our actors and designers, as well as fill out our designer's budgets.</p>
<p>remember any amount however small is a help us reach our goal and you will have our gratitude. The perks are suggested amounts only, but you can contribute any amount.</p>

To find a space for all of our Southern California dancers to come dance, learn, inspire, and create. At Boogiezone Utopia - Torrance, we encourage everyone to imagine what their ideal personal Utopian state of creative existence would be, and allow each to explore it further by not only providing the space, the but tools and the environment to help make dreams happen. Many dancers and artists have the vision to be exceptional, however, they do not have the resources to nurture it. We want to continue offering this resource to all aspiring dancers in the community, and truly believe that Boogiezone Utopia is the key to so many hopes and dreams!<br/><br/>Our goal is to continue with our vision to create this Utopian dance community. Our team has put in so much time, effort, and what we like to call ""sweat equity"" into this studio thus far. Now, we would like your help to bring us closer to our dream. <br/></span><br/></font></h3>

If we achieve this transformation process, we will be able to really foster the growth and development of young, aspiring and professional dancers. We have started something amazing, we just need a boost of support and help to continue on our journey. We know it will not happen over night, so we hope that in the next 60 days, we will be able to complete our goals and reach our vision.<br/><br/>If our campaign isn't successful, we may not get to truly see our vision come to life. At this moment, we have touched the surface of what we want to do with the studio, it is now, that we need to get under the surface to really bring out Boogiezone Utopia's true potential.

</div></div>","OUR STORY
It has always been a dream of ours to give Boogiezone - YOUR Online Dance Community Connection (Est. 2003) a physical home. To find a space for all of our Southern California dancers to come dance, learn, inspire, and create. At Boogiezone Utopia - Torrance, we encourage everyone to imagine what their ideal personal Utopian state of creative existence would be, and allow each to explore it further by not only providing the space, the but tools and the environment to help make dreams happen. Many dancers and artists have the vision to be exceptional, however, they do not have the resources to nurture it. We want to continue offering this resource to all aspiring dancers in the community, and truly believe that Boogiezone Utopia is the key to so many hopes and dreams!Our goal is to continue with our vision to create this Utopian dance community. Our team has put in so much time, effort, and what we like to call ""sweat equity"" into this studio thus far. Now, we would like your help to bring us closer to our dream. 
THE IMPACTWe have already started transforming the studio in Torrance to make it a welcoming and nurturing environment for all dancers in the area and from afar - we are global, with a massive reach. If we achieve this transformation process, we will be able to really foster the growth and development of young, aspiring and professional dancers. We have started something amazing, we just need a boost of support and help to continue on our journey. We know it will not happen over night, so we hope that in the next 60 days, we will be able to complete our goals and reach our vision.If our campaign isn't successful, we may not get to truly see our vision come to life. At this moment, we have touched the surface of what we want to do with the studio, it is now, that we need to get under the surface to really bring out Boogiezone Utopia's true potential. You can help us reach this potential. 
WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET
We need pledges and donations. Anything and everything helps! Any donation level is accepted!! We will definitely repay the favor. Our goal is to raise at least $2500 for studio equipment. To get quality speakers and proper air circulation installed in our 7 studios. All donations have incentives! These are just the base incentives as well!! We will be more than happy to cater to your needs for your donation!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hello, I'm Amanda 'Kat' Shaw also known as Whirling Tam Lin. I am a performance artist in the Genesee County area of Michigan. Recently my car was broken into and my performance tools were stolen. I'm starting this campaign so that I may replace them with something better and get back to work.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I love being able to go out ad perform on the streets of Flint. I like to believe that my being out there has inspired others to take the first step into a larger world. Whatever that world may be. I deeply love the world of performance art and and deeply hurt by the loss of my ability to go out and share my world with others. I seek to use some of these funds to make simple poi and start teaching others the joys and healing of flow.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>The first thing I'm going to do is replace my LED poi, my contact juggling ball and my Toroflux that were stolen from my car. After that all of the funds are going towards making some simple practice poi and renting a location to start teaching others in this area. I'm also looking into pulling in other instructors of other aspects of the performance arts. Even if I do not reach my full goal I'm going to be doing moving forward on this project.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Every person who makes a donation will receive a Thank you card with a promotional code good for a discount off anything from Unseelie Designs ( <a href=""http://www.etsy.com/shop/UnseelieDesigns"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.etsy.com/shop/UnseelieDesigns</a> ). </div>

<h1><strong>Hi. I'm Larissa Velez-Jackson,</strong></h1>
<p>Choreographer, theater-director and comedic dance provocateur. I'm also <strong>one of two Americans selected from 1023 applicants</strong> from all over the world for this year’s danceWeb Scholarship program in Vienna. This would be a dream come true for me: 5 weeks of intensive study of contemporary performance with the greatest artists from all over the world at <a href=""http://www.impulstanz.com/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ImPulsTanz</a>, Vienna International Dance Festival. To exchange ideas with global artists, teachers and a 1-on-1 artistic mentor at this level would be massively impactful on my career.  It is sure to be a life-changing experience and I'd like to share it with you! Here is what I plan to create as the fruits of my experience in Vienna:</p>
<h1><strong>LARISSA REPORTS ON IMPULSTANZ!</strong></h1>
<p>I will chronicle my time in residency in a special <a href=""http://larissareports.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Viennablog</a>, chock-full of photos, video, songs, movement scores, and notes from week-long intensive workshops (such as a <a href=""http://www.impulstanz.com/workshops11/wid108/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">writing workshop with Claudia LaRocco of The New York Times</a> and Voguing with the incredible<a href=""http://vimeo.com/22973254"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Archie Burnett</a>). Most importantly, I will <strong>broadcast a weekly video show</strong> on the Internet during my residency where I'll report on all the creative, exciting, unpredictable things that go on at this wonderful artist/residency/festival/extravaganza. I hope to interview art stars of the European dance world, as well as tell you all the behind-the-scenes tour jetes! As project backers, you'll have a stake in my process, with opportunities to make requests of my reporting, learn about and even ask questions of European dance celebrities at the festival. You’ll also get regular updates about my month-long experience and receive personalized thank-you's featured in the blog. I will literally be taking<strong><em> you all </em></strong>to Europe with me. I really need your contributions to get me there!!!!</p>
<div class=""template""> </div>
<h1>WHY RAISE $ IF I'VE ALREADY BEEN AWARDED THE SCHOLARSHIP???</h1>
<p>In order to participate in the program, I need<strong> </strong>to<strong> secure the co-funding</strong> of my scholarship. This 1/3 of the scholarship <strong>($2,850</strong>) needs to be provided <strong>by <em>June 1st, 2012</em>. </strong></p>
<p>Unlike European participants who get government funding<strong>, </strong>participants from America generally have to secure private donations from family, friends, and amazing supporters like<strong> you</strong>. In moments like these, I must look to my near and dear community to help make my dream come true!<strong> The upside</strong> is that with this IndiGoGo campaign, I'll be able to bring all of <em>you </em>with me on this exciting adventure!</p>
<div class=""template""> <strong></strong>
</div>
<div class=""template""><strong>BUDGET</strong></div>
<p><em>$2,850 -1/3 of the danceWEB program cost</em></p>
<p><em>$1050 - My meals for 5 weeks (not included in scholarship)</em></p>
<p><em>$3900 total</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Thanks for taking the time to listen and I hope that with your contribution I can be an ambassador (and happy troublemaker) from Newark, New Jersey, making awesome things happen in Vienna. </strong></em></p>

<div class=""template""> </div>
<p>Check out only some of the one-of-a-kind rewards donated by my favorite teachers and highly-esteemed colleagues for my project campaign.

<p><img alt=""childhood choreographic drawing of Larissa's "" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://larissavelez.com/dance.bmp"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></p></div>","Of her critically acclaimed solo evening at Danspace Project, The New York Times said “Ms. Velez-Jackson demonstrates her own formidable presence as she bursts into the space….A choreographer who is not afraid of being (or showing) ugly onstage, she disarms her audiences with humor...""

Hi. I'm Larissa Velez-Jackson,
Choreographer, theater-director and comedic dance provocateur. I'm also one of two Americans selected from 1023 applicants from all over the world for this year’s danceWeb Scholarship program in Vienna. This would be a dream come true for me: 5 weeks of intensive study of contemporary performance with the greatest artists from all over the world at ImPulsTanz, Vienna International Dance Festival. To exchange ideas with global artists, teachers and a 1-on-1 artistic mentor at this level would be massively impactful on my career.  It is sure to be a life-changing experience and I'd like to share it with you! Here is what I plan to create as the fruits of my experience in Vienna:
LARISSA REPORTS ON IMPULSTANZ!
I will chronicle my time in residency in a special Viennablog, chock-full of photos, video, songs, movement scores, and notes from week-long intensive workshops (such as a writing workshop with Claudia LaRocco of The New York Times and Voguing with the incredible Archie Burnett). Most importantly, I will broadcast a weekly video show on the Internet during my residency where I'll report on all the creative, exciting, unpredictable things that go on at this wonderful artist/residency/festival/extravaganza. I hope to interview art stars of the European dance world, as well as tell you all the behind-the-scenes tour jetes! As project backers, you'll have a stake in my process, with opportunities to make requests of my reporting, learn about and even ask questions of European dance celebrities at the festival. You’ll also get regular updates about my month-long experience and receive personalized thank-you's featured in the blog. I will literally be taking you all to Europe with me. I really need your contributions to get me there!!!!
 
WHY RAISE $ IF I'VE ALREADY BEEN AWARDED THE SCHOLARSHIP???
In order to participate in the program, I need to secure the co-funding of my scholarship. This 1/3 of the scholarship ($2,850) needs to be provided by June 1st, 2012. 
Unlike European participants who get government funding, participants from America generally have to secure private donations from family, friends, and amazing supporters like you. In moments like these, I must look to my near and dear community to help make my dream come true! The upside is that with this IndiGoGo campaign, I'll be able to bring all of you with me on this exciting adventure!
 

BUDGET
$2,850 -1/3 of the danceWEB program cost
$1050 - My meals for 5 weeks (not included in scholarship)
$3900 total
Thanks for taking the time to listen and I hope that with your contribution I can be an ambassador (and happy troublemaker) from Newark, New Jersey, making awesome things happen in Vienna. 



The Rewards for Giving!!!!

<strong>About ""How Deep Is the Ocean?""</strong>
<p>It's summer and the temperature's rising when suddenly every beach on the Jersey Shore is threatened with closure: The water is too polluted for swimming!  That is until Rob -- a small town pool technician -- stumbles upon an opportunity to chlorinate the ocean. But when a local handy man's lust for power and revenge threatens Rob's world, the two rivals are thrust into battle to restore the ocean and win the heart of  a woman they both love. A musical comedy about love, lust, and chlorine.</p>
<p>Despite the comedic overtones and unique premise, <strong>How Deep Is The Ocean?</strong> is a coming of age story about 3 people at a crossroads in their lives. It's a love triangle that explores the fears, regrets and excitement of finally having the chance to pursue a long lost dream. <strong>How Deep Is the Ocean? </strong>is funny, passionate and surprisingly realistic. </p>

<p><strong>Peter Cincotti (Music and Lyrics) </strong>singer-songwriter-pianist and native New Yorker, began playing piano at the age of three. By the age of 18 he was being called ""one of the most promising singer-pianists of the next generation"" by the New York Times.<br/><br/>In 2003, Peter's debut album, produced by the legendary Phil Ramone, reached #1 on the Billboard jazz charts, making Cincotti the youngest artist ever to do so. This led to acclaimed performances at Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, The Olympia in Paris, The Montreux Festival (where he won an award in their renowned piano competition), Queen Elizabeth Hall in London, and many other prestigious venues around the world.<br/><br/>Peter made his acting debut in the Kevin Spacey film Beyond The Sea, and also contributed to the film's soundtrack. He then made a cameo appearance in the blockbuster film Spider-Man 2. His original song ""December Boys"" was featured in the Australian film December Boys, starring Daniel Radcliffe.<br/><br/>In 2006, Cincotti teamed up with 14-time Grammy Award winner David Foster to record his first album of all original material for Warner Brothers Records entitled ""East Of Angel Town."" His single ""Goodbye Philadelphia"" took the airwaves by storm reaching the Top Ten on radio playlists throughout Europe, and in the Spring of 2009, Cincotti brought the album to the United States by joining the artist Seal on his sold out American tour.<br/><br/>Hailed as ""the rebirth of cool"" by Elle magazine, Peter explores musical styles that blend pop, rock, blues and jazz, infusing each new song he writes with originality and startling energy.

Our Story
Hi everyone, I'm Jason Seto, creator of Zwananani: The Musical and Founder/Artistic President of 3PM3AM Productions. www.3pm3amproductions.com
10 years ago, I traveled to South Africa, along with my friend, Bobby Gerongco, music producer, Kuya Productions and original leading cast members of Disney's, The Lion King on Broadway.  
At that time, I envisioned recording the beautiful South African harmonies and melodies I heard, while listening to Disney's, The Lion King and SARAFINA! albums, intertwined with commercial Pop/Rock/R&B rhythmic dance music. The vision was where ""Michael Jackson's History album, meets Disney's, The Lion King."" We ended up laying the recording foundation for the songs ""We Are One,"" and ""Zwananani."" A unique musical creation never combined before, to hit the commercial mainstream, pop audiences worldwide. 
""A dream to create a unique sound and UNITE people all across the world.""

Unfortunately, after recording the foundation and original ideas in South Africa, our team was hit with a life threatening car accident. While driving down a narrow road, a large truck came straight our way, not slowing down. In complete panic, the passenger tried to grab the driver’s wheel, causing our car to flip over numerous times, leaving us covered in each other's blood and near death.
Without knowing 10 years later, I see a story a few months ago on the National Geographic station, linking a study of the African indigenous tribes to our very own human existence through DNA testing, calling it ""We Are One."" 
 http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/06/0624_050624_spencerwells.html
I immediately rushed to our sound recordings and said, my god! This is our story! A story once a legend, now untold to the world.  
    ""A story linking the African indigenous tribes, to our very own human existence.""

Creative Development-Phase 1
To date, we have personally funded our musical sound recordings in South Africa and most recently, reproduced all of them. 
 At this time, we are in development of our script with our Hollywood book writer and musical Tony nominee-South African playwright. 
Our team would like to travel back to South Africa on research and script development. Once completed, we will be able to present our project to our celebrity and Broadway producer networks in January 2014.

The Impact
Our Tony Award and Grammy Nominee winning collaboration creative team players have produced some of the most successful musical works ever, having come out of South Africa, to reach the world. 
The creative team credits include Disney’s, The Lion Kings music world wide, SARAFINA! and book writer to the prequel of the world wide Hollywood film The Passion of Christ.
 Our musical title song “We Are One,” will have the power to UNITE cultures and people from across the world, linking our story of the African indigenous tribes, to our very own human existence.

<p><strong><em>How Cissy Crew, Wonder of the World, Of Grapes and Nuts</em> </strong>and <strong><em>Kvetch</em></strong> have been met with<em> Ovation Recommendations, LA Times Critic's Choice, </em>and more than a dozen other awards and nominations, prompting Stage Happenings to remark: <em><strong>""We wish SeaGlass would produce more often.  Once a year is not enough to see acting this vital.""</strong></em></p>
<p>We are thankful for the praise, and producing more often (in our own space) is just one of the many future goals we have set for ourselves.</p>

<p> </p></div>","Less than a week left!Help us fund our November 2012 production of A Christmas Twist!
Just four short years ago we founded SeaGlass Theatre.  We are now one of the most critically-acclaimed theatre companies in Los Angeles.  We’re pleased for you to join us in producing more of the live theater we all wish for in LA.
In November of 2012 - SeaGlass returns to the wonderful world of literary parody with A Christmas Twist - a delightfully disturbed dissing of Dickens, for everyone who finds the holidays a grueling experience.

How Cissy Crew, Wonder of the World, Of Grapes and Nuts and Kvetch have been met with Ovation Recommendations, LA Times Critic's Choice, and more than a dozen other awards and nominations, prompting Stage Happenings to remark: ""We wish SeaGlass would produce more often.  Once a year is not enough to see acting this vital.""
We are thankful for the praise, and producing more often (in our own space) is just one of the many future goals we have set for ourselves.

That's where you come in.  We are grateful for any contribution to help us meet our budgeting goal this year.  We've set up several perks and premiums to inspire you.
With your help we will be able to continue to bring live theatre to Los Angeles.
Many thanks from your friends at SeaGlass Theatre.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

Camp Needs Your Help!</b></u></h2>
<p>Improv Camp has earned its nickname of
the Best Camp Ever because it provides young adults with a safe, positive
environment where they can be themselves and learn from some of the best
improvisers North America has to offer. Campers gain confidence and skills that
apply not only to the stage, but to all aspects of everyday life. They also
forge lasting friendships that span the country and last a lifetime. This
strong community of improvisers allows Improv Camp to come back better every
year. </p>
<p>The Improv Camp’s wonderful staff have
donated thousands of dollars and willingly given much of their time and energy
to this project because they believe so strongly in it. Improv Camp has NEVER intended to make a profit because it continues to spend every dollar on the best facility,
trainers, food and activities for our campers. Every Improvcamper's experience is our top priority. </p>
<p>The fact is we are using the same equipment we have been since we started out camp in 2001. Old equipment that needs to be repaired regardless of how much duct tape you put on it. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We want to see the campers shine as brightly as they possibly can. In
order for this to happen we need a new lighting system! One that will fit into the environmentally friendly theme of our home Camp Fircom. These new LED lights will be
used for night time performances and fun activities that will make camp bigger
and brighter than ever before. This is where you come in! THIS IS YOUR TIME TO SHINE! </span></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435449788/ibkovi2bkjmnz6wpkfqx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>As multidisciplinary performers, Anne Goldberg and Martha Cargo strive 
to fuse their individual visions of groundbreaking art into an 
evening-length work encompassing the disciplines of dance, music, and 
visual art. Their unique backgrounds have brought them together, and The
 Field has named them Emerging Artists-in-Residence. To that end, Anne 
and Martha are seeking your support to help them pay the $550 course 
fee, which will enable them to attend regular workshops with visionary 
artists and work 6 hours of weekly rehearsal towards a final presentation at The 
Kitchen, long celebrated as a forum for interdisciplinary and 
progressive artistic projects in New York City.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By helping Anne and Martha financially, they will be able to benefit from rehearsal space, production costs, professional feedback and support from members of The Field.  In their development of an evening length performance in the spring, they look forward to benefiting from Emerging Artist workshops with peers and masters in the field of dance and music.  The process of developing new work is an exhilarating process, though it can be daunting when faced with the costs of production and fees.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise $550 for our tuition, which includes the cost of the Emerging Artist workshop series and production costs at the Kitchen, as well as all rehearsal space.  Any money raised over the 550 will be well spent on costuming, artist fees, and any other money will be put aside to book a venue for a full evening length performance.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>For our donors, we look to hold a short series of masterclasses and open rehearsals to show our progress.  We invite donors to take part in offering feedback on our project, and to participate in the creative process by attending our rehearsals on specified dates.  Finally, we wish to offer a masterclass open to all levels of experience, in which donors have the opportunity to work with Anne and Martha in an intimate, thought-provoking manner.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please share Anne and Martha's story with your friends and family to help spread the word!  Donations of any amount will be greatly appreciated, and will significantly boost both of Anne and Martha's careers.  By participating in the Field's residency, they will have many opportunities to share their work with top professionals in the industry and with the greater New York City community.<br/></p>

fee, which will enable them to attend regular workshops with visionary 
artists and work 6 hours of weekly rehearsal towards a final presentation at The 
Kitchen, long celebrated as a forum for interdisciplinary and 
progressive artistic projects in New York City.


The Impact
By helping Anne and Martha financially, they will be able to benefit from rehearsal space, production costs, professional feedback and support from members of The Field.  In their development of an evening length performance in the spring, they look forward to benefiting from Emerging Artist workshops with peers and masters in the field of dance and music.  The process of developing new work is an exhilarating process, though it can be daunting when faced with the costs of production and fees.  


What We Need & What You Get
We need to raise $550 for our tuition, which includes the cost of the Emerging Artist workshop series and production costs at the Kitchen, as well as all rehearsal space.  Any money raised over the 550 will be well spent on costuming, artist fees, and any other money will be put aside to book a venue for a full evening length performance.

For our donors, we look to hold a short series of masterclasses and open rehearsals to show our progress.  We invite donors to take part in offering feedback on our project, and to participate in the creative process by attending our rehearsals on specified dates.  Finally, we wish to offer a masterclass open to all levels of experience, in which donors have the opportunity to work with Anne and Martha in an intimate, thought-provoking manner.


Other Ways You Can Help
Please share Anne and Martha's story with your friends and family to help spread the word!  Donations of any amount will be greatly appreciated, and will significantly boost both of Anne and Martha's careers.  By participating in the Field's residency, they will have many opportunities to share their work with top professionals in the industry and with the greater New York City community.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Shhh Productions is pleased to announce their return to the Edmonton Fringe Festival with another wild and crazy show, SEZ SHE. Written to be performed by at least five actresses, the sequel to Jane Martin’s last monologue play with be tackled by only a duo of actors who will be reveling in virtues of brevity that include hilarity, surprise and homespun philosophy.

<p>The creators behind Shhh Productions, Lindsay Nelson and Sarah Wheeldon, began their journey at Grant MacEwan University in the early 2000s. After becoming good friends in swimming class -yes, swimming- they decided to start a company where they could produce shows at the Fringe about some of their many adventure travels. After the year 2004, Lindsay moved to Vancouver and Sarah to Calgary but they still managed to maintain their friendship and their mutual love for performing arts. AND SO, after a 9 year hiatus, they have overcome the challenges of 1000 KMs and the Rocky Mountain Range to collaborate on a project that is worthy of their efforts; encouraging creative collaboration across Western Canada.</p>

Carmen — her ghosts, her memories, her essence — haunts the group, and the laws of physics are bent as the remaining friends work through their suspicions, grief, anger, and sadness together to answer the question of How Carmen Died. As they slowly bring the truth to light, they must all reconcile what truly happened with their own version of reality.</p>

<h3>MUD by Maria Irene Fornes</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Hello link clickers! My name is Ellise and I am the director for Mud. I am currently a Senior Directing/Acting major at Pace University. I have been given the wonderful opportunity to direct MUD by Maria Irene Fornes, this January. I have the most exciting group of actors and designers (listed below) but now we need your help!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Director- Ellise Lesser</p>
<p>Assistant Director- Dana Greenfield, Dondre Stuetley</p>
<p>Stage Manager- Kelsey Lake</p>
<p>Lights Designer- David Shocket</p>
<p>Costume Designer- Matsy Stinson</p>

<p>Props Designer- Jesse James Keitel</p>

<p>Cast:</p>
<p>Mae-Maggie Allen</p>
<p>Lloyd-David Armanino</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Since this show is being set up in an educational setting, our budget is extremely minimal- that's where you come in! We need your help in order to sincerely reach our goals in this show. We are looking for your generousity to make our artistic vision come true!</p>
<p>Your money will be going to our set, lights, props, costumes, and sound purchases. I have the most wonderful designers, but in order for them to work the extent of their magic we need some extra support. This is why we are aiming for a total of $500; this cast and crew deserves every resource possible! The amount of talent on this project is ridiculous and we want to accentuate that!</p>
<p><br/>If we do not reach our goal, the money will still go towards the production- it is definitely happening- we would just like to supplement it as much as humanly possible. If we receive more than our goal (because you all rock) it will just increase what we are able to accomplish throughout this production!</p>
<p>Since we are based out of Pace, the main perk we can offer you in return is our undying love and gratitude. And tell you that you're pretty, because if you donate, you definitely are.</p>

A moonlit walk led by the Nature Center Staff is planned as an option after both performances.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Blue Moves has always operated on a modest budget, but there are some essential, significant expenses associated with producing a free show. If we do not reach our goal, we'll start cutting from the bottom of the list and work our way up. If we exceed our goal, we'll be able to fund a guest choreographer, a professional photo shoot and videography, and increase artists stipends.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary Blue Moves' full-length production for the season is ""Blue Terra,"" a free contemporary dance performance inspired by the theme Earth and performed on the grounds of Shelby Bottoms Nature Center Saturday, September 26th and Sunday, September 27th, 2015. The audience will be guided by a drummer to different sites in the area to watch earth-inspired dances performed on the grass. We're also collaborating with multi-media artists Camera Lucida from Louisville, Kentucky, and hope to include informational booths from local environmental groups, as well as performances by DancEast students. Choreography featured is by Holly Cannon Hesse, Sarah Marler, Valerie Hackworth, with a film by Amanda Cantrell Roche, and (hopefully) a guest choreographer. A moonlit walk led by the Nature Center Staff is planned as an option after both performances.   What We Need & What You Get Blue Moves has always operated on a modest budget, but there are some essential, significant expenses associated with producing a free show. If we do not reach our goal, we'll start cutting from the bottom of the list and work our way up. If we exceed our goal, we'll be able to fund a guest choreographer, a professional photo shoot and videography, and increase artists stipends.

Because Indiegogo fees are 4 % if you reach your goal and 9 % if you do not, we have set our fundraising goal at a bare minimum. However, there are other expenses we hope to cover in this campaign, and we hope you'll help us get there. An additional $400 would cover guest choreographer stipend and a professional photo shoot. An additional $1000 would allow us to pay for videography and more reasonable guest artist and graphic designer stipends.Please consider this donation tantamount to purchasing a ticket.

JUSTE DEBOUT UK has been created by CLARA BAJADO - Director (Director of INDAHOUSE Company) & VICKI IGBOKWE - Producer (Director of UCHENNA DANCE Company) in 2011.
An energetic female duet that really wanted to help UK Dance scene grow by providing a prestigious dance event as the JUSTE DEBOUT.
By having the JUSTE DEBOUT in the U.K we brought an international artistic exchange between dancers from all over the globe, and gave an amazing show to Non-Dancers, Dance lovers, music 'afficionados' and excitement seekers.
Since the 1st year, number of dancers registered and spectators has been growing, from 800 to more than 1000 spectators and dancers.

<p>Who are these gabby little ladies and why are they wedged,
unmoving, amid the furniture of this enormous mansion? Where is the rest of
their body? What could be hidden inside those purses that they’re clutching so
tightly? And who is feeding all these cats that we see traipsing around? Is it
really a mansion or some kind of institution? What is the deal with that man
who keeps visiting them at any odd time? How can they be so pretty and yet sing
so terribly out of tune? And, finally, what could possibly be the source of all
their self-confidence?</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Nine women from different age groups and backgrounds. Every
dawn, they wake up and every nightfall, they perish. Over and over again, with
dignity and awkwardness. Every one of their days is as a lifetime that must be
filled with activities to justify the Greatest of Questions: why do they dwell
in this world and what is their purpose? At their side, a single man attempts
to explain the inexplicable. He is caretaker, servant, observer... watching
them happily relish in the absurdity of their existence.</p>

<h3><b><i>Σύνοψη</i></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><i>Εννέα
γυναίκες διαφορετικών ηλικιών και
καταβολών κάθε πρωί ξυπνούν και κάθε
βράδυ πεθαίνουν. Ξανά και ξανά, με
αμηχανία και αξιοπρέπεια. Κάθε ημέρα
τους είναι σαν μια ολόκληρη ζωή που
πρέπει να γεμίσει από δραστηριότητες
που θα δικαιολογήσουν το πιο μεγάλο
ερωτηματικό: Γιατί βρίσκονται σε αυτόν
τον κόσμο και ποιος είναι ο σκοπός τους;
Δίπλα τους, ένας μοναδικός άντρας,
προσπαθεί να δώσει εξηγήσεις στο
ανεξήγητο. Παρατηρητής, επιστάτης και
υπηρέτης, τις παρακολουθεί να απολαμβάνουν
ευτυχισμένες το παράλογο της ύπαρξης.

<h3><b>Why do we think it’s important to
realize this project?</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p>
<p>We live in a time where the absurd prevails. Sometimes it seems
like we live in an institution which forces us to commit to its new terminology. All relationships need to be
redefined: social, political and, ultimately, existential. We all feel we
should get away from this situation, but at the end of the day we stay put,
 almost self-willingly. We live in total immovability and passively accept
everything that happens to us (with rare exceptions). What is the thing that
really drives us to this non-action? That is exactly what we aim to explore through
this production; it is why we consider it so important to make this project
materialize, through your contributions.</p>
<p>We are excited with the crowd funding process and especially
with your part in it. We firmly believe in the importance of making theatre in
Greece in this historic time, when
no funds are being channeled for the arts. Through this effort, we think we can
all help promote freedom of expression and support fresh, creative ideas individually
and collectively. Thus, these ideas may be able to reach their audience without
succumbing to this non-action that is being imposed on us. We see crowdfunding
as the future and consider it a creative process in itself. We think it is well
worth looking into what alternative funding has to offer. If you have not done
it before, you can always start with our production “Happy Days in Grey
Gardens” in Athens!</p>

<h3>What is “Grey Gardens”?</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The documentary “Grey Gardens” by the Maysles brothers was
filmed in the infamous “Grey Gardens” estate of the Bouvier family. This
masterpiece was at its time a tremendous style and fashion influencer, while it
later spawned both a Broadway musical and a fiction film starring Jessica Lange
and Drew Barrymore. “Grey Gardens” is the portrait of two rather eccentric
women: the 79 year old Edith Bouvier- Beale and her 56 year old daughter,
“LIttle” Edie, who were the aunt and cousin respectively of Jackie Kennedy -
Onassis. Both women lived secluded in their deserted mansion of 28 rooms,
infested with wild weeds, cats, fleas and raccoons. The camera lens invades
their most personal moments, captures their arguments, confessions of
unrequited love and unfulfilled dreams, and presents them as eternal teenagers
still swimming around in the faded grandeur of their long lost glory days.</p>
<p>The queer world of “Grey Gardens” (being particularly close to
Beckett’s universe) was a major source of inspiration for the development of
the characters of our play.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/63448/files/20130909124745-the-beales-of-grey-gardens-original.jpg?1378756065"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<h3><i>Τι είναι το “Grey Gardens”;</i></h3>
<p></p>
<p><i>Η ταινία-ντοκιμαντέρ «Grey Gardens» των αδελφών Maysles γυρίστηκε το 1975 στους ξακουστούς «Γκρίζους Κήπους» της οικογένειας Mπουβιέ. Το αριστουργηματικό αυτό φιλμ είχε τεράστια επιρροή στον κόσμο του στιλ και της μόδας και έγινε θεατρική παράσταση και ταινία με την Ντρού Μπάριμορ και την Τζέσικα Λανγκ. Το «Grey Gardens», είναι το πορτρέτο δύο εκκεντρικών γυναικών, της 79χρονης Ίντιθ Μπουβιέ Μπιλ και της 56χρονης κόρης της Ίντι, θείας και ξαδέρφης αντίστοιχα της Ζακλίν Κένεντι-Ωνάση, που ζουν απομονωμένες στην ερειπωμένη, 28 δωματίων, έπαυλή τους, μέσα στα αγριόχορτα, ανάμεσα σε γάτες, ψύλλους και ρακούν. Η κάμερα εισβάλλει στις πιο προσωπικές τους στιγμές, αποσπώντας αντιδικίες, εξομολογήσεις για αδιέξοδους έρωτες και ανεκπλήρωτα όνειρα, παρουσιάζοντάς τες ως αιώνιες<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> έφηβες, βυθισμένες στα περασμένα τους μεγαλεία. </span></i></p>
<p><i>Ο παράδοξος κόσμος του “Grey Gardens”, τόσο κοντινός στο πνεύμα του Μπέκετ, αποτέλεσε βασική πηγή έμπνευσης για την ανάπτυξη των χαρακτήρων του έργου μας.</i></p>

<h3>What is “Happy Days”?</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>“Happy Days” by Samuel
Beckett is considered one of the masterpieces of modern theatre and one of the
most emblematic plays of the theatre of the absurd. In “Happy Days” nothing
ever changes. Movement is immobility. Absence is action. Time is frozen and
space is isolated. Human existence vibrates not with the conflict of passions
or events, but in the absence of those. </p>
<p>Winnie is looking for a kind gesture, an answer to her
questions. She is sitting still atop her deserted hill. Abandoned, she screams
a whisper for help. The tragic twist: the abandonment is dwelling inside her
and her invocation for help is but to herself.</p>
<p>At no point did we ever contemplate to adapt such an
accomplished and well made play as “Happy Days”. We instead took inspiration
from the philosophy and questioning in Beckett’s work -and this play in
particular- allowing them to permeate the essence of our production.</p>

<p></p>
<h3><i>Τι είναι οι “ευτυχισμένες μέρες”;</i></h3>
<p></p>
<p><i>Οι “Ευτυχισμένες μέρες” του Samuel Becket θεωρείται ένα από τα αριστουργήματα του σύγχρονου θεάτρου και ένα από τα πιο εμβληματικά έργα του θεάτρου του παραλόγου. Στις «ευτυχισμένες μέρες» τίποτα δεν αλλάζει. Η κίνηση είναι  ακινησία. Η απουσία είναι δράση. Ο χρόνος είναι παγωμένος και ο χώρος είναι απομονωμένος. Η ανθρώπινη ύπαρξη πάλλεται, όχι σε συγκρούσεις παθών και γεγονότων, αλλά στην απουσία αυτών. </i></p>
<p><i>Η Ουίννυ ψάχνει μια τρυφερή χειρονομία, μια απάντηση στις ερωτήσεις της. Είναι ακίνητη στον έρημο λόφο. Εγκαταλελειμμένη, ουρλιάζει ψιθυριστά για βοήθεια. Με την τραγική διαφορά ότι η εγκατάλειψη βρίσκεται μέσα της, και η επίκληση είναι προς τον εαυτό της.</i></p>
<p><i>Σε καμία περίπτωση δεν θελήσαμε να διασκευάσουμε ένα τόσο ολοκληρωμένο έργο σαν αυτό. Όμως η φιλοσοφία και τα ερωτήματα που βρίσκονται στο σύνολο του έργου του Μπέκετ και ειδικότερα οι “Ευτυχισμένες μέρες”  διατρέχουν το πνεύμα της παράστασης μας.</i></p>

Ποιες είναι αυτές οι λαλίστατες γυναίκες που στέκονται έτσι ακίνητες και σφηνωμένες; Που βρίσκεται το υπόλοιπο σώμα τους; Τι κρύβουν στις τσάντες τους και τις κρατούν τόσο σφιχτά; Κι αυτές οι γάτες που κυκλοφορούν στο χώρο από ποιον άραγε να ταΐζονται  Πρόκειται για έπαυλη ή μήπως είναι κάποιο ίδρυμα; Τι ρόλο παίζει αυτός ο άνδρας που τις επισκέπτεται τόσο συχνά; Πως είναι δυνατόν να είναι τόσο όμορφες και να τραγουδούν τόσο παράφωνα;  Και από που αντλούν, επιτέλους, τόση αυτοπεποίθηση;

Summary


Nine women from different age groups and backgrounds. Every
dawn, they wake up and every nightfall, they perish. Over and over again, with
dignity and awkwardness. Every one of their days is as a lifetime that must be
filled with activities to justify the Greatest of Questions: why do they dwell
in this world and what is their purpose? At their side, a single man attempts
to explain the inexplicable. He is caretaker, servant, observer... watching
them happily relish in the absurdity of their existence.

Σύνοψη

Εννέα
γυναίκες διαφορετικών ηλικιών και
καταβολών κάθε πρωί ξυπνούν και κάθε
βράδυ πεθαίνουν. Ξανά και ξανά, με
αμηχανία και αξιοπρέπεια. Κάθε ημέρα
τους είναι σαν μια ολόκληρη ζωή που
πρέπει να γεμίσει από δραστηριότητες
που θα δικαιολογήσουν το πιο μεγάλο
ερωτηματικό: Γιατί βρίσκονται σε αυτόν
τον κόσμο και ποιος είναι ο σκοπός τους;
Δίπλα τους, ένας μοναδικός άντρας,
προσπαθεί να δώσει εξηγήσεις στο
ανεξήγητο. Παρατηρητής, επιστάτης και
υπηρέτης, τις παρακολουθεί να απολαμβάνουν
ευτυχισμένες το παράλογο της ύπαρξης.

Why do we think it’s important to
realize this project?


We live in a time where the absurd prevails. Sometimes it seems
like we live in an institution which forces us to commit to its new terminology. All relationships need to be
redefined: social, political and, ultimately, existential. We all feel we
should get away from this situation, but at the end of the day we stay put,
 almost self-willingly. We live in total immovability and passively accept
everything that happens to us (with rare exceptions). What is the thing that
really drives us to this non-action? That is exactly what we aim to explore through
this production; it is why we consider it so important to make this project
materialize, through your contributions.
We are excited with the crowd funding process and especially
with your part in it. We firmly believe in the importance of making theatre in
Greece in this historic time, when
no funds are being channeled for the arts. Through this effort, we think we can
all help promote freedom of expression and support fresh, creative ideas individually
and collectively. Thus, these ideas may be able to reach their audience without
succumbing to this non-action that is being imposed on us. We see crowdfunding
as the future and consider it a creative process in itself. We think it is well
worth looking into what alternative funding has to offer. If you have not done
it before, you can always start with our production “Happy Days in Grey
Gardens” in Athens!


Γιατί πιστεύουμε ότι είναι σημαντική η υλοποίηση
του;


Ζούμε
σε μια εποχή όπου το παράλογο κυριαρχεί.
Μοιάζει σαν να ζούμε σε ένα  ίδρυμα το
οποίο μας αναγκάζει να μάθουμε την νέα
ορολογία του με την οποία μέχρι πριν
μερικά χρόνια δεν είχαμε καμία σχέση.
Οι σχέσεις επαναπροσδιορίζονται.
Κοινωνικές, πολιτικές και τελικά
υπαρξιακές. Από αυτό το περιβάλλον θα
θέλαμε να ξεφύγουμε αλλά τελικά σχεδόν
οικειοθελώς παραμένουμε. Βρισκόμαστε
σε πλήρη ακινησία και δεχόμαστε παθητικά
όσα μας συμβαίνουν πλην ελάχιστων
εξαιρέσεων.  Τι είναι αυτό που μας οδηγεί
στην μη δράση; Αυτό προσπαθούμε να
διερευνήσουμε μέσα στην παράσταση αυτή
και γι αυτό θεωρούμε σημαντικό να γίνει
πραγματικότητα με την δική σας συμμετοχή.






Είμαστε
ενθουσιασμένοι και με τον τρόπο που θα
συγκεντρώσουμε τα χρήματα για να πάρει
σάρκα και οστά αυτή η παράσταση και
συγκεκριμένα με την βοήθειά σας, γιατί
είναι σημαντικό να υλοποιούνται
παραστάσεις σήμερα που δεν δίνονται
πια  χρήματα για τον πολιτισμό. Με αυτόν
τον τρόπο βοηθάμε στην ελευθερία της
έκφρασης και στηρίζουμε εμείς οι ίδιοι
φρέσκες, δημιουργικές ιδέες να φτάσουν
στο κοινό τους, χωρίς να είμαστε
αναγκασμένοι να υποκύπτουν στην
ακινησία που μας επιβάλουν. Γιατί είναι
πιο δημιουργική διαδικασία και θεωρούμε
ότι είναι το μέλλον. Αξίζει να εξερευνήσετε
την εναλλακτική χρηματοδότηση !  Αν δεν
το έχετε ξανακάνει, ξεκινήστε μαζί μας!

infested with wild weeds, cats, fleas and raccoons. The camera lens invades
their most personal moments, captures their arguments, confessions of
unrequited love and unfulfilled dreams, and presents them as eternal teenagers
still swimming around in the faded grandeur of their long lost glory days.
The queer world of “Grey Gardens” (being particularly close to
Beckett’s universe) was a major source of inspiration for the development of
the characters of our play.


Τι είναι το “Grey Gardens”;

Η ταινία-ντοκιμαντέρ «Grey Gardens» των αδελφών Maysles γυρίστηκε το 1975 στους ξακουστούς «Γκρίζους Κήπους» της οικογένειας Mπουβιέ. Το αριστουργηματικό αυτό φιλμ είχε τεράστια επιρροή στον κόσμο του στιλ και της μόδας και έγινε θεατρική παράσταση και ταινία με την Ντρού Μπάριμορ και την Τζέσικα Λανγκ. Το «Grey Gardens», είναι το πορτρέτο δύο εκκεντρικών γυναικών, της 79χρονης Ίντιθ Μπουβιέ Μπιλ και της 56χρονης κόρης της Ίντι, θείας και ξαδέρφης αντίστοιχα της Ζακλίν Κένεντι-Ωνάση, που ζουν απομονωμένες στην ερειπωμένη, 28 δωματίων, έπαυλή τους, μέσα στα αγριόχορτα, ανάμεσα σε γάτες, ψύλλους και ρακούν. Η κάμερα εισβάλλει στις πιο προσωπικές τους στιγμές, αποσπώντας αντιδικίες, εξομολογήσεις για αδιέξοδους έρωτες και ανεκπλήρωτα όνειρα, παρουσιάζοντάς τες ως αιώνιες έφηβες, βυθισμένες στα περασμένα τους μεγαλεία. 
Ο παράδοξος κόσμος του “Grey Gardens”, τόσο κοντινός στο πνεύμα του Μπέκετ, αποτέλεσε βασική πηγή έμπνευσης για την ανάπτυξη των χαρακτήρων του έργου μας.

                                              



What is “Happy Days”?


“Happy Days” by Samuel
Beckett is considered one of the masterpieces of modern theatre and one of the
most emblematic plays of the theatre of the absurd. In “Happy Days” nothing
ever changes. Movement is immobility. Absence is action. Time is frozen and
space is isolated. Human existence vibrates not with the conflict of passions
or events, but in the absence of those. 
Winnie is looking for a kind gesture, an answer to her
questions. She is sitting still atop her deserted hill. Abandoned, she screams
a whisper for help. The tragic twist: the abandonment is dwelling inside her
and her invocation for help is but to herself.
At no point did we ever contemplate to adapt such an
accomplished and well made play as “Happy Days”. We instead took inspiration
from the philosophy and questioning in Beckett’s work -and this play in
particular- allowing them to permeate the essence of our production.


                                

Τι είναι οι “ευτυχισμένες μέρες”;

Οι “Ευτυχισμένες μέρες” του Samuel Becket θεωρείται ένα από τα αριστουργήματα του σύγχρονου θεάτρου και ένα από τα πιο εμβληματικά έργα του θεάτρου του παραλόγου. Στις «ευτυχισμένες μέρες» τίποτα δεν αλλάζει. Η κίνηση είναι  ακινησία. Η απουσία είναι δράση. Ο χρόνος είναι παγωμένος και ο χώρος είναι απομονωμένος. Η ανθρώπινη ύπαρξη πάλλεται, όχι σε συγκρούσεις παθών και γεγονότων, αλλά στην απουσία αυτών. 
Η Ουίννυ ψάχνει μια τρυφερή χειρονομία, μια απάντηση στις ερωτήσεις της. Είναι ακίνητη στον έρημο λόφο. Εγκαταλελειμμένη, ουρλιάζει ψιθυριστά για βοήθεια. Με την τραγική διαφορά ότι η εγκατάλειψη βρίσκεται μέσα της, και η επίκληση είναι προς τον εαυτό της.
Σε καμία περίπτωση δεν θελήσαμε να διασκευάσουμε ένα τόσο ολοκληρωμένο έργο σαν αυτό. Όμως η φιλοσοφία και τα ερωτήματα που βρίσκονται στο σύνολο του έργου του Μπέκετ και ειδικότερα οι “Ευτυχισμένες μέρες”  διατρέχουν το πνεύμα της παράστασης μας.

</h3>We are a group of local actors from Winnipeg Manitoba in Canada who have been selected to produce and perform the 2006 OBIE AWARD WINNING PLAY, ""The Thugs"" by Adam Bock, at the 2016 Winnipeg Fringe Theatre Festival  in July.<br/><br/>""The Thugs"" is a quick paced, dark comedy about a group of temps working at a law firm who try to discover the truth about rumours of people who suddenly go missing at their law firm.  It is a great play with complex, funny characters and a female central cast at the heart of the story, which is why we are very excited about the production.<br/><br/><h3>What we need:<br/>
</h3>We would like to reach out to you, in hopes to raise $1800 in order to help with production costs for our production.  With your help, funding for our project will help with the payment of:<br/><br/>Festival Venue and production fee - $750.00<br/>Licensing and rights for the play - $750.00<br/>Props, Costumes, Advertising (Posters &amp; Handbills) - $300.00<br/>**Any additional money raised will go toward the production value of our play**<br/><br/>
</div><div> <h3>Your Impact With Your Donation:<br/>
</h3> <p>As a local community theatre group, the biggest obstacle preventing local production companies from making any project is....money.  The average cost for any production company to be in the Fringe can cost anywhere from $1500 - $3000 depending on the nature of their production.  With your help we can put on a production that we are absolutely passionate about.  The money we are asking for is the bare minimum we require to get the play off the ground.  <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges:</h3>
<p>This is our company's first crowd funding pitch.  Perhaps our biggest risk for our campaign is simply that we do not know many people as we are a new production group.  We just hope that our passion for this project comes through in our pitch and video.  We are not sure if this will work or if we will raise any money, but we are willing to give crowd funding a try and raise any kind of money for financial relief for our show.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are in a fantastic venue this year and have great showtimes 
and we feel that we are in a great position to get a great audience turn
 out for all our shows.  With your help, we can put on the best show 
possible and give the audience the best Fringe theatre experience 
possible.  </p>We would love for everyone who comes across this pitch to kindly spread the word about our campaign and give whatever they can and help a bunch of local actors give the city of Winnipeg a great show for the festival.<br/> </div></div>","Our Project:

<h3>What's the Project?</h3>
<p>""Scar Tissue"" is a new play still in the development stages. We've had a staged reading in July 2017, and we are now focussed on developing the play further by way of rehearsals with a creative and a cast of actors over the next 4 weeks. This will culminate in a one night only performance. This performance is our chance to take the project to the next level, to invite many theatre professionals who may want to pick up the play for a full run.</p>
<h3>Why now?</h3>
<p>""Scar Tissue"" has already had a profound effect on those who have read it or seen the staged reading in July. So many people have told us ""That's happened to me."" ""That's happened to my friend."" ""That's happened to my sister."" ""That's happened to my daughter."" Then the #MeToo movement happened. With so many women coming forward and sharing their experiences, we too, want to share our voice and continue this integral conversation.</p>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>Time does not heal all wounds. Best friends Jessica and Sam each have scars from their pasts that have never quite healed. Jessica has never been able to get passed an extremely damaging romantic relationship from her formative years in college, while Sam has been ignoring a painfully fractured relationship with her sister. After years of denial, they are both forced to confront these wounds head on. The only way they can begin to heal is to face what they didn't want to see - and they cannot do that without each other.</p>
<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>We're an all-female creative team!</p>
<p>Victoria Fragnito, Playwright/Producer:  Victoria is an actor/director turned playwright based out of NYC. When she moved to the city to pursue her acting career, she began looking for roles she could use in a footage reel. That proved much more difficult than she thought, as creative, complex, and interesting roles for women were few and far between. She decided to create her own. She began writing a scene that would eventually turn into the full length ""Scar Tissue"".</p>
<p>Francesca Di Cesare, Director/Producer: Francesca has been directing in NYC for 5 years. Originally from the U.K. she's passionate about new works, and in particular this project. Francesca directed the staged reading of ""Scar Tissue"" in July, and her partnership with Victoria developed along with the play! She believes completely in the power and strength of women, and wants to highlight that within this piece.</p>
<p>Kristin Ciccone Gole, Dramaturg: Kristin is a storyteller at heart. She's been writing and performing in Philadelphia and New York City since 2008. She has worked as a developmental editor since 2010, helping writers find their voice during the revision process. She holds a BA with Honors in Theatre from Drew University and a Masters in Journalism from Columbia. She is currently a digital content editor and producer at Spotify. She is excited to bring this important story to life.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>New plays take time to form. We need your support in order to develop the script and the characters further with a team of artists. We are asking for $3,000 to help us fund this development process, culminating in a one night only performance. Here are the specifics of where your donation will be going:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Rehearsal Space-</strong> I'm not sure you've heard, but New York City can be pricey. Rehearsal space will cost us an average of $20/hour, and that is on the low side of things! At 4 hours of rehearsal, 4 times a week, it begins to add up FAST!</li>
<li>
<strong>Pay Our People- </strong>It is extremely important to us that we pay the wonderful creative artists that have dedicated their time and talent to make this the best possible representation of <i>Scar Tissue</i>. We value them as artists and we want to show them that we value them. </li>
<li>
<strong>Marketing- </strong>We need to get the word out! We want anyone and everyone to hear this story. To do that we need certain marketing materials; postcards, posters, paid ads on social media etc.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't donate, no worries! You can still help us spread the word. Share our campaign on: Facebook, Instagram, twitter. Email your friends, family, co-workers. This is a play that shares OUR voice, and to do that, we need YOUR voices.</p>
<p>Thank you all for your love and support!</p>

This performance is our chance to take the project to the next level, to invite many theatre professionals who may want to pick up the play for a full run.
Why now?
""Scar Tissue"" has already had a profound effect on those who have read it or seen the staged reading in July. So many people have told us ""That's happened to me."" ""That's happened to my friend."" ""That's happened to my sister."" ""That's happened to my daughter."" Then the #MeToo movement happened. With so many women coming forward and sharing their experiences, we too, want to share our voice and continue this integral conversation.
Synopsis
Time does not heal all wounds. Best friends Jessica and Sam each have scars from their pasts that have never quite healed. Jessica has never been able to get passed an extremely damaging romantic relationship from her formative years in college, while Sam has been ignoring a painfully fractured relationship with her sister. After years of denial, they are both forced to confront these wounds head on. The only way they can begin to heal is to face what they didn't want to see - and they cannot do that without each other.
Who We Are
We're an all-female creative team!
Victoria Fragnito, Playwright/Producer:  Victoria is an actor/director turned playwright based out of NYC. When she moved to the city to pursue her acting career, she began looking for roles she could use in a footage reel. That proved much more difficult than she thought, as creative, complex, and interesting roles for women were few and far between. She decided to create her own. She began writing a scene that would eventually turn into the full length ""Scar Tissue"".
Francesca Di Cesare, Director/Producer: Francesca has been directing in NYC for 5 years. Originally from the U.K. she's passionate about new works, and in particular this project. Francesca directed the staged reading of ""Scar Tissue"" in July, and her partnership with Victoria developed along with the play! She believes completely in the power and strength of women, and wants to highlight that within this piece.
Kristin Ciccone Gole, Dramaturg: Kristin is a storyteller at heart. She's been writing and performing in Philadelphia and New York City since 2008. She has worked as a developmental editor since 2010, helping writers find their voice during the revision process. She holds a BA with Honors in Theatre from Drew University and a Masters in Journalism from Columbia. She is currently a digital content editor and producer at Spotify. She is excited to bring this important story to life.

What We Need
New plays take time to form. We need your support in order to develop the script and the characters further with a team of artists. We are asking for $3,000 to help us fund this development process, culminating in a one night only performance. Here are the specifics of where your donation will be going:


Rehearsal Space- I'm not sure you've heard, but New York City can be pricey. Rehearsal space will cost us an average of $20/hour, and that is on the low side of things! At 4 hours of rehearsal, 4 times a week, it begins to add up FAST!

Pay Our People- It is extremely important to us that we pay the wonderful creative artists that have dedicated their time and talent to make this the best possible representation of Scar Tissue. We value them as artists and we want to show them that we value them. 

Marketing- We need to get the word out! We want anyone and everyone to hear this story. To do that we need certain marketing materials; postcards, posters, paid ads on social media etc.


Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't donate, no worries! You can still help us spread the word. Share our campaign on: Facebook, Instagram, twitter. Email your friends, family, co-workers. This is a play that shares OUR voice, and to do that, we need YOUR voices.
Thank you all for your love and support!

<h2>El Teatro Campesino</h2>
<p>Founded in 1965 by American playwright Luis Valdez as a means of organizing the nation’s agricultural workers through art and culture, El Teatro Campesino - literally “the Farm Workers’ theater” - has been at the forefront of using theater as an artistic generator of social change for five decades. ETC’s seminal work has impacted and influenced several artists and cultural institutions in developing an acting technique, aesthetic, and narrative of Latinos’ pursuit of social justice in the United States and internationally. From flat bed trucks to the Broadway stage, this multigenerational company has worked to empower Chicano/Latino artists and communities from its home in San Juan Bautista, California since 1971.</p>

<h3>Producer(s) Bio</h3>
<p>Samantha Demboski and Gary Stensland have been a part of the improv and sketch comedy scenes in Seattle for the past five years. They met at Gonzaga University, where Gary graduated with degrees in math and music composition, and Samantha studied theater and--while she didn't leave with the piece of paper--learned a lot about herself. Together, they form the production duo Who Dat Cindy and are two of the founding members of sketch and improv group Fifty Percent Less Bear. Separately, Gary recently appeared in the cabaret-drag-rock n' roll-monster-inspired-romp ""The New Improvised Musical"" at Jet City Improv and has been gigging around Seattle with his guitar and angelic voice for the past five years. Samantha is also a founding member of the sketch group BEEF!, the creator and producer of NASTY Improv, has previously performed in the karaoke-night-improv-spectacular Empty Orchestra at Jet City Improv, and is the creator/host of the podcast Here's What You Don't Do.</p>
<h3>What Is This Darn Show, Anyway?</h3>
<p>Fauku and Jeremy are two self-proclaimed ""geniuses,"" who--despite lacking subtlety, teamwork, social skills, sincerity, mental stability, and any semblance of success--believe themselves to be burgeoning gods of performance art. It's only when a new enclave of fellow artists has them confronting their own dysfunctional motivations that they're forced to examine the lives they've chosen to lead.</p>
<p>Along with writing and directing, Samantha and Gary take on the roles of Fauku and Jeremy, describing them as ""the worst versions of ourselves--but worse."" This dig into the muddy well of mental health combined with the undefinable nature of performance art as a medium forms a narrative of six real people making highly unreal things with very real consequences.</p>
<p>Unlike most musicals, every song in This Is My Dinner is a performance given by the characters within it. As a result, each song is accompanied by the cast (guitar, keyboard, violin, triangle, trash-can, hitting stuff) and showcases their personal aesthetic as performers and artists. What they choose (and don't choose) to say and the style of the song says as much about the characters as it does about the narrative.</p>
<p>First performed as a twenty-five minute musical revue in 2016, a revised and expanded hour-long version of the show was produced at the Seattle Fringe Festival in 2017; this upcoming, full-length production in August at 12th Ave Arts in Seattle represents the culmination of years of writing and re-writing, self-examination as people and artists, and a whole lot of love for these severely messed up people in their messed up world.</p>

<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>My name is Adina Taubman. I am an actor, a playwright, a teacher, and a gun violence prevention activist.</p>
<p>There have been over 250 school shootings since the Columbine massacre in 1999. This is a national epidemic and our new normal.</p>
<p>Since the election of our new president, there has been an increase in bullying amongst young people, and with Betsy DeVos as our new Secretary of Education, it's possible that soon legislation will be introduced to allow guns in our schools.</p>
<p>It's more important than ever to keep our children safe.</p>
<p>I became a gun violence prevention activist shortly after Columbine.</p>
<p>When I had my first child in 2005, the need to help make our schools and communities safer became one of my top priorities. So, I began performing <i>A Line In The Sand</i> in high schools, with the goal of creating a dialogue for students about how they can create a more compassionate school community.</p>
<p>After more than 10 years of performing for students and listening to them talk about their experiences, I have experienced firsthand the unique power of theater  to create empathy and to inspire positive action. I have seen students make connections with each other and open their minds to new ways of thinking.</p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign, you will help five New York City high schools, who lack the funding to do so, bring A LINE IN THE SAND to their students. </p>
<p><i>You </i>will give these students the opportunity to begin to heal their school communities. </p>
<p><i>You </i>will give them the opportunity to learn how to write a play about their experiences and to learn basic performance skills, by participating in a 10 session writing and performance workshop that I offer.</p>
<p>Most importantly, <i>you</i> will help them to <strong>find their voice</strong> and share it with their classmates and teachers.</p>
<div><h3><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3></div>
<p>I need to raise $5,000 to bring A LINE IN THE SAND to five New York City high schools, which covers my $1,000 fee, per school, to perform the play, lead a post show discussion with the students, and teach the writing and performance workshop. </p>

As a young female artist, I am always dedicated to supporting young female dancers and choreographers, and have continuously been drawn to creative projects that focus on the female experience.</p><h3>Wait a second...this campaign is already fully funded...</h3><p>You are absolutely correct!  I am incredibly humbled and so ridiculously excited to say that in just under two weeks, we met our campaign goal of $3700.  THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU to everyone who has contributed!  Being that we are a group of ambitious, driven boss-ladies, we thought, ""why stop there?""  And so... we have officially unofficially set a <strong>STRETCH GOAL of $5000</strong>.  Our initial goal of $3700 covers all production costs associated with this project, all of which you can read about in the original campaign description below.  <i>These funds do not support the dance makers and dance performers involved in this project.</i>  <strong>I am now hoping to raise an additional $1300 as a base stipend for the choreographers showcasing work in this show. </strong> Often the last paycheck cut, dancers are notoriously underpaid for their work.  The average dancer and choreographer works for as little as <i><strong>$0.50/hour</strong></i>.  In a world where women are already paid less than their worth on average, I think we should do everything we can to pay these artists an adequate stipend.  It is extremely important to me to demonstrate the value of these dance artists as fully as I can, and I hope you will help me to do so.  To learn more about this project, please continue to read our original campaign description below, and please consider making a contribution to this production.  You will be supporting a dedicated group of female dance artists, as well as joining a movement standing up for the voices of women in the arts, and women in the world at large.</p><p>---</p><h3><strong>What is ""...that's what she said""?</strong></h3><p><strong>“…that’s what she said”</strong> will be a theater production focused on the concept of womanhood.

Ok, I’m up to date about the money. Why is “… that’s what she said” so important? Why should I invest in this?
Simply put, this project makes dance happen, and will make dance happen after this show is complete. Dance can inspire perspective. Dance can tell a story. Dance can inspire discussion.
This show will address womanhood, something that (despite the media focus of late) is still never discussed, appreciated, or acknowledged enough.
This show offers the female perspective from diverse female lenses.
This show could resonate with the audience, and inspire discussion. It could even inspire in someone (or many people) the dedication to change and action.
Female dancers and choreographers receive fewer opportunities than their male counterparts. I’d like to change that.
The show will foster a community of female artists who support and nurture each other in the pursuit to create high quality art, examining the female experience. #girlpower, am I right?
The more people that see our show, and support our cause, the more we multiply our community of support for female choreographers and dancers AND the need to hear the female voice and perspective in art.
I will be providing, free, to choreographers:


Promotional material (videography and photography), which supports artists in the future with their own funding, education or grant endeavors
and development opportunities
This support will help the artists involved continue to produce more art, and in even better form than before.Vincent van Gogh once said, “What is done in love is well done.” I am doing this from a place of deep, deep love, and I will do everything I can do it well. I’m feeling inspired… but pretty broke. How can I still help?I totally get it!

<p>For your contribution of $200, you will receive a multi-season pass and one other person, along with an artisinal shadow-puppet-in-a-jar. It is <i>so</i> worth it!</p>
<p>For your contribution of $500, you will receive a multi-season pass for you and one other person, along with an artisinal shadow-puppet-in-a-jar AND a song written for you and recorded by Charlotte Moroz. This is one of the best ideas you've ever had!</p>

<p><strong>Why have we started this campaign?</strong> <br/>Leigh, Dan, and I are passionate about creating new work, in a world that needs, frankly, new ideas, new hopefulness, new struggles with the meaning of life, new ways of telling our old stories.

Dan is a stage manager of colossal proportions, working primarily with <i>Punchdrunk's Sleep No More</i>, a dramaturg, a logistician, an equal visionary. He kicks butt and coordinates the impossible. Charlotte is a puppet-maker (working with the majestic Puppet Kitchen) , a music-maker, a writer, a performer, a clown and improviser. Charlotte brings fresh show ideas and baby scripts to Dan and Leigh, and they all wade through the unknown and new together.

What a deal! We are committed to making beautiful and truthful new live theater, the kind that makes you think how cool it is to be a human being. By funding this project, you are saying YES to independent, real and flawed human beings. YES to nurturing the creative independence and vision of young artists. YES to good music, music that doesn't sound like a robot wrote it. YES to original stories. <br/><br/><strong>CHALLENGES</strong><br/>We wish to convey our sincerity to you via our choosing a project and goal that is a stretch for us and yet very attainable. This is not a safe goal to go after, per say, because we want to grow and expand through this experience. Anyone who makes theater knows that we are setting out on a very modest budget to develop 4 shows, but we want to give you something special, something heartfelt, and we want to give you as much as possible this year. This means making FOUR NEW SHOWS for you this year, a goal that allows us to make things with quality and love and also with frequency. Producing one new show every 3 months will be a big feat to pull off, but we have reservations with a performance space for each show date, and a team around us to keep us on schedule.<br/><br/><strong>HOW TO HELP?</strong><br/>While contribution is of course a wonderful way to build this new theater endeavor with us, there are so many other ways you can join in the fun. We are so grateful to you for getting the word out, for emailing friends, colleagues, and family, and for all your good vibes, juju, and encouragement. If purchasing tickets presents any hardship for you, please be in touch. We'll help you to the max!<br/><br/>Thank you so much for your loving support! We'll see you at the first show!<br/>

CHALLENGESWe wish to convey our sincerity to you via our choosing a project and goal that is a stretch for us and yet very attainable. This is not a safe goal to go after, per say, because we want to grow and expand through this experience. Anyone who makes theater knows that we are setting out on a very modest budget to develop 4 shows, but we want to give you something special, something heartfelt, and we want to give you as much as possible this year. This means making FOUR NEW SHOWS for you this year, a goal that allows us to make things with quality and love and also with frequency. Producing one new show every 3 months will be a big feat to pull off, but we have reservations with a performance space for each show date, and a team around us to keep us on schedule.HOW TO HELP?While contribution is of course a wonderful way to build this new theater endeavor with us, there are so many other ways you can join in the fun. We are so grateful to you for getting the word out, for emailing friends, colleagues, and family, and for all your good vibes, juju, and encouragement. If purchasing tickets presents any hardship for you, please be in touch. We'll help you to the max!Thank you so much for your loving support! We'll see you at the first show!",1.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<p>My project is about the Body-Mind problem, thus it deals with the question whether a soul exists. This is a broad topic so I narrowed it down to  one of the 2 major theories about this problem.

This year marks the 25th anniversary of CACN from its first curtain call in 1989 and since then we have emphasized topics such as the homicide of Vincent Chen during the 1980s (<i>Catalyst, 2012</i>) and the history behind Chinese immigrants on Angel Island (<i>Angel Island, 2013</i>).<br/><br/>This year, our story revolves around a traditional, single father who grapples with the generational gap between himself and his three children.

This year marks the 25th anniversary of CACN from its first curtain call in 1989 and since then we have emphasized topics such as the homicide of Vincent Chen during the 1980s (Catalyst, 2012) and the history behind Chinese immigrants on Angel Island (Angel Island, 2013).This year, our story revolves around a traditional, single father who grapples with the generational gap between himself and his three children. It explores a struggle that many can relate to: the dichotomy between tradition versus modern Asian American ideals and how families come together to embrace one another's dreams. In addition to the drama portion of our production, CACN is also a showcase of various performances such as:
ACA Lion Dance
ACA Hip Hop

Traditional Dance (Chinese Cultural Dance Club, CCDC) 

Martial Arts (UCLA Kung Fu, UCLA Wushu)
Musical Student Performances
A Message from the ProducersDear Community Member,Thank you for allowing us the chance to share our annual Culture Night experience with you. Each year, the seats of Royce Hall are filled by undergraduate and graduate students, UCLA alumni, faculty, family members, and community leaders drawn from Westwood, West Los Angeles, Chinatown, and San Gabriel Valley. This year, we present the story of a single-parent father and his three children as they experience the strengths and restrictions of family. Through our exploration of generational disconnects, we aim to encourage dialogue about prominent issues affecting Asian Americans. We are making great strides to complete our production but we need your help.

As the university suffers from insufficient funding for outreach and cultural programs, it has become increasingly necessary for us to call upon the assistance of our community and those who support education through the arts. The annual cost of this production nears $30,000, making funding a necessary priority in our planning. Limited financial resources will prevent us from reaching our goals in the production of this show, but the support of our community will ensure our success. 
If you decide to become a supporter of our culture night, you will be showing over 1,800 audience members your support for the Asian American community. Furthermore, our show is the product of a year’s worth of incredible work put forth by students at various levels of involvement: production, acting, and cultural performance. Your support will help over 150 students discover the importance of community involvement and the empowerment, self-confidence, and joy such an experience brings.

Please help us reach our goals in educating a greater audience on issues that directly impact the Asian American community on and beyond the UCLA campus. On behalf of our student organization, we would like to express our gratitude and appreciation for your support.
Thank you very much for your time and consideration.Sincerely,Alan Chen & Peter WangProducers, CACN 2014

This page exists because it has been a long time dream of mine to direct a stage production, and I thought what better senior project than doing something I've dreamed of and supporting our local high school theatre?A bit about me:For those who don't know me, I'm a 17 year old about to go into my senior year of high school. I have been in theatre more or less all of my life, and ever since playing Scrooge in A Christmas Carol in seventh grade I have wanted to try directing. Some of the roles I have played in local theatre include:

Ebenezer Scrooge, A Christmas Carol, Sunfied Waldorf School

Mr. Tackleton, Cricket on the Hearth, Sunfield Waldorf School

D'artagnan, Three Musketeers, Port Townsend High School
Audrey 2, Little Shop of Horrors, Port Townsend High School
Sound Design, The Nerd, Port Townsend High School
Stage Crew, Cinderella, Key City Public Theatre

If you are receiving this directly from me, you already know who I am. If it has been forwarded to you by one of my amazing friends or family members, let me introduce myself. My name is Greg Campbell, and I'm attempting to raise funds to help me achieve my life-long dream. For those who are inclined to become a part of my adventure, in whatever way, on whatever level, I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

</p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">In a little over two months, Maggie, Rudy, and I (Maggie and Rudy are my sweet pups) will head to the Big Apple, where I’ve dreamt of living for as long as I can remember. Even before visiting, I knew it was the place for me. After my first time there, I was completely sold. I’ve been back several times since, and each time, I felt as if I were home.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Why New York City, you ask? Without question, the theater. From the first time I performed on a stage at Swift Elementary, I’ve been in love with acting. Since then, I’ve taken classes and performed on a somewhat irregular basis. This is when all that changes. I’m ready to pursue this dream wholeheartedly. In addition to acting, I also hope to publish and perform some of my own writing. In the past several years, I’ve begun to develop stories that I’d like to see produced on stage. I am committed to jumping in, buckling down, and giving all I have to pursue this dream of earning my keep as an actor/writer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I’ve been very encouraged by the gentle nudging of friends and, in the past couple years, a few students (I teach ESL) who have managed to rekindle this dream. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I turn 50 this year, and after doing a little research into “older” adults breaking in to this industry, I came upon the story of Kathryn Joosten. While you may not recognize the name, I’m sure you’d know her face. She packed up and moved to Los Angeles from Florida at the age of 55 to begin acting in television. She became quite well known as a character actress in sitcoms and a few dramas, most notably “The West Wing” and “Desperate Housewives.” Her story was just the spark I needed. George Eliot was right: “You’re never too old to be what you might’ve been.” Some sources quote it as “It’s never too late to be what you might've been.” In either case, the message has really struck a chord in me. The time is now!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Of course, breaking into this industry is not as simple as just moving to New York. I anticipate a tough, but I hope not incredibly long, road of daily auditions, searching for an agent, writing, and rewriting. If I could spend my first 6-12 months completely focused on this, I could really build a strong network within the theater community. Having a strong network is one of the most important aspects of establishing a theatrical career. Of course, younger folks have quite a bit more time to build on this. I’d like to concentrate my efforts, and really become a part of the theater community and my new city. In addition to pursuing my own dream, I plan to offer some of my time as a tutor to students who might otherwise not have the means to pursue theirs. I really want to play a meaningful part in my new home. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This is where you can help. While I’ve managed to put away some money in preparation for the move, I’ve come to realize that I need a bit more upfront to get settled in. The rental market in the New York City area is pretty hot right now, and current residents with higher incomes than I’ll have upon arriving are obviously more attractive to landlords. The one thing that would give me an advantage would be the ability to pay for the lease upfront. I’ve been looking primarily in Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx (Manhattan is out of the question), and I’ve regularly found pet-friendly apartments for between $750 and $1000 a month (less than I had anticipated). </span></p>

This is where you can help. While I’ve managed to put away some money in preparation for the move, I’ve come to realize that I need a bit more upfront to get settled in. The rental market in the New York City area is pretty hot right now, and current residents with higher incomes than I’ll have upon arriving are obviously more attractive to landlords. The one thing that would give me an advantage would be the ability to pay for the lease upfront. I’ve been looking primarily in Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx (Manhattan is out of the question), and I’ve regularly found pet-friendly apartments for between $750 and $1000 a month (less than I had anticipated). 

I always think of the story Carol Burnett tells of the anonymous donor who helped make it possible for her to pursue her dream. I'm asking for your help, and, eventually, I’d like to be like that donor and help others in any way I can. I’m a big believer in “paying it forward.”

Here’s how I’d like to spend my time during the first 6-12 months:
Concentrated networking
Acting / Playwriting Classes & Workshops
Auditioning for no-pay / low-pay parts / student & indie films
Cementing involvement in community
Donating tutoring / college prep time to lower-income schools / students

Daytime commitments (auditions)(agent search)(tutoring)
Evening / Weekend commitments (writing)(tutoring)

And here's what I need the money for:
$9,000 - $24,000 [one to two year lease paid in advance]
$1,500 - $3,000 acting / play writing classes [honing skills / networking]
$225 - $750 head shots
$4,500 - $13,500 [12 to 18 months monthly expenses]

I’m very excited and a little nervous about this new adventure, and I hope you’ll be a part of it. Take a look at the perks I’m offering in exchange for your donation. I hope you see something you like. Thanks so much for your support!

See you at the Tonys!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

La
obra
  Secretos Prohibidos es una obra de teatro basada en la
comedia del arte, sus máscaras y argumentos. Tere Marichal Lugo presenta una
historia en tres actos en la que el hilo conductor es el amor, la avaricia y
los secretos que cada personaje inventa para lograr sus objetivos. El espectáculo da inicio cuando una compañía de
actores llega a una plaza y anuncia la representación.
EPantalone
quiere casar a su hija Rosaura con Il
Dottore porque está en bancarrota, lo cual es falso. Il Dottore, que sí lo está, aunque lo disimule, quiere casar a su
hija Angélica con el Señor Pantalone.
Las hijas logran liberarse de su destino con la ayuda de sus sirvientes, que no
dejan de enredar y desenredarlo todo. Finalmente, triunfa el amor y se hace
justicia. Las mujeres ven coronados sus sueños de que se  respete su dignidad y los sirvientes,
su panza y los viejos pagan sus faltas.
Secretos prohibidos expresa con gracia y picardía,
situaciones muy divertidas que presentan diversas crítica sociales como la crisis
económica y el hambre.
 
En Puerto Rico, pocas
veces se ha presentado este género. Para nosotros es importante hacerlo y darle
continuidad. La meta de ¡A la porra! es presentar este trabajo en espacios
alternos (abiertos y cerrados) alrededor de la Isla y fuera de ésta. Además,
crear un taller de actores-creadores.
 
Sobre
la compañía ¡A la porra!
En
2012, Rosabel Otón y Maritza Martínez, fundaron ¡A la porra!, con la intención
de entrenar a un grupo de estudiantes y profesionales en las técnicas de la
comedia del arte italiana. Desde el 2007, Otón, directora artística de ¡A
la porra!, ofrece  un curso de
un año de commedia dell’arte en el
Departamento de Drama de la Universidad de Puerto Rico (UPR), Recinto de Río
Piedras. En el 2009 dirigió su primera producción en este estilo,  Arlequín,
vendedor de palizas. La obra, basada en un texto para teatro de títeres
inglés del siglo XIX, contó con la colaboración de las reconocidas artistas y maestras
Gilda Navarra y Nana Hudo. 
El
siguiente montaje fue  La muerta viva (2010), basada en un
argumento del Teatro de las Fábulas Representadas de Flaminio Scala (1611). La
obra, que se estrenó en el Recinto de Río Piedras de la UPR, viajó hasta los
pueblos de Cayey y Guayama, y se presentó en el Teatro Ramón Frade y en el
Teatro Calimano, respectivamente. En el 2011, la reposición de la obra se llevó
a cabo en el Teatro Experimental Julia de Burgos del Departamento de Drama de
la UPR.  Con La muerta viva dio inicio el trabajo colaborativo entre Rosabel
Otón y Maritza Martínez quien, además de educadora y coreógrafa, fue miembro
del desaparecido Taller de Histriones. 
En
el  2012, tocó el turno a Los cómicos del arte, una serie de canovacci (argumentos breves)  del siglo XVI, en el Teatrito
Experimental de la UPR de Río Piedras y luego en el Teatro de la Universidad
Interamericana, Recinto de Bayamón. En 2013 dirigió el primer acto de  Isabella
afortunada, de Flaminio Scala, como parte del programa de un maratón
artístico, organizado por la profesora y coreógrafa Petra Bravo, directora de
la compañía de danza contemporánea, Hincapié.
Los
talleres pedagógicos de ¡A la porra!
dieron inicio en septiembre  2011,
bajo la dirección de Rosabel Otón y Maritza Martínez. Desde entonces, un grupo
de actores profesionales en unión a una selección de  estudiantes entrenados en commedia dell’arte, ha desarrollado un pequeño e intenso
laboratorio de investigación teatral, basado en el arte de la improvisación y
en los argumentos y las  máscaras
de la commedia dell’arte. Entre los
artistas colaboradores se encuentran: Julio Ramos, Ramfis González e Iliana
García. Secretos prohibidos es el
segundo texto escrito por Tere Marichal, inspirado en la commedia dell’arte. ¡A la
porra!, una compañía teatral que nace del trabajo de un grupo de actores
profesionales y estudiantes, asume el reto de montarla y agradece la confianza
de la autora y de todos los artistas que se han unido al proyecto.

</div></div>","Children learn the most by hacking into their toys and asking questions, they said!But today’s children are playing with face fillers, internet algorithms, have seen self-driving cars, and whatnot! How do we break into these 21-st century toys?Well, let children learn programming, AI, robotics, etc., and let them mimic these real-world applications with the projects they make.How? Meet Quarky, A re-programmable robot by profession, and a cute learning companion by passion, that children can create dozens of real-world-inspired projects with.   Quarky, through it’s interactive interface and engaging hands-on experience, teaches programming and robotics while introducing children to a multitude of artificial intelligence and machine learning concepts.  Quarky is pretty handy, is loaded with features allowing real-time wireless interaction via WiFi and Bluetooth, works with both block-based programming and Python, is complemented with online courses to assist students in their learning, and can be programmed using phones, tabs, or laptops.  Quarky is not just another robot with basic pre-decided activities. With its versatile features, wide variety of kits and add-ons, a child’s imagination is the only limit. Because it was a HIT on Kickstarter!And it’s on Indiegogo to further the revolution.STEMpedia, the creator behind Quarky, has an experience of running two successful, fully-delivered crowdfunding campaigns - evive and STEMpedia on Indiegogo - with over 99% satisfaction rate.Upon getting validation from industry experts at CES 2020, STEMpedia levelled up its efforts towards making AI education accessible to kids in every corner of the world. Since then, it has been the talk of the town with media and DIY-ers writing about, testing, and reviewing Quarky for you.Whatever they want to, duh!No, we are serious! Project-making experience with Quarky is proven to improve their problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, creative approaches, and make their thought process a little more innovative. In other words, hone their 21st-century skills. And there’s hardly any limit to what kids can make with Quarky, let’s take a look at a few of them. “It’s like conceptually reverse engineering a Tesla at 1/500th the $$$$.” - Nicola Edison “I'll never let you go, Keep me by your side” - Quarky Onus Blue Raye “Kevin would’ve been less troublesome if he was Home Alone in 2021.” - Kevin’s Mom “I wish my child was this-obedient, not disobedient” - Shin Chan’s Mom “Mirror mirror on the wall, who’s child is the naughtiest of all” - Unknown Parent “AI AI AI, AI AI AI, (Don’t) Let it rain over me” - Smart Anthony AND MUCH MUCH MORE ...  Quarky has been tested by 500+ students and 50+ educators across 20+ countries over the course of 6 months. This is what they have to say: 
 



Well, because it’s ultra-powerful, feature-packed and appropriately assisted.
This reconfigurable and reprogrammable robot kit comes with 6 Online Self-Paced Courses that allow children to delve into concepts like object detection and identification, face and voice recognition, gesture-tracking, path planning, optical character recognition, machine learning, and much more, via dozens of interactive activities.
 
 
 
Learn to code with Scratch and Python within a single, omni-platform programming interface - PictoBlox and let your imaginations go wild. With PictoBlox, kids can code their palm-sized buddy, anytime and anywhere.
 

 
Messy wires, breadboards, soldering things together, etc. can be a nightmare at a tender age. But should we let this scare kids from getting their hands dirty? No way! That’s why Quarky comes with tons of built-in electromechanical components like LEDs, motors, sensors, buzzers, etc., so that making AI projects never gets tedious.
 
 
 
Quarky is not a product, it’s a feeling, an indulgence, a wholesome learning ecosystem in itself. It keeps things simple and interesting, so that kids never want to stop playing and learning, making every day a brand-new DIY-ing experience.
 

 
 
Wondering what’s the secret behind Quarky’s endless capabilities?
Based on ESP32, Quarky is a reprogrammable robot with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Despite being pocket-sized, it packs a plethora of on-board elements that make it easy for kids to integrate with programming platforms to work on AI and IoT projects. Take a look for yourself- 

 

Let us highlight it again, Quarky is not just a product, but a carefully crafted learning ecosystem that guides children from zero to being an AI hero!
Each Quarky kit is accompanied by up to 6 Online Self-Paced STEM.ORG certified courses. They help start a child’s AI journey while covering all the aspects step-by-step.
 


Quarky is available as two basic variants - the Innovator Kit that facilitates hands-on AI activities with 2-robot variations, includes an arena, recognition cards, etc.; and the Ultimate Kit that includes everything from the Innovator Kit, and packs more mechanical parts for 10-robot variations, includes an additional arena, extra electronic components, and much more. Read more below:
 

 


Add-Ons are additional boxes of electro-mechanical parts that will help children dive deeper into a specific concept. These are meant to be used in addition to the basic variants above, and enable children to experiment with complex robot types/families, like the Mars Rover or a Humanoid, or add more flavor to the playfulness with more avatars for your projects with the Creatives pack, or maybe explore swarm robotics with additional Quarky boards (i.e. the Explorer). Read more below:
 

 
Based on NASA's 2020 Perseverance Rover‘s design, this pack adds 10+ variations of a celestial robo-marvel to your Quarky Army. With rocker-bogie and differential-arm mechanisms, this baby got all-terrain moves!
 

 
No Army could be complete without bi-pedal soldiers marching on the frontlines. And when they’re this cute and cuddly and have got all the necessary moves, they are never losing a war for you.
 

 
If looks could kill, Quarky Army would be the deadliest out there! They are a cultural revolution, you have to include folks from all shapes and colors. Grab a set of 12+ avatars for your robots and projects and make your Quarky Army look majestic!
 

 
Get an additional set of Quarky board (+accessories) to add more Quarkiness to your projects. Technically, this add-on enables swarm robotics flavor to the AI & robotics adventure.

<p>Package Recommendation:</p>
<p> Research Basic Kit: For deep custom users, you need to prepare: soldering iron, 3D printed machine, battery, charger, controller, Raspberry Pi, SD card.</p>
<p> Research Kit:  You only need to prepare: Controller, Raspberry Pi, SD card.</p>
<p> Complete kit： Includes all the parts and tools to build and program.</p>
<p> Full Mini Pupper: Everything you will need to run and program your Mini Pupper Robot right out of the box.  All software is installed and calibration has been completed.</p>
<p> Add-Ons: </p>
<p>Lidar module: If you want to explore ROS SLAM, Navigation functions based on Lidar, you also need a Lidar module. We can ONLY ensure the Lidar module can work well based on our source code, and NOT ensure that you get from other channels. We fixed some software problems based on our source code, and if you like, we can also share with you our ROS2 driver for this Lidar. Definitely, we will supply a user guide to let you use it easily. We already tested some Lidar modules, such as, PRLidar A1, YDLidar X2L, and LD06. For Mini Pupper, we refer to LD06 as it is smaller. LD06 Lidar module price is same as their campaign price, but we will ship one additional Mini Pupper servo as a gift.</p>
<p> Camera module: For potential security issues, the camera module is not included in our default package. If you want to explore camera AI functions, you can choose a normal USB camera module, of course, a 3D camera module is better for study. If try the 3D camera module, we recommend you OpenCV's latest 3D camera module, named OAK-D LITE, comes from OpenCV&amp;Luxonis. We will supply a user guide to let you use it easily.  </p>

</div></div>","Picture a dog-shaped quadruped robot that can hop, trot, and run around, supporting 12-DOF, ROS (Robot Operating System) SLAM, Navigation, and OpenCV AI functions—while being inexpensive. Mini Pupper is the dream sidekick for you to learn and experiment with robotics, exploring advanced functions of a dynamic robot that would typically not be available at this price point.  In June 2021, MangDang released Mini Pupper on the Stanford Pupper website in collaboration with Nathan Kau, the original creator of Stanford Pupper, to bring to market a commercial and reasonably priced educational quadruped robot that anyone could engagingly use for fun robotics research and experiments.  Mini Pupper’s design was based on the feedback we received from our existing customers. The ease of use, assembly and disassembly are the result of precious feedback from users that allowed us to keep improving what ultimately came to be a user-centric robot that you can easily understand, explore, learn from, and play with—and for a price that most can afford!Mini Pupper is a dog-shaped robot that is aimed at stimulating and empowering your creativity. That’s why we are not presenting it as a closed project that can’t evolve from here. On the contrary, Mini Pupper leverages Ubuntu and ROS to operate its FSN (Full Self-Navigation) System.Mini Pupper supports not only Melodic but also Noetic. ROS2 is also in our pipeline.  SLAMMiniPupper supports SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), it can map its environment and learn in real-time from things around using Lidar or a camera sensor.   NavigationWith the map, Mini Pupper can answer ""where am I? Where am I going?"" you can call it self-driving technology.   Mini Pupper is an open-source dog robot you can explore whatever you want! Mini Pupper's software is compatible with Robot Operating System (ROS) using a forked version of Champ Quadrupedal Framework led by Juan Miguel Jimeno. The software stack runs on a customized hardware based on Stanford's Pupper project. Many thanks to the open source community for making Mini Pupper a reality. Mini Pupper is an open-source dog robot you can explore whatever you want! Mini Pupper's software is compatible with Robot Operating System (ROS) using a forked version of Champ Quadrupedal Framework led by Juan Miguel Jimeno. The software stack runs on a customized hardware based on Stanford's Pupper project. Many thanks to the open source community for making Mini Pupper a reality. SoftwareGait PerformanceYou can use Mini Pupper to explore many gait performances, such as Trot (diagonal pairs), Pace (lateral pairs), and the Bound (front and rear pairs). 'Facial AnimationYou can easily custom your own facial animation, mechanical shell, and your own algorithms, we will supply enough guide documents and videos to make it easy. Here are three preset animations, you can change and make your own set by just one click!  HardwareYou can DIY and customize a UNIQUE MiniPupper in the world.  Check out those MiniPuppers created by our fans!  Mini Pupper supports OpenCV's latest 3D camera module, named OAK-D LITE, it brings the superpowers of Spatial AI to the price-point necessary to unlock all sorts of applications. With the module, Mini Pupper can run face detect, recognition, object detect, recognition, etc.  With OAK-D-Lite vision, it's now your Border-Collie-level smart robotic dog. Border Collies are amazing because they can learn very specific hand signals (and they're neurotic about them). Now Mini Pupper can be just as amazing (and neurotic)!   Custom servoServo is the key component to a robot dog. We've got high torque custom servos which allows it to go fast and stable. We didn't just choose the cheapest option, we chose the right option. We wanted it to have personality and be approachable. and draw people in.  12DOFMost robots of this category feature an 8 DOF (degree of freedom), which translates into less organic movements. We were not happy with the idea of limiting Mini Pupper to these constraints, so, after extensive debate within our team and research, we were eventually able to create our quadruped robot with a 12 DOF that allows it to follow biological movements but at an affordable price point that isn’t made inaccessible to the average consumer.  IterationYou can find our Mini Pupper Prototype, on Dec 2020, we used more than 8+ months to make Mini Pupper stable and more perfect for you to use.   Raspberry Pi Based on Raspberry Pi, MiniPupper is super expandable. You can explore more with MiniPupper!  How to use it?You can use the controller to enjoy and explore Mini Pupper's many features. Besides that, you can easily custom your own facial animation and algorithms by PC, we will supply enough guide documents and videos to make it easy.   While Mini Pupper provides an exciting journey into the world of robotics for anyone, there’s a central educational mission that this unique robot needs to accomplish. Mini Pupper wants to help you learn about robotics and experiment with this brave new world in a fun way. 


 

That’s why we’re also organizing an online course series that is tied to understanding and exploring Mini Pupper—namely the mechanical, hardware, ROS, SLAM, navigation, AI, and other angles of the robot. In other words, for you, this is the robotic educational experience of a lifetime!
Open source: Mini Pupper is inspired by Stanford Pupper open source project. You can find and download the design files and source code from the Mini Pupper Github project link. Mini Pupper was featured by Hackaday, Hackster, Make, won a Hackaday Prize. We got so much help from the Hackaday community, such as project reviews from Majenta and Mitch, Hack Chat support from Dan Maloney. Really really thanks for all the open source communities. 

HackChat
It’s our pleasure to share all that we know, if you have any questions, please join the Robot Dogs #HackChat, Wednesday, Sept. 29th at Noon Pacific. Click here to join! 
With the OpenCV 3D camera module, named OAK-D LITE, Mini Pupper can track hands and/or full body pose in full 3D coordinates. It's endless possibilities. Many thanks to  Brandon Gilles's great help from the OpenCV and Luxonis communities. 

 
 

Mini Pupper can run on Ubuntu and ROS, now the ROS version is Melodic, updating to Noetic, ROS2 is also on our pipeline. It can support SLAM, Navigation and other ROS features. On 6th Oct. will host an interview with Kat Scott from the ROS & Open Robotics community. We got much help and support from Kat, really appreciate Kat’s great help.

Depending on the learning level, practice takes between 70-95% of the total playing time. This overwhelming period is spent on his/her own.</p><p>However, all pupils invest a lot of growth potential in the exercise period, the progress stays small and stagnant. As a consequence, there is a lack of pleasure and exercise demolitions are not seldom.</p><p>As a solution, a software system is needed, which can transfer the quality of the lesson under the teacher’s control into the practicing period on alone.</p><p>The music educational software <strong>Accento</strong> combines frequency, rhythm and timbre recognition techniques accompanied by a didactically built collection of music pieces. The students of all performance levels would be able to use the software, especially at home during the practice hours.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://www.bacco.co.at/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MelodicErrors.gif"" src=""""/></p><p>A musician plays the notes marked on the screen and receives feedback about the correctly or incorrectly played notes after it. In the second step, the program runs the appropriate exercises suggested and selected according to the student's errors to correct and practice them. All exercises are performed at appropriate speeds and small increases in tempo, so that at the end of the correction unit (2nd step) the play is guaranteed to be mastered.</p><p>The instrument educational material is designed by top musicians and consist of well-known and self-composed songs, exercises and etudes. The music pieces are integrated into the didactic learning concept and are coordinated with each other. The different levels of difficulty are combined with the different music styles so that one can choose from many different music sheets of different styles. Thus, the learning path is individually adapted to the needs of a student.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://www.bacco.co.at/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Harmonic_1.gif"" src=""""/></p><p>The quality and the intensity of personal instrumental lessons with a teacher are to be transferred to the exercise period. In this way, the musician has to be optimally looked after, especially during the practicing period - which takes more than 80% of the total playing time.</p><p>It is also very important to hold the body correctly while playing an instrument. Our program will also give feedback to the users according to their body position.</p><p>Two target groups will achieve significant benefits with the use of <strong>Accento</strong>:</p><p>STUDENTS:</p><ul>
<li>Students will increase learning speed.</li>
<li>Students will have fun with their instruments through permanent learning. The drop-out rate of the students will go down.</li>
<li>Through the interaction with the program and different tempos, a learner will have a constant metric guidance, which will develop an inner metric.</li>
<li>The musicians will learn and practice only the correct and necessary skills and won’t consolidate the wrong habits.</li>
<li>Students / parents will save time and money in the long term!</li>
</ul><p>TEACHERS:</p><ul>
<li>Teachers will teach more successfully.</li>
<li> A student will develop an exercise discipline, which is designed by the trained instrument specialists.</li>
<li>He/she will be better prepared for the lesson, will not make unnecessary exercising and mistakes, which will simplify weekly exercises, since it will be possible to work on the music problems instead on the constant correction of the learnt habits.</li>

Los estudiantes de todas las edades y niveles usarán el Software sobre todo en sus hogares durante la práctica de sus respectivos instrumentos. Los músicos tocarán las piezas mostradas en la pantalla de sus dispositivos, y una vez finalizada la ejecución tendrán la oportunidad de visualizar los errores realizados. A continuación el programa le sugerirá al usuario ejercicios técnicos para corregir los errores cometidos. Los ejercicios serán ejecutados con una aceleración gradual del Tempo, para garantizar de esta manera la culminación exitosa de la pieza correspondiente.</p><p>Las piezas de los métodos serán concebidas por renombrados pedagogos comprendiendo las obras más importantes de la literatura de cada instrumento, así como arreglos propios. Diferentes estilos y niveles de dificultad serán combinados de manera que en cada nivel sea posible escoger diferentes piezas, posibilitando de esta manera la elección de un recorrido individual que se adapte a las exigencias o problemas de cada alumno.</p><p>De esta forma la calidad e intensidad de las clases instrumentales serán trasladadas a la práctica diaria.

Depending on the learning level, practice takes between 70-95% of the total playing time. This overwhelming period is spent on his/her own.However, all pupils invest a lot of growth potential in the exercise period, the progress stays small and stagnant. As a consequence, there is a lack of pleasure and exercise demolitions are not seldom.As a solution, a software system is needed, which can transfer the quality of the lesson under the teacher’s control into the practicing period on alone.The music educational software Accento combines frequency, rhythm and timbre recognition techniques accompanied by a didactically built collection of music pieces. The students of all performance levels would be able to use the software, especially at home during the practice hours.A musician plays the notes marked on the screen and receives feedback about the correctly or incorrectly played notes after it. In the second step, the program runs the appropriate exercises suggested and selected according to the student's errors to correct and practice them. All exercises are performed at appropriate speeds and small increases in tempo, so that at the end of the correction unit (2nd step) the play is guaranteed to be mastered.The instrument educational material is designed by top musicians and consist of well-known and self-composed songs, exercises and etudes. The music pieces are integrated into the didactic learning concept and are coordinated with each other. The different levels of difficulty are combined with the different music styles so that one can choose from many different music sheets of different styles. Thus, the learning path is individually adapted to the needs of a student.The quality and the intensity of personal instrumental lessons with a teacher are to be transferred to the exercise period. In this way, the musician has to be optimally looked after, especially during the practicing period - which takes more than 80% of the total playing time.It is also very important to hold the body correctly while playing an instrument. Our program will also give feedback to the users according to their body position.Two target groups will achieve significant benefits with the use of Accento:STUDENTS:
Students will increase learning speed.
Students will have fun with their instruments through permanent learning. The drop-out rate of the students will go down.
Through the interaction with the program and different tempos, a learner will have a constant metric guidance, which will develop an inner metric.
The musicians will learn and practice only the correct and necessary skills and won’t consolidate the wrong habits.
Students / parents will save time and money in the long term!
TEACHERS:
Teachers will teach more successfully.
 A student will develop an exercise discipline, which is designed by the trained instrument specialists.
He/she will be better prepared for the lesson, will not make unnecessary exercising and mistakes, which will simplify weekly exercises, since it will be possible to work on the music problems instead on the constant correction of the learnt habits.
Teachers' reputation will be enhanced by the successes of their students.

中文简介对于每个学音乐的人来说，在没有老师帮助下的练习是最漫长的。 根据学习水平，练习的时间会占70-95％，这意味着学生大部分时间都要孤军奋战。因此，学生花费大量时间来提高他们的技能，但进展可能缓慢或停滞，这或许会导致其失去兴趣或在某些情况下放弃。因此，我们需要一个软件系统，使个人的练习达到在老师指导下一样的质量。音乐软件ACCENTO是一个将音乐作品与频率、节奏和语音识别技术相结合的教育系统，所有水平的学生都可以在自己的练习中使用该软件。首先，学生弹奏屏幕上的音符，软件继而向用户给出相应评价，包括是否正确和错误。第二步，软件将向用户提供适当的练习，以校正用户弹错的部分。 整个训练基于适当的速度，并循序渐进来提升速度，因此学生将能够在第二步中完全掌握该部分。该软件的培训材料由顶级音乐家设计，包括著名歌曲、自编歌曲和练习曲。 这些曲目根据教学方法，结合不同难度和音乐风格。用户可以选择各种音乐作品， 因此，这种学习方法将满足每个学生的需求。通过教师辅导而获得的质量和强度，也可以在个人的练习当中实现。个人练习对音乐学生来说非常重要，所以学生需要很明智地运用练习时间。以正确的姿势演奏乐器也非常重要，该软件还将提供学生姿势的反馈。使用ACCENTO时，这两组人群将获得相当大的好处：学生
您可以更快地提高演奏技能。
学习变得更有趣了，学生辍学率大幅减少。
通过和程序的互动，如改变速度，学生可以培养自己的内在乐感。
您不会养成错误的习惯，因为您只学习、练习正确和必要的方法。
长远角度看，学生/家长可以节约时间、减少开销。
教师：
教师将提高教学质量。
学习体系会提升，因为练习方式是由顶尖专家设计的。
学生将更好地为课程做好准备，不会做不必要的练习、犯不必要的错误，这使每周的课程更有效率；学生会解决音乐问题，而不是不断纠正学习习惯。
学生的成功将提高教师的声誉。

 한국어짧은 요약음악을 배우는 학생들에게 있어서 교사의 도움 없이 홀로 연습하는 시간은 각자의 수준에 따라 대략 70-95%로 나타나며 이는 대부분의 시간을 혼자서 보낸다는 것을 의미합니다.이처럼 학생들은 많은 시간을 실력 향상을 위해 투자하지만 진전이 더디거나 정체될 수 있으며 이는 결과적으로 흥미를 잃거나 경우에 따라 도중에 포기하게 되는 원인이 되기도 합니다.따라서 해결책으로, 레슨의 질을 연습으로 고스란히 이어줄 시스템이 필요합니다.음악 소프트웨어인 ACCENTO는 음악 작품들과 주파수, 리듬, 음색 인식 기술이 결합된 교육 시스템이며 모든 수준의 학생들이 본인의 연습에서 이 소프트웨어를 사용할 수 있습니다.사용자는 화면에 표시된 음표(연주 과제)를 연주한 뒤 올바르게 연주한 부분과 잘못 연주한 부분에 대한 피드백을 받게 되며 두번째 단계에서는 프로그램이 사용자가 잘못 연주한 부분을 바로잡을 수 있는 적절한 연습 방법을 제시합니다. 전체적인 훈련은 적절한 속도와 점진적인 템포의 증가를 바탕으로 이루어지므로 이 두번째 단계를 거치면 해당 부분을 완전히 숙달할 수 있게 될 것입니다. 이 프로그램의 교육 자료들은 최고의 음악가들이 디자인 하였으며 잘 알려진 곡들을 포함하여 자체적으로 제작한 곡들, 연습방법, 그리고 에튀드 등으로 구성되어 있습니다. 이 곡들은 교육학적인 수업방안에 따라 구성 되었으며 각기 다른 난이도와 음악 스타일과 결합되었으므로 모든 레벨에서 다양한 음악 작품을 선택할 수 있습니다. 따라서 이 학습은 사용자의 요구를 충족시킬 것입니다.사람과의 개인 교습을 통해 얻을 수 있는 퀄리티와 강도는 연습 시간으로도 이어져야 합니다. 음악가에게 있어서 연습은 매우 중요하므로 이를 잘 관리할 필요가 있습니다.또한 올바른 자세로 악기를 연주하는 것도 굉장히 중요하며 이 프로그램은 사용자의 자세에 대한 피드백도 제공할 것입니다.두 그룹은 ACCENTO를 사용시 상당한 이점을 얻을 것입니다.학생 :더 빠른 속도로 실력을 향상시킬 수 있습니다.지속적으로 교육을 재미있게 할 수 있기 때문에 도중에 포기할 염려를 줄일 수 있습니다.프로그램과 다양한 상호 작용을 통해 본인만의 연습 체계를 만들어 나갈 수 있습니다.정확하고 필요한 기술들만을 배우고 연습하기 때문에 잘못 된 습관을 가지지 않을것입니다.돈을 절약할 수 있습니다.교사:교육의 질을 향상시킬 수 있습니다.교사의 명성은 학생들의 성공으로 인하여 향상됩니다.학생들은 특별히 숙련 된 전문가가 디자인 한 실습을 통해 본인의 연습 시스템을 향상시킬 것입니다.학생들이 더욱 준비된 상태로 수업에 임하게 되어 불필요한 작업이 줄어들고 더욱 더 효과적인 수업으로 이어지게 될 것입니다.우리는 다음과 같은 악기부터 시작합니다 : 피아노, 기타, 플룻, 그리고 바이올린소프트웨어는 공개되어있으며 모든 사용자가 자신의 음악 재료들을 사용할 수 있습니다.Windows, Apple MacOS, iOS 및 Linux (Android는 곧 제공됨) 용 무료 데모 프로그램 (버전 0.98)은 당사 웹 사이트에서 다운로드 할 수 있습니다.설명 : 현재 데모는 피아노 (레코드는 미디 장치에서만 가능), 기타, 플루트 및 바이올린 (내장 마이크를 통해서만 레코딩 가능)과 같은 악기를 지원합니다. 다음 릴리스에서는 피아노와 기타로 녹음 된 미디 레코드에 대한 지원이 추가 될 예정입니다. 앱 사용법은 마지막 동영상에 설명되어 있습니다.웹 :  https://www.accento.appFree Demo-Program: https://www.bacco.co.at/demo-ko페이스북: https://www.facebook.com/AccentoAppInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/accentoapp트위터: https://twitter.com/AccentoApp만일 결제에 문제가 있으면 office@bacco.co.at로 연락하십시오.특전 :당신은 다양하게 조합 된 상품들을 (특전참조) 할인된 가격으로 만나보실 수 있습니다.이 소프트웨어는 iOS, OSX, Android, Windows 및 Linux (모든 배포판)과 호환되며 영어, 독일어, 스페인어, 중국어와 한국어 (요청시 다른 언어) 등으로 데스크탑, 태블릿 PC, 스마트폰에서 실행하실 수 있습니다.Android는 버전 5.0부터 지원됩니다.50유로, 라이센스 1개 (3개의 기기, PC와 태블릿, 스마트 폰에서 자유롭게 선택 가능) + Accento 2.0 으로의 주요 업그레이드가 한번 제공됩니다.100유로, 2개의 라이센스와Accento 2.0 으로의 주요 업그레이드가 한번 제공됩니다.150유로, 3개의 라이센스와Accento 2.0 으로의 주요 업그레이드가 한번 제공됩니다.Bronze Sponsor: 500유로, 귀하의 이름은 독일어, 영어 및 스페인어로 1년간 제품에 명시되며. 4 개의 라이센스와 1 개의 주요 업그레이드가 포함되어 있습니다.Silver Sponsor: 1000유로, 귀하의 이름은 독일어, 영어 및 스페인어로 1년간 제품에 명시되며. 5 개의 라이센스와 1 개의 주요 업그레이드가 포함되어 있습니다.Gold Sponsor: 2000유로, 귀하의 이름은 독일어, 영어, 스페인어,  중국어 및 한국어로 2년간 제품에 명시되며. 6개의 라이센스와 1 개의 주요 업그레이드가 포함되어 있습니다.Platinum Sponsor: 5000유로, 귀하의 이름은 독일어, 영어, 스페인어,  중국어 및 한국어로 3년간 제품에 명시되며. 7개의 라이센스와 1 개의 주요 업그레이드가 포함되어 있습니다.DeutschKurzbeschreibungFür jeden Musiker stellt die Übungszeit ohne Lehrer den weitaus größten Musizierzeitraum dar. Je nach Niveau nimmt die Übungszeit zwischen 70-95% der gesamten Spielzeit ein. Diese weitaus überwiegende Zeit verbringt der Musiker ohne seinen Lehrer, er/sie ist auf sich allein gestellt.Allerdings verschenken Schüler in der Übungszeit sehr viel Entwicklungspotenzial, wodurch der Fortschritt kleiner ist, oder stagniert. Die Folge ist mangelnde Lust und nicht selten der Abbruch.Als Lösung ist ein System notwendig, welches die Qualität des Unterrichts in die Übungszeit überträgt.Die Musik-Lernsoftware Accento kombiniert Frequenz,  Rhythmus und Klangfarbe-Erkennungs-Technik begleitet mit einem umfassend didaktisch aufgebauten System von Musikstücken. Musikschüler aller Leistungsstufen sollen die Software vor allem zu Hause in den Übungsstunden verwenden.Der Musiker spielt die am Bildschirm/Display markierten Noten (Spielaufgabe) und erhält nach dem Spiel eine Rückmeldung über richtig und falsch gespielte Noten. Im zweiten Schritt durchläuft das Programm mit dem Schüler passende Übungen – vorgeschlagen vom Programm und je nach Fehlerstellen des Schülers vom Programm ausgewählt - um die gespielten Fehler zu korrigieren. Sämtliche Übungen erfolgen in passenden Spielgeschwindigkeiten und kleinen Temposteigerungen, sodass am Ende der Korrektureinheit (2. Schritt) die Spielaufgabe garantiert bewältigt wird. Das Notenmaterial wird von Spitzenmusikern konzipiert und besteht aus bekannten und selbst komponierten Liedern, Übungen, Etüden. Die Musikstücke sind in ein didaktisches Lernkonzept eingebunden und aufeinander abgestimmt. Verschiedene Schwierigkeitsgrade werden mit verschiedenen Musikstilen kombiniert, sodass auf jedem Niveau viele Musikstücke unterschiedlichster Art gewählt werden können. Somit wird der Lernweg individuell den Bedürfnissen des Schülers angepasst.Die Qualität und Intensität des persönlichen Instrumentalunterrichts mit dem Lehrer soll auf die Übungszeit übertragen werden. Damit soll der Musiker vor allem in der Übungszeit - welche den weitaus größten Teil der gesamten Spielzeit ausmacht - optimal betreut werden.Auch die Körperhaltung beim Spielen eines Instrumentes ist sehr wichtig, unser Programm wird auch ein Feedback  diesbezüglich den Benutzern gebenZwei Zielgruppen erzielen mit der Verwendung von Accento einen erheblichen Nutzen:SCHÜLER:
Der Schüler steigert die Lerngeschwindigkeit.
Die Schüler haben durch dauerhafte Lernerfolge Spaß mit ihrem Instrument. Die Abbruchsquote der Schüler sinkt.
Die Schüler/Eltern sparen langfristig Zeit und Geld!
Durch die Interaktion mit dem Programm und den verschiedenen Tempos hat der Lernende eine konstante metrische Führung, wodurch dieser eine innere Metrik entwickeln kann.
Man lernt /übt nur die richtigen Fertigkeiten und man festigt nicht falsche Angewohnheiten.  
LEHRER:
Die Lehrer unterrichten erfolgreicher.
Die Reputation der Lehrer wird durch die Erfolge seiner Schüler gesteigert.
Der Schüler wird eine Übungsdisziplin entwickeln, welche speziell ausgebildeten Fachkräfte gestalten
Der Schüler kommt besser vorbereitet zur Stunde, macht weniger unnötige Fehler, was die wöchentliche Arbeit vereinfachen wird, da es möglich sein wird an den musikalischen Problemen zu arbeiten anstatt falsch gelernte Abläufe andauernd korrigieren zu müssen.

EspañolDescripciónLa práctica de un instrumento sin la compañía de un docente representa para cada músico el periodo más prolongado de la práctica musical. De acuerdo al nivel del instrumentista, la práctica individual representa entre el 70 y el 95% del tiempo total de ejecución. Durante todo ese tiempo cada músico ejercita su instrumento sin la presencia de su maestro, el/ella depende solo de si mismo.No obstante la mayor parte de los estudiantes de música desperdicia una gran cantidad de potencial durante la práctica diaria, la evolución es mínima o en su defecto se produce un estancamiento. El resultado es insuficiente motivación y con mucha frecuencia el abandono de la práctica musical.Como solución es necesario crear un sistema que traslade la calidad de las clases a la práctica diaria.El Software de pedagogia musical Accento combina el reconocimiento de la frecuencia, el ritmo y el timbre siendo acompañado por un sistema pedagógico de obras progresivas. Los estudiantes de todas las edades y niveles usarán el Software sobre todo en sus hogares durante la práctica de sus respectivos instrumentos. Los músicos tocarán las piezas mostradas en la pantalla de sus dispositivos, y una vez finalizada la ejecución tendrán la oportunidad de visualizar los errores realizados. A continuación el programa le sugerirá al usuario ejercicios técnicos para corregir los errores cometidos. Los ejercicios serán ejecutados con una aceleración gradual del Tempo, para garantizar de esta manera la culminación exitosa de la pieza correspondiente.Las piezas de los métodos serán concebidas por renombrados pedagogos comprendiendo las obras más importantes de la literatura de cada instrumento, así como arreglos propios. Diferentes estilos y niveles de dificultad serán combinados de manera que en cada nivel sea posible escoger diferentes piezas, posibilitando de esta manera la elección de un recorrido individual que se adapte a las exigencias o problemas de cada alumno.De esta forma la calidad e intensidad de las clases instrumentales serán trasladadas a la práctica diaria. Así será posible aprovecharla al máximo y acelerar considerablemente el aprendizaje musical.La postura es también muy importante al tocar un instrumento. Nuestro programa también ofrecerá un  control sobre posibles errores de postura durante la ejecución.Dos grupos de usuarios percibirán con el uso de Accento enormes beneficios:ESTUDIANTES

Don’t worry if you’re not familiar with Python- you’ll learn all the basics in this book, with no programming experience required!  If you’ve already gotten started with Python, reinforce your knowledge and logical thinking with more code examples! When you run the book’s Python programs on your computer, you’ll see the nursery rhymes and fairy tales printed out on your screen! Each spread in the book consists of a code page next to a full-page illustration depicting the scene.Each code page has a full nursery rhyme or partial fairy tale (spread over multiple code pages) written in English above its associated Python program. The program’s code is explained below it.Before this program, Goldilocks tries the three bowls of porridge and the three chairs…you know the story! :) Most of the nursery rhymes output the original verse word-for-word on the screen, while some output the story in a slightly different manner (ex. Piggy #1 instead of This little piggy).This program outputs The Muffin Man word-for-word.Each program demonstrates one or more new Python concepts.  You can run all the programs on your computer! Python is free to download and install. You can also use a free online Python interpreter.The programs print output to the screen with print functions.You can modify the code and see how the story changes (ex. turn The Muffin Man into The Cupcake Man)!  You’ll also enjoy the whimsical art depicting the classic stories!Python is a popular, easy to learn programming language. It’s used in many fields including data science, scientific computing, AI, machine learning, web development, and game development. It’s also used to program educational/hobbyist hardware platforms like the Raspberry Pi and micro:bit boards.Programming enhances important life skills including logical thinking, planning, organization, problem solving, and creativity.This book is for all ages!

Take your 35x objective (in some cases also 75x will work fine) and lay it on the water.

Whether you use it for research, education, or just for fun, from the observation of microorganisms or cells to mineralogy and materials science, with DIPLE anyone can access the microworld in detail! 3 different objective lenses for 3 different levels of magnification and related applicationsSince Spring 2021, all our kits are ready to ship; if we do not ship your DIPLE within 12 days from the order, you can get the full refund.Here are some of the first messages from our supporters:During last months DIPLE has been selected and used for Science education in many schools and universities; DIPLE has been used for classes at the Cornell Univ., Wisconsin Univ., Occidental College, TUM, CUNY, etc.... 
The compactness of DIPLE perfectly suits any situation in which a microscope of the size of a pencil case (that can be packed up in a minute!) is needed. And with all the sofware capabilities offered by modern smartphones/tablets (pics, videos, sharing...).
Since our first prototypes in early 2019 (the ones in the original video and campaign), the final product has added major improvements. Among the most noticeable, the durability and resistance of the packaging has strongly improved, with now a box made in robust plastic, to guarantee a long lifespan to your microscope, even in the harshest environments.

Human red blood cells on DIPLE Black&Fine DIPLE is capable of giving you 1000x magnification using your smartphone or tablet as a monitor. Set up takes seconds - all you need to do is place your camera on the optical system. You can even take pictures and videos in HD!Pollen grains on DIPLE Grey - courtesy of Margaret Frank, Cornell UniversityWater bear on DIPLE GreyTo make sure that DIPLE is truly portable for exploration on the go, we have designed it to easily withstand being dropped - even from the third floor of a building (yes, we did the test!). Available in single or coupled lenses depending on the level of magnification required, such an advanced system has never been used for microscopy on smartphones (it is patent pending). DIPLE provides an unprecedented quality of image for a budget microscope. DIPLE (prototype version 2019) for observing human blood cells - Photo courtesy of Istituto Italiano di TecnologiaHere is the first feedback from our beta-testers:The conceptAfter the great success of the BLIPS kits, our team needed something to get deeper into the microworld. DIPLE is the answer - a completely NEW CONCEPT, to overcome the limits of Blips for microscopic inspection at a smaller scale.We’ve come back to Kickstarter after three years of development and we can’t wait to bring our community a new view of the world.  Key featuresLIGHT, COMPACT, AND PORTABLE: The whole DIPLE system can be taken anywhere. Measuring in at 17,6cm length, 10cm width and 4cm in height, it’s actually smaller than the box your smartphone came in!EXTREMELY POWERFUL: You can clearly see cellular details, and even bacteria! Thanks to its great optical power, you can digitally zoom the image for achieving an overall MAGNIFICATION OF 1000X before getting any pixelation (with optical resulution below 1 micron).UNIVERSAL: FOR ANY SMARTPHONEOBJECTIVE LENS: Unlike other products, having the objective lens separate to the phone camera ensures an easier way to find the ideal focal distance, even for EXTRA THIN samples (e.g. blood cells). It also means that it does not depend on the shape of your phone, so it works with all types.IMMERSION MICROSCOPY: The flat surfaces of the magnifying objective lenses can work when immersed in transparent liquids.MODULAR: This means that you can upgrade your system in the future, getting new single spare parts, or use it for your own optical improvements.DURABLE: The innovative objective lens of DIPLE is made with metal, meaning the objective lens can drop from 10 meters (33 ft) without issue.NO FUSS:  To keep set up as simple hassle free as possible, you don’t need to remove your phone / tablet case as you would with other productsEXTRA-FINE REGULATION (SUB-MICRON) OF THE FOCAL DISTANCE: A purposefully designed mechanical system allows you to move toward or away from your sample with extreme precision, always obtaining the perfect focus. ORIGINAL DESIGN: The patent pending design is unique, you do not have to add or clamp anything to the body of your phone.CARRYING BOX: It’s not just a container, but a functional part of the product. It is the mechanical support for all the components when you are using the product.AFFORDABLE PRICE: How many portable microscopes allowing you to see bacteria are sold at about 100USD? Nauplii (young forms) of Artemia salina, a tiny crustacean (0,5 mm) - Thanks to the Aquarium of Genoa - the largest aquarium in Europe - for providing us with the samples

 People who love DIPLE  Find your perfect DIPLEThere are three versions of DIPLE objective lenses for microscopy in transmitted light + the new DIPLE LUX for exploring the microscopic details of opaque surfaces.  DIPLE RED, providing 35x REAL magnifications - resolution of 3 micron, field of view of around 1 mm - to see cells, microorganisms (protozoans, rotifers, water bears...);DIPLE GREY, providing 75x REAL magnifications - resolution of 1 micron - to see bacteria, cells, protozoans…DIPLE BLACK, providing 150x REAL magnifications - resolution of 0,7/0,8 micron - to see cell details, bacteria…These values must then be multiplied by the digital zoom of your device, allowing for magnification of even more than 1000x (without pixelation) and the ability to see details of less than 1 micron (1/1000 mm) in size.DIPLE LUX is made up of a DIPLE objective lens, plus a compact EXTRA LIGHT SOURCE for lateral illumination of the samples; a new system specifically designed to work on opaque subjects to observe the tiniest details of their surfaces, out of the DIPLE box.This version of DIPLE has been released during the Kickstarter campaign for responding the requests of many backers that asked for a DIPLE model to check microscopic details of thick, or non-transparent samples. DIPLE LUX has a light source connected to the objective tile and it does not need to be attached to the phone; these two features make DIPLE LUX a product compatible with all the phone models. Here you can see the current product and the original prototype.DIPLE LUX on a banknote of 10 Euro
 Diple Lux on a microfiber clothDIPLE Lux  on cardboardHow DIPLE worksDIPLE is a compact and portable box containing a light source, a stage for samples/microscope, slides and a sturdy metal plate with an optical system.It’s straightforward to use, just lay your phone or tablet over the box, focusing the camera into the lighting hole. With the help of a magnetic guide, the objective lens and light source are automatically placed in the proper position. Back of the DIPLE Grey objective - on the top part you can see the magnetic guide.
 Stage typesThere are two different sample stages for you to pick from:The standard stage: a simple mechanical support for your samples, where you can shift your slide manually for scanning your sample under the DIPLE lens.( DIPLE ITEMS WITH STANDARD STAGE ARE READY TO SHIP, RIGHT NOW! )ORThe fine stage: the slide can be shifted by mechanical screws, for a precise search of microscopic targets. The box has lateral V-shaped apertures, for allowing an easy handling of the samples, or for scanning slides over a large field. What you can see with DIPLEThere are loads of reasons for using DIPLE, whether you're using it for research, learning, or just to see more of the world! From the observation of microorganisms or cells to mineralogy and materials science, with DIPLE, anyone can observe the microworld in detail and save it directly to your phone, in high definition. Here are some ideas for what you could use it for:1. See your own blood cells Blood samples - Taken with DIPLE Grey and BlackTake a tiny drop of blood and smear it on a plain glass slide. You should see only a light pink shadow. Cover it with a thin transparent plastic foil. Observe it like a standard prepared slide. You should process these cells with staining and fixing steps to get them to stay on the glass for a long time, and keep the red color. However, you are able to see the fresh cells for some minutes after their deposition even without more complex procedures.In this short video you will see how to conduct this experiment to see your own red blood cells. In case you wanted to replicate this experiment please be careful: work in a proper environment and use only sterile lancets. 2. Micro-organismsCollect some moss, keeping its roots in tact and with the dirt on, and place the sample in a small container, with a little water. Let it rest in the water for 1-2 days, in a warm climate. Take a drop of dirty water from the moss and put it on a glass slide. Take your 35x objective (in some cases also 75x will work fine) and lay it on the water. The objective can work in immersion, i.e. in direct contact with the water, or you can lay a plastic foil upon the liquid sample to keep it thin. Scan the sample under the objective, until you see some micro-organisms moving around, then you can zoom in to watch them in detail. When you've finished your observations, clean the objective lens with a wet tissue. Rotifer filmed on DIPLE Grey3. BacteriaCreate your own colony of bacteria by placing a mixture of nutrients (the most common is agar agar, usually mixed with meat broth) in a petri dish. Then, you can help the colonies grow by swabbing a place rich in bacteria like your mouth, your hands, or a handful of dirt and then swabbing the bacteria on the petri dish together with the nutrients. After doing this, you need to close the dish to avoid contamination and put it in a warm, safe place. After a few days (or, in some cases, even a few hours), you will get a nice collection of bacteria colonies, ready to be observed in detail. Yogurt bacteria with DIPLE Grey on Samsung A50
4. Engine exhaust observationEngine exhaust samples - Taken with DIPLE Grey and BlackThe particulate matter emitted by many car engines can be observed on DIPLE. In this video you will see this simple test, conducted by our team. We put a plain microscope slide near the exhaust tube of a car, stepped on the gas and then observed the result on our DIPLE set. The result is outstanding. 

 
 Actual magnification Most low-budget microscopes declare false or exaggerated magnifications; see this comparison between DIPLE Red, the version which provides the lower magnification (35x REAL magnifications, multiplied by digital zoom) and a standard USB microscope (with maximum declared magnification 1000x, according to the manufacturer). In this video the two microscopes examine the same prepared slide, a botanical section. You will notice that there is a huge difference in detail, quality of the image, and definition.  HOW to use DIPLE - set up in SECONDSIn this short video tutorial we show how to use DIPLE, with Standard Stage:And here you can see a tutorial of DIPLE with Fine Stage:

After two years of experience with Nybble, we foresee the following risks and are working hard to mitigate them. <br/> <br/><strong>* Supply chain, cash flow, and inventory management</strong><br/>Any delay in the supply chain could halt production at any stage. We try to solve this by carefully estimating the lead time and divide sequential dependency into parallel processes, and moving the most challenging tasks to our top priority. </p><p>This time we include batteries to avoid users' confusion in picking the right ones. However, the production for 2S Li-ion batteries requires an MOQ of 5000 units. It's a sizeable one-time investment, and the storage of many batteries is also risky. We will rent a dedicated room to store the batteries. We will also optimize the production process to reduce the lagging period between stocking and shipping the batteries. </p><p><strong>* Certificates and international shipping </strong><br/>Bittle needs to go through several standard tests for importing and exporting certifications. The tests may take up to two months after we send the final products. We took the advice from our experienced manufacturers that the specifications should not be too exceptional. We will reserve Bittle's full dynamic potential to make it a more stable product. </p><p>The breakout of COVID-19 is adding another layer of uncertainty for production and shipping. The factories are subject to close should any case was reported in the area. The international couriers are also having a hard time arranging oversea shipments. There may be a longer wait time between our shipping date and the delivery on your side. <br/> <br/>We will ship Bittles worldwide through international couriers that can provide reliable tracking. Backers will be responsible for paying customs and duties. The amount varies by country or region. We may have a few customers canceling their orders if the fees upon delivery are too high.

You could also inject artificial intelligence capabilities by mounting a Raspberry Pi or other AI chips through wired/wireless connections.Ball tracking with an intelligent camera mounted on the head Bittle is the second product of OpenCat, sibling of Nybble. Backed by a worldwide user group, you can find many tutorials and project ideas on the Internet. We make constant but tiny progresses every day. You can follow our social media (Instagram/Twitter @PetoiCamp) to get more frequent updates than newsletters. By posting on our forum, you can contribute to the community or simply make your wishes heard. We are always drawing the blueprint for futuristic robots!  Self-righting after falling from a slope (triggered by an infrared remote) Bittle is a palm-sized robot that moves with four legs rather than wheels. Legged motion gives it more freedom to navigate unstructured terrains, and expresses the joy of life whenever it moves. Such dynamic maneuverability was only seen on a few luxury robots from the best labs or tycoon companies previously, such as Boston Dynamics Spot or Sony Aibo. We came up with a grassroots solution to simplify the system to make it affordable and mass-producible. Walk the dog. Click the image to see a longer clip. Bittle is a compact system of five major components: body frame, actuator, electronics, battery, and the software to coordinate all the hardware to perform varied tasks. Body frameWe designed Bittle's interlocking frame as a 3D puzzle with very few screws involved. Most body parts are symmetric for simplicity and aesthetics. Puzzle-like body frame. Click the image for the full assembling animation.It's a pleasure to assemble and disassemble Bittle for teaching or maintenance. On average, it takes about one hour to put together the body from scratch. Build a robot dog on your own!Each piece has gone through tens of iterations with 3D printing. We then use high strength injection-molded plastic to provide the best protection from collision and dust (it's NOT waterproof!). In the stress tests, the assembled robot can take an adult's stepping without breaking any components (do NOT try this at home!).   Rolling down a step. Click the image for the full review video.We also designed Bittle to be soft. Besides the elasticity of the material, the spring-loaded upper legs flatten the shock on joint servos to protect their gears. Bittle usually survives regular collisions. In the extreme cases, it will disintegrate at the designated ""weak link in the chain"", which is easy and cheap to reinstall or replace. Passive compliant jointsWe designed the frame to be compatible with most 9g servos. You could order the ""Bittle Shell"" perk alone to compile your spare servos into a beautiful action figure!ActuatorWe visited several servo manufacturers and iterated many times to find the optimized parameters. It will be model P1S, a slim, fast servo with a controllable angle of 270 degrees.P1S servoWe use nine P1S servos to actuate Bittle. Eight of them are for walking joints, and one is for head panning. We will also include one spare servo for replacement, as brushed motors are consumable after a certain period of wearing. You may order the ""Bittle Servo Set"" perk if you expect to use Bittle intensively for teaching or researching.ElectronicsBittle is driven by NyBoard V1, a customized Arduino board with rich peripherals. We fully utilized the chip of a regular Arduino Uno to coordinate sophisticated motions. The board can drive at least 12 PWM servos, and an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) is used for balancing. It stores ""muscle memory"" and detects body status (orientation and acceleration) for balancing. We provide an infrared remote to trigger basic movements. The board also listens to string commands from the serial port, such as ""walk"", ""sit"", or more detailed instructions for individual joints. NyBoard V1NyBoard V1 is a revision of NyBoard V0 that has been driving 2000 Nybbles all over the world. We continue to provide a 2x5 socket on NyBoard V1 for mounting Raspberry Pi. It powers the Pi and communicates with it through the serial or I2C network. The Pi gives Bittle the ability to analyze more sensory data, get connected to the Internet, and make decisions by itself. Due to Bittle's small size, it best fits Pi Zero and Pi 3A+. For larger Pi models, you will need to tilt the Pi and 3D print some supporting structures. Raspberry Pi 3 A+ and Pi camera on BittleThanks to the Arduino and Raspberry Pi community, you can find many customization ideas for Bittle. There are four Seeed Grove sockets on NyBoard V1 for extensible modules. To make installation easier, we designed Bittle's head as a clip to bite on those modules. That explains why we created a dog out of OpenCat this time. There's also a screw hole inside Bittle's head for fixing additional modules. Extensible modulesWe developed a Bluetooth dongle for wirelessly uploading codes and controlling Bittle from PC or smartphone Apps. We also developed a WiFi dongle for wirelessly communicating with Bittle. You can play with Bittle without messing around with cables. Wireless is also essential when you are studying balancing related motion planning. You can even utilize the computational power of a remote ""brain"" without being constrained by Bittle's size and cargo capacity. The dongles are compatible with our previous Nybble model. Bluetooth and WiFi donglesFurthermore, we are developing an ESP32 development board with native Bluetooth and WiFi connectivity. We have made a functional beta version called the ""BiBoard V0"" perk for developers. We expect a considerable performance boost, and you are welcome to join our exploration.BiBoard V0SoftwareBittle is driven by our OpenCat code. It has 3K lines of Arduino codes excluding 3rd party libraries. It defines the minimal data structure and algorithms for performing quadruped motion. We also provide example commander and parser in Python so that you can send instructions from other devices. The code is already running on thousands of small quadruped robots, including many variants of OpenCat.  The OpenCat codes are open source on GithubYou can program Bittle at different levels in various coding environments, such as C in Arduino IDE and Python in the terminal. We are collaborating with TinkerGen, a STEM education company that kindly developed Codecraft (a graphical coding environment) for Bittle. They will also provide a free curriculum for you to learn programming in Codecraft and create a wide array of educational and fun projects with it! You can code in Arduino IDE, Python, Codecraft, and many other environmentsWe plan to refactor Bittle's code between the production and release it before Bittle's delivery. You may start to explore the current OpenCat repository on GitHub to get familiar with the framework. We will announce new community challenges with huge prizes in the community section!    Bittle climbing up a step under realtime instructions sent through BluetoothBatteryWe designed a Li-ion battery pack with a built-in charging and protection circuit. It can slide into the track underneath Bittle and tune its center of mass. It can power Bittle for at least one hour of continuous walking. It also has an RGB LED to indicate the battery's status.Li-ion battery with onboard charging and protection circuitWith the slide-in installation mechanism and an anti-reverse plug, it's not too hard to switch batteries. You may order extra batteries for uninterrupted researching or playing. With some reconfiguration, it can also power our previous Nybble models.You can check this 30-min interview by Hackster.io for all the cool features.  Bittle is a perfect example to show ""small is big"". We wanted to encourage people to free their creativity and make wonderful things from limited resources. We have a growing community since the release of the OpenCat demo. We have @petoicamp on social media to update our fans about the progress of the project. After the launch of Nybble, we built the forum on our site (petoi.com) to discuss the project, showcase DIY models, and add function modules. Petoi Camp, the OpenCat forumLooking back at all the challenges we went through, the community was the most significant support that encouraged us to continue. We got thousands of backers to bring Nybble to life. Fans all around the world volunteered to translate our documentation into their languages. And many developers added new features to OpenCat. We cannot wait to see what Bittle will bring to us!   An Android App (Code&Robots) developed by one of our fansTo make our community more productive, educational, and rewarding, we will launch an online challenge for all OpenCat users. You can find our proposed rules in this forum post and give suggestions before it officially starts. In short, we will define several tasks that can be measured quantitatively, e.g., programing Bittle to get onto the highest step. You have to both demo your solution and teach others to validate your entry. On the first day of each month, we will announce the world's record-breaker and gift a free Bittle or Nybble to the winner!Who will be the first Bittle backflipper and enter our Hall of Fame?Bittle standing on my fingersBittle is 20cm x 11cm x 11cm in dimension. It weighs less than 280g but can carry up to 450g cargo under its belly. With proper programming and calibration, It can run faster than two body lengths per second. Bittle can remember tens of instinctive motion patterns and can perform more fancy tricks with realtime instructions.  Bittle (250g) trotting with an iron cargo (465g)P1S servo uses a coreless motor, alloy gears, ball bearing, and plastic case. It's 8.4V compatible, high speed, and has a controllable range of 270 degrees.  Bittle on a treadmillNyBoard V1 has an Atmega328P with 16MHz CPU, 2K SRAM, and 32K flash. We also added an 8K I2C EEPROM, an IMU, a servo driver for 12 PWM servos, an infrared receiver, and a buzzer. It has a 2x5 socked to mount on a Raspberry Pi. BiBoard V0 has an ESP32 with 240MHz dual-core CPU, 520KB SRAM, and up to 16M flash. It has built-in WiFi/Bluetooth, 12 PWM servo pins, an IMU, an infrared receiver, an audio amplifier, and a speaker. It has several communication ports to connect to other devices.  The Bluetooth dongle is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Android. It can also work on IOS with some auxiliary software. It can be used for uploading Arduino sketch or communicating with the NyBoard. The WiFi module can host a simple WebUI and communicate with the NyBoard. BiBoard V0, NyBoard V1 with Raspberry Pi 3 A+, and NyBoard V1 with a Bluetooth dongleThe intelligent camera module is our ODMed product. It integrates multiple vision recognition algorithms running on its ESP32 dual-core processor. It can return recognized human body, objects, and symbols through serial/I2C/WiFi at a rate of 25fps or 50fps. It can even stream video through WiFi. We will also include a deck of symbol cards. You can refer to this link for more information.Intelligent camera module and the symbol deckWe have been residing in the factory for six months and commit to staying until we start to ship Bittles.     Spark Erosion Machining (EDM) for making precise moldsWe have finished 95% percent of the injection molds of the body frame. The lead time for injection production is one week. More funds are required to make the mold for the optional silicone tail and paws. The lead time is one month. We will provide their 3D printing files if they cannot catch up in time. We are still optimizing the parameters of servos for longer life-span. The lead time is at least two months. NyBoard V1 and battery are production-ready, and the suppliers are waiting for down payments for mass production. The lead time is 45 days to 50 days. We also need to design a sturdy and compact packaging box for international shipping. The lead time is one month. OpenCat started as the founder Rz Li's pet project in 2016. After the demo video went viral in 2018, he devoted all his time and resources to bring this sophisticated and cute robot to the public. He founded Petoi and successfully crowdfunded the Nybble project in 2018. All the earnings have been put into the fulfillment of Nybble and the R&D of Bittle.We are still fulfilling Nybble orders for a worldwide audienceOur mission is to bring affordable robotic pets from fiction to reality. We grew from a single maker to a company that can collaborate and negotiate with manufacturers to get the best solutions to our needs. We have many more cool ideas in mind, and Bittle is another small step towards our ideal shape of household robots.Nybble and BittleYou can help to bring this project to life by backing a wide selection of perks. The main perk for this campaign is the Bittle kit. Bittle kit (the final contents are subject to change)You can pick your base perk, then choose your add-on items during checkout. You will also need to pay the shipping of your base perk during checkout. We will cover the increased shipping fees of add-on items as a discount. We will ship your packages from our Chinese factory with reliable international couriers. Your government will collect the customs tax/fees upon delivery. Note: It can be expensive for some countries and areas. We are very grateful for your support and hope to bring you a unique product ASAP!Dr. Rongzhong Li (Rz)         Founder and CEORz is a physics PhD and computer science master. He previously taught computer science at Wake Forest University.Rz is a maker with broad interests in art, literature, and science. He started the OpenCat project in 2016 and successfully launched Nybble in 2018.

He has been running various STEM camps over the past five years.Len likes to try out new electronic products and excels in remembering their parameters. He designed the variant PCBs and communication modules to make Bittle more extensible and user friendly.Kai Mai         AdvisorKai is an alumnus of UC Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon University(CMU). He served as the chapter president of Berkeley & CMU alumni network in Shanghai and is the co-president of the Berkeley Chinese Alumni International Association, Silicon Valley Chapter.  He was the VP of Engineering for ALO7, a leading English language learning education technology company in China.Kai has rich experiences and expertise in startup bootstrapping/fundraising/scaling and project/product/engineering management.  He helps supervise Petoi's management and development.Hardware products are especially ""hard"" to deliver compared to pure software products. After two years of experience with Nybble, we foresee the following risks and are working hard to mitigate them.  * Supply chain, cash flow, and inventory managementAny delay in the supply chain could halt production at any stage. We try to solve this by carefully estimating the lead time and divide sequential dependency into parallel processes, and moving the most challenging tasks to our top priority. This time we include batteries to avoid users' confusion in picking the right ones. However, the production for 2S Li-ion batteries requires an MOQ of 5000 units. It's a sizeable one-time investment, and the storage of many batteries is also risky. We will rent a dedicated room to store the batteries. We will also optimize the production process to reduce the lagging period between stocking and shipping the batteries. * Certificates and international shipping Bittle needs to go through several standard tests for importing and exporting certifications. The tests may take up to two months after we send the final products. We took the advice from our experienced manufacturers that the specifications should not be too exceptional. We will reserve Bittle's full dynamic potential to make it a more stable product. The breakout of COVID-19 is adding another layer of uncertainty for production and shipping. The factories are subject to close should any case was reported in the area. The international couriers are also having a hard time arranging oversea shipments. There may be a longer wait time between our shipping date and the delivery on your side.  We will ship Bittles worldwide through international couriers that can provide reliable tracking. Backers will be responsible for paying customs and duties. The amount varies by country or region. We may have a few customers canceling their orders if the fees upon delivery are too high. So we want to make sure everyone knows about the shipping policy before they order. * Team developmentWe currently have two people working full-time on the project. We managed to push it to the current stage and will scale up the team in time for the massive amount of work towards fulfilling your orders.",41.0,0,"2 Campaigns

An optional AI chip, such as Raspberry Pi can be mounted on top of Nybble's back, to help Nybble with perception and decision. You can program in your favorite language, and direct Nybble walk around simply by sending short commands, such as ""walk"" or ""turn left""!Follow the instructions, or don’t.You can check the most current tutorial. We also have a tutorial playlist with detailed instructions.Stick with the included software, find hacks and customizations from the worldwide community, or push the envelope and write your own mods.Think up your own look and bring it to life with paint, craft supplies, 3D printing, or whatever else feels right.Join our growing community on our website www.petoi.com, make friends, challenge each other and each other’s kittens.WOW! Look at all the press our little kitten has gotten! TechCrunch! IEEE Spectrum! Steemhunt! MagPi!  We are also very grateful to Indiegogo for helping us reach our goal and featuring us in their newsletter! Features3D puzzle frameNybble's frame is an easily assemble-able puzzle. The wooden frame is a retro design in honor of its popstick framed ancestor. The wisdom of traditional Chinese woodwork was borrowed to make the major frame screw-free. Detailed assembling instructions will be available. Or...challenge yourself and try to solve the puzzle on your own!NyBoardWe have designed an all-in-one controller we call the NyBoard V0 to ease the wiring and future development. Besides the ATmega328P chip (the same one on Arduino Uno), we used a faster crystal and added external EEPROM for storing more instincts. It has on-board power management with tunable output, various communication and controlling ports, and an optimized layout.We pushed the layout precision to 0.25mm, to fit the geometry not only for Nybble, but also for Raspberry Pi and your favorite extension boards. It was designed to avoid all the tall components on Pi that may conflict with installation. Its 2x5 communication socket accepts the pins on Pi. It powers Pi, listens to Pi, and there’s a jumper switch for changing I2C master. If you have another preferred chip to ATmega328P, just take full control of the board! The on-board chip can still watch the battery level for you. You do need to design an installation mount if the optional screw holes don’t match your board. By attaching a Pi or other AI chips, you will be able to add more talents to Nybble, make it listen, see, and think.We upgraded NyBoard V0 to NyBoard V1_0 with better connectivity and stability, and started to ship them in January 2021,We also include Bluetooth and WiFi dongles in the standard Nybble kit. You can program and control Nybble wirelessly, free from the cables!Joint tunerNybble is adorable, but it’s still a precise instrument. To make it walk, it takes patience and precision. To help you through the challenges, we also include a nice gadget, the “L” tuner for calibrating your Nybble at times. Just turn Nybble to calibration mode and align the observation windows, type proper calibrations, and Nybble will remember them at once.Learn programming with NybbleAfter assembling Nybble, some entry-level computer skills are required to upload the code and tune Nybble to walking order. You'll need a little willingness to learn and teach it new tricks! The bigger picture behind NybbleOver the 2.5 years’ evolution of OpenCat, a rough framework is becoming clearer. It started from a Raspberry Pi kit, introduced an Arduino as the central pattern generator, and will accept any extensions that are needed. As long as you have a precise and powerful actuator, you can scale Nybble up to a dog, a horse, or even an elephant!Check out our GitHub repository at https://github.com/PetoiCamp/OpenCat and you're invited to build it together!Nybble is for everyone!  If you like graceful cats, tiny computers, hackable software, customizable models, or connecting with new friends around the world, back this project!If you’re flying solo and just want to enjoy making Nybble yours, you can hack, reprogram, paint, decorate and pose your Nybble in any way you can imagine.  If you’re looking for a fun and meaningful group project for your family or classroom, this tiny kitten brings out the best in people, unlocking curiosity and joy.We know that with Nybble, we can break the barrier between those million-dollar quadruped robots and individual makers. Nybble will also be less intimidating to kids who want to learn about robotics, programming, and making in general.Impressed with Boston Dynamics robots? Why not try Nybble first? As in 2021 Summer, We have a better inventory management and are keep shipping out Nybbles! Nybble is a small step that an individual maker takes to overcome obstacles and bring his creation to the world. Nybble is also a bridge to fuse cool technologies and connect the developers around it. Your support will define Nybble's future!There's a more technical post on Hackster.io on the code release:https://www.hackster.io/RzLi/petoi-nybble-944867We need your help! Nybble can accomplish great things if given the freedom to do so. This is a one-time investment with a worldwide community always adding its values.By starting out on Indiegogo, we’re avoiding a lot of the problems that companies usually have when they start something new. We are highly interested in your feedback on how you train Nybble, how you customize your kitten, and how you hack it!We don’t want to tell you what Nybble is. You tell us.Indiegogo is also a platform that reaches many different kinds of people with varying interests. In order to get a full assessment of what Nybble can do and what it can become, we need everyone to pitch in and give their feedback. From the highest levels of engineering to the youngest kids playing with Nybble, we can't wait to see the outcome!We would like to scale up production, bring down manufacturing costs with higher order volumes and smarter processes. The more Nybbles find a home, the more affordable we can make our kits!Below is a snapshot of the Nybble kit. Nothing special, right? Note some parts may subject to change as I finalize every bit, such as color, length, and the number of screws.Parts not included are 2 x 14500 3.7 V Li-ion batteries and a smart charger. Be careful with fake batteries that claim more than 850mAh capacity. I've been using EBL 14500 3.7V 800mAh batteries and they work well. If you are out of the US and find a working battery in your area, please share your knowledge with our community! More sets of batteries will allow you to play longer with Nybble by swapping. I usually keep programming all night with one pair of batteries, but they would die out quickly if you just play with Nybble as a remote-controlled toy.Rongzhong (Rz) LiFounder and CEORz is a physics PhD and computer science master.

From small devices such as a smart phone to a large device such as an airplane, everything is connected to the internet today. It is estimated that there will be more than to 21 billion IoT devices by 2025. How cool is it to develop an IoT project in less than 10 minutes?You might wonder whether it's really possible. Yes, have have developed  a tiny computer called Magicbit which can be programmed to create different innovative applications easily by anyone.It's a STEM tool, DIY builder, learning aid and a platform for creative thinkers.  Magicbit has a development environment with cloud based IoT platform called Magicblocks and a mobile app which can be seamlessly connected for to create innovative solutions.  Magicbit is packed with a wide of feature range. It has an ESP32 module in it's core together with sensors, actuators and connectivity modules built in. The idea is to minimize the additional components required when developing solutions. This makes the life easy, even for a beginner.  We remove the barriers of entry for a newbie to electronics with pluggable modules and built in features. So there's no need of jumper wires, breadboards and soldering to develop an application. Programming is another hurdle for a beginner in innovation. Our visual code builder with block programming enables everyone to develop a solution even without programming knowledge.  Therefore it's easy to use and fast to learn.  If you are an expert in coding and electronics we have plenty of options in Magicbit which you can find as you scroll down.  Magicbit is  made for EVERYONE. Students and kids can use it as a STEM tool to learn innovation with technology in a practical way. Developers and researches can use it to capture data and prototype solutions. Hobbyists can use Magicbit to find solutions for problems they are keen to solve in the world.   As we introduce Magicbit as a STEM tool, we carefully designed it to be friendly for children.  Magicbit is not operating alone. While we have our own cloud based software -Magicblocks, we made Magicbit cross compatible with  all popular platforms out there. For example if you are familiar with Arduino or MicroPython, you can program in the same way using Magicbit. It works like Magic with other cloud platforms too. Which means you can try out real world applications with any cloud platform you like.  Magicblocks.io is a cloud based IoT platform we developed with inbuilt device manager and visual code builder based on Node-RED.  This hides the complexity of hardware, firmware and protocols. We want to encourage innovators to focus on logic and creativity.The platform supports to learn basic concepts more quickly with a simplified learning process ( i.e - 10 minutes to develop a simple application). However this has the capability to build complex applications with hardware,  customized coding and third party integrations.  Best part is we have made it FREE for everyone for learning purposes.  Have you ever thought of the number of sensors in your smart phone?  Magicblocks mobile app brings the inbuilt sensors and the capabilities of the mobile phone to the solution development environment of Magicbit. This enables to get sensor data from the phone and use the phone as an input or an output device.1. Using sensors and input data from mobile - GPs, accelerometer, gyroscope, compass, light , proximity, camera, temperature, pressure2. Using mobile as an output device - Push notification  Again best part is it's also made FREE for anyone to use. You can download it from google play store and our iOS version is under development.   Not only IoT, Magicbit is a single platform to learn and practice any area below.Internet of Things ( IoT) : Develop IoT applications and automations  in minutes with web/mobile dashboards.Computer programming : Programming is more fun with a hardware platform. Practice coding with C, Python or Scratch.Robotics : Master the basics of Robotics  such as obstacle avoiding, line following and WiFi & Bluetooth control.Electronics : Learn the basics of electronics with digital I/O, analog I/O, communications etc.   Now, let's think for a moment. With a platform with all these features what can you possibly do? You will be amazed, if you do a quick search on the internet, to see the number of applications you  can do with all these futures. Actually it's LIMITLESS.Let's see few example applications done with Magicbit.Plant wateringAutomate watering your plants based on soil moisture.  Pet FeederFeed your pets remotely using mobile. Phone and Arm movementUse your mobile as an input device for projects. Create Games  Try out fun projects you see on the internet. Pulse Oximeter Monitor oxygen level in blood using your own device. Robots Build different types of awesome robots.  As students, we also used popular platforms to develop solutions. While all the competitive products in the market helped us to inspire to develop our own platform, we developed Magicbit specifically to address issues we all have like low features, cross compatibility problems, need to buy different modules for applications, difficulty for use for a beginners and the cost.Magicbit standout with ease of use and cost effectiveness when compared with others.  Below front and back layouts gives the picture of the composition of features on board.  Pluggable Modules in Magicbit Pro Kit. Our team has been dedicated to create quality content free for learners. From setting up to practical implementation, everything is available in our website. New projects are created frequently by Magicbit community and updated in the website. Student projects done with Magicbit are documented in commonly known platforms such as hackster.io.You can check every project with details in websites. YouTube channel provides constant updates to give creative ideas for everyone interested.  Magicbit Indiegogo perks are priced with great discounts for the early supporters of Magicbit.  After the pilot product launch, We have received numerous achievements in education and community service sector in Sri Lanka. Below awards are yet another proof of the powerful design and concept of Magicbit.  Project Magicbit was realized with the support of many private and government organizations across the world.  You can find our projects and articles available on popular tech and news sites.  Our journey started 2 years back and we will be sending out Indiegogo perks from November 2021 onwards. While there are many who contributed for the success of Magicbit. It's a project started by three friends.   Magicbit has been developed with over a period of 2 years, by testing out different prototypes . After our beta launch in September 2020, we improved Magicbit with every production batch. We have sold about 500 units in the local market in Sri Lanka.Since the Magicbit design is tested and used, we can guarantee that this is merely not a prototype but a robust product.    Your support means a lot to us.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is B. Sharise Moore. I am an educator, born and raised in New Jersey. I now reside in Baltimore, MD. I am currently a certified 6th grade English/Language Arts teacher with 11 years of classroom teaching experience. I am also an author.  My short stories and poetry have been published in anthologies and literary magazines such as <i>The City</i> and <i>Fiyah Literary Magazine</i>. My forthcoming YA magical realism novel, <i>Dr. Marvellus Djinn's Odd Scholars </i>will be published by MV Media in early fall, 2020.  I am currently pursuing an MS in Curriculum and Instruction with a focus in Writing for Young Adults and Children at McDaniel College. I also host Moore Books with B. Sharise, a diverse book reviewing channel on Youtube. </p>
<p>I've always been fascinated by curriculum and materials of instruction. As a speculative writer and educator, I'd like to combine two of my passions: Afrofuturism and education. Ytasha L. Womack, author of <i>Afrofuturism: The World of Black Sci-fi and Fantasy Culture, </i> describes<strong> Afrofuturism</strong> as ""an intersection of imagination, technology, the future, and liberation."" The <i>Conjuring Worlds</i> textbook will feature original works (short stories, poetry, non-fiction articles, and artwork) commissioned from Black creators. Each work will be accompanied by extension activities appropriate for middle school students. <i>Conjuring Worlds </i>will be an interdisciplinary teaching tool, with activities covering subjects across the curriculum.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Why This? Why Now?</strong></h3>
<p>Why not? M.D. Anderson states the following in <i>The Radical Self-Reliance of Black Homeschooling, </i>“the homeschooling population in the United States is predominantly white and concentrated in suburban or rural areas. In 2016, black children accounted for 8 percent of the 1.7 million homeschooled students nationally, according to U.S. Department of Education statistics."" As the risks of COVID 19 remain and distrust/disappointment/ disillusionment in the public school system continues, homeschool collectives continue to search for more inclusive, diverse, and easy to use teaching tools and instructional materials. <i>Conjuring Worlds</i> can become a go-to tool for homeschoolers, educators, and parents with a desire to feed the vast imaginations of their students and children. </p>
<p> </p>

My name is B. Sharise Moore. I am an educator, born and raised in New Jersey. I now reside in Baltimore, MD. I am currently a certified 6th grade English/Language Arts teacher with 11 years of classroom teaching experience. I am also an author.  My short stories and poetry have been published in anthologies and literary magazines such as The City and Fiyah Literary Magazine. My forthcoming YA magical realism novel, Dr. Marvellus Djinn's Odd Scholars will be published by MV Media in early fall, 2020.  I am currently pursuing an MS in Curriculum and Instruction with a focus in Writing for Young Adults and Children at McDaniel College. I also host Moore Books with B. Sharise, a diverse book reviewing channel on Youtube. 
I've always been fascinated by curriculum and materials of instruction. As a speculative writer and educator, I'd like to combine two of my passions: Afrofuturism and education. Ytasha L. Womack, author of Afrofuturism: The World of Black Sci-fi and Fantasy Culture,  describes Afrofuturism as ""an intersection of imagination, technology, the future, and liberation."" The Conjuring Worlds textbook will feature original works (short stories, poetry, non-fiction articles, and artwork) commissioned from Black creators. Each work will be accompanied by extension activities appropriate for middle school students. Conjuring Worlds will be an interdisciplinary teaching tool, with activities covering subjects across the curriculum.
 
Why This? Why Now?
Why not? M.D. Anderson states the following in The Radical Self-Reliance of Black Homeschooling, “the homeschooling population in the United States is predominantly white and concentrated in suburban or rural areas. In 2016, black children accounted for 8 percent of the 1.7 million homeschooled students nationally, according to U.S. Department of Education statistics."" As the risks of COVID 19 remain and distrust/disappointment/ disillusionment in the public school system continues, homeschool collectives continue to search for more inclusive, diverse, and easy to use teaching tools and instructional materials. Conjuring Worlds can become a go-to tool for homeschoolers, educators, and parents with a desire to feed the vast imaginations of their students and children. 
 
What We Need
It is important that the writers and artists involved in this project are compensated fairly.  Please see the proposed budget below:
8 Short Stories @ $150 each = $1200
8 poems @ $100 each = $800
6 nonfiction articles @ $100 each = $600
10 works of art @ $150 each= $1500
Cover art = $350
75 hours of labor for curriculum/extension activity creation @$25.00 per hour = $1,875
Lightning Source Print On Demand Set-up Fee: $120.00 (publishing cost)
ISBN & Barcode: $130.00 (publishing cost)
Book Layout= $350.00
Total Cost of Project: $6, 925.00

<h3>My name is Marshall Allen and I am showing Americans how to save big money on health care - and I need your help. </h3>
<p>Our health care system is taking advantage of us financially. Americans spend twice as much per person on health care than the citizens of other developed countries, but still, call its high cost their number one financial concern. Medical bills are overpriced and riddled with errors, but if you can’t pay they still come after you. About 1-in-6 Americans have medical debt in collections. And many are delaying necessary medical care because of the cost.  </p>
<p>I spent 15 years as an investigative journalist, including a decade at ProPublica. I’ve learned that there’s no excuse for these outrageous health care costs. We’re getting hustled. Our health care system is saddling us with overpriced and error-filled bills and the cost of treatment we don’t actually need. The system is wasting our money with its inefficient billing and administrative bloat— and it keeps coming back for more. We’ve trusted the health care industry but it’s actually preying on us financially. </p>

<h3><strong>Bullies Watch Out</strong></h3>
<p>It’s time for us to get engaged and fight back. There is a lot we can do about the problem, but we need to be equipped. My new book, <i>Never Pay the First Bill: And Other Ways to Fight the Health Care System and Win</i>, is a how-to guide to help working Americans and employers save big money by hacking the health care system. The book has been a huge success. I’ve been featured on the national NPR shows 1A and Weekend Edition, Good Morning America, ABC News Live and dozens of podcasts. The book is being called a must-read for every American and now I’m turning it into an engaging series of health care financial literacy videos called <strong><i>The Never Pay Pathway </i></strong><i>(aka NPP)</i>. The topics covered include: How to identify and contest errors and overcharges in your medical bills; how to win insurance company appeals; how to avoid care you don't need; how to use hospital financial assistance policies; how to defend yourself in small claims court and much more!</p>

Children can start having fun right away with the LoCoMotive by creating their unique train tracks using tape. The Color Car then enables them to learn basic code logic, entirely screen-less. Each additional train car adds a new function and is programmable through the LoCoMoGo app, therefore, creating more and more fun opportunities to play and code with. Finally, the LoCoMoGo Train can be extended with many more Train Cars. Each additional Train Car adds a new functionality, enabling more and more fun opportunities to play and code with. With LoCoMoGo there will always be a new car to add to your collection, as we continuously work with you to come up with best ideas to expand the LoCoMoGo experience.  LoCoMoGo's fresh approach to making coding accessible for all has turned heads around the world. For instance, LoCoMoGo has been selected as one of the top-50 most innovative Dutch technology startups to exhibit at CES 2020.  As our world rapidly digitalizes, the skill of programming has become increasingly important.The enormous increase in demand for jobs that require coding skills is a strong sign of that. At LoComogo we believe every child should have the opportunity to learn these important skills. In this, we do not stand alone: research shows that 91% of parents want their children to learn how to code [Google/Gallup, 2015].Unfortunately, there aren't enough teachers with the knowledge to teach children the skills of coding. Educational Technology (EdTech) toys have the potential to be a great way to fill this gap. However, these toys tend to focus entirely on learning how to code first, forgetting the fun-loving nature inherent in every child. As a consequence, kids that don’t already have an affinity to engineering or robotics might miss out on the borderless opportunities brought by coding.Learning should be joyful, and science has proven that children learn best through play [VVOB, 2018]. That is why LoCoMoGo teaches coding through play, because 91% of parents might want their child to learn how to code, but 100% want them to have fun.  At LoCoMoGo we want to inspire the innovators of tomorrow. That is why in naming our train sets we took inspiration from some of the great innovators of the past.All the rewards include a set of conventional electrical insulation tape, so you can start making the track of your dreams right out of the box!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Ejaad is an empowerment project that fosters social change for semi-literate and literate disadvantaged Afghan women and girls by providing economic and educational opportunities.</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to raise funds to build a workshop and learning center in a safe and discreet neighborhood where our artisans can meet and collaborate in making traditional embroidery and have access to personalized learning and education classes.    </p>
<p>With the design help of Architect Without Frontiers (AWF), your funds will go towards building a well-designed, two-story collaborative space. This will consist of an embroidery workshop and storage area, a classroom for literacy, computer classes, and online learning, an office, and a small library. As well there will be a kitchen, bathroom, and rooftop to be used as a place to have tea and gather in the fresh air.</p>
<p>It is important for our artisans to have a collaborative place where they can meet more easily and systems can be better organized. Up until now, the women have been working from their own homes, making meeting together very difficult. Some of our artisans live in rural villages, they will now be able to stay at the center. </p>
<p>It is essential during this time of transition in Afghanistan that our project provides a safe space for the women to embroider, especially now that many are the main income earners for their families. </p>
<p>We wholeheartedly advocate for the rights of women and girls to receive an education.  The Workshop and Learning Center will provide classes for the women and girls with limited education and also for those with higher learning who desire more challenging opportunities. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>It will allow 25 women to realize their goals and aspirations and ultimately impact their families in a positive way. </strong>  </p>
<p>*<i>We also want to acknowledge the difficulties many of our Ejaad families are facing at this particular time of unrest. Over 70% are without an income due to the loss of livelihoods. Part of the donations made will go towards supporting each family.</i></p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>This project is especially important now.  We are a local grassroots social enterprise directly connected to a small, conservative community, which is unlikely to draw attention. Embroidery has always been a valued and acceptable craft for women in Afghan society.  As Afghanistan undergoes change, it is more important than ever to be advocates for education which creates peace, international-mindedness, and understanding.  Even in the darkest times, the education of girls and women will not stop. Let's rise up and stand by what is just and right, and be advocates for women who might not have any opportunities.  </p>

<h3> </h3>
<p>My name is Dossevi Trenou, Founder of Braveheart International, a company offering tutoring and coaching services in both English and French, in subjects ranging from AP/College Calculus and Physics, to Linear Algebra and Conversational English or French.</p>
<ul></ul>
<p>I bring to the table, a record of excellence and achievement as both an Electrical Engineer and a linguist.</p>
<p>My tutoring credentials stem from the impeccable ratings, assessments, and reviews I obtained from leading online learning platforms and institutions. But above all, they boil down to my passion for teaching and the results I have achieved in turning earlier students into eager learners and high-achievers.</p>
<p>This campaign aims at promoting<span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> the enrollment of students with unique learning needs among Braveheart's first clients. <i>W</i></span><i style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""><i>e </i>will match dollar for dollar each contribution of <i>60$ or more  you make, </i>to offer them deep introductory rebates on all </i><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""><i>Braveheart Student and Language Services</i> </span><i style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">payment plans</i><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> from now until September 30th, 2022.</span></p>
<p>Another important goal of this campaign, thanks to the donations a number of you had already made, had been, starting August 25th, to offer<i> 40 hours of joint tutoring sessions in AP/College Calculus BC</i> <i>to anyone who would enroll  </i>to that end on our website at <a href=""http://www.braveheartintl.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.braveheartintl.com</a>. This free tutoring drive ended on Wednesday, September, 15th. </p>
<p>We are now in a position to extend this initiative for a full year year starting Friday October 1st, 2021, to <i>an additional 78 hours of free joint tutoring, </i>by <i>matching dollar for dollar--and topping as necessary-- every  additional 120$ contribution you make to our campaign</i>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p>We are raising 9,000 dollars to enable us to reach our goal of providing <u>deeply discounted one-on-one tutoring to students with unique needs, and free joint tutoring sessions to as many students as possible for a full year starting October 1st 2021.</u></p>
</div><div>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1629318648/ovrm2suhgaa4jezbl7cj.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>What motivates us, is to help our students achieve success and thrive in a world of constant change and learning. We'll work together to get them there, whether they're in <strong>College or High School, or professionals </strong>in need of one-on-one coaching through the rigors of  <strong>Precalculus, Calculus, Algebra, Linear Algebra, and Physics</strong>, or seeking assistance to master <strong>Conversational French or English</strong>.​</p>
<p>Do you or your award recipients need to get to an A in your grades, simply improve weaker scores in these subjects , or are you a student with unique learning needs, who could use some caring, patience, and empathy, or can't you just afford a private tutor like me? In either case, we'll make it work for you. We'll achieve this by carefully guiding your understanding of the most complex topics through the methodical application of reason and logic, and the tools of self-paced learning. Together, we can do it: We've done it again and again with countless of your peers.​</p>
<p>I hold a 'Diplôme d'Ingénieur Électricien' --equivalent to a <strong>Master's Degree in Electrical Engineering</strong>-- from the <strong>French Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble</strong>, and earned tutoring credentials from some of the leading global providers of learning services in the subjects we teach.</p>
<p>In addition to a 30+ year international career as a former Hewlett-Packard (HP, HPE) Chief Technologist, spent architecting advanced IT, Networking, and Telecom systems for the world's leading high-tech companies, I'm an accomplished French/English simultaneous conference interpreter and translator, and an FAA-licensed pilot. But what really defines me at heart, is a passion for teaching and learning, love of music and the Martial Arts--I'm a third degree Black Belt in Taekwondo, and above all, compassion for my fellow human.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><br/>The main risk is for Braveheart not to reach its desired enrollment goals.</p>
<p>However, to get us to the finish line, I will be relying on the following concentric circles of support:</p>
<ul>
<li>An inner circle of friends, relatives, and colleagues whose trust and confidence I will be relying on to carry us through</li>
<li>Backers like you, who are willing to assist in this endeavor and give a winning hand to an anonymous student they support through this initiative</li>
<li>The broader public, which we will reach through word-of-mouth, testimonies, and reviews and the snowballing effect of high achievement</li>
<li>International learners in need of aligning their skills to US standards, and hailing from diverse parts of the world that I had the privilege to discover and appreciate through my travels and life experience</li>
</ul>

My name is Dossevi Trenou, Founder of Braveheart International, a company offering tutoring and coaching services in both English and French, in subjects ranging from AP/College Calculus and Physics, to Linear Algebra and Conversational English or French.

I bring to the table, a record of excellence and achievement as both an Electrical Engineer and a linguist.
My tutoring credentials stem from the impeccable ratings, assessments, and reviews I obtained from leading online learning platforms and institutions. But above all, they boil down to my passion for teaching and the results I have achieved in turning earlier students into eager learners and high-achievers.
This campaign aims at promoting the enrollment of students with unique learning needs among Braveheart's first clients. We will match dollar for dollar each contribution of 60$ or more  you make, to offer them deep introductory rebates on all Braveheart Student and Language Services payment plans from now until September 30th, 2022.
Another important goal of this campaign, thanks to the donations a number of you had already made, had been, starting August 25th, to offer 40 hours of joint tutoring sessions in AP/College Calculus BC to anyone who would enroll  to that end on our website at www.braveheartintl.com. This free tutoring drive ended on Wednesday, September, 15th. 
We are now in a position to extend this initiative for a full year year starting Friday October 1st, 2021, to an additional 78 hours of free joint tutoring, by matching dollar for dollar--and topping as necessary-- every  additional 120$ contribution you make to our campaign.
 
What We Need & What You Get
 
We are raising 9,000 dollars to enable us to reach our goal of providing deeply discounted one-on-one tutoring to students with unique needs, and free joint tutoring sessions to as many students as possible for a full year starting October 1st 2021.

Each 60 dollars of contribution you make before our campaign deadline of Tuesday, September, 21st, will trigger these benefits to you and a new student who contacts us by claiming 'Unique Learning Needs' on the Braveheart website  at braveheartintl.com:

We will match your contribution dollar for dollar with a 120$ rebate towards the first-time purchase by this student of any weekly or monthly one-on-one tutoring plan included in Braveheart's Student and Language services. 
You will be recognized as a Unique Needs Donor on the Braveheart website at the conclusion of this campaign.

Each 120 dollars of contribution you make will trigger the following: 


We will match your contribution dollar for dollar towards the delivery on our platform of 78 hours of joint free weekly tutoring sessions in AP/College Calculus BC, every Friday from October 15th, 2021, to October 14th, 2022.
These sessions will be open to any student who contacts us by claiming 'Free Tutoring' on our website at braveheartintl.com, and joins me and other participants on these weekly Zoom-based calls.
These weekly free joint sessions will be split over 3 half-hours targeted respectively at the EMEA Region including Europe, The Middle East and Africa, The Asia-Pacific, India and China Region, and the Americas Region including North, South America, and the Caribbean islands.

You will be recognized as a Free Calculus Class Donor on the Braveheart website at the conclusion of this campaign.

Regardless of whether or not we reach our stated goal, the benefit of the rewards associated with your contribution will be immediately available for a full year to a student with unique learning needs taking advantage of your generous gesture once they book the corresponding services.
Your action will also benefit for a full year, any student who enrolls on our website at www.braveheartintl.com, to take advantage of our free weekly tutoring sessions starting Friday, October 1st, 2021.

 
The Impact

What motivates us, is to help our students achieve success and thrive in a world of constant change and learning. We'll work together to get them there, whether they're in College or High School, or professionals in need of one-on-one coaching through the rigors of  Precalculus, Calculus, Algebra, Linear Algebra, and Physics, or seeking assistance to master Conversational French or English.​
Do you or your award recipients need to get to an A in your grades, simply improve weaker scores in these subjects , or are you a student with unique learning needs, who could use some caring, patience, and empathy, or can't you just afford a private tutor like me? In either case, we'll make it work for you. We'll achieve this by carefully guiding your understanding of the most complex topics through the methodical application of reason and logic, and the tools of self-paced learning. Together, we can do it: We've done it again and again with countless of your peers.​
I hold a 'Diplôme d'Ingénieur Électricien' --equivalent to a Master's Degree in Electrical Engineering-- from the French Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble, and earned tutoring credentials from some of the leading global providers of learning services in the subjects we teach.
In addition to a 30+ year international career as a former Hewlett-Packard (HP, HPE) Chief Technologist, spent architecting advanced IT, Networking, and Telecom systems for the world's leading high-tech companies, I'm an accomplished French/English simultaneous conference interpreter and translator, and an FAA-licensed pilot. But what really defines me at heart, is a passion for teaching and learning, love of music and the Martial Arts--I'm a third degree Black Belt in Taekwondo, and above all, compassion for my fellow human.

 
Risks & Challenges
The main risk is for Braveheart not to reach its desired enrollment goals.
However, to get us to the finish line, I will be relying on the following concentric circles of support:

An inner circle of friends, relatives, and colleagues whose trust and confidence I will be relying on to carry us through
Backers like you, who are willing to assist in this endeavor and give a winning hand to an anonymous student they support through this initiative
The broader public, which we will reach through word-of-mouth, testimonies, and reviews and the snowballing effect of high achievement
International learners in need of aligning their skills to US standards, and hailing from diverse parts of the world that I had the privilege to discover and appreciate through my travels and life experience

<strong>To protect</strong> the “Laguna de Chacahua National Park” from over-exploitation and over-commercialization by buying a broad quantity of land around the infrastructure of the project and by leaving it untouched, so that it will maintain the existence of the rich local fauna and flora of the area (considering that most of the National Park has been put on sale and sold by some of the locals, but we will get back to that later).</li></ul><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>Who am I and what do I do?</strong></u></h3><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p>My name is Nicolas Genna and I was born in France on 29/05/1979. Yet, I feel like a true citizen of the world after having travelled, lived and worked in 49 different countries for the last 20 years (and for the last 9 years in a row).</p><p>I graduated with a Master's Degree in Physical Education (encompassing professional coaching, group management, sport psychology, and nutrition and health) at the Sports and Sciences University of Nice, France (2000-2004). In addition to my career in Physical Education, I substantially taught English as a second language until 2016 in Mexico (at least in a formal, “official” structure), for I had become a certified teacher of the University of Cambridge's international CELTA program in Amsterdam, in 2011. Furthermore, I have extensively studied and taught in the fields of sustainable development, astrology and astronomy, yoga, Reiki, Chinese medicine, holistic massage and physiotherapy throughout the years. Not only have I worked as a high-school teacher or University Professor in many of these fields in France, The Netherlands, India, Nepal, Japan, Mexico, Ecuador and Peru, but I also have a substantial amount of more “random” professional experience, such as a photographer, a restaurant and bar manager, and even as a professional fisherman and farm manager.</p><p> </p><p>In fact, as I explain substantially in my first book (“Teacher on the Road - The Five Phases of Death”, published in 2020), while most people choose (or are forced to choose) a “career”, supposedly for most of their life, I have always been inexorably drawn towards a multi-disciplinary approach of existence, in an attempt to put all the pieces of the giant cosmic puzzle together so to speak, and to truly understand the meaning of both the human and spiritual experience in an inclusive fashion.</p><p>I now want to share the story of this life-changing journey with my fellow human beings and cosmic souls, as a natural extension of the Journey itself, which has always been about sharing as authentically as possible and inspiring one another. Indeed, during this quest of mine, I was inspired by many wonderful people to continue to move forward and look beyond, as much as my incredible adventures surely inspired many in return, not necessarily to do what I have done or to take on my beliefs, but rather to perceive the world and the universe in a different, multi-angle way.</p><p>My book represents the result of my passion (and my genuine dedication to it) for sharing with outstanding human beings around the globe, through a lifetime of teaching (in many different disciplines), nearly 9 years without going back to France, and more than 2,000 hours of writing (just for this book alone). More specifically, this book tells the story of the first section of my moneyless quest around the world overland, when I went from France to Nepal (September 2012 - June 2014). Eventually, 8 years later, this journey has taken me all the way to the bottom tip of South America, and is still ongoing today somehow.</p><p>At the time, after I had worked in the education industry for more than 10 years (although I was “only” 33 years old), I spontaneously decided to leave my old routine behind (my job as a professional basketball coach and an English teacher, a four-year relationship and most of my material possessions) and indulge in a new adventure that would change my existence far beyond what I could ever predict or expect (geographically, culturally, socially, emotionally and spiritually). My idea was to travel around the entire globe, exclusively overland and overseas, without using any money at all (except when it came to the inevitable border crossings and visas).</p><p>I chose to name this project “Teacher on the Road”, not only because I personally had been teaching most of my “adult” life until I started hitting the road towards some unknown Eastern horizons, but also and especially because I believe that we are all teachers, guides and Masters to one another on the Path of Life. After all, the things we learn from and share with each other in this lifetime are endless (and limitless), especially while travelling, and we do not need an “official” label to do so (or to do anything, for that matter).</p><p> </p><p>There were many factors, of course, that led me to this rather unconventional and ambitious endeavour, and I want to take the time to tell you a very short version of the story because it is inevitably connected with the Playa Cosmica Project in Chacahua, Mexico, which I am now in the process of eventually manifesting. Overall, I wanted to radically change my life and prove to myself (and others in the process, as a “mirror”) that everything is possible as long as our intention is pure. So, I closed my bank account, set aside my last 400 Euros for the border crossings along the way, and set off with nothing more than very few essential possessions on my back, a direction in mind and an indescribable longing in my heart for something “else”.</p><p>Little did I know that, by going so far out of my comfort zone and down the rabbit hole, magic and synchronicity would quickly fill the elemental space that familiarity and predictability had once occupied in my life. It was merely the beginning of my very own quest for ultimate Freedom; a voyage during which I would go through a myriad of different cycles (which, as I explain in the book and refer to in its title, I have found to be inherent to Life, and more precisely, to its inherently inescapable process of Personal Liberation), exploring deeper layers of consciousness and all facets of human interconnectedness on the less-travelled paths of Spirit and Science. It might sound intricate or eccentric, but really, this is what we all (have come here to) do on this physical plane, whether we are aware of it or not, and regardless of the linear time (or lifetimes) it takes us to finally realize it.</p><p>This book is based on my travel diaries, which have been my most trusted companions through this adventure, and as such, it shares all the epic adventures and encounters (and many photos I took, as well as maps showing my route) that shaped the first two years of this journey, in which I went from France to Nepal, overland and without money. I also discuss varied, thought-provoking contemporary issues and controversial topics to illustrate the inner process that I went through at the time, exploring a considerable number of social, scientific, psychological, philosophical and metaphysical concepts, which have both engendered, and ensued from, the physical manifestation of this life-changing experience.</p><p> </p><p>It is important to acknowledge that my quest around the world overland turned out to be much longer than I ever anticipated, as I ever-increasingly embraced the Road towards new horizons (both literally and figuratively), and it took me all the way from Western Europe to Japan (from September 2012 to July 2015), and then from Alaska to the bottom tip of South America (from July 2015 to August 2020). Meanwhile, I spent years studying and experiencing a multitude of sustainable ways of living and co-existing concepts in many communities in order to make them coherent and effective to the wholeness of both our human and spiritual experiences.</p><p> </p><p>This is actually how I first arrived in Mexico (late November 2015) and Chacahua (mid December 2015). And I immediately fell in love with both, whether it comes to the beauty and rawness of the land as well as its connection with Mother Nature and the surrounding, omnipresent elements:</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Fire</strong>: There is so much sun for it is a semi-arid climate, and it is very accessible to make a bonfire at night as fire would be the only “missing” element at night (if we do not consider the light of the stars, of course).</li>
<li>
<strong>Air</strong>: the stars and the cosmos at hand.</li>
<li>
<strong>Earth</strong>: leaving barefoot in the sand at all times.</li>
<li>
<strong>Water</strong>: the presence of the powerful Pacific Ocean and the influence of the cycles of the moon.</li>
</ul><p>Although I had already living in many countries and outstanding places at the time, I instantly connected with the permanent surrounding magic of Chacahua and felt like Home here ever since (despite the fact that I had already long learnt that home can be everywhere and nowhere at the same time and that “Home” resides inside us at all times).</p><p>Yet, I was still on my way around the world overland when I first came to Chacahua and, even if I already thought of and investigated the possibilities of buying a piece of land and starting a sustainable-community project here in early 2017, I also felt that neither Chacahua nor myself were actually ready for that adventure yet.</p><p>As a result, in March 2018, I eventually set off for a new section of my long voyage all the way from Mexico to the very South of Chile and the bottom tip of South America.</p><p>I drove nearly 30,000 kilometres with two different vehicles over the course of the following two and a half years to get all the way to Punta Arenas (Southern Chile, Magellan Strait, Land of Fire) on March 18th 2020.</p><p>At that point, the development of the Covid-19 pandemic finally played its life-changing role and, even though I was meant to stay for only a couple of days in Punta Arenas before heading back North through Argentina and Brazil, Argentina closed its borders at that very moment and I eventually got completely stuck at the end of the world for five long months. Of course, that “unwanted” situation (and yet that I had somehow manifested to learn a lesson) induced a very intense personal process, but as everything to me -including the most intense challenges- is just another positive experience that is set to us in order to learn a necessary, meaningful lesson. Indeed, my unexpected stay in Punta Arenas allowed me to use my (lot of) spare time to finish my first book and start organizing my first music &amp; holistic workshop conscious festival in Chacahua, in December 2020 -we will surely get back to that in more details later.</p><p>Completely losing my freedom and connection with nature for so many months, in the harsh cold of the sub-Antarctic winter, also led me to making the decision to come back to my beloved Mexico and Chacahua (and “Home”) much earlier than what I had thought in the first place, in August 2020. As an allegory of Santiago of the Alchimist (Paolo Cuelho), my journey through central and South America was totally correlated with the idea of discovering and exploring prospective places to get started with my amazing project, but my heart could not be any more convinced that this place was actually Chacahua all along. And, this time, I finally feel totally ready to get started with the Playa Cósmica Project on a broader scale.</p><p>However, it has not been something easy to fully embrace and accept in the first place, for after having carefully observed, lived and felt the pace of the infrastructural and touristy evolution of Chacahua for the last 6 years, I suddenly and bitterly realized that the exploitation and commercialization of the place has been inexorably more obvious and intense in the last few months than in the last few years, all this in an exponential tempo.</p><p>Then, as I also realized that not only more and more projects had freshly mushroomed on the little island, but also many new lands were now on sale or sold in the National Park, which means that its inevitable decline and possible extinction has become a real issue to me and many others. For example, it just took a few years for towns like Mazunte, Zipolite or Tulum to develop to such an extent as we know them now (especially when it comes to Tulum) after they started getting more known and being abusively exploited on the real estate level (and on all possible levels actually).</p><p>Consequently, as I underwent my very own introspective process about the matter, I asked myself whether I actually wanted to be part of this massacre or not, in case I would myself implement my project within the boundaries of the National Park. Yet, I have long learnt how the world works, so I also know that other exclusively money-oriented, ill-intentioned people will probably build fancy resorts within the boundaries of the National Park at some point, which would be much worse for the local wildlife and vegetation. Therefore, I now believe that manifesting the Playa Cosmica Project in Chacahua is actually the “right” thing to do (at least to me) in order to protect the land. Through my own process, I used to be reluctant to this huge responsibility and I have had to accept that this is what I have to and want to do.</p><p> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>The Playa Cósmica Project:</strong></u></h2><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p>Originally, the project was named after the “Playa Cosmica Solstice Festival”. It is a free, conscious event I organized in Chacahua for the first time from December 21st to 23rd 2020, and which was a massive accomplishment in itself considering the tremendous impact that Covid-19 has had on this type of events since the pandemic broke out.</p><p>The festival consists of a mix of holistic workshops during the day and live music at night until sunrise. Since I intend to make this gathering happen at least once a year during the December solstice, it seems very coherent and meaningful to also name the project this way since the festival will be fully part of it far beyond the waves of sound and healing it generates in the meantime. Chacahua is a very magical, cosmic beach and indeed, the idea is to teach trainees a myriad of concrete healing and personal-development tools and techniques through varied courses and retreats, so that the attendees can then practise their new skills and share them during the festival for free.</p><p>Furthermore, the intention of the Playa Cósmica Project is not only to contribute to the protection of the National Park by buying some land so that people cannot destroy the pristine nature (as it is already taking place) and build fancy resorts on them (as already debated before), but also to eventually relocate the turtle protection centre. In fact, the recent relatively industrial constructions next to the “tortuguero” (turtle center) as well as the overall evolution of Chacahua in the last few months have made me realized that, sadly, this area of the island may be actually swallowed by abusive structural and architectural exploitation in a not-so-distant future, so relocating the turtle protection centre to a further location (as well as the actual location of the Playa Cosmica Project) could be a very effective way to ensure its survival and maintenance in the years to come regardless of how Chacahua evolves in the meantime.</p><p>Therefore, the Playa Cosmica Solstice Festival (as part of bigger picture of the Playa Cósmica Project) is an efficient, powerful tool to promote the protection of the National Park and local wildlife and I definitely need a little financial support to make all the rest of the magic happen.</p><p> </p><p>Furthermore, throughout the year, according to moon cycles and astrological events, courses and retreats will be available on site. The idea is to make them as affordable and inclusive as possible so that they will be accessible to everyone (free for locals).</p><p>Since many people are eager to learn sustainable living and a holistic approach of medicine (and healing) but they do not know how/what to do, the concept of the Playa Cósmica Project is to teach them how to develop a multitude of interconnected skills that can assist them in reconnecting with their essence, unconditional love and happiness and then share these essential human feelings with others in order to shift the energy frequency of the whole collective consciousness, hence the entire current societal paradigm. The content of the classes/workshops will assist people in learning about how to handle and balance their energies and emotions (as part of the inherent body-mind-spirit balance) so that they can finally integrate that we cannot heal others if we are not ready to be honest with ourselves and heal ourselves in the first place. That we cannot love others if we are not able to love ourselves in the first place and so on and forth. Only then can we understand the meaningfulness of the human experience as a soul and that, despite having a very unique Ride and different paths/missions/functions on this physical plane, we all have the very same potential and choice to manifest abundance in our existence. I have never said it is something easy to do, but it is definitely worth a try.</p><p> </p><p>At last, I would like to put a little more emphasis on the communitarian aspect of the Playa Cósmica Project, especially when it comes to the subtle balance of the social interactions and energy exchange through it. The essence of the human experience is all about meeting people and exchanging energies with after all.</p><p>Throughout my many travels and sustainable-community experiences all over the world, I have noticed that there is often an imbalance between what I consider as the three pillars of how we interact with others and with our direct environment; the intimate interconnection between how we relate to:</p><ul>
<li>The self</li>
<li>Our fellow community members</li>
<li>Nature</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>As I use the word “community”, I refer to any types of communities somehow, whether they are sustainable or not, and regardless of the number of its members -the minimum being 2 people, which can makes us wonder and debate about the notion of friendship or “couple” (what I like to call “intimate relationship”, although again, any type of relationship contains love -which can manifest itself in a multitude of fashions, and any type of relationship can possess its very own form of intimacy).</p><p>Through the rat race of the city life (which I personally also experienced and chose to leave behind at some stage), we tend to be surrounded by a lot of distractions and social pressure which, in turns, tends to disconnect us from nature, hence from our very essence. Maintaining the balance between these three pillars is what supports us in becoming unconditionally happy and satisfied with our existence as well as in love with ourselves therefore with others:</p><ul>
<li>Taking some personal time for ourselves is what makes us process and integrate all our life experiences, lessons and emotions</li>
<li>Taking some collective time to exchange ideas with like-minded people makes us grow, heal and feel human</li>
<li>Taking some time to connect with Mother Nature and the cosmos (whether individually or collectively) changes our perception of the world and teaches us our real place on Earth and in the universe, so that it may facilitate the process of understanding why our soul has decided to come back to this physical plane in this very physical body for this very experience in the here and now.</li>
</ul><p> </p><h3><strong><u>The Playa Cósmica Project has three principal research and practice directions:</u></strong></h3><p> </p><ul><li>
<strong><u>Holistic therapy and Psylotherapy</u></strong> (as part of the Mushroom Research Center):</li></ul><p>I have been studying and practising diverse techniques of physiotherapy (in my quest of re-attuning with the ultimate balance between the East and the West) for the last 20 years. Meanwhile, I have slowly but surely connected with some sacred/psychedelic substances that came to me at some point, although they all came along relatively “late” (at least in terms of physical age), so that I never really felt the need or flow to experience their recreational side like many people do. Yet, it makes sense as I have always felt and believed that these plants and mushrooms have so much more to offer to the world than being used just for “fun”.</p><p>Very long story cut short, throughout years of practice, I started understanding how to finally combine all the healing tools I had learnt and experienced along the way to develop my very own holistic therapies, which I actually started sharing in Chacahua, in 2016, along with the reconnection with two of the most powerful, accurate and special tools I can share with others, namely astronomy and astrology, whether it has taken place through courses or some other birth chart readings.</p><p>As I came back to Chacahua from the Chilean Patagonia, in August 2020, I eventually started a new cycle as a holistic therapist. Again, my practice is a combination of many tools (in order to maximize and individualize the process for each and every one of us, including myself), and although I can always give a specific physiotherapy treatment or relaxing massage to someone, the concept of the treatments I usually give to my patients consists of three therapies in one in order to make it as holistic and effective as possible:</p><ul><li>
<strong>Foot reflexology</strong> (as part of the Chinese Medicine skills I share and through a fusion of Reiki and reflexology) to work on the organs level, which tend to accumulate lots of subconscious emotions (the best examples of this are the stomach and digestive system when it comes to anxiety). Also, foot reflexology is already a full therapy in itself, during which tremendous exchanges of energy can be felt by both the patient and practitioner, and it opens the energy meridians and prepares the patient's body to receive the following part of the treatment.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>
<strong>Back therapy and realignment</strong>, which has very little to do with a conventional massage for the simple reason that the intention is not only physical (or physiological), but also and especially energetical and emotional. Indeed, healing the three bodies (physical, energetical and emotional) is what allows the therapy to become holistic and to heal people in the deepest and most subconscious (at times even unconscious, generational or karmic) psychosomatic way, as I believe everything is psychosomatic and we do manifest everything that takes place in our lives, including physical injuries and wounds...and physical death. This part of the treatment consists of realigning the spine without any proper osteopathic manipulation, and instead of doing so through Chinese acupuncture points and specific techniques of deep tissue massage on the Bladder Meridian all the way from the hip bone (sacred Yin) to the crown (Cosmic Yang), as well as by working on both the feminine (Yin-left) and masculine (Yang-right) parts of the body to unlock emotional tensions and blockages. Indeed, learning how to “read” someone's back like I did through my own experience gives us a substantial amount of indications about old traumas and blockages that still linger in the physical body (often coming from childhood and/or adolescence), and bringing them back to the surface is what allows me to facilitate their process and integration for the patient.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>
<strong>Reiki</strong>, biomagnetism and the channelling of electro-magnetic energies in the end of the therapy, at the very moment when the physical, energetical and emotional bodies are completely relaxed, attunes and at peace, so that the exchange of energies is more profound and efficient than ever.</li></ul><p> </p><p>By the beginning of 2021, I finally felt ready to start giving therapies on psilocybin mushroom micro-dosing, which I had already experienced in some other forms before. After a very promising first experience during which I was on about 0.8 grams of psilocybin mushroom (as a quick reminder, despite the inherent relativity of the concept, a full mushroom journey is usually 3 to 5 grams of dried mushrooms and micro-dosing them usually consists of taking 0.1 to 0.2 grams one day on – one day off (or two days on – one day off) for a period of time that ranges from two to three weeks.</p><p>During that experience, I could induce sacred-geometry visions in my patient's head, which is what he told me during my traditional feedback time just after the session (according to the notes I take in the meantime, so that I do not disturb the process). Consequently, I started getting very interested in using psilocybin mushroom micro-dosing with some specific patients with a deep emotional or karmic charge, or even those who came to me with rare diseases. For example, I have this 30-ish year-old female English patient who was diagnosed with Crohn disease at 7 years old. Since again, I believe that everything we manifest in our physical body is psychosomatic (which we can prove through Quantum Physics), I do not think that the emotional charge we carry at such young age belongs exclusively in this incarnation and somehow has to come from generational or even karmic patterns. As a result, the psilocybin mushroom micro-dosing with this patient has allowed me to bring some profound emotions back to the “surface” and heal her on a much deeper level than what it would have been with a more conventional therapy, like it has been the case with many other patients ever since.</p><p>Ultimately, one of the goals of the Playa Cósmica Project is to study the human brain and define some scientific patterns with a carefully-selected (or consciously-manifested) team of competent, open-minded, passionate people in order to develop telepathy (cognitive knowledge-Yang) and empathy (emotions-Yin) with the patients/trainees/attendees. This may seem a little “crazy” and far-fetched, but it is not really so when we eventually understand that we all are a little crazy in our very own way and that the real issue would be not to be aware of that. Also, these concepts are not so far-fetched when we understand the foundations of Quantum Physics and that it is scientifically proven that we can completely change the wiring of our neurons (and, in fact, as we can “rewire” them) and therefore the way we deal both cognitively and emotionally with life.</p><p>Moreover, my theory is that many people want to “change the world” but we keep on using human words that are heavily charged with millennia of cognitive and emotional nonsense, so we could totally change the way we communicate with our fellow beings through telepathy (which I believe is completely real whenever we connect with others on a more profound level, and I am pretty sure that everyone that will read these lines all the way to that point has already had that amazing feeling), and feeling and listening to our intuition instead of over-thinking “problems” that only exist in our mind. Consequently, this would limit the use of human words and the “negative” routine/energy that is inherently ingrained in them. Only then can we change ourselves and hence the world by setting our most honest, authentic intention into the human collective (and therefore elevate its energy frequency).</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">***</p><p><strong>This is an extract of my book: “Teacher on the Road – The Five Phases of Death” (2020)</strong></p><p> </p><p><i>“As I started becoming more and more interested in what the true power of our misunderstood brain could be, I realised that its volume has not evolved for the last 230,000 years, and since the appearance of Homo Neanderthalensis (over a 2 million-year timespan, the volume of the brain went from 600 cm3 with Homo Habilis, to 1680 cm3 with Homo Neanderthalensis, which is its actual current size). I also figured out that, “coincidentally”, psilocybin (psychoactive) mushrooms began being used in sacred rituals all over the world approximately 230,000 years ago (cave-paintings and other visionary art date back to about 40,000 years ago, but this is not incompatible with the idea that whoever made them built on an already existing legacy of even more ancient and probably less outwardly-“expressive” rituals).</i></p><p> </p><p><i>Fungi are also intriguing because the connections between their cells are very similar to the axonal and synaptic connections between the neurons of the human brain. In 1998, a bunch of scientists discovered that fungi split from animals about 1.538 billion years ago, whereas plants split from animals about 1.547 billion years ago. This means fungi split from animals about 9 million years after plants did, which entails that fungi are actually more closely related to animals (and therefore to humans) than plants are. Also, it has been scientifically proven that the mycelium (the underground “root” system of mushrooms) connects all trees and plants together, through a gigantic network of trillions of smart cells, that can be compared to the workings of the human brain.</i></p><p><i>We also know that every single fungus has a specific function: some, like Turkey Tail, are 8 times more efficient than chemotherapy for curing cancer, and others, like psilocybin mushrooms and Lion's Mane, facilitate the neuron-genesis process (in other words, the rebirth and growth of neurons in the brain, which could help cure diseases or psychological conditions such as Alzheimer, schizophrenia, psychosis, addictions or depression) - and this all in a natural, chemical-free way-. So it is not actually so far-fetched to think that their consumption could have had a huge impact on the evolution of humanity.</i></p><p><i>As Terrence McKenna and Graham Hancock also suggested in their respective researches, I believe not only that psychedelic mushrooms are very likely to have induced the very first form of religion and spirituality in our evolution, hundreds of thousands of years ago, but it is also very plausible that the human brain tripled in size (from Homo Habilis to Homo Neanderthalensis) because of these hundreds of thousands of years of regular consumption of psilocybin mushrooms. It is even possible that the human brain has stopped growing ever since, because mushroom consumption has been quite misunderstood and repressed throughout our more recent history. And yet, even though this is a very acceptable theory regarding human evolution (especially in a Darwinian perspective), it remains merely a theory -the “Stoned Ape Theory”, as Terrence McKenna named it-, like there are many others out there, and it is up to each and every one of us to do our own critical, independent research about this topic.</i></p><p> </p><p><i>For my part, not only do I find this theory very plausible, but I also believe that ancient civilisations had become very advanced with regards to both Science and Spirit, all over the world, because of their regular intake of psychoactive substances, and that the crisis of consciousness we are experiencing today is somehow connected with the permanent repression that sacred, ancestral plants have been subjected to in the last decades. Indeed, all medicinal, healing substances such as mushrooms (psilocybin), Peyote (mescaline), San Pedro (mescaline), Ayahuasca (DMT), marijuana (THC-CBD), or even LSD (which is a semi-synthetic substance, that nonetheless originated in nature -actually from another mushroom, the rye ergot fungus- and has been scientifically proven to have many healing effects, if taken with respect and awareness), have been incessantly labelled as “dangerous, useless hard drugs” (such as cocaine or heroin), and, consequently, the true potential they may have to explore and understand the meaning and purpose of our existence on this physical plane has been utterly dismissed.</i></p><p> </p><p><i>Of course, this is all theory, and I felt like I needed to experiment with it for myself. I ingested some mushrooms for the first time in Amsterdam, in 2003, and it did not end up being an outstanding experience. However, I tried them again after I came back from Australia, in 2008, with my friend Carole, and later in Amsterdam (again) as I lived there, and these times, it was the most insightful, meaningful experience ever, during which I was so lucid and clear-minded that I truly felt like my comprehension of consciousness was able to reach a whole new depth. I could process so much information all at once that I could finally grasp the intrinsic beauty of our connection with nature and the entire cosmos timelessly.</i></p><p><i>This knowledge and wisdom are always there, but they are usually not accessible to us because we are so distracted and mind-oriented all the time. These sacred substances may actually contain many existential answers that we all seek sooner or later, and may allow us to accept their consequences too, especially when it comes to interconnectedness, destiny, synchronicity, or even to unconditional love, faith, and the immortality of the soul. After all, even when it comes to Prince Siddharta; who can say if he did not, in fact, find and ingest a few psilocybin mushrooms around while he was meditating under his famous Bodhi tree for 40 consecutive days, which facilitated and enhanced his “enlightenment” process (after which he would become known as the Buddha)?”</i></p><p> </p><p>I have always been fascinated by all types of mushrooms since I was a young child even if it is only much later, in 2015, that I profoundly reconnected with them. Since then, I have studied, picked and experienced them quite substantially, like many other fields.</p><p>After I stayed in a mushroom community and research centre in Guatemala, in 2017, it could not be any clearer that one of my purposes would be to implement my very own mushroom research centre somewhere, someday. And I believe that Chacahua is the perfect place for that since it is such a powerful, ceremonial energy vortex. The idea is to use psilocybin and other non-psychedelic medicinal mushrooms in a micro-dosing as well as full-journey perspective in order to study their effects onto the human body and brain, as well as onto energies and emotions, and hence to reconnect with the ultimate balance between the body, mind and Spirit.</p><p> </p><ul><li><u><strong>The Astronomy Observation Center:</strong></u></li></ul><p>This is another extract of my book: “Teacher on the Road – The Five Phases of Death” (2020)</p><p> </p><p><i>“I do not believe in a specific God, but I actually do believe in the Universe as a whole, as everything and everyone comes from the same substance. We are Its atomic and chemical extensions, and are made out of recycled star matter, and so is everything around us. Subsequently, we are inexorably connected with Its energetic pulse in this physical “dimensity” (a “portmanteau word” that I like using in order to communicate the meaningful marriage between “dimension” and “immensity”).</i></p><p><i>Therefore, listening to our heart and intuitions in order to make choices allows us to get closer to some form of spirituality, or at least to whatever suits each and every one of us on our respective paths, both on an individual and collective level. As to all the things that are not up to us to control; I believe that our purpose in life is to embrace the Unknown of our own Path, so our heartbeats can tune and lean into the rhythm and flow of Its eternal, ethereal cosmic energies.</i></p><p> </p><p><i>At age 11, as I entered middle-school, I had the opportunity to start studying Astronomy. Our ancestors -knowledgeable, wise and advanced in the subject as they were- often considered it to be the Mother of all Sciences. It was such a beautiful synchronicity to end up in the only middle-school in France (named “Paul Valery”, in Nice) that actually possessed a planetarium in its yard, with an Astronomy club and classes available on site for those pupils who chose to include the subject in their curriculum, along with the more common ones such as Mathematics, Literature, Physical Education or languages.</i></p><p><i>As a consequence, by age 13, some of my geeky buddies and I were already able to give lectures and planetarium sessions for adults, with the accompanying stories from Greek mythology about the starry Southern night sky. During my eighth grade, when pupils had to pick a place (association, shop, company or institution) to do a compulsory apprenticeship as part of the grade's syllabus, I proudly became the first pupil ever to do my two-week training at the renowned Observatory of Nice (the oldest in Europe, built by Eiffel in the 1880s).</i></p><p> </p><p><i>After I had brilliantly completed my training there, it seemed only logical to become an astrophysicist and make a career for myself in this field. On the one hand, my ego seemed to be very satisfied with this idea, but on the other, my heart was telling me that I also had some other important passions to embrace in this life, instead of rigorously completing an Astronomy PhD for ten years, just to then lock myself in a lab or be stuck in front of a computer all day long for the following decades. I realised that becoming an astrophysicist would actually take me light years away from what I loved in Astronomy itself; since the latter is just a tiny fraction of what we can See of the complex cosmos that lies both outside and inside of everyone.</i></p><p><i>Instead of becoming a professional in this nonetheless fascinating subject, I just wanted to remain a passionate star gazer and wanderer of consciousness, so I swiftly gave up on the idea, which most probably was the first massive disappointing blow I induced to my parents' expectations. Meanwhile, it has not prevented me from feeling at Home and at peace, whenever I am gazing at my celestial Sisters. I have never really been able to explain why exactly I started studying Astronomy or Astrology so young (I bought my first Astrology book at age 14), aside from the beautiful synchronicity that has made my knowledge the intriguing melting-pot it is now.</i></p><p> </p><p><i>Exploring these fascinating, ancestral subjects has been a great eye- (and heart-) opener to the world that surrounds me, and I later understood that all details of our existence are intimately connected with one another, even the tiniest things we do every day, or the persons we meet for the briefest moments - which is what the magic of travelling is all about. After all, this is how I have come all the way to the point of writing these lines right now. And yet, publishing a book for others has never been a purpose in itself; I would already be delighted to have the possibility to read what I have written in 10 or 20 years from now, in order to see how I have evolved and grown in the meantime, or else how efficient I have been at learning the lessons I have come here to learn.</i></p><p> </p><p><i>Furthermore, I have always been utterly captivated by the idea that, although ancient civilisations did not supposedly communicate with one another (at least according to mainstream history, for they were supposedly scattered all over the world, in different points of space and time), they all still discovered the same very advanced astronomical knowledge. In the last hundred years, with “modern” science, our civilisation has just merely confirmed what they had already explored and assimilated millennia ago.</i></p><p><i>How were they able to achieve such a mastery of advanced knowledge and wisdom, when they were supposed to be modest hunters and berry pickers?</i></p><p><i>I will avoid getting too much into the details of how relevant (or irrelevant) the commonly-accepted version of history as we know it truly is, for now. But to shortly answer my own question, I reckon that the knowledge of Astronomy, in particular, that these (supposedly) “primitive” people had, stemmed from their deep connection to Mother Earth and the Universe as a whole, which was not yet tainted by the multitude of environmental distractions that afflict us all so much nowadays.</i></p><p> </p><p><i>As I worked as a general educator at Ségurane Middle-School, in Nice, in 2008 and 2009, I set up an Astronomy club with the assistance and support of a dear friend of mine, Carole, whose spiritual evolution seemed to parallel my own. We were both educators when we met, in 2008, and she soon became a Mathematics teacher, while I became an English teacher.</i></p><p><i>Yet, we had (and still have) Astronomy and Astrophysics as common passions, and it was essential for us to share these as well as pass on the message of the stars to our pupils. This experience then became an amazing achievement, which allowed both of us to delve even deeper into the understanding of our intimate connection with the Universe through the concepts of infinite space and time. Indeed, the reach of “infinite” is usually too unfathomable and intangible for our brains to perceive, since in our society, it was never trained to integrate such mind-bugging scales. This is why I started digging down the rabbit hole in the first place, both outside and inside, so that I may find some answers I had long been looking for.”</i></p><p> </p><p>I have long realized that astronomy and astrology are two of the most amazing skills I can share with others, and this one of the reasons why I want to teach these growing tools with my fellow human beings. Another reason is that they are two very powerful, meaningful fields that can change one's perception of the world ad the universe. Since we are the Universe both inside and outside, this process has to go in a mutual, balanced way both outwardly and inwardly, which means that understanding astronomy and astrology assist us in understanding ourselves, hence others.</p><p> </p><ul><li><u><strong>The Diving Research Centre:</strong></u></li></ul><p>As a Dive Master and a passionate individual about the seas and oceans of the world, and throughout my considerable free-diving and scuba-diving experience since 2003, I have always believed that the concept of diving goes way beyond the number of metres we explore beneath the surface of the water. Paradoxically enough, I have never been willing to work in the scuba-diving industry because I have always believed that there is so much more to diving and taking a bunch of tourists down into the Big Blue and ruining its bottom for the sake of money.</p><p>First of all, since we humans are made of about 70% of water, diving reconnects us simply with what we are. Also, in astrology, the water element (and water signs; Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces) connects us with our deepest emotions, esoterism and all our spiritual and metaphysical ideals, therefore with our sensibility, vulnerability and feminine divine that we all possess in equal amount in the first place on the energy level.</p><p>Also, diving initiates and familiarizes us with the discovery of a new material world, which assists us in facing our fears when it comes to accepting the “unknown” and things we cannot control and want to let go of in our lives. Also, the different perception of gravity and being completely surrounded with water takes us back to where everything started (at least without going back all the way to the stardust stage), which is our mother's womb. As a result, diving is a wonderful way to indulge a nurturing and peaceful feeling to deal with our most profound traumas and emotions in order to process them, integrate them, therefore to heal them.</p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>Playa Cósmica Retreats</strong></u></h3><p> </p><p><u><strong>Goal:</strong></u> To give a broad spectrum of concrete, complementary, useful “tools” and skills to the trainees in order to thrive in both their human and spiritual experience, at an affordable price.</p><p> </p><ul><li><strong>Why?</strong></li></ul><p>Most courses and retreats are usually very specific, and offer services that are very intense throughout a very short period of time. This retreat explores many topics and teaches the trainees how to interconnect them in order to understand the bigger picture of the big Cosmic Puzzle we live in, and to give them more time for setting their intention and integration and for coherent, practical application into their daily life.</p><p>Not only is this retreat a profound introspection of the world inside and outside to assimilate it better, but it is also a wonderful insight to maintain and balance the attendees' energetical space ever after. Consequently, they can (re)connect with their original essence, potential and equilibrium between the body, the mind and the spirit. This process is conveyed through the permanent motion and emotional process of the moon cycles, and through their intimate energetical connection with the elemental equilibrium inside and outside of us.</p><p> </p><ul><li><strong>How long?</strong></li></ul><p>Technically, retreats as I perceive them can be very short (at least for a couple of days, like I did a few times when I was living in Ecuador and Peru) or much longer depending on what is their emotional and energetical intention and purpose.</p><p>Nevertheless, I am going to remain focused on the 30-day retreat I would like to manifest through the Playa Cósmica Project.</p><p>Thirty days are an entire moon cycle (the moon orbit around the Earth is 27.25 days – sideral period - but the full phasing cycle is about 29.5 days – sinodic period-, since the sun is also moving in the sky according to the Earth's orbit around it). Or from one new moon to the following one.</p><p>In astrology, we are influenced by many cosmic aspects at the same time, and they start long before we were born in this life and they keep going long after we depart from it. Yet, the celestial body that rules our life on a daily basis is the moon, because it represents the fluctuation of our emotional body, the core of our unique personality. The moon remains for approximately 2.3 days in each and every of the 12 signs of the Zodiac and their element (fire, earth, air or water) during each and every of its cycles around the Earth. Therefore, the practice and activities during the retreat follow the signs of the zodiac, hence their respective elements and their specific attributes.</p><p>It is important to note that the moon not only influences the way we feel and behave, but it also incarnates the feminine divine within us. Although it particularly impacts women on the physiological level (through the menstruation cycle), it is also fundamental to understand that this process is not just all about the physical gender. Yes, men experience emotional menstruation as well, because the moon impacts the 70-ish% of water that compose our physical body as much as it does with the tidal cycles of the oceans.</p><p>Since water is the element that most incarnate our emotions and feelings, the influence of the Queen of the Night has overall very little to do regarding whether we are a woman or a man (again, aside from the massive physiological aspect of it, of course, for it is absolutely no coincidence that the moon revolution around the Earth and a regular menstruation cycle both last for 28 days).</p><p>Overall, we all do have a feminine and a masculine side as part of our primordial Yin (feminine)-Yang (masculine) balance, and understanding how it works (and how intensely we're connected with astrological events at all times) is a fantastic tool to understand the subtleties of how we connect with this physical plane throughout our human experience.</p><p> </p><ul><li><strong>What?</strong></li></ul><p>The different 'tools' that are included in the course are divided into 4 modules according to their nature, as each of them is inherently related to one of the 4 elements of Greek astrology (like for any other activity or emotion in our daily reality, as well as our very own essence or 'personality'). As such, each day of the course will revolve around one or multiple activities from the module related to the elemental moon transit of that specific day.</p><p> </p><p>Note: It doesn't mean that if the moon element of the day is earth, the courses will involve more earth (or more grounding). Indeed, since the intent of the retreat is all about reconnecting with a form of personal and collective (or inner and outer) balance, an 'earth' day is actually perfect to work with one of the other 3 elements.</p><p>Then, it is all about the experiment of the process, for the outcome may be very different for each and every of the participants, including for the teachers.</p><p> </p><p><strong><i>[Trainee's predominant chart's element (out of 11 aspects) -A- + his/her chart's moon element -B-] + [specific day's predominant element (out of 10 aspects) -C- + its moon element -D-] = Elemental tool of the day</i></strong></p><p><strong><i>For instance: [Fire -A- + Earth -B- ] + [Fire -C- + Air -D- ] = [(+) (Yang) + (-) (Yin)] + [(+) (Yang) + (+) (Yang)] = 0 Yin + (2+) Yang = (2+)Yang = elemental tools/activities of the day in Earth or Water (in Yin) in order to counter-balance and channel efficiently this person's energy and astrological influence of a specific day (or period of time/cycle)</i></strong></p><p> </p><p>Of course, since each trainee's chart is personal, the sun, moon and planetary transits will all differ from one another, and the course curriculum can only be based on the predominant element of the day (or of the course) and its moon element (2nd half of the equation).</p><p>Nonetheless, we still believe this will provide the participants with useful insight into the ruling of the sun, moon, planets and of the elements upon their personal and collective energies. It will also teach the trainees how to make the most of the overall astrological influence on a daily basis, especially as it is paired with sufficient, concrete knowledge and practice regarding many other compatible, complementary skills, taught by experienced and qualified teachers.</p><p> </p><ul><li><u><strong>How?</strong></u></li></ul><p>200-hour retreat (theory + practical activities)</p><p>5 days/week theory + practice (about 8 hours)</p><p>1 day/week exclusively practice (about 8 hours) + feedback + sharing circle + staff meeting</p><p>1 day/week completely off (+ silent day + optional fasting) + fun activities (photo-plancton + surf, …)</p><p> </p><ul><li><strong><u>Content specifics (this is an example and may be subjected to some adjustments at some stage):</u></strong></li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>1) Module 1 (WATER): 50 hours</strong></p><p>36 hours morning yoga (6 classes/week X 1.5 hours) (9 hours for each element's specific flow -fire, earth, air, water-) for all levels</p><p>6 hours yoga anatomy/physiology</p><p>2 hours yoga intention (goals of Asanas on energy level &amp; channeling)</p><p>4 hours emotional development</p><p>2 hours conscious nutrition</p><p> </p><p><strong>2) Module 2 (AIR): 50 hours</strong></p><p>36 hours Greek astrology theory + practice (how to read/interpret an astral chart + planetary transits)</p><p>4 hours Mayan &amp; Chinese astrology theory + practice</p><p>10 hours astronomy + Greek mythology stories + find your way across the sky</p><p> </p><p><strong>3) Module 3 (EARTH): 50 hours</strong></p><p>40 hours holistic medicine/Chinese medicine, therapeutic massage &amp; acupressure theory + practice (+ energy meridians)</p><p>4 hours aromatherapy (theory + practice)</p><p>2 hours medicinal mushrooms &amp; psychedelic mushrooms + micro-dosing + ceremony</p><p>2 hours tincture making (theory + practice)</p><p>2 hours cacao ceremony theory (+ ceremony/ecstatic dance practice for full moon)</p><p> </p><p><strong>4) Module 4 (FIRE): 50 hours</strong></p><p>20 hours reiki level I &amp; II (breathing + chakras + meditation + pendulum) &amp; practice</p><p>20 hours holistic physiotherapy (+protection/cleansing/crystals/music/mushrooms therapy)</p><p>4 hours tantra (+ “shadow work” + emotional honesty practice)</p><p>2 hours meditation/breathing work theory (practice part of yoga classes)</p><p>2 hours sound therapy (practice part of yoga/holistic therapy)</p><p>2 hours quantum physics + law of manifestation debate</p><p> </p><p>Extras: - 1 cacao ceremony/Ecstatic dance every week (upon moon phases/other astrological events)</p><p>Certificates in Chinese medicine, astrology, reiki, yoga, aromatherapy</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">***</p><p>Overall, the goal of this campaign is to collect 150,000 US dollars, which is the total amount of money I have calculated and budgeted for the price of land, construction and development of the Playa Cósmica Holistic Centre.</p><p>Let me tell you a bit more about how it works and how you can contribute to the Playa Cósmica Project.

Yet, I feel like a true citizen of the world after having travelled, lived and worked in 49 different countries for the last 20 years (and for the last 9 years in a row).I graduated with a Master's Degree in Physical Education (encompassing professional coaching, group management, sport psychology, and nutrition and health) at the Sports and Sciences University of Nice, France (2000-2004). In addition to my career in Physical Education, I substantially taught English as a second language until 2016 in Mexico (at least in a formal, “official” structure), for I had become a certified teacher of the University of Cambridge's international CELTA program in Amsterdam, in 2011. Furthermore, I have extensively studied and taught in the fields of sustainable development, astrology and astronomy, yoga, Reiki, Chinese medicine, holistic massage and physiotherapy throughout the years. Not only have I worked as a high-school teacher or University Professor in many of these fields in France, The Netherlands, India, Nepal, Japan, Mexico, Ecuador and Peru, but I also have a substantial amount of more “random” professional experience, such as a photographer, a restaurant and bar manager, and even as a professional fisherman and farm manager. In fact, as I explain substantially in my first book (“Teacher on the Road - The Five Phases of Death”, published in 2020), while most people choose (or are forced to choose) a “career”, supposedly for most of their life, I have always been inexorably drawn towards a multi-disciplinary approach of existence, in an attempt to put all the pieces of the giant cosmic puzzle together so to speak, and to truly understand the meaning of both the human and spiritual experience in an inclusive fashion.I now want to share the story of this life-changing journey with my fellow human beings and cosmic souls, as a natural extension of the Journey itself, which has always been about sharing as authentically as possible and inspiring one another. Indeed, during this quest of mine, I was inspired by many wonderful people to continue to move forward and look beyond, as much as my incredible adventures surely inspired many in return, not necessarily to do what I have done or to take on my beliefs, but rather to perceive the world and the universe in a different, multi-angle way.My book represents the result of my passion (and my genuine dedication to it) for sharing with outstanding human beings around the globe, through a lifetime of teaching (in many different disciplines), nearly 9 years without going back to France, and more than 2,000 hours of writing (just for this book alone). More specifically, this book tells the story of the first section of my moneyless quest around the world overland, when I went from France to Nepal (September 2012 - June 2014). Eventually, 8 years later, this journey has taken me all the way to the bottom tip of South America, and is still ongoing today somehow.At the time, after I had worked in the education industry for more than 10 years (although I was “only” 33 years old), I spontaneously decided to leave my old routine behind (my job as a professional basketball coach and an English teacher, a four-year relationship and most of my material possessions) and indulge in a new adventure that would change my existence far beyond what I could ever predict or expect (geographically, culturally, socially, emotionally and spiritually). My idea was to travel around the entire globe, exclusively overland and overseas, without using any money at all (except when it came to the inevitable border crossings and visas).I chose to name this project “Teacher on the Road”, not only because I personally had been teaching most of my “adult” life until I started hitting the road towards some unknown Eastern horizons, but also and especially because I believe that we are all teachers, guides and Masters to one another on the Path of Life. After all, the things we learn from and share with each other in this lifetime are endless (and limitless), especially while travelling, and we do not need an “official” label to do so (or to do anything, for that matter). There were many factors, of course, that led me to this rather unconventional and ambitious endeavour, and I want to take the time to tell you a very short version of the story because it is inevitably connected with the Playa Cosmica Project in Chacahua, Mexico, which I am now in the process of eventually manifesting. Overall, I wanted to radically change my life and prove to myself (and others in the process, as a “mirror”) that everything is possible as long as our intention is pure. So, I closed my bank account, set aside my last 400 Euros for the border crossings along the way, and set off with nothing more than very few essential possessions on my back, a direction in mind and an indescribable longing in my heart for something “else”.Little did I know that, by going so far out of my comfort zone and down the rabbit hole, magic and synchronicity would quickly fill the elemental space that familiarity and predictability had once occupied in my life. It was merely the beginning of my very own quest for ultimate Freedom; a voyage during which I would go through a myriad of different cycles (which, as I explain in the book and refer to in its title, I have found to be inherent to Life, and more precisely, to its inherently inescapable process of Personal Liberation), exploring deeper layers of consciousness and all facets of human interconnectedness on the less-travelled paths of Spirit and Science. It might sound intricate or eccentric, but really, this is what we all (have come here to) do on this physical plane, whether we are aware of it or not, and regardless of the linear time (or lifetimes) it takes us to finally realize it.This book is based on my travel diaries, which have been my most trusted companions through this adventure, and as such, it shares all the epic adventures and encounters (and many photos I took, as well as maps showing my route) that shaped the first two years of this journey, in which I went from France to Nepal, overland and without money. I also discuss varied, thought-provoking contemporary issues and controversial topics to illustrate the inner process that I went through at the time, exploring a considerable number of social, scientific, psychological, philosophical and metaphysical concepts, which have both engendered, and ensued from, the physical manifestation of this life-changing experience. It is important to acknowledge that my quest around the world overland turned out to be much longer than I ever anticipated, as I ever-increasingly embraced the Road towards new horizons (both literally and figuratively), and it took me all the way from Western Europe to Japan (from September 2012 to July 2015), and then from Alaska to the bottom tip of South America (from July 2015 to August 2020). Meanwhile, I spent years studying and experiencing a multitude of sustainable ways of living and co-existing concepts in many communities in order to make them coherent and effective to the wholeness of both our human and spiritual experiences. This is actually how I first arrived in Mexico (late November 2015) and Chacahua (mid December 2015). And I immediately fell in love with both, whether it comes to the beauty and rawness of the land as well as its connection with Mother Nature and the surrounding, omnipresent elements:

Fire: There is so much sun for it is a semi-arid climate, and it is very accessible to make a bonfire at night as fire would be the only “missing” element at night (if we do not consider the light of the stars, of course).

Air: the stars and the cosmos at hand.

Earth: leaving barefoot in the sand at all times.

Water: the presence of the powerful Pacific Ocean and the influence of the cycles of the moon.
Although I had already living in many countries and outstanding places at the time, I instantly connected with the permanent surrounding magic of Chacahua and felt like Home here ever since (despite the fact that I had already long learnt that home can be everywhere and nowhere at the same time and that “Home” resides inside us at all times).Yet, I was still on my way around the world overland when I first came to Chacahua and, even if I already thought of and investigated the possibilities of buying a piece of land and starting a sustainable-community project here in early 2017, I also felt that neither Chacahua nor myself were actually ready for that adventure yet.As a result, in March 2018, I eventually set off for a new section of my long voyage all the way from Mexico to the very South of Chile and the bottom tip of South America.I drove nearly 30,000 kilometres with two different vehicles over the course of the following two and a half years to get all the way to Punta Arenas (Southern Chile, Magellan Strait, Land of Fire) on March 18th 2020.At that point, the development of the Covid-19 pandemic finally played its life-changing role and, even though I was meant to stay for only a couple of days in Punta Arenas before heading back North through Argentina and Brazil, Argentina closed its borders at that very moment and I eventually got completely stuck at the end of the world for five long months. Of course, that “unwanted” situation (and yet that I had somehow manifested to learn a lesson) induced a very intense personal process, but as everything to me -including the most intense challenges- is just another positive experience that is set to us in order to learn a necessary, meaningful lesson. Indeed, my unexpected stay in Punta Arenas allowed me to use my (lot of) spare time to finish my first book and start organizing my first music & holistic workshop conscious festival in Chacahua, in December 2020 -we will surely get back to that in more details later.Completely losing my freedom and connection with nature for so many months, in the harsh cold of the sub-Antarctic winter, also led me to making the decision to come back to my beloved Mexico and Chacahua (and “Home”) much earlier than what I had thought in the first place, in August 2020. As an allegory of Santiago of the Alchimist (Paolo Cuelho), my journey through central and South America was totally correlated with the idea of discovering and exploring prospective places to get started with my amazing project, but my heart could not be any more convinced that this place was actually Chacahua all along. And, this time, I finally feel totally ready to get started with the Playa Cósmica Project on a broader scale.However, it has not been something easy to fully embrace and accept in the first place, for after having carefully observed, lived and felt the pace of the infrastructural and touristy evolution of Chacahua for the last 6 years, I suddenly and bitterly realized that the exploitation and commercialization of the place has been inexorably more obvious and intense in the last few months than in the last few years, all this in an exponential tempo.Then, as I also realized that not only more and more projects had freshly mushroomed on the little island, but also many new lands were now on sale or sold in the National Park, which means that its inevitable decline and possible extinction has become a real issue to me and many others. For example, it just took a few years for towns like Mazunte, Zipolite or Tulum to develop to such an extent as we know them now (especially when it comes to Tulum) after they started getting more known and being abusively exploited on the real estate level (and on all possible levels actually).Consequently, as I underwent my very own introspective process about the matter, I asked myself whether I actually wanted to be part of this massacre or not, in case I would myself implement my project within the boundaries of the National Park. Yet, I have long learnt how the world works, so I also know that other exclusively money-oriented, ill-intentioned people will probably build fancy resorts within the boundaries of the National Park at some point, which would be much worse for the local wildlife and vegetation. Therefore, I now believe that manifesting the Playa Cosmica Project in Chacahua is actually the “right” thing to do (at least to me) in order to protect the land. Through my own process, I used to be reluctant to this huge responsibility and I have had to accept that this is what I have to and want to do. The Playa Cósmica Project: Originally, the project was named after the “Playa Cosmica Solstice Festival”. It is a free, conscious event I organized in Chacahua for the first time from December 21st to 23rd 2020, and which was a massive accomplishment in itself considering the tremendous impact that Covid-19 has had on this type of events since the pandemic broke out.The festival consists of a mix of holistic workshops during the day and live music at night until sunrise. Since I intend to make this gathering happen at least once a year during the December solstice, it seems very coherent and meaningful to also name the project this way since the festival will be fully part of it far beyond the waves of sound and healing it generates in the meantime. Chacahua is a very magical, cosmic beach and indeed, the idea is to teach trainees a myriad of concrete healing and personal-development tools and techniques through varied courses and retreats, so that the attendees can then practise their new skills and share them during the festival for free.Furthermore, the intention of the Playa Cósmica Project is not only to contribute to the protection of the National Park by buying some land so that people cannot destroy the pristine nature (as it is already taking place) and build fancy resorts on them (as already debated before), but also to eventually relocate the turtle protection centre. In fact, the recent relatively industrial constructions next to the “tortuguero” (turtle center) as well as the overall evolution of Chacahua in the last few months have made me realized that, sadly, this area of the island may be actually swallowed by abusive structural and architectural exploitation in a not-so-distant future, so relocating the turtle protection centre to a further location (as well as the actual location of the Playa Cosmica Project) could be a very effective way to ensure its survival and maintenance in the years to come regardless of how Chacahua evolves in the meantime.Therefore, the Playa Cosmica Solstice Festival (as part of bigger picture of the Playa Cósmica Project) is an efficient, powerful tool to promote the protection of the National Park and local wildlife and I definitely need a little financial support to make all the rest of the magic happen. Furthermore, throughout the year, according to moon cycles and astrological events, courses and retreats will be available on site. The idea is to make them as affordable and inclusive as possible so that they will be accessible to everyone (free for locals).Since many people are eager to learn sustainable living and a holistic approach of medicine (and healing) but they do not know how/what to do, the concept of the Playa Cósmica Project is to teach them how to develop a multitude of interconnected skills that can assist them in reconnecting with their essence, unconditional love and happiness and then share these essential human feelings with others in order to shift the energy frequency of the whole collective consciousness, hence the entire current societal paradigm. The content of the classes/workshops will assist people in learning about how to handle and balance their energies and emotions (as part of the inherent body-mind-spirit balance) so that they can finally integrate that we cannot heal others if we are not ready to be honest with ourselves and heal ourselves in the first place. That we cannot love others if we are not able to love ourselves in the first place and so on and forth. Only then can we understand the meaningfulness of the human experience as a soul and that, despite having a very unique Ride and different paths/missions/functions on this physical plane, we all have the very same potential and choice to manifest abundance in our existence. I have never said it is something easy to do, but it is definitely worth a try. At last, I would like to put a little more emphasis on the communitarian aspect of the Playa Cósmica Project, especially when it comes to the subtle balance of the social interactions and energy exchange through it. The essence of the human experience is all about meeting people and exchanging energies with after all.Throughout my many travels and sustainable-community experiences all over the world, I have noticed that there is often an imbalance between what I consider as the three pillars of how we interact with others and with our direct environment; the intimate interconnection between how we relate to:
The self
Our fellow community members
Nature
 As I use the word “community”, I refer to any types of communities somehow, whether they are sustainable or not, and regardless of the number of its members -the minimum being 2 people, which can makes us wonder and debate about the notion of friendship or “couple” (what I like to call “intimate relationship”, although again, any type of relationship contains love -which can manifest itself in a multitude of fashions, and any type of relationship can possess its very own form of intimacy).Through the rat race of the city life (which I personally also experienced and chose to leave behind at some stage), we tend to be surrounded by a lot of distractions and social pressure which, in turns, tends to disconnect us from nature, hence from our very essence. Maintaining the balance between these three pillars is what supports us in becoming unconditionally happy and satisfied with our existence as well as in love with ourselves therefore with others:
Taking some personal time for ourselves is what makes us process and integrate all our life experiences, lessons and emotions
Taking some collective time to exchange ideas with like-minded people makes us grow, heal and feel human
Taking some time to connect with Mother Nature and the cosmos (whether individually or collectively) changes our perception of the world and teaches us our real place on Earth and in the universe, so that it may facilitate the process of understanding why our soul has decided to come back to this physical plane in this very physical body for this very experience in the here and now.
 The Playa Cósmica Project has three principal research and practice directions: 
Holistic therapy and Psylotherapy (as part of the Mushroom Research Center):I have been studying and practising diverse techniques of physiotherapy (in my quest of re-attuning with the ultimate balance between the East and the West) for the last 20 years. Meanwhile, I have slowly but surely connected with some sacred/psychedelic substances that came to me at some point, although they all came along relatively “late” (at least in terms of physical age), so that I never really felt the need or flow to experience their recreational side like many people do. Yet, it makes sense as I have always felt and believed that these plants and mushrooms have so much more to offer to the world than being used just for “fun”.Very long story cut short, throughout years of practice, I started understanding how to finally combine all the healing tools I had learnt and experienced along the way to develop my very own holistic therapies, which I actually started sharing in Chacahua, in 2016, along with the reconnection with two of the most powerful, accurate and special tools I can share with others, namely astronomy and astrology, whether it has taken place through courses or some other birth chart readings.As I came back to Chacahua from the Chilean Patagonia, in August 2020, I eventually started a new cycle as a holistic therapist. Again, my practice is a combination of many tools (in order to maximize and individualize the process for each and every one of us, including myself), and although I can always give a specific physiotherapy treatment or relaxing massage to someone, the concept of the treatments I usually give to my patients consists of three therapies in one in order to make it as holistic and effective as possible:
Foot reflexology (as part of the Chinese Medicine skills I share and through a fusion of Reiki and reflexology) to work on the organs level, which tend to accumulate lots of subconscious emotions (the best examples of this are the stomach and digestive system when it comes to anxiety). Also, foot reflexology is already a full therapy in itself, during which tremendous exchanges of energy can be felt by both the patient and practitioner, and it opens the energy meridians and prepares the patient's body to receive the following part of the treatment. 
Back therapy and realignment, which has very little to do with a conventional massage for the simple reason that the intention is not only physical (or physiological), but also and especially energetical and emotional. Indeed, healing the three bodies (physical, energetical and emotional) is what allows the therapy to become holistic and to heal people in the deepest and most subconscious (at times even unconscious, generational or karmic) psychosomatic way, as I believe everything is psychosomatic and we do manifest everything that takes place in our lives, including physical injuries and wounds...and physical death. This part of the treatment consists of realigning the spine without any proper osteopathic manipulation, and instead of doing so through Chinese acupuncture points and specific techniques of deep tissue massage on the Bladder Meridian all the way from the hip bone (sacred Yin) to the crown (Cosmic Yang), as well as by working on both the feminine (Yin-left) and masculine (Yang-right) parts of the body to unlock emotional tensions and blockages. Indeed, learning how to “read” someone's back like I did through my own experience gives us a substantial amount of indications about old traumas and blockages that still linger in the physical body (often coming from childhood and/or adolescence), and bringing them back to the surface is what allows me to facilitate their process and integration for the patient. 
Reiki, biomagnetism and the channelling of electro-magnetic energies in the end of the therapy, at the very moment when the physical, energetical and emotional bodies are completely relaxed, attunes and at peace, so that the exchange of energies is more profound and efficient than ever. By the beginning of 2021, I finally felt ready to start giving therapies on psilocybin mushroom micro-dosing, which I had already experienced in some other forms before. After a very promising first experience during which I was on about 0.8 grams of psilocybin mushroom (as a quick reminder, despite the inherent relativity of the concept, a full mushroom journey is usually 3 to 5 grams of dried mushrooms and micro-dosing them usually consists of taking 0.1 to 0.2 grams one day on – one day off (or two days on – one day off) for a period of time that ranges from two to three weeks.During that experience, I could induce sacred-geometry visions in my patient's head, which is what he told me during my traditional feedback time just after the session (according to the notes I take in the meantime, so that I do not disturb the process). Consequently, I started getting very interested in using psilocybin mushroom micro-dosing with some specific patients with a deep emotional or karmic charge, or even those who came to me with rare diseases. For example, I have this 30-ish year-old female English patient who was diagnosed with Crohn disease at 7 years old. Since again, I believe that everything we manifest in our physical body is psychosomatic (which we can prove through Quantum Physics), I do not think that the emotional charge we carry at such young age belongs exclusively in this incarnation and somehow has to come from generational or even karmic patterns. As a result, the psilocybin mushroom micro-dosing with this patient has allowed me to bring some profound emotions back to the “surface” and heal her on a much deeper level than what it would have been with a more conventional therapy, like it has been the case with many other patients ever since.Ultimately, one of the goals of the Playa Cósmica Project is to study the human brain and define some scientific patterns with a carefully-selected (or consciously-manifested) team of competent, open-minded, passionate people in order to develop telepathy (cognitive knowledge-Yang) and empathy (emotions-Yin) with the patients/trainees/attendees. This may seem a little “crazy” and far-fetched, but it is not really so when we eventually understand that we all are a little crazy in our very own way and that the real issue would be not to be aware of that. Also, these concepts are not so far-fetched when we understand the foundations of Quantum Physics and that it is scientifically proven that we can completely change the wiring of our neurons (and, in fact, as we can “rewire” them) and therefore the way we deal both cognitively and emotionally with life.Moreover, my theory is that many people want to “change the world” but we keep on using human words that are heavily charged with millennia of cognitive and emotional nonsense, so we could totally change the way we communicate with our fellow beings through telepathy (which I believe is completely real whenever we connect with others on a more profound level, and I am pretty sure that everyone that will read these lines all the way to that point has already had that amazing feeling), and feeling and listening to our intuition instead of over-thinking “problems” that only exist in our mind. Consequently, this would limit the use of human words and the “negative” routine/energy that is inherently ingrained in them. Only then can we change ourselves and hence the world by setting our most honest, authentic intention into the human collective (and therefore elevate its energy frequency).***This is an extract of my book: “Teacher on the Road – The Five Phases of Death” (2020) “As I started becoming more and more interested in what the true power of our misunderstood brain could be, I realised that its volume has not evolved for the last 230,000 years, and since the appearance of Homo Neanderthalensis (over a 2 million-year timespan, the volume of the brain went from 600 cm3 with Homo Habilis, to 1680 cm3 with Homo Neanderthalensis, which is its actual current size). I also figured out that, “coincidentally”, psilocybin (psychoactive) mushrooms began being used in sacred rituals all over the world approximately 230,000 years ago (cave-paintings and other visionary art date back to about 40,000 years ago, but this is not incompatible with the idea that whoever made them built on an already existing legacy of even more ancient and probably less outwardly-“expressive” rituals). Fungi are also intriguing because the connections between their cells are very similar to the axonal and synaptic connections between the neurons of the human brain. In 1998, a bunch of scientists discovered that fungi split from animals about 1.538 billion years ago, whereas plants split from animals about 1.547 billion years ago. This means fungi split from animals about 9 million years after plants did, which entails that fungi are actually more closely related to animals (and therefore to humans) than plants are. Also, it has been scientifically proven that the mycelium (the underground “root” system of mushrooms) connects all trees and plants together, through a gigantic network of trillions of smart cells, that can be compared to the workings of the human brain.We also know that every single fungus has a specific function: some, like Turkey Tail, are 8 times more efficient than chemotherapy for curing cancer, and others, like psilocybin mushrooms and Lion's Mane, facilitate the neuron-genesis process (in other words, the rebirth and growth of neurons in the brain, which could help cure diseases or psychological conditions such as Alzheimer, schizophrenia, psychosis, addictions or depression) - and this all in a natural, chemical-free way-. So it is not actually so far-fetched to think that their consumption could have had a huge impact on the evolution of humanity.As Terrence McKenna and Graham Hancock also suggested in their respective researches, I believe not only that psychedelic mushrooms are very likely to have induced the very first form of religion and spirituality in our evolution, hundreds of thousands of years ago, but it is also very plausible that the human brain tripled in size (from Homo Habilis to Homo Neanderthalensis) because of these hundreds of thousands of years of regular consumption of psilocybin mushrooms. It is even possible that the human brain has stopped growing ever since, because mushroom consumption has been quite misunderstood and repressed throughout our more recent history. And yet, even though this is a very acceptable theory regarding human evolution (especially in a Darwinian perspective), it remains merely a theory -the “Stoned Ape Theory”, as Terrence McKenna named it-, like there are many others out there, and it is up to each and every one of us to do our own critical, independent research about this topic. For my part, not only do I find this theory very plausible, but I also believe that ancient civilisations had become very advanced with regards to both Science and Spirit, all over the world, because of their regular intake of psychoactive substances, and that the crisis of consciousness we are experiencing today is somehow connected with the permanent repression that sacred, ancestral plants have been subjected to in the last decades. Indeed, all medicinal, healing substances such as mushrooms (psilocybin), Peyote (mescaline), San Pedro (mescaline), Ayahuasca (DMT), marijuana (THC-CBD), or even LSD (which is a semi-synthetic substance, that nonetheless originated in nature -actually from another mushroom, the rye ergot fungus- and has been scientifically proven to have many healing effects, if taken with respect and awareness), have been incessantly labelled as “dangerous, useless hard drugs” (such as cocaine or heroin), and, consequently, the true potential they may have to explore and understand the meaning and purpose of our existence on this physical plane has been utterly dismissed. Of course, this is all theory, and I felt like I needed to experiment with it for myself. I ingested some mushrooms for the first time in Amsterdam, in 2003, and it did not end up being an outstanding experience. However, I tried them again after I came back from Australia, in 2008, with my friend Carole, and later in Amsterdam (again) as I lived there, and these times, it was the most insightful, meaningful experience ever, during which I was so lucid and clear-minded that I truly felt like my comprehension of consciousness was able to reach a whole new depth. I could process so much information all at once that I could finally grasp the intrinsic beauty of our connection with nature and the entire cosmos timelessly.This knowledge and wisdom are always there, but they are usually not accessible to us because we are so distracted and mind-oriented all the time. These sacred substances may actually contain many existential answers that we all seek sooner or later, and may allow us to accept their consequences too, especially when it comes to interconnectedness, destiny, synchronicity, or even to unconditional love, faith, and the immortality of the soul. After all, even when it comes to Prince Siddharta; who can say if he did not, in fact, find and ingest a few psilocybin mushrooms around while he was meditating under his famous Bodhi tree for 40 consecutive days, which facilitated and enhanced his “enlightenment” process (after which he would become known as the Buddha)?” I have always been fascinated by all types of mushrooms since I was a young child even if it is only much later, in 2015, that I profoundly reconnected with them. Since then, I have studied, picked and experienced them quite substantially, like many other fields.After I stayed in a mushroom community and research centre in Guatemala, in 2017, it could not be any clearer that one of my purposes would be to implement my very own mushroom research centre somewhere, someday. And I believe that Chacahua is the perfect place for that since it is such a powerful, ceremonial energy vortex. The idea is to use psilocybin and other non-psychedelic medicinal mushrooms in a micro-dosing as well as full-journey perspective in order to study their effects onto the human body and brain, as well as onto energies and emotions, and hence to reconnect with the ultimate balance between the body, mind and Spirit. The Astronomy Observation Center:This is another extract of my book: “Teacher on the Road – The Five Phases of Death” (2020) “I do not believe in a specific God, but I actually do believe in the Universe as a whole, as everything and everyone comes from the same substance. We are Its atomic and chemical extensions, and are made out of recycled star matter, and so is everything around us. Subsequently, we are inexorably connected with Its energetic pulse in this physical “dimensity” (a “portmanteau word” that I like using in order to communicate the meaningful marriage between “dimension” and “immensity”).Therefore, listening to our heart and intuitions in order to make choices allows us to get closer to some form of spirituality, or at least to whatever suits each and every one of us on our respective paths, both on an individual and collective level. As to all the things that are not up to us to control; I believe that our purpose in life is to embrace the Unknown of our own Path, so our heartbeats can tune and lean into the rhythm and flow of Its eternal, ethereal cosmic energies. At age 11, as I entered middle-school, I had the opportunity to start studying Astronomy. Our ancestors -knowledgeable, wise and advanced in the subject as they were- often considered it to be the Mother of all Sciences. It was such a beautiful synchronicity to end up in the only middle-school in France (named “Paul Valery”, in Nice) that actually possessed a planetarium in its yard, with an Astronomy club and classes available on site for those pupils who chose to include the subject in their curriculum, along with the more common ones such as Mathematics, Literature, Physical Education or languages.As a consequence, by age 13, some of my geeky buddies and I were already able to give lectures and planetarium sessions for adults, with the accompanying stories from Greek mythology about the starry Southern night sky. During my eighth grade, when pupils had to pick a place (association, shop, company or institution) to do a compulsory apprenticeship as part of the grade's syllabus, I proudly became the first pupil ever to do my two-week training at the renowned Observatory of Nice (the oldest in Europe, built by Eiffel in the 1880s). After I had brilliantly completed my training there, it seemed only logical to become an astrophysicist and make a career for myself in this field. On the one hand, my ego seemed to be very satisfied with this idea, but on the other, my heart was telling me that I also had some other important passions to embrace in this life, instead of rigorously completing an Astronomy PhD for ten years, just to then lock myself in a lab or be stuck in front of a computer all day long for the following decades. I realised that becoming an astrophysicist would actually take me light years away from what I loved in Astronomy itself; since the latter is just a tiny fraction of what we can See of the complex cosmos that lies both outside and inside of everyone.Instead of becoming a professional in this nonetheless fascinating subject, I just wanted to remain a passionate star gazer and wanderer of consciousness, so I swiftly gave up on the idea, which most probably was the first massive disappointing blow I induced to my parents' expectations. Meanwhile, it has not prevented me from feeling at Home and at peace, whenever I am gazing at my celestial Sisters. I have never really been able to explain why exactly I started studying Astronomy or Astrology so young (I bought my first Astrology book at age 14), aside from the beautiful synchronicity that has made my knowledge the intriguing melting-pot it is now. Exploring these fascinating, ancestral subjects has been a great eye- (and heart-) opener to the world that surrounds me, and I later understood that all details of our existence are intimately connected with one another, even the tiniest things we do every day, or the persons we meet for the briefest moments - which is what the magic of travelling is all about. After all, this is how I have come all the way to the point of writing these lines right now. And yet, publishing a book for others has never been a purpose in itself; I would already be delighted to have the possibility to read what I have written in 10 or 20 years from now, in order to see how I have evolved and grown in the meantime, or else how efficient I have been at learning the lessons I have come here to learn. Furthermore, I have always been utterly captivated by the idea that, although ancient civilisations did not supposedly communicate with one another (at least according to mainstream history, for they were supposedly scattered all over the world, in different points of space and time), they all still discovered the same very advanced astronomical knowledge. In the last hundred years, with “modern” science, our civilisation has just merely confirmed what they had already explored and assimilated millennia ago.How were they able to achieve such a mastery of advanced knowledge and wisdom, when they were supposed to be modest hunters and berry pickers?I will avoid getting too much into the details of how relevant (or irrelevant) the commonly-accepted version of history as we know it truly is, for now. But to shortly answer my own question, I reckon that the knowledge of Astronomy, in particular, that these (supposedly) “primitive” people had, stemmed from their deep connection to Mother Earth and the Universe as a whole, which was not yet tainted by the multitude of environmental distractions that afflict us all so much nowadays. As I worked as a general educator at Ségurane Middle-School, in Nice, in 2008 and 2009, I set up an Astronomy club with the assistance and support of a dear friend of mine, Carole, whose spiritual evolution seemed to parallel my own. We were both educators when we met, in 2008, and she soon became a Mathematics teacher, while I became an English teacher.Yet, we had (and still have) Astronomy and Astrophysics as common passions, and it was essential for us to share these as well as pass on the message of the stars to our pupils. This experience then became an amazing achievement, which allowed both of us to delve even deeper into the understanding of our intimate connection with the Universe through the concepts of infinite space and time. Indeed, the reach of “infinite” is usually too unfathomable and intangible for our brains to perceive, since in our society, it was never trained to integrate such mind-bugging scales. This is why I started digging down the rabbit hole in the first place, both outside and inside, so that I may find some answers I had long been looking for.” I have long realized that astronomy and astrology are two of the most amazing skills I can share with others, and this one of the reasons why I want to teach these growing tools with my fellow human beings. Another reason is that they are two very powerful, meaningful fields that can change one's perception of the world ad the universe. Since we are the Universe both inside and outside, this process has to go in a mutual, balanced way both outwardly and inwardly, which means that understanding astronomy and astrology assist us in understanding ourselves, hence others. The Diving Research Centre:As a Dive Master and a passionate individual about the seas and oceans of the world, and throughout my considerable free-diving and scuba-diving experience since 2003, I have always believed that the concept of diving goes way beyond the number of metres we explore beneath the surface of the water. Paradoxically enough, I have never been willing to work in the scuba-diving industry because I have always believed that there is so much more to diving and taking a bunch of tourists down into the Big Blue and ruining its bottom for the sake of money.First of all, since we humans are made of about 70% of water, diving reconnects us simply with what we are. Also, in astrology, the water element (and water signs; Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces) connects us with our deepest emotions, esoterism and all our spiritual and metaphysical ideals, therefore with our sensibility, vulnerability and feminine divine that we all possess in equal amount in the first place on the energy level.Also, diving initiates and familiarizes us with the discovery of a new material world, which assists us in facing our fears when it comes to accepting the “unknown” and things we cannot control and want to let go of in our lives. Also, the different perception of gravity and being completely surrounded with water takes us back to where everything started (at least without going back all the way to the stardust stage), which is our mother's womb. As a result, diving is a wonderful way to indulge a nurturing and peaceful feeling to deal with our most profound traumas and emotions in order to process them, integrate them, therefore to heal them. Playa Cósmica Retreats Goal: To give a broad spectrum of concrete, complementary, useful “tools” and skills to the trainees in order to thrive in both their human and spiritual experience, at an affordable price. Why?Most courses and retreats are usually very specific, and offer services that are very intense throughout a very short period of time. This retreat explores many topics and teaches the trainees how to interconnect them in order to understand the bigger picture of the big Cosmic Puzzle we live in, and to give them more time for setting their intention and integration and for coherent, practical application into their daily life.Not only is this retreat a profound introspection of the world inside and outside to assimilate it better, but it is also a wonderful insight to maintain and balance the attendees' energetical space ever after. Consequently, they can (re)connect with their original essence, potential and equilibrium between the body, the mind and the spirit. This process is conveyed through the permanent motion and emotional process of the moon cycles, and through their intimate energetical connection with the elemental equilibrium inside and outside of us. How long?Technically, retreats as I perceive them can be very short (at least for a couple of days, like I did a few times when I was living in Ecuador and Peru) or much longer depending on what is their emotional and energetical intention and purpose.Nevertheless, I am going to remain focused on the 30-day retreat I would like to manifest through the Playa Cósmica Project.Thirty days are an entire moon cycle (the moon orbit around the Earth is 27.25 days – sideral period - but the full phasing cycle is about 29.5 days – sinodic period-, since the sun is also moving in the sky according to the Earth's orbit around it). Or from one new moon to the following one.In astrology, we are influenced by many cosmic aspects at the same time, and they start long before we were born in this life and they keep going long after we depart from it. Yet, the celestial body that rules our life on a daily basis is the moon, because it represents the fluctuation of our emotional body, the core of our unique personality. The moon remains for approximately 2.3 days in each and every of the 12 signs of the Zodiac and their element (fire, earth, air or water) during each and every of its cycles around the Earth. Therefore, the practice and activities during the retreat follow the signs of the zodiac, hence their respective elements and their specific attributes.It is important to note that the moon not only influences the way we feel and behave, but it also incarnates the feminine divine within us. Although it particularly impacts women on the physiological level (through the menstruation cycle), it is also fundamental to understand that this process is not just all about the physical gender. Yes, men experience emotional menstruation as well, because the moon impacts the 70-ish% of water that compose our physical body as much as it does with the tidal cycles of the oceans.Since water is the element that most incarnate our emotions and feelings, the influence of the Queen of the Night has overall very little to do regarding whether we are a woman or a man (again, aside from the massive physiological aspect of it, of course, for it is absolutely no coincidence that the moon revolution around the Earth and a regular menstruation cycle both last for 28 days).Overall, we all do have a feminine and a masculine side as part of our primordial Yin (feminine)-Yang (masculine) balance, and understanding how it works (and how intensely we're connected with astrological events at all times) is a fantastic tool to understand the subtleties of how we connect with this physical plane throughout our human experience. What?The different 'tools' that are included in the course are divided into 4 modules according to their nature, as each of them is inherently related to one of the 4 elements of Greek astrology (like for any other activity or emotion in our daily reality, as well as our very own essence or 'personality'). As such, each day of the course will revolve around one or multiple activities from the module related to the elemental moon transit of that specific day. Note: It doesn't mean that if the moon element of the day is earth, the courses will involve more earth (or more grounding). Indeed, since the intent of the retreat is all about reconnecting with a form of personal and collective (or inner and outer) balance, an 'earth' day is actually perfect to work with one of the other 3 elements.Then, it is all about the experiment of the process, for the outcome may be very different for each and every of the participants, including for the teachers. [Trainee's predominant chart's element (out of 11 aspects) -A- + his/her chart's moon element -B-] + [specific day's predominant element (out of 10 aspects) -C- + its moon element -D-] = Elemental tool of the dayFor instance: [Fire -A- + Earth -B- ] + [Fire -C- + Air -D- ] = [(+) (Yang) + (-) (Yin)] + [(+) (Yang) + (+) (Yang)] = 0 Yin + (2+) Yang = (2+)Yang = elemental tools/activities of the day in Earth or Water (in Yin) in order to counter-balance and channel efficiently this person's energy and astrological influence of a specific day (or period of time/cycle) Of course, since each trainee's chart is personal, the sun, moon and planetary transits will all differ from one another, and the course curriculum can only be based on the predominant element of the day (or of the course) and its moon element (2nd half of the equation).Nonetheless, we still believe this will provide the participants with useful insight into the ruling of the sun, moon, planets and of the elements upon their personal and collective energies. It will also teach the trainees how to make the most of the overall astrological influence on a daily basis, especially as it is paired with sufficient, concrete knowledge and practice regarding many other compatible, complementary skills, taught by experienced and qualified teachers. How?200-hour retreat (theory + practical activities)5 days/week theory + practice (about 8 hours)1 day/week exclusively practice (about 8 hours) + feedback + sharing circle + staff meeting1 day/week completely off (+ silent day + optional fasting) + fun activities (photo-plancton + surf, …) Content specifics (this is an example and may be subjected to some adjustments at some stage): 1) Module 1 (WATER): 50 hours36 hours morning yoga (6 classes/week X 1.5 hours) (9 hours for each element's specific flow -fire, earth, air, water-) for all levels6 hours yoga anatomy/physiology2 hours yoga intention (goals of Asanas on energy level & channeling)4 hours emotional development2 hours conscious nutrition 2) Module 2 (AIR): 50 hours36 hours Greek astrology theory + practice (how to read/interpret an astral chart + planetary transits)4 hours Mayan & Chinese astrology theory + practice10 hours astronomy + Greek mythology stories + find your way across the sky 3) Module 3 (EARTH): 50 hours40 hours holistic medicine/Chinese medicine, therapeutic massage & acupressure theory + practice (+ energy meridians)4 hours aromatherapy (theory + practice)2 hours medicinal mushrooms & psychedelic mushrooms + micro-dosing + ceremony2 hours tincture making (theory + practice)2 hours cacao ceremony theory (+ ceremony/ecstatic dance practice for full moon) 4) Module 4 (FIRE): 50 hours20 hours reiki level I & II (breathing + chakras + meditation + pendulum) & practice20 hours holistic physiotherapy (+protection/cleansing/crystals/music/mushrooms therapy)4 hours tantra (+ “shadow work” + emotional honesty practice)2 hours meditation/breathing work theory (practice part of yoga classes)2 hours sound therapy (practice part of yoga/holistic therapy)2 hours quantum physics + law of manifestation debate Extras: - 1 cacao ceremony/Ecstatic dance every week (upon moon phases/other astrological events)Certificates in Chinese medicine, astrology, reiki, yoga, aromatherapy***Overall, the goal of this campaign is to collect 150,000 US dollars, which is the total amount of money I have calculated and budgeted for the price of land, construction and development of the Playa Cósmica Holistic Centre.Let me tell you a bit more about how it works and how you can contribute to the Playa Cósmica Project. There are 2 ways through which you can donate by choosing one of the perks of the campaign:Not only can you make a financial contribution of your choice, but you can also “donate” 2,000 dollars as you actually book your place for one of my one-month holistic retreats at the future Playa Cósmica – Holistic Centre in Chacahua, which you will have actually contributed to build by booking your place in advance!As I would like to start building the place in October or November 2021, the first retreat is planned to happen in September 2022. Then, there will be 3 other retreats planned each time through the solstices or equinoxes (November through December 2022, February through March 2023 and May through June 2023). The idea would be to collect 64,000 USD with the retreats given that there are 8 participants maximum in total per retreat and that each place is worth a 2,000-USD “donation” for the construction and development of the Playa Cósmica Holistic Centre. Be aware that this price is all inclusive (room, food, courses and ceremonies), as the idea of these retreats is to make them meaningful, insightful, efficient and financially accessible all at once. Thank you so much for reading me and somehow sharing my life experience with me through these lines, and I really say that from the very depths of my heart and soul. If you have made it all the way until this point, you may actually be very interested in the Playa Cósmica Project, and you may even want to contribute to its success (although we all know that ""success"" is a very relative concept indeed).In order to be completely honest and transparent regarding how your money is going to be used and exchanged (in terms of services and energies, as I do believe in karma), be reassured that your donation will be exclusively used for the Playa Cósmica Project. I do also believe in our tremendous power of manifestation as soon as our intention is honest and authentic, and I am utterly convinced that this project will somehow get started at some stage within the next few months. Because it has already started as you read these few lines after all, and I believe in its totally innovative, visionary and even revolutionary aspects and concepts, as well as I believe that it could be set as an example of how humanity can co-exist and thrive in an efficient and sustainable way in a not-so-distant future. This project may be part of the next step in the evolution of humanity and we may become part of this exciting paradigm shift all together.Thank you so much again for your support, trust and love.Best, Nicolas GennaTeacher on the Road Instagram: teacherontheroad_Youtube: Nicolas Genna - Teacher on the Roadwww.teacherontheroad.com",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>We Are Reimagining the Village and Need Your Support</h3>
<p>Help us raise $100,000 to support our expansion and vision for the future.</p>
<p>My name is Kikanza Ramsey-Ray and I am the founder, director, and one of the lead teachers at Village Playgarden and Wildseed Regenerative Farm; a developmentally lead Waldorf inspired early childhood community, childcare, and farm forest kindergarten. After years as a frontlines community organizer in the struggle for social justice, I became a Waldorf early childhood educator as an addition to my commitment to working toward a better world. With my family of 7; including my 87 year old grandmother, mother, husband , and three children, we set out to create a magical safe space to educate and care for young children and their families. 13 years ago I birthed this dream to call together a multigenerational intentional community in order to serve humanity through all of the stages of development starting with our youngest humans.  Village Playgarden is our flagship program. We offer a rich land based early childhood experience for children 2 through 6 years old in the traditions of Lifeways Waldorf early childhood education, anti-biased/anti-racist curriculum, nonviolent conscious parenting, place based education, and regenerative farming.  Our land is also home to Arising Homeschool Collective supporting homeschooling middle schoolers co-founded by Adalila Zelada Hopkins; Mountainside summer wilderness program; and a host of enrichment offerings to parents and people of all ages.  We are living, farming, and creating on three campuses on sacred Tongva land, at the foot of the San Gabriel Mountains in Altadena California, which is the multi-acre land base of our two early childhood homes, Wildseed Farm, and our forest kindergarten.</p>
<p>After 13 successful years, Village Playgarden, Wildseed Regenerative Farm and all of its’ programs are at a crossroads. Covid-19 global pandemic stopped our rich in person programming for 7 months, stopped our tuition based income, and caused an economic crisis in our work. Our response has been to come back even stronger in our commitment to build equitable, just, and multigenerational sustainable community from the roots up. To that end, we invested our savings, bartered and borrowed to rebuild enough all outdoor Covid conscious infrastructure to get the doors re-opened.  Our re-opening has been a healing experience where children, though needing to observe Covid safety, have been able to have developmentally supportive experiences where they can thrive at a time when so many children have lost their communities of children, and forced to try to learn on digital platforms.</p>
<p>We now need your support for the additional infrastructure that is necessary to Reimagine the Village and run our programs 100% outdoors so we can continue to be a place where children and their families can learn, grown, create, and build community that is deeply socially connected. Your donation will save the Village, protect and transform its programming, and support the expansion of our work as a model for conscious community building.</p>

<h3>Urban Barn Raising For Our Farm Forest School and Community</h3>
<p>What your contribution will support:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to purchase all weather tensiled roofs and outdoor heaters for cooler temperatures, rain, and sun. As the new infrastructure was built with donated labor, deferred payments, and just enough bones to get the program open, there are necessary finishing touches that we need immediately. </li>
<li>We need one more storage shed and one more composting toilet in the Forest School. In our commitment to environmental sustainability, we have built composting toilets in the Village Playgarden Skylane yard. We ran out of funds and steam to build a composting toilet in the Forest School, and so have been using a port-o-potty.  The children in the forest class need their own composting toilet and a storage shed for their cubbies and belongings.  </li>
<li>We need to build a structure for storing and processing the bounty from Wildseed Farm.</li>
<li>We need the funds for licensing, zoning, and modest remodeling of the new Canon Trail house, Village’s new site. We are in the enrollment period of new families for the upcoming school year, and have received enough applicants to fill all three sites. This will at least double the amount of families that we serve.  In addition to meeting the high demand from families who want the quality early childhood experience and care that Village Playgarden has provided for the past 13 years; increasing the enrollment is a significant element of our ability to survive.  </li>
<li>We need funds to protect and increase living wage compensation for teachers. We brought back all of our teachers in our reopening, and have worked to maintain salaries, raises, and offer benefits. In addition, with the expansion, our faculty and staff will increase significantly. We are committed to validating and honoring the work of teachers and early childhood caregivers, a profession that is dominated by women and people of color, in ways that are not typically financially protected in our society.  </li>
<li>We need funds to sustain the increased staffing. We hired four new full time and part-time teachers, a part time admin assistant, a bookkeeper, and a cook/director of the Farm to Table Healthy Food Program. We are required to have a larger than normal ratio in order to keep small “podded” groups of children as part of the state’s mandated Covid protocols. This raises our budget and expenses significantly. In addition, our growth is a source of providing a living wage job and career that offers, training and professional development, a noble profession, and a peaceful respectful place to work.  </li>
<li>We need funds to continue our commitment to professional development for all of our teachers so that we can lead a quality farm forest all outdoor program rooted in Waldorf early childhood education and the values of equity, inclusion, diversity, anti-racism, justice, and nonviolence. </li>
<li>We need funds to launch an Equity, Inclusion, Diversity, and Justice Scholarship Fund, and continue to grow the work of inclusion as rooted in the original vision and work of Kikanza and Geoff when founding Village Playgarden. We are committed to specific diversity and inclusion goals, and are working to deepen these values so that they are at the institutional and structural level at Village Playgarden, living in our community culture and composition beyond the ideas, hopes, and aspirations of Geoff and Kikanza. We would like the entire Village community to help support the cost of making sure that categories of diversity are protected and that includes making sure that there are financial resources available to simultaneously fund the cost of the program while at the same time make sure that access is available for families and children that experience barriers to inclusion. </li>
<li>We need funds to continue growing the farming infrastructure such as a harvesting processing station, farm to table community pavilion, and land maintenance workshop so that we can continue to offer the land-based regenerative farming education to the children and the community, and grow the organic/biodynamic bounty of crops that we use to feed the children and offer to charitable organizations that feed hungry people in our community.</li>
</ul>
<p>Village Playgarden and Wildseed Farm is committed to helping to raise a new generation of healthy, confident, capable children. We are committed to supporting families in their children’s foundational years. We are committed to being a model for land-based, nature loving, sustainable, antiracist, nonviolent, multigenerational communities. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>At Peer To Peer we aim to help children learn in a fun and realistic yet in a safe manner. Our program focuses on 3 main things, writing, reading and listening and I believe to a great extent that this program will help our children in many ways. What do we actually do? We pair children from different country up carefully according to their age group. They will communicate with each other through writing letters (just like how we did in the past), and also record themselves reading the letter on a cassette! How nostalgic for us but its a whole new experience for our young generation. </li>
<li>Contributors will definitely help to kick-start our program. The funds raised will be used to buy materials (pens/letters/cassettes) for our children as well as children who can't afford resources. Each child will receive a 'goodie' bag comprising of the materials needed which is a pen, a stack of letter templates, a cassette recorder with a tape. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>At this stage we have just over 140,000 students waiting to start this program in less developed Countries. We are needing to raise $1,000,000 to be able to kick start this project and supply the required resources to the children in need and yet eager to learn.</li>
<li>The funds raised will be solely used to buy items such as pens, paper, envelopes, cassette tape recorders and cassette tapes.</li>
<li>You helping us reach this goal means you are helping at least 30,000 students out of the 140,000 students get a kick start on this venture and the opportunity for them to learn. </li>
<li>If the goal is not reached the funds raised will go towards helping at least orphanages get the opportunity to kick start this program. Building this program with passion was my main aim to provide a very fun and interactive way of teaching and connecting children all around the world.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>This project is valuable in the sense that it will keep children physically writing and improving their handwriting skills, as well as encourage them to read and listen to their peers. Improving skills that they need in life and also helping them connect to how we use to learn back in the 1990s. </li>
<li>This project helps children learn about different cultures, connecting them with children of same ages in a different country.</li>
<li>Children will get the opportunity to experience connecting with peers through airmail and how it feels to excitedly wait for a response. </li>
<li>I have created an exchange program, one of a kind with a big vision to connect children and teach them patience and understanding of one another. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>One of the biggest challenges that this program will face is language barrier but I feel as an experienced past teacher that our program can show children that everyone learns at a different pace. As well as educating children who are in advanced countries that their peer needs their help in learning too, so what better way for them to teach each other that understanding and patience is important.</li>
<li>Another challenge I foresee is that children will get bored of just writing, therefore I plan to keep our program exciting by hosting Video meetings, as well as monthly challenges where children will get to bring out their inner creativity and write their own stories as well as publishing it. </li>
<li>I foresee this program as a success if parents can play a small part by helping their child with the letter writing and letter recording. It will be a valuable session of parent-child bonding. Parents can also get to share how they have wrote letters and recorded on their cassettes in the past. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>Even if you can't contribute to this cause spreading the word about this program will also be a huge help. In advance I want to thank you for taking the time to read.</li>

<font size=""6""><strong>Over:</strong>View</font><p><br/>Hi, I'm Ross and I am a qualified software and hardware engineer working in the industry for over 20 years. After years of wanting to combine two of my loves: the wealth of available components, peripherals and accessories of the PC world with the flexibility, customisability and community support of the Raspberry Pi, I have designed a mini-ITX carrier board for the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4.

</ul>
</div><div>
<br/><font size=""6""><strong>Over:</strong>Prepared</font><p><br/>The design is ready to go and is built up from the Raspberry Pi CMIO 4 board schematic and extended to include more PC-centric components and engineered for maximum compatibility with Mini-ITX, Micro-ATX and ATX cases and PC peripherals.</p>
<p>The first thing to do is to prototype the design. My intention is to get 3 manufacturers to make 6 prototype boards each. I will select the highest quality board for the pre-production run. With 2 of the boards from each manufacturer I will use them for testing, marketing and development. One board will be given away in a competition/raffle. The remaining 11 boards will be sent to Early-backers as reward for their support. To cover the cost of this the 11 boards will require a contribution of £199 each.</p>
<p>If any discrepancies are found or tweaks to the design are required this will then be performed prior to pre-production. I will then order 50-100 boards (depending on demand) as a trial run at production, these boards will come in prototype retail packaging with prototype documentation and an I/O backplate. To cover the cost of this stage of development the pre-production boards will need a backing contribution of £149 each. One of these boards will also be given away in a competition/raffle.</p>
<p>Following the successful distribution of the pre-production boards I will then (again demand permitting) order a larger quantity of boards in a full production batch. This is where I hope to get the cost down as low as possible with a target price of £99 (if it's more then backers still get it for £99). Grab it now for this guaranteed price.<br/> </p>
<font size=""6""><strong>Over:</strong>Engineered</font><p><br/>I've lost count exactly how many, but this will be about my 35th commercial electronics PCB to be manufactured, so I am no stranger to getting these things to market. That said however, this will be the first of my own venture so represents my most exciting project to date and something I feel very passionate about.</p>
<p>If enough other people feel as excited by the idea of this project as I do then I think getting this product to market will be straight-forward enough with their support and with the endless support of the Raspberry Pi community. The design is done, checked and double-checked and is ready for prototyping. After successful testing and (if necessary) tweaking the pre-production stage will then be used to streamline the systems and processes required for mass-production, retail and after-sales support, working closely with the chosen manufacturer on optimal selection of components (substitute for most readily available and alternatives for future runs should it become necessary) and the Raspberry Pi community for support.</p>
</div><div>
<p>With a bit of luck and hard work everyone will love their <strong>Over</strong>:Board and in-turn their Raspberry Pi PC, the communities can combine and expand even more and a whole new world of educational and enthusiast electronics will begin!<br/> </p>
<font size=""6""><strong>Over:</strong>Exposure</font><p><br/><strong>Competition</strong>: I am giving away one of the prototype boards to the winner of the first competition. The winner will be chosen at random once the Indiegogo campaign ends. To enter the competition either:<br/><br/>A) follow @OverDevices on Twitter and retweet the competition post<br/>B) follow @OverDevices on Instagram and share the competition post to your story</p>
<p>If you do both, you will be entered into the competition twice!<br/><br/>If you'd like to see this project succeed but don't feel ready to support financially and you know someone who might, please spread the word as much as you can. If you or anyone you know can offer any other type of support then I would be more than grateful to hear from you, so please do get in touch!</p>

Broadcom BCM2711 quad-core Cortex-A72 (ARM v8) 64-bit SoC @ 1.5GHz
H.265 (HEVC) (up to 4Kp60 decode), H.264 (up to 1080p60 decode, 1080p30 encode) 
OpenGL ES 3.0 graphics
Options for 1GB, 2GB, 4GB or 8GB LPDDR4-3200 SDRAM (depending on variant)
Options for 0GB (""Lite""), 8GB, 16GB or 32GB eMMC Flash memory (depending on variant)
Option for fully certified radio module: 2.4 GHz, 5.0 GHz IEEE 802.11 b/g/n/ac wireless; Bluetooth 5.0, BLE;


Over:PreparedThe design is ready to go and is built up from the Raspberry Pi CMIO 4 board schematic and extended to include more PC-centric components and engineered for maximum compatibility with Mini-ITX, Micro-ATX and ATX cases and PC peripherals.
The first thing to do is to prototype the design. My intention is to get 3 manufacturers to make 6 prototype boards each. I will select the highest quality board for the pre-production run. With 2 of the boards from each manufacturer I will use them for testing, marketing and development. One board will be given away in a competition/raffle. The remaining 11 boards will be sent to Early-backers as reward for their support. To cover the cost of this the 11 boards will require a contribution of £199 each.
If any discrepancies are found or tweaks to the design are required this will then be performed prior to pre-production. I will then order 50-100 boards (depending on demand) as a trial run at production, these boards will come in prototype retail packaging with prototype documentation and an I/O backplate. To cover the cost of this stage of development the pre-production boards will need a backing contribution of £149 each. One of these boards will also be given away in a competition/raffle.
Following the successful distribution of the pre-production boards I will then (again demand permitting) order a larger quantity of boards in a full production batch. This is where I hope to get the cost down as low as possible with a target price of £99 (if it's more then backers still get it for £99). Grab it now for this guaranteed price. 
Over:EngineeredI've lost count exactly how many, but this will be about my 35th commercial electronics PCB to be manufactured, so I am no stranger to getting these things to market. That said however, this will be the first of my own venture so represents my most exciting project to date and something I feel very passionate about.
If enough other people feel as excited by the idea of this project as I do then I think getting this product to market will be straight-forward enough with their support and with the endless support of the Raspberry Pi community. The design is done, checked and double-checked and is ready for prototyping. After successful testing and (if necessary) tweaking the pre-production stage will then be used to streamline the systems and processes required for mass-production, retail and after-sales support, working closely with the chosen manufacturer on optimal selection of components (substitute for most readily available and alternatives for future runs should it become necessary) and the Raspberry Pi community for support.

With a bit of luck and hard work everyone will love their Over:Board and in-turn their Raspberry Pi PC, the communities can combine and expand even more and a whole new world of educational and enthusiast electronics will begin! 
Over:ExposureCompetition: I am giving away one of the prototype boards to the winner of the first competition. The winner will be chosen at random once the Indiegogo campaign ends. To enter the competition either:A) follow @OverDevices on Twitter and retweet the competition postB) follow @OverDevices on Instagram and share the competition post to your story
If you do both, you will be entered into the competition twice!If you'd like to see this project succeed but don't feel ready to support financially and you know someone who might, please spread the word as much as you can. If you or anyone you know can offer any other type of support then I would be more than grateful to hear from you, so please do get in touch!
Thank you for reading my campaign and stay safe.

We are Ahhyun, Kokoro, Len, Hinah, and Tomo, a team of five Sophia University students. We conduct self-empowerment and leadership workshops for youth across Japan. RISE MissionRISE was created by students for students. Our mission is to enable youth to become changemakers by building their creative confidence and lighting the path into the realm of unknown possibilities.  Why we started RISE:Most people care about what they leave TO the next generation. At RISE, we care about what we leave WITHIN them!We want to inspire and help youth build the self-confidence they need to explore their purpose, pursue their passion and envision their own dream of enacting social change in their communities. That's why we will set out around Japan this summer to engage with young students through carefully designed self-empowerment and leadership workshops. How we will create impact: We will be travelling across Japan for six weeks starting from August 2021 to deliver our workshops. In preparation, over the past year we have built up our skills by hosting workshops for our fellow students. For this roadtrip we have already confirmed over 10 youth communities and scheduled more than 15 workshops in 10 prefectures. We have partnered up with Girl Possible, an experienced US-based NPO that teaches leadership skills to young girls in the US. They have not only inspired us to do the same for young students in Japan, but have also provided us with invaluable advice on delivering our own workshops.We are excited to expand our impact to a national level and engage with the hundreds of middle school and high school students awaiting us!! Please make a donation to help us reach them! Why are we doing this? & Why does this matter?Today we are living through fast changing and challenging times that can feel overwhelming. But this is also a time of opportunities and we want the youth to see that. RISE is a dedication to our younger selves, and those moments when we didn’t know what our future would hold for us.All of us had role models that encouraged us at different stages to follow our own passions and strive to create impact in the communities we live in. Now, we want to do the same for the youth in Japan.We deeply resonated with Girl Possible’s framing of this workshop. Just like them, we believe that asking young students what they want to do in the future is not the best approach. Instead we need to ask them, ""What kind of change do you want to create in the world, and how can you begin to achieve that dream today?""We also believe the design thinking mindset, method and tools have the power to enable social change. We have had the opportunity to be immersed in design thinking during our training at the Hasso Plattner Institute and the Stanford University Innovation Fellows programs and we have felt empowered by it. In the past year we have also created and conducted several design thinking workshops in our communities. Design thinking is a creative process for approaching any problem. It starts with getting to know the user and moves through steps for defining the ""user need"" and challenge, brainstorming solutions, building prototype, and trying them out! THE WORKSHOPAdapted from our partners at Girl Possible, the two-hour-long ""Find Your Drive"" workshops each cater to 15-20 students from middle school or high school between the ages 13-18. Using the design thinking mindset, the workshop enables youth to uncover their unique leadership styles, discuss the issues that matter most to them, and reframe them as opportunities to make a change - all while laughing, playing, and bonding. Why do we need your support & What are you funding?What do you get in return for your contribution?This project is deeply personal, emotional and meaningful to us. By supporting one student's  dream and creating impact through our work, you too become a part of our journey. We believe this is not just about ourselves, or the youth we reach directly, the schools, or even yourself, our generous donor. This is bigger than all of us! It is about bringing positivity and hope for the future to young people in Japan and inspiring the next generation of changemakers. During our trip we will provide regular updates on the progress through our Instagram posts as well as on the Video Blog we will set up specifically for this purpose. We will also provide a final report at the end of our project. Partners and SupportersTestimonialsRISE TEAM:AHHYUN ROH is a candidate for a bachelor of sociology and anthropology at Sophia University and her passion is to build a better education system, especially for the youth.

<p>One day a fellow stock trader in an online forum asked Max to mentor him. This request turned on a light bulb in Max's head as he realized he could combine his two passions: trading and education.</p>
<p>Over the course of five years, Max developed a unique education model that perfectly combines one-on-one mentorship with easily distributable educational content.</p>
<p><strong>As Max honed in on his own skill as a mentor and raised numerous students from the ground up to become consistently profitable traders,</strong> he also worked every day to perfect an education model of teaching students then providing a job for students once they master the educational material.</p>

<p>One feature we plan to add to the Inlight App is <i>Trade Tracking</i>. This feature will allow users to safely and securely connect their brokerage accounts to automatically pull trade data into the Inlight App (manual entry can also be an option) and create an easy-to-read <i>trade card</i> (see below) you can share on social media, send to friends, or share with a trained Inlight mentor for personal trade analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Our goal</strong> is for the app to automatically track students' trades and help categorize them to make it super easy for mentors to provide quality education on each and every single trade taken.</p>
<p><i>If we reach our stretch goals</i>, the app could also have an implemented AI that helps students find patterns in their trading to maximize profits and minimize losses.</p>

Because the Building Blocks are tangible and arranged on a surface for the children to see, it is easier for them to spot the mistake in their code and debug the program.</p><p><strong><span>Function:</span></strong> A function is a part of code that can be called by another part of the program. With Cody, kids can create a function and record it with Cody. Cody will remember that function and perform it again in the code every time he encounters a “Play Function” Block.</p><p><strong><span>Logic:</span></strong> Learning the thinking behind coding teaches children how to tackle large problems by breaking them down into a sequence of smaller, more manageable problems. This logical thinking skill is a powerful tool that can be used in every field and in real life too! </p><p> </p><div data-id=""28487412""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1588755791/ayvoz54iay6uprjjarnd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

 Hi! We are QUBS, a Swiss company, and we’re launching our first educational toy: Cody Block! Cody Block is a Montessori inspired, screen-free wooden toy for children 3+, introducing the basics of computational thinking through tangible programming. It’s a busy city! Go on adventures with Cody, help him find his way home by driving through the cityscape one block at a time! Create and learn the basics of coding, it’s hands on programming! 
 
 Cody Block introduces the first concepts of computational thinking to young children via tangible programming. Your task is to lay out a path that leads Cody back to his house by positioning the Building Blocks in a correct order.   
Turn left, turn right, U turn, repeat last command, stop, record path, play pathEach Building Block gives a unique directional command (turn left, turn right, U turn, repeat last command, stop, record path, play path), together they create a sequence of instructions (the basis of any algorithm).   Cody Block comes with the City Guide, a story book with several exercises & adventures providing different learning outcomes.   
 
  A classic wooden toy combined with patented RFID technology. Children can play with Cody for hours without the need of any smartphone, laptop or screen. We have developed a specific RFID technology (patented!) that is embedded in every wooden block.    
 
 Cody Block has been designed with gender equity in mind, it is as much fun for boys as for girls. Also, there are no written information on the toy, it’s ready to play even if your child does not read.  

 
 The design of Cody Block takes its inspiration from classic wooden toys and the Montessori philosophy in its material and shape: solid beech wood and intuitive design. We intentionally did not incorporate light or sound, and there are no visible electronics. Just a moving car driving around the city blocks.  
 
 
  Your city can be as big as you want, the Building Blocks can be set 20  cm, 50 cm, 1 meter, 10 meters apart! It’s all up to you and your imagination! And there are no limits to how many blocks and Cody car you can play with!  
 
  
 
  In this digital age it is important to empower children to be creators and not only passive users of new technologies. The current generation of children will need to be literate in technology in order to understand the world they live in.   Understanding how computers work and learning the basics of coding will not only help children to learn logical thinking but also to develop fundamental problem solving abilities, creativity and resilience. Learning these skills from an early stage creates a natural tendency to assimilate this content in a more efficient way.  
 
 Cody helps introducing coding concepts to the little ones. But what will they learn? And how?Algorithm: An algorithm is a set of rules that define a sequence of operations. When children lay out the Building Blocks for Cody to follow, they are actually giving the computer rules on how and where to move.Sequencing: Sequencing is the specific order in which instructions are performed in an algorithm. It is important that the steps in an algorithm are performed in the correct order - otherwise the algorithm will not work. In the same way Cody follows the order of the Building Blocks: if one Block is misplaced or there’s a gap in the sequence, Cody will go in the wrong direction.Debugging: Mistakes in code are called ‘bugs.’ Debugging is a process that includes identifying the problem and then correcting it. Because the Building Blocks are tangible and arranged on a surface for the children to see, it is easier for them to spot the mistake in their code and debug the program.Function: A function is a part of code that can be called by another part of the program. With Cody, kids can create a function and record it with Cody. Cody will remember that function and perform it again in the code every time he encounters a “Play Function” Block.Logic: Learning the thinking behind coding teaches children how to tackle large problems by breaking them down into a sequence of smaller, more manageable problems. This logical thinking skill is a powerful tool that can be used in every field and in real life too!  
 We chose to create a tangible programming language that kids can actually touch with their hands, following the Montessori proposition that kids learn best by experiencing the environment around them.   
 
  
 
 The Cody Block set comes with: 
 1 Cody (the little car) with magnetic top and bottom
 16 Building Blocks (4 x turn left, 4 x turn right, 2 x U turn, 1 x repeat, 2 x record, 2 x play, 1 x stop)
 1 City Guide / story book with exercises  

 Cody always drives in a straight line and only changes direction or stops when it faces a Building. You can’t drive without a driver, so to turn Cody ON, simply snap his head and body together (we are using magnets!).  
 
 
 There are 7 different Buidling Blocks, each gives a specific order to Cody. Each Cody Block set comes with 16 Building Blocks in total.
Blue building > turn LEFT X4 
Yellow building > turn RIGHT X4 
Green building > U turn X2 
Orange building > REPEAT last command X1 
Red building > RECORD a path X2 
Grey building > PLAY a path X2 
Red little house > STOP X1  
 
 Here is an interview from Bruce Lamont, a primary school teacher and a Lead Teacher in Zurich with 32 years of experience:    
 
  You might wonder how Cody detects the instruction commands from the blocks. We are not using any camera recognition. Instead we are using a piece of technology called RFID (Radio-Frequency-Identification). In short, it consists of an antenna (inside Cody) emitting an electromagnetic field in order to detect a tag (inside the blocks) with a unique identification. RFID is commonly used in the industry (contactless payment, door pass, etc.) but it was a challenge to develop that technology to meet Cody Block requirements. We are very proud to say that our use of RFID technology in Cody Block is patented! And don’t worry, the radio frequency we are using is of course safe for your children.   The other advantage with RFID technology is that it means Cody only needs batteries to power up (4 x AA batteries). It works straight out of the box. No Bluetooth, no Wifi required. The Building Blocks are literally just a wooden block with a little tag embedded in it.  
 
 
 
 Cody Block has been designed by Studio Oscar Lhermitte, a multidisciplinary design studio based in Paris & London. The studio developed the product with these factors in mind: being playful, intuitive while at the same time being a beautiful little wooden toy with a life of its own. All the illustration work was created by the talented illustrator, João Fazenda. We hope you love it as much as we do! As well as thinking hard about the way Cody Block looks and feels, we’ve spent a huge amount of time on the engineering side of it. The mechanics, electronics & software development were engineered by Studio Christophe Machet and Studio Peter Krige, respectively.

Several of our partners/collaborators have had extensive experience with Kickstarter and they all told us it was clear to them that Cody Block should be launched on Kickstarter.We have our manufacturer secured and have pricing agreement with them. They have been behind several successful products that were launched on Kickstarter and they have done extensive work on toys in general. The funds raised on Kickstarter will go towards:
Manufacturing (tooling, components, assembly, …)
Development of Design For Manufacture (working hand in hand with the factory and for production optimization)
Certifications
Testings
Storage & Shipping 
 
 We are aware of the complexity of manufacturing a product and delivering it to the backers. We are confident we have built the right team with the best expertise. The timeline below shows the milestones from now until completion. 
 
 Thank you so much for reading this far! ;-) We could not be here and have done such work without the contribution of fantastic people, so special thanks to: Rolv-Erik Spilling, Tim Schindel, Bernd Gottwald, Bruce Lamont, Oscar Lhermitte, Federica Orlati, Peter Krige, Christophe Machet, Joao Fazenda, Sophie Demay, Maël Fournier - Comte, Arthur Lhermitte, Elisa Bertron, the whole team at Sidekick Creatives, Solange & Arnaud, Margaux & Hadrien, Marine & Matt, Amandine & Aïssa, Rokhia and Ytaly.",51.0,1,"1 Campaign

Everyone is compensated for their involvement
The education is supported by a community
Teaching can morph as quickly as student needs change 
The subject matter can help students learn more about themselves and what matters to them.

 

What We Need & What You Get
What DigiMyths Needs
As with all campaigns here on IndieGogo, we need funding to make this program a reality. Most of the money the we’re raising will go towards compensating those involved during the program (participants, Babycastles, the instructor) and materials after the program concludes, including an organized public speaker series and publication of a book comprised of participants’ work.

Break Down


Participants Compensation ($500 / 10 participants)
Participants will deposit $20 to secure their spot in the program and receive the deposit plus an additional $50 dollars upon program completion.


Speakers Compensation ($150 / 2 speakers)The instructor Kevin Cadena will invite artists whose work aligns with this program to speak as part of a public speaker series.


Babycastles Compensation ($150)This will go towards helping fund the second year of their residency and any operational costs.


Instructor Compensation ($100)This piece will go towards compensating the instructor for the work of planning the program. 


Documentation Books ($202 / 50 books) We will print books as mementos for the participants, for documentation, for IndieGogo supporters and the rest to be sold.


Total: $1,102
 Where do the funds go if we don’t reach the entire goal?
Depending on what is made, the priority of the funds distribution will be:

Participants Compensation

The biggest challenges for this program involve the funding & promotion of the program.


Applicant Pool SizeWhile the first iteration of DigiMyths will only have 10 participants, promoting this program so that there is a good ratio of applications to accepted students is important. This will allow for greater change at a larger range of perspectives in the initial cohort and is related to the next challenge. 


Range of Participant PerspectivesWith this program, we also want to make sure that the opportunity is accessible and safe to all people and that specifically those whose identities intersect with BIPOC, LGBTQIA, and disabilities. 


Compensation of ParticipantsAs stated in the “What We Need Section”, compensation of the participants is the most important part of this campaign. 



 

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can’t donate right now, thank you for still being here and know that there are other ways to help! 
You can:  

Help DigiMyths have a range of perspectives. Know any college-age students who would be interested in this? Send them the microsite: http://digimyths.online/ and encourage them to apply. 

Help spread the word about this campaign! Know anyone who would be interested in helping this program happen? Send it their way. Every dollar helps towards compensating our participants and realizing the full vision of this program.

<h3>How You Can Help &amp; What You Get!</h3>
<p>We need to raise 20K to accomplish our final three phases and launch Camp Shark Smarts.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>PHASE 1</strong> is finishing the build out of the program so that every video, visual and action step is completed and ready for launch. We’re in need of the resources to cover the cost of these remaining media elements so we can start helping creatives connect their craft with customers.</li>
<li>
<strong>PHASE 2</strong> is to produce a series of free youtube videos where we sit down with successful creatives who reveal how they made it through each of the laps we talk about in the program. Part of the funds will go towards the production of these free youtube videos so Camp Shark Smarts will be available to everyone regardless of what their life situation is.</li>
<li>
<strong>PHASE 3</strong> is marketing Camp Shark Smarts once it’s completed. If the right people don’t know Camp Shark Smarts exists, it won’t matter that we’ve made it. So the remainder of the funds will make sure Camp Shark Smarts reaches the people it can help the most.</li>

<p>Next is a composite video that was presented to the United States Patent and Trade Office on 9-16-2019 for Chapters 1-12. See the link below for the composite model runs. The first 2 chapter are base line runs, without energized gyro flywheels showing no motion. Chapters 3 &amp; 5 are hobby craft model runs uphill in a garage. The chapter 4 run is a mishap with a hobby cart unit with narrow wheelbase, showing that a wider wheelbase is required for framing stability. It also shows the external forces at play. The next 2 runs, chapter 6 &amp; 7, show a machine shop “strong model” on a level surface. The next 5 runs (Chapter 8-12) show this model going up ramps at 1.7% and 0.8% grade. Chapters 8 &amp; 9 climb the 1.7% ramp. Chapter 10-12 utilized the 0.8% ramp. These videos were required to overcome the patent examiner’s comments.</p>

This deserves everyone's full attention. Don't be apathetic for new mobility for mountains, sky, snow and ice travel. Want Great Mobility, then support this, stop<strong> long delays</strong>. Want progress? <strong>Hovering</strong> even for the <strong>handicapped </strong>with speed, power and safety. Want absolute Maneuverability? No propellers, no jets, no cables. Total access to cliffs or mountain peaks. Stop overturning for tall vehicles on sharp turns.<strong> Fuel efficient and Powerful. </strong>Yes this is blunt, but needed, since nothing else is working. If you want the <strong>extremely good mobility benefits for mankind,</strong> then support this in some manner. Sharing and posting would help. For the greater good go beyond small mindedness. Pinch yourself, wake up, shame on you. Do your research on us and the project first, then support us, so you can be proud of what you have supported. Remember the - <strong>""Pay it forward""</strong> movement. Do something good for this noble and beneficial project. Remember <strong>Karma</strong>, it will come back to you. Help us build this, all help is appreciated and will be remembered, recorded, and rewarded at some point. Only personal engineering friends have contributed time, effort, and funding. Come join us. </p><p>C.W. Musser-""The question is not if one can- but if one cares to spend the time &amp; effort"" - <strong>WE CAN FULLY DEVELOP THIS WITH GOOD SUPPORT. </strong></p><p>Do you want <strong>complete mobility</strong>? Then this can be the real answer when perfected. Join us, and help to see it done in short order without further delays. Funding and good support is needed. We know now that it has a <strong>VERY GREAT FUTURE,</strong> since we have a great new beginning. We just had recent good and verifiable results due to diligence and thorough <strong>proof testing</strong>. We have spent the necessary time and effort. Before now, no one has seen such complete mobility, except in our vision of this project. It is now straight forward and obvious, due to the <strong>great results</strong> we are seeing now. Even<strong> Walt Disney</strong> would be impressed. All his imagined crafts could be possible in the near future. Remember Epcot Theme Park in Florida.  But let us start together with this <strong>simple toy</strong> first.</p><p>Why spend all your time at Dave &amp; Buster's, or playing endless video games, when you could be enjoying something even more rewarding, possibly making history and expanding a fantastic new technology? Amaze your friends and families, with your very own one-of-kind Gyro Reaction Drive. Come join us for the ride of your life. We are Declaring <strong>WAR on video games</strong> - Endless &amp; Time Consuming.</p><p>You can <strong>pioneer real toy units</strong> that are capable of setting and <strong>breaking world records</strong>. You can do all of this because I own the exclusive utility patent (pending) and for a limited time I’m offering licenses to build <strong>individualized</strong> versions of the unit that run great. I have recorded several finished model runs on video.</p><p>You can also experiment with your own configuration, and prove your own discoveries of the principles for improving performance and making the unit more dependable and useful. And so <strong>your name could be put into the record books,</strong> and you can master this new science by hands-on building and construction. This is all possible because we have indeed broken the major ground for this unit. We are allowing several options, and you may select one and work at your own pace, as you learn much more about it. Then it will be easier to change the unit components for <strong>your own improvements </strong>and record your own evidence in <strong>videos </strong>for posting on sites like YouTube. <strong>Make a little history,</strong> like the Wright Brothers!</p><p>Start building <strong>your own toy unit for garage experiments. </strong>We will be glad to help you along the way. There will be a lot of fun in these discoveries, and very rewarding. </p><p>The kits now include strong motors that can run without over heating. Flywheel construction is now also perfected. Flywheels are now center drilled, symmetrical and balanced. </p><p>Come join us for the ride of your life, and why not do it Today? This is very good work and pleasure, since it is very satisfying working with your hands either in a<strong> family or hobby group</strong> or individually. </p><h3>Add Color to your Model &amp; Video - Go Wild - Be creative &amp; aggressive:</h3><p>Design you own themes for your models. My thoughts is for an original early steam train engine or an older farm tractors theme. Your theme colors can get much attention by posting your model on U-Tube. </p><h3>The Future &amp; Real Solutions for Fuel Consumption &amp; Infrastructure - Help us by promoting this.</h3><p>This is a <strong>GAME CHANGER -Totally Disruptive</strong>.  Absolutely - YES says me and all my engineering friends, We are mostly professional mechanical engineers and we say it is very powerful and it will become extremely beneficial and is indeed a World Class Game Changer in Technology. We strongly believe it will be totally disruptive to <strong>all power driven crafts.</strong> This will happen, but we are hoping for <strong>it's full potential to be funded &amp; supported now. </strong>The timing depends on you. Are you interested in game changer<strong> fuel efficiency</strong> and <strong>numerous</strong> new applications? It inherently offers <strong>customized</strong> machines for <strong>unlimited utility. </strong></p><p><strong>WE ARE ASKING FOR POLITICAL AND SOCIAL MEDIA HELP.</strong> Remember the movie Back to the Future. ""Roads, Where we are going we don't need Roads.""  This is possible. We think we have the real answers. This project will provide the economical and practical aerial engineering solutions that are needed. Help us any way possible. Please Blog, share, post, and<strong> help us promote </strong>this. No help yet from any formal source. No funding proposals have been approved. But more publicity will help. When we get millions of hits on our  U Tube video's posted here,  it will automatically bring in the needed attention and funding that this project deserves. In addition to real and very good fuel relief, it could also solve much of the infrastructure issues by going aerial. Help us promote this for a future that includes much more<strong> freedom and safety</strong>. Perhaps the USA Space Army and Infrastructure folks will see this and come on board.</p><h3>Potential Usage is Very Impressive &amp; Walt Disney crafts are Next: </h3><p>Think of the aerial fuel saving possible. Think of the ice travel and vehicle braking capacity and overturning protection for tall trains, or vehicles. That is, vehicle braking without traction needed. Think of lifts, pull carts. Think of underwater crafts. It has very impressive potential with new capacities and/or capabilities. Think of a world <strong>without dangerous propellers. </strong>Think of hovering wheel chair for the handicapped. Think of many other hovering craft. Remember for this craft, wheels are only needed for a stable platform; therefore, all terrain vehicles are a natural. How far can we go with this is beyond my personal imagination at this point. Or we can just take off from the original Walt Disney Cartoons. </p><h3>Design Theme - Modern or Old School - Many Choices</h3><p>Also apply <strong>your own colorful design </strong>for attention getting photo appearances. My thoughts are for an older steam engine presentation or theme. Also video the gyro machine unit could pull a cart for your <strong>pet to ride in.</strong> It would be great video's to show to the family and friends.</p><h3>Challenge to all Technical Colleges:  </h3><p>Beat this model (Ga. Tech. Alumni &amp; Inventor W.E. Wood) by speed, slope and power and make Historical Records and make smoother forward runs for improvements. Plan your experiments for historical records. </p><h3>Go all Terrain for Land or Water- Challenges:</h3><p>Revise and make all terrain vehicle without tracks, only free wheeling support needed, Reconfigure for smooth forward runs on any surface or water. Build you own new stabilizer frames for water, and mount motor/flywheels for optimum performance. Video and make historical runs. Any runs with unique shapes and sizes will be <strong>new historical records </strong>accredited to the model builder, since totally unique configurations are easy to verify with dimensions and data.

Application submitted long prior to 2020, it has a patent pending status at the United States Patent and Trade Office, by Walter E. Wood, residing in Sylvester Georgia, USA. Applications of this multiple purpose innovation, if fully developed, could become vast and wide ranging. This new form of drive may be superior to many other historical innovations as a Prime Mover. It may even be on the order of the Wright Brothers discovery for powered flight, by means of lift. The new US Space Force would do well to explore and develop this technology. Many earlier attempts to demonstrate these new gyro motion principles were unsuccessful, due to incomplete understanding, in order to achieve the desired directional force.</p><p>The unit expands the current science to include a continual reaction force due to the new design configuration of the mechanism. This new reaction force can be readily harnessed and become remarkably useful. It can produce<strong> forward motion</strong> for crafts or vehicles. It produces a force that is useful for other proposes as well. It has many utilities, and is very versatile, since only a stable frame is required. Ground unit applications will have one main gear-motor driver reaction force, applied through the framing onto a ground surface. For aerial crafts a tail rotor, very similar to helicopters, would resist a turning moment. This effectively establishes a stable frame, as well. By maintaining stability of the unit’s framing,<strong> aerial flight</strong> capacity can be achieved in principle. Two types of models have extensively proven typical ground travel with good forward motion with force. This was proven by<strong> uphill</strong> and <strong>up ramp</strong> testing for several models, with various configurations, including small and large size models. The models produce a forward motion that is consistent during extensive testing. Many parameter variations are available for adjustments. All testing was conducted and certified by professional engineers. Several engineers have completed affidavits for direct physical witness of different unit test runs. Some were made by video observations presented by the inventor. Other expert witnesses provided written affidavits as well, such as a machine shop owner.</p><p>The USA patent office (USPTO) has been slow to recognize the actual application of the existing rotational science, therefore a continuing submittal process is ongoing, but will inevitably be accomplished with full patent approval. Spectacular runs are forthcoming. Testing has been video recorded over several years. Exact time frames are confidential due to patent laws for qualified older applications. The Provisional Patent Application was submitted 5/2/2012, and a full Utility 5/2/2013. The Utility Patent number is 13,886,257.</p><h3>Background and History of Prior Developments</h3><p>Much of what is known about rotating dynamics of moving bodies, comes from a 17th century scientist, Leonhard Euler, soon after the related law of motion by Sir Isaac Newton.</p><p>Today’s technology includes many related applications for gyroscopes (flywheels). Larger gyroscopic stabilizer units are used in Navy Vessels, to minimize the effects of ocean waves. Their reaction forces minimize the normal rotation of the ship. A much better vertical position is maintained preventing the ship from being tilted over.</p><p>Many people are familiar with present day camera platform gyro stabilizers, These are smaller but react in the same manner for position stability.</p><p>This new gyro motion machine is unique and is well beyond current technologies. It has never been utilized for propulsion or <strong>forward motion</strong> in any manner. It should be emphasized that this is only one step above existing present day gyro stabilizer capacity and function. But it has been previously ignored or misunderstood. Certainly it has not been developed. The simple expansion for this new development has escaped discovery, hiding in plain sight. In short, it is a simple step forward from existing established and proven gyro technologies. But this gyro craft provides <strong>continual and sustained forces,</strong> rather than <strong>temporary reactions.</strong> Power is likewise supplied continually and is sustained.</p><p>Many on-line videos are available that show precession. Several You Tube videos show a rotating bicycle wheel for a typical demonstration. One could ignore this and say it is not a large powerful reaction. But the fact is that they do show a steady rotation or precession after an initial disturbance. Therefore, this shows a reaction torque clearly. And it also has an associated reaction force being shown. Therefore, it can be utilized as a force. But it is a temporary reaction, which results in a steady rotational motion with an angular velocity. The reaction is clearly visible. Therefore, these demonstrations show the reaction as a practical and useful principle. <strong>Making the reaction continual and sustained is possible, </strong>if properly configured <strong>within a new gyro motion machine.</strong> This will be discussed below in detail.</p><h3>Explanation &amp; Analysis</h3><p>There are well known existing commercial gyroscopic applications. Many of which are currently utilized for stability and for guidance. Basically, a flywheel in rotation becomes gyroscopic in nature with a number of fundamental characteristics. One of the main characteristics is the “rigidity in space” nature, which is simply <strong>a resistance to any motion.</strong> It is better known as rotational inertia and is indeed a re-labeling of the same characteristic. When there is force applied to the axis of the flywheel there is a reaction force created. A temporary one is well known, and has several existing commercial applications for stability. Some examples of this include race cars, large ships, and camera platforms. A reset to the starting position is required for these existing stabilizer gyro units. This new gyro machine keeps the reaction force going by continually moving the gyroscopic rotating flywheel. It seems simple and could easily have been done much earlier in history. However, this is now a very current application for development. It is currently under much experimentation by the inventor. It includes many noted improvements for construction, but the principals are the same. There are some design parameters being adjusted for some better optimization, but the main principles remain.</p><p>The reaction forces are continual due the design. See the sketch below for the conceptual design for the ground craft. The first machine being explained is the cart unit. Once the principal is understood for this unit the other units will be similar and more forthcoming.</p><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gyro_Cart_Isometric.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gyro_Cart_Is...</a> </p><p><strong>Gyroscopic Ground Craft Isometric Diagram ​</strong></p><p>The figure above shows the component parts. The electrical delivery system is not shown. For convenience, see the list below for the major parts.</p><p>The major parts list for the Figure 1 is this; 1 gyro motor, 2 gyro flywheel, 5 shaft, 6 bearings, 8 core assembly wheel, 9 drive gear-motor, 10 &amp; 11 pulleys or sheaves, 12 belt, 13 wheels, 21 framing, 31 flywheel rim weights.</p><p>See the sketch below for part 1 of 2 of the external  force analysis - for gravity and the associated wheel reactions. The concepts were recently presented to the United States Patent and Trade Office, that show the force analysis for stability. For the technical astute it should be clear that a <strong>simple stability </strong>for the craft is all that is needed, for the reaction force to be harnessed for a good forward motion.</p><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gyro_Analysis_Cart.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gyro_Analysi...</a> </p><p><strong>Analysis of Gravity &amp; Reactions for Gyro Craft ​</strong></p><p>The components include the core assembly wheel, gyro motors and flywheels, drive gear-motor, support framing, electrical brushes, bushings, wiring, bearings, shaft, pulleys, belt, hubs, switches, converters or power supply, and coaster wheels. Their sizing and configuration becomes the design parameters.</p><p>Current models include 3 hobby crafts and a larger machine shop model. Current model runs are posted on YouTube. All have produced good forward motion. Craft weight range from 60 lb to 230 lb. A composite video, assembled with Pinnacle Studio, was presented to the United States Patent and Trade Office on 9-16-2019 for Chapters 1-12. See the link below for the model runs. The first 2 chapters are base line runs, without energized gyro flywheels demonstrating no motion without sustained gyro flywheel counter revolutions. Chapters 3 &amp; 5 are hobby craft model runs uphill in a garage. The chapter 4 run is a mishap with a hobby cart unit with a narrow wheelbase or<strong> track</strong>, showing that a wider wheelbase is required for framing stability. It also shows the external forces at play. T<span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">he next 2 runs, chapter 6 &amp; 7, show a machine shop “strong model” on a level surface. The next 5 runs (Chapter 8-12) show this model going up ramps at 1.7% and 0.8% grade. Chapters 8 &amp; 9 climb the 1.7% ramp. Chapter 10-12 utilized the 0.8% ramp. These videos were required to overcome the patent examiner’s critical comments and assertions.</span></p><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BfpJX_qOdI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BfpJX_qOdI</a> </p><p>To correct existing misleading notions and preconceived ideas for this simple machine, an expounded explanation for external reaction forces is appropriate. Included is a simple force to moment conversion diagram, illustrated below to save much discussion. It should be self-explanatory. The diagram is presented to show that the large reactionary moment of the gear-motor is actually converted to vertical forces. Then these forces are applied to the concrete floor surface through the cartwheels. It could even be said that the moment is being transformed and then transmitted. The cart ground unit resists overturning by reactions of the floor surface upon the unit’s wheels. The unit’s weight and the wheelbase work together. The induced external forces resist for two types of reactions in a simple manner. The cart remains stable for both its natural weight and for the induced moment of the unit’s drive gear-motor. Both types of external forces should be classified as ground reaction forces. This is expounded in a PE Certified Analysis for both the ground units and the aerial units. The major point is that both the frames of the ground units and aerial units are <strong>stable and allow</strong> the gyro machine to function.</p><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:4_Force_to_Moment.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:4_Force_to_M...</a> </p><p><strong>Force to Moment Conversion Diagram</strong></p><p>For a simple ground craft argument, an essential requirement is the framing stability. It is often overlooked. This requires both a substantial wheelbase and gravity of the unit working together to resist a substantial overturning moment. This allows the other systems in play to react with a forward force. The other systems include the gyroscopic<strong> reaction forces for forward motion.</strong></p><p>There is no <strong>push against </strong>a surface, but rather there is a significant and substantial moment conversion to a downward vertical force. This is not a linear push against type <strong>action. </strong>Linear reaction type analysis and <strong>equal opposite linear thinking </strong>is not appropriate in rotational dynamics. Linear dynamics and analysis is simpler and more commonly understood.</p><p>See the sketch below for part 2 of the external force analysis. It clearly shows the Gear-Motor moment  and associated reactions, which allows for the cart stability, and thus allows the gyro mechanism to function successfully. Clearly the wheel base is a factor to prevent overturning.</p><p>PlaceHolder</p><p><strong>Analysis of External Reaction Forces for Gear Motor Moment</strong></p><p>At this point, the major effort has not been to perfect the equations, but rather perfecting the craft models for proof. An extensive discovery of the sizing and design parameters is ongoing. It is notable that the governing equation is multidimensional  (vector based). While a simplifiFed statement for the resultant equation, in a practical manner, is limited (magnitude based). Even so the concept is relatively simple, <strong>once the visual demonstrations are observed.</strong>  It is progressive in model design and performance. All runs were conducted, documented, and videoed by a Licensed Professional Engineer, the inventor. Documents are PE certified for all submitted runs.</p><p>Improved ramps for hobby craft are expected soon. Thus far the uphill for the hobby craft has been modest up slope of a typical garage floor. However, there are up ramp runs accomplished and documented for the machine shop model. The maximum up ramp grade of 1.7 % for these runs is approaching the normal maximum Rail Road grades of 2 %. These are seen in the above video’s. The video’s and data records are professional engineer certified by the inventor and a third party professional engineer. Both PE’s have completed a certification on the engineering principle analysis and a certification. The documents included a record  and witness of several model runs. Copies can be made available, upon request.</p><p>The pending patent is very descriptive and is available on-line by searching Walter E. Wood, and the patent “Gyroscopic Motion Machine”.  There is no competition, since these are all unique designs for hobby craft sales and promotions. </p><p>Depending on others is not now required, due to expected more impressive model runs. These can be posted on the internet or on the crowd funding sites. Also there are new research publication options. Many improvements were made and now the performance is at much higher levels. The previous hobby models were assembled with homemade components. Vibrations from initial methods have been substantially reduced. Many other areas of construction and assembly have become more professional as well. The designs allow for electrical delivery to accommodate the available hobby size dc motors. The patent descriptions and drawing are exact in principles and remain the same as per the original design. Only patent claim revisions were necessary to be totally inclusive, which was accomplished by a previous amendment. However, the analysis and explanation has been greatly expounded in great detail for the Request for Continued Examination to the United States Patent &amp; Trade Office. (This is essentially a re-submittal of the Utility Patent Application for re-examination with the new supporting material.)  The evidence for approval should be adequate and approval is expected for the next review. (RCE was recently submitted by mail and received on 9/18/2019 by the United States Patent and Trade Office with postal receipts.)</p><p>Perhaps, this article will initiate more academic support. The Georgia Center of Innovation, which is part of the Georgia Economic Development, has been supportive. Perhaps with more professional hobby craft model runs, it will be recognized for its potential merits more fully. Perhaps it has not been promoted well. <strong>More impressive runs</strong> for the hobby crafts should be forthcoming soon, under independent development. A major new hobby craft model has now been successful for some initial start up testing. New configurations for several different size hobby craft models are currently being developed at the same time.</p><p>Technical and popular magazines are being evaluated to publish an opinion editorial. Other sponsorship avenues and some innovative contest are being evaluated. Even TV and other publication are being investigated for publicity assistance. Certainly, several crowd funding web site should be posted soon. Other social media postings are ongoing as well. Please offer suggestions if  something comes to mind.</p><h3>Physics and Math Details for a Predictive Theory</h3><p>These are the precepts, and one existing equation that will be developed, as more is understood of the resulting magnitude of the reaction force.</p><p><strong>“Standard Handbook for Mechanical Engineers” </strong>by Marks, 7th edition by Theodore Baumeister, McGraw Hill 1967, is copied in sections and inserted below to explain the older existing gyro stability technology. This equation will be useful as a starting point for later studies and developments. Gyroscopic forces are briefly illustrated in Fig. 73 on page 3-32 of the Handbook, which is copied here for reference.</p><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Marks_Gyro_Reaction_Diagram.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Marks_Gyro_R...</a> </p><p><strong>Mark's Mechanical Engineering Handbook - Gyro Reaction Forces</strong></p><p>Taken from Mark’s - ""Let k = the radius of gyration of the wheel about it's axis. (If all the weight is at the rim, k2 =R2 ;"", or more simply k=R, where R is the radius of the rim weight.</p><p>The reference diagram to the left is being utilized by the design of the flywheels with the concentrated weight on the outer part of the wheels. Only a few physical restrictions would limit the design, and the outer weight principle is being maximized, and captured by the design. This is commonly referred as “rim loading”.</p><p>Taken from Mark’s - ""Now suppose that the axle end A is constrained to move between two smooth fixed guides, forming a slot;” ……. “then the mere motion of A along the slot will call into play a strong lateral pressure P (called a gyroscopic reaction) against one of the guides.”</p><p>This lateral pressure “P” is indeed the resultant force being utilized for this new machine. All of the other aspects of the new machine can be optimized to maximize “P” above, that is continuous due to the unique design.</p><p>Taken from Mark’s - “The magnitude of the gyroscopic force “P” at any instant is proportional to the spinning velocity, and also to the velocity of A along the slots, having given by</p><p>Pb=(w/g)(k2)(π N/30)(v/b)”</p><p>Providing more explanation, changing it slightly for clarity to read,</p><p>(P x b) = Moment = Force x Moment Arm = (w/g)(k2) ((π =3.14159)(N/30)(v/b)</p><p>Taken from Mark’s - “where Pb = moment of P about the center, v = the linear velocity of the point A along the slot at the instant in question, N = rpm in the spinning velocity of the wheel, and g = 32.17 ft per sec.”  Note that “P” is the “gyroscopic reaction” force with a “strong lateral pressure ""P ”. The letter “w” is the weight of the disk flywheel in lbs.</p><p>Also taken from Mark’s – “It should be noted that the gyroscopic reaction P against the fixed guide does not depend on the magnitude of the accelerating force Q, except in so far as Q is necessary to create the velocity  v,”</p><p>It is <strong>well established </strong>that for gyroscopic devices including spinning flywheels, that when imposing a force “Q” at the end of its axle, a <strong>useable reaction</strong> always tends to move at<strong> right angles (normal) </strong>to the<strong> imposed force “Q”,</strong> as shown in this case. Accordingly, it will react with a force “P” when restrained at the same end in the respective direction.</p><p>The illustration above illustrates an axle end “A”  that is constrained to move between the fixed guides, forming a slot. If force  “Q”  is applied to pull the point  “A”  along the slot, while the wheel is turning, the motion of  “A”  will cause a<strong> strong lateral pressure “P”</strong> as shown in the diagram. “P” is the gyroscopic reaction because of a<strong> change in the angular momentum </strong>caused by the force “Q”. The direction of the force “P” depends upon the direction of the spin and “Q”. The respective angular momentum vector is not shown in this simple diagram. The force directions for “Q” and “P” are clearly shown and are adequate for understanding of the action and reaction principles. Understanding that gyroscopic reactions are not equal and opposite as per Newton for a 0 &amp; 180 configuration, but <strong>utilize the right hand rule </strong>per Euler and others to determine their direction, the application of this principle to the invention can be seen in the below diagram.</p><p>It does require some imagination to get from the above diagram to the below diagram, but the principle is the same. The gyro flywheel motor’s rigid mounting is where the unique generated lateral force is applied by the gyroscopic reaction. Likewise, the Q force is applied there also. The ""b"" distance above is difficult to transfer exactly to the new unit's configuration. (The innovation's configuration is the gyro motor mounting arrangements with the respective attached flywheel.) It is clear that ""b"" is a constant factor that will be determined empirically.</p><p>The new innovation’s configuration does not match the above Mark's diagram exactly; therefore more development of the above equation for this new gyro motion machine is required. The principle of the gyro reaction force does remain as a valid engineering forward resultant force, proven by the model runs to date. The above Mark's equation, however, can be a very good starting point. Therefore, the full equation development is a work in progress.</p><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:2_Gyro_with_core_rotation.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:2_Gyro_with_...</a> </p><p><strong>Core Wheel with 2 gyro flywheels - Reaction Force Diagram</strong></p><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Diagram_alternate_to_Marks_2_flywheels_%2B_motor.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Diagram_alte...</a></p><p><strong>Alternate with  Double Ended Motor </strong></p><p>The conservation of angular momentum is applicable to this unit. The rotation of the gyro flywheels are the energized components that allow energy to be released. Since this energy is available to be utilized, the conservation of angular momentum principle is not violated in any manner. The rotation of the flywheels is motorized, however, and therefore the RPM speed is maintained due to friction or other imperfections. As tests have shown when the unit core “assembly wheel” driver is energized during start up, the rotation of the all the gyro flywheels is disturbed and is affected. The energy is being transformed into forward motion, and the gyro flywheel motors are loaded. This is indicated by a change in speed of the energized flywheels. A slowdown is noticeable. Therefore the angular momentum is conserved, until the unit is started. Then some balancing occurs with a new reduced rpm speed of the gyro motors and respective flywheels. Then after stabilizing the gyro motors maintain their respective flywheel rpm speed. Thus the force forward is maintained for all the cart units presented, a certain forward speed is achieved. Thus all the submitted video’s are verified by Walter E. Wood, free from any doctoring, with all factors presented and fully disclosed in these documents. In fact, all the testing is verifiable and repeatable with the proper construction and assembly.</p><p>The Table shown below is taken and manually typed from the College Textbook Physics 101 Course “Physics Part I” by Robert Resnick and David Halliday, published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1966. This publication shows a comparison of scaler equations only and does not include the vector representation or directions. But there are <strong>great differences in the equations, </strong>and even more with the complete analysis including vector directional representation of all the functions or components, and are indeed <strong>two separate science categories.</strong> Therefore <strong>linear </strong>momentum equations and logic are too limited for the<strong> internal component analysis</strong> of this unit.</p><p>The linear equal opposite aspects for normal straight-line rectilinear motion or the normal linear scientific equations <strong>should not</strong> be applied to this unit for understanding the concept. All the physics publications use the equations of linear motion for<strong> comparison only </strong>and not for the actual application of <strong>rotational kinematics. </strong>See the Table below taken from a Physics 101 Course Textbook. Only when the unit has achieved a steady traveling speed, can these linear principles be applied to the unit as a whole. This is indeed a gyroscopic functioning new machine with good utility. For the cart unit to be stabilized, there is a <strong>moment balance </strong>needed but <strong>not </strong>in a linear fashion. The needed resisting moment is achieved through the cartwheels by the pavement. The <strong>external vertical forces </strong>of the pavement acting upon the cartwheels with a moment arm create the resisting moment. Thus the linear equal opposite action reaction principle does not apply for this gyroscopic motion machine. As shown above all forces react normal to, and the applied moment by the drive motor is achieved, balanced, and stabilized by <strong>external pavement vertical forces.</strong> Since these external force are entirely vertical it has no effect upon the horizontal motion of the cart.</p><p>As described in the specification of the pending  patent -“Gyroscopic Motion Machine“ A first gyro motor and flywheel turns counter-clockwise, and a second motor and flywheel turns clockwise, when viewed from the same vantage point, allowing the assembly wheel to create a <strong>reaction force,</strong> as it is rotated by a drive gear-motor.” The diagram above illustrates the reaction force or pressure created as a result of the change of angular velocity of the gyro flywheels and the applied force “Q” accomplished by the core “assembly wheel” rotation. Force “Q” is applied by the rotation of the assembly wheel, as the assembly wheel <strong>continuously</strong> applies force “Q” to the axle end of each flywheel, creating a continuous <strong>reaction force “P”</strong>. The normal force “Q” causes torque and a <strong>change in the angular momentum</strong> in the direction of that torque, which results in pressure or distributed force “P”, perpendicular to “Q”. Based on the principles governing the direction of that torque, the force of “P” will be same direction with reference to the flywheel axles when the flywheels are turning in opposite directions. <strong>(Looking in from the end of each flywheel.) </strong>Thus, there is a new force “P” that is generated by<strong> the conversion of force “Q” by the gyroscopic reaction,</strong> as shown in the above diagram. This conversion creates movement caused by force “P” via the gyroscopic motion machine described by the utility patent claims. Thus, the invention does not violate the principle of conservation of momentum, but rather obeys that principle as the force “P” induces an immediate reaction in a new direction, according to the<strong> right-hand rule in rotating bodies. </strong>Thus, the invention is demonstrated and proven to be operable according to known dynamics formulas and publications.</p><table border=""0"" cellpadding=""0""><tbody>

</tbody></table><h3>Future Potential Impact and Benefits of Technology</h3><p>Consider the existing propeller driven crafts, specifically air propeller systems. For example, an examination is required of typical airboat for its existing testing methods. The data reported by manufacturers' representatives of current and available commercial units shows an inefficient production of their output force. The testing method consists of a typical cattle weight scale positioned in line of a tie cable or chain, where the cable connects back to a tree on the shore with the boat floating in the water. The total power hp indication is not impressive. There is essentially no friction of the boat in the water. Therefore, it can be assumed that similar inefficient results take place for all propeller driven crafts. This implies that large hp engines are required that produce minimum force output. Force data is not yet available for the gyro crafts, but it is expected to be much better performance results than for air boats. All USA swamp fishermen know the inefficiencies of air boats, compared to normal water propeller boats or even special ""mud motor"" propeller driven boats.</p><p>The range of utility is vast for the new gyro motion machine. In general, this should replace all propeller driven crafts due to efficiency, not to mention safety. Other new applications are too numerous to list completely. <strong>But the major list includes horizontal crafts on any surface including ice. Also included are aerial crafts, marine crafts, braking for any craft on any surface, overturning protection for tall vehicles, lifts for inconvenient locations or conditions.</strong></p><p>With minimum rocket boosters to prevent a space ship rotation, it could be used for <strong>propulsion for space ships.</strong> The initial burst or burn is all that is needed since there is no friction in space and the ship’s forward velocity would be maintained with no depleting. </p><p>Remember the movie Back to the Future  – “Roads! Where we’re going, we won’t need roads!” We would ask you to consider the possibility of having hovering vehicles, hovering chairs, increased land speeds for tall vehicles, increased lift for all craft, compact and safe crafts for maneuvering on the side of cliff walls, safe tree work and inspections without booms. Please consider real braking capacity for ice travel. Not to mention a hovering craft for safe fire fighting work. There are extensive applications for this new innovation.</p><h3>Overcoming the Status Quo Bias</h3><p>These are some explanations to correct existing misleading notions and preconceived ideas for this simple machine.</p><p>First, the main principles for this gyroscopic motion machine require the use and understanding of rotational dynamics which was established by Leonhard Euler. Euler was Swiss and lived from 1707 to 1783. Euler’s work is well accepted as a classic era physicist for rotation. The specific reference for angular momentum is Euler's Laws of Motion. His work was 50 years later than Newton. Therefore in principle, this type rotational system is on an<strong> equal level </strong>with Newtonian physics. Rotational Physics is a <strong>separate science </strong>with different equations for motion. Newton encompasses Linear Laws of Motion and Euler encompasses Rotational Laws of Motion with the relevant equations. (Euler's Second Law is the accepted classical science for rotational physics.)</p><p>In addition, the most common mistake is Linear thinking for equal opposite reaction forces, since it is simple and more customary in normal mechanical systems. It is customary for tire traction systems for common vehicles. It consists of a common push against type action and reaction system.</p><p>Second is the free space evaluation. This is not applicable since the gyro motion machine works in a normal environment, with both gravity and normal atmospheric conditions. That is with gravity to assist in stability for ground units. And for aerial crafts, gravity is overcome but is still utilized for stability, but requires additional detailed force and moment analysis.</p><p>Last is the Reactionless drive nomenclature. This unit does not use propellants. The external forces and gyroscopic reaction forces are well explained in Professional Engineering certified analysis. First, the analysis for the ground craft unit is considered to assist understanding. The gyro cart has a force to moment conversion with vertical upward external force. Both this external reaction force and gravity of the craft work together for stability of the unit. The crafts wheelbase is also a factor for stability. This design does not have a horizontal push against a floor surface but rather an equivalent moment reaction by upward external reaction forces of the floor surface. Friction is not applicable, or any other misapplied factors for dismissing these model video runs. Only the pure gyro reaction forces are being utilized, which are well proven and repeatable. With a power supply, they are continual. <strong>Base line runs </strong>are included showing a well balanced core rotation with no energized flywheels. Therefore, the experimental methods have been professional.</p><h3>Unsuccessful Developments by Others</h3><p>To explain the lack of success by others previously, consider the following. No one has presented this exact design. For the current scientific communal posted analysis, the main problem, perhaps, is that no available units existed or were available for study. Maintaining secrecy due to prior patent laws may have hindered the sharing and posting of some inventors. Therefore, it is very easy to discredit an unknown and unproven science where no successful models exist.</p><p>Initially without any prior examples, there was some difficulty to construct good working models. There were no available resources for reference. For the best relevant history, Google search for two well renowned men who were pioneers in their day, the late Eric Laithwaite, formerly citizen of UK, and the late Francis J. McCabe, formerly of Mt. Airy, PA. These two men spent their later years attempting to bring a gyro craft to market, but were not successful. They both understood the power and associated benefits of gyroscopic reaction forces, and hoped to see it harnessed in some manner. McCabe published his gyro motion machine demonstration and test after the provisional patent was filed by Walter E. Wood, see below the link listed his web site. McCabe labeled it the Vehicle Gyro Oscillation Drive Model. His demonstration model was partially air and partial electric powered, but the principle are the same. McCabe utilized a single air powered flywheel in lieu of a pair of flywheels.</p><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kyzd3BaDm0&amp;feature=youtu.be"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kyzd3BaDm0&amp;amp...</a> </p><p>Again, no one has presented this exact design. Therefore, others with limited funds, and perhaps limited time were not able to make any commercial success by providing reasonable hobby toy models. The parts and materials are much simpler and this commercial barrier has been broken now. The parts have been standardized and economized. They include wheels, hubs and other manufactured components to perfect the unit, especially the gyro flywheels. Continuous improvements of construction techniques is ongoing and required for economics and performance. To prove the function and capacity, spectacular models with several configurations will be forthcoming and scheduled. The boundaries set by others has been breached. Others did not build successful running models for commercial consumption. These new designs, allow hobbyist to build good working models. In short, other innovators stopped or were stopped by circumstances. Therefore, the scientific community, as yet, has not fully considered the value of these gyro motion machines. All that is required is the power supply, a productive arrangement of gyros, a counter rotation to release the reaction, and a stable frame. This is also the first steps required to understand the science of this unit.</p><h3>Prior Publications &amp; The Need for Additional Development</h3><p>The gyro motion machine has been demonstrated in several on-line videos of models and at least one on-line study. The late scientist Fran McCabe, completed the one on-line study. However, it includes discussions about many associated experiments.</p><p>Francis J. McCabe's presented all of his experiments for gyro motion, including the failed experiments. This is very confusing. It is known now, that the real concern is the appropriate testing results of a practical design for his cart models and especially its proof video runs. Never the less, McCabe's report, with the associated experiments, is extremely useful for those who are familiar with the true gyroscopic principles.</p><p>Perhaps, McCabe was trying to express in his gyro motion study, that gyroscopic behavior occurs in nature more than generally realized. But it does not serve the study of this for simplifying and promoting a clear understanding. It extremely cluttered the material and became confusing. Therefore, it is not beneficial to add and support these far removed connections or relationships in nature. These things may be expounded at some later date.</p><p>At this time, the math developments leave room for revisions with several factors to apply for the existing equations. The computations for the resulting outputs will require (as a minimum) substantial empirical development for the relevant formulas.</p><h3>Prior Omissions or Expert Misconception's in Dynamic Theories &amp; Developments</h3><p>Several science reports from other sources have been previously accepted by a few in the science community that doubt gyro motion can be possible. The existing publications show a lack of willingness to build, experiment or to conduct open minded research. Below are specific arguments that have been raised. Each one is briefly discussed and put in their proper perspective.</p><p>Contra Argument No. 1 - Propeller propulsion is proven and gyro propulsion is not.</p><p>Rebuttal: Both of these have reaction force outputs. This is clearly visible with the new videoed and certified cart model runs of the gyro motion machine.</p><p>Contra Argument No. 2. Existing gyro stabilizers for ships are not relevant.</p><p>Rebuttal: These existing powerful systems produce large reaction forces for stabilizing large Naval Ships. To deny that they are relevant present day systems is ignoring the facts. The next innovative step was to engineer a system for producing continuous gyro reaction forces. Ignoring the creative engineering expansion of these <strong>same principles</strong> for the gyro motion machine is another unwarranted denial.</p><p>Contra Argument No. 3 - Forward motion requires a push against another surface and not gyro induced moment reaction.</p><p>Rebuttal: To say that forces and moments cannot be positioned and arranged in such a manner to allow forward motion with a stable frame and with cart wheels rolling on pavement is mistaken. This design utilizes the gyro reaction forces, which in turn creates a very beneficial prime mover. Documentation for the gyro cart model testing includes affidavits and certifications include several expert witnesses and several professional engineering reports.</p><p>Contra Argument No. 4 - Presentation of the Linear Newtonian Laws as opposition to gyro motion for a conclusion.</p><p>Rebuttal: Euler’s rotational dynamic classical sciences, with it’s classical methods of computations for power, work, moment, rotational speed, etc. are the applicable laws of motion for this, not Newton.</p><p>Contra Argument No. 5 – A body will remains at rest, until acted upon by an external force.</p><p>Rebuttal: The action of a normal auto type vehicle has a push type force against a paved surface. (The engine drives the tramission, drive shaft, rear end, and axle and therefore, the power train supply power to the rear wheels.) The reaction force from the pavement pushes against the vehicle. These action and reaction forces have normal linear vectors with equal opposite action and reaction force vectors. This machine however has another action against the paved surface, a moment type reaction of forces with their associated moment arm. This moment arm is the distance to the pivot point. The external forces of the pavement push against the wheels of the cart model. It is, however, in a moment to force type manner. This has been extensively developed in the above engineering analysis. Note that both types of actions, whether linear or rotational, induce a reaction from the pavement. Both are external forces. In short, the pavement exerts external forces to maintain a stable frame for the gyro motion machine. External forces are directly involved in the process of this gyro machine. External forces (gravitation) do indeed act upon the cart model, but in an appropriate and scientific manner for this machine to operate and to have purpose, function and utility. The cart model moves forward with force and has been abundantly, thoroughly and extensively proven. These external reaction forces of the pavement upon the cartwheels can't be dismissed or ignored. The required stability for the cart framing has been extensively shown in the engineering analysis, and has been even demonstrated physically.</p><p>A consensus against gyro propulsion should not be considered dis-positive in any manner, due to both the<strong> engineering analysis </strong>and the many <strong>cart model demonstrations</strong> for various sizes and configurations, which <strong>prove the principles.</strong> Demonstratively, the specific principles are solid and proven. In support, other independent sources have now become available for the gyro motion machine principles, specifically for the cart model.</p><h3>****End of Peer Review Article***</h3><h3>Short Summary</h3><p>Make sure to watch the above video's before proceeding. You will be watching an historical event in the first video.

We believe very strongly that the efficiency of this motion machine unit is going to be very exceptional. It will change many industries. It will provide a new era for mankind. We are older seasoned Mechanical Engineers, with good judgement. We are both over 60. Both of us have seen in person the resulting forces produced. Both of us are amazed that it has not made it to the forefront of our technical world yet. Others senior men have tried to promote the principles in their time.

They <strong>dedicated their later years </strong>to this project, but were unable to bring it to market. Both of these inventors were well know and renowned. Both have passed away. The two men are Eric Laithwaite and Fran McCabe, if you desire to do research on them.

The inefficiency for all existing propulsion crafts including both propellers and jets is <strong>very wasteful.</strong> Both are <strong>extremely dangerous </strong>and this would totally be eliminated. We expect to switch the manufactures and industries to gyro drivers. This would only occur if the performance efficiency is better than the current propulsion systems. If the efficiency is as expected, we would certainly begin our first replacement for air boats, then helicopters, then aircraft. This does not even mention the hobby industry, which includes drones. These will be converted as well. Think of the propeller <strong>crashes and accidents. </strong>Even with toy models, one <strong>recent death</strong> has occurred at a sports club.</p><p>I, William Cor, am a Mechanical Engineering graduate of The University of Wyoming, and the inventor, Walter Wood, is a Mechanical Engineering graduate of The Georgia Institute of Technology.

That's what I'm talking about - Come join us.Stop the Aerial Crashes - for planes, helicopters & jets. Stop the Accidental Deaths for all aerial crafts - Help us, by funding us. We believe in the near future that gyro crafts will be much safer than current technologies and much more economical. We have seen the strength and power of these units first hand, and cannot walk away from it. However more development is needed, but it is extremely promising, Please look at the testing runs already proving the concepts and the power. Each run is revealing, and each test proves more. Remember my sister in-law story of a near death experience, due to a single engine airplane propeller blade rotation after engine shut off. Read about the recent crashes in the news every week. Propeller or Rotor Blades will not be needed when this is developed and perfected. Aircraft fuel efficiency and speeds will be vastly improved. Many applications will be forth coming. Even tall vehicles will be assisted for higher speeds on road curves with gyro stabilization. Under water or boat applications will be done. Hopefully jets, due to low fuel efficiency, will be abandoned. The future is very bright, and looks much better, than it appears right now. It has many more benefits than just for one nation, but for all mankind including both fuel and safety improvements for all travel. Even ice braking power can be generated. Mountains overhangs or ledges will not effect the gyro unit. It is extremely versatile. Peer-Review Article to be published: Read this to the End of Peer Review Article!Introduction:The gyroscopic motion machine or gyro reaction drive, is a recent innovative discovery in versatile mechanical propulsion, independent of aerodynamic lift. Application submitted long prior to 2020, it has a patent pending status at the United States Patent and Trade Office, by Walter E. Wood, residing in Sylvester Georgia, USA. Applications of this multiple purpose innovation, if fully developed, could become vast and wide ranging. This new form of drive may be superior to many other historical innovations as a Prime Mover. It may even be on the order of the Wright Brothers discovery for powered flight, by means of lift. The new US Space Force would do well to explore and develop this technology. Many earlier attempts to demonstrate these new gyro motion principles were unsuccessful, due to incomplete understanding, in order to achieve the desired directional force.The unit expands the current science to include a continual reaction force due to the new design configuration of the mechanism. This new reaction force can be readily harnessed and become remarkably useful. It can produce forward motion for crafts or vehicles. It produces a force that is useful for other proposes as well. It has many utilities, and is very versatile, since only a stable frame is required. Ground unit applications will have one main gear-motor driver reaction force, applied through the framing onto a ground surface. For aerial crafts a tail rotor, very similar to helicopters, would resist a turning moment. This effectively establishes a stable frame, as well. By maintaining stability of the unit’s framing, aerial flight capacity can be achieved in principle. Two types of models have extensively proven typical ground travel with good forward motion with force. This was proven by uphill and up ramp testing for several models, with various configurations, including small and large size models. The models produce a forward motion that is consistent during extensive testing. Many parameter variations are available for adjustments. All testing was conducted and certified by professional engineers. Several engineers have completed affidavits for direct physical witness of different unit test runs. Some were made by video observations presented by the inventor. Other expert witnesses provided written affidavits as well, such as a machine shop owner.The USA patent office (USPTO) has been slow to recognize the actual application of the existing rotational science, therefore a continuing submittal process is ongoing, but will inevitably be accomplished with full patent approval. Spectacular runs are forthcoming. Testing has been video recorded over several years. Exact time frames are confidential due to patent laws for qualified older applications. The Provisional Patent Application was submitted 5/2/2012, and a full Utility 5/2/2013. The Utility Patent number is 13,886,257.Background and History of Prior DevelopmentsMuch of what is known about rotating dynamics of moving bodies, comes from a 17th century scientist, Leonhard Euler, soon after the related law of motion by Sir Isaac Newton.Today’s technology includes many related applications for gyroscopes (flywheels). Larger gyroscopic stabilizer units are used in Navy Vessels, to minimize the effects of ocean waves. Their reaction forces minimize the normal rotation of the ship. A much better vertical position is maintained preventing the ship from being tilted over.Many people are familiar with present day camera platform gyro stabilizers, These are smaller but react in the same manner for position stability.This new gyro motion machine is unique and is well beyond current technologies. It has never been utilized for propulsion or forward motion in any manner. It should be emphasized that this is only one step above existing present day gyro stabilizer capacity and function. But it has been previously ignored or misunderstood. Certainly it has not been developed. The simple expansion for this new development has escaped discovery, hiding in plain sight. In short, it is a simple step forward from existing established and proven gyro technologies. But this gyro craft provides continual and sustained forces, rather than temporary reactions. Power is likewise supplied continually and is sustained.Many on-line videos are available that show precession. Several You Tube videos show a rotating bicycle wheel for a typical demonstration. One could ignore this and say it is not a large powerful reaction. But the fact is that they do show a steady rotation or precession after an initial disturbance. Therefore, this shows a reaction torque clearly. And it also has an associated reaction force being shown. Therefore, it can be utilized as a force. But it is a temporary reaction, which results in a steady rotational motion with an angular velocity. The reaction is clearly visible. Therefore, these demonstrations show the reaction as a practical and useful principle. Making the reaction continual and sustained is possible, if properly configured within a new gyro motion machine. This will be discussed below in detail.Explanation & AnalysisThere are well known existing commercial gyroscopic applications. Many of which are currently utilized for stability and for guidance. Basically, a flywheel in rotation becomes gyroscopic in nature with a number of fundamental characteristics. One of the main characteristics is the “rigidity in space” nature, which is simply a resistance to any motion. It is better known as rotational inertia and is indeed a re-labeling of the same characteristic. When there is force applied to the axis of the flywheel there is a reaction force created. A temporary one is well known, and has several existing commercial applications for stability. Some examples of this include race cars, large ships, and camera platforms. A reset to the starting position is required for these existing stabilizer gyro units. This new gyro machine keeps the reaction force going by continually moving the gyroscopic rotating flywheel. It seems simple and could easily have been done much earlier in history. However, this is now a very current application for development. It is currently under much experimentation by the inventor. It includes many noted improvements for construction, but the principals are the same. There are some design parameters being adjusted for some better optimization, but the main principles remain.The reaction forces are continual due the design. See the sketch below for the conceptual design for the ground craft. The first machine being explained is the cart unit. Once the principal is understood for this unit the other units will be similar and more forthcoming.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gyro_Cart_Is... Gyroscopic Ground Craft Isometric Diagram ​The figure above shows the component parts. The electrical delivery system is not shown. For convenience, see the list below for the major parts.The major parts list for the Figure 1 is this; 1 gyro motor, 2 gyro flywheel, 5 shaft, 6 bearings, 8 core assembly wheel, 9 drive gear-motor, 10 & 11 pulleys or sheaves, 12 belt, 13 wheels, 21 framing, 31 flywheel rim weights.See the sketch below for part 1 of 2 of the external  force analysis - for gravity and the associated wheel reactions. The concepts were recently presented to the United States Patent and Trade Office, that show the force analysis for stability. For the technical astute it should be clear that a simple stability for the craft is all that is needed, for the reaction force to be harnessed for a good forward motion.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gyro_Analysi... Analysis of Gravity & Reactions for Gyro Craft ​The components include the core assembly wheel, gyro motors and flywheels, drive gear-motor, support framing, electrical brushes, bushings, wiring, bearings, shaft, pulleys, belt, hubs, switches, converters or power supply, and coaster wheels. Their sizing and configuration becomes the design parameters.Current models include 3 hobby crafts and a larger machine shop model. Current model runs are posted on YouTube. All have produced good forward motion. Craft weight range from 60 lb to 230 lb. A composite video, assembled with Pinnacle Studio, was presented to the United States Patent and Trade Office on 9-16-2019 for Chapters 1-12. See the link below for the model runs. The first 2 chapters are base line runs, without energized gyro flywheels demonstrating no motion without sustained gyro flywheel counter revolutions. Chapters 3 & 5 are hobby craft model runs uphill in a garage. The chapter 4 run is a mishap with a hobby cart unit with a narrow wheelbase or track, showing that a wider wheelbase is required for framing stability. It also shows the external forces at play. The next 2 runs, chapter 6 & 7, show a machine shop “strong model” on a level surface. The next 5 runs (Chapter 8-12) show this model going up ramps at 1.7% and 0.8% grade. Chapters 8 & 9 climb the 1.7% ramp. Chapter 10-12 utilized the 0.8% ramp. These videos were required to overcome the patent examiner’s critical comments and assertions.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BfpJX_qOdI To correct existing misleading notions and preconceived ideas for this simple machine, an expounded explanation for external reaction forces is appropriate. Included is a simple force to moment conversion diagram, illustrated below to save much discussion. It should be self-explanatory. The diagram is presented to show that the large reactionary moment of the gear-motor is actually converted to vertical forces. Then these forces are applied to the concrete floor surface through the cartwheels. It could even be said that the moment is being transformed and then transmitted. The cart ground unit resists overturning by reactions of the floor surface upon the unit’s wheels. The unit’s weight and the wheelbase work together. The induced external forces resist for two types of reactions in a simple manner. The cart remains stable for both its natural weight and for the induced moment of the unit’s drive gear-motor. Both types of external forces should be classified as ground reaction forces. This is expounded in a PE Certified Analysis for both the ground units and the aerial units. The major point is that both the frames of the ground units and aerial units are stable and allow the gyro machine to function.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:4_Force_to_M... Force to Moment Conversion DiagramFor a simple ground craft argument, an essential requirement is the framing stability. It is often overlooked. This requires both a substantial wheelbase and gravity of the unit working together to resist a substantial overturning moment. This allows the other systems in play to react with a forward force. The other systems include the gyroscopic reaction forces for forward motion.There is no push against a surface, but rather there is a significant and substantial moment conversion to a downward vertical force. This is not a linear push against type action. Linear reaction type analysis and equal opposite linear thinking is not appropriate in rotational dynamics. Linear dynamics and analysis is simpler and more commonly understood.See the sketch below for part 2 of the external force analysis. It clearly shows the Gear-Motor moment  and associated reactions, which allows for the cart stability, and thus allows the gyro mechanism to function successfully. Clearly the wheel base is a factor to prevent overturning.PlaceHolderAnalysis of External Reaction Forces for Gear Motor MomentAt this point, the major effort has not been to perfect the equations, but rather perfecting the craft models for proof. An extensive discovery of the sizing and design parameters is ongoing. It is notable that the governing equation is multidimensional  (vector based). While a simplifiFed statement for the resultant equation, in a practical manner, is limited (magnitude based). Even so the concept is relatively simple, once the visual demonstrations are observed.  It is progressive in model design and performance. All runs were conducted, documented, and videoed by a Licensed Professional Engineer, the inventor. Documents are PE certified for all submitted runs.Improved ramps for hobby craft are expected soon. Thus far the uphill for the hobby craft has been modest up slope of a typical garage floor. However, there are up ramp runs accomplished and documented for the machine shop model. The maximum up ramp grade of 1.7 % for these runs is approaching the normal maximum Rail Road grades of 2 %. These are seen in the above video’s. The video’s and data records are professional engineer certified by the inventor and a third party professional engineer. Both PE’s have completed a certification on the engineering principle analysis and a certification. The documents included a record  and witness of several model runs. Copies can be made available, upon request.The pending patent is very descriptive and is available on-line by searching Walter E. Wood, and the patent “Gyroscopic Motion Machine”.  There is no competition, since these are all unique designs for hobby craft sales and promotions. Depending on others is not now required, due to expected more impressive model runs. These can be posted on the internet or on the crowd funding sites. Also there are new research publication options. Many improvements were made and now the performance is at much higher levels. The previous hobby models were assembled with homemade components. Vibrations from initial methods have been substantially reduced. Many other areas of construction and assembly have become more professional as well. The designs allow for electrical delivery to accommodate the available hobby size dc motors. The patent descriptions and drawing are exact in principles and remain the same as per the original design. Only patent claim revisions were necessary to be totally inclusive, which was accomplished by a previous amendment. However, the analysis and explanation has been greatly expounded in great detail for the Request for Continued Examination to the United States Patent & Trade Office. (This is essentially a re-submittal of the Utility Patent Application for re-examination with the new supporting material.)  The evidence for approval should be adequate and approval is expected for the next review. (RCE was recently submitted by mail and received on 9/18/2019 by the United States Patent and Trade Office with postal receipts.)Perhaps, this article will initiate more academic support. The Georgia Center of Innovation, which is part of the Georgia Economic Development, has been supportive. Perhaps with more professional hobby craft model runs, it will be recognized for its potential merits more fully. Perhaps it has not been promoted well. More impressive runs for the hobby crafts should be forthcoming soon, under independent development. A major new hobby craft model has now been successful for some initial start up testing. New configurations for several different size hobby craft models are currently being developed at the same time.Technical and popular magazines are being evaluated to publish an opinion editorial. Other sponsorship avenues and some innovative contest are being evaluated. Even TV and other publication are being investigated for publicity assistance. Certainly, several crowd funding web site should be posted soon. Other social media postings are ongoing as well. Please offer suggestions if  something comes to mind.Physics and Math Details for a Predictive TheoryThese are the precepts, and one existing equation that will be developed, as more is understood of the resulting magnitude of the reaction force.“Standard Handbook for Mechanical Engineers” by Marks, 7th edition by Theodore Baumeister, McGraw Hill 1967, is copied in sections and inserted below to explain the older existing gyro stability technology. This equation will be useful as a starting point for later studies and developments. Gyroscopic forces are briefly illustrated in Fig. 73 on page 3-32 of the Handbook, which is copied here for reference.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Marks_Gyro_R... Mark's Mechanical Engineering Handbook - Gyro Reaction ForcesTaken from Mark’s - ""Let k = the radius of gyration of the wheel about it's axis. (If all the weight is at the rim, k2 =R2 ;"", or more simply k=R, where R is the radius of the rim weight.The reference diagram to the left is being utilized by the design of the flywheels with the concentrated weight on the outer part of the wheels. Only a few physical restrictions would limit the design, and the outer weight principle is being maximized, and captured by the design. This is commonly referred as “rim loading”.Taken from Mark’s - ""Now suppose that the axle end A is constrained to move between two smooth fixed guides, forming a slot;” ……. “then the mere motion of A along the slot will call into play a strong lateral pressure P (called a gyroscopic reaction) against one of the guides.”This lateral pressure “P” is indeed the resultant force being utilized for this new machine. All of the other aspects of the new machine can be optimized to maximize “P” above, that is continuous due to the unique design.Taken from Mark’s - “The magnitude of the gyroscopic force “P” at any instant is proportional to the spinning velocity, and also to the velocity of A along the slots, having given byPb=(w/g)(k2)(π N/30)(v/b)”Providing more explanation, changing it slightly for clarity to read,(P x b) = Moment = Force x Moment Arm = (w/g)(k2) ((π =3.14159)(N/30)(v/b)Taken from Mark’s - “where Pb = moment of P about the center, v = the linear velocity of the point A along the slot at the instant in question, N = rpm in the spinning velocity of the wheel, and g = 32.17 ft per sec.”  Note that “P” is the “gyroscopic reaction” force with a “strong lateral pressure ""P ”. The letter “w” is the weight of the disk flywheel in lbs.Also taken from Mark’s – “It should be noted that the gyroscopic reaction P against the fixed guide does not depend on the magnitude of the accelerating force Q, except in so far as Q is necessary to create the velocity  v,”It is well established that for gyroscopic devices including spinning flywheels, that when imposing a force “Q” at the end of its axle, a useable reaction always tends to move at right angles (normal) to the imposed force “Q”, as shown in this case. Accordingly, it will react with a force “P” when restrained at the same end in the respective direction.The illustration above illustrates an axle end “A”  that is constrained to move between the fixed guides, forming a slot. If force  “Q”  is applied to pull the point  “A”  along the slot, while the wheel is turning, the motion of  “A”  will cause a strong lateral pressure “P” as shown in the diagram. “P” is the gyroscopic reaction because of a change in the angular momentum caused by the force “Q”. The direction of the force “P” depends upon the direction of the spin and “Q”. The respective angular momentum vector is not shown in this simple diagram. The force directions for “Q” and “P” are clearly shown and are adequate for understanding of the action and reaction principles. Understanding that gyroscopic reactions are not equal and opposite as per Newton for a 0 & 180 configuration, but utilize the right hand rule per Euler and others to determine their direction, the application of this principle to the invention can be seen in the below diagram.It does require some imagination to get from the above diagram to the below diagram, but the principle is the same. The gyro flywheel motor’s rigid mounting is where the unique generated lateral force is applied by the gyroscopic reaction. Likewise, the Q force is applied there also. The ""b"" distance above is difficult to transfer exactly to the new unit's configuration. (The innovation's configuration is the gyro motor mounting arrangements with the respective attached flywheel.) It is clear that ""b"" is a constant factor that will be determined empirically.The new innovation’s configuration does not match the above Mark's diagram exactly; therefore more development of the above equation for this new gyro motion machine is required. The principle of the gyro reaction force does remain as a valid engineering forward resultant force, proven by the model runs to date. The above Mark's equation, however, can be a very good starting point. Therefore, the full equation development is a work in progress.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:2_Gyro_with_... Core Wheel with 2 gyro flywheels - Reaction Force Diagramhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Diagram_alte...Alternate with  Double Ended Motor The conservation of angular momentum is applicable to this unit. The rotation of the gyro flywheels are the energized components that allow energy to be released. Since this energy is available to be utilized, the conservation of angular momentum principle is not violated in any manner. The rotation of the flywheels is motorized, however, and therefore the RPM speed is maintained due to friction or other imperfections. As tests have shown when the unit core “assembly wheel” driver is energized during start up, the rotation of the all the gyro flywheels is disturbed and is affected. The energy is being transformed into forward motion, and the gyro flywheel motors are loaded. This is indicated by a change in speed of the energized flywheels. A slowdown is noticeable. Therefore the angular momentum is conserved, until the unit is started. Then some balancing occurs with a new reduced rpm speed of the gyro motors and respective flywheels. Then after stabilizing the gyro motors maintain their respective flywheel rpm speed. Thus the force forward is maintained for all the cart units presented, a certain forward speed is achieved. Thus all the submitted video’s are verified by Walter E. Wood, free from any doctoring, with all factors presented and fully disclosed in these documents. In fact, all the testing is verifiable and repeatable with the proper construction and assembly.The Table shown below is taken and manually typed from the College Textbook Physics 101 Course “Physics Part I” by Robert Resnick and David Halliday, published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 1966. This publication shows a comparison of scaler equations only and does not include the vector representation or directions. But there are great differences in the equations, and even more with the complete analysis including vector directional representation of all the functions or components, and are indeed two separate science categories. Therefore linear momentum equations and logic are too limited for the internal component analysis of this unit.The linear equal opposite aspects for normal straight-line rectilinear motion or the normal linear scientific equations should not be applied to this unit for understanding the concept. All the physics publications use the equations of linear motion for comparison only and not for the actual application of rotational kinematics. See the Table below taken from a Physics 101 Course Textbook. Only when the unit has achieved a steady traveling speed, can these linear principles be applied to the unit as a whole. This is indeed a gyroscopic functioning new machine with good utility. For the cart unit to be stabilized, there is a moment balance needed but not in a linear fashion. The needed resisting moment is achieved through the cartwheels by the pavement. The external vertical forces of the pavement acting upon the cartwheels with a moment arm create the resisting moment. Thus the linear equal opposite action reaction principle does not apply for this gyroscopic motion machine. As shown above all forces react normal to, and the applied moment by the drive motor is achieved, balanced, and stabilized by external pavement vertical forces. Since these external force are entirely vertical it has no effect upon the horizontal motion of the cart.As described in the specification of the pending  patent -“Gyroscopic Motion Machine“ A first gyro motor and flywheel turns counter-clockwise, and a second motor and flywheel turns clockwise, when viewed from the same vantage point, allowing the assembly wheel to create a reaction force, as it is rotated by a drive gear-motor.” The diagram above illustrates the reaction force or pressure created as a result of the change of angular velocity of the gyro flywheels and the applied force “Q” accomplished by the core “assembly wheel” rotation. Force “Q” is applied by the rotation of the assembly wheel, as the assembly wheel continuously applies force “Q” to the axle end of each flywheel, creating a continuous reaction force “P”. The normal force “Q” causes torque and a change in the angular momentum in the direction of that torque, which results in pressure or distributed force “P”, perpendicular to “Q”. Based on the principles governing the direction of that torque, the force of “P” will be same direction with reference to the flywheel axles when the flywheels are turning in opposite directions. (Looking in from the end of each flywheel.) Thus, there is a new force “P” that is generated by the conversion of force “Q” by the gyroscopic reaction, as shown in the above diagram. This conversion creates movement caused by force “P” via the gyroscopic motion machine described by the utility patent claims. Thus, the invention does not violate the principle of conservation of momentum, but rather obeys that principle as the force “P” induces an immediate reaction in a new direction, according to the right-hand rule in rotating bodies. Thus, the invention is demonstrated and proven to be operable according to known dynamics formulas and publications.

Future Potential Impact and Benefits of TechnologyConsider the existing propeller driven crafts, specifically air propeller systems. For example, an examination is required of typical airboat for its existing testing methods. The data reported by manufacturers' representatives of current and available commercial units shows an inefficient production of their output force. The testing method consists of a typical cattle weight scale positioned in line of a tie cable or chain, where the cable connects back to a tree on the shore with the boat floating in the water. The total power hp indication is not impressive. There is essentially no friction of the boat in the water. Therefore, it can be assumed that similar inefficient results take place for all propeller driven crafts. This implies that large hp engines are required that produce minimum force output. Force data is not yet available for the gyro crafts, but it is expected to be much better performance results than for air boats. All USA swamp fishermen know the inefficiencies of air boats, compared to normal water propeller boats or even special ""mud motor"" propeller driven boats.The range of utility is vast for the new gyro motion machine. In general, this should replace all propeller driven crafts due to efficiency, not to mention safety. Other new applications are too numerous to list completely. But the major list includes horizontal crafts on any surface including ice. Also included are aerial crafts, marine crafts, braking for any craft on any surface, overturning protection for tall vehicles, lifts for inconvenient locations or conditions.With minimum rocket boosters to prevent a space ship rotation, it could be used for propulsion for space ships. The initial burst or burn is all that is needed since there is no friction in space and the ship’s forward velocity would be maintained with no depleting. Remember the movie Back to the Future  – “Roads! Where we’re going, we won’t need roads!” We would ask you to consider the possibility of having hovering vehicles, hovering chairs, increased land speeds for tall vehicles, increased lift for all craft, compact and safe crafts for maneuvering on the side of cliff walls, safe tree work and inspections without booms. Please consider real braking capacity for ice travel. Not to mention a hovering craft for safe fire fighting work. There are extensive applications for this new innovation.Overcoming the Status Quo BiasThese are some explanations to correct existing misleading notions and preconceived ideas for this simple machine.First, the main principles for this gyroscopic motion machine require the use and understanding of rotational dynamics which was established by Leonhard Euler. Euler was Swiss and lived from 1707 to 1783. Euler’s work is well accepted as a classic era physicist for rotation. The specific reference for angular momentum is Euler's Laws of Motion. His work was 50 years later than Newton. Therefore in principle, this type rotational system is on an equal level with Newtonian physics. Rotational Physics is a separate science with different equations for motion. Newton encompasses Linear Laws of Motion and Euler encompasses Rotational Laws of Motion with the relevant equations. (Euler's Second Law is the accepted classical science for rotational physics.)In addition, the most common mistake is Linear thinking for equal opposite reaction forces, since it is simple and more customary in normal mechanical systems. It is customary for tire traction systems for common vehicles. It consists of a common push against type action and reaction system.Second is the free space evaluation. This is not applicable since the gyro motion machine works in a normal environment, with both gravity and normal atmospheric conditions. That is with gravity to assist in stability for ground units. And for aerial crafts, gravity is overcome but is still utilized for stability, but requires additional detailed force and moment analysis.Last is the Reactionless drive nomenclature. This unit does not use propellants. The external forces and gyroscopic reaction forces are well explained in Professional Engineering certified analysis. First, the analysis for the ground craft unit is considered to assist understanding. The gyro cart has a force to moment conversion with vertical upward external force. Both this external reaction force and gravity of the craft work together for stability of the unit. The crafts wheelbase is also a factor for stability. This design does not have a horizontal push against a floor surface but rather an equivalent moment reaction by upward external reaction forces of the floor surface. Friction is not applicable, or any other misapplied factors for dismissing these model video runs. Only the pure gyro reaction forces are being utilized, which are well proven and repeatable. With a power supply, they are continual. Base line runs are included showing a well balanced core rotation with no energized flywheels. Therefore, the experimental methods have been professional.Unsuccessful Developments by OthersTo explain the lack of success by others previously, consider the following. No one has presented this exact design. For the current scientific communal posted analysis, the main problem, perhaps, is that no available units existed or were available for study. Maintaining secrecy due to prior patent laws may have hindered the sharing and posting of some inventors. Therefore, it is very easy to discredit an unknown and unproven science where no successful models exist.Initially without any prior examples, there was some difficulty to construct good working models. There were no available resources for reference. For the best relevant history, Google search for two well renowned men who were pioneers in their day, the late Eric Laithwaite, formerly citizen of UK, and the late Francis J. McCabe, formerly of Mt. Airy, PA. These two men spent their later years attempting to bring a gyro craft to market, but were not successful. They both understood the power and associated benefits of gyroscopic reaction forces, and hoped to see it harnessed in some manner. McCabe published his gyro motion machine demonstration and test after the provisional patent was filed by Walter E. Wood, see below the link listed his web site. McCabe labeled it the Vehicle Gyro Oscillation Drive Model. His demonstration model was partially air and partial electric powered, but the principle are the same. McCabe utilized a single air powered flywheel in lieu of a pair of flywheels.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kyzd3BaDm0&amp... Again, no one has presented this exact design. Therefore, others with limited funds, and perhaps limited time were not able to make any commercial success by providing reasonable hobby toy models. The parts and materials are much simpler and this commercial barrier has been broken now. The parts have been standardized and economized. They include wheels, hubs and other manufactured components to perfect the unit, especially the gyro flywheels. Continuous improvements of construction techniques is ongoing and required for economics and performance. To prove the function and capacity, spectacular models with several configurations will be forthcoming and scheduled. The boundaries set by others has been breached. Others did not build successful running models for commercial consumption. These new designs, allow hobbyist to build good working models. In short, other innovators stopped or were stopped by circumstances. Therefore, the scientific community, as yet, has not fully considered the value of these gyro motion machines. All that is required is the power supply, a productive arrangement of gyros, a counter rotation to release the reaction, and a stable frame. This is also the first steps required to understand the science of this unit.Prior Publications & The Need for Additional DevelopmentThe gyro motion machine has been demonstrated in several on-line videos of models and at least one on-line study. The late scientist Fran McCabe, completed the one on-line study. However, it includes discussions about many associated experiments.Francis J. McCabe's presented all of his experiments for gyro motion, including the failed experiments. This is very confusing. It is known now, that the real concern is the appropriate testing results of a practical design for his cart models and especially its proof video runs. Never the less, McCabe's report, with the associated experiments, is extremely useful for those who are familiar with the true gyroscopic principles.Perhaps, McCabe was trying to express in his gyro motion study, that gyroscopic behavior occurs in nature more than generally realized. But it does not serve the study of this for simplifying and promoting a clear understanding. It extremely cluttered the material and became confusing. Therefore, it is not beneficial to add and support these far removed connections or relationships in nature. These things may be expounded at some later date.At this time, the math developments leave room for revisions with several factors to apply for the existing equations. The computations for the resulting outputs will require (as a minimum) substantial empirical development for the relevant formulas.Prior Omissions or Expert Misconception's in Dynamic Theories & DevelopmentsSeveral science reports from other sources have been previously accepted by a few in the science community that doubt gyro motion can be possible. The existing publications show a lack of willingness to build, experiment or to conduct open minded research. Below are specific arguments that have been raised. Each one is briefly discussed and put in their proper perspective.Contra Argument No. 1 - Propeller propulsion is proven and gyro propulsion is not.Rebuttal: Both of these have reaction force outputs. This is clearly visible with the new videoed and certified cart model runs of the gyro motion machine.Contra Argument No. 2. Existing gyro stabilizers for ships are not relevant.Rebuttal: These existing powerful systems produce large reaction forces for stabilizing large Naval Ships. To deny that they are relevant present day systems is ignoring the facts. The next innovative step was to engineer a system for producing continuous gyro reaction forces. Ignoring the creative engineering expansion of these same principles for the gyro motion machine is another unwarranted denial.Contra Argument No. 3 - Forward motion requires a push against another surface and not gyro induced moment reaction.Rebuttal: To say that forces and moments cannot be positioned and arranged in such a manner to allow forward motion with a stable frame and with cart wheels rolling on pavement is mistaken. This design utilizes the gyro reaction forces, which in turn creates a very beneficial prime mover. Documentation for the gyro cart model testing includes affidavits and certifications include several expert witnesses and several professional engineering reports.Contra Argument No. 4 - Presentation of the Linear Newtonian Laws as opposition to gyro motion for a conclusion.Rebuttal: Euler’s rotational dynamic classical sciences, with it’s classical methods of computations for power, work, moment, rotational speed, etc. are the applicable laws of motion for this, not Newton.Contra Argument No. 5 – A body will remains at rest, until acted upon by an external force.Rebuttal: The action of a normal auto type vehicle has a push type force against a paved surface. (The engine drives the tramission, drive shaft, rear end, and axle and therefore, the power train supply power to the rear wheels.) The reaction force from the pavement pushes against the vehicle. These action and reaction forces have normal linear vectors with equal opposite action and reaction force vectors. This machine however has another action against the paved surface, a moment type reaction of forces with their associated moment arm. This moment arm is the distance to the pivot point. The external forces of the pavement push against the wheels of the cart model. It is, however, in a moment to force type manner. This has been extensively developed in the above engineering analysis. Note that both types of actions, whether linear or rotational, induce a reaction from the pavement. Both are external forces. In short, the pavement exerts external forces to maintain a stable frame for the gyro motion machine. External forces are directly involved in the process of this gyro machine. External forces (gravitation) do indeed act upon the cart model, but in an appropriate and scientific manner for this machine to operate and to have purpose, function and utility. The cart model moves forward with force and has been abundantly, thoroughly and extensively proven. These external reaction forces of the pavement upon the cartwheels can't be dismissed or ignored. The required stability for the cart framing has been extensively shown in the engineering analysis, and has been even demonstrated physically.A consensus against gyro propulsion should not be considered dis-positive in any manner, due to both the engineering analysis and the many cart model demonstrations for various sizes and configurations, which prove the principles. Demonstratively, the specific principles are solid and proven. In support, other independent sources have now become available for the gyro motion machine principles, specifically for the cart model.****End of Peer Review Article***Short SummaryMake sure to watch the above video's before proceeding. You will be watching an historical event in the first video. Otherwise this will not have any meaning. CATCH LINE: If you want to see higher, faster, longer flying drones in the future, then support us. We are the smart ones I am told. As Professional Engineers, we are standing on it, within 3 years, tops. We can get it done with support for the patent battle and the new development parts. We have verified the power and the motion with actual test. We are ready to perfect it for utility, other than hobby models, which we already have. See all the perks to make a choice. Otherwise pure donations will be 100% applied to the emergency needs. OVERVIEW: This is our Emergency Patent Defense for Drones - Gyro Powered. This project is our life's passion. We believe very strongly that the efficiency of this motion machine unit is going to be very exceptional. It will change many industries. It will provide a new era for mankind. We are older seasoned Mechanical Engineers, with good judgement. We are both over 60. Both of us have seen in person the resulting forces produced. Both of us are amazed that it has not made it to the forefront of our technical world yet. Others senior men have tried to promote the principles in their time. This unit would reduce the carbon foot print, since it would be much more fuel efficient.We are continuing this new science that was started by two other major inventors. They dedicated their later years to this project, but were unable to bring it to market. Both of these inventors were well know and renowned. Both have passed away. The two men are Eric Laithwaite and Fran McCabe, if you desire to do research on them. Eric Laithwaite's video is worth a look to see the vertical lift available for our machine, which will be build with your help, see the link below. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHlAJ7vySC8 Please go to the GALLERY next to see the actual working models. One recently in the garage is our best run so far with multiple gyro pairs in a small model. It traveled about 11 feet in 1.5 minutes. Another one shows the very first run in the inventor's home. Two runs are of a larger single pair model going forwards and backwards. All of them are historical.Our offers are still available and are included for models to build with wood kits for home hobbyist projects. We will send any packages that are selected and purchased. See the additional perks for each of the wood hobby kits. Select and click the link that you prefer. You will not need the assembly instructions since it is included in the wood kits. Different size packages or plans are available. The kits only include the wood parts needed. The list of other hardware parts is included in the instructions. It includes the gear-motors, gyro motors and converters model numbers, etc. Please go to the GALLERY next to see the actual appearance of the wood part kits shown on the first video of the inventor Walter Wood. (For the 10 pair model.) The parts may change slightly, but the overall design and function are the same. A properly sized gear motor has been added for the small units, as well as a 120 vac to 14 vdc converter for a very good and convenient power supply.We have done the math for propeller type aircraft, and we believe that with a perfected product we will be able to replace all propeller drivers in a timely manner. The inefficiency for all existing propulsion crafts including both propellers and jets is very wasteful. Both are extremely dangerous and this would totally be eliminated. We expect to switch the manufactures and industries to gyro drivers. This would only occur if the performance efficiency is better than the current propulsion systems. If the efficiency is as expected, we would certainly begin our first replacement for air boats, then helicopters, then aircraft. This does not even mention the hobby industry, which includes drones. These will be converted as well. Think of the propeller crashes and accidents. Even with toy models, one recent death has occurred at a sports club.I, William Cor, am a Mechanical Engineering graduate of The University of Wyoming, and the inventor, Walter Wood, is a Mechanical Engineering graduate of The Georgia Institute of Technology.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Born from the need seen by teachers and parents, ScholarWorx is reforming K-12 Education with the use of immersive, virtual reality learning on our newly built ScholarWorx Virtual Campus.</p>
<p>Teacher and mom of five, Desirée Schell watched with dismay as Covid-altered education removed engagement for many students. As a writer and artist and travel leader, Desirée missed delivering instruction using a multi-sensory approach that other chat- or video-based platforms don’t allow. Desirée began to look for a way to harness the current challenges in education, her experience in banking and marketing, and her love for imparting learning to making education better for our kids—and saw a ground-breaking opportunity in creating a safe, virtual, immersive campus for K-12. Desirée has invested her retirement funds into purchasing the ScholarWorx Virtual Campus and outfitting it for educational reform.</p>
<p>Fellow teacher and mom Karen Cangero has partnered with Desirée to bring ScholarWorx Virtual Campus to life. An elementary and math teacher and the author of two books on using the Internet for kids, Karen is ready to tap into the incredible technology in today’s world to make learning and education better for kids. Having taught nearly every grade from K through 12, Karen recognizes the importance of engaging students. Students who do are students who learn.</p>
<p>Contributors, you will be helping Desirée and Karen offer those essential immersive experiences for students on the ScholarWorx Virtual Campus. These 550+ activities are standards-based and curriculum-aligned—spanning learning from early elementary to SAT/ACT Prep and AP. On the ScholarWorx Virtual Campus, students and teachers interact as avatars and will benefit from these immersive experiences in all disciplines. You will help bring learning alive for today’s students as they put their avatar hands on state-of-the-art educational activities! We welcome your support and excitement.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>ScholarWorx needs $10,000 in funding to offer the immersive, virtual activities on our ScholarWorx Virtual Campus:</p>
<ul>
<li>$2,850 for VEATIVE Immersive Technology Solutions for 550 hands-on student adventures (grades 3-12) into Math, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, World History and more!</li>
<li>$ 2,700 for Teacher Trainings</li>
<li>$1,500 for Student Ocular Viewers</li>
<li>$2,700 for Teacher Ocular Headsets</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Items are listed in order of importance. </i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Funding will be by priority if our full funding goal is not met.</i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The struggles of education in the time of Covid have been national and world news. Nearly everyone knows students, parents, teachers—or all of the above—who have felt frustrated and disenfranchised in the last year. Our kids have struggled their way through traditional schooling, online instruction, video conference lessons, and concurrent teaching in the classroom during the pandemic. What do our kids need? Engagement—meaningful lessons that speak to their world and the way they currently learn. We can do better for them by  jumping forward into their world, and stop pulling them back into ours. Education is the cornerstone of our society--and it needs help.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Born from the need seen by teachers and parents, ScholarWorx is reforming K-12 Education with the use of immersive, virtual reality learning on our newly built ScholarWorx Virtual Campus.
Teacher and mom of five, Desirée Schell watched with dismay as Covid-altered education removed engagement for many students. As a writer and artist and travel leader, Desirée missed delivering instruction using a multi-sensory approach that other chat- or video-based platforms don’t allow. Desirée began to look for a way to harness the current challenges in education, her experience in banking and marketing, and her love for imparting learning to making education better for our kids—and saw a ground-breaking opportunity in creating a safe, virtual, immersive campus for K-12. Desirée has invested her retirement funds into purchasing the ScholarWorx Virtual Campus and outfitting it for educational reform.
Fellow teacher and mom Karen Cangero has partnered with Desirée to bring ScholarWorx Virtual Campus to life. An elementary and math teacher and the author of two books on using the Internet for kids, Karen is ready to tap into the incredible technology in today’s world to make learning and education better for kids. Having taught nearly every grade from K through 12, Karen recognizes the importance of engaging students. Students who do are students who learn.
Contributors, you will be helping Desirée and Karen offer those essential immersive experiences for students on the ScholarWorx Virtual Campus. These 550+ activities are standards-based and curriculum-aligned—spanning learning from early elementary to SAT/ACT Prep and AP. On the ScholarWorx Virtual Campus, students and teachers interact as avatars and will benefit from these immersive experiences in all disciplines. You will help bring learning alive for today’s students as they put their avatar hands on state-of-the-art educational activities! We welcome your support and excitement.

What We Need & What You Get
ScholarWorx needs $10,000 in funding to offer the immersive, virtual activities on our ScholarWorx Virtual Campus:

$2,850 for VEATIVE Immersive Technology Solutions for 550 hands-on student adventures (grades 3-12) into Math, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, World History and more!
$ 2,700 for Teacher Trainings
$1,500 for Student Ocular Viewers
$2,700 for Teacher Ocular Headsets

Items are listed in order of importance. 
Funding will be by priority if our full funding goal is not met.

The Impact
The struggles of education in the time of Covid have been national and world news. Nearly everyone knows students, parents, teachers—or all of the above—who have felt frustrated and disenfranchised in the last year. Our kids have struggled their way through traditional schooling, online instruction, video conference lessons, and concurrent teaching in the classroom during the pandemic. What do our kids need? Engagement—meaningful lessons that speak to their world and the way they currently learn. We can do better for them by  jumping forward into their world, and stop pulling them back into ours. Education is the cornerstone of our society--and it needs help.
Your contribution is joining our movement for educational reform. ScholarWorx Virtual Campus uses technology to educate, engage, and unite our students—our future. We are breaking ground in melding virtual reality and education. Help us take this first step in creating meaningful reform in education that is sure to spread across our country and the globe.

<p>The app will work like this:</p>
<p>-it will use voice recognition to detect a pass phrase set up by the user. When that phase is picked up on by the app. It will immediately reach out to all the safety contacts you have programmed in your phone. It will give GPS Location, rate of speed, and direction so anyone receiving the notification call the police on behalf of your loved one. It will also have a second passcode for the phone that when entered will do the exact same thing.</p>
<p>-the app will have a panic button on it as well for when your loved one is so frightened they cant think properly.</p>
<p>-the app will have an automatic crash detection. If Jacobs wall detects sudden drops in speed and severe impact it will notify 911 and all the contacts in the emergency list for GPS Location.</p>
<p>-It will have very simple easy to use instructions on Naloxone/Narcan. When life or death is on the line we need to make it as easy as possible for someone to make the right decisions.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""http://teenthinktankproject.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Give teens the voice, skills and confidence to change the world they will inherit!</a></h3>
<p>Today’s teens will be inheriting a number of major societal issues, including: racism, gender inequality, poverty, bullying, higher education costs, and food insecurity.  In addition to these global issues, students are facing problems that are germane to their own schools and communities.  We cannot expect the next generation to address societal issues if they are exposed to the same hyper-partisanship and divisiveness that plague our current society.  And when the traditional educational system is hampered by inequitable funding, overworked staff, extracurricular program cuts, a focus on standardized testing (and not to mention the practical limitations by COVID-19), students struggle to gain the resources, tools and skills that will allow them to engage in the process of making their world a better place. </p>
<p>How do we change course from entrenched partisanship to a culture of cooperation and empathy to create a positive, highly functional future society?  A mediator and political scientist think they have the solution.  Motivated by their shared passion for creating a positive change in the world and empowering others to rise as leaders, Matthew DeSantis and Kelly Nagle founded Teen Think Tank Project to provide the next generation of leaders, change makers, and advocates with the academic, emotional, and practical skills needed to not only understand today’s societal issues, but correct them.  We're asking for your support to further our vision of giving a future generation of change agents a voice in the world they will inherit. </p>

</div><div>
<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Teen Think Tank Project is a student-run policy institute that fosters critical thinking, research techniques, and problem-solving skills to develop policy frameworks for real-life issues and empowers students to become future changemakers.</p>
<p>Our program enrolls students using merit-based, competitive criteria.  Students are provided with leadership training to help them develop effective communication and critical thinking skills.  We give them access to the resource materials that are needed to effectively research, develop, and present a public policy framework that will serve to not only provide a suggested blueprint for possible change, but also inspire experts and thought leaders to reimagine how they can utilize perspectives of the next generation of changemakers to play a role in solving today’s problems.  </p>

<h3>How We Work</h3>
<p>We enroll high achieving high school students, team them with a research coordinator, call them all “colleagues”  and treat them like professionals.  We give them access to thought leaders, advocates, activists, and industry experts to learn about social justice issues that are currently plaguing society,  examining the progress (or lack therefore) that these individuals have made in attempting to correct these societal issues, and walk students through social policy research, formation, and publication.</p>
<p>By fostering a learning environment that focuses on inclusion and diversity, our students are able to tackle societal issues in a safe environment.   We offer twelve weeks of learning modules through a virtual, in-person or hybrid learning environment that guide students through a social justice education curriculum that promotes equity, empathy and diversity, while enabling them to develop actual policy frameworks aimed at solving problems that affect their communities.   Students are provided with the curriculum, materials, instructors, and experts necessary to develop more effective communication, leadership, and problem solving skills. </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>

<p>Besides looking to how they can make an impact on society, our students are also looking towards their next steps into college.  Teen Think Tank Project's rigorous and innovative curriculum helps students stand out from their peers in their ability to lead, think critically and work in diverse environments.  These are qualities universities are seeking in applicants.</p>

<p>Any contribution is appreciated and supports our social justice education initiatives and equips our students to become the future change makers we need!</p>
<div> </div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>One of our values is creating a safe and diverse learning environment.  As we continue to grow our program and spread the word, we are mindful of being as inclusive and diverse as possible.  We are working to build relationships with school districts (public, private and charter) to ensure diversity of background, perspectives, race, socio-economic status, etc.  We realize that there are many exceptional and socially conscious teens who would excel in our program but lack the financial means to do so.  As such, we are dedicated to providing funding and scholarships to all accepted students.  Your contributions help us to do this.  </p>
<p>Building and marketing a business is no easy task.  With the combined business and fundraising backgrounds of the founders we are building a realistic and sustainable business model.  Additionally, initial support from industry leaders, activists, advocates and established business leaders has been overwhelming.  These amazing individuals have contributed their time and talents to our research cohort and our podcast, Here's the Problem.   </p>

Our program enrolls students using merit-based, competitive criteria.  Students are provided with leadership training to help them develop effective communication and critical thinking skills.  We give them access to the resource materials that are needed to effectively research, develop, and present a public policy framework that will serve to not only provide a suggested blueprint for possible change, but also inspire experts and thought leaders to reimagine how they can utilize perspectives of the next generation of changemakers to play a role in solving today’s problems.  

The Founders

How We Work
We enroll high achieving high school students, team them with a research coordinator, call them all “colleagues”  and treat them like professionals.  We give them access to thought leaders, advocates, activists, and industry experts to learn about social justice issues that are currently plaguing society,  examining the progress (or lack therefore) that these individuals have made in attempting to correct these societal issues, and walk students through social policy research, formation, and publication.
By fostering a learning environment that focuses on inclusion and diversity, our students are able to tackle societal issues in a safe environment.   We offer twelve weeks of learning modules through a virtual, in-person or hybrid learning environment that guide students through a social justice education curriculum that promotes equity, empathy and diversity, while enabling them to develop actual policy frameworks aimed at solving problems that affect their communities.   Students are provided with the curriculum, materials, instructors, and experts necessary to develop more effective communication, leadership, and problem solving skills. 
The Impact


Besides looking to how they can make an impact on society, our students are also looking towards their next steps into college.  Teen Think Tank Project's rigorous and innovative curriculum helps students stand out from their peers in their ability to lead, think critically and work in diverse environments.  These are qualities universities are seeking in applicants.

""Leadership is one of the best, and most impactful, ways to show character and exceptional extra curricular involvement, especially for Top 50 schools."" (https://www.huffpost.com/entry/leadership-what-...) 
""Colleges look for qualities like leadership and a sense of social responsibility."" (https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/get-in/apply...r)
""Colleges want students who appreciate cultural diversity and are eager to engage with and learn from people from a wide range of cultural backgrounds."" (https://www.collegedata.com/resources/getting-i...)

 
How You Can Make an Impact
We're raising money to execute research cohorts through April 2022 and continue to grow the Teen Think Tank Project .  This encompasses summer and fall 2021 sessions and winter 2022 cohorts, as well as additional social justice education programming.  

Any contribution is appreciated and supports our social justice education initiatives and equips our students to become the future change makers we need!
 
Risks & Challenges
One of our values is creating a safe and diverse learning environment.  As we continue to grow our program and spread the word, we are mindful of being as inclusive and diverse as possible.  We are working to build relationships with school districts (public, private and charter) to ensure diversity of background, perspectives, race, socio-economic status, etc.  We realize that there are many exceptional and socially conscious teens who would excel in our program but lack the financial means to do so.  As such, we are dedicated to providing funding and scholarships to all accepted students.  Your contributions help us to do this.  
Building and marketing a business is no easy task.  With the combined business and fundraising backgrounds of the founders we are building a realistic and sustainable business model.  Additionally, initial support from industry leaders, activists, advocates and established business leaders has been overwhelming.  These amazing individuals have contributed their time and talents to our research cohort and our podcast, Here's the Problem.   

Other Ways You Can Help

Who Are We?



We are a user-rights initiative, focused on your Privacy Online, and on your Legal and Economic Rights.

Terms of Service; Didn't Read (""ToS;DR"", derived from the acronym ""TL;DR"") is a non-for-profit project centered on reviewing, summarizing and communicating the legal documents — such as Terms of Service, Privacy Policies, EULA's, etc. — from various services/websites across the web. None of us actually reads those walls of text — thus, ""I have read and agree to the Terms"" is the biggest lie on the web!
The project is fueled through donations, and maintained by a community of awesome volunteers from all around the world, both through our Forum, and our Subreddit.


  

What Do We Do?




ToS;DR aims at creating a transparent and peer-reviewed process to rate and analyse Terms of Service and Privacy Policies in order to create a rating from Grade A to Grade E.
To review a service, we have this procedure to follow:

We add the desired service to our database: Phoenix. 
We crawl the documents (ToS, Privacy Policy...) on the newly added service. 

A reviewer will highlight the interesting points from a service's document, which will give it a certain amount of points. More Info 

When the service is completely reviewed, its rating is published automatically both on our website and our Browser Extensions. 




Our Database
We have our own database, called Phoenix. There is where all the magic happens! We crawl documents from other services,

  Facebook's legal documents — screenshot taken on 01/11/2021. 
 then, we review specific phrases, which in turn will become Points.

  View Point 

finally, once the service is sufficiently reviewed, we will post the grade on tosdr.org, which will also be reflected on our Browser Extensions.


  

Our Accomplishments



We have reviewed hundreds of services, including Facebook, Google, Reddit, Twitter, and more on Phoenix!We are also proud of our recent layout redesign on our main page, developed by Justin Back. We have also made translations for the frontpage, which is now available in six languages! We have also been integrated in the DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials browser extension, which displays a more privacy-focused rating!
We have also made a lot of improvements on all of our platform, making it increasingly more accesible and user-friendly! We have made easy and automated processes on our Forum, to attend to people's requests and inquiries in a much more accessible manner.

 

Our Objectives



We've come so far since 2012, and we want to keep the project alive! For this, we want to communicate with you what we plan to do with your help:


Improve our websites and communities
We want to keep working on the code for our websites. We want to keep improving to deliver the best experience both for our users, and everyone else!

Community and PR improvements (Such as new designs, video material, documentation, and more!) — (Currently under planning.) 
Community translations. — (Currently under development, we have 6 languages on our frontpage by now!) 
A new Markdown Crawler. — (Implemented, but will need further corrections and improvements.) 





Server and Social Media Hosting
We need your help to keep hosting our servers, or — even better — to improve them in the future!Also, we want to keep our Social Media profiles moderated and in order, with more updates and communications with our users.

<h2>SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Welcome to our <strong>Summer Reading Program</strong> brought to you by <strong>The Adventures of a Rogue Swan!</strong></p>
<p>This summer we are running a <a href=""https://theadventuresofaro.wixsite.com/mysite/summer-reading-program"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Summer Reading Program</a> to <strong>help children fall in love with reading.</strong> Every summer students fall a bit behind in their reading and this year is especially difficult as <strong>so many students have fallen behind because of the Coronavirus pandemic</strong> and many don't have the means to catch up. <strong>This program is free</strong> to anyone who wants to participate. <strong>Parents and kids set their own goals</strong> and at the end of the summer <strong>everyone gets prizes for their participation.</strong></p>
<p>Children and their parents select their goals, the number and type of books they’d like to read and work with them to help them one-on-one to achieve their goals. So no matter their age or stage, the child is able to create attainable and achievable goals and reach them. This helps them build confidence not only in their reading but in themselves.</p>
<p><i><strong>We meet the kids where they are at and help elevate them to where they want to go...</strong></i></p>
<p>This year we decided our theme would be <strong>“overcoming obstacles.”</strong> We chose this theme especially because of all the hardship that has touched every family over the past year. As you’ll see each of our perks is named after <strong>a famous literary character</strong> who overcame incredible obstacles to achieve their goals and dreams. We want to inspire our kids to keep believing and keep trying <strong>no matter what!</strong></p>
<h2><strong>ABOUT US</strong></h2>
<p><a href=""https://theadventuresofaro.wixsite.com/mysite"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Adventures of a Rogue Swan (TARS)</a> is a ballet company that <strong>uses ballet to help children learn and grow.</strong> This outreach project focuses on <strong>literacy</strong> and is produced by Silent Fire Productions, <strong>a commercial ballet company</strong> that strives for new ways to introduce ballet to everyone, everywhere.</p>
<p>Children in our summer reading program are not required to read books about ballet but we have created <strong>a great summer reading list</strong> with wonderful stories about ballet, dancers, and other young heroes, and how they’ve overcome obstacles to reach their dreams - both in their home life and their career.</p>
<p><strong>Diversity and inclusion</strong> is also hugely important to us, especially now, and we've worked very hard to create resources that reflect the diverse and ever changing makeup of <strong>children in America.</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h2>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</h2>
<p>Donations cover the cost of prizes for the children participants and one-on-one support for them and their parents. In addition, for families who can't afford books your donation provides us with ways to help them get books.</p>
<p><strong>Prizes include;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ben &amp; Jerry's Gift Card</li>
<li>Certificate of Completion</li>
<li>Special Summer 2021 Reading Program Patch/Sticker</li>
<li>Free Book from TARS book collection</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Support includes;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Special intake meeting to set goals and better understand children's needs and interests</li>
<li>Virtual support throughout the program to check in and assist in goals being met</li>
<li>Fun reading and literacy activities for children to participate in</li>
<li>Documents to help parents to keep track of books read and process what was being read</li>
<li>Access to books</li>
</ul>
<p>And.....<strong>a Virtual End of Summer Celebration Party!!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>THE IMPACT</h2>
<p><strong>Reading is a superpower...</strong></p>
<p>A recent study study published in American Education Research Journal, following students in grades 1 through 6 over five summers, showed more than half of students lost an average of 39% of their total school year gains during the summer months, also known as ""summer slide."" <strong>And this was before the pandemic...</strong></p>
<p><strong>The American Libraries Association</strong> states that the benefits to readers in a summer reading program include:</p>
<ul>
<li>encouragement that reading become a lifelong habit</li>
<li>reluctant readers can be drawn in by the activities</li>
<li>reading over the summer helps children keep their skills up</li>
<li>the program can generate interest in the library and books</li>
<li>And it being summer, the program can just be good fun and provide an opportunity for family time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reading does so much for a child's confidence, cognitive skills but also their socio-emotional skills. Did you know...</p>
<p><strong>""Reading helps to develop a child's empathy skills as they get enthralled in a book with a storyline that has a character that has to learn some lesson. Empathy skills are a vital component to having healthy relationships in society.""</strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>CHALLENGES</h2>
<p>This program is also for reluctant readers who may need some additional encouragement to fall in love with reading. All need children need to feel they are being supported in their goals in order to achieve them and our challenge this summer is to make sure that each child in our program and their families get the specialized support they need to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>Thankfully we've had a bit of practice (about 20 years or so...) of working with kids!</p>
<p>We will be working with each family on an individual basis to address what their specific needs are and how we can address them.</p>

<p>Matina Banks ~ Director, Educator</p>
<p>Matina is a ballerina, educator and producer born in Northern Virginia and raised in New York City. She started The Adventures of a Rogue Swan (TARS) after using the arts to teach in New York City public school, most especially in the Bronx. While working in the Bronx, she fell in love with the children she worked with but always felt heartbroken that she couldn't do more to help them - especially teaching them not to give up on themselves or their dreams. She also fell in love with literacy, reading and children's books and used reading as a way to help her students feel empowered and gain access to the world. After 20 years of teaching, she has shifted her focus to working on more outreach including starting this Summer Reading Program through TARS.</p>

SUMMARY
Welcome to our Summer Reading Program brought to you by The Adventures of a Rogue Swan!
This summer we are running a Summer Reading Program to help children fall in love with reading. Every summer students fall a bit behind in their reading and this year is especially difficult as so many students have fallen behind because of the Coronavirus pandemic and many don't have the means to catch up. This program is free to anyone who wants to participate. Parents and kids set their own goals and at the end of the summer everyone gets prizes for their participation.
Children and their parents select their goals, the number and type of books they’d like to read and work with them to help them one-on-one to achieve their goals. So no matter their age or stage, the child is able to create attainable and achievable goals and reach them. This helps them build confidence not only in their reading but in themselves.
We meet the kids where they are at and help elevate them to where they want to go...

As you’ll see each of our perks is named after a famous literary character who overcame incredible obstacles to achieve their goals and dreams. We want to inspire our kids to keep believing and keep trying no matter what!

THE IMPACT
Reading is a superpower...
A recent study study published in American Education Research Journal, following students in grades 1 through 6 over five summers, showed more than half of students lost an average of 39% of their total school year gains during the summer months, also known as ""summer slide."" And this was before the pandemic...
The American Libraries Association states that the benefits to readers in a summer reading program include:

encouragement that reading become a lifelong habit
reluctant readers can be drawn in by the activities
reading over the summer helps children keep their skills up
the program can generate interest in the library and books
And it being summer, the program can just be good fun and provide an opportunity for family time.

Reading does so much for a child's confidence, cognitive skills but also their socio-emotional skills. Did you know...
""Reading helps to develop a child's empathy skills as they get enthralled in a book with a storyline that has a character that has to learn some lesson. Empathy skills are a vital component to having healthy relationships in society.""
 

CHALLENGES
This program is also for reluctant readers who may need some additional encouragement to fall in love with reading. All need children need to feel they are being supported in their goals in order to achieve them and our challenge this summer is to make sure that each child in our program and their families get the specialized support they need to achieve their goals.
Thankfully we've had a bit of practice (about 20 years or so...) of working with kids!
We will be working with each family on an individual basis to address what their specific needs are and how we can address them.

 
THE TEAM



Matina Banks ~ Director, Educator
Matina is a ballerina, educator and producer born in Northern Virginia and raised in New York City. She started The Adventures of a Rogue Swan (TARS) after using the arts to teach in New York City public school, most especially in the Bronx. While working in the Bronx, she fell in love with the children she worked with but always felt heartbroken that she couldn't do more to help them - especially teaching them not to give up on themselves or their dreams. She also fell in love with literacy, reading and children's books and used reading as a way to help her students feel empowered and gain access to the world. After 20 years of teaching, she has shifted her focus to working on more outreach including starting this Summer Reading Program through TARS.
