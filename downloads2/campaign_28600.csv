</div><h3><span>Help Fund the travel book 'Nepal Before the Crisis' and/or support my completion of the Budapest Marathon, in aid of two worthwhile charities, both of whom are working hard to save lives in Nepal.</span></h3><br/><p>I am Duncan Lanser, writer of the travel book ‘North to Lalibela: Searching for Ethiopia,’ recently published in paperback and as an eBook, and available here:</p><br/><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/North-Lalibela-Searching-Ethiopia-Travels/dp/1508445087"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/North-Lalibela-Searchin...</a></p><br/><p>Nepal and its people are close to my heart, having spent five weeks in the country in April/May last year. I spent time in the capital, Kathmandu, before embarking on a trek along the old trailhead, used by the early explorers, from Jiri to the Everest region, which took 25 days and involved several high passes and peaks of over 5,000 metres above sea level. It was a challenging, enlightening, and remarkable experience.</p><br/><p>However, on 25 April 2015, a massive earthquake struck Nepal, leaving over 8,000 dead, around 18,000 injured, and at least 500,000 people homeless. A number of damaging aftershocks followed, before a second quake then rocked the country on 12 May 2015.</p><br/><p>People in Nepal are suffering. It is now thought that the number of displaced people across the country is around 3 million. Aftershocks are occurring every day, causing further damage to cracked and already dangerous buildings. Survivors need clean water, food, sanitation, and medical supplies. Not to mention psychological support. In addition, many homes and buildings providing vital services, like schools and hospitals, have been destroyed and must be rebuilt.</p><br/><p>This project aims to raise as much money as possible to support the relief effort in Nepal. I am writing about my experience there last year and, with your help and support, my second travel book, ‘Nepal Before the Crisis,’ will be ready in around 3 months' time. </p><p>In addition, on 11 October this year, I will run the Budapest Marathon - 26.2 miles of grit, determination, and pain, all for the same cause. I ran the London Marathon in 2012 and have thus already encountered the extreme difficulty of going beyond ‘the wall!’</p><br/><p>All profits from this project will go to support the relief efforts of two charities - Unicef and The Britain-Nepal Medical Trust - both of whom are already ‘in on the ground’ in Nepal and engaged in saving lives.</p><br/><p><b>WHAT IMPACT WILL YOUR HELP HAVE?</b></p><br/><p><b><i>The monsoon season is here and could wreak havoc on Nepal's fragile recovery.</i></b></p><br/><p>The monsoon season has arrived in Nepal. Food is scarce and clean water supplies are running out. The monsoon brings flooding and landslides and therefore an increased risk of waterborne disease, damage to property, and further loss of life. </p><br/><p>Half a million people in the Kathmandu valley alone are living in makeshift camps - simple tents or basic, unstable structures with tarpaulin roofs. The number now homeless across Nepal is thought to be over 3 million. </p><br/><p>Your money will help to provide clean water, food, sanitation and medical supplies, and to help rebuild homes and other vital structures devastated by the earthquakes.</p><br/><p>This project will help to fund two different organisations:</p><br/><p>1. <b>Unicef</b> - a large international charity that is operating in Nepal and significantly  involved in the relief effort, with a particular focus on the needs of children.

</div></div>","Help Fund the travel book 'Nepal Before the Crisis' and/or support my completion of the Budapest Marathon, in aid of two worthwhile charities, both of whom are working hard to save lives in Nepal.I am Duncan Lanser, writer of the travel book ‘North to Lalibela: Searching for Ethiopia,’ recently published in paperback and as an eBook, and available here:http://www.amazon.co.uk/North-Lalibela-Searchin...Nepal and its people are close to my heart, having spent five weeks in the country in April/May last year. I spent time in the capital, Kathmandu, before embarking on a trek along the old trailhead, used by the early explorers, from Jiri to the Everest region, which took 25 days and involved several high passes and peaks of over 5,000 metres above sea level. It was a challenging, enlightening, and remarkable experience.However, on 25 April 2015, a massive earthquake struck Nepal, leaving over 8,000 dead, around 18,000 injured, and at least 500,000 people homeless. A number of damaging aftershocks followed, before a second quake then rocked the country on 12 May 2015.People in Nepal are suffering. It is now thought that the number of displaced people across the country is around 3 million. Aftershocks are occurring every day, causing further damage to cracked and already dangerous buildings. Survivors need clean water, food, sanitation, and medical supplies. Not to mention psychological support. In addition, many homes and buildings providing vital services, like schools and hospitals, have been destroyed and must be rebuilt.This project aims to raise as much money as possible to support the relief effort in Nepal. I am writing about my experience there last year and, with your help and support, my second travel book, ‘Nepal Before the Crisis,’ will be ready in around 3 months' time. In addition, on 11 October this year, I will run the Budapest Marathon - 26.2 miles of grit, determination, and pain, all for the same cause. I ran the London Marathon in 2012 and have thus already encountered the extreme difficulty of going beyond ‘the wall!’All profits from this project will go to support the relief efforts of two charities - Unicef and The Britain-Nepal Medical Trust - both of whom are already ‘in on the ground’ in Nepal and engaged in saving lives.WHAT IMPACT WILL YOUR HELP HAVE?The monsoon season is here and could wreak havoc on Nepal's fragile recovery.The monsoon season has arrived in Nepal. Food is scarce and clean water supplies are running out. The monsoon brings flooding and landslides and therefore an increased risk of waterborne disease, damage to property, and further loss of life. Half a million people in the Kathmandu valley alone are living in makeshift camps - simple tents or basic, unstable structures with tarpaulin roofs. The number now homeless across Nepal is thought to be over 3 million. Your money will help to provide clean water, food, sanitation and medical supplies, and to help rebuild homes and other vital structures devastated by the earthquakes.This project will help to fund two different organisations:1. Unicef - a large international charity that is operating in Nepal and significantly  involved in the relief effort, with a particular focus on the needs of children. The charity has thus far provided clean water for 300,000 people, temporary toilet facilities for 65,000 people, and reached 800,000 children with a vital, pre-monsoon vitamin A supplement and deworming campaign; and2.  The Britain-Nepal Medical Trust - a charity established in 1967 in the UK, and also registered in the U.S, which has a long history in Nepal and is already involved in helping people in the mountainous areas hardest hit by the earthquakes, but which are difficult for large international charities to reach.Your contribution will help to save lives.WHAT DO WE NEED AND WHAT WILL YOU RECEIVE?You can contribute to this campaign in the following ways:1. Help fund the writing and publication of my travel book, 'Nepal Before the Crisis' and receive a copy of the book, which will be ready within 3 months of us reaching the funding target; or2. Contribute to my Budapest Marathon effort and receive a personal thank you from me by post; or3. Support both the writing of ‘Nepal Before the Crisis’ and my Marathon effort; or4. Support the writing of 'Nepal Before the Crisis,' and my Marathon effort, and purchase my existing travel book, 'North to Lalibela: Searching for Ethiopia;' or4. Make a donation of £5 and receive a personal thank you from me; or5. Make a donation of an amount you can afford, however large or small.There will be campaign and production costs, which may reach a maximum of 30% of the £10,000 target, but the remaining 70% will all go to charity. If we can raise in excess of £10,000, the campaign costs will be a smaller proportion of the overall funding and the percentage paid to the charities will increase. 'Nepal Before the Crisis' will take approximately 3 months to complete and will be a standard paperback/eBook of around 200 pages. UK contributors will receive a paperback copy and international contributors an eBook. High postage costs make it uneconomical to send paperbacks overseas. Although the book will take 3 months to complete, once the funding target has been reached, the monies going to the two charities will be paid immediately, in order that the funds can be quickly utilised to help the relief effort.

</p><p><b>Background:</b></p><p><b></b></p><p>I have been a volunteer at
orphanages for more than 5 years. Seeing how orphanages crave for donations and
kids live in such limited conditions, motivated us to find a solution to solve it once
for all. We came out with a model where the orphanage can be self sufficient on
its operational expenses from year 3 onwards. We are searching for funding
for initial land down payment.  Once we have access to the land, we
can get volunteers to help us with building the infrastructure and food
production so we can take care of the kids.</p>

<p>We intend to build a
financially self-sufficient Sustainable Orphanage with state of the art education system. The objective is to reach
autonomy in our operational expenses by implementing an Orphanage in a rural
area where we can provide food, shelter, education, legal assistance and health
services to abandoned / orphan children from urban areas in the state of
Chiapas, Mexico. </p>
<p>By focusing in improving
their self-esteem and healing of the past, leadership, team-work, social and
work skills, we aim not only to be an assistencialist organization focused to
keep children safe while they reach adulthood, but committing to their success
with clear objectives and measures following up after they leave the orphanage.
</p>
<p>Sustainability is a pillar
for our organization. By establishing it on a rural natural environment,
growing our own food, sustainable construction techniques, solar water heating, electricity generation, caring for the water
and the pollution foot print with state of the art sustainable methodologies,
our graduates will become sustainable educators and lead by example,
transforming the society they live in.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the Australian organic food production
technique known as Permaculture will provide food for the children. Since we will own the land, there is no rent
to pay. Services (internet, transport) and salaries will be covered with the
product of selling the surplus of the food production and trough the income
from sustainability workshops to urban and rural organizations. Receiving
international volunteers will help us to teach languages and diverse skills to
the kids.</p>
<p>The founder and director of
this initiative worked seven years for Procter &amp; Gamble as a senior manager
in 4 different departments such as operations, maintenance, project management,

budgets of over 3 million per project. This experience gave him the enterprise
management skills, market defined result-driven approach, with the goal to
become “best in class trough innovation” that will be applied to the newly
build organization Casa Hogar Sustentable. The director was awarded one of the
20 entrepreneurs of the future by Young Entrepreneurs Organization (YEO),

<p><b>The problem we solve:</b></p>
<p>1) Abandoned Children</p>
<p>Mexico government ignores
the problem of abandoned children, refusing to have an accurate count of total
orphans/abandoned. According to the International Children foundation an
estimate of 2 million children were left by their parents and are invisible to
the government. Many are recruited by criminal organizations, other are
captured by human trafficker and put to work on subhuman conditions and/or
prostitution. The underground traffic or organ black market also takes
advantage of the young and abandoned. </p>
<p>2) Education</p>
<p>The formal public education
in Mexico is very poor. Abandoned/orphans children have no education at all. (Sexual education) abandon kids have 20 times higher percentage of STDs than
national average creating a risk of infection for the rest of society. HIV and Hepatitis C are rampant in this demographics as well
as pregnancy at a young age. Most of the cases could be avoided by awareness
and simple prevention methods saving the government hundred thousands of
dollars by preventing the spread of this viruses to the rest of the society.
Another big problem is not enough jobs to qualified high school graduates and
that is why the entrepreneur emphasis is so important. </p>
<p>3) Lack of funding for
orphanages</p>
<p>Donations to orphanages in
Mexico are limited. Since there are not enough donations to existing
orphanages, no new orphanages are opened, leaving 98% of the abandoned/orphan
children without support. We want to fix this problem by implementing a
self-sufficient model where all the surplus of the organic farm, livestock will
be used to support the orphanage and school activities. We will also provide
workshops for urban or rural organizations interested in sustainability as an
additional source of income. The land is surrounded by a virgin jungle and a
river which provides opportunity for
ecotourism. Allowing us to operate without the need of additional donations
after the 3rd year.</p><p><span>  </span></p>
<p><b>How will the project help vulnerable
children succeed? </b></p>
<p>The Sustainable Orphanage
NGO will provide food, accommodation, legal and physiologic assistance and
leading edge education. Our
success indicator is to reach 100 percent of employability, and provide the
sustainability education necessary to students to become agents of change on
the community they choose to live at their adulthood. </p>
<p>We will implement a
revolutionary education system based on active learning from European models
and the distant learning system from New Zealand. We will put special emphasis
on entrepreneurship, aligned with conventional education. It will give a strong
foundation for those who are self-made as well as who wants to pursue a career
working as employee. Our school will have subjects such as sexual education to
prevent STD spreading and early pregnancy. We plan to have
an information technology center with high speed internet to keep them
connected and to provide a technical certification through an online university
partnership, as well as English as a second language. </p>
<p>In addition to attending
school, children will be invited to participate in different roles that sustain
the village. In this way, they will be able to choose from a diverse range of
activities like the veggie garden, farm animals, pets, fruit trees,
industrialization of farm products, carpentry, plumber, electrician,
electronics, solar heaters, chef, interior decorator, teacher, etc. Later on,
they will gain entrepreneurship skills like marketing, sales, administration,
leadership, etc. By shadowing and training with adults learning valuable
skills, they will gain the tools to help them define and reach their own goals.
</p>
<p>In our experience, there
are two other areas important to boost the potential of the kids. Performance
arts like theater, singing, dancing, etc. and sports in nature like hiking,
camping, swimming in the lake, mountain bike, fruit tree climbing, etc. Due
to the location of the orphanage being in direct contact with nature, they have
easy access to this options without generating a significant expense for the
organization. The implementation of summer camps for city kids in nature, will
help them build relationships with city kids.</p>
<p>Healthy kids: </p>
<p>Kids will be systematically
monitored to ensure their physical (size and weight), mental and emotional
health. Their nutrition will be organically produced fruit, vegetables and
animal protein ensuring they do not suffer from neither mal-nutrition nor
obesity. The kids will learn how to identify healthy vs non-healthy food and
how to balance the meals to meet their nutrition needs.</p>
<p>A graphical IT app will be
implemented to receive feedback from kids. This information will be a key input
for our Continuous Improvement program.</p>

</div>","Background:I have been a volunteer at
orphanages for more than 5 years. Seeing how orphanages crave for donations and
kids live in such limited conditions, motivated us to find a solution to solve it once
for all. We came out with a model where the orphanage can be self sufficient on
its operational expenses from year 3 onwards. We are searching for funding
for initial land down payment.  Once we have access to the land, we
can get volunteers to help us with building the infrastructure and food
production so we can take care of the kids.
Last week, one of the
orphanages I use to volunteer at, was closed and 25+ kids are in need of a
place to go.
If you could help us with a
small amount, what you spend on a hamburger or dinning out, and we get enough
hands helping us, we will be able to place the land down payment to start
this beautiful project.Project Overview:

They are intended as a how-to guide and inspiration for teachers and schools around the world to do the same.</p>
<p>At the core of the story is the digital collection of student and family-friendly content - available on the internet, but also available as a copy fitting on a Terabyte USB hard-drive. Copies can be shared equitably and distributed economically, right now, by physically transporting them to schools which do not have fast, reliable, affordable, or any internet connections.</p>
<p>We follow the story of the drives in areas where some limited number of computers are available, but internet connections are currently non-existent, slow or too expensive. We will be reporting on where we go, who we meet, what challenges we find, and how we get to the goal of making a real connection between students in different countries and cultures.</p>

<p>The collection will draw from at least three categories of content: copies of open source resources on the net; contributions from artists and musicians; and, student and teacher contributions.</p>
<p>Copies of open source information from the internet, such as a stand-alone copy of Wikipedia, can give some students access to these resources for the first time. Wikipedia and related resources fit easily into a fraction of a hard-drive.</p>
<p>Artists and musicians from Western Canada are contributing their talents in the hopes of collaborating with Jamaicans to create digital works. They are adding them as generous donations, but also for promotion, making connections and learning.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, students can add their own contributions - of projects and assignments they are proud of and would like to share. USB hard-drives and cameras circulating to and from schools give some students their first opportunity to contribute to an international conversation.</p>
<p>Teacher Dovilio Binotto has started work with his students in Calgary, Canada. He will travel to Jamaica with hard-drives and cameras to find schools to participate, meet with teachers, students, church and community leaders, and get the digital exchange started.</p>
<p>App developer, tech consultant and former teacher David Walley from Calgary, is handling the technical side of things. David's wife, teacher Tatlin Wright Walley from Port Antonio, Jamaica will be assisting with making connections and plans in Jamaica.</p>
<p>We will be reporting on the planning, execution and results of our efforts. Our primary target audience is teachers and community leaders who would like to take on a similar project.</p>
<p>Teachers will be able to get free access to the detailed journal, lesson plans and advice and experience of arranging an international digital exchange for their classrooms.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center; display: inline-block; font-size: 120%; font-weight: bold;"">What We Need</div>
<p><span style=""font-size: 125%;"">H</span>ard drives: $650. At the heart of the project are USB hard-drives. The price of compact, portable and robust 1 Terabyte drives is about $65 each, and we will start with 10.</p>
<p>Digital Cameras: $350. While many students have access to smart phone with cameras, we want to provide a few digital cameras to be shared among schools, so that all students will have an equal chance to participate.</p>
<p>Mini-studio recorders: $300. To be shared among schools and students, and also as an inviting means for musicians, church groups and story-tellers from the community to get involved.</p>
<p>Air-fare and accommodations: $2200. Two of us will be travelling from Canada to Jamaica for 2 -3 weeks, to get the project started, explain and document the process, and ensure the donated hardware is in good hands. (Lest anyone think we will be lounging on the beach, we are going when sensible Canadians enjoy their own great weather, and yes, we will visit community-maintained Winnifred beach once, just because).</p>
<p>Transportation: $500, in and around Kingston, and in the Blue Mountains.</p>
<p>Donations in kind. We will be relying on family, friends and the abundant kindness of Jamaicans to bridge the remaining gap in our finances.</p>
<p>If we can't meet our goal, we will rely on family and friends in Jamaica to supervise distribution of whatever hardware we have. Documenting the process to guide and inspire follow-on projects will be more challenging, but that will become another part of the story.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center; display: inline-block; font-size: 120%; font-weight: bold;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</div>
<p><span style=""font-size: 125%;"">O</span>ur biggest challenge is ensuring we communicate clearly and openly with everyone involved, between two countries and two cultures. Given the real possibility of misunderstandings, we will be taking care to fully explain: our goals; what schools, students and other contributors are agreeing to; and the limits of what we are able to do.</p>
<p>Another challenge is making sure that hardware does not go missing, so we will be enlisting the help of teachers, school administators and church leaders to take personal responsibility to ensure not only that the hardware is tracked, but also that it is being used effectively. We will be asking these custodians to report back to us so that we can pass along progress reports to you.</p>
<p>Ensuring participation of Jamaican teachers and students is another challenge</p>
<div style=""text-align: center; display: inline-block; font-size: 120%; font-weight: bold;"">Other Ways You Can Help</div>
<p><span style=""font-size: 125%;"">I</span>f you are an artist, musician, educator or writer, we are interested in student and family-friendly original content released under an open license.

We will be reporting on where we go, who we meet, what challenges we find, and how we get to the goal of making a real connection between students in different countries and cultures.


The collection will draw from at least three categories of content: copies of open source resources on the net; contributions from artists and musicians; and, student and teacher contributions.
Copies of open source information from the internet, such as a stand-alone copy of Wikipedia, can give some students access to these resources for the first time. Wikipedia and related resources fit easily into a fraction of a hard-drive.
Artists and musicians from Western Canada are contributing their talents in the hopes of collaborating with Jamaicans to create digital works. They are adding them as generous donations, but also for promotion, making connections and learning.
Perhaps most importantly, students can add their own contributions - of projects and assignments they are proud of and would like to share. USB hard-drives and cameras circulating to and from schools give some students their first opportunity to contribute to an international conversation.
Teacher Dovilio Binotto has started work with his students in Calgary, Canada. He will travel to Jamaica with hard-drives and cameras to find schools to participate, meet with teachers, students, church and community leaders, and get the digital exchange started.
App developer, tech consultant and former teacher David Walley from Calgary, is handling the technical side of things. David's wife, teacher Tatlin Wright Walley from Port Antonio, Jamaica will be assisting with making connections and plans in Jamaica.
We will be reporting on the planning, execution and results of our efforts. Our primary target audience is teachers and community leaders who would like to take on a similar project.
Teachers will be able to get free access to the detailed journal, lesson plans and advice and experience of arranging an international digital exchange for their classrooms.
What We Need
Hard drives: $650. At the heart of the project are USB hard-drives. The price of compact, portable and robust 1 Terabyte drives is about $65 each, and we will start with 10.
Digital Cameras: $350. While many students have access to smart phone with cameras, we want to provide a few digital cameras to be shared among schools, so that all students will have an equal chance to participate.
Mini-studio recorders: $300. To be shared among schools and students, and also as an inviting means for musicians, church groups and story-tellers from the community to get involved.
Air-fare and accommodations: $2200. Two of us will be travelling from Canada to Jamaica for 2 -3 weeks, to get the project started, explain and document the process, and ensure the donated hardware is in good hands. (Lest anyone think we will be lounging on the beach, we are going when sensible Canadians enjoy their own great weather, and yes, we will visit community-maintained Winnifred beach once, just because).
Transportation: $500, in and around Kingston, and in the Blue Mountains.
Donations in kind. We will be relying on family, friends and the abundant kindness of Jamaicans to bridge the remaining gap in our finances.
If we can't meet our goal, we will rely on family and friends in Jamaica to supervise distribution of whatever hardware we have. Documenting the process to guide and inspire follow-on projects will be more challenging, but that will become another part of the story.
Risks & Challenges
Our biggest challenge is ensuring we communicate clearly and openly with everyone involved, between two countries and two cultures. Given the real possibility of misunderstandings, we will be taking care to fully explain: our goals; what schools, students and other contributors are agreeing to; and the limits of what we are able to do.
Another challenge is making sure that hardware does not go missing, so we will be enlisting the help of teachers, school administators and church leaders to take personal responsibility to ensure not only that the hardware is tracked, but also that it is being used effectively. We will be asking these custodians to report back to us so that we can pass along progress reports to you.
Ensuring participation of Jamaican teachers and students is another challenge
Other Ways You Can Help
If you are an artist, musician, educator or writer, we are interested in student and family-friendly original content released under an open license. If you are technologically inclined, we can use your expertise to help assemble open source resources from the Internet. If you support our project, we need your help in spreading the word.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

Thank you for your help in bringing a community circus space to Buffalo!</p></div>","The Bird’s Nest is a community space dedicated to creative play, movement, and connection. Located in the heart of the growing Larkinville District of Buffalo, this facility will be the first in our region to offer classes in Circus Arts that are accessible for everyone regardless of body type, age, income, or ability. AcroYoga, aerial arts, hooping, tumbling, strength training, and dance classes will be offered to keep us active, while regular meditation and yoga classes balance your mind and satisfy your soul. In addition to classes, we will host donation-based weekly open play time in order to be truly inclusive to our community! The Bird’s Nest aims to create a safe space that promotes health through non-conventional ways of moving and collaboration.We need your help to renovate our new home for circus arts and community play in Buffalo. We need new windows,  heating, electrical, plumbing, repairs to the masonry, and so much more! We also need to purchase safety equipment like mats and soft flooring, and training equipment like aerial rigging, yoga blocks, and climbing holds. Thank you for your contribution to developing a space for our community to learn and move together!Who Are We?We are a community of folks who love circus, yoga, and Buffalo! For the last several years, we have been spreading our joy and building our community by teaching classes and hosting donation-based group play times (called jams) all over Western NY. Jams are so important to us because they allow everyone to participate and grow their skills, without having to make a monetary commitment. We teach paid classes as well, at yoga studios and gyms, but most of our classes and jams have been held outside in Delaware Park, Bidwell Park, and Canalside. We have joined with many local groups of movers, dancers, hoopers, thinkers, and players to open The Bird’s Nest. We are so excited to have a home of our own so we can offer regular classes in all kinds of movement arts for your enjoyment and have a space to play when it’s too cold to be outside. Please help us open The Bird’s Nest to create a home for circus arts in Buffalo!Help us Build Our NestThanks to a huge outpouring of support from our community, we've been able to accomplish a lot already. We took down a wall, shelving, and balcony, but there's still a lot we need. Here’s how we will use your contribution at The Bird’s Nest!The Fun Stuff:
$2,200 for five aerial set ups, including silks and rigging
$350 will get us started with some basic yoga equipment: blocks and straps are a must, but we plan to make use of donated mats, bolsters, and blankets.

$1,500 will help us build a vertical strength training area with climbing, a peg wall, pull up boards, and safety mats. We will also have a donated hangboard, parallettes, and free weights.
$500 for hula hoops
Safety Equipment:
$5,000 is needed to purchase carpet bonded foam flooring to give us a nice soft landing. This flooring can be rolled up, stored, and moved around so we can have it where we need it depending on the class or event.
$400 will get us a spotting block- a tall pad that a spotter can stand on to provide safety for standing acrobatics.
$3,200 for two 4ft deep acrobatics crash pads
$2,000 for 8in thick crash pads
$250 to stock up on first aid materials like bandages, kinesiology tape, ice packs, and a freezer to store them in.
$300 for emergency signs and lighting
$300 for permanent railings for our mezzanine 
Repairs and Construction:
$14,000 will go into replacing most of the windows in the building.
$1,500 for a structural evaluation of the building
$1,500 for heating
$3,000 for electrical
$4,000 for masonry repairs
$10,000 to level the concrete floor
The Grand Total:$50,000
Stretch GoalsThat's what we need to get the bare essentials accomplished!  Here's the cool stuff we have in mind for if we exceed our goal:
$4,200 for more anchor points for aerial rigging, and crash pads for them
$3,000 for Cyr Wheels
$3,000 for flow arts gear: poi, fans, dragon staffs, contact staffs, rope dart, etc.
$1,175 for gymnastics trapezoid
$1,500 to install carpet-bonded foam in our vertical strength training area
$9,000 to build out a second bathroom, plus installing showers
$2,000 to build out our massage studio
$8,000 to install hardwood flooring in the front of the building 
$3,000 to replace our garage doors with insulated doors
$8,000 to paint the building
$3,000 for a 2nd hand scissor lift
$450 for scissor lift certification for 3 people
$500 for handstand canes
$250 for a sound system so we can party on

<p>We are veterans with a passion for flying drones. We got together with Drone builders experts in their field and Managers that have experience in the entertainment business that showed a passion for our idea. We wanted to give access to young and old and those with disabilities. The consumer family should have live access to pre-programed drone fighters for use in live aerial combat.</p>
<p>Within a protected area with high-end Drones configured with our bubble cage Avoidance System to protect the spectators and the drones from collisions or accidents in flight.</p>
<p>The concept is to build a league with teams of drone fighter pilots competing for rankings to become the World’s Best Fighter Pilots through local, national and with international competitions held globally each year.</p>
<p>Each battle consists of six (6) pilots and lasts about 25 minutes, with 20 minutes of actual fly time in the “Combat Area”.</p>
<p>Each Drone is equipped with dual cameras for 3-D pilot viewing and navigating during combat and lasers which can tag the opponent’s drone, once a drone receives 4 deadly hits, game over, sending the drone back to its landing pad during the remainder of the battle. Professional Controllers have been designed and developed, built to give the maximum control and experience in combat competitions.</p>
<p>Each and every combat of six (6) pilots will be streamed live to screens and shown on the <a href=""http://www.ThunderDrone.cc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.ThunderDrone.cc</a> website with each pilot’s standing listed internationally on the ThunderDrone website. Replays will also be available on the YouTube.</p>
<p>Once a year the top pilots from each “Clan” will compete for cash, prizes and world-class sponsorships for their skills.</p>
<p>We need $85,000.00 to finish the bubble cage Avoidance System to complete the Prototype and prove the full system. This will be spent with existing developers of the Flight control system much of it going to university’s in Europe that have subject matter experts and our Joint Venture manufacturers in Bangkok who have supplied drones and tech to NASA and Lockheed Martin.</p>
<p>We are offering free access to live Battle Centres as they become ready around the world.  That’s free live battles as pilots of live drones, which will usually cost $45.00 per go but we are also giving away apparel Caps and T-shirts together with free banners to place on your drone when in combat.</p>
<p>As a contributor you will be automatically entered into the League which will cost others a joining fee.</p>
<p>We have picked only those that have a history of success  for both the software development and the building of our hardware together with a grounding in the entertainments market.</p>
<p>We are using real experience of combat in Battle both in flight and ground to achieve the right level of live realism with todays tech but we need to secure our hardware from real accidents so it can be reused and keep the playing field level. To do that we need our bubble cage avoidance system to be perfected in line with the current tech that we have chosen to fly the drones safely yet in a combat battle.</p>

Our coach, Mr Darren Lim brought World Scholar's Cup into Penang, Malaysia. However, we got absolutely beaten by our Singaporean neighbours on home turf during the early years (remember, Nanyang? 2014 Pwaanang Round?). Fast forward to present. In the recent Bangkok Globals of the World Scholar's Cup 2016, we won an astounding 60 gold medals and 100 silver medals for attaining the top 5% out of over 10000 scholars worldwide in academic challenges encompassing debate, writing and quiz challenges! What's even more amazing here is 20 scholars from our school successfully made it to face one final challenge for this season: the prestigious Tournament of Champions at Yale University this November (ft. legendary ukulele master 'Hand Of God, who featured in Malaysia's best talent show performance yet, as well as Aditya in Junior Debate Showcase)! This marks the first time that we have more than 20 scholars flying the Malaysian flag, resounding proof of how much progress we have made through the past three years! As a less developed country, Malaysia has not been able to accumulate funds for its scholars for the past few years, even as our academic performance on the world stage improves.

<p>My name is Brianna Newton, I am 17 years old and live in Brunswick Maine. This summer on  August 31st 2016 I was accepted into the 2017 Winter Intensive Training Program  presented by two time Olympian, Lendon Gray.  The WIT program takes place at Hampton Green Farm in Wellington, Florida from January 3rd-March 28th. This program is not for any typical dressage rider but for young riders who are devoted to being the very best rider they can be.  The days will be filled with rider fitness, theory, riding lessons from not only Lendon but with guest top riders, lectures, and field trips to other top training facilities.</p>
<p>Lendon Gray has represented the United States two times in the Olympics and was voted into the USDF Hall of Fame.  Lendon has devoted her time into promoting young riders. I have been lucky enough to participate in the Weekend Educational  Program, which is a two-day program with lessons from Lendon and educational lectures from guest speakers. I was immediately struck by Lendon’s ability to identify and correct communication break-downs between horse and rider. This experience is what inspired me to apply for the Winter Intensive program. I am one of fourteen riders selected for this opportunity. I will be taking my off the track Thoroughbred mare Justified. She is a 16 hand chestnut who has been competing successfully at training level and schooling first level .  </p>
<p>Dressage is what I love to do and something I hope will be my life and career when I’m older. I hope to someday be in a position to teach other young riders, train horses up to the highest levels in Dressage and compete internationally.</p>
<p>Riding can be a very expensive sport. While I am lucky enough to have the support of dedicated family members this trip will depend largely on fundraising. I plan to volunteer at my local dressage club when I am not competing and to create and sell items at these events to help pay for my trip. I plan to reach out to the community and apply for scholarships to help reach my financial goal. I am learning to coordinate and organize small fundraising events which have been very educational.</p>
<p>I am hoping there are those of you out there who wish to contribute to the sport in general, and through me, to young riders everywhere. My goal is to raise $15,000 through indiegogo which will be used to pay for room and board, training and living expensive down in Wellington.</p>

You will find her insights and writings to be very open, honest, and refreshing, much like a young child who discovers the <strong><i>joy of walking alone for the very first time.</i></strong> As you read through her feelings you will be able to enjoy that pleasure in your life, not merely as a spectator, but as a participant in life once again.”</p><p><strong><i>~ Exclusive Agent, Insurance Company</i></strong></p><p> </p><p>“<i><strong>Great collections</strong></i>! I am very impressed. Listiani’s book truly contains the greatest inspirations and thoughts that are <i><strong>really relevant </strong></i>to <i><strong>anyone</strong></i> in nearly <i><strong>any situation</strong></i>. I <i><strong>highly recommend </strong></i>this <i><strong>wonderful </strong></i>book to anyone.”</p><p><i><strong>~ Internetworking Engineer</strong></i></p><p> </p><p>“Listi’s poetry is indicative of her natural qualities as a person; <strong><i>graceful, worldly, optimistic, inquisitive</i></strong>, and <strong><i>wise beyond her years</i></strong>. You can tell that her writings flow easy from her heart and soul, and are relevant to us all, no matter who we are. I have always learned much from Listi regarding how we should live life, and believe that her poetry <strong><i>can speak to us all during these changing and turbulent times.</i></strong> Poets like Listi are hidden gems that can speak to our humanity, when we find them.”</p><p><i><strong>~ Researcher, Author, &amp; Supply Chain Leader​</strong></i></p><p> </p><p><strong><i>Poetry is a very personal activity.</i></strong>  It does not have to be written on paper – some of us create it while singing in the shower; others do it on the sports field; still others do it through art or crafts.  We write poetry in the living of our lives and the telling of our personal stories… </p><p>This very act of making thoughts concrete, whether they lyrically soar or simply repeat in chorus, is an act of willpower that should be respected, if not honored.  This would be a <strong><i>very different world if more of us made the effort to write out our poetry</i></strong> rather than passively experience life from in front of the TV tube.          </p><p>Listiani shares with us in this collection a bit of her soul and feelings.  … they are <strong><i>a straightforward examination of life</i></strong> as experienced by a thinking adult.  And, like all of our lives, sometimes they soar and sometimes they dip, but always they bear us along in her song.</p><p><strong><i>~ Senior Director</i></strong></p><p> </p><p>“Listiani’s work touches on thoughts and feelings common to everyone around the world. Perhaps by focusing more on these issues there could be <strong><i>greater peace</i></strong> for us all.”</p><p><strong><i>~ Director, International Alumni Relations</i></strong></p><p> </p><p>“The poems in this book were written about <strong><i>everyday experiences</i></strong>, about everyday life by a person who understands intimately the everydayness of <strong><i>two cultures</i></strong>. She beautifully and thoughtfully shows us that we are all, indeed, one; that life is beautiful and sad also awe inspiring to all peoples in the same way, no matter what your cultural background. “</p><p><strong><i>~ Director, Relocation Services, Real Estate Company, Realtor, Gardener, and Painter</i></strong></p><p> </p><p>Listiani’s poems are very thought provoking and are filled with passion. Very nice and I am really amazed with her talents!” “</p><p><strong><i>~ Marketing Coordinator, Foreign Trade Institute</i></strong></p><p> </p><p>“Listiani was one of my students in the business school. She came to class each day and participated with the best of them. It is only now that I realize what other <strong><i>talents </i></strong>and <strong><i>insights </i></strong>she possessed, and how blind I was to not know they were there all the time.”</p><p><strong><i>~ Clinical Professor, Information Technology and Electronic Commerce and Director, Center for the Study of Electronic Commerce</i></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>True, Passionate Learners</strong></p><p>To many who have never taught, the art of teaching appears to be a one-way proposition from teacher to student.  In reality, the best learning experiences are those where a <strong><i>two-way flow</i></strong> of <strong><i>understanding emerges</i></strong> and the <strong><i>joy of discovery is shared equally</i></strong>.  The ones who make such a shared experience possible are students who eagerly seek out knowledge, who think about what they do not know, and move to complete their own personal picture of the world and its wonders… </p><p>            Listiani is one of these few.  I came to know her determination as her teacher while at the Business School.  Idle or passing comments about this or that would engage the imagination of the class for a few moments, except for Listi who would come to the next session with articles and materials she had collected because of her <strong><i>curiosity and drive</i></strong>...</p><p>Now I have read her poetry.  From it I can see what she sees: <strong>the beauty in all things</strong>, the big, the small, the everyday, and the unimaginable.</p><p>            <strong><i>True, passionate learners</i></strong> never stop pushing themselves to discover the wisdoms around them and see art and poetry in all things.  After a while, they understand that the compartments of knowledge are arbitrary and artificial.  From such a perspective, one can readily see that what we call <strong><i>music</i></strong>, <strong><i>mathematics</i></strong>, <strong><i>science</i></strong>, <strong><i>art</i></strong>, <strong><i>philosophy</i></strong>, <strong><i>history</i></strong>, and so on are <strong><i>one and the same</i></strong>.  It is <strong><i>from this</i></strong> <strong><i>perspective</i></strong> that <strong><i>her poetry</i></strong> <strong><i>should be viewed</i></strong> and <strong><i>enjoyed</i></strong>.</p><p><strong><i>~ Consultant and Lecturer</i></strong></p><p> </p><p>“Listiani is a <strong><i>woman at peace</i></strong>. She has a <strong><i>serene view</i></strong> of the <strong><i>world</i></strong>; one that <strong><i>many of us could benefit from</i></strong>. Her poetry reflects the <strong><i>realities</i></strong> as well as the <strong><i>opportunities</i></strong> in our lives and allows us time to reflect on her message.”</p><p><strong><i>~ Former Administrative Director, Gardener, Cyclist, and Conversationalist</i></strong></p><p> </p><p>“Her poetry is a reflection of her <strong><i>intelligence, wisdom, and understanding</i></strong>. I am always thrilled to read her new poem. I believe you will enjoy and learn a lot from reading her writings.”</p><p><strong><i>~ Head of Institutional Sales &amp; Development, Insurance Company</i></strong></p><p> </p><p>“In Listiani’s poems, she illustrates the <strong><i>value of a life</i></strong> and the <strong><i>opportunity each life brings</i></strong>. She carries hope and optimism in an uncertain time. The poems show recognition of beauty within herself, in others, and in the world around her. “</p><p><strong><i>~ ""Owner and Artist"" of Sandesigns</i></strong></p><p> </p><p>“Listiani has written <strong><i>a most definitely lovely book</i></strong>.

You will find her insights and writings to be very open, honest, and refreshing, much like a young child who discovers the joy of walking alone for the very first time. As you read through her feelings you will be able to enjoy that pleasure in your life, not merely as a spectator, but as a participant in life once again.”~ Exclusive Agent, Insurance Company “Great collections! I am very impressed. Listiani’s book truly contains the greatest inspirations and thoughts that are really relevant to anyone in nearly any situation. I highly recommend this wonderful book to anyone.”~ Internetworking Engineer “Listi’s poetry is indicative of her natural qualities as a person; graceful, worldly, optimistic, inquisitive, and wise beyond her years. You can tell that her writings flow easy from her heart and soul, and are relevant to us all, no matter who we are. I have always learned much from Listi regarding how we should live life, and believe that her poetry can speak to us all during these changing and turbulent times. Poets like Listi are hidden gems that can speak to our humanity, when we find them.”~ Researcher, Author, & Supply Chain Leader​ Poetry is a very personal activity.  It does not have to be written on paper – some of us create it while singing in the shower; others do it on the sports field; still others do it through art or crafts.  We write poetry in the living of our lives and the telling of our personal stories… This very act of making thoughts concrete, whether they lyrically soar or simply repeat in chorus, is an act of willpower that should be respected, if not honored.  This would be a very different world if more of us made the effort to write out our poetry rather than passively experience life from in front of the TV tube.          Listiani shares with us in this collection a bit of her soul and feelings.  … they are a straightforward examination of life as experienced by a thinking adult.  And, like all of our lives, sometimes they soar and sometimes they dip, but always they bear us along in her song.~ Senior Director “Listiani’s work touches on thoughts and feelings common to everyone around the world. Perhaps by focusing more on these issues there could be greater peace for us all.”~ Director, International Alumni Relations “The poems in this book were written about everyday experiences, about everyday life by a person who understands intimately the everydayness of two cultures. She beautifully and thoughtfully shows us that we are all, indeed, one; that life is beautiful and sad also awe inspiring to all peoples in the same way, no matter what your cultural background. “~ Director, Relocation Services, Real Estate Company, Realtor, Gardener, and Painter Listiani’s poems are very thought provoking and are filled with passion. Very nice and I am really amazed with her talents!” “~ Marketing Coordinator, Foreign Trade Institute “Listiani was one of my students in the business school. She came to class each day and participated with the best of them. It is only now that I realize what other talents and insights she possessed, and how blind I was to not know they were there all the time.”~ Clinical Professor, Information Technology and Electronic Commerce and Director, Center for the Study of Electronic Commerce True, Passionate LearnersTo many who have never taught, the art of teaching appears to be a one-way proposition from teacher to student.  In reality, the best learning experiences are those where a two-way flow of understanding emerges and the joy of discovery is shared equally.  The ones who make such a shared experience possible are students who eagerly seek out knowledge, who think about what they do not know, and move to complete their own personal picture of the world and its wonders…             Listiani is one of these few.  I came to know her determination as her teacher while at the Business School.  Idle or passing comments about this or that would engage the imagination of the class for a few moments, except for Listi who would come to the next session with articles and materials she had collected because of her curiosity and drive...Now I have read her poetry.  From it I can see what she sees: the beauty in all things, the big, the small, the everyday, and the unimaginable.            True, passionate learners never stop pushing themselves to discover the wisdoms around them and see art and poetry in all things.  After a while, they understand that the compartments of knowledge are arbitrary and artificial.  From such a perspective, one can readily see that what we call music, mathematics, science, art, philosophy, history, and so on are one and the same.  It is from this perspective that her poetry should be viewed and enjoyed.~ Consultant and Lecturer “Listiani is a woman at peace. She has a serene view of the world; one that many of us could benefit from. Her poetry reflects the realities as well as the opportunities in our lives and allows us time to reflect on her message.”~ Former Administrative Director, Gardener, Cyclist, and Conversationalist “Her poetry is a reflection of her intelligence, wisdom, and understanding. I am always thrilled to read her new poem. I believe you will enjoy and learn a lot from reading her writings.”~ Head of Institutional Sales & Development, Insurance Company “In Listiani’s poems, she illustrates the value of a life and the opportunity each life brings. She carries hope and optimism in an uncertain time. The poems show recognition of beauty within herself, in others, and in the world around her. “~ ""Owner and Artist"" of Sandesigns “Listiani has written a most definitely lovely book. I carry it in my briefcase to work, and read it often during breaks and over lunch, even while I am waiting at a traffic light.

</h3>
<div><span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px;""><br/></span></div>
<p><b>Our Purpose</b></p>
<p>Sadly, <b>this was not the first death at this location.</b>  Due to <b>constraints
on funding, signage does not warn of the extreme danger </b>lurking there and
there are no lifeguards assigned to that beach. In Jamie’s memory her family
has committed to do all we can to ensure that others do not lose their lives at
Lumahai and adjacent remote beaches on the North Shore of Kauai. </p>
<p>Funds raised by this campaign would be used by the County of Kauai to create
and install prominent warning signs using Google Earth color photos to describe
the hazards associated with rip currents and rogue waves at a particular
location. Additionally, these signs would provide important lifesaving
information. If sufficient funds are raised, the County of Kauai would create a
roving lifeguard program, which, according to the County of Kauai Ocean Safety
Division, would be the most feasible, expedient safety improvement plan
considering the current fiscal climate.</p>
<p>Under the roving lifeguard program, a staffed lifeguard vehicle would rove unguarded
beaches during times of the year when seasonal ocean conditions dictate that
accidents are more prone to occur at those locations. Having a full-time roving
lifeguard vehicle, complete with lifesaving equipment, a jet ski, an ATV, etc.
would prevent many drownings at unprotected beaches, including Lumahai. A
roving lifeguard program, already in place on the island of Oahu for the last several
years, has proven to be an extremely valuable addition to existing stationery
lifeguard towers. In fact, had a roving lifeguard program been in place for Lumahai
and adjacent beaches prior to October 12<sup>th</sup>, perhaps Jamie’s tragic
drowning could have been averted.</p>
<p>Additional contributions would be used to provide seed money to the <a href=""http://kauailifeguards.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Kauai Lifeguards Association</b></a>
(KLA),a 501(c)(3)
charitable organization working to<b> make Hawaii’s waters safe</b>, to establish a “Jamie’s Heroes” award
program that would honor monthly a professional lifeguard, surfer, or beachgoer
who saves a person from drowning. In conjunction with each award there will be a
widespread electronic and print media campaign with the express goal of
educating island residents and visitors about ocean safety awareness. Additionally,
all awardees would be honored at the annual KLA Ocean Safety Campaign event,
which also would be widely publicized. Any additional monies raised that exceed
our stated goal would be used to help <b>fund a nonprofit foundation that would further Jamie’s vision of promoting mindfulness and service to those in need, </b>both
domestically and around the world.</p>
<p><b>The Safety Project</b></p>
<p>Kauai ocean safety officials have provided the following estimated budget
items for signage and the roving lifeguard program: </p>
<p>Signage<b>  </b>10,000</p>
<p>Roving Lifeguard Vehicle  $45,000</p>
<p>Rescue Jet Ski and Trailer  $24,000</p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Ocean Safety Awareness Project  </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">$25,000</span><br/></p>
<p><b>TOTAL  $125,000</b></p>
<p><b>Continuing the Commitment to Serve</b></p>
<p>Jamie dedicated her life to helping people. The campaign to improve safety
and avoid other deaths at this beautiful but lethal site and other remote
beaches honors Jamie’s beliefs that every life matters and every act of service
has a ripple effect.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Jamie's Work</b></p>
<p>Jamie was a medical
doctor and reporter for ABC’s Medical Unit who dedicated her life to helping
people in need. She was published in many media outlets, including the
Huffington Post, PBS, MindBodyGreen, Sonima, and Yahoo News. Recently she gave
a poignant talk entitled “The Power of the Gap” at TEDx Bushwick 2015. Among
the service she performed, Jamie helped Congolese refugees in Zambia,
volunteered in a hospital in India, and built classrooms in Uganda. She also
worked with indigenous people on the Amazon River in Peru and served as a
United Nations Global Health representative in Haiti.</p>
<p><b><a href=""http://www.jamiezmd.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Passionate
about teaching mindfulness and helping people lead purpose-driven lives,</a> </b>Jamie lectured widely on the<b> intersection between medicine
and meditation. </b>She worked with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFP5JpF9Tik&amp;list=PL7QaOcpbJak0kAISs8WvBw0jyLGJBUqMd"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Deepak
Chopra </a>and led meditation
sessions for her colleagues at <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/video/remembering-dr-jamie-zimmerman-loved-people-34534604"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ABC
News</a>, Congressional staff on
Capitol Hill in DC, and hundreds of others. Jamie also worked with The (Goldie)
Hawn Foundation, training educators and school administrators to teach
meditation to children. </p>
<p><b>Jamie's Legacy</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Jamie connected people
with themselves and with each other. She studied the medical basis for
mindfulness’ effectiveness and how meditation rewires the brain, using that
knowledge as a tool that not only heals the individual, but also enables people to help
others.</b></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAMvU3VlXHo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">She
would tell us to</a> <b>STOP: S</b>top,
<b>T</b>ake deep breaths,<b> O</b>bserve our emotions, and <b>P</b>roceed in a
way that supports our highest intentions. </p>
<p>Jamie believed that
for every crisis in our lives there is both the danger of falling into
emotional reactivity and also the opportunity to pause, get in the gap, and
choose our highest response. She saw every crisis as an opportunity,
“crisi-tunity,"" as she called it.   <b>Jamie seized every opportunity
to help others, from her work in global health to her passion for teaching
mindfulness. Her expansive heart and
expansive dreams energized us to be our best selves. We sincerely hope
that Jamie’s life will inspire you to take action now to make the world a more open,
safe, healthy, and loving place.  </b></p>

lifeguard towers. In fact, had a roving lifeguard program been in place for Lumahai
and adjacent beaches prior to October 12th, perhaps Jamie’s tragic
drowning could have been averted.
Additional contributions would be used to provide seed money to the Kauai Lifeguards Association
(KLA),a 501(c)(3)
charitable organization working to make Hawaii’s waters safe, to establish a “Jamie’s Heroes” award
program that would honor monthly a professional lifeguard, surfer, or beachgoer
who saves a person from drowning. In conjunction with each award there will be a
widespread electronic and print media campaign with the express goal of
educating island residents and visitors about ocean safety awareness. Additionally,
all awardees would be honored at the annual KLA Ocean Safety Campaign event,
which also would be widely publicized. Any additional monies raised that exceed
our stated goal would be used to help fund a nonprofit foundation that would further Jamie’s vision of promoting mindfulness and service to those in need, both
domestically and around the world.
The Safety Project
Kauai ocean safety officials have provided the following estimated budget
items for signage and the roving lifeguard program: 
Signage  10,000
Roving Lifeguard Vehicle  $45,000
Rescue Jet Ski and Trailer  $24,000
Response ATV  $10,000
Binoculars, Bullhorn, and Related Supplies 
$5,000
Radio Equipment  $1,000
Vehicle Fuel and Maintenance  $5,000
The Ocean Safety Awareness Project  $25,000
TOTAL  $125,000
Continuing the Commitment to Serve
Jamie dedicated her life to helping people. The campaign to improve safety
and avoid other deaths at this beautiful but lethal site and other remote
beaches honors Jamie’s beliefs that every life matters and every act of service
has a ripple effect.

Jamie's Work
Jamie was a medical
doctor and reporter for ABC’s Medical Unit who dedicated her life to helping
people in need. She was published in many media outlets, including the
Huffington Post, PBS, MindBodyGreen, Sonima, and Yahoo News. Recently she gave
a poignant talk entitled “The Power of the Gap” at TEDx Bushwick 2015. Among
the service she performed, Jamie helped Congolese refugees in Zambia,
volunteered in a hospital in India, and built classrooms in Uganda. She also
worked with indigenous people on the Amazon River in Peru and served as a
United Nations Global Health representative in Haiti.
Passionate
about teaching mindfulness and helping people lead purpose-driven lives, Jamie lectured widely on the intersection between medicine
and meditation. She worked with Deepak
Chopra and led meditation
sessions for her colleagues at ABC
News, Congressional staff on
Capitol Hill in DC, and hundreds of others. Jamie also worked with The (Goldie)
Hawn Foundation, training educators and school administrators to teach
meditation to children. 
Jamie's Legacy

Jamie connected people
with themselves and with each other. She studied the medical basis for
mindfulness’ effectiveness and how meditation rewires the brain, using that
knowledge as a tool that not only heals the individual, but also enables people to help
others.
She
would tell us to STOP: Stop,
Take deep breaths, Observe our emotions, and Proceed in a
way that supports our highest intentions. 
Jamie believed that
for every crisis in our lives there is both the danger of falling into
emotional reactivity and also the opportunity to pause, get in the gap, and
choose our highest response. She saw every crisis as an opportunity,
“crisi-tunity,"" as she called it.   Jamie seized every opportunity
to help others, from her work in global health to her passion for teaching
mindfulness. Her expansive heart and
expansive dreams energized us to be our best selves. We sincerely hope
that Jamie’s life will inspire you to take action now to make the world a more open,
safe, healthy, and loving place.

<p><b>Scautismo aperto a tutti?</b></p>
<p>Tra i nostri ragazzi ci sono famiglie in difficoltà, per le quali un'uscita, uno zaino, un'uniforme sono spese spesso proibitive. Ma lo scautismo aperto a tutti non può fermarsi di fronte a questi limiti.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458505717/j609x6nmxgjpxbjccfke.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Un maglione costa circa 40 euro, una camicia circa 25, uno zaino intorno ai 100, spese indispensabili per 'essere scout' che possono diventare un'ostacolo.</p>
<p>Il tuo aiuto andrà a sostenere il fondo che la nostra Sezione stanzia ogni anno (da 25 anni) per le famiglie in difficoltà, un fondo ormai spesso insufficiente in questi tempi di crisi.</p>
<p><b>Vita all'aria aperta?</b></p>
<p>Uno dei nostri strumenti fondamentali per far vivere l'avventura ai nostri ragazzi, ma quando piove?</p>
<p></p>

<p>Altre sono adatte ma costose, tra affitti, acqua e manutenzione, spendiamo ogni anno circa 8.000 euro, spese che oggi sono difficili da sostenere per un'associazione basata sul volontariato puro.</p>
<p><b>Tutto col gioco, nulla per gioco.</b></p>
<p>I ragazzi e le ragazze che prestano volontariamente servizio nella nostra associazione partecipano ad un percorso di formazione.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Questo percorso dura due anni, prevede spostamenti, campi scuola, formatori.</p>
<p>I nostri capi imparano così, con l'impegno e la costanza a scrivere una programmazione educativa, a scegliere tra gli strumenti che lo scautismo offre, il più adatto per i bisogni dei vostri ragazzi, a capire l'importanza del loro lavoro e l'impatto di ogni singolo momento, nella crescita dei ragazzi.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In questa formazione noi crediamo profondamente, perché è la differenza tra 'far giocare i ragazzi' o 'crescere gli uomini e le donne di domani'.</p>
<p>Formare un capo costa circa 1000 euro e i nostri ragazzi sono spesso studenti o giovani lavoratori e faticano ad affrontare questa spesa, fatichiamo a sostenere queste spese, ma non vorremmo mai rinunciarvi.</p>
<p>Il tuo aiuto potrebbe aiutarci a sostenere uno scautismo sempre di qualità.</p>
<p><br/></p>

A Gassino, Chivasso e San Mauro facciamo scautismo da oltre 25 anni.
Il nostro impegno quotidiano a fianco dei vostri ragazzi per costruire insieme una cittadinanza migliore: attiva, consapevole e responsabile, si scontra spesso con la carenza di supporto da parte delle istituzioni.




Abbiamo bisogno di voi, del vostro aiuto, di una vostra 'moneta' perché siamo convinti che il cambiamento parta dai piccoli gesti: i momenti vissuti, le esperienze condivise, le scelte fatte, diventando grandi giorno dopo giorno imparando la democrazia, la differenza, il rispetto e la bellezza dell'incontro.
   Perché una 'moneta'? Ti raccontiamo come il tuo contributo possa realmente cambiare le cose:
Scautismo aperto a tutti?
Tra i nostri ragazzi ci sono famiglie in difficoltà, per le quali un'uscita, uno zaino, un'uniforme sono spese spesso proibitive. Ma lo scautismo aperto a tutti non può fermarsi di fronte a questi limiti.


Un maglione costa circa 40 euro, una camicia circa 25, uno zaino intorno ai 100, spese indispensabili per 'essere scout' che possono diventare un'ostacolo.
Il tuo aiuto andrà a sostenere il fondo che la nostra Sezione stanzia ogni anno (da 25 anni) per le famiglie in difficoltà, un fondo ormai spesso insufficiente in questi tempi di crisi.
Vita all'aria aperta?
Uno dei nostri strumenti fondamentali per far vivere l'avventura ai nostri ragazzi, ma quando piove?

Alcune delle nostre sedi sono insufficienti ad accogliere il numero sempre crescente di ragazzi che si avvicinano a questa grande avventura, andrebbero sostituite o potenziate.
Altre sono adatte ma costose, tra affitti, acqua e manutenzione, spendiamo ogni anno circa 8.000 euro, spese che oggi sono difficili da sostenere per un'associazione basata sul volontariato puro.
Tutto col gioco, nulla per gioco.
I ragazzi e le ragazze che prestano volontariamente servizio nella nostra associazione partecipano ad un percorso di formazione.


Questo percorso dura due anni, prevede spostamenti, campi scuola, formatori.
I nostri capi imparano così, con l'impegno e la costanza a scrivere una programmazione educativa, a scegliere tra gli strumenti che lo scautismo offre, il più adatto per i bisogni dei vostri ragazzi, a capire l'importanza del loro lavoro e l'impatto di ogni singolo momento, nella crescita dei ragazzi.





In questa formazione noi crediamo profondamente, perché è la differenza tra 'far giocare i ragazzi' o 'crescere gli uomini e le donne di domani'.
Formare un capo costa circa 1000 euro e i nostri ragazzi sono spesso studenti o giovani lavoratori e faticano ad affrontare questa spesa, fatichiamo a sostenere queste spese, ma non vorremmo mai rinunciarvi.
Il tuo aiuto potrebbe aiutarci a sostenere uno scautismo sempre di qualità.

In cambio del tuo aiuto abbiamo pensato di lasciarti un pensiero, un ringraziamento che puoi visualizzare sulla destra. E' un pensiero carico di significato, perché mai come nello scautismo i simboli contano!



    
Ci sono tanti modi per aiutarci.
Le monete non sono l'unico modo per sostenerci, se non puoi fare una donazione, non significa che tu non possa aiutarci, anzi.Lo scautismo è fatto di persone e per le persone, il tuo aiuto può essere fondamentale.Se hai voglia di metterti in gioco, abbiamo bisogno di te:

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>We're two military spouses and moms who have a passion for building stronger families. Like most military families, ours have already endured more short and long-term separations than we can count, and we personally know dozens of other parents and kids trying to work through the challenges of living apart. We have the first comprehensive product for children ages 4-7 that targets the biggest troubles of separation: a subscription box filled with handpicked tools and toys for kids and their caretakers. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As of 2014, <a href=""https://www.research.va.gov/currents/winter2013-14/winter2013-14-28.cfm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">1.4 million US children had a parent in the military, and about half of US service members had a child under the age of 18</a>. A military life inevitably involves periods in which parents have to work away from home and separate from their children. Rarely do parents feel prepared for the emotional and behavioral impact on their children, causing additional stress, worry, and tension in an already difficult time.</p>

Due to Turkish Lira’s recent significant loss of value against Euro, I can no longer support my studies with family funds alone. So, I ask you for your help to gather the funds required by the Austrian Embassy to grant me a student visa - 10,000 Euros for one year - by the end of September. Please donate, no matter how small, as every bit helps. Thank you very much in advance!If you donate me more than 100 Euros, I can give you some guitar lessons or a little concert on Skype.Ebru BeşShe started her guitar adventure with  Hamit Elmas in 2010; he continued with Atahan Kaya in Akdeniz University Fine Arts Faculty Department of Music.

Burs başvurularında bulundum ancak hala sonuçlanmasını bekliyorum. Bir aylık ihtiyacım ortalama 700 Euro civarında olacak.Eğer bana 100 Euro'dan fazla bağış yaparsanız, Skype'tan size küçük bir dinleti yapabilir ya da gitar dersi verebilirim.Şimdiden teşekkürler!Ebru BeşGitar çalışmalarına 2010 yılında Hamit Elmas ile başladı.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Elden Chase Kimball. We are launching a new online portal website named ChronicleQuest.com. This is a continuation of the work my father, Glenn Kimball, and I did for many years in the fields of archaeology, science, history and cultures. Together, we amassed a sizable media library. Glenn passed away in 2010 and I suspended our work until which time I had the team, funds and technology in place to relaunch. That time is now...</p>
<p>Now we have a team in place for transforming our previous work (and our new and upcoming work and collaborations with other scholars) into many technological formats including audio, video, virtual and augmented reality, animation, etc. By using these technologies, we are making the world of history and discovery exciting and fun, not just for adults, but for the youth of today as well!</p>
<p>We have the ability to provide all of this information right now. However, we created this campaign in order to have the funds to work and create in these new media formats to provide the maximum experience for our members.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>There are many different ways for us to get our information out to people. In order to create the best experience, we feel we should tackle as many of them as possible. Our goal is to have the funds necessary to provide a 1st-person augmented and virtual experience for the consumer, where they can go visit different sites around the world without leaving their home. While we are developing the first destinations, we will be continuing to provide new research, audio books, videos and more for our members. People can visit our website and browse through many intriguing topics. As time goes on, the website becomes more and more populated with fascinating material from around the world.</p>
<p>Running this new website (ChronicleQuest.com) has expenses, but also has a subscription model that will help fund future projects. Creating the 1st-person augmented and virtual experiences has many expenses, but will also launch us into having the capability to provide more and more adventures.</p>
<p>In order to get from where we are today (a functioning website with a vast media library of content) to rolling out our first 1st-person augmented and virtual experience we need the following funding:</p>
<p>$13,000 - Website Upkeep and Development</p>
<p>$9,000 - Advertising/Social Media</p>
<p>$20,000 - Audio/Video Production</p>
<p>$8,000 - Research/Writing/Travel</p>
<p>$6,000 - Light Administration Costs</p>
<p>$40,000 - 1st Person Experience Production Costs </p>
<p>$96,000 - Total Funding Needed</p>
<p>In the event that this campaign does not meet the goal of $96,000 the money will be used as follows:</p>
<p>25% - Audio/Video Production</p>
<p>25% - 1st Person Experience Production Costs</p>
<p>25% - Website Upkeep and Development and Advertising/Social Media</p>
<p>25% - Research/Writing/Travel and Light Administration Costs</p>
<p>In the event that the campaign exceeds the goal of $96,000. the money will be dispersed into each category as it was allocated. The excess money will be dispersed as follows:</p>
<p>25% - Audio/Video Production</p>
<p>25% - 1st Person Experience Production Costs</p>
<p>25% - Website Upkeep and Development and Advertising/Social Media</p>
<p>25% - Research/Writing/Travel and Light Administration Costs</p>
<p>Each campaign offers perks for donating. Our perks will include different memberships and free 1-hour long audio books (of which we have 147 titles, all researched, written and produced by me and my father and our production team).</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We aren't just relaunching some company. My father and I always had a passion for helping people understand various important subjects. We believed that you must keep all the pieces of the puzzle on the table, no matter how much they don't seem to fit, in order to get closer to the truth.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons for launching this, is because the kids and young adults of today have so much information at their fingertips and most are wasting the opportunity to grow their knowledge and understanding. I see all these kids spending all day watching meaningless videos on YouTube, or other sites, when there is a vast amount of information out there that would be so much more beneficial! The problem is that there is so much out there and it is almost impossible for them to put it together in a way that makes sense. This pertains to the adults too, not just the kids. That is why we have the different sections on our site, so you can research, or learn and be entertained on any level that is right for you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Any new business faces different risks and challenges. Our team has countless years of experience in research, writing, production, animation, etc. This experience allows us to overcome many obstacles that might arise throughout the beginning stages of this business. The main challenge that I see, would be not raising enough money to get the 1st-person augmented and virtual experience up and running soon enough. We will get there, no matter what, eventually. However, by getting enough funding, we will get there quickly and everyone will have a lot of fun once it goes live.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you cannot contribute financially, there are some ways you can help with our campaign.</p>
<p>If you can tell someone about us, or share a link to our website, or this campaign, that would be extremely helpful. If you have certain technological, or research skills that might help us with the new materials and/or productions, that would be extremely helpful. </p>
<p>Remember that you can use the Indiegogo share tools on this site.</p>

While we are developing the first destinations, we will be continuing to provide new research, audio books, videos and more for our members. People can visit our website and browse through many intriguing topics. As time goes on, the website becomes more and more populated with fascinating material from around the world.
Running this new website (ChronicleQuest.com) has expenses, but also has a subscription model that will help fund future projects. Creating the 1st-person augmented and virtual experiences has many expenses, but will also launch us into having the capability to provide more and more adventures.
In order to get from where we are today (a functioning website with a vast media library of content) to rolling out our first 1st-person augmented and virtual experience we need the following funding:
$13,000 - Website Upkeep and Development
$9,000 - Advertising/Social Media
$20,000 - Audio/Video Production
$8,000 - Research/Writing/Travel
$6,000 - Light Administration Costs
$40,000 - 1st Person Experience Production Costs 
$96,000 - Total Funding Needed
In the event that this campaign does not meet the goal of $96,000 the money will be used as follows:
25% - Audio/Video Production
25% - 1st Person Experience Production Costs
25% - Website Upkeep and Development and Advertising/Social Media
25% - Research/Writing/Travel and Light Administration Costs
In the event that the campaign exceeds the goal of $96,000. the money will be dispersed into each category as it was allocated. The excess money will be dispersed as follows:
25% - Audio/Video Production
25% - 1st Person Experience Production Costs
25% - Website Upkeep and Development and Advertising/Social Media
25% - Research/Writing/Travel and Light Administration Costs
Each campaign offers perks for donating. Our perks will include different memberships and free 1-hour long audio books (of which we have 147 titles, all researched, written and produced by me and my father and our production team).

The Impact
We aren't just relaunching some company. My father and I always had a passion for helping people understand various important subjects. We believed that you must keep all the pieces of the puzzle on the table, no matter how much they don't seem to fit, in order to get closer to the truth.
One of the main reasons for launching this, is because the kids and young adults of today have so much information at their fingertips and most are wasting the opportunity to grow their knowledge and understanding. I see all these kids spending all day watching meaningless videos on YouTube, or other sites, when there is a vast amount of information out there that would be so much more beneficial! The problem is that there is so much out there and it is almost impossible for them to put it together in a way that makes sense. This pertains to the adults too, not just the kids. That is why we have the different sections on our site, so you can research, or learn and be entertained on any level that is right for you.

Risks & Challenges
Any new business faces different risks and challenges. Our team has countless years of experience in research, writing, production, animation, etc. This experience allows us to overcome many obstacles that might arise throughout the beginning stages of this business. The main challenge that I see, would be not raising enough money to get the 1st-person augmented and virtual experience up and running soon enough. We will get there, no matter what, eventually. However, by getting enough funding, we will get there quickly and everyone will have a lot of fun once it goes live.

Other Ways You Can Help
Even if you cannot contribute financially, there are some ways you can help with our campaign.
If you can tell someone about us, or share a link to our website, or this campaign, that would be extremely helpful. If you have certain technological, or research skills that might help us with the new materials and/or productions, that would be extremely helpful.

It does not matter if it is much or little, it all adds up. If you want to know more about the festival click here (www.miprimerfestival.net) and thank you for being part of this festival!_______________________________​Mi Primer Festival siembra en los niños el amor por el cine y quiere seguir sembrando. Es, de verdad, el primer festival de cine para niños en el Perú que incluye una delicada curaduría de audiovisuales infantiles, talleres, clases maestras, conciertos, jurado de niños y muchas cosas más. Se ha realizado dos ediciones anteriores en 14 sedes en Lima y provincias y este año lanzamos la tercera edición a finales de enero. Para eso necesitamos tu ayuda. Durante estos años hemos alcanzado resultados sorprendentes (los primeros sorprendidos hemos sido nosotros! ver los resultados abajo). Lo hemos logrado gracias a tener el premio del concurso nacional para la formación cinematográfica del Ministerio de Cultura, con auspicios y sobre todo con el empuje de todo el equipo de Dirección, Diseño y Producción del festival. Todos ellos hacen que este festival sea posible aportando su profesionalismo, tiempo, y recursos. Este año no tenemos los fondos del concurso y los auspicios han sido limitados. Por eso hemos lanzado esta campaña para que todas las personas que aman el cine, los niños y quieren que este festival siga igual de vivo y especial que antes nos ayude a cubrir algunos gastos básicos. No importa si es mucho o poco, todo suma. Con el dinero recaudado pagaremos los derechos de las películas, la imprenta, el transporte, anuncios en redes sociales y prensa. Para tener contenido de calidad debemos pagar por los derechos y este año queremos llevaremos el festival a 6 distritos: Barranco, Comas, Los Olivos, Miraflores y San Isidro. Tener un festival descentralizado hace que los gastos en transporte son elevados. También debemos dar a conocer el festival para eso necesitamos afiches y programas impresos además de anuncios en redes. Y eso será todo. Para saber más del festival entra a (www.miprimerfestival.net). Muchas gracias por ser parte de este festival!________________________________ Results Previous Years:• More than 9,000 attendees• More than 40 Audiovisual and artistic training workshops• More than 1,700 participants in audiovisual and artistic training workshops• 14 venues all over the country• More than 90 short and long films• 8 Concerts",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>A Little Bit of Our History</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.learninglittlepeople.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Learning Little People, LLC</a> began April 15, 2013 with a focus on training teachers and school administrators in Alabama. Later, we added tutoring and enrichment services to our business model because we observed, first hand, the stark disparities in academic success for minority and less fortunate students, as well as students with mild to moderate disabilities. Our focus continues to be on learning, rather than schooling, and the LLP team understands the difference between the two.</p>

Everybody Gets To Eat, and Norwegian Couture has joined to uproot children of Cambodia from inhumane conditions of poverty through education.  Norwegian Couture has committed his BRAND to support Everybody Gets To Eat in building computer schools to teach children modern learning skills that gives a child hope and vision of a bright future.  Join us in this mission to help where it's most needed and change these innocent little lives through education.  We need your single act of kindness.
Imagine having no hope of an education then suddenly you can attend a school supplied with computers for automated learning.  Vision a computer in these children hands.....

Basic education is viewed worldwide as a human right and should not be denied to anyone who wants it.  Our original goal was building ten schools, but we decided to run our campaign with a small challenge only asking for your help to build two digital schools at $10,000 Each.  
You can help a child escape inhumane conditions of poverty by donating to support building digital schools equipped with teachers trained in lesson plans that surpass Cambodia public school curriculum.  Your contributions are not wasted.  Also, you Create Jobs by hiring local labor for school construction.  Carpenters can increase production from farming after raining season using money earn from building schools.

<h3>The Origin Story of the AC Trump Museum Project</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Levi Fox and I'm an Atlantic City Historian, Tour Guide, and Adjunct Professor. I'm also a part of the Trump Museum Committee, which hopes to soon bring an exhibit to AC. When giving a post-election 'Trump's Gambling Heritage Tour' for my company, Jersey Shore Tours, I hit upon the idea that a Trump themed museum exhibit could help to benefit local tourism. After reaching out to colleagues, we began looking for artifacts and stories from Trump casinos, and we are now seeking funding to pay for the foundation of a non-profit group to manage the project and the costs of storing artifacts prior to an exhibit.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How You Can Help and Why You Might Want To</h3>
<p>We are currently looking for $2000 to cover the costs associated with creating a non-profit entity to manage the project and the fees to store artifacts prior to an exhibit. Roughly $1500 will go to pay for the legal advice and the registration of documents needed to formally create a Trump Museum Organization, which will make it easier to raise additional funding for the future via partnerships and grants. The remaining roughly $500 will pay for storing artifacts in a place where they can be cataloged and safely remain until an exhibit or permanent archive is created.​ We will continue fundraising efforts whether or not we reach this short term goal of $2000, since the project will require more funding for a temporary exhibit or permanent display to succeed. This is only our first fundraising effort!</p>
<p>Silver level contributors of $5 or more will be recognized on the project website:  <a href=""http://www.TrumpMuseum.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.TrumpMuseum.org</a>. Gold level contributors of $20 or more will also receive two tickets to an exhibit, whenever it opens. Platinum level contributors of $45 or more will also get two invitations to a special sneak preview event. Diamond level contributors of $75 also get two tickets for <a href=""http://www.jerseyshoretours.com/tour-ac.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">a 'Trump Tour' by Jersey Shore Tours</a>.</p>

<h3>Why Now Is The Time For A Trump Exhibit In AC</h3>
<p>As Donald Trump prepares to take the oath of office as President in just a few days, public interest in his legacy as founder of several now-defunct casinos in Atlantic City continues to grow. Indeed, the shuttering of the Trump Taj Mahal on October 10th, 2016 by Trump’s economic advisor Carl Icahn has led to nearly 3,000 newly unemployed workers in an area that already lost almost 10,000 local jobs when the Trump Plaza and three other Boardwalk casinos closed in 2014. The Taj’s closing also marked the end of an historical era that began in 1984 with the opening of the Plaza, a period when there was always at least one Trump branded casino operating in Atlantic City. After exploring the idea over the last few weeks, the Trump Museum Committee has received offers of artifacts and stories from locals, as well as interest from the general public in staging an exhibit about this ‘Age of Trump in Atlantic City’, and we are now moving forward!</p>

</div><div><p>Putting on an 'Age of Trump in Atlantic City' exhibit --let alone creating a Trump Museum-- will be both challenging and time consuming, especially building a balanced display to high scholarly standards. As a professional public historian completing my doctorate at Temple University, I believe that any such effort involving the broader community also needs to work hard to include diverse voices, so one challenge to this project will be making sure people are aware that it will be designed to reflect the various views of local Atlantic City area residents, rather than as some sort of shrine. Through public outreach the Trump Museum Committee hopes to mitigate the possibility of people misunderstanding what a Trump Museum exhibit in Atlantic City might focus upon. Moreover, both this problem and another potential obstacle, the slim possibility that not enough artifacts are donated to hold an exhibit, can be lessened by getting the word out.</p></div><div>
<h3>Other Ways To Contribute Besides Giving Money</h3>
<p>Even if you can't contribute to our funding goal you can still help the AC Trump Museum Project. The Trump Museum Committee has already started accepting artifacts relating to Trump’s five casinos and collecting stories from those who lived or worked in Atlantic City over the last four decades. Anything related to marketing Trump Castle, Trump Marina, or Trump World’s Fair is especially needed, but all types of objects from photos and playing cards to towels and trays that help to narrate the story of Trump’s Atlantic City casinos are sought with an initial goal of staging a pop-up museum or temporary exhibit as soon as summer 2017 at a location to be determined. Personal stories and images contributed by the community might also end up becoming part of a related book project that has been proposed on <u>Donald Trump’s Atlantic City</u>, and donations may later become part of an archive for scholarly research.

<h3>Learn C# And Unity And Become A Professional Game Developer</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Fahir and I've been making games for more than 3 years now, and teaching people how to do the same for over 2 years. Since the first time I saw a computer I knew what I wanted to do in my life, and that is make games. However, when I started to learn how to create games I got lost and confused because the tutorials on YouTube and other websites did not explain game development very well, and the examples were always presented with a simple cube.</p>
<p>I finally managed to learn game development but I learned it myself, since the resources on the internet were not very useful, and this made me think - What if I create an online course I wish I had when I started to learn game development. And I did, I created Master Unity By Building 6 Fully Featured Games course which was a <strong>HUGE</strong> success, and it has attracted more than 14,000 students.</p>
<p><strong>Now I want to do the same with this course.</strong></p>
<h3>What is Unity3D</h3>
<p>Unity3D is a professional 2D and 3D game development engine used by thousands indie game developers as well as big game development companies such as Ubisoft, Eidos Montreal, and Blizzard. Unity3D is cross-platform, which means you build your game once and you can publish it for iOS, Android, PC, Mac, Linux, Xbox, PS4 and other platforms. The good thing is that <strong>Unity3D has a free plan</strong> that you and I can use to create games, even if we earn money from the games that we create.</p>
<h3>The Course</h3>
<p>I am a self-taught programmer, so I know what it feels like to be a beginner, that's why I made this course <strong>project-based </strong>so students will not just be learning dry programming concepts, but applying them immediately to real games as you go. All the project files will be included, as well as additional references and resources. One of the good things about this course is that <strong>it is hosted on Udemy</strong> and you can watch the videos whenever you want and how many times you want, and the best part of the course is that <strong>I am available every day to answer any questions you might have, so you'll never get stuck</strong>.</p>
<h3>What Will Be Covered In The Course</h3>
<p>This course is comprehensive, if you're a beginner don't worry, I will hold your hand from the very start. I plan to cover the very basic things early on in the course, so you will know everything before we even begin to develop our games.</p>
<p>Take a look at the concepts that I plan to cover in the course:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction To Programming In C#</li>
<li>Intermediate Programming In C#</li>
<li>Advanced Programming In C#</li>
<li>Unity's Interface</li>
<li>Importing And Organizing Assets</li>
<li>Materials</li>
<li>Shaders</li>
<li>Particle System</li>
<li>Unity's UI System</li>
<li>Creating Menus</li>
<li>Navigating From Menus</li>
<li>Animating Menus</li>
<li>Animating 3D Models</li>
<li>Adding Events In Our Animations</li>
<li>Calling Animations From Code</li>
<li>Procedural Level Generation</li>
<li>Pooling Techniques</li>
<li>Melee Battle Systems</li>
<li>Boss Fights</li>
<li>Collectable Items</li>
<li>Score Systems</li>
<li>Creating Beautiful Cut Scenes</li>
<li>Using Lightning To Create Mood In Our Games</li>
<li>Basic Artificial Intelligence</li>
<li>Intermediate Artificial Intelligence</li>
<li>Game Managers</li>
<li>And much more</li>
</ul>
<p>By the end you will learn how to plan, design, create, optimize and publish your games on any platform, and you can even apply for Jr. Game Developer jobs as a Unity 3D developer.</p>
<h3>Why will this course be better than existing courses?</h3>
<p>The course is going to be <strong>project-based</strong>, so students will be able to learn by creating real world games and see tips and tricks the pros use in their games. I am an experienced coder and avid gamer, so I am able to explain complex concepts clearly. And I have a teaching style where I use different approaches to achieve the same thing and talk about the cons and pros one way has over another, and I don't cover a topic only once and stop talking about it for the rest of the course, instead I revisit topics because the best way to learn is by repeating. <strong>I am also a fun and engaging teacher, so you will not be bored during the lectures and I am available every day for help.</strong></p>
<h3>Who is this for</h3>
<p>Anyone who wants to learn to create games: Unity 3D is a fantastic platform which enables you to make production-quality games. Furthermore these games can be created for Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, Consoles, and other platforms all from a single source!</p>
<p>This will be a full course, if you're a complete beginner, I will teach you all the coding and game design principles you'll need. If you're an artist, I will teach you to bring your assets to life. If you're a coder,  I will teach you game design principles. </p>
<h3>I've taught more than 22,000 people how to code and make games</h3>
<p>I mentioned that I am teaching online for more than 2 years. Since I started, I have taught over 22,000 people how to code and make games, and they said some nice things about me:</p>

</div></div>","Learn C# And Unity And Become A Professional Game Developer
Hi, my name is Fahir and I've been making games for more than 3 years now, and teaching people how to do the same for over 2 years. Since the first time I saw a computer I knew what I wanted to do in my life, and that is make games. However, when I started to learn how to create games I got lost and confused because the tutorials on YouTube and other websites did not explain game development very well, and the examples were always presented with a simple cube.
I finally managed to learn game development but I learned it myself, since the resources on the internet were not very useful, and this made me think - What if I create an online course I wish I had when I started to learn game development. And I did, I created Master Unity By Building 6 Fully Featured Games course which was a HUGE success, and it has attracted more than 14,000 students.
Now I want to do the same with this course.
What is Unity3D
Unity3D is a professional 2D and 3D game development engine used by thousands indie game developers as well as big game development companies such as Ubisoft, Eidos Montreal, and Blizzard. Unity3D is cross-platform, which means you build your game once and you can publish it for iOS, Android, PC, Mac, Linux, Xbox, PS4 and other platforms. The good thing is that Unity3D has a free plan that you and I can use to create games, even if we earn money from the games that we create.
The Course
I am a self-taught programmer, so I know what it feels like to be a beginner, that's why I made this course project-based so students will not just be learning dry programming concepts, but applying them immediately to real games as you go. All the project files will be included, as well as additional references and resources. One of the good things about this course is that it is hosted on Udemy and you can watch the videos whenever you want and how many times you want, and the best part of the course is that I am available every day to answer any questions you might have, so you'll never get stuck.
What Will Be Covered In The Course
This course is comprehensive, if you're a beginner don't worry, I will hold your hand from the very start. I plan to cover the very basic things early on in the course, so you will know everything before we even begin to develop our games.
Take a look at the concepts that I plan to cover in the course:

Introduction To Programming In C#
Intermediate Programming In C#
Advanced Programming In C#
Unity's Interface
Importing And Organizing Assets
Materials
Shaders
Particle System
Unity's UI System
Creating Menus
Navigating From Menus
Animating Menus
Animating 3D Models
Adding Events In Our Animations
Calling Animations From Code
Procedural Level Generation
Pooling Techniques
Melee Battle Systems
Boss Fights
Collectable Items
Score Systems
Creating Beautiful Cut Scenes
Using Lightning To Create Mood In Our Games
Basic Artificial Intelligence
Intermediate Artificial Intelligence
Game Managers
And much more

By the end you will learn how to plan, design, create, optimize and publish your games on any platform, and you can even apply for Jr. Game Developer jobs as a Unity 3D developer.
Why will this course be better than existing courses?
The course is going to be project-based, so students will be able to learn by creating real world games and see tips and tricks the pros use in their games. I am an experienced coder and avid gamer, so I am able to explain complex concepts clearly. And I have a teaching style where I use different approaches to achieve the same thing and talk about the cons and pros one way has over another, and I don't cover a topic only once and stop talking about it for the rest of the course, instead I revisit topics because the best way to learn is by repeating. I am also a fun and engaging teacher, so you will not be bored during the lectures and I am available every day for help.
Who is this for
Anyone who wants to learn to create games: Unity 3D is a fantastic platform which enables you to make production-quality games. Furthermore these games can be created for Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, Consoles, and other platforms all from a single source!
This will be a full course, if you're a complete beginner, I will teach you all the coding and game design principles you'll need. If you're an artist, I will teach you to bring your assets to life. If you're a coder,  I will teach you game design principles. 
I've taught more than 22,000 people how to code and make games
I mentioned that I am teaching online for more than 2 years. Since I started, I have taught over 22,000 people how to code and make games, and they said some nice things about me:

<p>The African American Entrepreneurial Academy</p>
<p>also known as the A.A.E.A. is the world’s first entrepreneurial educational facility totally dedicated to building strong, successful and productive African American Men and Women across the United States. The idea was born after bearing witness to multiple decades of African-American men being forgotten by their government, society, their women and being targeted for termination and extinction by the powers that be. The African American Entrepreneurial Academy has furthermore become painfully aware that black people can expect little to no assistance from society as it relates to employment opportunities. As a result, we at the A.A.E.A. have decided that in order to secure the future of our people nationally, we would need to educate and train our African American men and women in entrepreneurial endeavors so that they may create their own jobs through companies they start after graduating the A.A.E.A. When these students graduate from the African American Entrepreneur Academy, they will leave with the relevant knowledge to help them launch, maintain, advertise and grow their very own successful small businesses while being monitored and mentored continuously. Additionally, we anticipate that these new black business owners will residually create thousands of subsequent jobs for others in their communities. Students will also be taught additional studies, information and teachings that they may have missed out from both or either of their parents. So, we ask that you embark on this ambitious and monumental journey with us as we attempt the change the destiny and plight of our precious black men and women across the United States.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>THE $10,000 WILL BE USED THE FOLLOWING WAY:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- HIRE A PUBLICIST TO GET THE PRESIDENT RADIO/TV AIR TIME, PRINT MEDIA (MAGAZINES) SO HE CAN ARTICULATE HIS VISION TO THE WORLD.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>HERE IS HOW WE CAN BE SUCCESSFUL:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>$10,000 initial fundraiser.  The $10,000 can get us </p>
<p>$50,000.  Once the $50,000 is acquired we can generate upwards of $500,000 from a massive national campaign.  Then when we have the $500,000 we can market to the world more effectively to ultimately get the $1,000,000 needed for the academy. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>So $10,000, $50,000, $500,000 to $1million. Four successful gofundme campaigns and we are there.  Sounds like a lot but we can do anything together as one group of people united.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>OUR MISSION; is to teach millions of black men and women across the United States of America everything they need to know on how to start, grow and maintain a black-owned business within their communities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The benefits would be so great that the entire United States would benefits. Here’s how:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- Six million salaried workers paying taxes could generate more than $120 billion dollars annually.</p>
<p>- Six million salaries could ease the burden on the government’s $701 billion dollar relief welfare obligation by 33%, thus helping the government to save $233 billion per year.</p>
<p>- Since blacks comprise approximately one million of the prison systems’ 2.2 million population, 6 million newly employed blacks would save the government 50% of the prison industrial complexes’ annual budget to equal $31 billion dollars saved.</p>
<p>- Our economy where goods and services are purchased could benefit tremendously from a revenue injection of $120 billion. Just think of how housing, cars, hotels, travel industry, food, dining, clothing and product manufacturing, entertainment and sports venues could all benefit. This cash infusion would inspire companies to start hiring more people of all races.</p>
<p>- What about 6,000,000 more people paying into the healthcare industry?</p>
<p>These new jobs will also strengthen the social security coffers and we’ll all benefit from that. Both for people who are retired, retiring and those who will be retiring in the not too distant future.</p>
<p>- Within 10 years, the $120 billion could grow tenfold to an extra one trillion dollars which would strengthen America’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) immensely.</p>
<p>And finally, the entire world would start to feel the effects of these one-million new companies as they begin to grow and prosper.</p>

I live in Providence Rhode Island with my family.  I am originally from Senegal as you can tell from my name and I am passionate about my homeland. I am launching a campaign to raise funds to launch after school enrichment activities including homework help and tutoring on behalf of the children of Guediawaye my hometown near Dakar Senegal. Guediawaye is a town near Dakar Senegal with a high concentration of kids and young adults. Your donation will help us buy school supplies, snacks, and pay stipends for tutors, and cover our overhead expenses. We are starting this initiative which we hope to scale to reach millions of additional children throughout Senegal and Africa.  </p></div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our Goal is to raise $10,000 to run the pilot which we will supplement with local in-kind donations. We will serve 75 children in this pilot for a period of 20-25 weeks.  We will keep costs low by training local youth - high school seniors and college students - to run the program under the supervision of a local coordinator.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Senegal, like many African countries, faces a wide range of challenges that impede its economic advancement. We propose to leverage young people to take the lead to identify and solve the country's most pressing challenges which includes providing an adequate education to its children. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are fully aware that running a project like this in Senegal is not without risk including identifying and recruiting the right staff and tutors i.e. people who are passionate about giving back to their communities and helping children succeed. To mitigate these types of risks, we decided to start with a pilot and intend to identify key lessons which we will use in the next phase of our work. Our board of directors will work closely with the local coordinator in Senegal to oversee the execution of the pilot. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Born in 1952 in Santa Fe of Chicano and Apache descent, Jimmy Santiago Baca was abandoned by his parents and at 13 ran away from the orphanage where his grandmother had placed him. He was convicted on drug charges in 1973 and spent five years in prison. There he learned to read and began writing poetry. His semiautobiographical novel in verse, Martin and Meditations on the South Valley (1987), received the 1988 Before Columbus Foundation’s American Book Award in 1989. In addition to over a dozen books of poetry, he has published memoirs, essays, stories, and a screenplay, Bound by Honor (1993), which was made into a feature-length film directed by Taylor Hackford.</p>
<p>Baca has conducted writing workshops in prisons, libraries, and universities across the country for more than 30 years. In 2004 he launched Cedar Tree, a literary nonprofit designed to provide writing workshops, training, and outreach programs for at-risk youth, prisoners and ex-prisoners, and disadvantaged communities. Baca holds a BA in English and an honorary PhD in literature from the University of New Mexico.</p>
<p>With his continued commitment to support and improve the conditions of communities that are in most need, Jimmy Santiago Baca has revamped and outfitted his RV and trailer to be a bookmobile that will go straight to barrio street corners, parking lots and festivals, to make reading attractive, fun and easy...  and he is asking for YOUR HELP!</p>
<p>Your contributions will put books in children’s and emerging adult reader’s hands on a regular basis and make literacy attractive and engaging in economically depressed areas. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need bookshelves, books for circulation, a set of folding tables and chairs, furniture and supplies for the coffee machines and snacks, an artificial lawn that we can roll out in front of the bookmobile and preliminary funding for staff. </p>
<p>Here is what you will get when you contribute:</p>
<p>$49.00 and under – your name in a bookmobile book as donator, and we will take a photo of  the book cover and the page, with your name on it and send it to you.   </p>
<p>$50.00— AUDIO LIBRARY</p>
<p>$100.00- AUDIO &amp; VIDEO LIBRARY</p>
<p>$ 250.00-  THE ABOVE PLUS SIGNED 1ST EDITION HARDCOVER</p>

<p>$ 20.000- THE ABOVE PLUS THE ILLUSTRATED CHILDREN’S BOOK SERIES</p>
<p>All funds, regardless of whether we make our goal or not, will go toward selecting and purchasing books for circulation, as well, outfitting the RV for remaining needs for operation.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Baca Bookmobile will create the same excitement and anticipation that the neighborhood ice cream truck has when it rolls down the street.  Children, families and adults will know that wherever it stops, they will be able to sit down in the shade, find a book that interests them and read in their community.  If they do not have this opportunity, readers in these communities will have to depend on their trips to schools and libraries. Baca’s Bookmobile brings reading straight to the doorstep of those who need books the most.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The greatest risk and consideration is to maintain the book circulation and collection.  Readers are welcome to buy any book they’d like, but if they cannot afford it, then they can borrow a book. Each book will have a unique Baca’s Bookmobile stamp. If anyone returns a book, in good condition, with the bookmobile stamp and the original receipt from checkout, we will allow them to exchange it for another book.  We don’t know how this system will work out, until we’ve used it for at least three months. </p>
<p>We know that when you just give books away, it will be read once and then put aside.  How do we keep books circulating in the communities in a way that is borrower friendly and consistently rotated and replenished.  This is what we don’t know and will continue to strategize over as we refine the system. </p>
<p>Scheduling the bookmobile locations will be important in creating a predictable time that readers can depend on to read and return books.  In addition of Jimmy Santiago Baca, our team consists of artists, literacy specialists and educators and logistical specialists.  We will take great care in securing a high quality, high interest and varied reading level book collection, and cultural programming at bookmobile presentations that will engage community readers.  We will always be troubleshooting and strategizing to increase participation, build our book collection and promote a reading life for all participants. </p>

I am also a teacher of women's sexuality and spirituality, the somatic approach to healing trauma and a teacher of sacred sexuality,  I have written hundreds of articles which have been published online on a variety of topics. I have dedicated my life to establishing a new paradigm for women's sexuality and of the feminine, and for women and girls to learn how to feel free, powerful and safe in this world.  To be able to walk down the street and be fully in their body and know that it is safe to do so. Sasse Girls, as well as all of my programs for women and teen girls, are designed to support a shift in consciousness first for each person, which can then support a shift in their relationship with their family, friends, community and beyond.  I also have a mentor training for women ages 25-35 to become mentors for the girls who are a part of the Sasse program. I plan to file a non-profit status and have this be used as a model in other communities and have been trained to be a mentor in the Girls to Women training program.Other Ways You Can HelpSPREAD THE WORD

This has inevitably diverted attention towards the urgency of meeting the most basic needs, and away from educational needs which during the crisis has become the least of society's concerns. It has also led to a huge decline in educational services as well as a shortage in the educational workforce as a result of the mass displacement and as a result of people finding alternative work in order to earn a living.What we do?We are able to achieve this by finding a safe space and equipping it with all the required educational supplies for students and teachers, and provide the highest quality of education for the lowest cost through involving the local communities and resources.On a community level:Engaging with the local population has played a key role in raising awareness within communities on the importance of education during the present crisis, particularly as a large number of children have been cut off from all education for almost three years.This has encouraged local youth to participate and fill in the gaps that the educational sector in Syria is suffering from todayOn a school level:We ensure that the schools are equipped to the best standards by offering technical, administrative, logistical and financial help to the schools we run. After they are up and running we remain in direct contact with the schools to support them, should they face any challenges, and to provide support in resolving the issues at hand as quickly as possible. Despite the crisis we believe these children deserve the best schools, and that this is just as much a priority.On teacher’s level:We train the teachers with the fundamental educational techniques, and periodically supervise and reward them for their excellent teaching performance. Feedback is also provided on how their performance can be improved to ensure the teaching methods used are suitable.On children’s level:We have incorporated psychological support into the educational programmes we are delivering. This has greatly encouraged children to return to school, by helping them adapt to school life after experiencing a gap in their education, or helping them cope with attending new schools with new friends due to displacement. Finally it has allowed children to find a safe space to recover from the experiences of the war and provides a daily distraction. This has had a positive impact on overcoming some of the behavioral and social problems that have developed as a result of the conflict.  The ""Ghiras Project"" in numbers:Since 2013, the ""Ghiras Project"" has been able to provide education to over 3500 children through our basic education program, and over 1860 children through our accelerated education program. In addition to this, 4350 children have benefitted from our psychological support project. Our project has also provided work for 333 members of staff as teachers, administrators and psychological support Specialists, 65% of whom are female.Changing a child’s life:This year, we aim to provide education for 1015 children, over 5 schools, and provide jobs for 62 members of staff.Your participation can make 2018 a turning point for a child in Syria. And together we can change the future for these children.Share this great initiative with your family and friends, and encourage them to also be a part of this change today.Our Partners :Facebook Pages : OSRA : https://www.facebook.com/osra.ar/Ghiras : https://www.facebook.com/Ghiras.Pro/Syrian Hands : https://www.facebook.com/syria.hands/Ghiras Japan : https://www.facebook.com/GhirasJP/Ayadee : https://www.facebook.com/orgayadee/Souriyat : https://www.facebook.com/souriyat.across.borders/",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

How cool would it be to play an animated video, with your pictures, music, text for the audience.  Once in a lifetime kind of moments...that won't cost you thousands!






How does it work?



Choose your perk
Pick your templates (Indiegogo Templates)
Send us your photos, text and music choice
We send you an awesome video!

















You're the Director!
Depending on the perk that you choose, you'll have varying flexibility in choosing additional templates, add-ons, narration, etc.  But no matter your choice, you are the director!  That means that you pick the look & feel, you determine the pictures, you decide on what is said.

It's your movie, we'll just help to bring it to life!


FAQ:


Q: What will the video look like?

A: The video will match the template, except that the photos will be swapped out with your images, the text will be changed to say whatever you'd like, and we'll put the whole thing to your choice of music.




Q: When will I receive my video?

A: Each video will receive personal attention, which does take time...but we'll be sure to have your video to you by the timeline outlined within the perk.



Q: What format will my video be in?

A: All videos will be rendered in MP4 format, unless you request otherwise.  From there, you can upload to your mobile device, save on your PC, share on Dropbox, whatever you'd like.





Q: What are the video playback options?

A: Because the video will be in MP4 format, your playback options are nearly endless - it all depends on what device you share it with.


Q: How much can I customize the video?

A: You'll be able to choose the pictures that are displayed, the text, and the music.




Q: I like the idea, but can't find a template that works for me.  Now what?

A: Let us know what you're thinking and maybe we can come up with something for you.




Q: How can I add narration?

A: We have a perk that includes a professional voiceover narrator.  We have many voiceover resources, our intro video demonstrates some of the talent we use.",6.0,0,"3 Campaigns

</p><p><i>Brooklyn Plans brings pop-up financial community
spaces throughout Brooklyn to empower residents financially and revive a sense
of community among disparate groups within (gentrifying) neighborhoods. With $5,000
Brooklyn Plans will be able to launch a financial community space in Red Hook,
a financially underserved neighborhood, for the month of May. With your support
this space will improve Red Hook’s access to reliable financial information,
open up a dialogue between different community members and change how people
perceive the topic of “finances” by making it fun and accessible. </i></p>
<p><b>
</b></p><p><b>What is a financial community space?</b></p>
<p>Visualize a place where you can participate in workshops,
listen to speakers, take a class, send your kids after school or just hang out
with an interesting book, where the theme connecting these different events is
money and the events are low-cost or free. Now imagine this space in your
neighborhood just a few blocks from home. That’s a financial community space
and using a pop-up model, we want to bring them to Brooklyn neighborhoods.</p>
<p><b>Why Red Hook?</b></p>
<p>We want to bring our pop-up program to Red Hook and launch a
financial community space that is open 4 days a week. Red Hook has a history of
being underserved, by city government and financial institutions. In response,
a thriving network of local organizations has sprung up. Each of these local
institutions work to capacitate the neighborhood through the arts, youth
education or community organizing.  The
strength of these local organizations was most apparent after Hurricane Sandy
when they came together with residents in an impressive way. However, the
neighborhood continues to be underserved in the area of financial education. It
does not host either a financial empowerment center or a Single Stop site, two
financial empowerment resources commonly found in underserved
neighborhoods.  By creating a dedicated
financial space we hope to highlight the financial issues affecting Red Hook
residents and mobilize the necessary resources to meet them. </p>
<p><b>We need your help!</b></p>
<p>In order to bring our program to Red Hook we need YOUR
support! This program has taken shape out of the generosity and buy-in from
others. We were graciously donated a beautiful gallery space for the month of
May on a busy intersection in Red Hook that can be easily accessed by community
residents. The $5,000 we raise will cover the cost of insurance and utilities
to run the pop-up for the month, help us convert the bare gallery into an
inviting community space and purchase the necessary supplies for workshops such
as paper, ink, a projector, white boards, markers and books. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1386257/files/20150415132812-Red_Hook_empty_space.jpeg?1429129692"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p>
</p><p>Your contribution will help us get this project off the
ground and bring valuable services to a community in need.If
we are able to secure funding, we would like to extend our stay in Red Hook
through the end of June in a different community location. </p>
<p><b>What we do</b></p>
<p>The programming in a financial community space is based on
the unique needs of each neighborhood. We identify these by using
human-centered design to immerse ourselves in the neighborhood and speaking to residents
and partners to understand the financial realities and needs of that community.
We look at the available financial products and services and analyze how these
measure up against the needs expressed by residents. Finally, we connect with
local partners, citywide agencies, companies, and individuals whose mission
aligns with the values expressed by the community and give them the space to
host an event. Each pop up space feels and looks different because it reflects
the taste and needs of the host community. Each event at the space is an
opportunity for residents to learn, share, collaborate and have fun alongside
one another.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1386262/files/20150415132955-Sample_May_Schedule_.jpg?1429129795"" src="""" style=""width: 462.76237623762376px; height: 607px;""/></p><p></p>

</p><p><b>What we’ve

<p>While many years in the making, we launched Brooklyn Plans
in March and moved quickly to secure a partner in Crown Heights for the month
of April. Our partner, Shoestring Press, is an operating print shop and there we
are open to the community twice a week. In this space we created programming
that was relevant to local residents and members of the shop, a largely
self-employed and artist community. We have the following events on the
calendar:</p>

making finances accessible to the masses. Kristen connected with Jennifer over
their passion for change as financial advisors to underserved New Yorkers at a
local nonprofit. In that role, they worked with thousands of diverse clients to
help them set financial goals, pay down debt and save. They also gathered an
understanding of the financial issues affecting the working poor in NYC and the

<p>
</p>
<p>It was around that time I found out about Ben Schumaker. He had been going to different orphanages and taking pictures of the kids faces. He would bring the pictures home to the states and have art students draw and paint portraits of these kids and then deliver the portraits back to the kids as keepsakes. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>I instantly fell in love with the idea and felt it was a chance for me to help others through art and in spite my eye loss.</b> I was determined to have a try. </p>
<p>In 2014 I took a trip to China to visit an orphanage. This is the great part: I was able to get photos of the kids and bring them back to the states and had my art students paint their portraits.<b> So I am half way there to completing this outreach project! </b>My site documenting the trip can be seen here: <a href=""https://iseeu.squarespace.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://iseeu.squarespace.com</a></p>
<p><b>ALL I NEED TO DO IS TAKE THE PORTRAITS BACK TO THE KIDS IN CHINA!</b></p>
<p><b>I am so excited and passionate about this, and I believe it can really make a difference in their lives</b>. The kids don't have much nor do they have any photos of themselves or a good sense of their value. </p>
<p>These portraits are well made and can last for years. As such they are something that a child can reflect on and realize that someone thought about them and cared enough to paint their picture. <b>On the back of each painting is a picture of the artist and a personal note from the artist about their life along with an encouraging word for the child. </b></p>
<p><b>This is a fantastic opportunity to touch the lives of children who are in tough circumstances and for me personally, to turn the loss I sustained into something really good and positive.</b> I love that idea. I want to replicate this process over and over and touch the lives of many more kids out there in the world who don't have families. This is huge. This is my beginning.</p>

</div><div> <ul> <li>To make this happen I need $3500.00 to return back to China and deliver the portraits. That would complete the first cycle. Please keep in mind that once I arrive there is one inland flight and a road trip necessary to reach the orphanage in Yunnan province. While I am there I plan to visit another orphanage and do the process all over again. This would require another $3500.00. So in total I am looking for $7500.00. This would go towards plane tickets there and back and accommodations.</li> <li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">If we don't  reach our goal we will use the money raised to go forward with delivering the artwork to the kids this summer.</span></li>

</div><div> <ul> <li>This outreach will ""feed"" the children we are able to reach for a long time in the sense that as they grow, they can refer back to their portrait and start to ask questions like: who painted my portrait? why would anyone want to paint me? am I that beautiful? They may also have a sense of gratitude that someone did think about them and did take the time to paint their portrait and write them a personal note.</li> <li>So far we have successfully visited one orphanage in China and have completed all the portraits to send back to the kids there.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>        It's not easy to gain access to many orphanages. Administrators are suspicious         of foreigners coming there and taking photos because of social media and the             possibility that photos can be spread all over the internet these days. The                     biggest challenge we face is getting people familiar with what it is we are doing           and building trust by respecting the guidelines and limitations they require us             to follow.</div>
<ul>
<li>We are able to communicate directly in Chinese with the officials and administrators.</li> <li>We plan to contact orphanages ahead of time to cultivate a relationship with them and begin a dialogue about the process.

It was around that time I found out about Ben Schumaker. He had been going to different orphanages and taking pictures of the kids faces. He would bring the pictures home to the states and have art students draw and paint portraits of these kids and then deliver the portraits back to the kids as keepsakes. 


I instantly fell in love with the idea and felt it was a chance for me to help others through art and in spite my eye loss. I was determined to have a try. 
In 2014 I took a trip to China to visit an orphanage. This is the great part: I was able to get photos of the kids and bring them back to the states and had my art students paint their portraits. So I am half way there to completing this outreach project! My site documenting the trip can be seen here: http://iseeu.squarespace.com
ALL I NEED TO DO IS TAKE THE PORTRAITS BACK TO THE KIDS IN CHINA!
I am so excited and passionate about this, and I believe it can really make a difference in their lives. The kids don't have much nor do they have any photos of themselves or a good sense of their value. 
These portraits are well made and can last for years. As such they are something that a child can reflect on and realize that someone thought about them and cared enough to paint their picture. On the back of each painting is a picture of the artist and a personal note from the artist about their life along with an encouraging word for the child. 
This is a fantastic opportunity to touch the lives of children who are in tough circumstances and for me personally, to turn the loss I sustained into something really good and positive. I love that idea. I want to replicate this process over and over and touch the lives of many more kids out there in the world who don't have families. This is huge. This is my beginning.
What We Need & What You Get
  To make this happen I need $3500.00 to return back to China and deliver the portraits. That would complete the first cycle. Please keep in mind that once I arrive there is one inland flight and a road trip necessary to reach the orphanage in Yunnan province. While I am there I plan to visit another orphanage and do the process all over again. This would require another $3500.00. So in total I am looking for $7500.00. This would go towards plane tickets there and back and accommodations. If we don't  reach our goal we will use the money raised to go forward with delivering the artwork to the kids this summer.


The Impact
  This outreach will ""feed"" the children we are able to reach for a long time in the sense that as they grow, they can refer back to their portrait and start to ask questions like: who painted my portrait? why would anyone want to paint me? am I that beautiful? They may also have a sense of gratitude that someone did think about them and did take the time to paint their portrait and write them a personal note. So far we have successfully visited one orphanage in China and have completed all the portraits to send back to the kids there.    Risks & Challenges
        It's not easy to gain access to many orphanages. Administrators are suspicious         of foreigners coming there and taking photos because of social media and the             possibility that photos can be spread all over the internet these days. The                     biggest challenge we face is getting people familiar with what it is we are doing           and building trust by respecting the guidelines and limitations they require us             to follow.

We are able to communicate directly in Chinese with the officials and administrators. We plan to contact orphanages ahead of time to cultivate a relationship with them and begin a dialogue about the process. I have published a website that shows in detail what it is we do so that people quickly ""get it"".",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

TAPS main mission is to help the survivors in families (husbands, wives, sons, daughters, siblings, parents) whose loved ones gave their lives serving our country in the military, which includes those killed while serving in Afghanistan. 
One small TAPS initiative buys and resells jewelry bracelets made by war widows in Kabul that helps support their livelihoods and allowing them to sending their children to school. http://www.taps.org/afghan/ And a donation PERK for you!
          

Also, by involving TAPS it allows these military families and children survivors to be involved. It helps them knowing that the some of the neediest children and girls now able to attend schools in Afghanistan will have a chance for opportunity. 
It helps promote healing from them knowing that students will have proper school supplies to go along with the opportunity their loved one gave their lives providing to Zahra and others.
I just started college at Lewis and Clark, and am not an aide worker or expert (although I hope to join the Peace Corps after graduation), but I want to do something to help now, I can’t do it alone, but with your help, and the more of us working together, I am sure we can make this happen and have a positive impact on so many young lives.
I am very confident Bonnie, TAPS and our team will work together and find the lowest cost pricing, best delivery, and distribution of any and all supplies to Zahra, her classmates and many more students at other schools.  Please join us?


I am setting an ambitious fundraising goal of $31,000 over 60 days. (one thousand classrooms)

I will work on developing more Perks, but hopefully everyone can expect photos and maybe a Photo Essay with pictures of the school supplies being packaged with care and love by TAPS families and distributed at Afghan schools with video if possible. 

[ The TAPS Good Grief Camps provide support and comfort for children of all ages facing the loss of a loved one in military service. ]

The thought of these children and teens being able to send pens and supplies to help the Zahras and to honor their loved one makes me tear up.
My personal wish is for a picture or video of Zahra smiling while holding lots of colorful pens.
Also, I will personally send you a thank you note - the old fashioned kind, in the mail, with a stamp, handwritten, in pen. :)
If we don't reach our entire goal, then what funds we raise will still go to buy supplies whether several hundred, a few thousand or tens of thousands of pens.
I am donating $100 (earned from my part-time job).
Any amount you can give is appreciated. 
You can even support us by just sharing positive thoughts, words of encouragement and this link. 
Thank you so much for your consideration. 
Peace and Love, 
      Gavrielle




              
P.S. How awesome are Khazar and Bonnie? What amazing role models for me, Zahra and girls everywhere!",11.0,2,"3 Campaigns

Hastings' New Independent Art School</b> <a href=""http://www.niash.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>www.niash.org</span></a></p>
<p>(Charity
status pending)</p>
<p>This is an
ambitious project, set up by local Hastings and London based artists. The
project aims to have a one-year Post Graduate course up and running by October
2016.</p>
<p>NIASH</p>
<p>New
Independent Art School Hastings is an artist led initiative currently at the
embryonic stage of development. The project came about through a series of
conversations that led to the writing of a post graduate course, and through
necessity has led to the expansion of the initiative into a collection of arts
and humanities focused short courses, projects, and programmes.</p>
<p>In the spirit
of our original vision regarding deficits in current art establishment
practice, and inspired by the focus of the post graduate course (still in its
developmental stages) the school's learning programme has been developed with
the social, the collective, and the critical in mind.</p>
<p>In line with
this egalitarian spirit, we've invited practicing artists to write courses
informed by their own current disciplines; asking them to look at their
individual practices as a starting point. They have been given the freedom to
write courses that push the boundaries of the conventional, and have been
encouraged to celebrate and explore what is unique within their own practice
and research. Collaboration, inter disciplinary, collectivity and inclusivity
are at the heart of the short course programme.</p>
<p>One-Year Post
Graduate Course</p>
<p>Critical Art
Practice &amp; Society is a brand new radical fine art course, located 3
minutes from the seafront in Hastings at the heart of the south east coast
contemporary art scene. Our ethos proceeds from an avant-gardist conception of
art as political, formally experimental, and socially positioned.</p>
<p>The programme
is structured as a series of seven intensive modules over the course of one
year.</p>
<p>Students will
take a proactive role as producers of artworks, events and writings. The course
includes activities such as the organization of exhibitions, broadcasts and
talks; research into questions of function, funding and methodology; and the
writing of a manifesto. </p>
<p>Practice and
theory are not separated on this course but are understood within a unified
approach to critical teaching, thinking and production. Discussions, group
readings and screenings will accompany all modules. There is an emphasis on
collaboration understood not in a banal sense of participation but in the
strongest critical, political and social sense as what we call ‘conspirative’:
from ‘con’ (together) + ‘spirare’ (breath).</p>
<p>Hastings'
distinctive creative spirit offers students on this course unique opportunities
for public and collaborative art projects.</p>
<p>Short Course</p>
<p>Our short
course programme starts in September 2015 and has been written by
established Artists living and working in Hastings. The subjects will range
from sound art to political theory, performance to experimental drawing, and
creative writing to sculpture as process.</p>
<p>The
programme's timetable has been designed to fit with different domestic
circumstances to make learning more accessible to those who may have barriers
that restrict their free time, such as work, family, and geographical
distance. </p>
<p>We will be
running 10 week evening classes during term time, three hours per session, for
those who have daytime commitments, as well as 20 hour intensive week long
courses running within school hours for parents and carers, and 20 hour weekend
courses that will span five weeks of four hour sessions.</p>
<p>We have
endeavoured to keep our courses affordable in order to make the programmed
accessible to all.</p>
<p>Summer School</p>
<p>We also have
a very exciting summer school programme starting in June with intensive one-week
courses in a plethora of intriguing and inspiring subjects. We have offered
these courses at a discounted price to our Indiegogo supporters in our list of
'perks'.</p>
<p>Open source</p>
<p>We will be
documenting and archiving all the work that happens within and around the
school. With plans for future works, shows, films, and publications to be
produced. The archive will be accessible to the public. Students, researchers,
and artists working within the school will be encouraged to contribute as well
as utilize this information to help inform the future development of our
arts/educational programme.</p>
<p>The school
aims to be self sustaining by October 2016 and by 2017 we aim to be in a
position to invest any surplus in projects outside the school, essentially
creating a new funding pot for artists and art organizations to access for
projects external to the school itself.</p>

<p>From the
outset, NIASH has planned to run programmes external to the school; working to bring art
practice and education to areas of the town that have not been well served by
the cultural and creative sectors in the past.</p>
<p>Hastings has
a rich cultural heritage, with an established and growing community of artists,
craftists, designers, filmmakers and musicians. This vibrant and pro-active
community has grown organically - with its roots firmly planted within the
unique autonomous, 'independent' and politically dissenting identity Hastings
thankfully refuses to let go of. </p>
<p>The
smugglers, the Tubman, the pirates, the witches, the chimney sweeps, the
fisherman, and the bonfire boys are all a part of our fiercely
anti-establishment history and have left their indelible mark on the town, much
of which can still be seen today.</p>
<p>The areas of
our town that have - against all odds - maintained their historic identities
serve as a brilliant backdrop for the creative communities that have developed
here over the decades. But the town has sprawled out beyond these wards, and
has thus far failed to extend this intoxicating spirit to its outer limits.</p>
<p>The forgotten
wards such as Ore and Hollington have their own identities and communities,
with some incredible projects already being established within them. NIASH aims
to create projects and programmes designed to draw these forgotten wards into
the fold, celebrating their burgeoning creative identities and building
inclusive networks through collective creative experiences.</p>
<p>Everyone
involved in the project is currently working voluntarily to create the course,
exhibition, and residency programmes.</p>
<p>What we don't
currently have is funding to help us buy equipment needed to run projects and
courses and furnish the space. We need audio equipment, cameras, computers and
software for sound based, graphics, animation and film courses and projects. We
need drawing boards and drawing, collage and painting materials. We also need
basic furniture such as built in cupboards, chairs, desks and sound dampening
equipment. As we transform the space we will also need paint and other
decorating materials. We hope to raise enough here to be able to use that money
as a match fund enabling us to equip the school properly.</p>

<strong>
</strong><p>“We are not doing this to make them musicians but to give them their childhood back.” Tamer Nafar, Palestinian Hip Hop Artist.</p>
<p><strong>Summary of Project:</strong></p>
<p>Hip hop was an art form that had arisen out of the South Bronx of New York City during the 70s. It is a perfect example of how creative art forms arise out of times of turmoil. The 1970s was a time when New York City was characterized with despair and hopelessness, and neighborhoods like the South Bronx felt it the most. Out of this art form came artists with a great deal of social consciousness, such as KRS-One and Boogie Down Productions, which was then followed by groups such as Public Enemy whose lyrics all had political commentary, and these artist were not afraid of controversy, as they expressed feelings of frustration felt by African-Americans and other minority communities throughout the United States. <br/></p>
<p>Little did many of these artists realize was that their music would have an impact on communities who felt oppressed and disconnected all over the world, from the Middle Eastern and South Asian communities of Europe to the Middle East itself to many different parts of Africa. Even the famous Korean rapper, Psy, was actually making a satirical video, when he created the famous song and video, Gangnam Style. Many of Psy’s music have a great deal of social and political commentary about Korean society and the rest of the world.<br/></p>
<p>Last year I had created a curriculum called <a href=""https://ichiouhuang.wordpress.com/2014/01/20/hip-hop-as-a-vehicle-for-social-change/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>Hip
Hop as a Vehicle for Social Change</u></a>. I came across an article about <a href=""http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/12/2013-palestinian-hi"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>Palestinian
Hip Hop</u></a>. I have read about Middle Eastern hip hop artists, as well as European
hip hop artists of Middle Eastern and South Asian descent, but this article
helped give me a much better insight of the hip hop scene in the Middle East. I
could not help but draw the parallels between how hip hop thrived in Palestine
and how it first originated in the South Bronx during the 1970s, which is how I
created this curriculum. </p>
<p>As someone who grew up on hip hop, too, I have seen
the music evolve from an art form in the South Bronx to a completely global
movement. No matter what part of the world, the underlying theme is always the
same. It serves as a voice for youth who feel alienated and disenfranchised,
and through this art form it has had the capability to transform the social
environment, empowering youth in a way that they never thought they could. It has also influenced presidential elections, which I highlight in the piece, while also serving as the soundtrack for Arab Spring.</p>
<p>While hip hop is often portrayed negatively in the media and
has become very commercialized in much of the world, there are still pockets of
the hip hop community that have maintained the authenticity of the art form and have
even used it as a powerful tool to affect social change, and this is what my
curriculum is about. I created this curriculum for high school teachers and
college professors. The course can be taught in either a social studies class,
especially in a Civics class, as well as an English class. The Website serves
as blueprint for educators who can tailor it to their own classroom. </p>
<p>

<p>As an <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/profile/public-profile-settings?trk=prof-edit-edit-public_profile"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">educator and community organizer</a> for 18 years, I have
a proven track record of developing <a href=""http://yes-competition.org/yes/teaching-units/discipline.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">curriuculum</a>, creating programs that involve

am also a huge fan of hip hop: the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Ichiou/media_set?set=a.10150366743317793.352712.714962792&amp;type=3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">graffiti</a>. I remember, when I first listened to political hip hop artists, such a KRS-1, Public Enemy and Paris. I lamented, when I saw hip hop artists here in the United States stray away from this kind of socially conscious hip hop but was ecstatic to find out that there was a new generation of hip hop artists overseas who were continuing to this type of hip hop. Artists like Lowkey, Abdallah, Tamer Nafar, and Okinawan rapper Akiko Urasaki have carried that torch and are not afraid to push the envelope because that is what music is supposed to do: transform societies.  I truly believe that this curriculum can be a very useful tool for other

<p>The curriculum also helps young people realize that they have more in common than they realize. The recent protests in Ferguson, Missouri regarding the shooting of Michael Brown was a perfect example.

<p>Furthermore, we now live in an age where there is too much emphasis in the education community on standardized testing. Educators all throughout the United States are inundated with policy about meeting the Common Core standards to the point that some schools practically teach to a test. Parents and their children are constantly bombarded with information about high stakes testing. A curriculum such as this allows educators to not only teach material that will appeal to their students, but will also allow them to expand their mind and understand why education is so important in their lives. After all, the mission of giving someone an education is not only to provide them knowledge that allows them to function as a productive citizen, but it also teaches them how to think. The curriculum can also help students meet Common Core student because it does teach students how to think critically while also demonstrating how to illustrate a point and make an argument, all part of the goals and objectives of the Common Core.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I am given a very short time window. I have
to let the conference organizers know by May 10. However, I believe
in this curriculum enough that there will be enough support to get this project
funded.

I also have experience in non-profit and campaign fundraising.

 Furthermore, what I am requesting is certainly a realistic goal.

Summary of Project:
Hip hop was an art form that had arisen out of the South Bronx of New York City during the 70s. It is a perfect example of how creative art forms arise out of times of turmoil. The 1970s was a time when New York City was characterized with despair and hopelessness, and neighborhoods like the South Bronx felt it the most. Out of this art form came artists with a great deal of social consciousness, such as KRS-One and Boogie Down Productions, which was then followed by groups such as Public Enemy whose lyrics all had political commentary, and these artist were not afraid of controversy, as they expressed feelings of frustration felt by African-Americans and other minority communities throughout the United States. 
Little did many of these artists realize was that their music would have an impact on communities who felt oppressed and disconnected all over the world, from the Middle Eastern and South Asian communities of Europe to the Middle East itself to many different parts of Africa. Even the famous Korean rapper, Psy, was actually making a satirical video, when he created the famous song and video, Gangnam Style. Many of Psy’s music have a great deal of social and political commentary about Korean society and the rest of the world.
Last year I had created a curriculum called Hip
Hop as a Vehicle for Social Change. I came across an article about Palestinian
Hip Hop. I have read about Middle Eastern hip hop artists, as well as European
hip hop artists of Middle Eastern and South Asian descent, but this article
helped give me a much better insight of the hip hop scene in the Middle East. I
could not help but draw the parallels between how hip hop thrived in Palestine
and how it first originated in the South Bronx during the 1970s, which is how I
created this curriculum. 
As someone who grew up on hip hop, too, I have seen
the music evolve from an art form in the South Bronx to a completely global
movement. No matter what part of the world, the underlying theme is always the
same. It serves as a voice for youth who feel alienated and disenfranchised,
and through this art form it has had the capability to transform the social
environment, empowering youth in a way that they never thought they could. It has also influenced presidential elections, which I highlight in the piece, while also serving as the soundtrack for Arab Spring.
While hip hop is often portrayed negatively in the media and
has become very commercialized in much of the world, there are still pockets of
the hip hop community that have maintained the authenticity of the art form and have
even used it as a powerful tool to affect social change, and this is what my
curriculum is about. I created this curriculum for high school teachers and
college professors. The course can be taught in either a social studies class,
especially in a Civics class, as well as an English class. The Website serves
as blueprint for educators who can tailor it to their own classroom. 


This year I was approved to present this curriculum at the IEARN 2015 Conference. which is taking place in Brasilia. IEARN is a non-governmental organization that I have been a member of for almost 15 years. The organization seeks to unite students and educators all over the world through project-based, collaborative learning, utilizing the Internet as the means for this to happen, and now I have the opportunity to present this workshop to my fellow members, including many educators from the Middle East. The host nation this year is also an ideal location because the nation of Brazil has also served as another hub for socially conscious, progressive hip hop. Please find a breakdown of the budget below:

<p><b>Our Story</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>A decade ago a Rwanda girl got kicked out of an orphanage in Uganda. She was sixteen. She was in Uganda because a decade earlier she escaped genocide, fleeing her country. Being in the street was obviously not her first option, but she did choose it. </p>
<p></p>
<p>After being expelled from her residence, she offered to work in the home in exchange for shelter. They accepted. When she found out the orphange wouldn't provide refuge to four HIV positive orphans she reclaimed  her persona non grata status. She found herself in the street - again - taking care of four rejected and sick kids.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Time went by, the stubborn girl grew up, got married, left Uganda. And the four children? What started as an act of compassion and rebelion became an orphanage itself: Mupenzi Children's Home. Home to thirty nine lives. But this story was of love, not of success.</p>

Thirty nine children shared two rooms, enjoyed one meal a day, slept in no beds. In his twenty years lifespan he had never faced such misery. Francisco - being human - deemed the conditions inaceptables. When he told me he was bettering the lives of thirty nine kids and that, ""Bud, all help is welcomed and needed to rebuild Mupenzi Children's Home,"" I was glad to join him in Uganda.</p></div>

<p></p>
<p>Now in our twenty years of existence we've never received so much joy. Francisco's organization - Petits Detalls - rented a better home where the children sleep in beds and eat at a table once a day with their uncles Francisco and Mateo. School provides two more daily meals. And education is a privilege they couldn't afford just a short time ago. Only three months ago, kids woke up at four thirty in the morning to fetch water all morning, and some others couldn't attend due to lack of resources. It's a struggle that continues today.</p>

And yes, we can take beautiful life lessons from it, meet heroic people like Tira (orphanage's founder). But let's spend a few seconds acknowledging the tragedy of it all. How sad it is to live in a world where large quantities of water costs pennies, yet people still can't afford it. We inhabit a planet were the price of a beer in the States covers the ugandan primary school fees of a child for a whole week. I'm not bringing this up so that every time you lose a penny you fell ashamed, nor am I reprimanding American beer drinkers. I just want you to know how privileged some of us are with our loose change and drunken nights. You drinking one less or six more beers won't condemn a Ugandan child to a life of poverty, and it will not fix the world's problem. So what are we campaigning for? What's the point?</div></div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>To alter your perception of reality. To expand your horizon. That will change the world. And the children's. Convincing you is easy: Who hasn't had hunger once or twice in their life? You've been cold and thirsty and sad - if only for a minute.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But maybe you can't relate? Because your hunger doesn't mean death, your incompetent president isn't an oppressive dictator and blue and red states aren't the same as a civil war. If that's the case I dare you to get interested: getting to know these thirty nine children will suffice (Francisco and I will gladly share more info by email.) These kids are both a telescope and a microscope. They are Uganda, Africa, the world; they are also America, your state, your family. You. </p>
<p></p>
<p>You, with so much public confidence and private fears. I know. I'm the same: never cutting my hair because I'm afraid it'll never grow back. And you who needs to lose a few pounds - you are your harshest critic. You fit and sexy people who know your didn't get here thanks to your looks: why do you sometimes believe you did? You're not alone. Vanity strikes and unites us all. But - again - I wonder if these kids are not alone. Who can relate? Are you brave enough? They can be so transparent that in the right light you might see yourself reflected. Or even worse - share for a breif moment an ineffable experience. </p>

School provides two daily meals to each children. It also provides education: crucial for their future, and ours as a community.
The school fees per trimester per child costs 45 dollar.
Reaching our goal is paramount!  Share our cause with everyone. 




Our Story

A decade ago a Rwanda girl got kicked out of an orphanage in Uganda. She was sixteen. She was in Uganda because a decade earlier she escaped genocide, fleeing her country. Being in the street was obviously not her first option, but she did choose it. 

After being expelled from her residence, she offered to work in the home in exchange for shelter. They accepted. When she found out the orphange wouldn't provide refuge to four HIV positive orphans she reclaimed  her persona non grata status. She found herself in the street - again - taking care of four rejected and sick kids.

Time went by, the stubborn girl grew up, got married, left Uganda. And the four children? What started as an act of compassion and rebelion became an orphanage itself: Mupenzi Children's Home. Home to thirty nine lives. But this story was of love, not of success.








Francisco Germain found a home five months ago: orphanage by name, poverty by definition. Thirty nine children shared two rooms, enjoyed one meal a day, slept in no beds. In his twenty years lifespan he had never faced such misery. Francisco - being human - deemed the conditions inaceptables. When he told me he was bettering the lives of thirty nine kids and that, ""Bud, all help is welcomed and needed to rebuild Mupenzi Children's Home,"" I was glad to join him in Uganda.







Now in our twenty years of existence we've never received so much joy. Francisco's organization - Petits Detalls - rented a better home where the children sleep in beds and eat at a table once a day with their uncles Francisco and Mateo. School provides two more daily meals. And education is a privilege they couldn't afford just a short time ago. Only three months ago, kids woke up at four thirty in the morning to fetch water all morning, and some others couldn't attend due to lack of resources. It's a struggle that continues today.





Enrolling all of our thirty nine kids in school the whole year costs 5,265 dollars. The fees might seem cheap, but education is priceless. And our need to seek funds - even this small amount of help - illustrates the dire situation we live in. If education is a right, providing it is an obligation. Help us fulfill this cause.







The story of this orphanage - or rather: this family - is a tale of survival and we hope of overcoming. And yes, we can take beautiful life lessons from it, meet heroic people like Tira (orphanage's founder). But let's spend a few seconds acknowledging the tragedy of it all. How sad it is to live in a world where large quantities of water costs pennies, yet people still can't afford it. We inhabit a planet were the price of a beer in the States covers the ugandan primary school fees of a child for a whole week. I'm not bringing this up so that every time you lose a penny you fell ashamed, nor am I reprimanding American beer drinkers. I just want you to know how privileged some of us are with our loose change and drunken nights. You drinking one less or six more beers won't condemn a Ugandan child to a life of poverty, and it will not fix the world's problem. So what are we campaigning for? What's the point?


To alter your perception of reality. To expand your horizon. That will change the world. And the children's. Convincing you is easy: Who hasn't had hunger once or twice in their life? You've been cold and thirsty and sad - if only for a minute.

But maybe you can't relate? Because your hunger doesn't mean death, your incompetent president isn't an oppressive dictator and blue and red states aren't the same as a civil war. If that's the case I dare you to get interested: getting to know these thirty nine children will suffice (Francisco and I will gladly share more info by email.) These kids are both a telescope and a microscope. They are Uganda, Africa, the world; they are also America, your state, your family. You. 

You, with so much public confidence and private fears. I know. I'm the same: never cutting my hair because I'm afraid it'll never grow back. And you who needs to lose a few pounds - you are your harshest critic. You fit and sexy people who know your didn't get here thanks to your looks: why do you sometimes believe you did? You're not alone. Vanity strikes and unites us all. But - again - I wonder if these kids are not alone. Who can relate? Are you brave enough? They can be so transparent that in the right light you might see yourself reflected. Or even worse - share for a breif moment an ineffable experience. 
When Sharifa - a seven year old whom malnutrition has trapped in an infant's body - saw anyone carrying a stick she would lie down in front of him or her and wait to be beaten. Flora would like to celebrate her birthday (as would many others) but doesn't know the date, and has never met her parents to ask them.



(Sharifa)


What we're feeling right now is compassion. But compassion shouldn't be just a happy/sad feeling. It's an attitude. It's the courage to be vulnerable and the ambition to help where help is needed. It's not
helping African children far far away (but yes, please help us), it's being your neighbors' helping hand, welcoming ears, a shoulder to cry on.




It's giving voice to the voiceless. Because this message isn't ment to be read, but spoken. So share it as I'm sharing it now. 
We will continue to pursue any opportunity that will grant these kids a childhood. We aren't asking for spare change. But change - as only education can provide.

</p><p><b>Short Summary:</b></p>
<p>Mongolia is
known across the world for the amazing dinosaur skeletons found from its Gobi
Desert. Skeletons of such well known species as <i>Tarbosaurus</i>, <i>Velociraptor</i>, and
<i>Protoceratops</i> are exhibited is museums in New York, Warsaw, Moscow, but as
shocking as it might seem, no dinosaur museum exists in the Gobi Desert. As a
result most Mongolian kids know little about their dinosaurs and do not have
the opportunity to see these stunning specimens. We have acquired a
state-of-the art mobile dinosaur museum and have brought it to Ulaanbaatar, the
capital city of Mongolia with support of Gerry Ohstrom and Epicurus Fund. Help
us prepare the museum for the long trek to the Gobi and get Mongolian kids
excited about dinosaurs and science.</p>
<p><b>Campaign
Description:</b></p>
<p><i>About
the Project</i></p>
<p>The
moveable dinosaur museum is a state-of-the art, walk-in, 37-foot long, handicap
accessible vehicle. Inside are exhibits with scientifically accurate dinosaur
casts, reconstructions, and videos, many of which feature Mongolian dinosaurs
like <i>Velociraptor</i> and <i>Protoceratops</i>. Since 2005 the moveable museum has reached
thousands of school kids while traveling throughout the New York City area. Now
it is time to move this important moveable museum to the Gobi Desert of
Mongolia!</p>
<p><i>Our
Goal</i></p>
<p>Our campaign
goal of $7900 will fund transportation expenses for the moveable dinosaur
museum, educational supplies, snacks for students, staff salaries and the
transportation, and room and board for the staff members. We estimate that it
will cost $1300 in gasoline and tolls round trip to bring the moveable dinosaur
museum to the Gobi, and an additional $700 will cover registration and
insurance for this vehicle. Educational supplies will cost $350, including the
drafting and printing of educational activities, multiple copies of children’s
dinosaur books, and the lamination of dinosaur cards for repeated use. The
salaries of four staff members (scientist, educator, coordinator, and driver)
for a total of 10 days will cost $3400. The staff members room and board for 10
days will cost $1650. The transportation for the staff members will cost $500.</p>
<p><i>Impact</i></p>
<p>If
you ask Mongolian kids to name one Mongolian dinosaur, most of them struggle.
Unlike kids in the US, they just do not have access to books and TV shows on
dinosaurs in their native language. We will change all that. Our 10-day program
should reach 120 Mongolian school kids: 30 kids from Bulgan town (just a few miles
from the famous Flaming Cliffs dinosaur locality), 60 kids from Dalanzadgad
(provincial capital of the Flaming Cliffs locality) and 30 kids from Mandalgovi (provincial capital of Dundgovi). We anticipate that once we
establish a solid track record of education with the moveable museum in
Mongolia with support from this Indiegogo campaign, we will be well positioned
to ask for additional funding from several grant agencies to bring the museum to
other parts of Mongolia. Eventually, we anticipate that the museum will be able
to visit 88 schools, 16 summer camps, and reach 15,000 children every year, and
will completely change the landscape of k-12 science education on Mongolia. Our
project will build on a growing interest in dinosaurs in Mongolia that follows
the repatriation of many stolen dinosaur skeletons. Mongolian and International
media has been covering these repatriations, and the return of these dinosaurs
has become a major point of Mongolian pride.</p>
<p><i>Who

<p>The
ISMD, with the support of the Museum of the Rockies, launched the first
dinosaur-focused educational outreach project in Mongolia in 2009. This project
reached 32 rural and nomadic kids who live near some of the most famous
dinosaur localities in the world. A news story about this project can be found

<p>Since
then, the ISMD has continued to conduct educational outreach programs in the
Gobi desert and Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia, and since 2012 they
expanded their activities to the US so that they could reach Mongolian children
living abroad. The ISMD, with the help of several generous donors, has provided
financial support to Mongolian students pursuing graduate degrees in
paleontology and geology. Most recently the ISMD worked closely with the
Mongolian government to bring illegally exported Mongolian dinosaurs back home.

at the following link: http://www.cbc.ca/player/Radio/More+Shows/Dispatches/2009/ID/1470583471/
Since
then, the ISMD has continued to conduct educational outreach programs in the
Gobi desert and Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia, and since 2012 they
expanded their activities to the US so that they could reach Mongolian children
living abroad. The ISMD, with the help of several generous donors, has provided
financial support to Mongolian students pursuing graduate degrees in
paleontology and geology. Most recently the ISMD worked closely with the
Mongolian government to bring illegally exported Mongolian dinosaurs back home.

<b> </b>Passado Action Theatre is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization which aims to keep the arts alive in schools and communities where lack of funding has reduced student exposure to live theatre.  Artistic directors Dennis McLaughlin and Ri Walton toured throughout New England performing and teaching Shakespeare and performance techniques in hundreds of schools for nearly 20 years. Since moving to California in 2001  they have had great success working with teachers to bring action theatre techniques to productions of A Midsummer Night's Dream, Macbeth, Romeo and Juliet, and more.

Human character has not changed since the writing of the Constitution. Therefore, the Constitution is as valid today as when it was written. It means the same thing now as when written. The Constitution is the legal datum for our country, it does not change with time--unless we change it through amendment process. If the Constitution is interpreted differently over time we will not know where we will end up. It is up to the current stewards as they come and go to be true to it.

There should be very little overlap, if any. This position is based on the intent of the Constitution. It is not based on what interpretation is in vogue. Human character has not changed since the writing of the Constitution. Therefore, the Constitution is as valid today as when it was written. It means the same thing now as when written. The Constitution is the legal datum for our country, it does not change with time--unless we change it through amendment process. If the Constitution is interpreted differently over time we will not know where we will end up. It is up to the current stewards as they come and go to be true to it. It is the duty of every generation to hand this country off intact to the next generation. As citizens strive for their potential, building on past generations, the country improves in an endless cycle. There is no need for the various parts of government to change or expand roles.(The statement above refers to the Congress of the confederate government, but it is applicable to the Congress of the federal government of today too.)The Institute is not aligned with any political ideology. It is the 
intent of the Institute to encourage application of libertarian to 
liberal ideas as is appropriate for the intended task. What is being 
proposed is to move governance, as much as possible and constitutional, 
from a nebulous complex central government to as-local-as-is-possible 
government. Competition improves the breed, this goes for government 
too. By removing overlaying central government from domestic governance 
and having the states handle their own domestic issues puts competition 
in play thus improving governance. This should result in the best 
environment for both business and for individual citizens.This country has tremendous potential, if only big intrusive government would get out of the way so it could be realized. Three quarters of the people of this country think we are on the wrong path. The only difference between the two parties is one goes down the left side and the other the right side of the same path. It is still the wrong path. We need to think anew for solutions to an out of control United States government. We are on the wrong path. Now is the time to make corrections and return to course, a course prescribed by the Constitution.Founding of the Constitutional Renaissance Institute is motivated by the belief that it is individual citizens realizing as much of their potential as possible that, in the aggregate, makes a great society. Government affects us all, get it right and we all do better, get it wrong and we all suffer. The key to our potential is respecting the Constitution of the United States (""...its only keepers, the people.""--George Washington). Since we all are in this together, it would be great (and humbling) to get millions of small contributions to fund this project and help realize the potential that is in all of us--""We the People of the United States.""Registration as an LLC and application for non-profit organization 501c(3) are in process.",4.0,1,"1 Campaign

We are an interdisciplinary Unmanned Aerial Systems team of 45 engineering students at the University of California, Riverside.

Goal


 

Last year we overcame challenges associated with being a new team and competing for the first time, but now we're stepping it up. We want to succeed where last year we struggled, writing better software and designing a more agile plane. These task are not easy to overcome though. We need better processors, simulation software, and material for the proof of concepts, prototypes, and the final build. Not to mention we have to travel across the entire country with all of our equipment.  


Your Impact
This is where your contributions come in. Whether your buying the 3D Printed plane because its interesting or donating because your passionate about learning through experience and competition, your contributions are needed for us to be able to compete. What you donate will be used to purchase those carbon fiber booms we need so badly, purchase new battery packs to give us more flight time, or even go towards someones plane ticket, so were not representing ourselves with 2 people at the competition.

<p>CAIR-Chicago is a not-for-profit organization registered in Illinois.
 Though it leverages the resources, expertise, and knowledge base of CAIR
 (based in Washington), it functions as an independent organization that
 sets its own strategy and goals.</p>
<p>Our work at CAIR-Chicago spans four different areas.</p>
<p><em>Firstly</em>, we deal with <strong>civil rights</strong> issues, 
taking up complaints ranging from bigoted gestures to official 
discrimination against Muslims. We create logs for incidents and pursue

sensitivity training for the perpetrating party to all out legal

public about the civil rights plight of Muslims.<br/>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.cairchicago.org/images/aboutus_header.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>
<em>Secondly</em>, we are involved in <strong>political empowerment</strong>
 helping community members understand and utilize the political system 
to work for them. Projects include voter registration drives, community 
workshops, “know your rights” educational campaigns, and training of 
mosques and Muslim centers on how to contact local and national 
politicians.</p>
<p><em>Thirdly</em>, we are involved in <strong>media monitoring</strong>.
 We monitor the local media closely and flag bias against Muslims. We 
respond accordingly to editors and producers with letters, phone calls, 
or meetings. We mobilize the community in letter writing campaigns to 
reinforce feedback sent to the media.</p>
<p><em>Lastly</em>, we are involved in <strong>community outreach</strong>.
 We forge mutually beneficial partnerships with local and national 
institutions whose activities overlap with CAIR-Chicago’s in order to 
maximize efficiency. We work to empower the Muslim community and to 
foster an understanding between Chicago’s Muslim and non-Muslim 
communities via public education, and to serve the needs of the 
Chicagoland community via public service.</p>
<p><strong>CAIR-Chicago Aspires to be:</strong></p>

<li>
<strong>Credible</strong>: Gain the trust and respect of all involved.</li>
<li>

<strong>Proactive</strong>: Create programs that predict and preemptively challenge potential problems.</li>

<em>Firstly</em>, we want to leverage the potent power of the volunteer 
base in our community. We have set up a powerful system to recruit and 
place volunteers in the right place at the right time leading to maximum
 efficiency. We take into consideration each volunteer’s talents, set of
 skills, and interests and then place them accordingly in a project, so 
that it is simple plug-and-play. This also makes volunteering with us 
enjoyable for them and not merely a chore. We regard them as community 
activists, and not simply volunteers. We believe in clearly defined 
goals for each project, and setting milestones so that progress is 
tangible and measurable.</p>
<p><em>Secondly</em>, we wish to bypass conventional barriers that have 
plagued our community in the past. We wish to dissolve the generational,
 class, and racial gaps by stressing the common aspirations and 
challenges that face us all. Huge progress has been done in bypassing 
such barriers in the first few months of our recent inception. We are 
especially keen to see the gap between the transnational (mostly Arab 
and South Asian) and indigenous (mostly African-American) Muslim 
communities dissolve.</p>
<p>We also are very vigilant in avoiding potential pitfalls that usually
 create tension and rifts in the Muslim community, such as dogmatic 
disagreements between religious currents or schools of thought. We are 
not a religious organization in that we don’t issue decrees, nor 
interpret religious text for the people. We are a community services 
organization and as such we wish to serve with integrity and 
professionalism any party that sees itself as Muslim. A clear and 
dominant theme in our work is inclusion.</p>
<p>CAIR-Chicago is a different kind of organization. Though it 
officially launched January 5th, 2005, the vision and strategy of its 
board and staff are already cause for high expectations and excitement. 
Its track record over the “incubation” period between September 2004 and
 the launch date speaks of a bright future.</p>
<p>We hope that we can work together.<br/>

One-third of the world's population could be short-sighted by 2020.
 (Source: Brien Holden Vision Institute)

Up to 90% of Asian schoolchildren are near-sighted. (Source: The Lancet, 5 May 2012)


In the United States of America, myopia has increased 66% in 30 years. (Source: National Eye Institute)


Severe myopia could lead to complications including retinal detachment, glaucoma, macular degeneration, cataract and even blindness. (Source: Singapore Health Promotion Board)

The situation is bad, but it's only getting worse!


THE GOOD NEWS
Much of the ""school myopia"" that children face today are linked to environmental factors like long periods of near work and reading in poor lighting conditions. The good news is that all this can be prevented with good reading habits!
That's why we invented...




BookBuddy™ is the smart bookstand which reminds your child to read in good reading conditions through the use of smart sensors. It helps our children to develop healthier reading habits, thereby improving their visual and spinal health. 



HOW IT WORKS
Ergonomic Features



Supports all book sizes





*BookBuddy™ is not just for books. It works great with tablets and smartphones too!


Clever Sensors




We love colours!
You have 3 attractive colours to choose from. Once we’re ready for mass production, we will contact you personally regarding your choice of colours and preferred delivery address.



WHAT EYE EXPERTS SAY
Eye experts recommend three rules that aid in the prevention of myopia. We have implemented all of them into the BookBuddy™: 


1. Hold the book about 30cm away from their eyes while reading. 
2. Ensure there is adequate lighting in the room while reading. 
3. Take a break after 30 minutes of near work.

</h3>
<p>My name is Briana and I am a 3rd year Sociology/Psychology student at Purchase College and an intern at my college's Wellness Center. At the Wellness Center we have yoga instructors and faculty that are certified to help students with all sorts of problems. Our main goal is to help students become mindful and to take care of their wellness (hence the name :D)! In doing so we provide Yoga sessions, massage sessions, a biomat, meditation, interns to talk their non-crisis problems out, and so on. We have had energy work sessions done by past interns too. The problem is that we don't have enough materials and 0 funding to help us expand our sessions. <br/></p>
<p>Wellness is extremely important for college students to learn and to have access to these programs. Stress, anxiety, and depression run high among students as they learn new experiences, deal with large amounts of work, and over all learn to become an adult. Having Yoga, meditation, and all these other classes have benefited students mental health, which helps their physical health as well. <br/></p>
<p>I would like to raise money to bring in my own program of crystal energy work to the Wellness Center. In the past meditation and energy work sessions have attracted a lot of students and had a great outcome. I feel that doing crystal grids and crystal massage therapy will be beneficial along side our yoga programs. I grew up using crystals as a kid and still do today. I find them to help a lot of people refocus their intentions, attention, and re-center themselves. Whether it is true that crystals give off energies that can influence us, or a placebo effect, does not actually matter. What matters is that students are able to find a way to relax so that they can remain focused and healthy. My crystal program would be held 2-4 times a week and would consist of laying down meditation while I constructed the appropriate grids around them.  I will also supply information on what crystals to use for their intentions if they want to meditate alone or buy their own. I am well researched in crystal energy work and have plenty of reference books to refer to if needed be. If I could I would make a profession out of crystal energy work and massage therapy. This is why I am hoping to get funds for this program so that maybe it will lead me to a new path. I am very passionate about crystal energy work and its effects on the body. Launching this program would be so exciting for not just be but the whole Wellness Center. <br/></p>
<p>The funding money will go to purchasing appropriate basic crystal stones, wands, and massage pieces. Blankets and cushions will also be purchased to make a comfortable space for those who participate. I am asking for $500 in funds to achieve this goal. <br/></p>
<p>I want to expand my knowledge and practices with crystals so that I can share it with others. I feel that I can help a lot of people with these practices and create a mindful community. To launch my program would be my way of giving back to the campus. I am a full time student and live off campus so not only is money extremely tight as I commute an hour everyday and back, but I also lack a sense of community from being back and forth. My crystal program can help me establish a sense of purpose and community in this school while helping students with their problems. <br/></p>
<p>Please consider donating even just a little. Every penny will help! Pictures will be provided to show the progress! Take part in the future generation's wellness :) </p>
<p>If you cannot donate please share this campaign around! It would be great to talk to other crystal users for tips and ideas. <br/></p>

<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Hi Loves! This is your friendly neighborhood Orisha priest, rootworker, folklorist, and social justice activist &amp; advocate who is working to do something pretty huge!</span><br/>
</div>
<div>October brought a life-changing opportunity to not only uplift my conditions but to give me further ritual training, education, skills, and energy so I can be an even better priest, teacher, and advocate for my beloved community.</div>
<div>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">What's the Opportunity?</b><br/>
</div>
<div>Based upon my dedication to community and service over the years, an invitation has been extended to travel to Nigeria in February with an esteemed elder and teacher, and to take the high priesthood initiation in IFA, the root of all Orisha religions. In addition to receiving this once-in-a-lifetime spiritual elevation, I will also train in traditional medicine making, and herbalism.</div>
<div><b>Who am I?</b></div>
<div>I'm Lou and I'm a magical guy! :-)</div>
<div>I'm deeply moved, inspired, and motivated by our innate connection to the life-giving force in all its forms. Over the years I have had the blessed opportunity, and amazing good fortune, to learn from indigenous healers, teachers, elders, artists, and activists in a variety  of traditions and forms. </div>
<div>The IFA Tradition, born in Nigeria and transported throughout the world during the Middle Passage, is not only beautiful and awe-inspiring, but it has profoundly impacted the way I live in the world. The teachings view the cosmos as imbued with emanate life force and spiritual power which supports our individual journeys and evolutionary processes as we move towards the biggest versions of ourselves and our lives.</div>
<div><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Where will I be and what will I be doing?</b></div>
<div>I will be traveling throughout Nigeria for twenty one days during the initiation and training process, but some of the highlights are: </div>
<div>-visiting  Osogobo and meeting the Oshun River, temple, and community</div>
<div>-traveling to Ile Ife  and Ekiti for ceremony</div>
<div>-going to one of the world's oldest witchcraft markets!</div>

<p>Hello everyone I am an aspiring Expressive Arts Therapist. I was led to study abroad in Canada for love and the arts. I have always loved the arts. I studied music in Chicago and it was through music school that I learned that above a musician I am an emotionalist. I love music because of how it allows me to connect with my intuition while expressing universal emotions to myself and those around me. It is through this connection that we can feel the interconnected creative force that unites us all. </p>
<p>Expressive arts therapy is intermodal (poetry, drama, comedy,visual arts, music etc) healing and expression through the arts.</p>
<p>As a client of expressive arts therapy I have experienced the power of the arts as a transformative tool for healing throughout your life. What I see with EXA is that the client is empowered to actively transform an event, thought or feeling through the arts. It is through the power of the arts and trusting the creative process that this healing takes place. With EXA we see the therapist as a companion and the client as the expert on their life and we are there to help facilitate this healing through the arts and to witness. </p>
<p>I fell in love with EXA from the moment I started this school and continue to do so with every class. I am the kind of person that has an interest in all the arts. I am particularly fascinated on it's affects on our emotions and states of being. In music school I found studying one instrument limiting since I play drums, guitar, bass and voice.  I am an artist that loves poetry, acting, drama, visual art, writing, and music. With EXA I no longer have limits and I am able to further explore and develop my fascination with the arts and it's healing effects on people.  And for the first time I feel like I know that I am exactly where I need to be- studying EXA. </p>
<p>So why do I need your help? As an international student in a private school there are very limited scholarships and even loans available to me. With student loans from my BA and living expenses in a foreign country I have been finding it very difficult to fund my tuition for this school and therefore continue my education here in Toronto.  Which is why I have to come up with creative ways to fund my education. </p>
<p>WHY SHOULD YOU HELP??</p>
<p>My dream is to make expression through the arts as available to people as a yoga class. Who needs expression through the arts? EVERYONE </p>
<p>Living a healthy lifestyle is not just about your physical body it is about your mental and emotional states as well. </p>
<p>I want to make expressing through the arts an option for people. When you're having a bad day- take an expressive arts class.</p>
<p> When you're going through a breakup- take an expressive arts class. </p>
<p>When you're having a good day and want to expand on that feeling- take an expressive arts class. </p>
<p>So I invite you to help me come closer to making this dream a reality!</p>

</div></div>","Banyan is a non-profit community center based in Bratislava, Slovakia. 
Has been opened since September 2014 as a place to provide safe and cozy environment for a self-development projects. In this short period of time we had open various yoga classes and courses, we have organized community events, seminars, group meditations.
We work also with seniors and organize three yoga courses a week specialized for them. We have classes also in English for our lovely expat community.


Banyan centrum is a ""dream come true"" project of the founder Eva Zajasenska (http://journeyofbohemian.com/), who is creating also this project to rise funds for a bigger studio.
The community is growing and our current studio with 30 m2 is too small for our activities. Still more and more people would like to join our classes, presentations, meetings and we would like to welcome them and inspire as many people as possible. 
We do not have at the moment a changing room and shower, the main room is only 20 m2. 
The bigger space would allow us to make much more interesting events. For example intuitive dance nights, music concerts, dynamic meditations etc. 
I wish to find a place in a nice central location with trees and greenery around. 
With proper changing room, place to sit before and after the events and enjoy a small chat or cup of nice tea.

We would like to organize much more free events: meditations, movie nights, community meetings etc.

The funds will help us to support one year rent. In the case we can find a good deal we would invest the rest of money to buy some basic equipment as a good quality yoga mats, meditation pillows, radio and speakers which are more then needed.

Banyan is an open community which provides  space and support beginning teachers, interesting projects, group meditations, presentations etc. 
Thank you very much for your contribution and for spreading the word about our campaign and sharing it with your friends.

Slovenská verziaBanyan je komunitné centrum zamerané na osobnostný rozvoj človeka, založené v septembri 2014 v Bratislave. 
V súčasnosti vedieme hodiny a kurzy jogy, cvičenie pre seniorov, organizujeme semináre, meditácie a cestovateľské prezentácie.Naša činnosť a členovia sa stále rozrastá a naše súčasné priestory 30m2 sú nám veľmi tesné. Touto zbierkou by sme chceli získať finančnú pomoc na prenajatie väčších priestorov, ktoré budú vhodné na našu činnosť a umožnia nám rozšíriť aktivity pre väčší počet ľudí. Rovnako nám vaše príspevky pomôžu k zakúpeniu vybavenia a pomôcok, ktoré potrebujeme.
Radi by sme v budúcnosti poskytli priestor viacerým ľuďom a projektom. Otvorili nové aktivity, ktoré si vyžadujú väčší priestor. Ako napríklad intuitívny tanec, hudobný koncert, cestovateľské prezentácie, dynamické meditácie a pod. V novom priestore by sme radi pre vás mali šatňu, sprchu, priestor na posedenie a prípadne vypitie čajíka. 
Chceli by sme organizovať viac podujatí, ktoré by boli zadarmo alebo za dobrovoľný príspevok. Ako napríklad meditácie, filmové večery, stretnutia a pod.

The meeting place that welcomes residents and neighbors. The magnet that attracts shops, restaurants, retail businesses, and commerce. The heart of our community life. The Coraopolis Train Station stands as an outstanding example of the unique Richardson Romanesque architecture. Named after famed architect Henry Hobson Richardson, this style features rounded arches, recessed entrances, and short, strong columns. This proud, distinguished structure deserves to be restored and cherished. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places by the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation in 1978. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. And it was named one of Pittsburgh’s Top Ten Best Preservation Opportunities in 2010 by the Young Preservationists Association of Pittsburgh. The Train Station’s elegant presence and historical value have long been recognized. But steps were never taken to save it.Until now.In 2008, four local couples purchased the Train Station and immediately donated it to the Coraopolis Community Development Foundation – and organization they established to oversee the Station Project as well as other community initiatives.The goal is to completely restore it, while retaining its unique character and architecture, and transform it into a multi-use community center. Because Coraopolis is the terminus of the Montour Trail, a part of the Rails to Trails network from our town to McKeesport, people walking and cycling on the trail will visit the new Train Station as a stop along their way. The station will also serve as the junction between the Ohio River and Montour Trails. In the future you'll be able to ride to Ohio and Washington DC from here.The buzz and energy from the transformed Train Station will attract more people. That in turn will generate more interest in our area and bring in more shops, retail stores, restaurants, and other businesses. This development will spur even more development. It’s the start of new growth for Coraopolis. And it all begins with the restoration and renovation of the Coraopolis Train Station. There’s new energy and a new vision of what Coraopolis can become. We need your help. We will be asking, corporations, organizations, government and foundations for financial support. What we need right now is you.Your support, your enthusiasm, and your civic pride are vital to making this project work to benefit us all. Together we can restore the historic Coraopolis Train Station, create a new and vital community center in our town, and generate new growth and development in our community.Join us! Renovating and revitalizing the Coraopolis Train Station is a big project, and it has a detailed, well-thought-out plan, with the numbers, the priorities, and the waves of progress required for reaching completion on time and on budget. We’ve already completed an engineering study to assess the structural integrity of the building, and have received designs for both the interior and exterior elements. We’ve now identified the next steps, and have broken them down into three phases.Phase One consists of the most immediate needs — new roofing.Phase Two goes deeper into the infrastructure, with items like rough carpentry, masonry, electrical, plumbing, flooring, windows, and doors. In Phase 3, we’re getting closer to completion. We’ll take care of the remaining necessities as well as the aesthetic elements, with items like finish carpentry, tiling, plaster, painting, and signage. The total cost to renovate and repurpose the Train Station is between $1,000,000 and $1.6 million. A small price, when you think about it, for the revitalization it will bring to our communities throughout Coraopolis now and in the future.You can donate any amount you choose.

<p>Knitted Knockers™ are special,

purchased the yarn and made her a pair. I've been telling friends about your
project and several have started making knockers. So far I've made 3 pairs,
purchased more yarn today so I can make more. One of the ladies just couldn't
stop crying when I gave her a pair. This is a wonderful project. Thank you
for being there. I'll keep knitting and telling ladies about you.

<h1><b>Why are
we asking for money?</b></h1>
<p>Knitted Knockers™ is currently represented in 13 states and is
filling requests and working with groups from many other countries as well.
With these funds we will expand our reach to 10 more states in the next year.
This should allow annually about 4,000 additional women to receive Knitted
Knockers™ provided from their own communities in addition to the thousands
given out online from the website.  Extra funds will be used to expand the
reach to even more states.  Ultimately the vision is to have Knitted
Knockers™ available in at least 2 communities per state in the United States
and continue to support groups in other countries where requested.  The
expectation is to accomplish this within three years.</p>
<h1><b>What are
we going to do with it?</b></h1>
<p>Dollars collected will be used to set up collection points using
a franchise model through yarn shops and various existing guilds while maintaining
quality control. Funds will be used to equip and supply distribution
points through accredited breast clinics and generate publicity to get the good
news out about Knitted Knockers™ to the hundreds of thousands of women that can
use them.</p>
<h1><b>Where do
the dollars go?</b></h1>
<p>In order to create and support
these new groups and breast clinics it will require funds for marketing,
travel, training, printed materials, supplies, postage, etc.  All labor
is <b><span>volunteer and no wages are taken for administrative purposes</span></b>.
 Booths at events such as Relay for Life, Fiber Arts Fairs, health fairs
along with TV, radio and print ads will be utilized to spread the word to
volunteer knitters who can provide them and the breast cancer survivors who can
use them.  </p>
<p>Social media sites such as
Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, Google+, and Instagram will be utilized to spread
the word.  Our website, <a href=""http://www.knittedknockers.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.knittedknockers.org</a> will continue to be a main
portal to allow women to order free Knitted Knockers™ that don't have providers
in their community as well as equip knitters to make them and shops to become
collection points.  Postage and handling costs are substantial for
providing knitted knockers through the website so any groups that can be
equipped to provide directly to their own communities saves these costs in the
long term.</p>

<h1>Risks and challenges</h1>
<p>Our risks are minimal as we have been operating for awhile
developing the model by which to connect the networks of volunteer knitters
with the breast clinics to provide free Knitted Knockers™ to the women that
need them. The largest risk we have is that as word gets out the demand will
surpass the network of volunteer knitters. The risk is minimized as there are
literally thousands of existing groups of knitters and crocheters that are
organized and ready and willing to knit ""charity"" projects.</p>
<p>The challenge is equipping them to do what they do well,
knitting, and connecting them with the medical clinics and websites for
distribution. Our model enables us to do that. Most yarn shops have these
groups operating through their stores. It is a win/win for the stores to sign
up for the program as it generates sales of yarn, traffic in the store as
knitters drop off their completed knockers, and goodwill of being associated
with such a worthwhile project.</p>
<p>We will connect with breast clinics across the country this
year to establish one distribution point per state to provide for their own
communities (about 200 knockers per community). Requests from women from areas
not yet served will be met online through the websites. With hundreds of yarn
shops in the US and around the world hearing about this great cause, we're
discovering so many are excited to participate. The expectation is that each
distribution point will provide around 200 Knitted Knockers™ per year to their
community. That’s as simple as 17 knitters making just 1 Knitted Knocker each
per month. Any excess knockers created can be sent to the national group for
distribution from our website.</p>

December while watching an Orlando, Fl news station. My husband's nephew's wife
had just been diagnosed with breast cancer. I went to my local yarn shop,
purchased the yarn and made her a pair. I've been telling friends about your
project and several have started making knockers. So far I've made 3 pairs,
purchased more yarn today so I can make more. One of the ladies just couldn't
stop crying when I gave her a pair. This is a wonderful project. Thank you
for being there. I'll keep knitting and telling ladies about you.

Why are
we asking for money?
Knitted Knockers™ is currently represented in 13 states and is
filling requests and working with groups from many other countries as well.
With these funds we will expand our reach to 10 more states in the next year.
This should allow annually about 4,000 additional women to receive Knitted
Knockers™ provided from their own communities in addition to the thousands
given out online from the website.  Extra funds will be used to expand the
reach to even more states.  Ultimately the vision is to have Knitted
Knockers™ available in at least 2 communities per state in the United States
and continue to support groups in other countries where requested.  The
expectation is to accomplish this within three years.
What are
we going to do with it?
Dollars collected will be used to set up collection points using
a franchise model through yarn shops and various existing guilds while maintaining
quality control. Funds will be used to equip and supply distribution
points through accredited breast clinics and generate publicity to get the good
news out about Knitted Knockers™ to the hundreds of thousands of women that can
use them.
Where do
the dollars go?
In order to create and support
these new groups and breast clinics it will require funds for marketing,
travel, training, printed materials, supplies, postage, etc.  All labor
is volunteer and no wages are taken for administrative purposes.
 Booths at events such as Relay for Life, Fiber Arts Fairs, health fairs
along with TV, radio and print ads will be utilized to spread the word to
volunteer knitters who can provide them and the breast cancer survivors who can
use them.  
Social media sites such as
Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, Google+, and Instagram will be utilized to spread
the word.  Our website, www.knittedknockers.org will continue to be a main
portal to allow women to order free Knitted Knockers™ that don't have providers
in their community as well as equip knitters to make them and shops to become
collection points.  Postage and handling costs are substantial for
providing knitted knockers through the website so any groups that can be
equipped to provide directly to their own communities saves these costs in the
long term.

It's a
Tax Deductible Donation!
Knitted Knockers™ Support
Foundation is a non profit 501(c(3). The Rewards have been carefully
chosen in consideration and support of breast cancer causes.  If you opt
out of the reward all or part of your gift may be tax deductible as a
charitable contribution.  Please check with your tax advisor.
Any funds received over our goal will enable us to spread the word and serve more women sooner!
 
Risks and challenges
Our risks are minimal as we have been operating for awhile
developing the model by which to connect the networks of volunteer knitters
with the breast clinics to provide free Knitted Knockers™ to the women that
need them. The largest risk we have is that as word gets out the demand will
surpass the network of volunteer knitters. The risk is minimized as there are
literally thousands of existing groups of knitters and crocheters that are
organized and ready and willing to knit ""charity"" projects.
The challenge is equipping them to do what they do well,
knitting, and connecting them with the medical clinics and websites for
distribution. Our model enables us to do that. Most yarn shops have these
groups operating through their stores. It is a win/win for the stores to sign
up for the program as it generates sales of yarn, traffic in the store as
knitters drop off their completed knockers, and goodwill of being associated
with such a worthwhile project.
We will connect with breast clinics across the country this
year to establish one distribution point per state to provide for their own
communities (about 200 knockers per community). Requests from women from areas
not yet served will be met online through the websites. With hundreds of yarn
shops in the US and around the world hearing about this great cause, we're
discovering so many are excited to participate. The expectation is that each
distribution point will provide around 200 Knitted Knockers™ per year to their
community. That’s as simple as 17 knitters making just 1 Knitted Knocker each
per month. Any excess knockers created can be sent to the national group for
distribution from our website.

is a Personal Story</h1><div>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Over the last couple of years my friends and I have spent countless hours learning
new technologies with the help of various video training courses. Working in
the IT sector keeping up to date with rapidly changing technological trends is
an absolute must. We have plenty of personal experience about the advantages
and disadvantages of using video based learning solutions.  </span><br/>
</div>
<p>One of the
issues that kept coming up in conversations was how tedious it was to take
notes and synchronize the notes with the videos. Without a link between videos
and notes going back to double check some information was tedious and impractical.
After a while we actually gave up trying. However, this hindered the learning
process and we realized we have to find a better solution. The idea of a video
player that was optimized for learning from video courses was born about a year
ago and slowly our concepts started to take form. We drew not only from our
experiences but talked to many other people and finally we put together a list
with most prevalent problems and recommendations for their solutions. These
solutions form the core functionality of the MoocPlayer software.</p><p><br/></p>
<h1>The Problem with Video Players</h1><div><br/></div>
<p></p><ul>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Existing
video players are designed for watching movies and TV shows and listening to
music. In these cases having to pause and start the video multiple times is a
rare occurrence. When learning from video trainings you will have to stop the
video several times to memorize some  piece of information, try out some solution
recommended in the video or take some notes. Having to continuously push pause
and play become tedious very fast.<br/><br/></span></li>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">It’s
often difficult to decide where to store your notes. You can write notes on
paper, in a document on your computer or you can use some online note taking
solution. In none of these cases will the notes be linked with the specific
video they relate to and especially not to the place in the video from where
the information originated. This makes rechecking information extremely inconvenient
especially if you watched hundreds of training videos.<br/><br/></span></li>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Typically
video training courses contain very dense educational material. The seconds you
lose pressing pause and play or when you simultaneously try listening and
taking notes can easily translate into missed information.<br/><br/></span></li>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><p>A
picture is worth a thousand words. Sometimes saving a screenshot of the video
frame is an incredibly useful way of capturing information. Normally each
screenshot requires several additional steps and organizing them in any
meaningful way is a cause for headache.</p></span></li>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Wouldn’t
you like a clearly structured, standardized summary of your notes?  A summary where the different types of
information in your notes are aggregated. Wouldn’t it be great for example if
you had a collection of all Photoshop keyboard shortcuts you learned about?<br/><br/></span></li>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Video
training courses typically contain a large number of video files organized into
chapters. Making a playlist that takes into consideration the chapter structure
is not supported by popular video players. All the videos will be dumped into
one simple list. This presents an especially frustrating problem when videos
are numbered similarly in every chapter and thus the order is messed up.<br/><br/></span></li>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">There
is an abundance of amazing training videos and tutorials on YouTube. Wouldn’t
it be great to create a playlist in your video player from YouTube videos or to
import an existing YouTube playlist? <br/><br/></span></li>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Have
you ever managed to remember where you left off yesterday with your video
course? We have lost count of how many time we have skipped videos or watched a
video repeatedly. This is particularly a problem when you watch multiple
courses simultaneously.<br/><br/></span></li>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Wouldn’t
it be great if you could create your own knowledge base from all the video
courses you watched and all the notes and screenshots you took making any
information easily retrievable in a structured context?</span></li>

<p>MoocPlayer is a publisher independent video player that offers a quick and
easy solution to all of the problems listed above. </p>

video automatically pauses and starts again when you start typing or press

<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">You can take notes directly in the application and all
notes are linked to the specific video frame where the video was paused. Going
back to re-watch the video segment is extremely easy, just click on the note
inside the program.<br/><br/></span></li>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">With seamless note

<h1>Help the World Get the Most Out
of Video Courses</h1>
<p>In the
beginning we just wanted to make learning from video trainings a better experience
for ourselves, but along the way, we realized that millions of people have the
same problems as we do. It dawned on us that MoocPlayer could actually be the solution
the world has been waiting for…. well the part of the world that watches video
courses anyway. We have great ambitions and the knowledge to develop a truly
exceptional video player optimized for video courses but we will need your help. <br/></p><p>We will be more than grateful if you can make a financial contribution to our
efforts but getting the word out about MoocPayer or sending us feedback also
goes a long way. With your help MoocPlayer can become a reality.  </p><br/></div>","This
is a Personal Story
Over the last couple of years my friends and I have spent countless hours learning
new technologies with the help of various video training courses. Working in
the IT sector keeping up to date with rapidly changing technological trends is
an absolute must. We have plenty of personal experience about the advantages
and disadvantages of using video based learning solutions.  

One of the
issues that kept coming up in conversations was how tedious it was to take
notes and synchronize the notes with the videos. Without a link between videos
and notes going back to double check some information was tedious and impractical.
After a while we actually gave up trying. However, this hindered the learning
process and we realized we have to find a better solution. The idea of a video
player that was optimized for learning from video courses was born about a year
ago and slowly our concepts started to take form. We drew not only from our
experiences but talked to many other people and finally we put together a list
with most prevalent problems and recommendations for their solutions. These
solutions form the core functionality of the MoocPlayer software.
The Problem with Video Players

Existing
video players are designed for watching movies and TV shows and listening to
music. In these cases having to pause and start the video multiple times is a
rare occurrence. When learning from video trainings you will have to stop the
video several times to memorize some  piece of information, try out some solution
recommended in the video or take some notes. Having to continuously push pause
and play become tedious very fast.
It’s
often difficult to decide where to store your notes. You can write notes on
paper, in a document on your computer or you can use some online note taking
solution. In none of these cases will the notes be linked with the specific
video they relate to and especially not to the place in the video from where
the information originated. This makes rechecking information extremely inconvenient
especially if you watched hundreds of training videos.
Typically
video training courses contain very dense educational material. The seconds you
lose pressing pause and play or when you simultaneously try listening and
taking notes can easily translate into missed information.
A
picture is worth a thousand words. Sometimes saving a screenshot of the video
frame is an incredibly useful way of capturing information. Normally each
screenshot requires several additional steps and organizing them in any
meaningful way is a cause for headache.
Wouldn’t
you like a clearly structured, standardized summary of your notes?  A summary where the different types of
information in your notes are aggregated. Wouldn’t it be great for example if
you had a collection of all Photoshop keyboard shortcuts you learned about?
Video
training courses typically contain a large number of video files organized into
chapters. Making a playlist that takes into consideration the chapter structure
is not supported by popular video players. All the videos will be dumped into
one simple list. This presents an especially frustrating problem when videos
are numbered similarly in every chapter and thus the order is messed up.
There
is an abundance of amazing training videos and tutorials on YouTube. Wouldn’t
it be great to create a playlist in your video player from YouTube videos or to
import an existing YouTube playlist? 
Have
you ever managed to remember where you left off yesterday with your video
course? We have lost count of how many time we have skipped videos or watched a
video repeatedly. This is particularly a problem when you watch multiple
courses simultaneously.
Wouldn’t
it be great if you could create your own knowledge base from all the video
courses you watched and all the notes and screenshots you took making any
information easily retrievable in a structured context?

What MoocPlayer Offers
MoocPlayer is a publisher independent video player that offers a quick and
easy solution to all of the problems listed above. 

MoocPlayer makes note taking a seamless experience. The
video automatically pauses and starts again when you start typing or press
Enter.
You can take notes directly in the application and all
notes are linked to the specific video frame where the video was paused. Going
back to re-watch the video segment is extremely easy, just click on the note
inside the program.
With seamless note
taking there are no lost seconds and so you will not miss out on any important
piece of information.
Every time you add a note, a screenshot is attached
automatically.
With just one click a summary of your notes will be
generated. You will get a simple structured overview of the notes you took, a
summary of your comments, keyboard shortcuts, resources, and questions.
MoocPlayer generates a playlist that keeps the chapter
structure of the video training course intact, videos will always be in the
right order. MoocPlayer also keeps track of your progress, displaying where you
are in the given chapter and also the entire video course.
Adding YouTube videos to your playlist is simple in
MoocPlayer, in fact, whole YouTube playlists can be added with just a few
clicks.
MoocPlayer automatically remembers where you left each
of your video training courses.
The exported training related notes and screenshots
are organized into a structured knowledge base you can always come back to.
Our ProgressSince last fall our team has been working tirelessly to design the system
architecture and to develop a working prototype of MoocPlayer. We have made
significant progress and the first alfa version is already running on our
machines. However there are a lot of things to do before we can
publish the final product. We still need to improve usability, add
features, fix bugs and package it in a way that we have a simple downloadable
and installable product. There is a lot to do and we can’t do it alone.RoadmapPrototypeHere are some screenshots of the actual prototype of MoocPlayer:



What We Need

The total development costs of MoocPlayer are far higher than the requested
amount. Until now we have financed the project from our own savings but our
resources have been exhausted. We are very enthusiastic and we believe that
MoocPlayer will be a game changer in how we learn from video trainings, but we
need your support in realizing our dream.  

The biggest part of the requested funds will be spent on further development
and testing. We would also like to integrate some state of art 3rd
party component into our software and for this we will have to purchase their licenses.
Finally, we need some money for design and marketing purposes as well.

The Team
We are a handful of IT guys with many years of experience under our belts
and an ongoing passion for innovation. We have worked for companies like Verizon,
T-Mobile, Siemens, HBO, McDonald’s, Hertz to name a few. We also have a design
expert on our team to make sure things look great.

Help the World Get the Most Out
of Video Courses
In the
beginning we just wanted to make learning from video trainings a better experience
for ourselves, but along the way, we realized that millions of people have the
same problems as we do. It dawned on us that MoocPlayer could actually be the solution
the world has been waiting for…. well the part of the world that watches video
courses anyway. We have great ambitions and the knowledge to develop a truly
exceptional video player optimized for video courses but we will need your help. We will be more than grateful if you can make a financial contribution to our
efforts but getting the word out about MoocPayer or sending us feedback also
goes a long way. With your help MoocPlayer can become a reality.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p><p>Hello Contributor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I teach at a low income (Title 1) school highly populated with English as a second language learners. We are struggling to progress with the newly required standards. I have been researching (through a technology grant) resources to advance the success of my students using iPads. My class is a 1-1 iPad class. I found several apps (listed below) that test and manage each student's progress toward standard mastery. This is computer generated and managed. This allows each student to work on missing skills while advancing at their best possible rate. In effect, this creates an individualized learning plan for each student while moving forward at a rate that responds to that particular student. Then, the parents and I get a report which allows me to focus that student on areas of need. Math, reading, science, social studies, and language arts issues are all tracked. Some of the apps allow for lesson creation and delivery along with other teacher created lessons addressing the standards. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My students will be working in the environment that is required for current Common Core testing (SBAC). They are using the iPad to work out math problems, type answers for reading response questions or explanations for problem procedures and more. This will allow them to have the best preparation for testing. Typing issues or iPad responses through touch are constantly being addressed and improved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My students have shown genuine improvement on standards using these apps to date. I am happy with the reports showing progress and areas of needed improvement for each student, and parents are pleased with current reporting on their students progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Teachers are currently struggling to account for the different standards due to limited access to appropriate materials and delineating different standards addressed in layered questions in current testing materials. These apps specify progress on all of the standards in great specificity.</p>
