</div><p></p><p> Hello, dear sir or madam! </p><p> My name is Anna Litvinova and I'm 20, from Odessa! If I had only one word to describe myself, I'd say: ""I'm an artist"". I've been painting since I was 10 and cannot imagine myself without art. I graduated form art school and now I'm studying at a university. I also had two personal art exhibitions in my city. You can see my pictures on my website and leave your comments. Every day of my life I dedicate to painting and people’s fun is the best reward for me.</p><p> But it's only one side of me, the other one is a serious genetic disease. My diagnosis is spinal-muscular atrophy (SMA). My muscles are too weak. I could never stand and walk. Also, I can’t seat and even lift my hands without help. My muscles can’t support my spine. Because of it the scoliosis is developing every single day. My spine presses on my internal organs; first on my heart and then lungs. It is very dangerous. Moreover, now I can’t seat more than an hour a day without having awful pain in the back, which does not stop during the day. That’s why I can't paint as much as I want and my dream is getting far from me.</p><p> But nothing can stop me as well as my dream. I love my life very much and don't pay attention to the difficulties. Every day I ask my parents to help me with painting. They give me brushes and colors, help me to seat. When I'm tired and feel pain I continue to paint lying flat on my back. When I can't pick my hand high enough I turn the canvas upside down. In any case, I will find the way out!</p><p> Of course art is not all what I do. I'm also fond of foreign languages. Now I'm studying English, Chineese and Italian. So I can speak 5 languages including my native ones: Russian and Ukrainian. Also I have a lot of friends and acquaintances with whom I spend my free time by speaking and walking. But art is my lifetime project. And it is really difficult to study and to paint when pain and constrained movements bother me all the time.</p><p> I need a surgery for correction of my spine. Doctors claim that I need it urgently. After this surgery the special titanium construction will support my spine instead of weak muscles, the scoliosis will stop developing, and I won't feel pain any more. It is possible to have a surgery in Finland’s hospital ORTON. The surgery costs 42 000 euros. Unfortunately, my family hasn’t got such money. My parents’ salary isn't big. Because of the political situation in Ukraine it's getting more difficult to earn money in my country. We’ve been getting money for one year and a half and now we have only collected a tiny part of it. So, we are in despair.</p><p> This surgery is the expansion my freedom’s limits. After this surgery I will live without any fear and pain, also I will be able to do what I like more.</p><p> So, I am a desperate girl who has hope which costs too much.</p><p> I'm begging you for supporting my effort to have enough money for my surgery.

<p>My name is Andrew Wyllie, and I am the CTO &amp; Founder of NU Frontier Communications. My wife Mahta Sattar has stage IV breast cancer, and my mother in law Ashie Karab has pancreatic cancer. This project is dedicated to their health, as well as the health of many other Canadians affected by Cancer.</p>
<p>In Canada, our medicare system is ""aging badly"", and ""major renovation"" is due, according to the recently released <a href=""http://bit.ly/1fprXgn"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Naylor report</a>. In recent years, both the Quebec and Ontario governments have spent a combined $2.6 billion on the development of an Electronic Health Record system, resulting, unfortunately, in a minimally viable product.</p>
<p>It is time for an organization to take the lead and use a grassroots approach in order to help those affected by cancer; that is why my organization is developing this portal. The goal is to develop a one-stop location containing all of the patients' medical data, available and clearly explained, to assist them along their journey. The solution is one that is patient-centered, allowing the patients to fully understand their historic information, vital signs, lab results, etc., and empower them to make a decision with the input of their chosen specialists.</p>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>Currently the system is set up in such a way that it is not patient friendly. If my wife has a CT Scan in a private hospital that is not directly connected to the public network significant delays occur with obtaining results. This leads to unnecessary anxiety for the patient.

<div>How great would it be to have all of your physician notes in a central location? What about your blood tests? How about a graph that plotted your weight over the course of time? </div>
<div>All of this is possible with technology based solutions. Unfortunately the lack of open standards promoted by government, lack of collaboration between technology solution providers within the industry, has lead to disjointed and siloed solutions.  The end result is the patients' data is scattered and not centralized, leading to tremendous difficulty to proactively monitor the patients' health. You however can help make a change for the better.</div>

<p>There are many IT organizations that currently work with public and private healthcare facilities. We are going to need to work in collaboration with these organizations in order to integrate data into the patient portal solution for cancer patients. We do anticipate some resistance but we fully believe we can reach agreements and demonstrate that it is for the benefit of the patient.</p>
<p>Unlike the US, there currently isn't any adoption of standards in Canada to develop an open architecture framework for data. The US has an incentive based program called meaningful use to promote collaboration amongst solution providers for the benefit of the patients.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p><strong>Greetings!</strong><br/>My name is Maxine Iharosy and <strong>I'm shaking-in-my-boots excited</strong> about receiving an acceptance call to<a href=""http://shakti-initiation.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Shakti Initiation: an all female 500 hour Women's Leadership &amp; Yoga Training</a>, which takes place officially beginning in September with weekly calls to discuss assignments and readings prior to the immersion. The <em>month-long training immersion</em> itself takes place in <em><em>Bali in February of 2016</em></em>. The program is facilitated by the incredibly skilled teaching team of <strong>Jovinna Chan &amp; Grace Jull</strong>, both of whom were guiding lights for me during my initial <strong>200 hour Yoga Teacher Training at Kripalu, in Massachusetts.</strong> Jovinna for her enthusiasm for moving through the world with awareness and awe, and Grace for her ever-flowing insights in anatomy, science, and the great mysteries of it all.</p><p><br/><strong>Who Am I, Really?</strong><br/><em><em><em><em><em>I've been living in the Owen Sound area all my life and now I feel it's time for me to give back</em></em></em></em></em>. By taking this training<strong> I will be equipped to reach out to women-at-risk and unite women within the community by facilitating programs intended to develop independence, self-esteem, and empathy for one another</strong>. I've been teaching Yoga here for over four years, and my passion for teaching the art of skillful living through Yoga, and studying the origins, philosophy, and modern applicability is a never ending quest for me. <br/><br/> I grow herbs and vegetables to sustain a small market garden, I walk with awareness along forest trails, I have a deep reverence for Mother Nature and by doing so,<strong> I advocate for supporting the Divine Feminine (Shakti).</strong> It's my vision to participate fully in my community on behalf of celebrating our human lineage in a kind, gentle, giving-back-to-the-land kind of way, recognizing with humbleness the power we have at our disposal. I believe starting with the compassionate study of ourselves, our morals, our way of living, comes first.<em> But how does one get to that place of compassionate self-study?<br/>Practice, practice, practice.<br/><br/><strong><em>The
Work I Do.</em><br/><em>
</em>And Why I need the Financial Support.<br/></strong></em><em>I
teach Yoga (and grow vegetables) because I can’t imagine anything I’d rather
do. I love eating well, working hard, collaborating with others, being outside,
being in my body, supporting the inward journey of others &amp; feeling alive. I
don’t even mind swimming against the current- I’ve don’t it all my life. It
might seem like more work sometimes, but in all truth it’s much easier to find real
nourishment if you’re facing upstream.

<strong><i>I wish to recognize fully
the trauma that is the result of our way of living in our world while
still being capable of having an active force in healing and
reconciliation between human, and environment. To me this has a great deal to
do with supporting equality for all and embracing a shift of
perspective in  recognizing our ancestral ties to
the natural world as necessary for our holistic survival .That is why I teach,
that is why I grow food. That is why for me they are united ways of being.</i></strong>
<strong><br/>
</strong>In the end it is all worth it for me.<br/><br/><strong>I have my financial goal set at $5,500- I'm not set on receiving that (though of course that would  be extremely generous support and amazing). I want to reassure that anything I receive is support enough, that I am grateful for whatever it is that comes my way.</strong><br/>
......<br/>
So I’m asking for support to do this training because I need the help so I can
continue to do what I do and deepen my studies. I’m reaching out and you don’t
have to reach back, but if you do I’m eternally grateful. <strong>Even if all you can

So much grace, light, and love to you for reading. <br/>
May you step softly and sweetly ever closer to your inner truth. .<br/></strong><br/></em><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p></p></div>","Greetings!My name is Maxine Iharosy and I'm shaking-in-my-boots excited about receiving an acceptance call to Shakti Initiation: an all female 500 hour Women's Leadership & Yoga Training, which takes place officially beginning in September with weekly calls to discuss assignments and readings prior to the immersion. The month-long training immersion itself takes place in Bali in February of 2016. The program is facilitated by the incredibly skilled teaching team of Jovinna Chan & Grace Jull, both of whom were guiding lights for me during my initial 200 hour Yoga Teacher Training at Kripalu, in Massachusetts. Jovinna for her enthusiasm for moving through the world with awareness and awe, and Grace for her ever-flowing insights in anatomy, science, and the great mysteries of it all.Who Am I, Really?I've been living in the Owen Sound area all my life and now I feel it's time for me to give back. By taking this training I will be equipped to reach out to women-at-risk and unite women within the community by facilitating programs intended to develop independence, self-esteem, and empathy for one another. I've been teaching Yoga here for over four years, and my passion for teaching the art of skillful living through Yoga, and studying the origins, philosophy, and modern applicability is a never ending quest for me.  I grow herbs and vegetables to sustain a small market garden, I walk with awareness along forest trails, I have a deep reverence for Mother Nature and by doing so, I advocate for supporting the Divine Feminine (Shakti). It's my vision to participate fully in my community on behalf of celebrating our human lineage in a kind, gentle, giving-back-to-the-land kind of way, recognizing with humbleness the power we have at our disposal. I believe starting with the compassionate study of ourselves, our morals, our way of living, comes first. But how does one get to that place of compassionate self-study?Practice, practice, practice.The
Work I Do.
And Why I need the Financial Support.I
teach Yoga (and grow vegetables) because I can’t imagine anything I’d rather
do. I love eating well, working hard, collaborating with others, being outside,
being in my body, supporting the inward journey of others & feeling alive. I
don’t even mind swimming against the current- I’ve don’t it all my life. It
might seem like more work sometimes, but in all truth it’s much easier to find real
nourishment if you’re facing upstream.

I wish to recognize fully
the trauma that is the result of our way of living in our world while
still being capable of having an active force in healing and
reconciliation between human, and environment. To me this has a great deal to
do with supporting equality for all and embracing a shift of
perspective in  recognizing our ancestral ties to
the natural world as necessary for our holistic survival .That is why I teach,
that is why I grow food. That is why for me they are united ways of being.

In the end it is all worth it for me.I have my financial goal set at $5,500- I'm not set on receiving that (though of course that would  be extremely generous support and amazing). I want to reassure that anything I receive is support enough, that I am grateful for whatever it is that comes my way.
......
So I’m asking for support to do this training because I need the help so I can
continue to do what I do and deepen my studies. I’m reaching out and you don’t
have to reach back, but if you do I’m eternally grateful. Even if all you can
extend is a smile, and to pass this along to anyone you think may be interested
in investing in the support. For those who know me, they know of me as being one who works very hard, who is generous with my time and input to the causes of others.

<h1>You have a busy life!</h1>
<p>So do I and I can't wait to use Rambly myself!   As the lead of a top notch Website Development team, mother of three, and serial entrepreneur,  my day is literally all over the map!  I need more than just a list of appointments.  I need a smart tool that knows where I am, where I am going, when I am going to be late, and what would be helpful for me to know is in the area.  The Rambly app will do all of these things and more. </p>
<h2>How Rambly Works</h2>
<p>Rambly will pull in your e-calendar to plot your day's appointments onto a colorful map, draw a line to trace your optimal route, and then help you navigate through the day, keep you in contact with people you are meeting, and will allow small local business owners to invite you in to their shops if you are passing by.  You can drop a pin onto the map to add an appointment, and keep a running to do list that is location based.</p>

<br/><br/>
<div>We are challenging the Groupon and steep discount model that can actually hurt a small business.  Rather than getting offer takers who who may never return, shops can reach folks who are actually in the area, and reward them for stopping in, giving both the customer and the business the opportunity to build a relationship.  Additionally shops will know generally when a customer plans to come in, rather than have an unknown time period of two months, making it very difficult to plan what supplies or resources are needed.  Rather than offering discounts, which we certainly all needed during the economic downturn, businesses can instead offer perks and gifts, such as an extra donut or a bottle of champagne with dinner!</div>

<h1>Why support Rambly?</h1>
<p>""Mr. Wonderful"" of Shark Tank recently learned that all of the businesses he had invested in that were profitable are led by women.  He was shocked!  We aren't.  Nope!  Because women in general have to be extremely resourceful with their time and resources due to family management responsibilities.  We  typically tackle only problems that we feel confident we can solve, and when we go for it, we are all in.  That is me.  Every minute I am spending on Rambly I am NOT spending time with my kids, and I intend to not let that lost time with them go to waste. I intend to bring Rambly to market, and to introduce a woman's solution to time management, and a more relationship and reward-based promotional alternative to connect locally owned businesses with their community.</p>

<p>To me the word rambly evokes the feeling of a warm summer wind blowing in through the window of an old rusty pick-up truck meandering down a dirt road in rural Minnesota where I grew up.  It is the sound of tires on a bumpy road, the passing of time as a natural rhythm, waiting for the corn to grow and the cows to come home.  Pausing for a moment to look over a vast field of prairie grass waving in the wind feels very similar to standing and looking out at the ocean as the waves roll in, one after the other.  This rusty pin icon represents that time of waiting, of giving up control and allowing ourselves to become a part of our surroundings rather than trying to change them.</p>

<p>A message from Wendy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""Our brains can only focus on one thing at a time.  We are never really multi-tasking, we are just switching rapidly from one thought or task to the next.  Our brains do not enjoy or improve when we do this.  In fact, studies have shown that it actually reduces our ability to focus.  Anyone who runs a business, a household, or even a busy personal life knows how challenging it can be to wade through the basic tasks required to function in our fast moving world.  So many of these tasks can be automated.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119);"">We all have generally the same basic needs: sleep, eat, school, work, go to the dentist, doctor, barber or salon, and myriad common errands.  If you are a parent, you are also managing all of these for multiple people.  Why not build an assistant who already knows this, and can manage these tasks for us?  As a community you will help us write and automate those practical reminders that will keep us functioning, healthy, safe, and joyful.""</span><br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>We are excited about bringing Rambly to the world, and the ease that it will bring to our lives, especially those who are juggling families or busy travel schedules.  We would love your help!</span><br/></p>

We are challenging the Groupon and steep discount model that can actually hurt a small business.  Rather than getting offer takers who who may never return, shops can reach folks who are actually in the area, and reward them for stopping in, giving both the customer and the business the opportunity to build a relationship.  Additionally shops will know generally when a customer plans to come in, rather than have an unknown time period of two months, making it very difficult to plan what supplies or resources are needed.  Rather than offering discounts, which we certainly all needed during the economic downturn, businesses can instead offer perks and gifts, such as an extra donut or a bottle of champagne with dinner!

Our hand-crafted algorithm will only show offers on your daily map that are near by, or that make sense based on your schedule.  You can receive spontaneous offerings from neighborhood shops who will be enticing you to ""ramble on in"".

Do you drive kids around all day? Since school busses have gone the way of the dinosaur, parents find themselves driving all day long taking their kids to and from schools and events. We will pause our regular program, and present this song for your entertainment.  I stopped into a music store to buy a guitar pick for my son and walked out with a ukelele.  Pretty good sales people at Bananas At Large in San Rafael, CA, especially considering I havent played an instrument since fifth grade.   Consequently I had to come up with a song, and this is what happened.  

To succeed in life, you need three things:  a wishbone, a backbone, and a funny bone.""      Reba McEntire 





Why support Rambly?
""Mr. Wonderful"" of Shark Tank recently learned that all of the businesses he had invested in that were profitable are led by women.  He was shocked!  We aren't.  Nope!  Because women in general have to be extremely resourceful with their time and resources due to family management responsibilities.  We  typically tackle only problems that we feel confident we can solve, and when we go for it, we are all in.  That is me.  Every minute I am spending on Rambly I am NOT spending time with my kids, and I intend to not let that lost time with them go to waste. I intend to bring Rambly to market, and to introduce a woman's solution to time management, and a more relationship and reward-based promotional alternative to connect locally owned businesses with their community.

Support girls in tech!  $25
Rambly is woman founded, owned, and invented.    The number of women in tech is dwindling.  It's no wonder!  I have been asked many times who my technical lead is.  ""uh...I am"" I reply.  A techie doesn't need to be a 20 something guy in slouchy jeans.  A Techie can be a mom with a ukelele and a mini-van!  We need young women to jump in, and to bring the world their amazing ideas that will change our future!  You can make a difference!  Help fund Rambly, and at the same time support emerging women and girls in technology around the globe.  We have created this super cool version of our beanie to represent our dedication to getting more girls in tech and also to be their inventive selves. If you choose this beanie perk, we will donate $2 to Girls Who Code (https://www.girlswhocode.com/) plus send you this cool beanie!

Rambly T-shirts with rusty icon - $25

To me the word rambly evokes the feeling of a warm summer wind blowing in through the window of an old rusty pick-up truck meandering down a dirt road in rural Minnesota where I grew up.  It is the sound of tires on a bumpy road, the passing of time as a natural rhythm, waiting for the corn to grow and the cows to come home.  Pausing for a moment to look over a vast field of prairie grass waving in the wind feels very similar to standing and looking out at the ocean as the waves roll in, one after the other.  This rusty pin icon represents that time of waiting, of giving up control and allowing ourselves to become a part of our surroundings rather than trying to change them.

Give a gift to your favorite local businesses!
If you make any contribution, you can gift a year of the Rambly Ultimate Perks Premium  Account to three of your favorite local businesses (a $5,000 value).  We will provide them with free premium offer publishing for an entire year!  Standard perks accounts will be just $100 per month.  We are committed to leveling the playing field for small businesses.  We want to support businesses owned by individuals and families. 




Rambly's Impact



 Rambly will be a game changer in the possibilities it will open in mobile apps, and you can be a part of that.  We will use the funds raised to build Rambly and to promote it to the wider public.  Using a map to navigate through our schedules will open up endless possibilities.  You will be able to search through your calendar for photos geographically, or set up a romantic date with someone crossing your path while accepting a perk from a local restaurant such as a candle lit private table.  Airlines will recognize that you need a flight, and can compete for your purchase.  You can subscribe to public calendars and see that your favorite band is having a concert when you look at your map for the weekend.  We know that you also will also be coming up with amazing ways to use Rambly and we want to make those ideas come to life!


A Mother Venture
""By now we have all heard how hard it is for woman-led ventures to acquire funding.  You can help me beat the odds, and be a part of the launching of a disruptive technology that turns our phones into true personal assistants, and our cars into polite, intuitive chauffeurs.""
Wendy

 
  Our Team We live in the Bay Area, and have been surrounded by the start-up environment for a long time.  Our team is comprised of senior level tech professionals.   Rambly is the concept of our founder, Wendy Louise Nog, MSTM, a serial entrepreneur, adventurer, and proud mom of three.  Her vision is to use Rambly not only for day-to-day navigation and planning, but also for planning weekend trips such as a Farm Tasting tour in the countryside.  Wendy has more than 15 years of experience working in the online and mobile environment.  She knows what it is like to juggle schedules, and to try to find an address buried in an e-mail while driving down the freeway.  Wendy is passionate about supporting the small business community that she loves. 
A message from Wendy:

""Our brains can only focus on one thing at a time.  We are never really multi-tasking, we are just switching rapidly from one thought or task to the next.  Our brains do not enjoy or improve when we do this.  In fact, studies have shown that it actually reduces our ability to focus.  Anyone who runs a business, a household, or even a busy personal life knows how challenging it can be to wade through the basic tasks required to function in our fast moving world.  So many of these tasks can be automated.
We all have generally the same basic needs: sleep, eat, school, work, go to the dentist, doctor, barber or salon, and myriad common errands.  If you are a parent, you are also managing all of these for multiple people.  Why not build an assistant who already knows this, and can manage these tasks for us?  As a community you will help us write and automate those practical reminders that will keep us functioning, healthy, safe, and joyful.""

We are excited about bringing Rambly to the world, and the ease that it will bring to our lives, especially those who are juggling families or busy travel schedules.  We would love your help!

</div><div><b>Cling Film </b></div><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Out of all the kitchen wrapping products in your kitchen arsenal, none are used more than cling film. The catering industry alone uses thousands of tonnes of the product when transporting tasty treats across town, and to preserve food in the fridge or freezer. So surely, if this product is used in most kitchens, it can't be all that bad, can it? </p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Plastics, poisons and pollution</b><br/>The mining, transporting and distilling of crude oil for the manufacture of plastic products comes with a heavy environmental price tag, including soil, water and air pollution. Plastic wrap has mostly been made from polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC) or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) - both products of crude oil. These chemicals are dangerously poisonous during production, use and incineration. Many of these toxic liquids, solids and gases escape into the environment, causing severe disruptions to natural systems. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Furthermore, both PVDC and PVC plastics are fairly rigid, so manufacturers generally add in softening chemicals called phthalates, which are known to cause hormonal disruption and developmental problems, and have been found to drift into food and the environment. These are just some of the health implications.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Disposal</b><br/>Most plastic wraps are not recyclable, so they get sent to the landfill or incinerator, where toxins from the plastics can leach into soil and water, disrupting ecosystem health. When burnt, poisonous gases are released into the air. </p><p><br/></p><p><b>THE HONEYBEE WRAP - NATURE'S WAY IN OUR MODERN DAY! </b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433073805/sqlah9unbb3aykdnqaxy.tiff"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433071353/df2unm8xz3jpotchujkq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>ORGANIC COTTON.</b></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Many people consider cotton to be one of the purest fibres on earth.

No more plastic wrap.
We have created an organic safe and reusable natural alternative to plastic wrap.
No chemicals, only local bees wax from the farm, certified organic cotton, jojoba oil, tree resin and love. 
Ideal for wrapping fruit and veggies, covering a bowl and wrapping lunches, this unique formula seals in the goodness, keeping your food fresh for longer. No more limp celery and shallots, just beautifully kept fresh crisp veggies and herbs. Can also  be used for storing bread and as a fermenter's friend it's perfect for covering Kombucha,  Kefir and fermented foods .
Use the warmth of your hands to mold and shape your wrap over food and dishes. The wrap will stick to itself when you press firmly over a bowl or plate. When stored in the fridge the beeswax will harden, helping retain the shape. With due care your Honeybee wrap will last up to one year and at the end of its life you can give it back to the earth.  Yes it's compostable!
Bees wax has been used for centuries for its persevering properties, along with jojoba oil which has known antibacterial and anti-fungal properties. Together they create a beautiful preserving infusion.
Eco-friendly, sustainable, waste free food storage .
Honeybee wrap the natural alternative.


WE WANT YOU TO BE PART OF THIS .
Your contributions will be used for:
*  Sourcing design and printing our own GOTS certified organic cotton range,
    Printing in bulk reduces the cost of manufacturing. Help us get the wraps out on a    global scale so every household can afford to have some. $30,000 minim print          run.
*  To upgrade our waxing equipment and tools $2,000
* Packaging  die cut boxes designed printed and cut for Shop counter displays              $4000
* Relocate to a commercial space to enable the production of the wraps on a global    scale $4,000

The impact of a reusable Beeswax wrap.


using a beeswax wrap instead of plastic wrap will have a huge impact on our earth. It is estimated Australians send 1 million tonnes of plastic waste to landfill each year. Do your part to make a change. 
Why use something for a few seconds that is going to spend the rest of your life trying to break down in landfill? We really need to change our habits.




Plastic waste can take more than 1,000 years to degrade and it is estimated that 10% of the plastic produced worldwide each year ends up in our oceans.
Schools worldwide are implementing programmes such as Nude your food and  Plastic free Tuesdays. 
 Educating children on the importance of this is a must for the future.




We want you to be part of the movement to eliminate plastic from our kitchens.
Why use toxic plastic wrap and create more landfill, when there is a safer natural way for the future?
Bee part of the reusable movement - reuse, recycle, rethink.
Honeybee wrap would like to offer all our supporters a special edition print to mark the day you were part of the movement to remove plastic from our kitchens.


   Honeybee wrap vs plastic wrap!
Cling Film Out of all the kitchen wrapping products in your kitchen arsenal, none are used more than cling film. The catering industry alone uses thousands of tonnes of the product when transporting tasty treats across town, and to preserve food in the fridge or freezer. So surely, if this product is used in most kitchens, it can't be all that bad, can it? Plastics, poisons and pollutionThe mining, transporting and distilling of crude oil for the manufacture of plastic products comes with a heavy environmental price tag, including soil, water and air pollution. Plastic wrap has mostly been made from polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC) or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) - both products of crude oil. These chemicals are dangerously poisonous during production, use and incineration. Many of these toxic liquids, solids and gases escape into the environment, causing severe disruptions to natural systems. Furthermore, both PVDC and PVC plastics are fairly rigid, so manufacturers generally add in softening chemicals called phthalates, which are known to cause hormonal disruption and developmental problems, and have been found to drift into food and the environment. These are just some of the health implications.DisposalMost plastic wraps are not recyclable, so they get sent to the landfill or incinerator, where toxins from the plastics can leach into soil and water, disrupting ecosystem health. When burnt, poisonous gases are released into the air. THE HONEYBEE WRAP - NATURE'S WAY IN OUR MODERN DAY! ORGANIC COTTON.Many people consider cotton to be one of the purest fibres on earth. When in fact, traditional chemical cotton cultivation inflicts a heavy toll on the environment. The good news is, there are now some 50 countries commercially farming cotton organically including India, Turkey, The USA, Australia, Peru and China, amongst others.Organic farming means using ancient cotton farming knowledge combined with modern technology to create a sustainable and healthy crop. Farmers replace chemical use with methods approved by organic certifying bodies, such as SKAL (Holland), BFA Australia, AGRECO (Germany) & IMO China. These certified methods minimise the impact on the soil and water supplies and preserve the Earth for future generations.These methods include things like:
Eliminating the use of synthetic fertilizers and using animal manures instead.
Eliminating the use of chemical pesticides and herbicides from every step of the farming process and using cow urine as an insecticide which is harmless to the environment.
Hand weeding
Introducing good bugs to eat up the bad ones.
Organic cotton farming uses 50% less water than chemical farming.
Allowing the plant to defoliate naturally whilst the farmers have a holiday instead of using nasty chemical defoliants.
Letting the soil recover naturally after harvest.


BEESWAX  - A natural gift from the bees - natures best.
For thousands of years, beeswax has had a wide variety of applications. It has been found in the tombs of Egypt, in wrecked Viking ships, and in Roman ruins. Beeswax never goes bad and can be heated and reused. Beeswax also has  antibiotic and thermo-storing properties.

JOJOBA -  Liquid produced in the seed of the Simmondsia chinensis (jojoba  plant) a shrub which is native to southern Arizona, southern California, and northwestern Mexico. Jojoba oil has anti-fungal properties.
TREE RESIN - Natural safe and non toxic sap from the tree.These three ingredients create the perfect blend to infuse the cotton, resulting in a flexible, malleable product that can be molded around your food.




Risks & Challenges Since we began selling the Honeybee Wrap at the local markets, cafés and health food stores, the response has been amazing. Positive feedback from happy customers talking about us on social media and sharing  photos of their wraps in use, only goes to show they are really loving our concept. 
The Kitchen Starter Pack, a pack of 3 mixed sizes and the Kitchen Collection Pack, a set of 4 mixed sizes, and a range of single sizes are available.
Keeping up the demand in the initial stages of production will prove to be challenging, but with the right equipment and correct facility we will endeavour to do this as quickly as possible. We are expecting a rapid growth and worldwide demand for the Honeybee Wrap™
DELIVERY... It is estimated it will take up to three months to implement the designing and printing of our organically certified fabric. We will endeavour to deliver our Honeybee Wrap packs to our Indigogo supporters by the 1st of October 2015.

I'm a social psychology major,  I love life and I love filling it with laughter. I'm just a girl that wants to grow old enough to finish my studies, get married one day,  have kids, and well,  just live a long healthy life. I've  been fighting for almost 2yrs and surviving. I let cancer consume me and almost gave up, I hid my situation from the world, I recently came out to the world about my battles.  You can check out my story on YouTube @ 'Journey de AbenaRose' where I tell all. It hasn't been easy. I chose not to do chemo due to the harsh affects of it and my already weakened immune system and kidneys.  Chemo would only have hurt me moreso. I've surpassed the lifespan doctors gave me. They told me that I only had a few months to live,  currently,  I'm almost 2yrs in. Treating myself naturally has not been easy, I spend about $1000 a month only on organic food and non-gmo supplements that I take. That's not to mention the herbs I buy and the traveling to natural healers that i'd like to partake in but I can't afford. Unfortunately me and my loved ones are facing many complications financially to keep me going. My dad was in a bad car accident in Africa right after my diagnosis. This caused him to be hospitalized for 6months. Within that time frame my family and loved ones had to cover extensive costs for him to be kept in the hospital and properly taken care of.  This cost the family almost $200 a day.  His condition and mine were just a very heavy load. Gratefully he's doing better now,  the only focus now is my health, which I know kills my family inside everyday.  Gratefully my friends have been trying to gain funds for me, but do to economical hardships of many,  it's hard to do so. So I decided to setup this page. I'm currently looking to get a surgery done to remove a baseball sized tumour out of my body,  however, due to my refusal of chemo, oncologists will not refer me to a surgeon,  I am looking into surgeons out of country,  if I can afford it, I'll do it. Please check my diagnosis story on YouTube as well as my instagram if it'll better help you understand my situation.  My instagram name is Abenarose. I'm honestly just at my wits end and a friend suggested this page to me, so I thought i'd try it. If you can help me financially in anyway,  it'd be a great blessing!  I was told that i'd need more than 15 grand by my herbalist due to everything I'm doing and need to do. However,  I figure it's a start.

<p>""What is the use of living, if it not be to strive for noble causes 
and to make this muddled world a better place for those who will live in

<p>Migraine and Cluster Headache are two of the most painful and debilitating conditions known 
to medical science, yet there are no effective preventive medications specifically for these disorders that 
strike down so many on a daily basis. In fact, severe headache disorders account for $Billions in lost productivity worldwide. According to the Migraine Research Foundation (source: 2015, <a href=""http://www.migraineresearchfoundation.org/frequently-asked-questions.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.migraineresearchfoundation.org/frequ...</a> )<br/><br/>""About 36 million Americans - roughly 10% of the total population - suffer from migraine. American employers lose more than $13 billion each year as a result of 113 million lost work days due to headache or migraine. Around 14 million people suffer from chronic daily headache, when attacks come nealy daily and treatment is extremely difficult and costly. Chronic headache sufferers are part of the legions of Americans with chronic pain who consume an enormous amount of healthcare services, with an estimated annual cost of $50 billion. And socially, in addition to the attack-related disability itself, many sufferers live in fear, knowing that at any time an attack could disrupt their ability to work or go to school, care for their families or enjoy social activities.""<br/><br/>Please help us raise

CHSG, Inc. is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization
 ( http://1.usa.gov/1GHeWdz ) dedicated to improving the lives of Migraine and Cluster Headache sufferers through 
Research, Education, Fact-based Information, and Compassionate Support. 
All donations are tax deductible and 100% of funds go toward our 
objectives.Find us!Our website: http://chsg.org

Our 2015 Objectives:

Continued research on ketamine infusion therapy with Jefferson 
Headache Center and potentially 2 more centers, publish outcomes ongoing
New research initiatives regarding TRP Channels as new target areas;
 specifically leveraging biopharm and phase IIB clinical study TRP V1, 
A1, and M8 antagonists the specifically address hypersensitivity to 
known triggers for both migraine and cluster headache and related 
trigeminal autonomic cephalgias. These triggers include the perception 
of moderate temperature and atmospheric pressure changes, noxious 
chemicals, vallinoid-based scents, and bright light sensitivity. There 
are several candidates already in the pipeline showing positive results,
 however, not yet indicated for headache.
Actively identify and pursue new research targets through patient-driven information capture and presentation, coupled with business-case driven opportunity identification for researchers and bio-pharma.

Deliver a Spiral Research Portal focused on ongoing data collection 
and reporting while also providing helpful data logging and doctor's 
office patient visit summary reports that will ease consistency in data 
capture, reporting, and turning anecdotal evidence into an aggregate 
information database for research and reporting.
Continued Awareness and Advocacy efforts with special focus in 
partnering with Healthcare and the Biopharma/Pharmaceutical industry as 
well as major headache research and healthcare centers.
Patient and Healthcare educational and training materials
Triple our patient reach in 2015, further reducing the number who 
currently suffer alone and without current and complete information 
regarding options, both approved and not yet approved physical and 
mental health treatments, financial and career support programs, and 
compassionate support for those in need.
Establish a Patient Registry of cluster headache sufferers. This will greatly assist future research.


Our 2014 Objectives include (completed):

Continued research on ketamine infusion therapy with Jefferson 
Headache Center and potentially 2 more centers, publish outcomes ongoing
Establish Rare Disorder status for cluster headache in the NORD registry (https://www.rarediseases.org/rare-disease-information/rare-diseases/byID/720/viewAbstract)
Engage directly with the pharmaceutical industry to educate and identify opportunities
Continued awareness efforts with a focus on expanded public, healthcare, and patient information and tools
Continued rapid growth in reaching cluster headache sufferers to 
provide direct support, accurate and trustworthy information, and 
opportunities to contribute to others
Continue to provide patient medical supplies, specifically O2PTIMASKS and related materials at a reduced cost to patients
Extend reach to include educational magazine rack inserts for doctors offices

This is of course not all we do, but it's our focus.

<p>Early Diagnosis and treatment Stage 0 =93% survival rate</p> <p>I am a nurse practitioner with 18 years experience.  I have been practicing in  house calls  programs whereby healthcare is brought into the individual or client's home since 2006  . Time and time again I have had to turn down my female patients' requests for a pelvic examination,either because they were having symptoms and needed to be checked or plain old "" I have not have had a pelvic examination for years"".  A few of my patients stated they have not had a pelvic examination in 30 years. These were generally female clients that are still in relationships or marriages.</p>
<p>Exposure to HPV -18 million adult females carry HPV -high risk forms can lead to precancerous cells and cancer in cervical tissue. 90% of cervical cancer are caused by HPV. This is why early detection and treatment is key to saving women's lives from cervical cancer. </p>
<p>""My home gyne exam bed"" (CAPGED) (Patent Pending) was born out of this constant unfulfilled need that I observed among my female patients. I decided to invent a device that would enable female patients to have pelvic examinations, right in the comfort of their own home on a surface such as their own bed, without having to wait for weeks for an appointment to do so and to make the required periodic and episodic examinations more homely and comfortable for the female patient.</p>
<p>It is recommended per guidedlines that females by age 21 get a pelvic examination every 3 years or earlier if sexually active. During a pelvic exam ,a swab of the cervix is done to rule out cervical cancer or dysplasia in the cervix.  Many young and older women even when sexually active forgo this examination or ignore any symptoms they may be having in their reproductive organ system until it is too late. HPV which is rampant among most sexually active adults in the US goes undetected for years until  cervical cancer results. If more young sexually active females were compliant with regular pelvic examinations as per guidelines, early detecton and treatment of cervical cancer would save lives. My Home Gyne Exam Bed can make this a reality by making pelvic exams possible in the home and increasing females' access  to providers who can perform this exam at home.</p>
<p>This is where supporters such as yourself come in to make it possible for this device to become a reality and available to every female patient and provider. </p>

<h2>How it works: the Grape perk</h2>
<ol>
<li>Simply choose one of the fresh grape perks</li>
<li>Decide which of your nearest local and independent retail outlets is most convenient and provide their name to us</li>
<li>We will manage, grow, trim, harvest and pack your premium 2kg box of grapes</li>
<li>The grapes will be transported to our wholesale market coordinator, located in either Brisbane, Sydney or Melbourne markets<br/>
</li>
<li>Our coordinator will include your box of grapes in the shipment to your local greengrocer or corner store<br/>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<h3></h3>
<p>Included
 in your purchase price are the costs for the newly designed box and all
 cooling, transport and handling costs for your delivery. We will notify you by the email supplied when you can pick up your box of premium, sweet and tasty table grapes.</p>If you chosen perk <i>is</i> grapes, you'll receive your fresh grapes before the end of December via your local greengrocer or fresh food outlet.<br/><h3>The Why</h3>There are many ways to slice an onion as they say, and the same goes for growing grapes. Supermarket buying power has pushed the growing of grapes down a track that creates reliably high yields, with large bunches and berries and<b> minimal flavor</b>. Some might call it factory production but perhaps this is the world we live in.<br/>
</div> <div>Growing fruit with maximum taste means more time and less additives. Grapes are a delicate product and cannot be mechanically harvested or processed. <br/>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434855727/ey5wyurveid2npe8vw1g.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>To ensure the grapes have the best chance at making it fresh to your table, we spend time on each vine, trimming leaves, removing slow growing canes and trimming bunches to ensure they have enough space to grow.</p>
<p>We're <b>not</b> after donations. Our aim is to connect with our supporters to ensure they can enjoy high quality and tasty grapes. Our aim is to offer you a superior product at a pre-production price; it will help us to prove our point that customers do actually want fresh and premium produce!<br/></p>
<p>What we need is a commitment. All the time and manual labour expended throughout the growing season accounts for about 60% of our cost of production. Knowing that a percentage of our product has been presold makes that outlay more sustainable.<br/></p>
<p>Our main perk for you is a box of grapes for Christmas! Delivered to your area. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434856231/lvkgxra5okqajnwocfpn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>That's right. Fresh, tasty, clean table grapes in a special gift box for you.</p> <p></p>
<ul>
<li>the funds will be used to create and purchase a new box to differentiate our premium product</li>
<li>they will be used to employ casual staff throughout the growing season to ensure that we're able to produce the premium summer fruit<br/>
</li>
<li>as a reward, if you would like, you will receive a special 2kg gift box full of fresh and tasty seedless table grapes (see perks)<br/>
</li>
<li>reaching the funding goal will ensure enough product is forward sold making it possible to deliver premium, fresh table grapes for years to come!</li>
<li>if successful, and if you, our customers like the service, we will <b>launch an online forward-sale site </b>allowing people to pre-purchase their Christmas grapes every year<br/>
</li>
<li>we will also expand our production window by partnering with other premium producers in other regions - current Australian table grape production is from November to April (grapes at other times are either stored or imported)</li>
<li>
<h3>if we don't reach our funding goal, we will still deliver the perks to those that supported our project: win win!</h3>

<h3>The Situation<br/>
</h3> <p>We are not here to unfairly criticise supermarkets. Their business is to ensure security of supply and to provide their customers, you and I, with an affordable product, and to ensure profits for shareholders.<br/></p>
<p>The unfortunate downside of this for table grapes is that in order to supply the supermarkets, a grower needs to supply hundreds of thousands of boxes and it simply isn't possible for them to grow that quantity to a premium standard. Their pickers offer no grade selection and every bunch is added to the box. This means you get a mixed bag of ripeness, taste and quality with each grape purchase. Who wants to take that chance??<br/></p>
<p>We see this as unfortunate because the consumer is missing out on a fantastic grape eating experience, and because we think that many people love grapes as much as we do, we wanted to come up with a way to bring this loveable portable snack back to fruit bowls everywhere!<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Fresh fruit production, like most forms of farming, is fraught with risks and challenges.</p>
<p>The biggest risk our business faces are climate and the market.</p>
<p><b>MARKET</b><br/></p>
<p>Through this project we aim to mitigate the market risks. Up to 80% of table grapes are sold direct to supermarkets these days. That's great for the big supermarket growers. For smaller growers and family farms, this means that there is a pool of about 20% remaining across the central market system where grapes are sold on to independent retailers, providores, corner stores and fruit stands.</p>
<p>The 20% window sometimes enhances volatility, but mainly it creates over supply, or a glut. This can mean great prices for consumers, but at what cost?</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">When prices are low, growers spend less time and money ensuring they pick the best grapes to provide a premium product. It's a simple business decision and unfortunately it leads to lower quality or mixed quality table grapes forming a glut in the market. </span><br/></p>
<p>It then becomes a compounding problem. The quality is lower, people are less likely to buy grapes, over supply increases, prices get lower still yet consumers don't want to buy sub-par grapes. Research shows that you won't be back to buy grapes for 6 weeks after a bad grape experience.<br/></p>
<p><i><b>""The bitterness of poor quality remains long after the sweetness of low price is forgotten"" </b>- Benjamin Franklin</i><br/></p>
<p>All this can be avoided if we enjoyed our fruit and were confident that we paid a fair price.</p>
<p><b>CLIMATE</b></p>
<p>Frost - frost at the wrong time can burn newly formed buds or shoots, causing damage to canes and severely reducing yield potential.</p>
<p>We manage this risk through the use of a natural gas powered frost machine. Frosts usually occur when cold air is able to pool or settle. The frost machine creates enough disturbance to prevent this and raises the ambient temperature by 2-3'C</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434856280/o3nuizrtyldjormvbxdi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>Water - the Balonne River, at the top end of the Murray-Darling basin, has been a reliable source since we moved to the farm in 1989. Water is pumped, cleaned through sand filters and delivered to the vines through a drip system, ensuring that the vine only receives as much as it needs.</p>
<p>Storms - the growing season and harvest are the most crucial times when it comes to storm activity. We prefer little rain, and the heavy storms can do the most damage in the weeks leading up to harvest. A new pergola system is being trialled for our premium produce and it provides some protection for fruit hanging on vines, however it is difficult to defend against the biggest and nastiest storms when they occur. Fingers crossed!</p>
<p></p>
<h3>How we'll grow your premium produce<br/>
</h3>Growing a premium product is more costly than producing quantity. <br/><p><b>Pruning:</b> we perform what we call selective pruning. We assess each vine individually and decide which canes are likely to provide the best quality fruit each year, and how those canes will shape the vine for years to come.</p>
<p><b>Thinning &amp; trimming:</b> once new growth begins and we can see the buds that eventually form bunches of grapes, we begin removing smaller and weaker looking shoots to ensure that all nutrients provided by the vine end up in the best bunches. We do this again when the bunches are fully formed and we remove bunches that are too big or small or in a limiting position. This provides us with a more uniform crop and a higher percentage of high quality fruit, but as it is done by hand it becomes very expensive.</p>
<p><b>Picking:</b> when the fruit is ripening, we don't pick it all. Larger farms will pick everything in one pass to keep costs down however we spend time ensuring that the pickers only pick the best quality, ripe bunches. Our pickers will pick fewer kilograms per hour to achieve this, and we expect to yield fewer kilograms per vine. This leads to higher production costs but is essential for achieving the high quality we all seek!</p>
<p>We focus on sustainable farming, and at Camelot we believe in biological farming. We use high value high quality compost from Wide Bay Compost who use recycled materials (green waster) from Bundaberg. We apply this to the vineyard each year and feed the good bacteria with a fish hydrolysate (fishy cordial) and other kelp and seaweed products. A microscopic exam (see gallery) reveals an abundance of biological activity which converts nutrients into plant accessible food, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers (which would kill this biology). We believe this biological approach is the most economically and environmentally sustainable way to produce table grapes (most corporate farms have strictly chemical application programs).<br/></p>
<p>We form workplace agreements with all casual staff that allow them to earn above the award wage. By being one of the better payers of pickers we are able to source the best staff.<br/></p>
<p></p>

<br/>We also have a Quality Assurance team re-packing (for the 2kg boxes) and checking the boxes after they are picked. <br/>

<br/><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b>
</div><div> <p>Sometimes you may not be able to contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p> <ul> <li>Please help us get the word out and make some noise about our campaign.</li> <li>Share this with your network by email and social media</li>
</ul>
<p>Sustainable food production is in all of our interests. A smaller farm is better positioned to assess need for change and adapt accordingly; but we can't compete with the factory, corporate or supermarket farms who will always win with economies of scale. <br/></p>
<p>We are trialling other varieties of table grapes, and other produce types that will allow us to make better use of our infrastructure. Follow our facebook page for updates on passion-fruit, chilli, blueberry and kiwi-berry development.<br/></p>

We will notify you by the email supplied when you can pick up your box of premium, sweet and tasty table grapes.If you chosen perk is grapes, you'll receive your fresh grapes before the end of December via your local greengrocer or fresh food outlet.The WhyThere are many ways to slice an onion as they say, and the same goes for growing grapes. Supermarket buying power has pushed the growing of grapes down a track that creates reliably high yields, with large bunches and berries and minimal flavor. Some might call it factory production but perhaps this is the world we live in.
 Growing fruit with maximum taste means more time and less additives. Grapes are a delicate product and cannot be mechanically harvested or processed. 



To ensure the grapes have the best chance at making it fresh to your table, we spend time on each vine, trimming leaves, removing slow growing canes and trimming bunches to ensure they have enough space to grow.
We're not after donations. Our aim is to connect with our supporters to ensure they can enjoy high quality and tasty grapes. Our aim is to offer you a superior product at a pre-production price; it will help us to prove our point that customers do actually want fresh and premium produce!
What we need is a commitment. All the time and manual labour expended throughout the growing season accounts for about 60% of our cost of production. Knowing that a percentage of our product has been presold makes that outlay more sustainable.
Our main perk for you is a box of grapes for Christmas! Delivered to your area. 


That's right. Fresh, tasty, clean table grapes in a special gift box for you. 

the funds will be used to create and purchase a new box to differentiate our premium product
they will be used to employ casual staff throughout the growing season to ensure that we're able to produce the premium summer fruit

as a reward, if you would like, you will receive a special 2kg gift box full of fresh and tasty seedless table grapes (see perks)

reaching the funding goal will ensure enough product is forward sold making it possible to deliver premium, fresh table grapes for years to come!
if successful, and if you, our customers like the service, we will launch an online forward-sale site allowing people to pre-purchase their Christmas grapes every year

we will also expand our production window by partnering with other premium producers in other regions - current Australian table grape production is from November to April (grapes at other times are either stored or imported)

if we don't reach our funding goal, we will still deliver the perks to those that supported our project: win win!






  
The Situation
 We are not here to unfairly criticise supermarkets. Their business is to ensure security of supply and to provide their customers, you and I, with an affordable product, and to ensure profits for shareholders.
The unfortunate downside of this for table grapes is that in order to supply the supermarkets, a grower needs to supply hundreds of thousands of boxes and it simply isn't possible for them to grow that quantity to a premium standard. Their pickers offer no grade selection and every bunch is added to the box. This means you get a mixed bag of ripeness, taste and quality with each grape purchase. Who wants to take that chance??
We see this as unfortunate because the consumer is missing out on a fantastic grape eating experience, and because we think that many people love grapes as much as we do, we wanted to come up with a way to bring this loveable portable snack back to fruit bowls everywhere!
  Risks & Challenges Fresh fruit production, like most forms of farming, is fraught with risks and challenges.
The biggest risk our business faces are climate and the market.
MARKET
Through this project we aim to mitigate the market risks. Up to 80% of table grapes are sold direct to supermarkets these days. That's great for the big supermarket growers. For smaller growers and family farms, this means that there is a pool of about 20% remaining across the central market system where grapes are sold on to independent retailers, providores, corner stores and fruit stands.
The 20% window sometimes enhances volatility, but mainly it creates over supply, or a glut. This can mean great prices for consumers, but at what cost?
When prices are low, growers spend less time and money ensuring they pick the best grapes to provide a premium product. It's a simple business decision and unfortunately it leads to lower quality or mixed quality table grapes forming a glut in the market. 
It then becomes a compounding problem. The quality is lower, people are less likely to buy grapes, over supply increases, prices get lower still yet consumers don't want to buy sub-par grapes. Research shows that you won't be back to buy grapes for 6 weeks after a bad grape experience.
""The bitterness of poor quality remains long after the sweetness of low price is forgotten"" - Benjamin Franklin
All this can be avoided if we enjoyed our fruit and were confident that we paid a fair price.
CLIMATE
Frost - frost at the wrong time can burn newly formed buds or shoots, causing damage to canes and severely reducing yield potential.
We manage this risk through the use of a natural gas powered frost machine. Frosts usually occur when cold air is able to pool or settle. The frost machine creates enough disturbance to prevent this and raises the ambient temperature by 2-3'C



Water - the Balonne River, at the top end of the Murray-Darling basin, has been a reliable source since we moved to the farm in 1989. Water is pumped, cleaned through sand filters and delivered to the vines through a drip system, ensuring that the vine only receives as much as it needs.
Storms - the growing season and harvest are the most crucial times when it comes to storm activity. We prefer little rain, and the heavy storms can do the most damage in the weeks leading up to harvest. A new pergola system is being trialled for our premium produce and it provides some protection for fruit hanging on vines, however it is difficult to defend against the biggest and nastiest storms when they occur. Fingers crossed!

How we'll grow your premium produce
Growing a premium product is more costly than producing quantity. Pruning: we perform what we call selective pruning. We assess each vine individually and decide which canes are likely to provide the best quality fruit each year, and how those canes will shape the vine for years to come.
Thinning & trimming: once new growth begins and we can see the buds that eventually form bunches of grapes, we begin removing smaller and weaker looking shoots to ensure that all nutrients provided by the vine end up in the best bunches. We do this again when the bunches are fully formed and we remove bunches that are too big or small or in a limiting position. This provides us with a more uniform crop and a higher percentage of high quality fruit, but as it is done by hand it becomes very expensive.
Picking: when the fruit is ripening, we don't pick it all. Larger farms will pick everything in one pass to keep costs down however we spend time ensuring that the pickers only pick the best quality, ripe bunches. Our pickers will pick fewer kilograms per hour to achieve this, and we expect to yield fewer kilograms per vine. This leads to higher production costs but is essential for achieving the high quality we all seek!
We focus on sustainable farming, and at Camelot we believe in biological farming. We use high value high quality compost from Wide Bay Compost who use recycled materials (green waster) from Bundaberg. We apply this to the vineyard each year and feed the good bacteria with a fish hydrolysate (fishy cordial) and other kelp and seaweed products. A microscopic exam (see gallery) reveals an abundance of biological activity which converts nutrients into plant accessible food, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers (which would kill this biology). We believe this biological approach is the most economically and environmentally sustainable way to produce table grapes (most corporate farms have strictly chemical application programs).
We form workplace agreements with all casual staff that allow them to earn above the award wage. By being one of the better payers of pickers we are able to source the best staff.


We also have a Quality Assurance team re-packing (for the 2kg boxes) and checking the boxes after they are picked. 


Other Ways You Can Help
 Sometimes you may not be able to contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:  Please help us get the word out and make some noise about our campaign. Share this with your network by email and social media

Sustainable food production is in all of our interests. A smaller farm is better positioned to assess need for change and adapt accordingly; but we can't compete with the factory, corporate or supermarket farms who will always win with economies of scale. 
We are trialling other varieties of table grapes, and other produce types that will allow us to make better use of our infrastructure. Follow our facebook page for updates on passion-fruit, chilli, blueberry and kiwi-berry development.

<h3>WHY DOES ACNE STILL EXIST?</h3>
<div><b style=""font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;""></b></div>
<p>You may already know that acne is linked to the bacterium Propionibacterium acnes, which nestles in the dark, oily, oxygen-deprived crannies of our pores. Acne is also linked to inflammation, overgrowth of the upper skin layer, excess sebum, and depression. Because the root of the problem has long seemed to be a bacterium, antibiotics have been the go-to treatment. Dermatologists are also working on developing something called “antimicrobial peptides” to kill the bacteria — anticipating the day that the bacteria outgrow our current antibiotics, and they fail us.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Still, as millions of people who have used antibiotics in failed attempts know, killing the bacteria doesn’t work for everyone. It also turns out there are different strains of the bacterium, some of which may cause the more severe cases. It might be too early to say that there are distinct “good” and “bad” strains of the acne bacteria, but it does appear that killing all of them might not be the best plan</p>

<li>Teenagers, hormones play a significant role in acne outbreaks among teenagers and prepubescent children</li>
<li>Blackheads, acne begin with the development of a plug of hardened sebum that stops up the opening of the follicular pores on the skin. </li>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">How Probiotic Action Works?</span></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">Probiotic Action is created from spores which, when mixed with water are activated to create a fantastic solution that delivers the probiotic to the proper location. These spores then attach the skin. And, even though Probiotic Action doesn’t kill the P. acne bacteria, the beneficial healthy bacteria eat the excess skin and toxins that the P. acnes need in order to thrive through “starving” the P. acnes, and gets rid of the dead bacteria, too! Also, when your skin’s bacteria are in balance, you are more likely to be protected from bad bacteria, free radicals,  and pollutants. Acne occurs when the skin  is out of balance with more bad bacteria than probiotic bacteria, so reducing the P. acnes population is an important step in controlling acne. </span></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;""><i>Our key breakthrough</i><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> was developing a spore-forming bacteria; this means that inside the bacteria cell is a hardened structure, or spore.  This hard structure safeguards the cell’s genetic material from the heat and pressure of manufacturing processes and the challenges  of shelf life.</span></span></h3>

<h3><b>HOW PROBIOTIC ACTION WORK ON YOUR SKIN</b></h3>
<div></div>
<p>Probiotic Action work to restore the skin’s natural balance of good bacteria. By restoring this natural balance the skin is better able to cope with the daily stresses by creating a natural barrier against bad bacteria, pollutants, free radicals, and allergens. Probiotic Action use will also encourage cell turnover so that your skin looks brighter, tighter and healthier. Probiotic Action’s products are also powerful antidote against wrinkles.</p>

<h3>BENZOYL PEROXIDE AND SALICYLIC ACID HAVE ISSUES</h3>
<div></div>
<p>The FDA released a statement in April of 2014 that stated, “The use of certain acne products containing the active ingredients benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid can cause rare but serious and potentially life-threatening allergic reactions or severe irritation.” And the scary thing is, there is currently no warning of these side effects on any of the OTC labels. Is clear skin worth all of these damaging, potentially life threatening side effects? Not to us. Which is why we have found another way and it works just as well, if not better than those harsh chemicals.</p>

</div></div>","Imagine if you could clear your skin at the push of a button.  If you could enjoy a clear kin without dryness or damage.

If you no longer had to worry about things like: 



Trying one expensive treatment after another.


Spending hundreds or even thousand of dollars for possible solutions.

Covering your skin with concealer.
Wondering why your skin isn’t clear yet.
Self doubt and poor self image.



Sounds like you just imagined life without acne.







Probiotic Action is the world’s first topical beneficial bacteria spray – which helps you get to have a clear skin – without harsh chemicals, or ineffective gimmicks.

It’s a product you spray on your skin AM, PM or at your convenience.


Sprayable Probiotic is simple, natural, straightforward, and just plain effective.

Sprayable Sleep helps you:




Get healthy, clear skin


No more acne or rosacea


Without the stress and anxiety. Not to mention the added self doubt and poor self imge.

Gets you back to healthy and gorgeous skin that you always wanted.







WHY DOES ACNE STILL EXIST?

You may already know that acne is linked to the bacterium Propionibacterium acnes, which nestles in the dark, oily, oxygen-deprived crannies of our pores. Acne is also linked to inflammation, overgrowth of the upper skin layer, excess sebum, and depression. Because the root of the problem has long seemed to be a bacterium, antibiotics have been the go-to treatment. Dermatologists are also working on developing something called “antimicrobial peptides” to kill the bacteria — anticipating the day that the bacteria outgrow our current antibiotics, and they fail us.

Still, as millions of people who have used antibiotics in failed attempts know, killing the bacteria doesn’t work for everyone. It also turns out there are different strains of the bacterium, some of which may cause the more severe cases. It might be too early to say that there are distinct “good” and “bad” strains of the acne bacteria, but it does appear that killing all of them might not be the best plan


WHY TRY PROBIOTIC ACTION?


Probiotic Action is perfect for people that want  a clear skin but just have trouble doing so. This includes:


Adults who are experiencing acne issues, they often overlook the root acne cause, which is usually an imbalance on their skin’s natural bacteria
Teenagers, hormones play a significant role in acne outbreaks among teenagers and prepubescent children
Blackheads, acne begin with the development of a plug of hardened sebum that stops up the opening of the follicular pores on the skin. 
Millions of people who have used antibiotics in failed attempts know, killing the bacteria doesn’t work for everyone





How Probiotic Action Works?
Probiotic Action is created from spores which, when mixed with water are activated to create a fantastic solution that delivers the probiotic to the proper location. These spores then attach the skin. And, even though Probiotic Action doesn’t kill the P. acne bacteria, the beneficial healthy bacteria eat the excess skin and toxins that the P. acnes need in order to thrive through “starving” the P. acnes, and gets rid of the dead bacteria, too! Also, when your skin’s bacteria are in balance, you are more likely to be protected from bad bacteria, free radicals,  and pollutants. Acne occurs when the skin  is out of balance with more bad bacteria than probiotic bacteria, so reducing the P. acnes population is an important step in controlling acne. 
Our key breakthrough was developing a spore-forming bacteria; this means that inside the bacteria cell is a hardened structure, or spore.  This hard structure safeguards the cell’s genetic material from the heat and pressure of manufacturing processes and the challenges  of shelf life.



IT IS FAST, EASY AND GENTLE

Using Probiotic Action is as easy as it is effective. 

Just spray it 2 to 3 times a day on the affected area, and let it dry. 




Is a natural product.


Do not contain harsh chemicals.


Are environmentally friendly.


Are water-based.


Can be used long-term.


Reduce the number of bacterial pathogens (agents that produces disease).


Do not create pathogens that will develop resistance to treatment later on.


Clean your skin at a microscopic level.






Why a probiotic treatment and why now? 




Treatment against acne has not changed for several decades, They consist of antibiotics and retinoids that are applied for several months; these can have several side effects.


A probiotic acne therapy consists of ""good"" bacteria that are part of the healthy skin microbiota. They are topically applied to the skin and should out-compete the ""bad"" bacterial population as seen on acne-affected skin. This treatment  have minimal to no risks of side effects. 




PROBIOTIC ACTION HAS JUST 2 INGREDIENTS




Purified water


Bacillus Ferment spore forming bacteria





WHY SPRAY?





Can be applied on your schedule

The sprayer can easily be carried in a pocket or purse for application during the day


Probiotic Action is unscented, colorless, you spray on your skin. 


Stop applying creams that contain harsh chemicals. Stop taking antibiotic that create big bugs resistant to antibiotics.


Is gentle since is water and no allergenic and non comogodenic 

Don’t dry or damage your skin in the healing process. 







HOW PROBIOTIC ACTION WORK ON YOUR SKIN

Probiotic Action work to restore the skin’s natural balance of good bacteria. By restoring this natural balance the skin is better able to cope with the daily stresses by creating a natural barrier against bad bacteria, pollutants, free radicals, and allergens. Probiotic Action use will also encourage cell turnover so that your skin looks brighter, tighter and healthier. Probiotic Action’s products are also powerful antidote against wrinkles.







BENZOYL PEROXIDE AND SALICYLIC ACID HAVE ISSUES

The FDA released a statement in April of 2014 that stated, “The use of certain acne products containing the active ingredients benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid can cause rare but serious and potentially life-threatening allergic reactions or severe irritation.” And the scary thing is, there is currently no warning of these side effects on any of the OTC labels. Is clear skin worth all of these damaging, potentially life threatening side effects? Not to us. Which is why we have found another way and it works just as well, if not better than those harsh chemicals.


THE PROBIOTIC ACTION SYSMET

Each bottle of  concentrated Probiotic Action contain 0.5 fl oz – which is 30 uses (a month’s supply with regular use) when mixed with water.
Results in as little as one week of recommended application





FAST SHIPPINGThe worst thing about crowdfunding campaigns is the waiting. Waiting for the campaign to end...waiting for the product to be finalized...waiting for it to be manufactured...waiting for it to be shipped. So much waiting. That's why we've decided to offer backers the opportunity to get their perks within 3 weeks since we have received your contribution. We have an inventory of Probiotic Action and will send out starting the 1st week of March to backers that order the relevant perks. 


Testimonial

In my opinion, probiotic action is a therapeutic breakthrough in the treatment of acne and eczema.  My clinical results are still in the early stage, but they have been very positive.  Probiotic Action is easy to use and directly addresses the pathophysiology of skin disease in a way that no other product that I know of can.  Just as gastrointestinal microbiome therapy is proving to be essential for gut and immune health, I'm sure that probiotic skin treatments will become the standard of the future.

Marie Cammerer: This product has helped me, an adult with hormonal acne, as well as my teenage daughter. I LOVE this product. I only wish I had taken ""before"" pictures.

<p>Compared to

overweight or obese. Overweight kids are more likely to have risk factors for
cardiovascular disease, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, poor

<p>Fly Movement’s mission is to improve self-esteem, health,

program gives students a sense of purpose for channeling their energy toward
achievement of a goal. As
a result, their confidence grows and healthy habits acquired at this age are
more likely to become life-long habits which are important because the way
their metabolism shapes at this age will have a decisive impact in their adult
life.</p>

While on an International mission in Paraguay in 2013, the members of our Board of Directors worked, along with other volunteers, in high-security prison and woman penitentiary (yeah, try to find the executives from the United Way there!). 
Visit our website to learn about other HMO missions and view photos & videos.
  Other Ways You Can Help Money will help us to buy supplies for clinics. but your participation is priceless. Every year our volunteers contribute hundredth of hours of free dental and health services. If you are not a doctor, you can still contribute in many ways, such as:

Assisting with setting mobile clinics
Working on one of our committees
Sharing the word about us on Facebook and Twitter

The tools inside the kit are placed in the order that a manicurist will use them, letting you enjoy that manicure with peace of mind. We started Sani Sak to help prevent others from suffering the same fate as Kelly, and thousands of others that have been victims to similar and sometimes worse infections and outcomes. We want to make sure you still have the pleasure of visiting a salon, and be protected from the hidden dangers you are exposed to, at the same time! Our company was born out of a woman’s desire to live a healthier and pampered lifestyle, and everything we do today is meant to help others do the same.A manicurist for over 20 years, and the unlikely victim of a nail infection so severe, she’s lost both of her thumbnails forever. Together, they’ve created a complete all in one nail kit providing a sanitary experience with everything you need for a safe professional salon visit -- putting the “cure” in manicure to help ensure no one else has to suffer the same fate from the potentially harmful bacteria and fungus looming in nail salons.",23.0,2,"1 Campaign

 why this herb is so amazing – and learn how it may help you or your loved one. </i></h3><div>
<br/>

help patients navigate the often confusing maze that is the world of medical
marijuana – and I am asking your help to get it published.  Medical marijuana has helped me cope
with symptoms from a chronic lifelong condition far better than any pharmaceuticals I’ve used –  and I want everyone to
know about this option for symptom relief and for healing. </p>
<p>Over the past few decades, I've coauthored 12 books with experts on holistic health, stress management, brain optimization, and other topics.  And now I'm passionate about telling everyone about the awesomeness of medical marijuana!  I wrote this book because I want other patients to understand the many 
complexities of this herb, including WHY scientists believe it works so 
well for so many. <br/></p>
<p><b>Most of the perks offered in this campaign include, in essence, the pre-purchase of  copies of the book, which will be sent when it is published in September.  Additionally, ALL contributors will receive a PDF of 3 chapters for FREE right away.  AND I have included part of Chapter 1 at the end of this campaign page so you don't have to wait to plunge in!</b></p>

<p></p>
<br/>When I first tried medical marijuana, I was desperate for something that would help ease the pain and 
discomfort
of my physical symptoms and not be addictive like the prescription drugs
 I was taking.  Those drugs had ceased being effective – and I
did not want to take <i>stronger </i>drugs,
which came with an increasing number of scary potential side effects. I was immediately surprised at HOW effective it was – and disappointed that I hadn’t tried it
sooner. Medical marijuana quickly became my lifeline to greater well-being. <br/><br/>
<p>Medical marijuana is constantly in the news these days—and yet
when I talk to friends and family, as well as doctors, I find that few understand
what it really is, what it really does,
and WHY it is so effective for so many.  <b>Many questions arise when starting on this journey, including: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>
Why should I
consider medical marijuana, and is it right for me?</li>
<li>
What health
issues can be helped by it?</li>
<li>

What makes it
such a potent healing herb?</li>
<li>
How and where
do I legally get the marijuana? </li>
<li>
What strain,
what form, what potency, and what dose is right for me?  
</li>
<li>
What do I tell
the kids about taking something that they’ve been told is illegal and wrong?</li>
</ul>

Unless
we have a knowledgeable ally, most patients must answer these questions for
ourselves—often, all on our own. In fact, in some jurisdictions, doctors aren’t <i>allowed 
</i>to tell you anything about medical marijuana.<br/><br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1399946/files/20150420135234-Medical_Marijuana_300_x_620.jpg?1429563154"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>Clearing Up the Confusion Around Medical Marijuana ...<br/>
</h3>
<br/>The world of medical marijuana is filled with unfamiliar terminology, numerous types of cannabis products to choose from, and very little specific direction on the best options for each patient. One
has to be discerning and at least somewhat knowledgeable in order to sift
through the mounds of information that is presented as ""truth"" in books, articles and the Internet—a great deal of which is outdated,
inaccurate, or biased. <br/><br/>Most people tend to think of medical marijuana as one
specific medicine, which gets you high, when in reality each strain of cannabis
is, in some ways, a different medicine from every other strain.  <b><i>Treatment
options now include non-psychoactive (no ""high""), smokeless, and
topical forms and formulations of cannabis, </i></b>with many new strains
continually being created and bred for their specific healing qualities.

<br/><br/>I
wrote <b><i>The</i> <i>Medical Marijuana Handbook</i></b> to answer your questions, soothe your
concerns, and give you the information you—or a family member or friend—need in
order to make informed decisions and effectively use medical marijuana. I
literally walk you by the hand through all that you need to know, drawing not only
from my own experience and research, but from interviews I’ve conducted with
health professionals, medical cannabis experts, and other patients. I’ve worked
hard to make sure this information is as up-to-date and accurate as possible. Even if you know a lot about cannabis, so much
is changing that there’s a good chance you’ll find many new-to-you facts in my
book. <br/>
<br/><h3>
</h3>
<h3>
</h3>
<br/><h2><b></b></h2>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b><b>Here's What Leading-Edge Medical Doctors Say About Medical Cannabis</b></b></h3>
<p></p>
<h3><b><b>
</b></b></h3>
<p><b>Dr. Sanjay Gupta:</b> In a 2013 article entitled “Why I
Changed My Mind on Weed,” Dr. Gupta totally reversed his previous stand against
medical marijuana. He now says that cannabis has “very legitimate medical
applications” and <b>“sometimes it’s the only thing that works.”</b> CNN.com; August 9, 2013</p>
<p><b>Dr. Mehmet
Oz:</b>""I grew up like most of
my generation believing that marijuana was something Satan was throwing at
Americans, a communist plot. But I think most of us have come around to believe
that <b>marijuana is hugely beneficial when used correctly for medicinal
purposes</b>,"" Larry King
Live, CNN, May 12, 2014</p>
<p><b>Dr. Lester
Grinspoon,</b> Emeritus Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School: “…
[marijuana] is extraordinarily safe – <b>safer than most medicines prescribed
every day</b>. If marijuana were a new discovery rather than a well-known substance
carrying cultural and political baggage, it would be hailed as a wonder drug.” “Marijuana
as Wonder Drug,” Boston Globe, March 1, 2007 </p>
<br/><h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What It Will Take to Publish <i>The Medical Marijuana Handbook</i>
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>My book is fully written and in the stages of production. It is a
full-length book of approximately 75,000 words and will be published <b>by September,
2015</b>.  My goal is to raise <b>$35,000</b> to publish and launch <i>The
Medical Marijuana Handbook</i>. Publishing costs of $20,000 include editing,
interior design and formatting for both print and eBooks, cover art, printing, and shipping.
Marketing costs of $15,000 include a website, short promotional videos for
YouTube, and book launch expenses.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>As I want to get this information into the hands of as many people as
possible, a stretch goal of <b>$50,000</b> would allow me to hire a PR firm and
do some local and national advertising to raise awareness of the healing
properties of this amazing herb, help remove some of the stigma attached to it,
and get my book into the hands of the people who most need it.  </p>
<p>My <i>dream</i> is to place a full-page ad in <i>The New York Times,</i> and
through that ad give free eBook copies of <b><i>The Medical Marijuana Handbook</i>
</b>to as many people as possible to help educate them about cannabis medicine.
Of course, like any New York real estate, a full-page ad comes with a high
price tag. So if I reach a stretch goal of <b>$100,000</b>, look out <i>New York
Times</i>! </p>
<p>I envision my book in the hands of thought leaders –  health professionals, politicians, members of the judiciary, and educators – because I believe it will help them understand WHY cannabis should be available to all patients. Okay, so you may be thinking that getting the book into the hands of influential people doesn't mean they will read it.  And that's true.  They may not read the book, but maybe one of their relatives, their neighbors, or their coworkers WILL read it.  Each person who becomes educated about the truth of cannabis medicine helps to tip the balance a bit more for all of us.  And that brings us closer to a world in which the herb is available to all.<br/></p>
<p><b>Please join me and together we will raise awareness. The more you know, the more you can help others understand!</b></p>
<p>The money raised from this campaign will enable me to roll <b><i>The Medical
Marijuana Handbook</i></b> out in a way this important topic deserves. </p>

<h3><b>Praise for <i>The Medical Marijuana Handbook</i></b></h3>
<p><b>""</b>The medical uses of marijuana are
changing the lives of thousands of individuals and these applications will
continue to expand.  Norma Eckroate's <b><i>The Medical Marijuana Handbook</i></b> sheds
much-needed light on this rapidly evolving field.”<b>  <br/>
— Larry Dossey, MD, </b>author of <i>ONE
MIND: How Our Individual Mind Is Part of a Greater Consciousness and Why It
Matters</i></p>
<p><i>""</i><b><i>The Medical Marijuana Handbook</i></b> provides an in-depth and personal
look into one of the leading untapped resources in modern medicine. In her
wonderful book, Norma Eckroate provides insights as both a patient and a
researcher on the history of cannabis, its benefits and applications, and
dosing. She also explains why cannabis is one of the most beneficial medicines
available today because of the unique and holistic ways that it heals. I highly
recommend this book to anyone who is on a healing journey.”      <b>—John H. Hicks, MD </b><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b><i>""The Medical Marijuana Handbook</i> </b>is a 'must read'
for anyone who wonders if cannabis might be helpful for them. In this excellent
book, Norma Eckroate provides us with a layperson’s primer on the science
behind cannabis. The book is chock-full of practical information – and I
especially appreciate Eckroate’s holistic perspective and body-mind-spirit
approach. As a psychologist, it is intriguing to follow case studies and
reports of the efficacy experienced by medical cannabis patients for conditions
such as anxiety, attention disorders, bipolar disorder, and post-traumatic
stress disorder, among others. It is my sincere hope that this healing herb
will be more accessible to those for whom it can truly be a natural and effective
option<b>.""</b>

<blockquote><p>Note: Space on this page doesn't allow me to share this entire chapter, so I'm excerpting only part of it here.<br/></p></blockquote>
<p>
</p>
<p>When I first
became a medical marijuana patient, I was shocked at how effective it was at quelling
symptoms that I’ve suffered with for years. The results I experienced, from the
very first day I took it, were dramatic. I’d heard lots of great things about medical
marijuana over the years but I really didn’t expect it to be <i>that </i>beneficial. </p>

As medical
cannabis quickly became my lifeline to greater well-being, I realized that I had
been stuck in stereotypes fostered by decades of slanted and incorrect ideas
about this gift from Nature – and I started to see it as the miracle herb that
so many people have long proclaimed it to be.<br/><br/><p>I was curious
about why it was so effective for me and disappointed that I hadn’t tried it
sooner – so I began to research this much maligned herb. The more I learned
about marijuana, the more complex – and fascinating and unique – it was. I
found myself navigating a confusing maze that was filled with unfamiliar
terminology, numerous types of cannabis products to choose from, and very
little specific direction on the best options for me. </p>
<p>Marijuana has been
called a sacred herb, a super-herb, a Goddess herb, a master herb. Nature made
it unique among all of her offerings. As with other herbs and plants, it is
imbued with compounds that work together synergistically. However, it is
distinguished in the world of botanicals because no other plant seems to have
so many wide-ranging, health-promoting qualities. Hundreds of studies around
the world, many of them within the last two decades, confirm a huge number of
beneficial effects that marijuana has on the body and, in some cases, also the
mind. </p>
<p>Among
the many things I learned is that most of the medicinal strains of cannabis are
very different from the strains that recreational users prefer. And that makes
sense. The recreational user’s goal is generally to achieve the psychoactive
“high” or “stoned feeling” that most people associate with it, while – for many
medicinal cannabis patients – the “high” is an unwanted side effect. </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>My Experience Becoming a Medical Marijuana Patient</b></p>
<p>As a resident of
California with verified medical needs, I could have qualified as a medical
marijuana patient when it first became legal in the state in 1996. But, like
many others, I didn’t pursue it because the federal government continued to
wage a war on this amazing herb. Over those years, many Californians learned
the hard way that their state law didn’t protect them from seizure and
prosecution by the federal government. Many growers, dispensary owners, patients,
and parents of patients who are minors ended up in prison, with a criminal
record for the rest of their lives. News reports of those incidents scared many
potential patients – like me – away from even trying this herb. As of this
writing, news stories of these “crackdowns,” including seizures and arrests,
still occur throughout the world, although not nearly as often. Thankfully, the
situation is improving and cannabis is now available to many patients who have
not had access to it in the past.</p>
<p>As I continued to
study cannabis as a medicine, I was shocked to learn so much that I didn’t know
– but felt I <i>should </i>have known. I
have written on holistic health and complementary modalities off and on for
several decades and I thought I actually knew quite a bit about these topics,
including the subject of herbal medicine. My personal health choices have
always veered away from pharmaceutical drugs as much as possible, preferring
the most natural and holistic treatments to the potential negative side effects
that are part and parcel of most pharmaceuticals. At one point in time, I
didn’t even have a pain reliever like aspirin in my house because I didn’t want
to take pharmaceutical drugs unless I felt it was needed as a last resort. Then
I came to understand that – just as the side effects of a drug are a stress on
the body – so is pain. Over time, as my health condition became much more challenging,
I took over-the-counter pain medications to help me sleep at night and always
got up during the night to take more when the drugs wore off. I alternated from
one type to another to minimize the potential for negative side effects and my
doctor frequently did blood tests since some of these drugs can cause serious
liver problems. I had become much less judgmental about pharmaceuticals, but
continued to be cautious, always preferring the natural route when possible. </p>
<p>One day, in
desperation to feel better, I finally decided to ask my beloved doctor if she
felt medical marijuana might help me. Over a year earlier, she had prescribed a
pharmaceutical drug to help me sleep at night and I acquiesced because the
constant pain and exhaustion were unrelenting. Eventually, over time, she added
two more drugs to my nightly regimen, all with the goal of a good night’s
sleep. Combined, the sleeping pill, painkiller, and muscle relaxant led to
better sleep than I had experienced in a long, long time. I knew that she was
focused on resolving the problems that caused my need for these drugs – always
seeing them as a short-term solution while she also treated me for sleep apnea
and with trigger point injections for muscle spasms. Nevertheless, my doctor
and I were both concerned about the addictive qualities of these pharmaceutical
drugs.</p>
<p>At the time of
this appointment with my doctor, which was about a year after she had first
prescribed the three drugs, I had been taking all of them much longer than she
had planned. But every attempt I made to go off even one of them would make
sleep more elusive. In addition, over time, my body had become tolerant to them
so they had stopped giving me the results I so desperately needed. Most nights
I woke up after about three hours and needed to take more pills. Then I would
be awake for an hour or two in the middle of the night while I waited for the
new round of drugs to kick in so I could get a bit more sleep before morning.</p>
<p>Knowing that I had
been on these drugs much longer than my doctor wanted, I gently treaded onto
the topic of medical marijuana with her. I greatly respect her for many reasons,
including her integrative approach of combining Western medicine with
alternative modalities and treatments. But I did not have any idea how she’d
answer this question and was surprised at her immediate and positive response,
almost as if it was she who brought up the subject of medical marijuana instead
of me.<span>  </span></p>
<p>My doctor smiled
and told me she liked the idea and thought it might help. She then told me that
she had a patient who was having excellent results with cannabis. She asked if
I knew it was available in capsules? No, I didn’t. But that was intriguing and
I really liked the idea because smoking a joint didn’t appeal to me. Taking a
capsule, now that’s easy! My doctor then gave me a referral to another doctor
from whom I got the official state medical marijuana recommendation, opening
the door to this whole new world and, most importantly, opening the door to
less pain and better sleep the very first night I tried it. </p>
<p>I was thrilled
that I was able to replace three pharmaceutical drugs with one little capsule
of cannabis extract. And that one little capsule worked <i>better </i>than the drugs. The more I studied cannabis, the more I
realized that in order to really understand it, I would have to set aside all
of the old negative stereotypes that I had heard all of my life. I searched
books and numerous websites and queried people who might be in the “know” for
the specific information that would help me understand how it works and why it
appears to be so much more efficacious in healing than hundreds of other
botanicals that are used around the planet. As I share some rather
extraordinary facts about this healing herb, I suggest that you rethink it too.
Even if you know a lot about marijuana, so much is changing that there’s a good
chance that you’ll find many new-to-you facts on these pages.</p>
<p>I learned that the
naturally-produced chemical compounds in cannabis bring balance and harmony to
all of the body’s systems. (I’ll discuss these chemicals in greater depth in
Chapter 7.) However, there’s no guarantee that two people with the same
diagnosis and the same symptoms will find the same cannabis product to be
equally efficacious. Each strain has a different chemical profile based on its
own unique genetics and the conditions in which it was grown – a different ratio
or proportion of the hundreds of the chemicals that are naturally produced by
the plant. The two most prominent chemicals are THC, the chemical that causes
the psychoactive “trip” or “high,” and CBD, which is considered to have many additional
healing benefits. Another variable that impacts the efficacy from individual to
individual is the fact that each body’s chemistry is different. Two people who
have the same diagnosis and the same symptoms may find that the same strain of
cannabis medicine is efficacious for both of them – or they may find greater
benefit from two very different strains. </p>
<p>About 18 months
into my medical cannabis adventure, I learned firsthand how different strains
can deliver quite different healing benefits. Up until that time, I was very
grateful for the benefits that I had received from a product that is high in
THC, the chemical that causes the psychoactive “trip” or “high” that many
associate with cannabis. Because this product helped to quell the pain
associated with muscle spasms, it also improved my sleep. And I fully expected
that, over time, I would experience more symptom relief and a greater level of
healing overall. </p>
<p>While many
pharmaceutical drugs focus <i>only</i> on
symptom relief, a medicinal herb sometimes goes beyond symptom relief as it heals
the body on a deeper level. This deep-healing potential can take time – but
most of us are willing to be patient as we welcome the trajectory of feeling
better and better over time. However, sometimes herbs surprise us by delivering
fast results. And, from my perspective, there’s another factor behind all
healing. Beyond the realm of medicines and treatments, as a spiritual counselor
I want to point out that, from a mind-body-spirit perspective, healing doesn’t
have to take time. Like me, you have probably heard stories of healings that
have no explanation other than miraculous. I simply ask you to consider the
possibility that if one person can tap into a miraculous healing, you can too.<a href=""#_edn1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p><a href=""#_edn1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></a>When I heard media
reports of the amazing healing benefits that <i>some </i>patients experienced with newly available strains that are extremely
low in THC and high in CBD, I wanted to try one of them. I was primarily
interested because extremely-high CBD products do not cause psychoactivity like
THC does. The lack of psychoactivity can be helpful for any patient who finds
that the high or stoned feeling from THC makes it difficult to fully function
during the day. But for me there was another factor as well. My legs are a bit
wobbly due to the condition I’ve been diagnosed with – and THC makes them more
wobbly. So, up until that time, symptom relief during the day had eluded me –
and, with rare exceptions, I took cannabis at bedtime only. </p>
<p>Most people find
that their body builds a tolerance to the psychoactive effects of THC when they
continually take it over a period of time – so they don’t get as high as in the
past. However, I’m one of the rare individuals who has achieved very little
tolerance to the THC in cannabis. Even after a couple of years, more than a
tiny amount of THC makes me too wobbly to feel safe using it in the daytime. </p>
<p>I
didn’t really expect anything miraculous from this new cannabis product; I just
wanted a product that would help quell symptoms during the day. What happened
was a big surprise. The day after I started taking the high-CBD, extremely
low-THC product, I didn’t cough. In addition to other symptoms, a chronic
debilitating cough had plagued me for 25 years – but that day I woke up and <i>didn’t cough at all</i>. A number of doctors
had attempted to treat this cough over the years; however, without any success.
Eventually, I found a nutritional supplement that lessened the frequency of the
cough by about fifty percent; however, it was still a daily problem. </p>
<p>Since
the two different products – made from different strains of cannabis, and manufactured
by different companies – helped me in different ways, I started taking both on
a daily basis. At that point, I had already written the first draft of this
book and had done a ton of research. I had also seen dramatic reports on
television documentaries of very sick children getting absolutely no relief
from medical cannabis – <i>until </i>they
were given a very specific strain that proved to be almost miraculous from the
very first dose onward. I knew – at least I knew <i>intellectually</i> – that each strain has different healing benefit.</p>
<p>The new high-CBD
capsule product didn’t help with muscle spasms and pain – so using it as my
only cannabis medicine wasn’t an option. But the fast and dramatic improvement
in the cough astounded me. Clearly, the particular chemical profile of that
cannabis product gave me a different set of benefits from the high-THC product.
That experience really opened my eyes and helped me understand how important it
is to experiment with different forms and types of cannabis even if you think
you are already being helped as much as possible. Remember, different strains
have different benefits. That’s why it is helpful to consult with doctors and
other experts who are knowledgeable about cannabis, try new strains and new
products, and experiment with dosage in order to get the most healing benefit
possible. </p>
<p>Much more
recently, I have been able to obtain capsules that contain raw cannabis oil
that does not cause any psychoactivity for me, so I can take them any time of
the day or night without feeling groggy, wobbly, or at all high. This raw
cannabis oil is the best product yet for me for symptom relief. It is
considered “raw” because it is manufactured through a cold processing method –
which means that it is non-psychoactive, except in rare cases. That’s because
almost all of the THC that it would normally contain is present in a different
chemical form called tetrahydrocannabinolic <i>acid</i>
or <i>THCa</i>, a biosynthetic precursor to
THC<i>. </i>Note that the “a” at the end of
THCa stands for “acid.” When cannabis is exposed to heat, a process called
decarboxylation converts the THCa to THC. But, as long as it is raw, it
contains THCa, which has its own set of healing and symptom relief benefits,
different from those of THC, giving any raw cannabis product additional
advantages. Raw cannabis also contains a precursor form of CBD called CBDa,
which provides different benefits from those of CBD. (Please note that most raw
cannabis products DO contain <i>small </i>amounts
of THC and CBD, but they are often so small that they may not be quantifiable.)</p>
<p>Some months ago I
asked a greatly respected medical marijuana expert what he recommended for the
condition I have been diagnosed with. He suggested a 2:1 ratio of CBD to THC –
and my hunt ensued. While there are many medical cannabis products on the
market, at the time I wasn’t able to locate any that were a 2:1 CBD to THC. In that
situation, the only option is to try products that come closest. At the time, the
closest I found was a 3:1 product – but it didn’t provide symptom relief. In the world of medical marijuana, a lack of
success doesn’t necessarily mean the recommendation is wrong; it may mean that
you need to give the product more time and/or tweak your protocol. Or it’s
possible that it’s not the best product for you and it’s best to look for a
different one.</p>
<p>As you’ll learn in
more detail in later chapters, two different products that contain the exact <i>same </i>ratio of CBD and THC may give you very
different results. That’s because, in addition to the CBD and THC, there are
many other factors involved in any one product’s efficacy, including its
potency, the dosage taken, and the hundreds of other chemicals in the plant which
are present in smaller amounts – and in different ratios in each strain. </p>
<p>I was delighted
when I obtained the raw cannabis oil capsules that I mentioned above, which is
a 3:1 CBDa to THCa product. This product gives me the most symptom relief
during the daytime of any products I have yet tried. Even though it’s not in
the 2:1 CBD to THC ratio that was recommended to me, it is the closest I have obtained
so far in a product that actually <i>helps </i>me.
I appreciate the benefits that I am getting from this raw oil product – no psychoactivity
<i>and</i> CBDa and THCa, which bring their
own unique benefits. Like many patients, I have also learned to “tweak” my
protocol by combining products. For example, a small amount of a high-THC
product along with the 3:1 CBDa to THCa product is closer to the recommended
2:1 CBD to THC ratio than either product on its own. That combination seems to
provide a bit more symptom relief and, I find that when I take a small amount
of THC <i>along with </i>high-CBD product, the
psychoactivity is lessened. </p>
<p>I continue to take
a high-THC product at nighttime since, otherwise, muscle spasms and pain tend
to keep me awake most of the night.</p>
<p><span>  </span></p>
<p><b>Your Brain Produces Its Own Marijuana</b></p>
<p>I’ve written about
holistic health for over three decades and thought I knew a few things on the
subject. However, I was in for a surprise when I learned one of the main
reasons that scientists believe that cannabis is so healing: <b>In the 1990s, researchers discovered that
there are natural chemical compounds in cannabis that match receptors in the
cells of our own bodies – referred to as “Your Brain’s Own Marijuana” in the
title of a <i>Scientific American </i>article<i>. </i></b>Many believe that it is this link
between the chemicals in the plant and those in the cells of our own bodies
that makes cannabis so unique, so good at quelling symptoms and, in some cases,
also bringing healing to health problems in the body and mind. In fact, the
cells in the body that are a match for the <i>cannabinoids
</i>in the cannabis plant were named <i>endocannabinoids. ...<br/></i></p>A
healthy immune system supports the body’s individual cells as they <span>repair themselves or replace themselves when
they are damaged. Receptors, which are structures located on the surface
of a cell or inside a cell – such as enzymes, neurotransmitters, or viruses –
are a vital part of this “repair or replace” process. They act like receivers
and give instructions to the cells to take a specific action, such as dividing,
dying and replacing themselves, or allowing a specific substance into the cell
or out of the cell. All of these actions occur constantly in the body as a
process of normal cell functions.<br/><br/></span>
<p>Different strains
of cannabis target different receptors in the body. Receptor sites on the
surface of cells can lock onto certain molecules when they come along,
basically working like locks and keys. Just like the front door of your home, a
receptor can only be unlocked by a key that fits into that specific type of
lock. In this “lock and key” system, a key that “matches” a lock then carries a
signal through the cell’s wall. Let’s look at the example of a receptor on the
surface of a cell that can act as a messenger for the sensation of pain. There
is a unique place on the surface of the cell where this receptor can dock. When
the pain receptor docks on the cell, it’s like a key that fits into the lock
and it then activates the pain signal. However, if the receptor is blocked, the
pain signal does not get through. Without the receptor, there’s no key to unlock
the door, so the sensation of pain does not occur because the “door” remains
locked. Many pharmaceutical drugs work by blocking specific receptors. For
example, when a person takes a pain-relieving drug, the drug stops the pain
receptor from activating and the person no longer feels the pain. ...<a href=""#_edn3"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></a> </p>
<p>Until recently,
cannabis was the only plant in which receptors that match our internal
endocannabinoids had been found, making this herb incredibly unique and special.
However, it didn’t make sense to me that there would be only one plant on this
vast planet that was a match for our human endocannabinoid receptors. So I
wasn’t surprised to find new research that indicates that chemicals from plants
<i>other than cannabis</i> also directly
interact with CB1 and/or CB2 receptors or have a chemical profile that is
similar to the cannabinoids in cannabis. While research on this subject is in
its infancy, the herb Echinacea has been found to be a match for some CB1 and
CB2 receptors, with other plants also being investigated for their roles in
promoting wellness via the human endocannabinoid system. <a rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></a> Meanwhile, some new
products combine cannabis and other healing botanicals such as Echinacea to
increase the effects and curative properties of both herbs. </p>
<p>In Chapter 4 we
will look at the connection between these receptors in the cells and the
healing properties of cannabis that make it so powerful in healing bodily
conditions.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>The Role of Cannabis in Promoting Homeostasis</b></p>
<p>There’s a lot
going on in your body simultaneously; it is set up for balance and harmony,
with a goal of promoting maximum wellness. The body’s constant effort to
maintain equilibrium among all of its internal processes and systems is called <i>homeostasis</i>, which the <i>Merriam Webster Dictionary</i> defines as “the
maintenance of relatively stable internal physiological conditions (as body
temperature or the pH of blood) in higher animals under fluctuating
environmental conditions.”<a href=""#_edn6"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span><span> </span></span></span></span></a>Early on in my research I learned that
cannabis has some pretty awesome healing properties that promote this important
function in the body.</p>
<p>As the body pursues
optimal harmony and balance through homeostasis, it is constantly in the
process of compensating. When one process or system is out of balance, another
process or system compensates for the system that is not fully functioning. One
example is the body’s ability to regulate temperature. As the body gets too hot
or too cold, it will compensate to deal with the change in temperature. That’s
why you sweat on a hot day; it’s the body’s way of cooling down. </p>
<p>The “repair and
replace” mechanism within all of the cells in your body is also part of
homeostasis. In fact, in the second that it took you to read this sentence,
thousands of your cells have been automatically repaired or replaced with new
cells. The body’s intelligence is mind-blowing and its ability to prioritize is
what homeostasis is all about.</p>
<p>Imbalances in any
of your body’s systems throw it off balance and out of whack and require
compensating systems to restore balance. For most of us, these compensating
mechanisms kick in automatically and keep us healthy, especially when we are
young. If we get a cold or flu, our immune system goes to work and we are soon
well again. If there is a toxin in the air, the body compensates, handles it,
and we don’t even know about it because the body is programmed for wellness. It
automatically compensates over and over to insure survival with the very best
outcome. That is, unless it is overwhelmed and unable to handle the challenges
that come its way, including infections, parasites, and environmental toxins.
And, in addition to the tangible challenges that we deal with in the physical
world, emotional traumas and negative thinking can also impact the body
chemistry in negative ways and impact our health.</p>
<p>So how does
homeostasis fit into the scheme of things when the subject is cannabis? Well,
anything that helps the body deal with its imbalances will help it get back
into homeostasis. While the ratios of the chemical compounds in cannabis vary
from strain to strain, scientists have discovered a wide range of positive
effects from these healing chemicals, including effects that are <span>anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, anti-epileptic,
anti-ischemic, anti-diabetic, anti-psychotic, anti-nausea, anti-spasmodic,
antibiotic, anti-anxiety, anti-depressant, and anti-neoplastic (inhibiting
development of malignant cells).</span></p>
<p>Even knowing all
of this, it took a while for me to understand why cannabis is so significant
and powerful – and why its healing properties are utilized by our bodies to
such an amazing extent. Cannabis truly has a special and unique place in the
world of botanicals. I frequently refer to it as a sacred healing herb because
of the reverence I have for this gift from Nature. I will share lots more in
these chapters about <i>why </i>and you will
understand the reasons many doctors and other health professionals are now
recommending cannabis to patients.<span>  </span></p>
<p>Most medicinal
herbs give us results over a period of time; their action is usually not very
fast and we might not feel the beneficial effects for days, weeks, or even
months. That is why it is important to give medicinal herbs time to do their
work and not give up on them too soon. It is okay that it takes time because we
understand that medicinal herbs heal on a causal basis. One of my mentors
recently used the term “softer” to describe the healing we receive from herbs
and many other holistic modalities. I liked that terminology because I believe
herbs heal on a deeper level than pharmaceuticals – and that does feel softer
to me. When we take a medicinal herb that benefits our body, it does so by
getting to the root of problems and restoring balance. </p>
<p>Cannabis is
considered to be a superhero in the world of medicinal herbs because of the
positive side benefits that many patients experience. While it can take time
for a major health issue to be resolved, most patients feel some of the
beneficial effects of cannabis almost immediately, especially if they are
astute in noticing their body’s responses. For example, you might immediately
notice deeper, more relaxed breathing, and more relaxation in the muscles and
skeletal system, which can result in better sleep, fewer bathroom visits during
the night, improved lung function, and/or greater endurance and stamina.
Cannabis can also quickly boost a patient’s mental attitude and it is known for
giving quick relief to those suffering from nausea or lack of appetite. </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Contradictory and Confusing Perspectives from the
Powers That Be </b></p>
<p>Like so many
others before me, once I had the official paper in my hand in which my state
government sanctioned my right to use an ancient healing herb – without too
much concern at that point in time of being arrested – I entered the maze. I
was a stranger in a strange land. I had many questions: Where do I get the
marijuana; what form of marijuana should I take (including smoking, vaporizing,
capsules, edibles, suppositories, creams, salves, and other forms); what strain
or type should I chose; what potency is right for me; and how often should I
take it? Unless we have a knowledgeable physician or other ally, these are
among the questions that we must all answer for ourselves. In most cases, we
are expected to figure out a lot of details in this new and somewhat strange
world and decide what is right for us as individuals. In fact, as of this
writing, doctors in some jurisdictions are not allowed to tell you anything
about it.</p>
<p>One has to be
discerning and at least somewhat knowledgeable in order to sift through the
mounds of dated, inaccurate, and biased information about cannabis that is
presented as truth in books and on the Internet. One of the reasons for this
glut of outdated, incorrect, and obviously skewed data was presented by Dr.
Gupta on his CNN special, <i>Weed</i>. He
reported that there have been over 20,000 studies on cannabis in the last
couple of decades; however almost all of them – 94 percent – were focused on
studying the deleterious effects and harm caused by marijuana, while only six
percent of the studies were focused on the benefits.<span>  </span></p>
<p>The
biggest shock in the U.S. “war” against cannabis is that one branch of the
government says cannabis has <i>no medicinal
value</i> while, at the same time, a different branch of the U.S. federal
government patented the cannabinoid CBD <i>for
its medicinal value</i>. Clearly, there is a huge amount of evidence that
cannabis has great medicinal value for an untold number of illnesses and
conditions. But, as of this writing, the government still controls cannabis
research in the U.S. and has allowed an extremely limited amount to be done,
with most of it focused on <i>disproving</i>
the medicinal value of marijuana. As a result, most doctors still refuse to
recommend it due to the lack of “clinical trials.” It’s a Catch-22. The federal
government does not allow clinical trials and, at the same time, argues that
only clinical trials can establish proof of a medicinal value. As a result, to
date, very few medical cannabis patients have a professional healthcare
provider alongside them on their medical marijuana journey.</p>
<p>Anyone who knows
how scientific studies are set up understands that it can be challenging to set
up a totally unbiased study. If you want to study “deleterious effects and harm
from marijuana,” that is what you are looking for – and it is likely that you
will set up your research to focus on that. On the other hand, if you want to
study “benefits from marijuana,” you will set up a study to give you data that
proves the benefits of the herb. Unfortunately, for most of the last century,
the U.S. government rarely looked for anything good about marijuana. The
majority of the studies were done by the National Institute of Drug Abuse, a
branch of the government that was focused almost exclusively on funding studies
that would continue to demonize cannabis as a dangerous drug. Interestingly,
some of the very top medical doctors who now promote cannabis as an important
medicine were originally involved in research to debunk its medical benefits
and were converted to when their studies proved its great merits. Within these
chapters you will read about a couple of them. </p>
<p>Most of us have
been brainwashed about the evils of “weed” all of our lives. Governments
branded it as dangerous and made it illegal. In the U.S., the Justice
Department put it on Schedule I of the <span>Controlled
Substances Act, which means it has <i>no
medicinal value </i>and it is one of the most dangerous drugs available. The
irony is that while some government agencies continue to view cannabis as a
dangerous, illegal drug, other government agencies are well aware of its
medicinal value. While people were still being thrown into prison for
distributing or using marijuana for medicinal purposes, the government
continued to run its own medical marijuana program out of the University of
Mississippi. That program, which began in 1976, provides free cannabis each
month to the patients who are enrolled in it. All these years later, patients
who were originally part of this program are still receiving free cannabis <i>from the United States government. </i></span></p>
<p>In
addition to the government’s own contradictory marijuana giveaway program, the
craziness continued when the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
obtained a patent on cannabinoids for their antioxidant and neuroprotective
properties. Does this make sense – one government agency tells us that cannabis
is a dangerous and illegal <span>Schedule I drug, with <i>no medicinal value</i>, while another
government agency not only acknowledges its medicinal value but also obtains a
patent for it? Now how is that possible, you might ask? Isn’t it impossible to
patent a plant? Apparently the U.S. federal government can do the impossible.</span></p>
<p>The abstract of
U.S. Patent 6630507, entitled “Cannabinoids as Antioxidants and
Neuroprotectants,” tells us exactly what <span>the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services believes to be true about cannabis and its
chemical compounds, cannabinoids. It says, in part:  </span></p>
<p>""Cannabinoids
have been found to have antioxidant properties…. This new found property makes
cannabinoids useful in the treatment and prophylaxis of a wide variety of
oxidation associated diseases, such as ischemic, age-related, inflammatory and
autoimmune diseases. The cannabinoids are found to have particular application
as neuroprotectants, for example in limiting neurological damage following ischemic
insults, such as stroke and trauma, or in the treatment of neurodegenerative
diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and HIV dementia.""<a href=""#_edn9"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></a> </p>
<p>I am also
fascinated by the section in the patent entitled “Detailed Description of Some
Specific Embodiments,” which discusses more of what this “invention” – in this
case, “compounds” found in the herb cannabis – provide to the body:<span>  </span></p>
<p>""This
invention provides antioxidant compounds and compositions, such as
pharmaceutical compositions, that include cannabinoids that act as free radical
scavengers for use in prophylaxis and treatment of disease. The invention also
includes methods for using the antioxidants in prevention and treatment of
pathological conditions such as ischemia (tissue hypoxia), and in subjects who
have been exposed to oxidant inducing agents such as cancer chemotherapy,
toxins, radiation, or other sources of oxidative stress. The compositions and
methods described herein are also used for preventing oxidative damage in
transplanted organs, for inhibiting reoxygenation injury following reperfusion
of ischemic tissues (for example in heart disease), and for any other condition
that is mediated by oxidative or free radical mechanisms of injury. In
particular embodiments of the invention, the compounds and compositions are
used in the treatment of ischemic cardiovascular and neurovascular conditions,
and neurodegenerative diseases. However the present invention can also be used
as an antioxidant treatment in non-neurological diseases.""<a rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>In addition to
this patent, a number of other patents have been granted by the U.S. government
for the medicinal value of cannabis, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>U.S. Patent 20130059018: PhytoCannabinoids in the treatment of cancer</p></li>
<li><p>U.S. Patent 5,538,993:
Compounds according to the
present invention are characterized by various beneficial properties such as
analgesic, anti-emetic, sedative, anti-inflammatory, anti-glaucoma, and
neuroprotective activities</p></li>
<li><p>U.S. Patent 6,448,288: Use of

<li><p>U.S. Patent 4,876,276: Special use in cases of acute and of chronic pain</p></li>
<li><p>U.S. Patent 7,179,800: Useful for therapy, especially in the treatment of pain, inflammation

</ul>
<h3><b>
</b></h3>
<p>Clearly the U.S.
government knows that cannabis is actually a safe, effective, and inexpensive
medicine; not a dangerous drug with no medicinal value, as the Drug Enforcement
Administration has classified it for so long. </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>A New Look at Old Stereotypes</b></p>
<p>Now let’s look at
a couple of the stereotypes about cannabis. The stereotype that cannabis causes
the “munchies” and leads to overeating may be true for some people when they
take <i>some cannabis products.</i> But –
again – it depends on the strain and the individual. Some people who are
overweight lose weight with no effort on medical cannabis – while those who are
underweight are often successful in gaining weight. </p>
<p>I have been
overweight for most of my life. Even though I had dropped quite a bit of weight
a few years earlier using a nutritional supplement and doing emotional healing
work, at the point in time that I started taking cannabis, I was still
overweight and had been stuck on a plateau for a couple of years. For the first
six months or so that I took cannabis, I didn’t gain or lose weight. But then,
after I started taking a high-potency <i>cannabis
oil</i> product, which is now manufactured under the name Natur-Oil, I started
losing weight with no effort at all at the rate of one to three pounds a month
until I had lost about 30 pounds. I know that cannabis can help to balance the
blood sugar and I assume that is one of the many ways it has helped in my body.
Instead of getting the “munchies” and overeating, cannabis curbed my appetite
and my desire for sweets and carbs. I didn’t diet, eliminate or limit any
foods, or exercise more. I ate whatever I wanted and enjoyed every bite of
everything I chose to eat, including sweets and carbs, finding that my body
only wanted small amounts of them. That made weight loss easy. I was still
rather shocked on those occasions when I didn’t even want a small serving of a
yummy-looking dessert that was offered to me – but the fact that I didn’t WANT
it and passed on it for that reason felt really good. I have continued on this
trajectory – and I now feel that I’m “eating to live,” rather than “living to
eat.”<span>  </span></p>
<p>Another stereotype
that’s prevalent among the public is that anyone who uses medical cannabis is a
slacker who “just wants to get stoned.” I’m okay with people getting stoned if
that is their choice, as long as they are responsible about it, but that is not
my desire. My experience is that getting high is NOT the preference of most
medical marijuana patients. Our goal is not to get high; our goal is to heal.
Thankfully, as I mentioned above, for those of us for whom the high is
undesirable, newer strains and forms of non-psychoactive cannabis are now
available. </p>

</div></div>","Medical Marijuana changed my life. Help me get the word out about
 why this herb is so amazing – and learn how it may help you or your loved one. 

 I wrote The Medical Marijuana Handbook:  A Patient's Guide to Holistic Healing with Cannabis  to
help patients navigate the often confusing maze that is the world of medical
marijuana – and I am asking your help to get it published.  Medical marijuana has helped me cope
with symptoms from a chronic lifelong condition far better than any pharmaceuticals I’ve used –  and I want everyone to
know about this option for symptom relief and for healing. 
Over the past few decades, I've coauthored 12 books with experts on holistic health, stress management, brain optimization, and other topics.  And now I'm passionate about telling everyone about the awesomeness of medical marijuana!  I wrote this book because I want other patients to understand the many 
complexities of this herb, including WHY scientists believe it works so 
well for so many. 
Most of the perks offered in this campaign include, in essence, the pre-purchase of  copies of the book, which will be sent when it is published in September.  Additionally, ALL contributors will receive a PDF of 3 chapters for FREE right away.  AND I have included part of Chapter 1 at the end of this campaign page so you don't have to wait to plunge in!
Since my goal is to educate the entire world on this topic – especially health professionals, politicians, and educators – some perks also include my ""Get One, Give One"" program in which contributors will be helping me send free copies of the book to thought leaders.  




When I first tried medical marijuana, I was desperate for something that would help ease the pain and 
discomfort
of my physical symptoms and not be addictive like the prescription drugs
 I was taking.  Those drugs had ceased being effective – and I
did not want to take stronger drugs,
which came with an increasing number of scary potential side effects. I was immediately surprised at HOW effective it was – and disappointed that I hadn’t tried it
sooner. Medical marijuana quickly became my lifeline to greater well-being. 
Medical marijuana is constantly in the news these days—and yet
when I talk to friends and family, as well as doctors, I find that few understand
what it really is, what it really does,
and WHY it is so effective for so many.  Many questions arise when starting on this journey, including: 


Why should I
consider medical marijuana, and is it right for me?

What health
issues can be helped by it?


What makes it
such a potent healing herb?

How and where
do I legally get the marijuana? 

What strain,
what form, what potency, and what dose is right for me?  


What do I tell
the kids about taking something that they’ve been told is illegal and wrong?


Unless
we have a knowledgeable ally, most patients must answer these questions for
ourselves—often, all on our own. In fact, in some jurisdictions, doctors aren’t allowed 
to tell you anything about medical marijuana.


Medical cannabis can help with these issues:




Decrease pain and inflammation 

Soothe nausea

Treat muscle spasms


Reduce anxiety


Stimulate appetite 

Induce better and more restful sleep

and so much more…

Who can be
helped by medical cannabis? 




Patients with acute health conditions that are life
     threatening.
     Cannabis has been shown to provide symptom relief for many patients and,
     for some, actual improvement in severe life-threatening health challenges.
     


Patients
     with chronic health issues. 
Many patients find that symptoms of
     chronic health concerns are quelled by cannabis, without the negative side
     effects of other medications.


Patients
     with sporadic health issues or injuries.
     Cannabis is also found to be efficacious for many common symptoms, such as
     pain, anxiety, difficulty sleeping, nausea, etc.



Health-conscious
     individuals who want to stimulate their body’s internal healing system
     with a regular maintenance dose of cannabis. 
Cannabis helps modulate or balance
     every human physiological system, including regulating immunity,
     inflammation, neurotoxicity, blood pressure, appetite, gastrointestinal
     function, and intraocular pressure. Therefore, many health-conscious
     individuals desire a small maintenance dose of medical cannabis to promote
     health and wellbeing.




Clearing Up the Confusion Around Medical Marijuana ...

The world of medical marijuana is filled with unfamiliar terminology, numerous types of cannabis products to choose from, and very little specific direction on the best options for each patient. One
has to be discerning and at least somewhat knowledgeable in order to sift
through the mounds of information that is presented as ""truth"" in books, articles and the Internet—a great deal of which is outdated,
inaccurate, or biased. Most people tend to think of medical marijuana as one
specific medicine, which gets you high, when in reality each strain of cannabis
is, in some ways, a different medicine from every other strain.  Treatment
options now include non-psychoactive (no ""high""), smokeless, and
topical forms and formulations of cannabis, with many new strains
continually being created and bred for their specific healing qualities.

I
wrote The Medical Marijuana Handbook to answer your questions, soothe your
concerns, and give you the information you—or a family member or friend—need in
order to make informed decisions and effectively use medical marijuana. I
literally walk you by the hand through all that you need to know, drawing not only
from my own experience and research, but from interviews I’ve conducted with
health professionals, medical cannabis experts, and other patients. I’ve worked
hard to make sure this information is as up-to-date and accurate as possible. Even if you know a lot about cannabis, so much
is changing that there’s a good chance you’ll find many new-to-you facts in my
book. 






Here's What Leading-Edge Medical Doctors Say About Medical Cannabis



Dr. Sanjay Gupta: In a 2013 article entitled “Why I
Changed My Mind on Weed,” Dr. Gupta totally reversed his previous stand against
medical marijuana. He now says that cannabis has “very legitimate medical
applications” and “sometimes it’s the only thing that works.” CNN.com; August 9, 2013
Dr. Mehmet
Oz:""I grew up like most of
my generation believing that marijuana was something Satan was throwing at
Americans, a communist plot. But I think most of us have come around to believe
that marijuana is hugely beneficial when used correctly for medicinal
purposes,"" Larry King
Live, CNN, May 12, 2014
Dr. Lester
Grinspoon, Emeritus Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School: “…
[marijuana] is extraordinarily safe – safer than most medicines prescribed
every day. If marijuana were a new discovery rather than a well-known substance
carrying cultural and political baggage, it would be hailed as a wonder drug.” “Marijuana
as Wonder Drug,” Boston Globe, March 1, 2007 

What It Will Take to Publish The Medical Marijuana Handbook



My book is fully written and in the stages of production. It is a
full-length book of approximately 75,000 words and will be published by September,
2015.  My goal is to raise $35,000 to publish and launch The
Medical Marijuana Handbook. Publishing costs of $20,000 include editing,
interior design and formatting for both print and eBooks, cover art, printing, and shipping.
Marketing costs of $15,000 include a website, short promotional videos for
YouTube, and book launch expenses.  

Stretch Goals


As I want to get this information into the hands of as many people as
possible, a stretch goal of $50,000 would allow me to hire a PR firm and
do some local and national advertising to raise awareness of the healing
properties of this amazing herb, help remove some of the stigma attached to it,
and get my book into the hands of the people who most need it.  
My dream is to place a full-page ad in The New York Times, and
through that ad give free eBook copies of The Medical Marijuana Handbook
to as many people as possible to help educate them about cannabis medicine.
Of course, like any New York real estate, a full-page ad comes with a high
price tag. So if I reach a stretch goal of $100,000, look out New York
Times! 
I envision my book in the hands of thought leaders –  health professionals, politicians, members of the judiciary, and educators – because I believe it will help them understand WHY cannabis should be available to all patients. Okay, so you may be thinking that getting the book into the hands of influential people doesn't mean they will read it.  And that's true.  They may not read the book, but maybe one of their relatives, their neighbors, or their coworkers WILL read it.  Each person who becomes educated about the truth of cannabis medicine helps to tip the balance a bit more for all of us.  And that brings us closer to a world in which the herb is available to all.
Please join me and together we will raise awareness. The more you know, the more you can help others understand!
The money raised from this campaign will enable me to roll The Medical
Marijuana Handbook out in a way this important topic deserves.

Sample Excerpt

Chapter
1: Welcome to the World of Medical Marijuana (partial)
Note: Space on this page doesn't allow me to share this entire chapter, so I'm excerpting only part of it here.


When I first
became a medical marijuana patient, I was shocked at how effective it was at quelling
symptoms that I’ve suffered with for years. The results I experienced, from the
very first day I took it, were dramatic. I’d heard lots of great things about medical
marijuana over the years but I really didn’t expect it to be that beneficial. 

As medical
cannabis quickly became my lifeline to greater well-being, I realized that I had
been stuck in stereotypes fostered by decades of slanted and incorrect ideas
about this gift from Nature – and I started to see it as the miracle herb that
so many people have long proclaimed it to be.I was curious
about why it was so effective for me and disappointed that I hadn’t tried it
sooner – so I began to research this much maligned herb. The more I learned
about marijuana, the more complex – and fascinating and unique – it was. I
found myself navigating a confusing maze that was filled with unfamiliar
terminology, numerous types of cannabis products to choose from, and very
little specific direction on the best options for me. 
Marijuana has been
called a sacred herb, a super-herb, a Goddess herb, a master herb. Nature made
it unique among all of her offerings. As with other herbs and plants, it is
imbued with compounds that work together synergistically. However, it is
distinguished in the world of botanicals because no other plant seems to have
so many wide-ranging, health-promoting qualities. Hundreds of studies around
the world, many of them within the last two decades, confirm a huge number of
beneficial effects that marijuana has on the body and, in some cases, also the
mind. 
Among
the many things I learned is that most of the medicinal strains of cannabis are
very different from the strains that recreational users prefer. And that makes
sense. The recreational user’s goal is generally to achieve the psychoactive
“high” or “stoned feeling” that most people associate with it, while – for many
medicinal cannabis patients – the “high” is an unwanted side effect. 

My Experience Becoming a Medical Marijuana Patient
As a resident of
California with verified medical needs, I could have qualified as a medical
marijuana patient when it first became legal in the state in 1996. But, like
many others, I didn’t pursue it because the federal government continued to
wage a war on this amazing herb. Over those years, many Californians learned
the hard way that their state law didn’t protect them from seizure and
prosecution by the federal government. Many growers, dispensary owners, patients,
and parents of patients who are minors ended up in prison, with a criminal
record for the rest of their lives. News reports of those incidents scared many
potential patients – like me – away from even trying this herb. As of this
writing, news stories of these “crackdowns,” including seizures and arrests,
still occur throughout the world, although not nearly as often. Thankfully, the
situation is improving and cannabis is now available to many patients who have
not had access to it in the past.
As I continued to
study cannabis as a medicine, I was shocked to learn so much that I didn’t know
– but felt I should have known. I
have written on holistic health and complementary modalities off and on for
several decades and I thought I actually knew quite a bit about these topics,
including the subject of herbal medicine. My personal health choices have
always veered away from pharmaceutical drugs as much as possible, preferring
the most natural and holistic treatments to the potential negative side effects
that are part and parcel of most pharmaceuticals. At one point in time, I
didn’t even have a pain reliever like aspirin in my house because I didn’t want
to take pharmaceutical drugs unless I felt it was needed as a last resort. Then
I came to understand that – just as the side effects of a drug are a stress on
the body – so is pain. Over time, as my health condition became much more challenging,
I took over-the-counter pain medications to help me sleep at night and always
got up during the night to take more when the drugs wore off. I alternated from
one type to another to minimize the potential for negative side effects and my
doctor frequently did blood tests since some of these drugs can cause serious
liver problems. I had become much less judgmental about pharmaceuticals, but
continued to be cautious, always preferring the natural route when possible. 
One day, in
desperation to feel better, I finally decided to ask my beloved doctor if she
felt medical marijuana might help me. Over a year earlier, she had prescribed a
pharmaceutical drug to help me sleep at night and I acquiesced because the
constant pain and exhaustion were unrelenting. Eventually, over time, she added
two more drugs to my nightly regimen, all with the goal of a good night’s
sleep. Combined, the sleeping pill, painkiller, and muscle relaxant led to
better sleep than I had experienced in a long, long time. I knew that she was
focused on resolving the problems that caused my need for these drugs – always
seeing them as a short-term solution while she also treated me for sleep apnea
and with trigger point injections for muscle spasms. Nevertheless, my doctor
and I were both concerned about the addictive qualities of these pharmaceutical
drugs.
At the time of
this appointment with my doctor, which was about a year after she had first
prescribed the three drugs, I had been taking all of them much longer than she
had planned. But every attempt I made to go off even one of them would make
sleep more elusive. In addition, over time, my body had become tolerant to them
so they had stopped giving me the results I so desperately needed. Most nights
I woke up after about three hours and needed to take more pills. Then I would
be awake for an hour or two in the middle of the night while I waited for the
new round of drugs to kick in so I could get a bit more sleep before morning.
Knowing that I had
been on these drugs much longer than my doctor wanted, I gently treaded onto
the topic of medical marijuana with her. I greatly respect her for many reasons,
including her integrative approach of combining Western medicine with
alternative modalities and treatments. But I did not have any idea how she’d
answer this question and was surprised at her immediate and positive response,
almost as if it was she who brought up the subject of medical marijuana instead
of me.  
My doctor smiled
and told me she liked the idea and thought it might help. She then told me that
she had a patient who was having excellent results with cannabis. She asked if
I knew it was available in capsules? No, I didn’t. But that was intriguing and
I really liked the idea because smoking a joint didn’t appeal to me. Taking a
capsule, now that’s easy! My doctor then gave me a referral to another doctor
from whom I got the official state medical marijuana recommendation, opening
the door to this whole new world and, most importantly, opening the door to
less pain and better sleep the very first night I tried it. 
I was thrilled
that I was able to replace three pharmaceutical drugs with one little capsule
of cannabis extract. And that one little capsule worked better than the drugs. The more I studied cannabis, the more I
realized that in order to really understand it, I would have to set aside all
of the old negative stereotypes that I had heard all of my life. I searched
books and numerous websites and queried people who might be in the “know” for
the specific information that would help me understand how it works and why it
appears to be so much more efficacious in healing than hundreds of other
botanicals that are used around the planet. As I share some rather
extraordinary facts about this healing herb, I suggest that you rethink it too.
Even if you know a lot about marijuana, so much is changing that there’s a good
chance that you’ll find many new-to-you facts on these pages.
I learned that the
naturally-produced chemical compounds in cannabis bring balance and harmony to
all of the body’s systems. (I’ll discuss these chemicals in greater depth in
Chapter 7.) However, there’s no guarantee that two people with the same
diagnosis and the same symptoms will find the same cannabis product to be
equally efficacious. Each strain has a different chemical profile based on its
own unique genetics and the conditions in which it was grown – a different ratio
or proportion of the hundreds of the chemicals that are naturally produced by
the plant. The two most prominent chemicals are THC, the chemical that causes
the psychoactive “trip” or “high,” and CBD, which is considered to have many additional
healing benefits. Another variable that impacts the efficacy from individual to
individual is the fact that each body’s chemistry is different. Two people who
have the same diagnosis and the same symptoms may find that the same strain of
cannabis medicine is efficacious for both of them – or they may find greater
benefit from two very different strains. 
About 18 months
into my medical cannabis adventure, I learned firsthand how different strains
can deliver quite different healing benefits. Up until that time, I was very
grateful for the benefits that I had received from a product that is high in
THC, the chemical that causes the psychoactive “trip” or “high” that many
associate with cannabis. Because this product helped to quell the pain
associated with muscle spasms, it also improved my sleep. And I fully expected
that, over time, I would experience more symptom relief and a greater level of
healing overall. 
While many
pharmaceutical drugs focus only on
symptom relief, a medicinal herb sometimes goes beyond symptom relief as it heals
the body on a deeper level. This deep-healing potential can take time – but
most of us are willing to be patient as we welcome the trajectory of feeling
better and better over time. However, sometimes herbs surprise us by delivering
fast results. And, from my perspective, there’s another factor behind all
healing. Beyond the realm of medicines and treatments, as a spiritual counselor
I want to point out that, from a mind-body-spirit perspective, healing doesn’t
have to take time. Like me, you have probably heard stories of healings that
have no explanation other than miraculous. I simply ask you to consider the
possibility that if one person can tap into a miraculous healing, you can too.
When I heard media
reports of the amazing healing benefits that some patients experienced with newly available strains that are extremely
low in THC and high in CBD, I wanted to try one of them. I was primarily
interested because extremely-high CBD products do not cause psychoactivity like
THC does. The lack of psychoactivity can be helpful for any patient who finds
that the high or stoned feeling from THC makes it difficult to fully function
during the day. But for me there was another factor as well. My legs are a bit
wobbly due to the condition I’ve been diagnosed with – and THC makes them more
wobbly. So, up until that time, symptom relief during the day had eluded me –
and, with rare exceptions, I took cannabis at bedtime only. 
Most people find
that their body builds a tolerance to the psychoactive effects of THC when they
continually take it over a period of time – so they don’t get as high as in the
past. However, I’m one of the rare individuals who has achieved very little
tolerance to the THC in cannabis. Even after a couple of years, more than a
tiny amount of THC makes me too wobbly to feel safe using it in the daytime. 
I
didn’t really expect anything miraculous from this new cannabis product; I just
wanted a product that would help quell symptoms during the day. What happened
was a big surprise. The day after I started taking the high-CBD, extremely
low-THC product, I didn’t cough. In addition to other symptoms, a chronic
debilitating cough had plagued me for 25 years – but that day I woke up and didn’t cough at all. A number of doctors
had attempted to treat this cough over the years; however, without any success.
Eventually, I found a nutritional supplement that lessened the frequency of the
cough by about fifty percent; however, it was still a daily problem. 
Since
the two different products – made from different strains of cannabis, and manufactured
by different companies – helped me in different ways, I started taking both on
a daily basis. At that point, I had already written the first draft of this
book and had done a ton of research. I had also seen dramatic reports on
television documentaries of very sick children getting absolutely no relief
from medical cannabis – until they
were given a very specific strain that proved to be almost miraculous from the
very first dose onward. I knew – at least I knew intellectually – that each strain has different healing benefit.
The new high-CBD
capsule product didn’t help with muscle spasms and pain – so using it as my
only cannabis medicine wasn’t an option. But the fast and dramatic improvement
in the cough astounded me. Clearly, the particular chemical profile of that
cannabis product gave me a different set of benefits from the high-THC product.
That experience really opened my eyes and helped me understand how important it
is to experiment with different forms and types of cannabis even if you think
you are already being helped as much as possible. Remember, different strains
have different benefits. That’s why it is helpful to consult with doctors and
other experts who are knowledgeable about cannabis, try new strains and new
products, and experiment with dosage in order to get the most healing benefit
possible. 
Much more
recently, I have been able to obtain capsules that contain raw cannabis oil
that does not cause any psychoactivity for me, so I can take them any time of
the day or night without feeling groggy, wobbly, or at all high. This raw
cannabis oil is the best product yet for me for symptom relief. It is
considered “raw” because it is manufactured through a cold processing method –
which means that it is non-psychoactive, except in rare cases. That’s because
almost all of the THC that it would normally contain is present in a different
chemical form called tetrahydrocannabinolic acid
or THCa, a biosynthetic precursor to
THC. Note that the “a” at the end of
THCa stands for “acid.” When cannabis is exposed to heat, a process called
decarboxylation converts the THCa to THC. But, as long as it is raw, it
contains THCa, which has its own set of healing and symptom relief benefits,
different from those of THC, giving any raw cannabis product additional
advantages. Raw cannabis also contains a precursor form of CBD called CBDa,
which provides different benefits from those of CBD. (Please note that most raw
cannabis products DO contain small amounts
of THC and CBD, but they are often so small that they may not be quantifiable.)
Some months ago I
asked a greatly respected medical marijuana expert what he recommended for the
condition I have been diagnosed with. He suggested a 2:1 ratio of CBD to THC –
and my hunt ensued. While there are many medical cannabis products on the
market, at the time I wasn’t able to locate any that were a 2:1 CBD to THC. In that
situation, the only option is to try products that come closest. At the time, the
closest I found was a 3:1 product – but it didn’t provide symptom relief. In the world of medical marijuana, a lack of
success doesn’t necessarily mean the recommendation is wrong; it may mean that
you need to give the product more time and/or tweak your protocol. Or it’s
possible that it’s not the best product for you and it’s best to look for a
different one.
As you’ll learn in
more detail in later chapters, two different products that contain the exact same ratio of CBD and THC may give you very
different results. That’s because, in addition to the CBD and THC, there are
many other factors involved in any one product’s efficacy, including its
potency, the dosage taken, and the hundreds of other chemicals in the plant which
are present in smaller amounts – and in different ratios in each strain. 
I was delighted
when I obtained the raw cannabis oil capsules that I mentioned above, which is
a 3:1 CBDa to THCa product. This product gives me the most symptom relief
during the daytime of any products I have yet tried. Even though it’s not in
the 2:1 CBD to THC ratio that was recommended to me, it is the closest I have obtained
so far in a product that actually helps me.
I appreciate the benefits that I am getting from this raw oil product – no psychoactivity
and CBDa and THCa, which bring their
own unique benefits. Like many patients, I have also learned to “tweak” my
protocol by combining products. For example, a small amount of a high-THC
product along with the 3:1 CBDa to THCa product is closer to the recommended
2:1 CBD to THC ratio than either product on its own. That combination seems to
provide a bit more symptom relief and, I find that when I take a small amount
of THC along with high-CBD product, the
psychoactivity is lessened. 
I continue to take
a high-THC product at nighttime since, otherwise, muscle spasms and pain tend
to keep me awake most of the night.
  
Your Brain Produces Its Own Marijuana
I’ve written about
holistic health for over three decades and thought I knew a few things on the
subject. However, I was in for a surprise when I learned one of the main
reasons that scientists believe that cannabis is so healing: In the 1990s, researchers discovered that
there are natural chemical compounds in cannabis that match receptors in the
cells of our own bodies – referred to as “Your Brain’s Own Marijuana” in the
title of a Scientific American article. Many believe that it is this link
between the chemicals in the plant and those in the cells of our own bodies
that makes cannabis so unique, so good at quelling symptoms and, in some cases,
also bringing healing to health problems in the body and mind. In fact, the
cells in the body that are a match for the cannabinoids
in the cannabis plant were named endocannabinoids. ...A
healthy immune system supports the body’s individual cells as they repair themselves or replace themselves when
they are damaged. Receptors, which are structures located on the surface
of a cell or inside a cell – such as enzymes, neurotransmitters, or viruses –
are a vital part of this “repair or replace” process. They act like receivers
and give instructions to the cells to take a specific action, such as dividing,
dying and replacing themselves, or allowing a specific substance into the cell
or out of the cell. All of these actions occur constantly in the body as a
process of normal cell functions.
Different strains
of cannabis target different receptors in the body. Receptor sites on the
surface of cells can lock onto certain molecules when they come along,
basically working like locks and keys. Just like the front door of your home, a
receptor can only be unlocked by a key that fits into that specific type of
lock. In this “lock and key” system, a key that “matches” a lock then carries a
signal through the cell’s wall. Let’s look at the example of a receptor on the
surface of a cell that can act as a messenger for the sensation of pain. There
is a unique place on the surface of the cell where this receptor can dock. When
the pain receptor docks on the cell, it’s like a key that fits into the lock
and it then activates the pain signal. However, if the receptor is blocked, the
pain signal does not get through. Without the receptor, there’s no key to unlock
the door, so the sensation of pain does not occur because the “door” remains
locked. Many pharmaceutical drugs work by blocking specific receptors. For
example, when a person takes a pain-relieving drug, the drug stops the pain
receptor from activating and the person no longer feels the pain. ... 
Until recently,
cannabis was the only plant in which receptors that match our internal
endocannabinoids had been found, making this herb incredibly unique and special.
However, it didn’t make sense to me that there would be only one plant on this
vast planet that was a match for our human endocannabinoid receptors. So I
wasn’t surprised to find new research that indicates that chemicals from plants
other than cannabis also directly
interact with CB1 and/or CB2 receptors or have a chemical profile that is
similar to the cannabinoids in cannabis. While research on this subject is in
its infancy, the herb Echinacea has been found to be a match for some CB1 and
CB2 receptors, with other plants also being investigated for their roles in
promoting wellness via the human endocannabinoid system.  Meanwhile, some new
products combine cannabis and other healing botanicals such as Echinacea to
increase the effects and curative properties of both herbs. 
In Chapter 4 we
will look at the connection between these receptors in the cells and the
healing properties of cannabis that make it so powerful in healing bodily
conditions.

The Role of Cannabis in Promoting Homeostasis
There’s a lot
going on in your body simultaneously; it is set up for balance and harmony,
with a goal of promoting maximum wellness. The body’s constant effort to
maintain equilibrium among all of its internal processes and systems is called homeostasis, which the Merriam Webster Dictionary defines as “the
maintenance of relatively stable internal physiological conditions (as body
temperature or the pH of blood) in higher animals under fluctuating
environmental conditions.” Early on in my research I learned that
cannabis has some pretty awesome healing properties that promote this important
function in the body.
As the body pursues
optimal harmony and balance through homeostasis, it is constantly in the
process of compensating. When one process or system is out of balance, another
process or system compensates for the system that is not fully functioning. One
example is the body’s ability to regulate temperature. As the body gets too hot
or too cold, it will compensate to deal with the change in temperature. That’s
why you sweat on a hot day; it’s the body’s way of cooling down. 
The “repair and
replace” mechanism within all of the cells in your body is also part of
homeostasis. In fact, in the second that it took you to read this sentence,
thousands of your cells have been automatically repaired or replaced with new
cells. The body’s intelligence is mind-blowing and its ability to prioritize is
what homeostasis is all about.
Imbalances in any
of your body’s systems throw it off balance and out of whack and require
compensating systems to restore balance. For most of us, these compensating
mechanisms kick in automatically and keep us healthy, especially when we are
young. If we get a cold or flu, our immune system goes to work and we are soon
well again. If there is a toxin in the air, the body compensates, handles it,
and we don’t even know about it because the body is programmed for wellness. It
automatically compensates over and over to insure survival with the very best
outcome. That is, unless it is overwhelmed and unable to handle the challenges
that come its way, including infections, parasites, and environmental toxins.
And, in addition to the tangible challenges that we deal with in the physical
world, emotional traumas and negative thinking can also impact the body
chemistry in negative ways and impact our health.
So how does
homeostasis fit into the scheme of things when the subject is cannabis? Well,
anything that helps the body deal with its imbalances will help it get back
into homeostasis. While the ratios of the chemical compounds in cannabis vary
from strain to strain, scientists have discovered a wide range of positive
effects from these healing chemicals, including effects that are anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, anti-epileptic,
anti-ischemic, anti-diabetic, anti-psychotic, anti-nausea, anti-spasmodic,
antibiotic, anti-anxiety, anti-depressant, and anti-neoplastic (inhibiting
development of malignant cells).
Even knowing all
of this, it took a while for me to understand why cannabis is so significant
and powerful – and why its healing properties are utilized by our bodies to
such an amazing extent. Cannabis truly has a special and unique place in the
world of botanicals. I frequently refer to it as a sacred healing herb because
of the reverence I have for this gift from Nature. I will share lots more in
these chapters about why and you will
understand the reasons many doctors and other health professionals are now
recommending cannabis to patients.  
Most medicinal
herbs give us results over a period of time; their action is usually not very
fast and we might not feel the beneficial effects for days, weeks, or even
months. That is why it is important to give medicinal herbs time to do their
work and not give up on them too soon. It is okay that it takes time because we
understand that medicinal herbs heal on a causal basis. One of my mentors
recently used the term “softer” to describe the healing we receive from herbs
and many other holistic modalities. I liked that terminology because I believe
herbs heal on a deeper level than pharmaceuticals – and that does feel softer
to me. When we take a medicinal herb that benefits our body, it does so by
getting to the root of problems and restoring balance. 
Cannabis is
considered to be a superhero in the world of medicinal herbs because of the
positive side benefits that many patients experience. While it can take time
for a major health issue to be resolved, most patients feel some of the
beneficial effects of cannabis almost immediately, especially if they are
astute in noticing their body’s responses. For example, you might immediately
notice deeper, more relaxed breathing, and more relaxation in the muscles and
skeletal system, which can result in better sleep, fewer bathroom visits during
the night, improved lung function, and/or greater endurance and stamina.
Cannabis can also quickly boost a patient’s mental attitude and it is known for
giving quick relief to those suffering from nausea or lack of appetite. 

Contradictory and Confusing Perspectives from the
Powers That Be 
Like so many
others before me, once I had the official paper in my hand in which my state
government sanctioned my right to use an ancient healing herb – without too
much concern at that point in time of being arrested – I entered the maze. I
was a stranger in a strange land. I had many questions: Where do I get the
marijuana; what form of marijuana should I take (including smoking, vaporizing,
capsules, edibles, suppositories, creams, salves, and other forms); what strain
or type should I chose; what potency is right for me; and how often should I
take it? Unless we have a knowledgeable physician or other ally, these are
among the questions that we must all answer for ourselves. In most cases, we
are expected to figure out a lot of details in this new and somewhat strange
world and decide what is right for us as individuals. In fact, as of this
writing, doctors in some jurisdictions are not allowed to tell you anything
about it.
One has to be
discerning and at least somewhat knowledgeable in order to sift through the
mounds of dated, inaccurate, and biased information about cannabis that is
presented as truth in books and on the Internet. One of the reasons for this
glut of outdated, incorrect, and obviously skewed data was presented by Dr.
Gupta on his CNN special, Weed. He
reported that there have been over 20,000 studies on cannabis in the last
couple of decades; however almost all of them – 94 percent – were focused on
studying the deleterious effects and harm caused by marijuana, while only six
percent of the studies were focused on the benefits.  
The
biggest shock in the U.S. “war” against cannabis is that one branch of the
government says cannabis has no medicinal
value while, at the same time, a different branch of the U.S. federal
government patented the cannabinoid CBD for
its medicinal value. Clearly, there is a huge amount of evidence that
cannabis has great medicinal value for an untold number of illnesses and
conditions. But, as of this writing, the government still controls cannabis
research in the U.S. and has allowed an extremely limited amount to be done,
with most of it focused on disproving
the medicinal value of marijuana. As a result, most doctors still refuse to
recommend it due to the lack of “clinical trials.” It’s a Catch-22. The federal
government does not allow clinical trials and, at the same time, argues that
only clinical trials can establish proof of a medicinal value. As a result, to
date, very few medical cannabis patients have a professional healthcare
provider alongside them on their medical marijuana journey.
Anyone who knows
how scientific studies are set up understands that it can be challenging to set
up a totally unbiased study. If you want to study “deleterious effects and harm
from marijuana,” that is what you are looking for – and it is likely that you
will set up your research to focus on that. On the other hand, if you want to
study “benefits from marijuana,” you will set up a study to give you data that
proves the benefits of the herb. Unfortunately, for most of the last century,
the U.S. government rarely looked for anything good about marijuana. The
majority of the studies were done by the National Institute of Drug Abuse, a
branch of the government that was focused almost exclusively on funding studies
that would continue to demonize cannabis as a dangerous drug. Interestingly,
some of the very top medical doctors who now promote cannabis as an important
medicine were originally involved in research to debunk its medical benefits
and were converted to when their studies proved its great merits. Within these
chapters you will read about a couple of them. 
Most of us have
been brainwashed about the evils of “weed” all of our lives. Governments
branded it as dangerous and made it illegal. In the U.S., the Justice
Department put it on Schedule I of the Controlled
Substances Act, which means it has no
medicinal value and it is one of the most dangerous drugs available. The
irony is that while some government agencies continue to view cannabis as a
dangerous, illegal drug, other government agencies are well aware of its
medicinal value. While people were still being thrown into prison for
distributing or using marijuana for medicinal purposes, the government
continued to run its own medical marijuana program out of the University of
Mississippi. That program, which began in 1976, provides free cannabis each
month to the patients who are enrolled in it. All these years later, patients
who were originally part of this program are still receiving free cannabis from the United States government. 
In
addition to the government’s own contradictory marijuana giveaway program, the
craziness continued when the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
obtained a patent on cannabinoids for their antioxidant and neuroprotective
properties. Does this make sense – one government agency tells us that cannabis
is a dangerous and illegal Schedule I drug, with no medicinal value, while another
government agency not only acknowledges its medicinal value but also obtains a
patent for it? Now how is that possible, you might ask? Isn’t it impossible to
patent a plant? Apparently the U.S. federal government can do the impossible.
The abstract of
U.S. Patent 6630507, entitled “Cannabinoids as Antioxidants and
Neuroprotectants,” tells us exactly what the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services believes to be true about cannabis and its
chemical compounds, cannabinoids. It says, in part:  
""Cannabinoids
have been found to have antioxidant properties…. This new found property makes
cannabinoids useful in the treatment and prophylaxis of a wide variety of
oxidation associated diseases, such as ischemic, age-related, inflammatory and
autoimmune diseases. The cannabinoids are found to have particular application
as neuroprotectants, for example in limiting neurological damage following ischemic
insults, such as stroke and trauma, or in the treatment of neurodegenerative
diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and HIV dementia."" 
I am also
fascinated by the section in the patent entitled “Detailed Description of Some
Specific Embodiments,” which discusses more of what this “invention” – in this
case, “compounds” found in the herb cannabis – provide to the body:  
""This
invention provides antioxidant compounds and compositions, such as
pharmaceutical compositions, that include cannabinoids that act as free radical
scavengers for use in prophylaxis and treatment of disease. The invention also
includes methods for using the antioxidants in prevention and treatment of
pathological conditions such as ischemia (tissue hypoxia), and in subjects who
have been exposed to oxidant inducing agents such as cancer chemotherapy,
toxins, radiation, or other sources of oxidative stress. The compositions and
methods described herein are also used for preventing oxidative damage in
transplanted organs, for inhibiting reoxygenation injury following reperfusion
of ischemic tissues (for example in heart disease), and for any other condition
that is mediated by oxidative or free radical mechanisms of injury. In
particular embodiments of the invention, the compounds and compositions are
used in the treatment of ischemic cardiovascular and neurovascular conditions,
and neurodegenerative diseases. However the present invention can also be used
as an antioxidant treatment in non-neurological diseases.""
In addition to
this patent, a number of other patents have been granted by the U.S. government
for the medicinal value of cannabis, including:

U.S. Patent 20130059018: PhytoCannabinoids in the treatment of cancer
U.S. Patent 5,538,993:
Compounds according to the
present invention are characterized by various beneficial properties such as
analgesic, anti-emetic, sedative, anti-inflammatory, anti-glaucoma, and
neuroprotective activities
U.S. Patent 6,448,288: Use of
Cannabinoid compounds for inhibiting, inducing
U.S. Patent 4,876,276: Special use in cases of acute and of chronic pain
U.S. Patent 7,179,800: Useful for therapy, especially in the treatment of pain, inflammation
and autoimmune disease 



Clearly the U.S.
government knows that cannabis is actually a safe, effective, and inexpensive
medicine; not a dangerous drug with no medicinal value, as the Drug Enforcement
Administration has classified it for so long. 

A New Look at Old Stereotypes
Now let’s look at
a couple of the stereotypes about cannabis. The stereotype that cannabis causes
the “munchies” and leads to overeating may be true for some people when they
take some cannabis products. But –
again – it depends on the strain and the individual. Some people who are
overweight lose weight with no effort on medical cannabis – while those who are
underweight are often successful in gaining weight. 
I have been
overweight for most of my life. Even though I had dropped quite a bit of weight
a few years earlier using a nutritional supplement and doing emotional healing
work, at the point in time that I started taking cannabis, I was still
overweight and had been stuck on a plateau for a couple of years. For the first
six months or so that I took cannabis, I didn’t gain or lose weight. But then,
after I started taking a high-potency cannabis
oil product, which is now manufactured under the name Natur-Oil, I started
losing weight with no effort at all at the rate of one to three pounds a month
until I had lost about 30 pounds. I know that cannabis can help to balance the
blood sugar and I assume that is one of the many ways it has helped in my body.
Instead of getting the “munchies” and overeating, cannabis curbed my appetite
and my desire for sweets and carbs. I didn’t diet, eliminate or limit any
foods, or exercise more. I ate whatever I wanted and enjoyed every bite of
everything I chose to eat, including sweets and carbs, finding that my body
only wanted small amounts of them. That made weight loss easy. I was still
rather shocked on those occasions when I didn’t even want a small serving of a
yummy-looking dessert that was offered to me – but the fact that I didn’t WANT
it and passed on it for that reason felt really good. I have continued on this
trajectory – and I now feel that I’m “eating to live,” rather than “living to
eat.”  
Another stereotype
that’s prevalent among the public is that anyone who uses medical cannabis is a
slacker who “just wants to get stoned.” I’m okay with people getting stoned if
that is their choice, as long as they are responsible about it, but that is not
my desire. My experience is that getting high is NOT the preference of most
medical marijuana patients. Our goal is not to get high; our goal is to heal.
Thankfully, as I mentioned above, for those of us for whom the high is
undesirable, newer strains and forms of non-psychoactive cannabis are now
available.

</div>
<p><i>We want to
take an everyday product that is routinely bought and consumed in large
quantities, and leverage it to meet an important social need by
channelling 100% of the profits back to schools in the Australian communities.</i></p>
<p>Bottled
water is a $100 billion global business and it is expected to grow. In
Australia is worth approximately $400 million per year.</p>
<p>We will
bottle water with the brand name SCH<sub>2</sub>OOL, a combination of SCHOOL
and H<sub>2</sub>O. All the profits will go to benefit schools around
Australia.</p>
<p><i>SCH<sub>2</sub>OOL is
a not-for-profit brand of bottled water that gives back to the community by
helping schools raise money to fund education related projects. SCH<sub>2</sub>OOL
is an exciting new concept that harnesses kids' natural enthusiasm and channels
it to buy extra equipment for schools, nourishing Australia's future and
helping to grow strong communities that thrive.</i></p>
<p><i>There is
always more demand for equipment in Australian schools than educational budgets
can meet. Yet Australians annually spend millions of dollars on essential items
such as water, and that money is then lost to the community.</i></p>
<p><i>SCH<sub>2</sub>OOL brings together a need and an
opportunity, turning the purchase of bottled water into a mechanism through
which anyone can help raise money easily to directly benefit local schools.</i>
</p><p><i><span>SCH<sub>2</sub>OOL
water is special, because it does more than simply nourish healthy children; by
supporting their education it contributes to strong families and strong
communities.</span></i></p><p><i><span></span></i></p><h3>How It works</h3><p></p><p><i><span></span></i></p><p><i><i>SCH<sub>2</sub>OOL branded bottles are sold

school to receive the profit generated by its sale and the profits are awarded to each school in real time.</i></i></p><i>
</i><p></p>
<p><i>The
more bottles nominated to a particular school, the more money it receives.</i></p>
<p><i>
</i></p>
<p><i><i></i></i></p><h3>Every School Can Participate</h3><i>All a school has to do is register on the </i><i>SCH<sub>2</sub>OOL</i><i> website, and decide what
sort of equipment it wants to buy. iPads, a smart board, new sports
equipment…each school can use its money to buy whatever its pupils need. The
equipment selected is included in the school's public profile on the website,
providing a clear target for that school's children to aim for.</i><p></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>By fostering a collective spirit of pulling
together to reach the reward, </i><i>SCH<sub>2</sub>OOL</i><i> also teaches children the
important life lessons of cooperating to attain a common goal, and of setting
targets and working towards them.</i></p>
<i></i><p></p>
<h3>Marketing Strategy</h3><p></p><p>To be marketed successfully <i>SCH<sub>2</sub>OOL</i> needs to generate demand from the public and to build a network of outlets

momentum that requires little additional expenditure.</p>
<p><i>SCH<sub>2</sub>OOL</i> gains brand awareness by harnessing kids' boundless energy to spread
the word in their local communities, turning them into enthusiastic brand
advocates.</p>
<p><i>SCH<sub>2</sub>OOL</i> is therefore an attractive brand for retailers to stock, because local
kids who want their school to take part ask for it by name. Any retailer who fails
to offer <i>SCH<sub>2</sub>OOL</i> risks losing business to
those who do. </p>
<p>This effect is reinforced by the <i>SCH<sub>2</sub>OOL</i> website showing visitors which retailers stock <i>SCH<sub>2</sub>OOL</i> water in their local area. The website also actively encourages consumers
to support these local retailers. </p>
<p>By being associated with positive themes of
encouraging education and supporting schools and communities, <i>SCH<sub>2</sub>OOL</i> gains endorsement from schools and community leaders, further helping
its spread.</p>
<p>Add in that the money from <i>SCH<sub>2</sub>OOL</i> sales is helping local schools, and supporting <i>SCH<sub>2</sub>OOL</i> quickly becomes synonymous with supporting the local community. If

We want to

SCH2OOL
water is special, because it does more than simply nourish healthy children; by

SCH2OOL l has a
unique code, which allows the buyer to log in to the SCH2OOL website and nominate a
school to receive the profit generated by its sale and the profits are awarded to each school in real time.

The
more bottles nominated to a particular school, the more money it receives.


Every School Can ParticipateAll a school has to do is register on the SCH2OOL website, and decide what
sort of equipment it wants to buy. iPads, a smart board, new sports

for one of Hawaii’s first Medical Marijuana (MMJ) licenses.

I know I can make life easier for others with health challenges if I can get

Dry skin.  Be it seasonal, or a year-round allergy, those who suffer wouldn't wish it on anyone. Sure - there are options to help ease the suffering: pills, allergy shots, a steaming hot shower. One can also invest in an air purifier and/or a humidifier. These devices can help but can also be cumbersome to maintain and expensive to upgrade.</p><p>What if there was a better way; a smarter option?</p>Heaven Fresh is proud to introduce Smart WiFi air purifier and humidifier that operate as an integrated system, called 'Enviro-Pure System'. They can also work with other smart home devices and sensors to automatically improve the quality of your indoor air. <br/><p></p><p></p><p><b>Simplify and Automate Indoor Air Quality Management</b></p><p>Imagine, being notified on your TV to fill your water tank so your humidifier doesn’t stop working in the middle of the night. Or how about being able to turn off your smart home devices from work, so that you don’t waste energy, when no one is home? What about getting an auto reminder to clean and change the air purifier filters right on your smart phone? Imagine, being able to achieve fresh clean indoor air by talking to your home.

<p><strong>""</strong>I purchased this air cleaner about 4 months ago. I am a smoker and noticed the house was starting to smell this winter. I purchased this to also help with the dust and dog hair. After 1 week of having it running the house smells completely different. It is fresh (Heavenly fresh?) . The unit is very quiet and the auto feature is great. I also enjoy the timer. You can set it on full power (which is a little noisy like a fan) and leave the house. When I come home the air smells cleaner then the outside air.""</p>

<h3>For the Curious Minds - What's Under the Hood</h3>
<p>
</p>Below is a peak under the hood of our smart
connected products. We would love to have a one on one conversation about all
the technical “fun” we've had over the past two years bringing these smart
products to market. The smart home revolution is upon us and we'd like to
connect with all the brainiacs and tech gurus out there interested in working
with us to expand our IOT ecosystem.<br/><br/><p><strong>IoT Framework:</strong></p>
<p>We are using the open source IOT framework AllJoyn from Allseen Alliance to IOT enable our smart products. AllJoyn utilizes a client­ server architecture to communicate with devices and allows simplified interoperability between connected products and applications. Heaven Fresh products are AllJoyn Certified, meaning they comply with interoperability standards and should seamlessly interoperate with other certified AllJoyn products out of the box. Certification details can be seen on the AllJoyn certification page.</p>
<p>Heaven Fresh is a member of the Allseen Alliance. We are working closely with other member companies to continuously improve the open source framework. You can find out more about AllJoyn at <a href=""http://www.allseenalliance.com./"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.allseenalliance.com.</a> If you would like to know our reasons for choosing Alljoyn, you can read Imran's post on <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/smart-iot-air-purifier-humidifier-from-heaven-fresh-imran-bashir"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/smart-iot-air-purifier-humidifier-from-heaven-fresh-imran-bashir"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></p>
<p><strong>Hardware</strong></p>
<p>We chose two of our best selling products to IOT enable. Based on customer reviews, we know these products do fabulous jobs humidifying and purifying our customers homes. Rather then reinvent the wheel we improved them by adding an NXP K22F1M0 Cortex M4 ARM MCU and a GT202 802.11n wireless module.  Below are the specifications of the modules.</p>

<p>• Security Protocols: WPS, WPA, WPA2, WAPI, WEP, TKIP</p>
<p><strong>Firmware</strong></p>
<p>Our products utilize the AllJoyn thin client 15.09 running on NXP's MQX 4.1 RTOS. We have implemented the onboarding and configuration Alljoyn frameworks along with a custom control panel framework. For AWS IOT cloud services we are utilizing a Paho MQTT client along with WolfSSL SSL stack for enabling TLS 1.2 secured connection. Device firmware updates are done over the air (OTA) through MQX flash swap.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Apps</strong></p>
<p>All our mobile apps are native apps for their respective operating systems i.e. iOS, Android and Windows 10. These apps use the AllJoyn standard client and house the AllJoyn router. Our apps leverage the onboarding, configuration and a custom control panel AllJoyn framework. Our apps can discover other AllJoyn products connected to the same network allowing interoperability among other AllJoyn products. Our apps have two modes, local and cloud. Local mode allows our app to exchange AllJoyn messages directly to the device without the need of connecting to the cloud. Cloud mode is specifically used when away from your home network and relies on MQTT communication to AWS IOT cloud services to talk with your device.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud Service</strong></p>
<p>After reviewing countless cloud options, we chose to go with AWS IOT cloud. We will probably write a lengthy white paper on the cloud selection process but the key factors were:</p>
<p>1) Flexibility in options and services allowing us to build the service we want.</p>
<p>2) Designed for embedded and low power devices.</p>
<p>3) Technical support via cloud architects and developer forums.</p>
<p>4) Cost of the cloud services from a consumer product perspective.</p>
<p>AWS ticked all these boxes with their fantastic cloud services such as DynamoDB for databases, Lambda for compute services not to mention Kinesis, Identity Management, SES and EC2 all exposed to AWS IOT, bridging our smart products to the AWS cloud. AWS IOT ThingSDK provides simple wrappers for and MQTT client and TLS networking functions along with simple API for communicating with the AWS device shadow, all of this is wrapped into a small 16KB package.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>We take user and device security very seriously. Security is built into the AllJoyn framework that allows for point to point encryption using KEYX and PSK where AllJoyn applications hold keys to decrypt data. An enhancement to the existing security was also developed and is called Security 2.0. This allows an application to validate access to interfaces and objects based on policies installed by the owner. When our smart products or app connect to the AWS IOT cloud services they utilize TLSv1.2 with mutual authentication using ECDHE-­RSA-­AES128­-GCM­-SHA256 cipher suite. Device certificate generation is done within your local network meaning your devices private key is never transmitted over then internet.</p>
<p><strong>Interoperability</strong></p>
<p>Interoperability is the holy grail of the IoT (Internet of Things). Several industry groups as well as Apple and Google are trying to be the communication standard for the Internet connected devices. We have started with AllJoyn but we are also working in parallel to achieve interoperability with other devices/framework that do not speak AllJoyn (yet).</p>

Great Purchase

""This product has been a winner for me for sure. Bought it more then three years ago and it is still going strong. Easy to clean, easy to change filters. It really does make your whole house smell ""fresh"" I've never left a review on here before but I felt this air filter warranted ""
Ed37 - Ottawa, Ontario



Great product

""I purchased this air cleaner about 4 months ago. I am a smoker and noticed the house was starting to smell this winter. I purchased this to also help with the dust and dog hair. After 1 week of having it running the house smells completely different. It is fresh (Heavenly fresh?) . The unit is very quiet and the auto feature is great. I also enjoy the timer. You can set it on full power (which is a little noisy like a fan) and leave the house. When I come home the air smells cleaner then the outside air.""
IcedRide - Calgary, Alberta


Goodbye Dust!

""I purchased this due to dust and multiple animals in my house. I have had my purifier for a week now and have noticed that there is significantly less dust and hair floating around. I also like that the house smells fresh even after cooking. I am sure that with long term use I while continue to see even more changes in my home. Also for those concerned about noise it is very quiet on auto mode and when on high you don't even notice it.""
nancy5cats - Wembley, Alberta


Freshest Air Indoors

""This is truly an awesome product. The air in my house has never smelled so fresh! Highly recommended for people with seasonal allergies, dogs, etc. I have a Sharp Plasmacluster which never was able to get the air so clean and fresh. The unit is located upstairs on the landing outside our bedrooms and is able to clean and freshen up the air in my entire 2000 sf. house.""

Great Humidifier

""I just purchased this humidifier about 2 weeks ago. It has already outperformed, it has raised the humidity on our main floor from 27 to 40 %. It's a nice fine mist that doesn't leave a wet area around the humidifier, there is no white residue because it has a filter and I can place a few drops of essential oil on its special diffuser when I feel like it rather than contaminating the tank. In all I love this product and might purchase one for the upper level of my home as well.""

Awesome!

""I bought this machine for my son's bed room he loved it and I want one for my bed room too... So I ordered. This Humidifier has big water tank. Pretty quiet...""

For the Curious Minds - What's Under the Hood

Below is a peak under the hood of our smart
connected products. We would love to have a one on one conversation about all
the technical “fun” we've had over the past two years bringing these smart
products to market. The smart home revolution is upon us and we'd like to
connect with all the brainiacs and tech gurus out there interested in working
with us to expand our IOT ecosystem.IoT Framework:
We are using the open source IOT framework AllJoyn from Allseen Alliance to IOT enable our smart products. AllJoyn utilizes a client­ server architecture to communicate with devices and allows simplified interoperability between connected products and applications. Heaven Fresh products are AllJoyn Certified, meaning they comply with interoperability standards and should seamlessly interoperate with other certified AllJoyn products out of the box. Certification details can be seen on the AllJoyn certification page.
Heaven Fresh is a member of the Allseen Alliance. We are working closely with other member companies to continuously improve the open source framework. You can find out more about AllJoyn at http://www.allseenalliance.com. If you would like to know our reasons for choosing Alljoyn, you can read Imran's post on LinkedIn.

Hardware
We chose two of our best selling products to IOT enable. Based on customer reviews, we know these products do fabulous jobs humidifying and purifying our customers homes. Rather then reinvent the wheel we improved them by adding an NXP K22F1M0 Cortex M4 ARM MCU and a GT202 802.11n wireless module.  Below are the specifications of the modules.






NXP MK22FN1M0VLH12
• ARM Cortex­-M4 core
• Flash size/ SRAM: Flash 1MB/ SRAM 128KB
• Clock speed: 120MHz
GT202
• Network Processor: QCA4002
• Standard Supported: IEEE 802.11b/g/n
• Single band 2.4GHz
• Data Rates: 10Mbps
• Internet Protocols: IPV4/ IPV6, TCP/ UDP, ARP/NDP, DHCPv4, ICMPv6
• Security Protocols: WPS, WPA, WPA2, WAPI, WEP, TKIP
Firmware
Our products utilize the AllJoyn thin client 15.09 running on NXP's MQX 4.1 RTOS. We have implemented the onboarding and configuration Alljoyn frameworks along with a custom control panel framework. For AWS IOT cloud services we are utilizing a Paho MQTT client along with WolfSSL SSL stack for enabling TLS 1.2 secured connection. Device firmware updates are done over the air (OTA) through MQX flash swap.
Mobile Apps
All our mobile apps are native apps for their respective operating systems i.e. iOS, Android and Windows 10. These apps use the AllJoyn standard client and house the AllJoyn router. Our apps leverage the onboarding, configuration and a custom control panel AllJoyn framework. Our apps can discover other AllJoyn products connected to the same network allowing interoperability among other AllJoyn products. Our apps have two modes, local and cloud. Local mode allows our app to exchange AllJoyn messages directly to the device without the need of connecting to the cloud. Cloud mode is specifically used when away from your home network and relies on MQTT communication to AWS IOT cloud services to talk with your device.
Cloud Service
After reviewing countless cloud options, we chose to go with AWS IOT cloud. We will probably write a lengthy white paper on the cloud selection process but the key factors were:
1) Flexibility in options and services allowing us to build the service we want.
2) Designed for embedded and low power devices.
3) Technical support via cloud architects and developer forums.
4) Cost of the cloud services from a consumer product perspective.
AWS ticked all these boxes with their fantastic cloud services such as DynamoDB for databases, Lambda for compute services not to mention Kinesis, Identity Management, SES and EC2 all exposed to AWS IOT, bridging our smart products to the AWS cloud. AWS IOT ThingSDK provides simple wrappers for and MQTT client and TLS networking functions along with simple API for communicating with the AWS device shadow, all of this is wrapped into a small 16KB package.
Security
We take user and device security very seriously. Security is built into the AllJoyn framework that allows for point to point encryption using KEYX and PSK where AllJoyn applications hold keys to decrypt data. An enhancement to the existing security was also developed and is called Security 2.0. This allows an application to validate access to interfaces and objects based on policies installed by the owner. When our smart products or app connect to the AWS IOT cloud services they utilize TLSv1.2 with mutual authentication using ECDHE-­RSA-­AES128­-GCM­-SHA256 cipher suite. Device certificate generation is done within your local network meaning your devices private key is never transmitted over then internet.
Interoperability
Interoperability is the holy grail of the IoT (Internet of Things). Several industry groups as well as Apple and Google are trying to be the communication standard for the Internet connected devices. We have started with AllJoyn but we are also working in parallel to achieve interoperability with other devices/framework that do not speak AllJoyn (yet).

- Honeywell Lyric Thermostat (also joint marketing with Honeywell)
- Nest Thermostat
- Smasung SmartThings
- IFTTT
- Lowe's Iris
- Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) / IoTvity
- Apple HomeKit
- Google Weave / Brillo
We will be rolling out support for the above mentioned IoT hubs/frameworks periodically after the initial launch.Developer API
Heaven Fresh developer API will be released in 2017 for any developers and manufacturers who wish to connect to the Heaven Fresh products through the cloud but do not support one of the above mentioned framework. More details will be available on our website.

Medical Billing Concierge Service </b></p>
<p>For several years I have witnessed my mother and her friends
lament over their inability to understand their medical bills, health insurance
policies, and financial obligations to medical service providers. Shortly after
my mother’s hip surgery, we spent a great deal of time organizing each bill,
only to find that there were sometimes duplicates, and even triplicates of the
various statements. Upon this discovery, it was imperative to compare each bill
to her insurance policy, and sure enough we found discrepancies all over the
place! Luckily for us, I have a background in insurance, but I immediately
began to think; what about people that don’t? How many people have been
overcharged and not realized it? How many people have given up fighting with
the providers to get bills corrected? How many hundreds or thousands of dollars
should have been returned to patients because of incorrect billing? </p>
<p>That’s how I developed ErieView Consulting. I realized that
with this company I could assist not just seniors, but anyone who has neither
the time, knowledge, nor patience to wade through and fight incorrect billings.
I have assembled a team of some of the most competent and thorough
professionals I know, with experience in health care, health insurance, medical
billing, finance, accounting, and customer service. </p>
<p>We are ready to start working with  clients but we need your help ! Below are samples of the type of situations that we will see and help to resolve. These are not actual client stories but instead examples. <br/></p>

<p></p>If your child plays soccer in Central, Ohio, then you know there is a <b>BIG PROBLEM</b> when it comes to winter and spring.  That problem is a <b>frustrating lack of indoor athletic training space!</b>  With the growing popularity of the sport in Columbus, Ohio (along with the rest of the nation), much of the area is not prepared for the indoor training space required during the harsh snowy &amp; rainy months of the year.  Unless your club has an exclusive deal (which 90% of teams are not fortunate enough to have), your athlete is usually forced into one of three options each year:<p></p>
<p align=""left"">• <b>Run Down Indoor Space</b> - Many teams are forced to train at an out-of-date soccer indoor facility with run down turf, unsanitary conditions or worse; risking injury or hindered improvement.<br/></p>
<p align=""left"">• <b>School Gymnasiums</b> - If turf space is not available, many teams resort to train in small school gymnasiums with hard gym floors and inadequate space for development; risking further injury from hard falls.</p>
<p align=""left"">• <b>Inadequate Times</b> - If you do manage to secure training space at a soccer training facility, the majority of teams are given very inopportune times for student athletes (i.e. 8 pm for 10 years olds, etc.); sacrificing necessary education and sleep for soccer training availability.<br/></p>
<h3><b>We know how you feel and are determined to fix this problem.... with YOUR HELP!  Please help us to raise partial capital towards the development of a NEW soccer training facility in Columbus; one that will allow athletes and teams the opportunity to further develop their soccer future in a safe and educative environment! <br/></b></h3>

<p></p>
<p align=""left""><b>PLAN A</b> - <b>NEW Facility Construction</b> - The goal is to raise enough capital between contributors, investors and QTSD© capital loans to finance the construction of a new facility for soccer athletes in Columbus.  Initial quotes for this are approximately $750k for construction with additional costs of $60k for field turf and training equipment.  We are currently exploring options for land lease and purchase in the northeastern Columbus area.</p>
<p align=""left""><b>PLAN B - Existing Building Renovation</b> - The secondary plan is to explore existing buildings in the northern Columbus area that can be renovated for soccer training purposes.  The immediate challenge will be locating clear span designs; which will cost close to $20-$50k to rebuild structural designs to fit a soccer open field concept.  This building arrangement would be for 2-3 years, with the constant goal of moving forward with a NEW construction up to modern soccer standards for soccer individual and team development!</p>
<p align=""left"">Every dollar collected will be used to further the develop and acquisition of more consistent training space for soccer athletes and teams in Columbus; whether building or renovating new space!<br/></p>

<p align=""left"">1) <b>INDIEGOGO Campaign</b> -  We need <b>YOUR</b> support!  We are looking to raise approx.  $100,000 in campaign contributions towards offsetting the capital loans needed for the facility.  Why does that matter?  If we can offset the amount that we will need for our capital loans by $100,000, that will allow us to add even better options for your athlete and the soccer community.  If we meet our goal financially, we will be exploring the possibility of adding an outdoor field as well; turfed with lights so that teams and athletes will be able to compete and train outdoors as well.  <b>But that all hinges on your immediate support!</b></p>
<p align=""left"">2) <b>Individual Investors</b> - The second stage will be investor individuals, families and businesses.  We know that there are quite a few individuals and families that are not only passionate for their child's development but also support what we as a soccer training company stand for.  If you are interested in investing in our company's facility at a larger amount or length of time, contact us @ jpennell@qtsdsoccer.com and we will start discussing investment options at the end of March-early April 2016.</p>
<p align=""left"">3) <b>Capital Loans</b> - This is the final step; to apply for small business loans.  We are a small company and will be applying for loans to cover the remainder of the facility costs.  This amount will depend on how much is raised in the first two steps.  <br/></p>

So you feel full after eating only a small meal. <i>When you feel full your stomach tells your brain </i><i>your appetite </i><i>diminishes and hunger stops.</i></p><p> The <b>Pylo-Sphere</b> is designed to be placed and removed when your goal of weight loss is achieved.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><b>T</b><b>HE </b><b>C</b><b>ONSEQUENCES AND </b><b>C</b><b>OSTS OF </b><b>O</b><b>BESITY</b></p>

device that is inserted as an outpatient procedure and may be removed in minutes.
This technology promises to improve the health and quality of life for people with
clinically severe obesity.
AGT was founded in 2007 by Gary M. Annunziata D.O., a board certified gastroenterologist and inventor of this remarkable new weight-loss device.
Incorporated in Delaware, AGT is based in Southern California. The AGT team includes physicians, regulatory and reimbursement specialists, and thought leaders in the pharmaceutical and medical device research, development and marketing.
To date, AGT has successfully completed a significant portion of its pre-clinical trial studies and followed by a series of biocompatibility studies is prepared to begin a first-in-man pilot study to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the novel AGT weight loss device. AGT management plans to raise an initial round investment of $2M to file Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) with the FDA.THE MARKET OPPORTUNITY
Worldwide, obesity is a problem of epidemic proportions. In the United States alone, more than 78 million adults and 13 million children ages 2-19 — more than one-third of Americans (35.7%) are obese (BMI >30 kg/m2). By 2015, 75% of Americans will be overweight and 40% will be obese. Dr. Annunziata's Experience I have completed over 23,000 procedures involving the gastrointestinal tract.  I invented the Pylo-Sphere after observing that patients who developed a partial blockage of their stomach were losing weight with minimal symptoms! Designing the Pylo-Sphere required an extensive understanding of  the digestive process and the chemistry of weigh loss . I am uniquely positioned in that I have this understanding and the desire to create a solution. Over the last 8 years I have worked extensively with engineers and tested this device multiple times in animals. I have seen the results and they are quite amazing. The animals had rapid and consistent weight loss . This occurred without significant side effects or damage to the lining of the stomach.The Pylo-Sphere was designed based on a understanding of digestion. When you eat the stomach immediately enters a process known as the ""fed state"" during this part of digestion the stomach takes large particles of food and makes them small. The stomach does this by pushing the food back and fourth grinding it up trapping most of the large particles in the stomach. However during the fed state particles of food and fluid leak out into the small intestine,and is one of the reasons you can eat a meal larger than the size of your fist (the average size of the inner stomach). The Pylo-Sphere blocks this leakage of food particles during the fed state . So you feel full after eating only a small meal. When you feel full your stomach tells your brain your appetite diminishes and hunger stops. The Pylo-Sphere is designed to be placed and removed when your goal of weight loss is achieved.THE CONSEQUENCES AND COSTS OF OBESITY
Obesity significantly increases the risk for type 2 diabetes; hypercholesterolemia,hypertension, heart disease, and stroke; liver disease; gallbladder disease;gastrointestinal reflux disease; osteoarthritis, chronic joint pain, and back injury;sleep apnea and other respiratory ailments; and at least nine cancers.In the United States, obesity is the second-leading cause of preventable death after smoking. There is conclusive scientific evidence that mortality risk increases with increasing weight and that even slightly overweight adults — people of average height who are ten to 20 pounds above their ideal weight — are at increased risk of premature death. The rising prevalence of overweight and obesity not only foretells increasing adverse effects on health and longevity but also guarantees increased costs for medical care.
In the U.S., the direct cost of obesity adds approximately $150 billion to the annual health care tab, principally through its association with cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and some types of cancer. Obesity-related spending is projected to top $344 billion in 2018. Similarly, the indirect costs of decreased earnings, lost wages and productivity and the value of future earnings lost by premature mortality are staggering.  The global weight-loss market will top $516 billion by 2014.The U.S. weight-loss market is expected to reach $310 in 2014. The World Health Organization (WHO) predicts that 2.3 billion people around the world will be overweight and 700 million will be obese by 2015. TWhy is the Pylo-Sphere an incredible invention? The Pylo-Sphere is designed to be to easily in the stomach by a doctor in minutes . Because it's easy to place in the stomach the learning curve for doctors is fast and will greatly enhance the use of the Pylo-Sphere.  We plan to have the Pylo-Sphere on the market for doctors all over the world. The Pylo-Sphere will provide doctors with another solution for people who need to lose weight . Most people want a alternative to major surgery such as gastric bypass.Treating patients who have had serious complications from gastric bypass and lap band helped motivate me to design a better solution for weight loss that does not involve surgery. There is a huge demand for a simple solution . I believe the Pylo-Sphere is that solution. I have carefully analyzed other devices in development based on non surgical weight loss and know the Pylo-Sphere is cutting edge and superior technology.COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
Although clinical trials are currently underway to determine the safety and efficacy of more than 200 drugs intended to treat obesity, it has been 13 years since aweight-loss drug has received FDA approval and only two, Qsymia is a combination of phentermine, a sympathomimetic amine anorectic, and topiramate extended-release,an anti epileptic drug and Belviq, an anorexiant, received FDA approval in 2012. Nonetheless, there are promising compounds with the potential to treat obesity on the horizon. For example, Scripps Research Institute investigators have synthesized small molecules that act by altering the biological clock and based on animal studies these may prove effective for a range of chronic conditions including obesity. Several medical device companies have attempted to design weight-loss devices intended to obstruct the gastrointestinal tract, deliver electronic neural stimulation or mechanically stimulate neuronal receptors in the duodenum to enhance satiety (EnteroMedics’ vagus nerve blocking therapy) Gastric pacemakers from both EnteroMedics and Transneuronix were largely unsuccessful in 2009 clinical trials. The Transneuronix failure occurred shortly after Medtronic acquired the company for  $269 million.Another device, which produces malabsorption (GI Dynamic’s EndoBarrier), is marketed in select regions in Europe and South America but is not approved for sale in the United States.
In 2012, Obalon Therapeutics Inc. secured $1.5 million to conduct an observational pilot study of gastrointestinal space-occupying device to promote weight loss. Although none have received FDA approval, at least one (Endosphere) secured $3.1 million in a Series B round and received its CE mark in Europe in 2012. ReShapeDuoTM, a non-surgical, dual-intragastric balloon filled with saline, met its primary efficacy endpoints in a U.S., randomized, sham-controlled trial for weight loss and ReShape Medical, Inc. plans to submit a Premarket Approval application to the FDA in the second quarter of 2014.The AGT weight loss device offers significant advantages compared to electrical
implants, gastric stimulators and others devices:
● The AGT weight loss device does not use a battery; battery-operated devices
require periodic procedures to change batteries
● Because it does not require a battery, the ADT weight-loss device is likely to
perform more reliably with less risk of malfunction
● Since insertion of the AGT weight loss device does not require an incision, the
risk of infection is minimal
● Devices approved in Europe are years from entering the United States market;
by contrast, AGT has a clear path to U.S. FDA approvalCrowdfunding Support :YOUR donation will help make the difference .

<div>Imagine taking your child to the hospital knowing she has appendicitis. When you arrive, you are told that the hospital does not have an ultrasound machine to diagnose her, and there is not a surgeon to take care of her. You would be one of the 5 billion people worldwide without access to basic surgical care. At Tenwek Hospital in western Kenya, we are training surgeons who will serve in resource-limited areas. To better educate and prepare them, and to improve care of patients, we hope to buy a portable ultrasound machine.<br/>

</h3>
</div><div> <p>The cost of a portable ultrasound machine is roughly $20,000. All the funds raised will go toward the purchase of a portable ultrasound machine for the surgical residency program. We are grateful to those who will match our fundraising to meet our goal.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Imagine taking your child to the hospital knowing she has appendicitis. When you arrive, you are told that the hospital does not have an ultrasound machine to diagnose her, and there is not a surgeon to take care of her. You would be one of the 5 billion people worldwide without access to basic surgical care. At Tenwek Hospital in western Kenya, we are training surgeons who will serve in resource-limited areas. To better educate and prepare them, and to improve care of patients, we hope to buy a portable ultrasound machine.



What We Need

 The cost of a portable ultrasound machine is roughly $20,000. All the funds raised will go toward the purchase of a portable ultrasound machine for the surgical residency program. We are grateful to those who will match our fundraising to meet our goal.
The Impact
 Tenwek is successfully training surgical residents. Our graduates continue to work for hospitals in resource-limited areas. Similar projects have greatly helped advance the care Tenwek Hospital can offer. By funding this project and investing in the future leaders of Kenya, you will also be helping to bring better surgical care throughout the continent.
Risks & Challenges 

To properly train residents, we need certain resources. Without them, we will get by, but not nearly as well as we could.

This is a debilitating and life-threatening condition which affects around 25% of people with diabetes at some point during their lifetime. It results in over 9,000 lower-limb amputations in the UK and 73,000 in the USA, and these numbers continue to rise. It’s a largely preventable condition if the correct treatment is given, such as pressure reducing insoles. Yet custom insoles that can lower foot pressure points require individually designing which means they take a long time to make. They’re bulky and usually require specialist footwear which makes them difficult to wear. They use multiple layers of foam which compresses with use which need replacing frequently, and they’re also very expensive. </p><p>The magnitude of this problem let the NHS to run a competition, via its SBRI Healthcare programme, inviting companies to come up with new ways to tackle this awful condition that affects so many people.</p><p>This inspired us to see whether new 3D scanning and 3D printing technology might lead to a solution. We teamed up with experts in manufacturing and biomechanics and developed a concept using a new flexible material to create a personalised yet low-cost insole. Our competition application was successful and we set out to turn this promising idea into a product. </p><p>Over the next 3 years insoles, 3D scanners and 3D printers were designed, algorithms developed, concepts tested and patents filed. The resulting insole was slim enough to fit into everyday footwear yet, when optimised to each individual's foot shape and load profile, reduced high pressure areas on the foot associated with ulcer formation. Clinical testing showed this was twice as effective as with the semi-bespoke insoles provided by podiatrists.

The Problem


Many people think that breastfeeding is easy, but actually, it is a skill that requires a lot of practice and support. There are 4 million births each year in the US, and 82% of these babies are not breastfed for the recommended 6 months. (From CDC Breastfeeding Report Card (2011)) 

We know that breastfeeding can be extremely beneficial for both baby & mom.

Unfortunately, mothers can run into dozens of barriers like low milk supply, problems with latch due to nipple shape, breast pain, and breast engorgement. The public health infrastructure in the United States is just not set up to support breastfeeding.

Why does this matter?

Breast massage can improve, prevent, or alleviate the most common breastfeeding problems, it can even double the amount of milk you can pump in a session! We want to make it as easy as possible for parents and providers to learn about when and how to use breast massage!

<p>My
name is Michael. I have bartended for over 20 years in New York City
and San Francisco. I make great cocktails, but unless you are in
San Francisco there is no chance for you to enjoy them.</p>
<p>My
solution: I put them in a bottle and sell them across the country. </p>
<p>Most bottled cocktails are low flavor, low
quality, <span style=""background-color: initial;"">low calorie.</span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> It’s high time that everyone had access to handcrafted,
inventive cocktails made by an expert.</span></p>
<p>The
craft cocktail movement strives to treat the art of the drink with
the same care for taste, quality and presentation that a chef brings
to meals. I've been working with professional chefs for decades to
improve my own tasting palate, and I've learned the nuances of
complex ingredients. I've received many honors for my dedication to
the art of the cocktail. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">My work has been featured by taste-makers in a variety of media.</span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> I have presented my cocktails on </span><a href=""http://www.today.com/food/3-sexy-sophisticated-valentines-day-cocktails-1D80357644"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Today Show</a><a href=""http://www.today.com/food/3-sexy-sophisticated-valentines-day-cocktails-1D80357644"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"" target=""_blank""></a><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">,

<p>With
your help I can set up a licensed manufacturing space, and my
dream of bottling great cocktails can be your reality of drinking great bottled cocktails in the convenience of your living room.</p>
<p>My company's premiere concoctions will infuse classic cocktails with
hand-made ingredients:</p>
<h2><i>Harvest Manhattan</i></h2>
<p>This
is a cocktail that begins with roasted pumpkins, pureed and strained
with a host of locally-sourced spices to make our own pumpkin
liqueur. The final drink adds <span style=""background-color: initial;"">notes of cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and clove </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">to the classic Manhattan.</span></p>
<h2><i>The
Dark Knight</i></h2>
<p>A
thoughtfully-balanced update to the classic Negroni cocktail, the
Dark Knight features my own homemade vermouth, perfectly balanced
with Campari, Aperol, and gin. The sour of vinegar and pink peppercorn is tempered by the sweetness of brown sugar and bing cherries. 
</p>
<h2><i>Chamomile Old Fashioned</i></h2>
<p>In
a 72-hour process, I infuse bourbon with loose-leaf chamomile tea.
This is carefully combined with an assortment of bitters and
locally-sourced honey. <br/></p>
<h3>Authenticity, Not Artificiality</h3>
<p>By focusing on craftsmanship and flavor, I can offer tasty cocktails 
with dramatically more flavor than the current market offering. To be clear, MCM cocktails will contain:</p>
<h4>All natural ingredients</h4>
<h4>No artificial colors or flavors</h4>
<h4>No preservatives</h4>
<h4>No MSG or corn syrup</h4>

Through
endless tinkering and rigorous testing, I've perfected the complexity
and character of these drinks, and now I want to you to be able to
enjoy them, in the comfort of your home. 
<ul> </ul>
<h3>What MCM Needs...and What You Get</h3>
<h2>
</h2>
</div><div> <p>I need $50,000 to bottle my first bulk batch of The Dark Knight, Chamomile Old Fashioned, and Harvest Manhattan.</p>
<p>I will need:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Manufacturing space and all necessary licensing</li>
<li>This space will be built out as both a commercial kitchen and a bottling line</li>
<li>First orders for bottles, labels, spirits, and ingredients</li>
</ul>
<div>Then I will have the materials I need to <span style=""background-color: initial;"">get these cocktails on the shelves at</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> liquor, grocery, and convenience stores.</span>
</div>
<div>For helping me out, I have great perks available:</div>
<div>Naturally, vouchers will be available for the actual bottled cocktails, priced $50-$200. </div>
<div>But I am most excited about creating a personalized cocktail for you at the $25 contribution, as well as an original recipe included at the $100/$200 level. These recipes are a direct way for me to empower craft cocktail creation and enjoyment at the grassroots level.</div>
<div>I have been teaching for over a decade. At the $500 &amp; $1000 levels you will get a class, taught by me and featuring some of my favorite cocktails, and a chance to ask a seasoned professional anything you'd like.</div>
<div>There is a reason my Instagram is themobilemixologist—I love to travel. At the $2000 level I will fly to you, and teach you a class in the location of your choosing. <br/>
</div> </div> <div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<h2> </h2>
<p>MCM is a chance to spread the gospel of a well-made drink to everyone, everywhere, on their own terms. The bottled cocktail market is currently filled with processed, pale imitations of good drinks. MCM looks to fight back with creativity and integrity so that a delightful cocktail is available to everyone.<br/></p>
<p>Bartending and teaching mixology is a time-honored interaction from bartender/teacher to guest/student. I look to extend this tradition by spreading my message throughout the land. I will work tirelessly to spread the good word of a great drink through tastings, classes, videos... however I can reach people. And when I leave, my cocktails shall remain.</p>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
</div>

</div></div>","My
name is Michael. I have bartended for over 20 years in New York City
and San Francisco. I make great cocktails, but unless you are in
San Francisco there is no chance for you to enjoy them.
My
solution: I put them in a bottle and sell them across the country. 
Most bottled cocktails are low flavor, low
quality, low calorie. It’s high time that everyone had access to handcrafted,
inventive cocktails made by an expert.
The
craft cocktail movement strives to treat the art of the drink with
the same care for taste, quality and presentation that a chef brings
to meals. I've been working with professional chefs for decades to
improve my own tasting palate, and I've learned the nuances of
complex ingredients. I've received many honors for my dedication to
the art of the cocktail. My work has been featured by taste-makers in a variety of media. I have presented my cocktails on The Today Show,
and I've been chosen by the San Francisco Chronicle as an “SF Bar Star.” I have taught thousands of people how to make
better drinks, and
how
to drink better. I
want to bottle that experience and send it out into the world.

With
your help I can set up a licensed manufacturing space, and my
dream of bottling great cocktails can be your reality of drinking great bottled cocktails in the convenience of your living room.
My company's premiere concoctions will infuse classic cocktails with
hand-made ingredients:
Harvest Manhattan
This
is a cocktail that begins with roasted pumpkins, pureed and strained
with a host of locally-sourced spices to make our own pumpkin
liqueur. The final drink adds notes of cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and clove to the classic Manhattan.
The
Dark Knight
A
thoughtfully-balanced update to the classic Negroni cocktail, the
Dark Knight features my own homemade vermouth, perfectly balanced
with Campari, Aperol, and gin. The sour of vinegar and pink peppercorn is tempered by the sweetness of brown sugar and bing cherries. 

Chamomile Old Fashioned
In
a 72-hour process, I infuse bourbon with loose-leaf chamomile tea.
This is carefully combined with an assortment of bitters and
locally-sourced honey. 
Authenticity, Not Artificiality
By focusing on craftsmanship and flavor, I can offer tasty cocktails 
with dramatically more flavor than the current market offering. To be clear, MCM cocktails will contain:
All natural ingredients
No artificial colors or flavors
No preservatives
No MSG or corn syrup

Through
endless tinkering and rigorous testing, I've perfected the complexity
and character of these drinks, and now I want to you to be able to
enjoy them, in the comfort of your home. 
 
What MCM Needs...and What You Get


 I need $50,000 to bottle my first bulk batch of The Dark Knight, Chamomile Old Fashioned, and Harvest Manhattan.
I will need:


Manufacturing space and all necessary licensing
This space will be built out as both a commercial kitchen and a bottling line
First orders for bottles, labels, spirits, and ingredients

Then I will have the materials I need to get these cocktails on the shelves at liquor, grocery, and convenience stores.

For helping me out, I have great perks available:
Naturally, vouchers will be available for the actual bottled cocktails, priced $50-$200. 
But I am most excited about creating a personalized cocktail for you at the $25 contribution, as well as an original recipe included at the $100/$200 level. These recipes are a direct way for me to empower craft cocktail creation and enjoyment at the grassroots level.
I have been teaching for over a decade. At the $500 & $1000 levels you will get a class, taught by me and featuring some of my favorite cocktails, and a chance to ask a seasoned professional anything you'd like.
There is a reason my Instagram is themobilemixologist—I love to travel. At the $2000 level I will fly to you, and teach you a class in the location of your choosing. 
  
The Impact
 
MCM is a chance to spread the gospel of a well-made drink to everyone, everywhere, on their own terms. The bottled cocktail market is currently filled with processed, pale imitations of good drinks. MCM looks to fight back with creativity and integrity so that a delightful cocktail is available to everyone.
Bartending and teaching mixology is a time-honored interaction from bartender/teacher to guest/student. I look to extend this tradition by spreading my message throughout the land. I will work tirelessly to spread the good word of a great drink through tastings, classes, videos... however I can reach people. And when I leave, my cocktails shall remain.

I have been setting routes at VCU’s Climbing wall for 3 years, and I met my wife climbing at VCU 3 years ago. As many of you, I made the progression from top-roping to sport climbing, and finally to traditional climbing. Luckily I had the benefit of having two great local climbing gyms to train at as I learned. (Peak Experiences, and VCU Climbing Wall) And while I made the transition from top-roping to sport fairly quickly, progressing to trad became difficult as there were few people qualified to teach it, and even fewer with their own gear, who were proficient at it. The disparity perplexed me, as did the danger of learning on my own or with inexperienced others.</p><p>With this problem in mind I begin work on creating a solution. Today I’m proud to tell you the I-TCD (Indoor-Traditional Climbing Device) is that solution. The I-TCD makes it possible to practice and lead on traditional gear in indoor gyms, whereby increasing the safety of the sport while creating an opportunity for experienced traditional climbers to teach others how to become more confident and proficient at the sport.

Additionally I’ve gotten a lot of great feedback from climbers from all over the US, and Internationally. To put the costs in perspective; paying for the patent itself is going to cost just over $15,000. Prototypes for UIAA testing and rating will run another $8000, plus the cost of having the devices tested and rated. (note the I-TCD will exceed the current climbing gear standards coming in with a 32kN normal load capability, and a 18kN axial load capability.

Keep in mind that the I-TCD will also reduce the strain on outdoor crags in State and National Parks, and on US Forest Service lands. By training climbers to use Trad Gear in the safety of indoor environments; a skill that will transfer to the outdoors, we will together reduce the need for bolted routes outdoors and therefore our impact on the environment, while increasing the number of areas climbers are permitted to climb in.</p><p>With your help getting the patent under way, our next step is to manufacture 3 devices for UIAA testing, and for testing here at Native Heights Climbing Solutions.

The impact is to improve both the patients and the care providers lives by:Providing a sense of autonomy for patients that need help standing and walking, usually provided by another person.Helping to relieve the care provider of physical back strains from lifting and achieving time management gains by allowing the user to perform more functions on their own.The Rise Active Chair can also help with bariatric care to stimulate exercise and those recovering from temporary conditions like knee or back problems.We could likely all benefit from the lift and assist features at one time or another through the full course of life.Risks & ChallengesWe believe the idea and the function of the Rise Active Chair will be life changing for many people in their quest to maintain an active and independent life.  The main business risks are:The incremental cost will be too high for large scale adoption of the feature.Insurance subsidies may not be available in the first models which would limit access to lower income users.Our goal is to work with manufacturers on breakthrough designs to reduce the cost of robotic lift mechanisms in this application.   This will be critical to achieve the lift feature at a cost increment that will appeal to a large segment of wheelchair users.   Other Ways You Can HelpWe believe that the more people who know about the effort, the better our chances of being successful will be, and the more people will benefit with mobility sooner.  So..Please tell people about this concept and have them contact us with their needs and ideas. Share this idea on Facebook and help spread the word!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

It's been reported that there has been a rapid increase in the cases being diagnosed in the UK, Ireland, Holland, Australia, Canada and many other places globally - so we feel with our test we could facilitate an earlier diagnosis, save the health service millions and more importantly save and improve the quality of patient's lives.</p>
<p>So, if you and your family are exposed to a tick bite, essentially you could test your urine and our test would illustrate if the lyme is present - we think we might call it LymeTect and our plan if we can raise the funds is to have these tests available in every pharmacy, supermarket, hospital and GP surgery.  If the test shows as positive, antibiotic therapy would help to inhibit the disease before it becomes chronic Lyme and damage is done.</p>

</div><div><h3>The Impact</h3></div><div><p>At this time, there aren’t sufficient Obstacle Course Races (OCR) that are available to people with a variety of ailments or disabilities; our races are designed to include everyone. OCR's aren't just about sport, they are about camaraderie, fitness and aspiration. There are individuals who were born with amazing odds against them, physically and/or mentally and have persevered.  There are also others who have endured a trauma causing a physical disability and now have to re-learn life from a different perspective.  We feel giving these individuals an Obstacle Course Race will prove to be a new athletic endeavor. This creates an opportunity for the disabled community to showcase strength, empower, to motivate others and also improve their own social dynamic.</p></div><div>
<h3>Safety</h3>
<div>Our main concern is first and foremost safety.It is paramount that the participants and their families feel safe and comfortable while also having a good time. We have taken every precaution to ensure safety . Our construction crews are experienced and certified, and will provide approval of  final obstacles built. Along with safety, we have an extensive background in physical fitness backing us up and organizations that are well established in the disabled community on board to guide us.</div>

The ImpactAt this time, there aren’t sufficient Obstacle Course Races (OCR) that are available to people with a variety of ailments or disabilities; our races are designed to include everyone. OCR's aren't just about sport, they are about camaraderie, fitness and aspiration. There are individuals who were born with amazing odds against them, physically and/or mentally and have persevered.  There are also others who have endured a trauma causing a physical disability and now have to re-learn life from a different perspective.  We feel giving these individuals an Obstacle Course Race will prove to be a new athletic endeavor. This creates an opportunity for the disabled community to showcase strength, empower, to motivate others and also improve their own social dynamic.
Safety
Our main concern is first and foremost safety.It is paramount that the participants and their families feel safe and comfortable while also having a good time. We have taken every precaution to ensure safety . Our construction crews are experienced and certified, and will provide approval of  final obstacles built. Along with safety, we have an extensive background in physical fitness backing us up and organizations that are well established in the disabled community on board to guide us.


ROR with us!
If you can’t help with a donation, please SHARE us with your family and friends. Help us spread the word and become a national name in the OCR community. Grab our hand and start uplifting individuals by sharing our vision and encouraging individuals to become RENEGADES. Welcome to The ROR!

* At this time race date and location is TBD in the Tri-state Area! Keep up to date on our website.",5.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Hello! I am Michael Yao, and a junior at Dougherty Valley
High School. I have a strong interest in the biological sciences, and plan to
major in Molecular Biology or Biochemistry in college. I have been working on
research projects in the late Dr. Gruenert’s group at the University of
California San Francisco (UCSF) since June 2015, and I plan to work on a new
project starting this summer with Dr. Shingo Suzuki at UCSF: a bioengineered
cure to various neuronal diseases, including Alzheimer’s Disease,
schizophrenia, Huntington’s Disease, and depression. </p>
<p>Very recently, molecular biology has advanced greatly in the
span of a few short decades, as the array of techniques and tools available to
researchers has expanded just as drastically. It is now possible to generate
stem cells and “induce pluripotency” <i>from
somatic cells</i>, as well as guide their differentiation into other somatic
cell types.  In order to achieve the goal
of working towards a cure for a wide variety of neuronal diseases, my project
involves the editing of specific human genes that are critical to cellular
differentiation into neuronal somatic cells, genes such as cdk5, BDNF, ANK3,
and Abi2. The gene modification would involve the seamless introduction of
foreign DNA into the genome that would cause the co-expression of a certain
fluorescence protein and/or resistance to certain drugs that would normally
kill unmodified cells. This gene modification has no foreseeable adverse
effects on the human genome, and would provide an easy way for researchers to
screen cells based on fluorescence protein expression levels or resistance to
drug treatment and facilitate the differentiation process of iPSCs into
neuronal cells, cells that express the cdk5, BDNF, ANK3, and Abi2 genes at
significant levels.</p>
<p>In essence, <b>my
project will help researchers develop new therapies and drug treatments for
neuronal diseases by making cells glow if they are functionally corrected. </b></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p></p>
<p>In order to conduct this months-long experiment, I am
working towards a goal of raising $3,000 to help cover the costs of scientific
research. The money raised will go directly to my lab at UCSF in order to cover
laboratory expenses, the use of the laboratory facility, DNA sequencing
expenses, constructing DNA sequences, and maintaining cell cultures.</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>Although the science behind this experiment may be
complicated, the reasons for it are simple and easy to understand: this project
will provide researchers an easy and efficient means of controlling the
differentiation of cells into neuronal cells, <b>facilitating the study of neuronal diseases and ultimately leading to
possible cures for the wide array of the diseases that affect <i>one in four</i> American adults in any given
year</b>, according to the US National Institute of Mental Health. Clearly, the
success of this experiment could greatly advance the biological understanding
of how the brain works at the cellular level.</p>
<p>I have been working with similar projects and biological
experiments for the past year under the guidance of experienced researchers,
post-docs, and professionals in the field. Grateful for the help that I receive
from them to this very day, I am confident that my developing lab skills and
interest in my work will contribute to the success of this project. In

<h2><strong>Nada Bottle</strong></h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485643353/bci2n0tozgdqdikgtd8y.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>An Original Design</strong></p>
<p>Nada Bottle is a lightweight, packable, &amp; durable hydration answer for the modern day explorer.</p>
<p>Nada Bottle is an original water bottle solution, born in Crested Butte, Colorado. This innovative bottle has been engineered with a CORDURA® nylon outer shell, a BPA-free plastic lining, and a braided paracord carrying strap connected to the cap. Nada Bottle's innovative, collapsible design makes this tough, customizable bottle the only bottle you will ever need. The cap opening is large enough for ice, but small enough to avoid that pesky wet t-shirt look. The braided paracord, connecting the cap to the stainless-steel grommet, can easily be unattached and unraveled creating a short rope. Military grade paracord has a variety of life-saving uses when adventuring. </p>
<p>By ordering a Nada Bottle today you’re helping us get our feet on the ground. We need to get our inventory moving and expand our brand! Our minimum goal of $20,000 will fund future water donations, marketing, and additional color &amp; size options. We would really love your help getting our name out there. With your support we can help a highly durable, reusable water bottle reach its potential and continue sending clean water to communities in need! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485643975/adnlv5uo97xspotw24sl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>The truth about BPA</strong></p>
<p>Most hydration product lines claim to be BPA-free. What they've neglected to inform consumers is that what they've substituted for BPA, most likely BPS, can be just as dangerous.</p>
<p>Plastic alternatives, primarily silicone and metal, have some equally negative side-effects. While silicone has proven to be a steady contender, the complaints I've found on the foul taste it gives your water were enough for me to steer clear. The majority of the research I've found on metal water bottles indicated that various chemicals inevitably leech into you water over-time, making this alternative just as dangerous as plastic. Additionally, I've never seen a metal bottle, stainless steel or otherwise, collapse into your pocket. The only bottle that can truly be free of BPA, BPS, BPF, etc. is a BPA-free glass, but then we're faced with the problem of catering to a more active clientele; a broken glass bottle can be a hassle at best, and dangerous at worst. Bottom line: glass breaks.</p>
<p>After years of diligent research, we found that a BPA-free plastic bottle with a protective shield may very well be the best alternative. Due to Nada Bottle's military grade CORDURA® nylon exterior, your Nada Bottle can be left in the sun, washed in the dishwasher, thrown down a mountain and still be chemical free!      </p>

<h3><strong>Our mission to Locate Life</strong></h3>
<p>After experiencing first-hand the lack of clean water, Nada Bottle made it a priority to provide water filters to those in need. For every Nada Bottle sold, one person in an impoverished community will be provided with safe drinking water. This will be accomplished by allocating a portion of the funds from Nada Bottle sales to the construction of wells and distribution of Sawyer Water Filters around the world.

<h3><strong>Let's talk about waste...</strong></h3>
<p>-Making bottles to meet America’s demand for bottled water uses more than 17 million barrels of oil annually, enough to fuel 1.3 million cars for a year. </p>
<p>-The energy we waste using bottled water would be enough to power 190,000 homes. </p>
<p>-Last year, the average American used 167 disposable water bottles, but only recycled 38.</p>
<p>-Americans used about 50 billion plastic water bottles last year. However, the U.S.’s recycling rate for plastic is only 23 percent, which means 38 billion water bottles – more than $1 billion worth of plastic – are wasted each year. </p>
<p>-The recommended eight glasses of water a day, at U.S. tap rates equals about $.49 per year; that same amount of bottled water is about $1,400. </p>
<p>-Antimony, which is found in PET plastic bottles, in small doses can cause dizziness and depression; in larger doses it can cause nausea, vomiting and death.</p>

<h3><strong>Story</strong></h3>
<p>The concept of Nada Bottle came about when a biking enthusiast, an eco-minded backpacker, and a motivated realist came together in the heart of the Rocky Mountains. The first prototype was engineered in an old Crested Butte kitchen using a nylon sheet, super glue, and an iron. The desire for a collapsible water bottle, or a container that was ""not a bottle"", was devised after many trips abroad allowing for just one backpack and numerous trips into the wilderness with just enough space for a small water bottle and a filter. After going through numerous unreliable plastic water bottles, Nada Bottle became a reality.</p>

<h3><strong>About The Owner</strong></h3>
<p>Taryn Jacob is an entrepreneur with a cause. She and friends started their business, Nada Bottle, to raise money to bring clean water to people in need. She’s doing that by giving travelers and outdoorspeople an innovative collapsible container to carry water on their ventures.</p>
<p>Taryn, now 27, has itched to travel since she was a Kansas youngster with a huge map of Africa on her wall. So she used her jobs to see the world: via plane as a flight attendant, and by train as a backstage technician for the Ringling Brothers circus. She learned to travel on her own “on the smallest budget possible,” sometimes backpacking internationally for three months at a time. Almost everywhere, she found clean water was an issue. “One of the leading causes of death in the world is bad water,” she said.</p>
<p>Years later in Crested Butte, after her dog had chewed up a fourth Platypus water bottle, she and her boyfriend, engineer Andrew McKee, started imagining the next generation of collapsible water containers. Andrew began working on designs and materials. After some kitchen experiments with nylon sheets and an iron, they came up with a tough (dog-resistant), lightweight prototype. Andrew honed in on a military-grade Cordura nylon exterior and a lid attached by a “survival strap” — a paracord (used in parachuting) that can be unraveled to a long, multi-purpose cord. The nylon cover protects the BPA-free plastic liner from damage by the sun. The nylon also works well for screen-printing designs, team mascots and logos.</p>
<p>Focused on the global need for clean water, Taryn insisted that Nada Bottle be “more of a social mission.” The company committed that for each water bottle sold, it would donate a water filter to a disadvantaged community.</p>
<p>With a product and a mission, the friends tackled fundraising, outreach and preliminary manufacturing research. Via Kickstarter they raised $30,000 and got orders for 1500 water bottles. But the next hurdle loomed huge.</p>
<p>“We were so naïve about the manufacturing,” Taryn said. The type of nylon they wanted wasn’t being made or sewn in the U.S., so they resorted to a Chinese manufacturer. Next they discovered the minimum order for the product they wanted was a whopping 16,000 bottles, which required renewed fundraising and additional debt. Then came communication issues, hassles and delays.</p>

<p>Even with frustrations and delays in getting a marketable product, Taryn has ambitions for Nada Bottle. Within a few years she hopes the business will be large and solid enough to diversify its containers, offering various designs, sizes and features like water filter attachments. “We’re still in the seed stage, but we’re about to take off,” she said.</p>
<p>It’s been a long path from studying the map of Africa on her wall as a child to knowing she’s helping some people there drink safe, healthy water.</p>
<p>“To keep going, I have to remember why I’m doing this: for clean water,” Taryn said. “To accomplish that, I have to have a good product and a successful business.”</p>

<h3><strong>Seasonal Use</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Summer</strong></p>
<p>Use Nada Bottle when mountain biking, hiking or climbing. The abrasion resistant nylon material won’t puncture or crack like other plastic water bottles on the market today, and Nada Bottle's grommet is the perfect size for most carabineers to easily latch through.</p>

<p><strong>Winter</strong></p>
<p>Skiing? Ice climbing? Maybe just going out for a winter walk? Nada Bottle's smooth, nylon material makes it easy and comfortable to slide under your coat or down jacket. Your body temperature will keep your bottle from freezing when experiencing cold conditions. When the bottle is empty, simply roll it up and keep it close for later.</p>

An Original Design
Nada Bottle is a lightweight, packable, & durable hydration answer for the modern day explorer.
Nada Bottle is an original water bottle solution, born in Crested Butte, Colorado. This innovative bottle has been engineered with a CORDURA® nylon outer shell, a BPA-free plastic lining, and a braided paracord carrying strap connected to the cap. Nada Bottle's innovative, collapsible design makes this tough, customizable bottle the only bottle you will ever need. The cap opening is large enough for ice, but small enough to avoid that pesky wet t-shirt look. The braided paracord, connecting the cap to the stainless-steel grommet, can easily be unattached and unraveled creating a short rope. Military grade paracord has a variety of life-saving uses when adventuring. 
By ordering a Nada Bottle today you’re helping us get our feet on the ground. We need to get our inventory moving and expand our brand! Our minimum goal of $20,000 will fund future water donations, marketing, and additional color & size options. We would really love your help getting our name out there. With your support we can help a highly durable, reusable water bottle reach its potential and continue sending clean water to communities in need! 

The truth about BPA
Most hydration product lines claim to be BPA-free. What they've neglected to inform consumers is that what they've substituted for BPA, most likely BPS, can be just as dangerous.
Plastic alternatives, primarily silicone and metal, have some equally negative side-effects. While silicone has proven to be a steady contender, the complaints I've found on the foul taste it gives your water were enough for me to steer clear. The majority of the research I've found on metal water bottles indicated that various chemicals inevitably leech into you water over-time, making this alternative just as dangerous as plastic. Additionally, I've never seen a metal bottle, stainless steel or otherwise, collapse into your pocket. The only bottle that can truly be free of BPA, BPS, BPF, etc. is a BPA-free glass, but then we're faced with the problem of catering to a more active clientele; a broken glass bottle can be a hassle at best, and dangerous at worst. Bottom line: glass breaks.
After years of diligent research, we found that a BPA-free plastic bottle with a protective shield may very well be the best alternative. Due to Nada Bottle's military grade CORDURA® nylon exterior, your Nada Bottle can be left in the sun, washed in the dishwasher, thrown down a mountain and still be chemical free!      

Our mission to Locate Life
After experiencing first-hand the lack of clean water, Nada Bottle made it a priority to provide water filters to those in need. For every Nada Bottle sold, one person in an impoverished community will be provided with safe drinking water. This will be accomplished by allocating a portion of the funds from Nada Bottle sales to the construction of wells and distribution of Sawyer Water Filters around the world. Every Nada Bottle customer will receive an authentic link between the product they purchased and the location of the safe water they donated. Once you receive you water bottle, simply type the coordinates located on the packaging into our Locate Life page at https://www.nadabottle.com/locate-life/ see where your clean water donation went!

Ova ideja okuplja stručnjake iz područja psihijatrije, psihologije, socijalnog i pedagoškog rada s višegodišnjim iskustvom u radu s djecom i mladima koji imaju različite poremećaje i poteškoće iz područja mentalnog zdravlja, a temelji se na kontinuiranom tretmanskom, psihoterapijskom i savjetodavnom radu. PSIHOREHABILITACIJSKI CENTAR OSIJEK stručnom podrškom do sada je obuhvatio 427 korisnika u svojim programima i aktivnostima. To je bio jedan od pokazatelja potrebe za polikliničkim ustrojem.Kontekst PROBLEMA i RAZLOZI za osnivanje ustanoveZbog evidentnog porasta broja prijavljene zlostavljane ili zanemarene djece u slavonskoj regiji, djece s poremećajima ponašanja i različitim psihičkim poteškoćama, koja često odrastaju u disfunkcionalnim obiteljima, prolaze brakorazvod roditelja i druge krizne situacije,  iznimno smo motivirani osigurati stručnu timsku uslugu na najvišoj razini. Slavonska regija, kao područje koje je bilo zahvaćeno ratom se i danas suočava s brojnim poslijeratnim teškoćama i posljedicama, a dodatno je opterećena  i teškom  gospodarskom situacijom u Hrvatskoj, što je rezultiralo egzistencijalnim krahom mnogih obitelji, čestom disfunkcionalnom obiteljskom okruženju i zabrinjavajuće velikom broju brakorazvoda. Ovakvo stanje snažno se reflektiralo na mentalno zdravlje i odrastanje djece i mladih u Slavoniji. Istodobno nedostaju stručne institucije koje objedinjuju različite pristupe i stručne poslove usmjerene zaštiti djece. Jasno je da kao udruga sve teže možemo pokriti stručnu skrb sve većeg broja korisnika.

Deformational plagiocephaly, also known as positional plagiocephaly, means a mis-shapen or uneven (asymmetrical) head shape. Plagiocephaly does not affect the development of a baby's brain, but if not treated it may change their physical appearance by causing uneven growth of their face and head. Jaw and ear alignment could be affected, leaving them unable to wear glasses or a bicycle helmet later in life. 80% of skull growth takes place in the first year of life and slows after the first 12 to 18 months. The skull fuses at around 18 to 24 months.</p><p> </p><h3>Signs and symptoms  </h3><p>It is common for a newborn baby to have an unusually shaped head. This can be caused by the position of the baby in the uterus during pregnancy, or can happen during birth. Your baby's head should go back to a normal shape within about six weeks after birth. Sometimes a baby's head does not return to a normal shape and the baby may have developed a flattened spot at the back or side of the head. This condition is known as deformational plagiocephaly.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482433963/sahwyvlcepdwycknbage.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>Causes  </h3><p>The bones of a newborn baby's head are thin and flexible so the head is soft and may change shape easily. Flattening of the head in one area may happen if a baby lies with its head in the same position for a long time.</p><p> </p><p><i><strong>The increased incidence of plagiocephaly is largely due to the “Back to Sleep” campaign, designed to reduce the incidence of “cot death”. Since 1994, many paediatric associations have been recommending back sleeping positioning as a means of avoiding Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).</strong></i></p><p> </p><h2>Treatments</h2><p>The most common forms of treatment are repositioning and helmet therapy.</p><p>Repositioning, also known as counter positioning, means changing or alternating the position of your baby’s head to allow an even weight distribution. This involves parents making sure their infant does not rest on the flat spot by alternating their baby's head position from the back to the sides. Increased tummy time and lying your baby on their side to play can also help. Repositioning is often effective during the first three to four months.</p><p>Sometimes when the uneven head shape is more severe or where counter positioning did not work, a cranial remodelling helmet (corrective helmets) may help. Helmets are lightweight and made of a thin hard shell with a foam lining for comfort. The helmet helps the skull re-shaping process by removing the pressure over the flat area and allowing the skull to grow into the space provided. Helmets work best between four and eight months of age.</p><p>The helmet must be worn for 23 hours a day and may come off for one hour (i.e. to wash your baby's hair). The helmet shape must be adjusted by the orthotist every one to two weeks and treatment usually takes between five to nine months. The helmet therapy costs around $4000.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482434936/otctcrvtsxefr6gzpfcz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><h2>Deliveries and Timelines </h2><p>Business Requirements and Functional Design Specification: Jan 2017 - Completed</p><p>App Functional Development for Android and ios: Feb 2017 - Ongoing</p><p>Image Filtering and Processing Functionalities: Mar 2017</p><p>Alpha Tests - Functionality and Sample data: April 2017</p><p>Release of SME Version of Baby Headsup for acquiring  infants' data as well as extra cranial measurements and processing them using Deep Learning methods: May 2017</p><p>Beta Tests - Real data validation and acquiring real patients data: May to December 2017</p><p>Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning Techniques: June to December 2017</p><p>Creating Awareness among local pediatrician, kids physiotherapists and children hospitals: Nov - Dec 2017</p><p>Official End User Version Release: Jan 2018</p><p>Adding other languages and more contacts: Feb 2018</p><p> </p><h2>Perks: </h2><p>No kids yet or no plans to have kids, no problem.

Increased tummy time and lying your baby on their side to play can also help. Repositioning is often effective during the first three to four months.Sometimes when the uneven head shape is more severe or where counter positioning did not work, a cranial remodelling helmet (corrective helmets) may help. Helmets are lightweight and made of a thin hard shell with a foam lining for comfort. The helmet helps the skull re-shaping process by removing the pressure over the flat area and allowing the skull to grow into the space provided. Helmets work best between four and eight months of age.The helmet must be worn for 23 hours a day and may come off for one hour (i.e. to wash your baby's hair). The helmet shape must be adjusted by the orthotist every one to two weeks and treatment usually takes between five to nine months. The helmet therapy costs around $4000. Deliveries and Timelines Business Requirements and Functional Design Specification: Jan 2017 - CompletedApp Functional Development for Android and ios: Feb 2017 - OngoingImage Filtering and Processing Functionalities: Mar 2017Alpha Tests - Functionality and Sample data: April 2017Release of SME Version of Baby Headsup for acquiring  infants' data as well as extra cranial measurements and processing them using Deep Learning methods: May 2017Beta Tests - Real data validation and acquiring real patients data: May to December 2017Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning Techniques: June to December 2017Creating Awareness among local pediatrician, kids physiotherapists and children hospitals: Nov - Dec 2017Official End User Version Release: Jan 2018Adding other languages and more contacts: Feb 2018 Perks: No kids yet or no plans to have kids, no problem. We would still love to have your support and will send you a signed thank you from our team together with some Austrian specialty as indicated on the Perks Plan.  The gift packs filled with genuine Salzburg Mozart balls and Mozart tales will delight your loved ones on every occasion. Every time you enjoy one of these, remember you also helped to control infants' head deformity.Mirabell is one of the most traditional brands in Austria. The genuine Salzburger Mozartkugeln of Mirabell are still produced according to the origin and tradition in Mozart's homeland Salzburg (Grödig) - 14 work steps and a total of 2 ½ hours of production time are needed for each of these small works of art.  The production time per Salzburg Mozarttaler covers 11 work steps and lasts about 1.5 hours.Get the rare plant on your window sill. Just open the can and add water.Unusual gift from the Alps - Edelweiss in a can. The Edelweiss is one of the most famous and symbolic alpine flowers. Edelweiss is also in the logo of the Austrian Alpine Association and other alpine associations. The Edelweiss was also used for love charms and as a symbol for demonstration of love and bold daring. Occasionally, abnormally large flowering stars (6 to 12 centimeters in diameter) are found, which appear in the legendary world as ""enchanting kings"". In Austria the Edelweiß was already as of 1886 under nature protection.Let yourself be seduced by the most famous Austrian confectionery specialty! Only the genuine tastes like this!   Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)Q1: How much this app would eventually cost?The Baby Headsup app remains always free for all the parents all the world.Q2: Would the app work on my Android Mobile?Yes, the app would become available for Blackberry, Android, iPad, iPhone and Windows Phones.Q3: When will the app become available?The official End-User Version is planned to be released January 2018, though all the backers will be given access to the SME (Subject Matter Expert) Version of Baby Headsup around May 2017. This comes with added functionalities for acquiring infants' data as well as extra craniometer measurements and processing them using Deep Learning methods.Q4: Will my baby’s photos be transferred to a server for further processing?No, the photos are users' private property and would not be transferred outside the smartphone. All the measurements to determine any type of deformity is done locally on your mobile device.Q5: How would I know if I am taking the photos right?The photos would follow the frames as displayed on the screen with a separate frame for each of the 6 photos from different angels. The images with shaken hand, unclear borders or the images with uneven borders like outstanding hairs would not be accepted or saved. If a photo does not meet the guidelines the user is asked to repeat it. Risks and challengesIn order to validate the correct functionality of the app and raise the precision of the simulated measurements with regards to normal thresholds, extensive verification needs by done by using real data, involving around 1000 deformed and 1000 good cases examined using the craniometer measurement, an international medical standard of measurement used to determine the severity of flat head.Finding these number of parents who would be willing to take part in this study and come every 2 weeks in the early months after the child's' birth for screening using the app together with craniometer measurement might be a challenge.We have the support of several pediatricians and children physiotherapists who would participate to promote this valuable study and innovative preventative solution which should be reachable over 8 months allowing extensive data validation for calibrating and training the app. ~~~°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°~~~Thousands of infants with head deformities have to go through expensive and lengthy therapies which is avoidable if noticed early on. We truly believe in early intervention in children with orthotic needs and we are passionate about building awareness among parents as well as pediatricians and providing them with an easy app solution to watch for deformities.Every child deserves not having misshapen head.  We want to see this benefit your family and families around the world.  Please support our campaign and our mission.

<p><u><strong>Who are we?</strong></u></p>
<p>Powerhouse Juice is small batch, cold pressed juice company. It is owned and operated by husband and wife duo Heather and Robert DeBerio.    We have sold our juice in over 18 farmers markets around Massachusetts. Our Juice has been featured in Boston Globe Magazine as having ""The Best Green Juice."" </p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>Why Cold Pressed Juice?</strong></u></p>
<p>Cold pressed juice is the most beneficial juicing option available in today's market.  Raw juices have natural enzymes, vitamins and minerals that you cant get from whole or cooked fruits and vegetables.  Most people don't maintain a balanced diet, juicing is a great option as an alternative way to get your daily fruit and vegetable requirements.  Our juices pack a full 4-6lbs of fruits and vegetables in each bottle.  The amazing health benefits of juicing has been around for centuries, the ancient Greeks were juicing pomegranates for the many nutritional benefits it provides them.</p>
<p><u><strong>Why Should you Give?</strong></u></p>
<p>Pledges to this campaign will help us bring our small family business to the next level.  We work hard to make fresh pressed juice every morning and we want to be able to expand and utilize our time and efforts in the most productive ways possible.  Growing our production space, making more juices daily, offering juice in a wider variety of towns and venues will help us reach more consumers</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise $12,000  to help cover plumbing costs, pathogen and shelf life studies, Indiegogo fees, labels, packaging, and permitting at wholesale level.</p>
<p><strong><u>Plumbing $5,000-</u></strong> We moved into our new space in September and have yet to get the plumbing done due to unexpected costs.  The plumbing is estimated to cost $7,000, this includes running piping, digging up the concrete floors, pulling permits, and labor costs.   We have all the fixtures, such as: a three bay sink, walk in refrigeration and work tables, all ready to be installed.  Without the proper plumbing we will not be able to get the kitchen inspected by the health department. </p>
<p><strong><u>Pathogen and shelf life testing $3,500</u></strong>- We need to get our 4 main juices and 1 nut milk juice tested for pathogens, and bacteria which will determine the shelf life and expiration date of each juice.  These tests cost an average of $600-$800 each juice.</p>
<p><strong><u>Indeigogo Fees $1,000</u></strong>- Indiegogo fees as well as credit card processing fees.</p>
<p><strong><u>Labels and Packaging 1,500-</u> </strong> We only have 1 label that is used for all of our juices.  We will need to have a different label with ingredients and nutritional facts for each individual juice we produce.</p>
<p><strong><u>Permittting and Becoming an LLC $1000</u></strong>- Right now Powerhouse Juice is a sole proprietor.  We want to protect ourselves and our business, becoming an LLC is the best way for us to do that.  We will also need Permits for wholesale.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Several months ago we contacted some of the most important companies that produce clothing and sports equipment. Since then, after they analyzed our project and received all the consent, we had to face o deal with the opposite problem: which brand choose.</p>
<p>The challenge for us has already begun: improving and optimized the project.</p>
<p>It was necessary to take a web designer and three web developers to sspeed up the software development.</p>
<p>We believe that problems can be found in every work, especially during users' trial time. In our case it could be software configuration, but the important thing isto identification, understand the comprehension and, at the end, achievement to solve it properly and immediately, with the minor inconvenience possible.</p>
<p>Ours is a new project under development; so far an ""app"" with these characteristics was never submitted. Once it's completed, the important thing is how to make it known to the world, so we are taking into consideration some form of advertising: we don't exclude to involve the previously selected companies as sponsors.</p>
<p>We have already received offers to purchase the shares from investors, but we want to achieve the objectives with ours capacity. We firmly believe in our abilities.</p>
<p>Reguarding similar product: for years some ""app"" dedicated to fitness were used very successfully and they are a great support to those who practice sports because with them you can calculate calories, distance, duration and speed. Several million users around the world use these applications, even without getting anything. With our ""app"" you may benefit from the economic advantage.</p>
<p>The idea has been deposited to the SIAE therefore copyrighted.</p>

</div></div>","RUNHEART is an application similar to the famous application Runtastic.
The peculiarity that distinguishes RUNHEART is converting data (speed, times of activity, miles, etc.) in money which allow to buy sports products or make donations.
The software that determine BONUS is an algorithm studied specifically for this purpose.
Your sports activities produce scores and in agreement with sponsors, it will be assigned coupons for the purchase of products.
In cooperation with some sponsors and foundations, the money obtained, instead of being used for the purchase of products, can also be donated to charity.

Risks & Challenges
Several months ago we contacted some of the most important companies that produce clothing and sports equipment. Since then, after they analyzed our project and received all the consent, we had to face o deal with the opposite problem: which brand choose.
The challenge for us has already begun: improving and optimized the project.
It was necessary to take a web designer and three web developers to sspeed up the software development.
We believe that problems can be found in every work, especially during users' trial time. In our case it could be software configuration, but the important thing isto identification, understand the comprehension and, at the end, achievement to solve it properly and immediately, with the minor inconvenience possible.
Ours is a new project under development; so far an ""app"" with these characteristics was never submitted. Once it's completed, the important thing is how to make it known to the world, so we are taking into consideration some form of advertising: we don't exclude to involve the previously selected companies as sponsors.
We have already received offers to purchase the shares from investors, but we want to achieve the objectives with ours capacity. We firmly believe in our abilities.
Reguarding similar product: for years some ""app"" dedicated to fitness were used very successfully and they are a great support to those who practice sports because with them you can calculate calories, distance, duration and speed. Several million users around the world use these applications, even without getting anything. With our ""app"" you may benefit from the economic advantage.
The idea has been deposited to the SIAE therefore copyrighted.

We need about $70,000   in order to break The G-Rider onto the market. That will include any  product improvements from our backers feedback, product marketing, initialising distribution systems, materials, labour and related expenses for a full production run. This we hope to see happen by May 2017.Risks and ChallengesA great deal of time has been taken to get everything in place before launching this campaign. To lessen the risk to our backers and reduce our performance anxiety!We have personally invested as much as we can in order to get this campaign to a point where we believe it is ready, willing and capable, to provide a product to backers within TWO MONTHS.We have supported 2000 products to a final stage, these will come in an exclusive transparent pink, possibly limited to this campaign only. We have taken the risk to fund the project to this point; as we believe that the support of our backers,who love the G-Rider as much as we do, will assist us in impacting the market place. We have a great team in place  to overcome any  obstacles at our final stage,  but there is always the unknown. Our team will face every obstacle with the same tenacity and perseverance that we have from the start.We respect everyone's privacy and therefore want to make sure that we are supporting your peace of mind.If you wish to remain anonymous but still want to support our campaign PLEASE make sure that you tick the box that indicates you wish to be ANONYMOUS and only your contribution amount will be shown on the campaign page.The packaging we use for the G-Rider will be completely discreet.

<p>Mission</p>
<p>What we are building is a medical records management system embedded with your DNA. Our system creates an unbreakable bond between your records and you as the registered owner of them. You can think of this as digital key and lock. Both the key and the lock are combined into the same device. When you attempt to open the lock it will check your DNA to confirm your identity.</p>
<p>We are building an ecosystem for medical professionals and providers. The idea is your medical professional will suggest you need a scan or xRAY etc. You attend the clinic and they perform the scans, the scans are uploaded to their secure servers and encrypted by your DNA key. Only you can access the scan, you attend your doctor surgery and unlock the report for your doctor or the specialist they then refer to you. All the time, you control who has access and only you have access to your medical reports.</p>
<p>iZAC plan to establish the business over the next 12  months. The project aims are to :</p>
<p>1. Develop an iPhone application to access the records</p>
<p>2. Create the DNA encryption key</p>
<p>3. Build the ecosystem or medical professionals and providers</p>
<p>By investing is our early stage funding we offer to have you join us as investors usually reserved for “Angel investors” or the capital markets. We are offering all contributors to this crowdfunding stage access to the reserved investors pool.</p>
<p>As an additional benefit you will also be invited to the developers forum, where you will be in a position to influence the development team and be rewarded for your efforts.</p>
<p>In summary:</p>
<p>1.      Discounted 400:1 Token price</p>
<p>2.      Initial investor status +15% Token Share</p>
<p>3.      Optional access to the Dev team forum +10% Token Share</p>

<h3>The App</h3>
<p>This is what it's all about, this is going to make your exercise and training life much easier. Allow me to give you a quick summary of the app, what the basic version will do and what's in store for future versions.</p>
<p>The first and most basic version can be calibrated to count reps, for example, <strong>clean and jerk</strong>, <strong>snatch</strong>, <strong>swing</strong>, <strong>clean and press</strong>, and it will do that for the kettlebell (V1) and barbell (V2). This on its own is already the most important app you've been waiting for.</p>
<p>The future releases will focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>counting actual workouts that have different types of exercises</li>
<li>reporting missed lifts and allow adding them to the count</li>
<li>display RPM</li>

ENHANCED FILTRATION - A design that conditions the air that you breathe2. COMFORT - The highest level of comfort possible.3. CONVENIENCE - Increasing functionality to make it a truly useful tool and platform.  FOR YOUR FILTRATION 2x washable particulate filters and 2x N95 filters (one duo for AIR in, and one duo for AIR out) purify the airflow in each direction. FOR YOUR COMFORT Silicone rubber facepiece is comfortably soft, non-stick and hypo-allergenic. Bespoke facepiece, coming soon, conforms precisely to your face for optimal seal and fit.Lightweight materials, and off-loading the power cell, allow us to provide the lightest possible full-function mask.A fully-adjustable, ergonomically-designed neoprene strap.Fan-assisted airflow for easy natural breathing. FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE Easy to operate, no complicated set-up.Runs for more than 8 full hours of constant use.Seal to face avoids fogging of eyeglasses.The front and rear covers, face-piece and straps are all washable with dish soap and water. The electronics chassis can be cleaned in a sanitization box. THIS IS A FULLY CUSTOMIZABLE MASK Shortly after our initial production run, we will begin to offer various additional features, accessories and benefits:1. Color choices for front-piece, mask frame, and/or head-straps.2. Dedications, logos, branding, designs on mask or straps, or laser-etched into the facepiece.3. Full range of Mask Cozy's.AND ... unique to Firstwave3D PersonalAIR™ :A personalized facepiece molded to your facial contoursLater this year, we will post our EZscan iPhone app at the App Store, which will leverage available 3D-facial-scan technology. As a PersonalAIR™ START owner, you will be able to scan your face; the app will enable us to send you a facepiece that is customized precisely to your face. Each PersonalAIR™ START unit purchased during this Indiegogo campaign will qualify for a custom-fit facepiece.  MAKE IT YOUR STYLE We are introducing our first design initially available in 2 colors. (Indiegogo perks will be the White on Grey.) Once production and delivery launch in May, we plan to add many more colors, textures, cozy's, and finishes.The strap clips are chrome-plated aluminum-alloy to provide strength and style.  COMPARISON CHART OF MASK TYPES  YOUR PersonalAIR™ START MASK PACKAGE INCLUDES: PersonalAIR™ START MaskUniversal Silicone FacepieceMask CozyAdjustable StrapUSB Cable AssemblyUSB-C Battery BankPlus - Indiegogo bonus - Coupon for Free Custom-fit Facepiece   The PersonalAIR™ mask includes a battery-bank and mask Cozy.WHAT'S INSIDE?All the electronics live on an internal removable chassis which simply lifts out for easy access and cleaning. An Atmel microcontroller is at the heart of the PersonalAIR™ START mask.2x particulate filters, 2x N95 filters (one set for AIR in, and one set for AIR out). 2x low-noise speed-adjustable fans assist the airflow.


 


 
 


 
COMPONENTS

We include an Atmel microcontroller in the mask to control various functions. Fan speed is controlled by the processor.  We constantly monitor the internal temperature in software and also in hardware for additional safety.  By including 2x kill switches for added safety, if the fans stop working for any reason, or the internal temperature rises, the system will automatically shut off.Our Design eliminates the battery as a component within the mask, and places it in your pocket, or snugly worn in a lanyard. This allows us to keep the mask weight as light as possible while providing a high-capacity 10,000mAh  battery-bank, capable of running all the processes and functions for 8+ hours at full power.  The battery connects via a magnetic USB-C connector for safe quick-connect and disconnect.CONNECTING POWER TO THE MASK VIA USB-COUR MASK CAN BE WORN FOR PROFESSIONAL OR PERSONAL USEIf you need to be around others for extended periods of time, the PersonalAIR™ offers conditioning and filtration, understated style, and convenience. INDIEGOGO SPECIALS  If you are interested in purchasing more than 50 units please reach out to us for further details.https://www.firstwave3d.com/formOUR DESIGN EVOLUTION The following image shows how we evolved the design over 6 months and how it looks today as a production-ready mask. DEVELOPMENTWe thought you would enjoy being a part of our development journey. Here are some images of our prototypes, and how we had to change various items along the way. We also learned a lot about breathing, filtration, ultraviolet light, plastics, materials, and much more in order to bring you this seemingly simple product. An average person can breathe up to 6 Liters of air per minute while at rest. That's a lot of air. We breathe in and out. When we breathe out, it's warm and humid...as you continue to breathe, that heat just builds up and makes your mask warmer and soggier... our design included solutions to these engineering challenges.THE FRONT PANELThis is replaceable in various colors (after we begin production) and provides access to the filter compartments.THE REAR VIEW The only part of the mask that touches your face is the central facepiece. It will be made of FDA-approved silicone rubber, which conforms against your face for a comfortable fit.   WHY HAVE WE EMBARKED ON THIS JOURNEY?This is a story that started over 35 years ago when two work colleagues soon after becoming friends, left their McDonnell Douglas roots to pursue very different careers, only to meet again recently. A simple catch-up phone call immediately ignited a creative spark that has sent us both on a new adventure. We are now bringing a unique vision to reality. By applying our decades of experience to solve the current obstacles we’ve observed in the present mask-wearing climate. The more time we have spent on this project, the more we have truly enjoyed the experience culminating in this Indiegogo campaign.  So, we have arrived at the point that we need your help to accelerate our ability to produce this advanced mask solution. THE TEAMWe have established our team over time and space. Knowing each other for over 35 years and working across 8 time zones. That takes a lot of coordination and attention to detail to deliver this unique product.https://www.firstwave3d.com/about/",31.0,3,"1 Campaign

<p>            As experts and new research indicated above, that Cardio &amp; Dieting, will not tighten your waist, burn calories 24 hour per day, burn belly fat, stop body aging and it only requires minutes with total CORE STRENGTHENING. There has been no Core/Ab machine until now that will tighten all Core/Ab 46 waist muscles versus just the front 6 pack. You may ask why it had taken 18 years to complete the First Smart Total Core Gym, it takes much more time to pursue a solution to a problem like Low Back pain and Sarcopenia ( body aging starting at age 25), than just designing a common exercise machine. Research has shown that a few minutes of strength training impacts over 179 genes to a more youthful level, ""10 YEARS ""YOUNGER"" than sedentary individual's; which can result in a 10-30 younger tighter healthier body, based on anti-aging experts. </p>
<p><u><i>Consider weight strengthening ""the mother of all weight-loss techniques"" SELF MAGAZINE</i></u></p>
<p>The Core 46 $1 million guarantee establishing that the Core 46 unit is the best Portable home core/Ab product in the world, offering $1 million challenge promotion to any Core/Ab/Belly Fat/Low Back Strengthening product or company that can in one exercise strengthen over 46 core muscles within 4 minutes more effective than the Core 46.</p>

<p>The challenge was to combine four $3,000 GYM Ab/Spine/Arm/Back core machines and 2 resistance stacks into one portable unit, that would strengthen all 46 core muscles that surrounds the waist compared to just strengthening the front 6 pack Ab muscles.</p>

<p>To fulfill this challenge, we spent 4 years to complete real university peer reviewed JOURNAL PUBLISHED studies, 9 years to complete 36 issued global patents and 7 years design and engineering. Body Core architecture &amp; strength is your most priceless health asset for wellness, youthful appearance and performance, yet 80% of the population do not strength train, primarily due to a lack of time, knowledge, cost and availability of a portable product that really works. The Core 46 compact Maverick unit is our solution for the consumer market, that's nearly completed and has never been offered in the market.</p>
<p>New life changing fitness research has emerged in the last few years, so we are passionate about communicating information that is scientifically based to improve your health and workout.

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Core XT 46 athletic unit is totally completed, passing all 32 SGS quality and chemical test.

            As experts and new research indicated above, that Cardio & Dieting, will not tighten your waist, burn calories 24 hour per day, burn belly fat, stop body aging and it only requires minutes with total CORE STRENGTHENING. There has been no Core/Ab machine until now that will tighten all Core/Ab 46 waist muscles versus just the front 6 pack. You may ask why it had taken 18 years to complete the First Smart Total Core Gym, it takes much more time to pursue a solution to a problem like Low Back pain and Sarcopenia ( body aging starting at age 25), than just designing a common exercise machine. Research has shown that a few minutes of strength training impacts over 179 genes to a more youthful level, ""10 YEARS ""YOUNGER"" than sedentary individual's; which can result in a 10-30 younger tighter healthier body, based on anti-aging experts. 
Consider weight strengthening ""the mother of all weight-loss techniques"" SELF MAGAZINE
The Core 46 $1 million guarantee establishing that the Core 46 unit is the best Portable home core/Ab product in the world, offering $1 million challenge promotion to any Core/Ab/Belly Fat/Low Back Strengthening product or company that can in one exercise strengthen over 46 core muscles within 4 minutes more effective than the Core 46.

The challenge was to combine four $3,000 GYM Ab/Spine/Arm/Back core machines and 2 resistance stacks into one portable unit, that would strengthen all 46 core muscles that surrounds the waist compared to just strengthening the front 6 pack Ab muscles.

To fulfill this challenge, we spent 4 years to complete real university peer reviewed JOURNAL PUBLISHED studies, 9 years to complete 36 issued global patents and 7 years design and engineering. Body Core architecture & strength is your most priceless health asset for wellness, youthful appearance and performance, yet 80% of the population do not strength train, primarily due to a lack of time, knowledge, cost and availability of a portable product that really works. The Core 46 compact Maverick unit is our solution for the consumer market, that's nearly completed and has never been offered in the market.
New life changing fitness research has emerged in the last few years, so we are passionate about communicating information that is scientifically based to improve your health and workout. Now we need your backing to finish the last stage of manufacturing and fulfill our passion to fight Sarcopenia and Low Back pain.



Research has shown that a few minutes of strength training impacts 179 genes to a more youthful level, ""10 YEARS YOUNGER"" than sedentary individual's; anti-aging experts concluded that body aging can be stopped maintaining a body of a 30 year old into your 50's,60's, 70's; with core resistance training.



 

The Core 46 activates the deeper muscles of the Ab, Spine, Back & Core muscles that no other gym or fitness machine can accomplish, based on the power of 2 resistance stacks and combining 4 core gym machines into one unit. Because the Core 46 works the deeper girdle core muscles, women will have sexier tighter hour glass appearance and men a V-shape, without the bulky appearance.

Core 46 is the FIRST AND ONLY TOTAL CORE MACHINE TO EFFECTIVELY IMPACT PERMANENT BODY AGING THAT begins at age 25, strength training all 46 core, Ab, Spine, Back muscles completely around the waist. ANTI-BODY AGING BEGINS IMMEDIATELY and within 30-60 days new body composition scupting occurs, resulting in a younger, healthier and tighter waist and body for both men and women; IN ONE 4 MINUTE WORKOUT COMPARABLE TO A 50 MINUTE GYM WORKOUT.










CORE 46 ONE MINUTE CHALLENGE
Core 46 changes the minds of the toughest & most skeptical weight lifters in Los Angeles in only 1 minute !!! The Core 46 is so effective & innovative has been pursued by professional sports teams as the Ram's & Lakers, celebrities and the medical/science community.

FIND OUT IF YOUR WORKOUT IS ENOUGH TO FIGHT SARCOPENIA OR BODY AGING?
If you're 25 or over and not strength training or just doing cardio, your core is rapidly aging losing 16 oz of muscle permanently per year, immediately replaced by fat, loss of bone, decreased sports performance and impacting 15 other wellness areas.
Sarcopenia, is ranked #1 out of the 10 bio-markers of aging as gray hair or wrinkling. Aging from the neck down is avoidable; click the video to find out if your cardio, yoga or current workout is enough to stop body aging or Sarcopenia .  FIND OUT CLICK VIDEO

<p>Our team noticed that an accurate track massage gun is very important for increasing the speed of muscle recovery. So we created Apex, the most accurate massage gun on the market. A higher speed (RPM) does not mean better muscle recovery. Higher and unstable speeds might even damage your muscles. Apex’s stable 1800 to 2700 RPM speed makes it the most ideal massager for both daily muscle relaxation and deep percussion treatment.</p>

</div></div>","Have you ever had sore muscles, sports injuries, or tense shoulders after a workout or a tiring day? A massage gun might just change your life.
 

 
A Massage gun relieves muscle soreness and stiffness, accelerates recovery, and increases blood and lymphatic flow, and can help you achieve better sleep.
 

 

 
Normal massage guns are noisy and they tire your wrist easily during use. Not to mention, 60% of the available massage guns are not powerful enough to reach deeper tissue layers. OPOVE Apex solves all those issues.
 

 

 
Our team collected more than 2000+ feedback responses from our previous users. Based on their suggestions, we created Apex, our next-gen massage gun.
 

 

 

 

 

 
Have you ever had an uncomfortable massage when using a normal massage gun? With our unique 45º holding angle design, you can massage your neck and back easily. This position is more comfortable for your wrist and provides the perfect angle for a better massage experience.
 

 

 
Normal massage guns are very heavy and tire your hand when using them. With our force-assisted technology, the massage gun uses its own weight to help massage your sore muscles with less fatigue of your hand.
 

 

 
With our patent and ergonomic design, Apex manages to centralize the weight into your palm without creating any strain on your Wrist & finger. You can even hold the massage gun without grabbing it. OPOVE Apex, created to bring you the easiest self-massage experience you have ever had.
 

 

 
70% of massage guns on the market are louder than car noise. So we created the world’s quietest massage gun, Apex. With OPOVE Quiet glide technology, Apex’s highest noise level is the other massage gun’s lowest noise level.
 

 

 

 
Amplitude is a very important indicator of a good massage gun. It is the key for a massage gun to reach the fascial layer of our muscles. Apex’s 14.5mm amplitude reaches the fascial layer deeper than 60% of other massagers.
 

 

 
Apex’s Powerful Brushless High-Torque Motor gives a range of 35-50lbs stall force. Stall force is the amount of force that can be applied to a device before the motor stalls. With a wide range of stall forces, you can massage at any level you want.
 

 

 
Our team noticed that an accurate track massage gun is very important for increasing the speed of muscle recovery. So we created Apex, the most accurate massage gun on the market. A higher speed (RPM) does not mean better muscle recovery. Higher and unstable speeds might even damage your muscles. Apex’s stable 1800 to 2700 RPM speed makes it the most ideal massager for both daily muscle relaxation and deep percussion treatment.
 

 

 

 
You will never drop Apex when using it. OPOVE Apex’s full coverage frosted design brings a futuristic appeal. The anti-slip silicone handle provides a safe and comfortable experience during use. Your massage gun will never slip from your hand, even when it is working at the highest speed.
 

 

 
Want to see the inside of the product? We got you. The exquisite see-through design reveals not only the OPOVE Powerful Brushless High-Torque Motor, but it also puts soothing rhythmic motion on display.

<strong>History</strong>
</div><p>Iancu, 
19 yrs-old,  is ready to take up the challenge of his life: play
professional.</p><div>

His story
starts in 2003 when Mr. Ovidiu Constantin  Popovici, Romanian Davis Cup  player, and former doubles-partner of Romanian star Ilie Nastase (# 1 ATP 1973 - 1974) , discovers Iancu, who than 7 yrs
of age was watching Popovici coach from outside the fence and the coach invited him in. When hitting with excellent technique for the
first time Iancu took the raquet in his hand, Popovici was impressed and told
our parents that Iancu has to play tennis, as he has a particular talent for the sport. Several months later Iancu's family
moved to Canada.</div><div>

Iancu had to start
at 0, with no money and  not knowing how he can train for tennis in Canada. Without
possibility to pay for tennis racquets and lessons Iancu knew that the only way for him of having any chance to play his sport was to fight
harder than the rest. He did it, since
the age of 7, when he was playing with old second-hand tennis racquets, and was
training with his brothers and sisters, not having money to pay for private lessons­. He would go for 6-7
hours training a day regardless of the conditions of the racquets, balls, weather or
fatigue.</div><div>

At age 12, when
he won the Quebec Championships he started to get sponsorship with Wilson for
the racquets.  He was named “Torpedo” by national coaches, because he was
known for his capacity  to reverse and win matches in which he was down 0-5. Finishing 3rd
in Canada in 16 yrs and younger, Iancu continued his training, and now at age 19 is
ready to play at the international professional level. He won the
Roman Cup at 12, 14 , 16 and 18 yrs old, and he won almost all the Open tournaments
in  Ottawa. Last year he participated to 8 ITF tournaments in Canada and won the first round for doubles in Winnipeg. In singles he got in the main draw on 18.08.14 at the Canada F8.</div><p>Ready to play
professional, Iancu works ha­rd everyday on the court and outside the court. He
trains intensively  at Ottawa Atheltic Club in Ottawa, ­and is motivated
to enter the international elite. He has 38 days
left for his dream to become reality: the moment he has been waited for so
long, to play against the best players around the world and get his ranking.</p><p>Be part of
Iancu’s journey, and help him make it reality!</p><div>
</div><p><b>What We Need
&amp; What You Get</b></p><div>
</div><p>This journey
has been planned to have 12 international ITF  tournaments in 3 countries. 5000$ is the amount needed for travel and housing in this journey for
international tennis ranking.  </p><div>
<b>The Impact</b>
</div><div>

My goal is to demonstrate to young athletes that it is possible if you 
really want something you can achieve it. If Iancu makes it professional
 it would be thanks to you, who help him at this important stage, when 
all the work has been done and the motivation is there, the last piece 
of the puzzle left being the ranking.</div><div>

There are a few perks available. After the tour, Iancu will do his best to post pictures and videos with the experience  to be made available to the contributors. Upon request, contributors over $100 may play a demonstrative game with Iancu in Ottawa in summer of 2015. <br/>

Here at the Santa Barbara Ventura Professional Chapter of Engineers Without Borders, we've found an opportunity to serve a community of Maasai in Tanzania - and we need your help. </p> </div> <div> <h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The Maasai </span><br/>
</h3>
<div>The Maasai are an ethnic community native to southern Kenya and northern Tanzania.  The village of Elerai-Olmoti in Tanzania is home to 600 Maasai and the nearest source of clean water was historically 6-10 miles away until recently whena  new access point was added just 3 miles away.   The women of the village, some of them nearly 70 years old, walk this distance to the closest water source and carry over 40 pounds of water on their back.  These constant trips cause neck and back issues and diminishes the productivity of the women in their home.  In addition, children in the community are susceptible to illness by drinking water from nearby open pit wells and by decreased hygiene from lack of sufficient water.  </div> </div> <div> <h3>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The Solution </span><br/>
</h3>
<div>The Magadini Makiwaru Water Supply (MMWS) is a Tanzanian NGO that manages a reliable water source in the adjacent Hai District.  MMWS was founded by the German government and therefore adheres to strict standards of water quality and construction.

</div></div>","The Tanzania Project Engineers Without Borders USA supports community-driven development programs worldwide by collaborating with local partners to design and implement sustainable engineering projects. Here at the Santa Barbara Ventura Professional Chapter of Engineers Without Borders, we've found an opportunity to serve a community of Maasai in Tanzania - and we need your help.    
The Maasai 

The Maasai are an ethnic community native to southern Kenya and northern Tanzania.  The village of Elerai-Olmoti in Tanzania is home to 600 Maasai and the nearest source of clean water was historically 6-10 miles away until recently whena  new access point was added just 3 miles away.   The women of the village, some of them nearly 70 years old, walk this distance to the closest water source and carry over 40 pounds of water on their back.  These constant trips cause neck and back issues and diminishes the productivity of the women in their home.  In addition, children in the community are susceptible to illness by drinking water from nearby open pit wells and by decreased hygiene from lack of sufficient water.     
The Solution 

The Magadini Makiwaru Water Supply (MMWS) is a Tanzanian NGO that manages a reliable water source in the adjacent Hai District.  MMWS was founded by the German government and therefore adheres to strict standards of water quality and construction. The MMWS continues to function as originally founded and is maintained by professionally trained staff of technicians and engineers.  
To bring clean water directly to the 600 Maasai of Elerai-Olmoti, the engineers from EWB SBV have designed a 3 mile pipeline to convey clean water to the Maasai.  The pipeline will include six public taps and three storage tanks.  The pipeline will provide 26 liters per person per day of clean, reliable water to each Maasai. We have traveled to Tanzania to establish a trusting relationship with the Maasai and their leaders.  We have identified the most practical path for the pipeline and we have obtained formal consent from the Maasai to build the pipeline.  The Maasai villagers also donated over $1,500 USD in cash, cows, and goats to the project!  They told us that they are ""eager"" to begin the project immediately.  Once the pipeline is constructed, the new pipeline and storage tanks will be maintained by the highly trained MMWS staff and community members. 
We now need your help to build the pipeline, tanks, and taps.     How You Can Help The cost to build and install the water pipeline and storage system is around $1.50 per foot of pipe, so we need $20,000 to complete our task.  Through our social media outlets (www.facebook.com/ewbsbvchapter), we will provide constant updates on our progress.
Our engineers have provided the professional expertise, and our volunteers will travel to Tanzania in May and June of 2015 to assist in the construction of the pipeline, tanks and taps.  All donations are first and foremost used to cover the costs of the materials - concrete, piping, rebar, tools, etc.  Any remaining funds will be used to help our engineers cover their travel costs.

Message: A private, anonymous email replacement</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Natural Message is an easy-to-use, encrypted email system that allows you to send messages over two ""transports:"" old-school email (SMTP) or the more anonymous Natural Message transport.<br/></p>
<p>This was our first campaign (February, 2015), which is now over--we might have a similar campaign in the future, so check <a href=""http://naturalmessage.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://naturalmessage.com</a> for the latest information.  After we started the campaign, it became clear that that people wanted to see the system in action before committing to the project, so we focussed on preparing the Mac OS X client and a simple client that can run on Windows and UNIX-like systems.  Right now (March, 2015) the simple client is a command-line client, but a future version will have a GUI interface.  We are starting to upload to github and will start testing the Mac OS X full client and the simple client soon.</p>
<p>You can review our original Indiegogo page here to get an idea of what we are doing.</p>
<h3>""Old school"" email compared to Natural Message</h3>

<h3>Natural Message: Details</h3>
<p>You can verify that third parties are not reading your messages because the actual content of your message is stored on independently operated servers that will delete the messages as soon as they are read (burn-on-read).  You can send test messages, and if the messages are burned before you read them, you know that your line is being tapped.  If you use the optional shared secret, no server will have the information to reassemble your message.<br/></p>
<p>You will be able to send secure messages to your existing email contacts without asking them to sign up for a new account and without establishing a shared secret (recipients will be able to use the free, simple client to read or write messages on Mac OS X, Windows, Linux, and maybe more).  You can enjoy greater anonymity (and privacy of your social network) by sending messages over the Natural Message network.</p>
<p>The client application helps you to do the right thing and avoid security mistakes.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Natural Message does not have the single-point-of-failure 
flaw like the so-called “secure” systems that run java script in your 
browser.</p>
<p>The client program splits your encrypted message into pieces (shards) and stores them on a distributed network with the keys held by independent custodians.  When using the Natural Message client, the thing that is ""mailed"" is small file (the shared metadata file) that allows the recipient to reassemble the message. When using the old-school email transport, the thing that is ""mailed"" is an encoded link to the the shard metadata--click the link to open the reader.  With either transport, the person or business that handles the message does not have possession or control over the shards (and can not legally retrieve them).</p>
<p>If you use the old-school email transport, email providers like Google, Yahoo, and GMX will not know where your message is located or how big it is (all they have is a specially-encoded link and a legal notice saying that the content is private).<br/></p>
<p>You can use an optional shared secret, in which case everything is encrypted again, and the shard metadata is encrypted so that the Natural Message directory server (the main server) will not know where your message is located (because the list of URLs that point to shards is encrypted with the shared secret that is known only by the sender and recipient).  <br/></p>
<p>When you use the Natural Message transport, the system does not track IP, location (GPS), time sent, or user information--not even a user nickname.<br/></p>Spam will be relegated to the history books.<br/><br/>Natural Message is as easy to use as an old-school email client other than the long addresses and once-per-year housekeeping.<br/><br/><p>We have a working server and a working client that need tuning.</p>
<h3>Project Goals</h3>
<b>Our
first goal is to tune the existing server software and release it
under a GNU public license, then release the Mac
OS X client (<i>requires the
latest OS X release</i>) with a GNU public licensed library. 
If we meet that goal during this campaign, then our next “stretch
goal” would be to release a simple client for Windows and Linux
(open source running in Python 3 with a simple GUI and basic features
along with a command line version for programmers). This campaign is
the first step toward implementing full-functionality clients for all
the major platforms.</b><br/><br/>Here is a table that illustrates our <b>goal</b> and <b>stretch goals</b> if we exceed our fundraising goals in this campaign.</div><div>

<h2>You can verify that third parties are not reading your messages</h2>
<p>Natural Message is a set of
client software, server software, protocols, and procedures for
sending verifiably private messages over one of two transports:
old-school email (SMTP) or the more secure Natural Message transport.  The
majority of this page is about the fully secure system that operates
over the the Natural Message transport layer, but users who want the
increased convenience (and loss of anonymity) of old-school email can
route encrypted messages over old-school email.  If you
use the old-school email transport, you will lack anonymity, meaning
that the following things might be tracked: your real identity linked
to an extended social network, your IP address, the time and location
of the originating message, and perhaps more—plus
you are rewarding those who have disregard for your privacy.</p>
<p>The essential feature of
Natural Message is the distribution of encrypted shards (pieces) of
your message with the keys to those shards protected with a second
layer of encryption before they are sliced into pieces and stored in
a network of shard servers that will be independently operated by
known, trusted custodians of your messages.  The shard servers hold
pieces of your encrypted file that are stored under randomly
generated, 128-bit names on servers that will be located around the
world.  The encrypted keys to unlock your message are sent directly
from the client's computer to shard servers.  All servers currently
require TLS 1.2 security, and the shards are burn-on-read, meaning
that when you read your messages, all traces of them are removed from
the Internet.</p>
<p>
Watch the video to get an idea
of what happens in the background:</p>
<p><br/></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FuLx3SE9q0ew%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DuLx3SE9q0ew&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FuLx3SE9q0ew%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p>It would be exceedingly
difficult for any hacker to find the pieces of your message (a brute
force attack would require guessing approximately nine 128-bit shard
IDs within 5 days).   If you do not read an incoming message, it is
expired and deleted in about 5-6 days.  Advertisers can't read your
messages, server operators can't read your messages, and governments
can't read your messages.  You can send test messages and verify that
no shards are unexpectedly burned.  If a shard is burned before you
read it, then you would know that somebody, somehow has invaded your
privacy.</p>
<h2>When using the Natural Message transport, the system does not track IP, location (GPS), time sent, or user information.</h2>
<p>Natural Message servers do not collect or save information about users, and no single computer has information about the contents of your original message, so the contents of your messages are not tracked.  The shard servers have no information about where the other shards are stored.  Natural Message servers have no place to store your name, IP address, physical address, GPS coordinates, credit card information, or even a nickname.</p>
<p>If you purchase a subscription for our service after the Indiegogo campaign, it might be through the Apple App Store.  The client application will confirm with Apple that your subscription is current but will not send any information to the Natural Message server about your identity or Apple account ID.  The client application will send a generic code that indicates that your subscription is current without identifying who you are.  We have other anonymous payment methods planned for the Simple Client (for those who want the ability to load large shards onto a fully supported network).</p>

Your message will be

key encryption key.  The first, encrypted password will be fragmented
and distributed across burn-on-read servers operated by known, independent custodians who have made a
commitment to privacy.  The key encryption key goes to the Natural

encrypted again so that the server operator can not read it (only
sender and receiver will have the key to unlock everything).</p>
<p>
For the server to read your

<p>
If you really don't trust the

shard of information to lock a potentially large message, so this
seems feasible even if you have a slow Internet connection.</p>

along with the key encryption key that is needed to decrypt the

<p>
</p>
<p>Spam
on the Natural Message
network will be
relegated to the history books, so server operators have fewer
excuses to demand personal information in exchange for an email
account, and governments will have no excuse for
ludicrous regulations on free speech (e.g., a $10 million
fine
for closing an email account 59 days after sending a perfectly legal

 sections 6[3] and 20[4]).</p>
<p>The
Natural Message system fights Spam in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Each
	Natural Message box ID (akin to an email address) includes an
	expiration date.  After that date, servers will not forward messages to that inbox.  You can generate new box IDs with quick expiration
	dates if you are going to post your ID in a public place.  After a month or so,
	the box ID expires, and servers will no longer send anything to that
	ID.  The temporary IDs route messages to your normal inbox.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Box
	IDs (akin to email addresses) are based on long, random strings that
	can not be guessed.  This avoids one of the techniques of Spammers,
	which is to send thousands of messages to random email addresses and
	see which ones do not come back with an error (random box IDs also
	mean that users can not leak information about their identities).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At
	the end of every year, users will create new box IDs and exchange
	contact info with friends (obviously you would not send your new
	contact info to somebody who has been sending you Spam).  Yes, this
	takes some time---you can open new accounts in October, and the old
	ones will be good until January 31.  The deadline is January of each
	year, but aim to finish the conversion by December.  The
	full-functionality client appliations will eventually facilitate
	this process to make it easy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because
	box IDs expire each year, people will not accumulate decades worth
	of Spam, and it will be less profitable to deal in the sale of box
	IDs for Spamming purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The
	free version of our Natural Message service will have a proof of
	work system.  If Spam (or denial of service) becomes a problem, the
	proof of work requirement will be increased.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Natural Message does not have the single-point-of-failure flaw like the so-called “secure” systems that run java script in your browser</h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>Applications
that encrypt messages in your web browser and store the key online
(encrypted with your password) are convenient, but they offer a false
sense of security.  A hacker, a dishonest server operator, or a
government agent who gains access to the server can make a small
change to the java script to leave the password unencrypted.  This is known as a single
point of failure because a hacker or government agent can make the
change in one place, and the malware will be automatically
distributed to users who load that web page.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>It
would be relatively easy for people to use the command line client
(assuming that our fundraising goal is reached) to send data from a
web form to a Natural Message box ID, and some users might want to do
this.  If users add such a form to their <b>own</b> web server, at
least the risk is not spread to other users.</p>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<h2>
</h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>There
are some features that might or might not be implemented depending on
review from the security and privacy community (e.g., alternative redundancy protocols, delivery to multiple recipients).  Our ability to
obtain outside security audits will depend on the success of our
campaign.  Better results on the campaign mean more thorough security
audits.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The
quality of the network will depend upon the number of collaborators
who agree to host free shard servers that hold tiny pieces of files
(currently 127 bytes of payload plus some overhead).  If you or your
organization is interested in hosting a shard server, contact us
using the current information on our contact page.  Remember that you
can protect the privacy of potentially large files by hosting tiny
shards of data.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The
current test version of the client version allows sending to only one
user at a time.  We have a mechanism for allowing multiple
recipients, but it needs technical review before we implement it.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The
Simple Natural Message Client will be functional, but will not have
all the features of the Mac OS X client or the planned iOS client. 
We hope to have the funding to build full-featured clients for all
major platforms, but the simple client is the best way that we can
make the system available to the widest audience in a short period of
time.  The Simple Natural Message Client will have a simple GUI
interface and a command line interface (for programmers).</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>You
can not communicate between a Natural Message box ID and an
old-school email address (because the anonymity of the Natural
Message system would lead to uncontrollable Spam being sent to
old-school email).  You can send old-school to old-school or Natural
Message to Natural Message, but you can not mix and match.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If
you want to use the old-school email transport, the best
functionality will require that you have an email client already
configured to use a regular email account.  The old-school email
transport works something like this: your Natural Message client
application prepares the shards and shard metadata, and then puts a
single link into your old-school email client (or you manually paste
the link into a web client).  The recipient clicks on the link, which
will hopefully cause Natural Message client to open and read the
message.  We plan to register a MIME type so that your computer will
recognize the URL and know that it should be opened with a Natural
Message client application (we do not have a timeline for when an official MIME type might be registered).</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If
you use the old-school email transport, the likes of Yahoo, Google,
GMX, AOL, and others can not legally discover where your Natural
Message is, even under warrant, but if they (or hackers) intercept
the old-school email and access your messages, you can know this
because your real messages or test messages will be burned.  None of
the big email providers will be able to routinely read your messages
without such practices being known to the global community, in which
case, upgrade to the Natural Message transport. <br/></p>
<p> Some features might require proof of work (running a little program 
to solve math problems) to avoid abuse.  Any proof of work will be 
performed by the client application.<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Because
one of our methods of supporting privacy is anonymity, we have no
information about who uses an account (for the Natural Message transport).  This means that we would have
no way to stop people from using fake reply-to addresses when using
the Natural Message transport.  Users can minimize any threat of
forged identity by (a) using many public box IDs (perhaps one ID per
contact--all routing to the same inbox), (b) exchanging a shared
secret, or (c) asking questions to verify the identity of other
users.  This is really no different than receiving an email from an
old friend--you can not be 100% that it is really your friend unless
you ask questions or take other precautions.  We have a complicated
challenge-response procedure that allows verification of a person
without leaking any of the answers unless the person knows all the
answers, but it is not practical for normal communications.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The
server currently runs on CentOS 7 (there were difficulties with
implementing the elliptic curve signing key in CentOS 6).  Our focus
will be on the one server platform until we have a moment to breathe
and test other platforms.  If you are good with Linux, you can
probably install the server on Debian or other such operating
systems.</p>

Message: A private, anonymous email replacement


Natural Message is an easy-to-use, encrypted email system that allows you to send messages over two ""transports:"" old-school email (SMTP) or the more anonymous Natural Message transport.
This was our first campaign (February, 2015), which is now over--we might have a similar campaign in the future, so check http://naturalmessage.com for the latest information.  After we started the campaign, it became clear that that people wanted to see the system in action before committing to the project, so we focussed on preparing the Mac OS X client and a simple client that can run on Windows and UNIX-like systems.  Right now (March, 2015) the simple client is a command-line client, but a future version will have a GUI interface.  We are starting to upload to github and will start testing the Mac OS X full client and the simple client soon.
You can review our original Indiegogo page here to get an idea of what we are doing.
""Old school"" email compared to Natural Message





Natural Message: Details
You can verify that third parties are not reading your messages because the actual content of your message is stored on independently operated servers that will delete the messages as soon as they are read (burn-on-read).  You can send test messages, and if the messages are burned before you read them, you know that your line is being tapped.  If you use the optional shared secret, no server will have the information to reassemble your message.
You will be able to send secure messages to your existing email contacts without asking them to sign up for a new account and without establishing a shared secret (recipients will be able to use the free, simple client to read or write messages on Mac OS X, Windows, Linux, and maybe more).  You can enjoy greater anonymity (and privacy of your social network) by sending messages over the Natural Message network.
The client application helps you to do the right thing and avoid security mistakes.

Natural Message does not have the single-point-of-failure 
flaw like the so-called “secure” systems that run java script in your 
browser.
The client program splits your encrypted message into pieces (shards) and stores them on a distributed network with the keys held by independent custodians.  When using the Natural Message client, the thing that is ""mailed"" is small file (the shared metadata file) that allows the recipient to reassemble the message. When using the old-school email transport, the thing that is ""mailed"" is an encoded link to the the shard metadata--click the link to open the reader.  With either transport, the person or business that handles the message does not have possession or control over the shards (and can not legally retrieve them).
If you use the old-school email transport, email providers like Google, Yahoo, and GMX will not know where your message is located or how big it is (all they have is a specially-encoded link and a legal notice saying that the content is private).
You can use an optional shared secret, in which case everything is encrypted again, and the shard metadata is encrypted so that the Natural Message directory server (the main server) will not know where your message is located (because the list of URLs that point to shards is encrypted with the shared secret that is known only by the sender and recipient).  
When you use the Natural Message transport, the system does not track IP, location (GPS), time sent, or user information--not even a user nickname.Spam will be relegated to the history books.Natural Message is as easy to use as an old-school email client other than the long addresses and once-per-year housekeeping.We have a working server and a working client that need tuning.
Project Goals
Our
first goal is to tune the existing server software and release it
under a GNU public license, then release the Mac
OS X client (requires the
latest OS X release) with a GNU public licensed library. 
If we meet that goal during this campaign, then our next “stretch
goal” would be to release a simple client for Windows and Linux
(open source running in Python 3 with a simple GUI and basic features
along with a command line version for programmers). This campaign is
the first step toward implementing full-functionality clients for all
the major platforms.Here is a table that illustrates our goal and stretch goals if we exceed our fundraising goals in this campaign.




Notes:



Deploy servers worldwide to achieve security objectives and allow for public testing and evaluation.


Release server endpoint API’s, data structures & security methods into public knowledge for evaluation by security/software development experts.


Deploy a modern Apple Mac client beyond the proof of concept along with the first version of the Objective-C open source library. This same API may also allow development of iOS based clients.


A client with simple GUI (Python) for Windows & Linux plus a command line version for programmers. While it will take us a while to deliver on this, getting to this level enables major desktop platforms.


Deploy Apple iPhone/iPod mobile client with a refined Objective-C open source library which contains any iPhone/iPod dependencies.


Deploy an Apple iPad mobile client with a completed Objective-C open source version 1.0 library containing any iPad dependencies.


The apps built under 4-7 for Microsoft, Linux and Apple platforms will be more refined applications with better UI/UX. Security audit as well.



Our long-term roadmap includes releasing full functionality applications along with open source libraries that are tuned to run on other operating systems (Windows, Android, Linux, etc.), localizing applications to other languages, and developing a version that would meet the needs of large businesses. The enterprise version would add features that would be useful for businesses that want more control over in-house messaging or want to be able secure messages on their own servers even if the message is sent outside the firewall. This chart depicts that future roadmap.


You can verify that third parties are not reading your messages
Natural Message is a set of
client software, server software, protocols, and procedures for
sending verifiably private messages over one of two transports:
old-school email (SMTP) or the more secure Natural Message transport.  The
majority of this page is about the fully secure system that operates
over the the Natural Message transport layer, but users who want the
increased convenience (and loss of anonymity) of old-school email can
route encrypted messages over old-school email.  If you
use the old-school email transport, you will lack anonymity, meaning
that the following things might be tracked: your real identity linked
to an extended social network, your IP address, the time and location
of the originating message, and perhaps more—plus
you are rewarding those who have disregard for your privacy.
The essential feature of
Natural Message is the distribution of encrypted shards (pieces) of
your message with the keys to those shards protected with a second
layer of encryption before they are sliced into pieces and stored in
a network of shard servers that will be independently operated by
known, trusted custodians of your messages.  The shard servers hold
pieces of your encrypted file that are stored under randomly
generated, 128-bit names on servers that will be located around the
world.  The encrypted keys to unlock your message are sent directly
from the client's computer to shard servers.  All servers currently
require TLS 1.2 security, and the shards are burn-on-read, meaning
that when you read your messages, all traces of them are removed from
the Internet.

Watch the video to get an idea
of what happens in the background:

It would be exceedingly
difficult for any hacker to find the pieces of your message (a brute
force attack would require guessing approximately nine 128-bit shard
IDs within 5 days).   If you do not read an incoming message, it is
expired and deleted in about 5-6 days.  Advertisers can't read your
messages, server operators can't read your messages, and governments
can't read your messages.  You can send test messages and verify that
no shards are unexpectedly burned.  If a shard is burned before you
read it, then you would know that somebody, somehow has invaded your
privacy.
When using the Natural Message transport, the system does not track IP, location (GPS), time sent, or user information.
Natural Message servers do not collect or save information about users, and no single computer has information about the contents of your original message, so the contents of your messages are not tracked.  The shard servers have no information about where the other shards are stored.  Natural Message servers have no place to store your name, IP address, physical address, GPS coordinates, credit card information, or even a nickname.
If you purchase a subscription for our service after the Indiegogo campaign, it might be through the Apple App Store.  The client application will confirm with Apple that your subscription is current but will not send any information to the Natural Message server about your identity or Apple account ID.  The client application will send a generic code that indicates that your subscription is current without identifying who you are.  We have other anonymous payment methods planned for the Simple Client (for those who want the ability to load large shards onto a fully supported network).
The client application helps you to do the right thing and avoid security mistakes.
One thing that the full functionality client application does for you is isolate your identities.  You might have one identity that you use with your friends from work and one that you use for your political activism.  The contact list and box ID (akin to an email address) for your work identity would be separate from the box ID and contact list for your school identity.  You would not accidentally send your political essay to a person from work because your work contacts are not visible from your political identity.  Also, the Natural Message servers would have no information in the database that would link the two identities (under a warrant, a server operator might be forced to trace your IP, so use the Natural Message Mix Network when it is ready [not a deliverable under this campaign, but on the drawing board and relatively easy to implement if people are willing to run the servers]).Here is a screenshot of the OS X proof of concept application depicting identity isolation:


The client application allows you to associate nicknames with the box IDs in your contact list, but those nicknames are never sent to the server.  When you generate a new box ID, the client application creates a random code for you so that you do not accidentally leak personal information in the box ID.
Messages will be automatically encrypted by the client computer, and the keys will be held by independent, trusted custodians.



Your message will be
compressed and encrypted with an automatically generate one-time
password which will then be encrypted by a second password, called a
key encryption key.  The first, encrypted password will be fragmented
and distributed across burn-on-read servers operated by known, independent custodians who have made a

user applies the optional shared secret, the shard metadata file is
encrypted again so that the server operator can not read it (only

For the server to read your
message without your knowledge, it would have to conspire with enough
server operators to get all the pieces that form your original

not burn the messages after they are read.

If you really don't trust the

hold your key shards, or use the shard server of a person or
organization whom you trust.  You would need to store only a tiny
shard of information to lock a potentially large message, so this
seems feasible even if you have a slow Internet connection.
Here are two diagrams of the classic ""Alice sends a message to Bob"" frequently cited in technical discussions of encryption. They depict the high-level functionality of what happens to your messages when sent over the Natural Message network.




There is no need to exchange passwords, but if you use the ultimate security option, the main messaging server will not even know where your message is.
When you use the optional
shared secret, the directory server (the main Natural Message machine)
would receive a tiny file that contains the destination box ID (the
code for the destination address), a legal notice, and an encrypted
block of data that can be read only by sender and recipient.  The
block of code contains links to the shards that comprise the message,
along with the key encryption key that is needed to decrypt the
original encryption key.  Without the shared secret, the server can
see the list of URLs that point to the message shard, but it would be
a crime for the server operator to access those URLs.  You you can
test if the server is corrupt by sending test messages to see if your
shards are unexpectedly burned.

Service providers who use the GNU public licensed server software will never have possession, custody, or control over the ultimate content of your messageThe phrase “possession,
custody, or control” comes directly from the U.S.
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the U.S.
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  They say that a party may be
compelled to produce any evidence that is in their possession,
custody, or control.  In other words, if something is not in the
possession, custody or control of a server operator, then the server
operator does not need to produce it (and it also implies that it
would be a crime for the server operator to steal it for the purpose
of producing it).The rules used by U.S. courts
provide objective criteria for evaluating the privacy of the Natural

that spans multiple legal jurisdictions, and each shard server
operator lacks information about the message itself (there is no

Spam will be relegated to the history books.

Simple Natural Message Client will be functional, but will not have
all the features of the Mac OS X client or the planned iOS client. 
We hope to have the funding to build full-featured clients for all
major platforms, but the simple client is the best way that we can
make the system available to the widest audience in a short period of
time.  The Simple Natural Message Client will have a simple GUI
interface and a command line interface (for programmers).


You
can not communicate between a Natural Message box ID and an
old-school email address (because the anonymity of the Natural
Message system would lead to uncontrollable Spam being sent to
old-school email).  You can send old-school to old-school or Natural
Message to Natural Message, but you can not mix and match.


If
you want to use the old-school email transport, the best
functionality will require that you have an email client already
configured to use a regular email account.  The old-school email
transport works something like this: your Natural Message client
application prepares the shards and shard metadata, and then puts a
single link into your old-school email client (or you manually paste
the link into a web client).  The recipient clicks on the link, which
will hopefully cause Natural Message client to open and read the
message.  We plan to register a MIME type so that your computer will
recognize the URL and know that it should be opened with a Natural
Message client application (we do not have a timeline for when an official MIME type might be registered).


If
you use the old-school email transport, the likes of Yahoo, Google,
GMX, AOL, and others can not legally discover where your Natural
Message is, even under warrant, but if they (or hackers) intercept
the old-school email and access your messages, you can know this
because your real messages or test messages will be burned.  None of
the big email providers will be able to routinely read your messages
without such practices being known to the global community, in which
case, upgrade to the Natural Message transport. 
 Some features might require proof of work (running a little program 
to solve math problems) to avoid abuse.  Any proof of work will be 
performed by the client application.


Because
one of our methods of supporting privacy is anonymity, we have no
information about who uses an account (for the Natural Message transport).  This means that we would have
no way to stop people from using fake reply-to addresses when using
the Natural Message transport.  Users can minimize any threat of
forged identity by (a) using many public box IDs (perhaps one ID per
contact--all routing to the same inbox), (b) exchanging a shared
secret, or (c) asking questions to verify the identity of other
users.  This is really no different than receiving an email from an
old friend--you can not be 100% that it is really your friend unless
you ask questions or take other precautions.  We have a complicated
challenge-response procedure that allows verification of a person
without leaking any of the answers unless the person knows all the
answers, but it is not practical for normal communications.


The
server currently runs on CentOS 7 (there were difficulties with
implementing the elliptic curve signing key in CentOS 6).  Our focus
will be on the one server platform until we have a moment to breathe
and test other platforms.  If you are good with Linux, you can
probably install the server on Debian or other such operating
systems.",7.0,1,"1 Campaign

<b>How does

<p>The

<div></div>My method to training your body can be compared to a 'dietary supplement' which will allow you to<b> reach higher levels</b> and <b>perform over a longer period</b> of time.<br/>
</div><div>
<p></p>There are <b>5</b> <b>core elements </b>to avoid injuries and be able to constantly overcome your physical barriers. Each core element has been divided into <b>7</b> <b>games.</b>

</ul>
<div><br/></div>
</div><div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>-Increasing<b> Coordination</b> will make your decision making faster and more accurate during exercise.<br/></p>
<p>-By training <b>Fluidity</b>, you will achieve a greater effectivity in the kinetic chain ( the connection of one joint to the next one) and therefore greater speed.<br/></p>
<p>-<b>Strength</b>, means muscle strength which stabilizes the body when moving, and  determines how powerful and effective you start or stop a movement.<br/></p>
<p>-<b>Functionality</b> exercises promote the proper functioning of the body structures (e.g. The spinal chord), and help prevent and recover from injury.<br/></p>
<p>-<b>Versatility</b> means the ability to adapt to an exercise, as well as how creative, varied and free you are able to move.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
Each
game consists of a combination of specific exercises, diagrams and
information. Allowing you to quickly <b>understand the
""hack""</b> that allows you to progress in each
element. You'll <b>evolve by understanding</b> rather than
imitating.</p>
<p>
The
Circular Training Guide helps you easily <b>adapt your training
to your daily life</b>. It will help you keep record of what you have
already achieved, and what to do in your next session.</p>
<p>
The
different games can be played for 5 minutes each,
in 5 periods throughout the day. Playing
for <b>7 days</b> will <b>complete a cycle of the
course</b>. For every cycle you complete you will improve and balance
your '<b>Pentagon of Skills</b>'.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>All
the basic elements of your body are <b>interdependent.</b> When
practicing in an integral way, improving one means improving the
rest.  The body works as a whole!  </p>The course is structured like a game rather than a formal training course. Through play we <b>develop the habit</b> of practicing the basic elements in the most effective and fun way. <b>Playing</b> is the essence of sport!</div><div>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">  The Campaign</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The campaign sum of  £15,000 will go towards<b> producing a compelling course</b> to cover the following costs: </p>
<ul>
<li>Video Production and Editing </li>
<li>Drawings and Diagrams</li>
<li>Course Programming <br/>
</li>
<li>Translations</li>
<li> Website<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The course would mostly be in a video format, along with texts and diagrams to understand<b> what to do</b> and<b> what happens</b> in your body when you do them.  </p>
<p>The plan is to initially produce a course that can be downloaded onto your computer or be used on line. </p>
<p>I believe the course needs to be fresh, youthful and inspiring for children and adults to enjoy using and learning from it.</p>
<p>In case we don't reach our campaign target, we will nevertheless produce the course and fit it to the budget. The information and exercises would be the same, but the course's user friendliness and presentation would be affected.<br/></p>

<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Personally, I have always challenged myself to overcome my physical limitations. </span><br/>
</div>
<div>Because of my attitude to life; enjoying the present moment rather than over planning or controlling it. I fit my passion for sports and physical practices into my daily life: as a student, whilst traveling, whilst working and now as father.<br/><br/>Practicing over the years, I have realised that it <b>is possible</b> to constantly overcome the bodies limits. Creating a <b>sense of evolution</b>. <br/><br/>This progression <b>motivates</b> me to keep pushing and <b>inspires</b> me to share how.  <br/><div> As a result, I feel charged with purpose and vitality in life. </div>

</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<div>This course is part of a wider project to <b>inspire </b>and <b>educate</b> people how to use and care for their bodies.  </div>
<div>All money we raise after we hit our campaign target will go towards two key areas I think will help propel this method to the general public. </div>
<div>1) I'd wish to personally tour schools, starting in Scotland, to inspire children. As part of the tour I want to give away happy sacks so that  children can already start playing one core element (leg coordination). </div>
<div></div>My <b>personal hope</b> is that they will get in groups, nudge each other to play and overcome their boundaries, care for their bodies while having fun.</div><div><p>I
believe that the younger generations who apply this method will tap
into their potential and reach levels that previous generations have
not been able to. The evolution of sport lies with them!

<p>Tras estudiar Ciencias del Deporte y dedicar más de 12 años a comprender las bases de la salud y las habilidades físicas, creo que el deporte y la actividad física pueden practicarse de manera

<p>Durante los últimos años, he enseñado a diferentes practicantes de actividades físicas y me he dado cuenta de que este método funciona para todo tipo de personas y edades.<br/></p>
<p>Puede ser practicado por sí mismo o como <b>complemento </b>para mejorar cualquier actividad física que realices, ayudándote a desarrollar un '<b>Cuerpo Versátil'</b>. Un cuerpo que se adapta rápidamente a cualquier práctica deportiva. </p>

<div><br/></div>
<p>Este método de entrenamiento físico podría ser comparada a un 'suplemento dietético', el cual  te permite rendir a niveles más elevados y durante más años.</p>
<p>He simplificado éste al máximo, de manera que pueda ser comprendido y aplicado por niños de unos 10 años, pasando por deportistas de élite, hasta personas mayores.  </p>Hay <b>5 elementos básicos</b> para evitar lesiones y poder superar constantemente los límites del cuerpo. Cada uno ha sido dividido en<b> 7 juegos</b>.</div>

<p><br/></p>
<p>-Mediante el incremento de la <b>Coordinación</b> se agiliza la toma de decisiones durante el ejercicio, así como la precisión de éstas.</p>
<p>-Entrenando la <b>Fluidez</b> se consigue eficacia en las cadenas cinéticas (transición del movimiento de una articulación a la siguiente), y así  aumentar la velocidad.</p>
<p>-La<b> Fuerza</b> muscular es clave en la estabilidad del cuerpo durante los movimientos, así como en la  potencia y eficacia para frenar un movimiento e iniciar uno nuevo.</p>
<p>-Los ejercicios de <b>Funcionalidad</b> favorecen el correcto funcionamiento de las estructuras  corporales, así como la prevención y recuperación de lesiones.<br/></p>
<p>-La <b>Versatilidad</b> determina la capacidad de adaptación ante el ejercicio demandado, así como la creatividad, libertad y variedad de movimientos. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Cada juego consiste en una combinación de vídeos tutoriales, diagramas, ilustraciones e información que te permite rápidamente <b>comprender ""el truco"" </b>que posibilita<b> </b>la<b> </b>progresión<b> </b>en cada elemento. Así puedes progresar mediante la comprensión en lugar de la imitación.</p>
<p>La guía de Entrenamiento Circular ha sido especialmente desarrollada para permitir<b> adaptar </b>tu<b> práctica </b>a tu<b> día cotidiano</b>. Te ayudará a tener un registro de lo que has hecho y una guía de lo que deberías practicar en tu próxima sesión.</p>
<p>Los distintos juegos se practican por <b>5</b> <b>minutos</b> en<b> 5</b> <b>periodos</b> a lo largo del día. Jugando durante <b>7 días</b> habrás completado <b>un ciclo del curso</b>. Por cada ciclo que completas aumentas y equilibras tu 'Pentágono de Habilidades'.</p>

<p>Los 5 elementos básicos son<b> interdependientes.</b> Lo que significa que, al practicar de manera integral, aumentando tu nivel en uno estás aumentándolo en los demás. El cuerpo realmente funciona como un todo!</p>
<p>El curso está estructurado como un juego en lugar de un entrenamiento formal. A través del juego podemos <b>desarrollar</b> el<b> hábito</b> de la práctica de manera divertida y eficaz.  <b>Jugar</b> es la<b> esencia</b> del deporte!<br/></p>

I'm Javi, a spanish guy living in Scotland.I've developed my own training method to improve your health and skills investing the least amount of time and interruption in your daily life.My aim is to offer this knowledge in an affordable online course.After studying a degree in Sports Science, and devoting over 12 years to understand the basics of health and physical abilities, I've realised that sports can be done in a 
efficient and harmonious way that won't injure or consume your body over
 time.For the last few years, I've coached different sport practitioners, and I've realised that this method works for people of all ages and kinds.It can be practiced by itself or as a complement to improve your current physical activity, and will help you develop a 'Versatile Body'. A body that can swiftly adapt from the needs of one activity to the needs of another.                                   The Course 
My method to training your body can be compared to a 'dietary supplement' which will allow you to reach higher levels and perform over a longer period of time.

There are 5 core elements to avoid injuries and be able to constantly overcome your physical barriers. Each core element has been divided into 7 games.
 
Course Content:

Seven Coordination Games 
Seven Fluidity Games
Seven Strength Games
Seven Functionality Games
Seven Versatility Games
Circular Training Guide





-Increasing Coordination will make your decision making faster and more accurate during exercise.
-By training Fluidity, you will achieve a greater effectivity in the kinetic chain ( the connection of one joint to the next one) and therefore greater speed.
-Strength, means muscle strength which stabilizes the body when moving, and  determines how powerful and effective you start or stop a movement.
-Functionality exercises promote the proper functioning of the body structures (e.g. The spinal chord), and help prevent and recover from injury.
-Versatility means the ability to adapt to an exercise, as well as how creative, varied and free you are able to move.


Each
game consists of a combination of specific exercises, diagrams and
information. Allowing you to quickly understand the
""hack"" that allows you to progress in each
element. You'll evolve by understanding rather than
imitating.

The
Circular Training Guide helps you easily adapt your training
to your daily life. It will help you keep record of what you have
already achieved, and what to do in your next session.

The
different games can be played for 5 minutes each,
in 5 periods throughout the day. Playing
for 7 days will complete a cycle of the
course. For every cycle you complete you will improve and balance
your 'Pentagon of Skills'.
 



All
the basic elements of your body are interdependent. When
practicing in an integral way, improving one means improving the
rest.  The body works as a whole!  The course is structured like a game rather than a formal training course. Through play we develop the habit of practicing the basic elements in the most effective and fun way. Playing is the essence of sport!
"" We are what we repeatedly do, Greatness is not an act but a habit "". -Plato



  The Campaign

The campaign sum of  £15,000 will go towards producing a compelling course to cover the following costs: 

Video Production and Editing 
Drawings and Diagrams
Course Programming 

Translations
 Website


The course would mostly be in a video format, along with texts and diagrams to understand what to do and what happens in your body when you do them.  
The plan is to initially produce a course that can be downloaded onto your computer or be used on line. 
I believe the course needs to be fresh, youthful and inspiring for children and adults to enjoy using and learning from it.
In case we don't reach our campaign target, we will nevertheless produce the course and fit it to the budget. The information and exercises would be the same, but the course's user friendliness and presentation would be affected.


                                      My Journey


Personally, I have always challenged myself to overcome my physical limitations. 

Because of my attitude to life; enjoying the present moment rather than over planning or controlling it. I fit my passion for sports and physical practices into my daily life: as a student, whilst traveling, whilst working and now as father.Practicing over the years, I have realised that it is possible to constantly overcome the bodies limits. Creating a sense of evolution. This progression motivates me to keep pushing and inspires me to share how.   As a result, I feel charged with purpose and vitality in life. 







The Project 


This course is part of a wider project to inspire and educate people how to use and care for their bodies.  
All money we raise after we hit our campaign target will go towards two key areas I think will help propel this method to the general public. 
1) I'd wish to personally tour schools, starting in Scotland, to inspire children. As part of the tour I want to give away happy sacks so that  children can already start playing one core element (leg coordination). 
My personal hope is that they will get in groups, nudge each other to play and overcome their boundaries, care for their bodies while having fun.I
believe that the younger generations who apply this method will tap
into their potential and reach levels that previous generations have
not been able to. The evolution of sport lies with them!


 


2) I would like to work with either the University of Granada or Marseille and make a scientifically rigorous study using around 20 athletes from different sports, to see the effects of this method on their bodies and performances over a period of 1,  3, 6  and 12 months.  







Contributing to this campaign will mean my personal dream of making the course available to a great number of people will come true.

A balanced body means a fulfilling life! 


If you care, please share!                                               




Bienvenido! Soy Javi, un español viviendo en Escocia. 
He desarrollado un método de entrenamiento parar aumentar la salud y la destreza física, invirtiendo un mínimo de tiempo y cambios en el día a día. 
Mi propósito es ofrecer este conocimiento en un formato online asequible.
 



Tras estudiar Ciencias del Deporte y dedicar más de 12 años a comprender las bases de la salud y las habilidades físicas, creo que el deporte y la actividad física pueden practicarse de manera 
eficaz y armoniosa, evitando lesiones y el desgaste del cuerpo.
Durante los últimos años, he enseñado a diferentes practicantes de actividades físicas y me he dado cuenta de que este método funciona para todo tipo de personas y edades.
Puede ser practicado por sí mismo o como complemento para mejorar cualquier actividad física que realices, ayudándote a desarrollar un 'Cuerpo Versátil'. Un cuerpo que se adapta rápidamente a cualquier práctica deportiva. 




 
El Curso

Este método de entrenamiento físico podría ser comparada a un 'suplemento dietético', el cual  te permite rendir a niveles más elevados y durante más años.
He simplificado éste al máximo, de manera que pueda ser comprendido y aplicado por niños de unos 10 años, pasando por deportistas de élite, hasta personas mayores.  Hay 5 elementos básicos para evitar lesiones y poder superar constantemente los límites del cuerpo. Cada uno ha sido dividido en 7 juegos.


Contenido del curso:


Siete Juegos de Coordinación



Siete Juegos de Fluidez
Siete Juegos de Fuerza
Siete Juegos de Funcionalidad
Siete Juegos de Versatilidad
Guía de Entrenamiento Circular 





-Mediante el incremento de la Coordinación se agiliza la toma de decisiones durante el ejercicio, así como la precisión de éstas.
-Entrenando la Fluidez se consigue eficacia en las cadenas cinéticas (transición del movimiento de una articulación a la siguiente), y así  aumentar la velocidad.
-La Fuerza muscular es clave en la estabilidad del cuerpo durante los movimientos, así como en la  potencia y eficacia para frenar un movimiento e iniciar uno nuevo.
-Los ejercicios de Funcionalidad favorecen el correcto funcionamiento de las estructuras  corporales, así como la prevención y recuperación de lesiones.
-La Versatilidad determina la capacidad de adaptación ante el ejercicio demandado, así como la creatividad, libertad y variedad de movimientos. 

Cada juego consiste en una combinación de vídeos tutoriales, diagramas, ilustraciones e información que te permite rápidamente comprender ""el truco"" que posibilita la progresión en cada elemento. Así puedes progresar mediante la comprensión en lugar de la imitación.
La guía de Entrenamiento Circular ha sido especialmente desarrollada para permitir adaptar tu práctica a tu día cotidiano. Te ayudará a tener un registro de lo que has hecho y una guía de lo que deberías practicar en tu próxima sesión.
Los distintos juegos se practican por 5 minutos en 5 periodos a lo largo del día. Jugando durante 7 días habrás completado un ciclo del curso. Por cada ciclo que completas aumentas y equilibras tu 'Pentágono de Habilidades'.




Los 5 elementos básicos son interdependientes. Lo que significa que, al practicar de manera integral, aumentando tu nivel en uno estás aumentándolo en los demás. El cuerpo realmente funciona como un todo!
El curso está estructurado como un juego en lugar de un entrenamiento formal. A través del juego podemos desarrollar el hábito de la práctica de manera divertida y eficaz.  Jugar es la esencia del deporte!
"" Somos lo que repetidamente hacemos, la grandeza no es un acto sino un hábito "". -Platón


 
   La
Campaña

El dinero recaudado en este campaña se destinará a cubrir los siguientes gastos de producción del curso:



	Producción
	y edición de Vídeos  



	Ilustraciones
	y gráficos



	Traducciones 



	Diseño
	gráfico 



	Programación



El
curso será mayormente en formato vídeo, con textos, ilustraciones y
gráficos para comprender qué hacer y qué sucede en el cuerpo
cuando lo haces. 

El
plan es producir un curso que pueda ser descargado en tu ordenador o
bien usado en línea. 
El curso se presentará bajo un diseño fresco y juvenil, que inspire tanto a niños como a adultos a usarlo y aprender de él.
En el caso de no llegar a nuestro objetivo de la campaña, continuaremos con la producción del el curso ajustándolo al presupuesto. La información y los ejercicios serían los mismos, pero la facilidad de uso del curso y presentación se verían afectadas.


 Mi Historia






Personalmente, siempre he buscado poder superar mis limitaciones físicas invirtiendo un mínimo de tiempo y cambios en mi día a día. 
Mi actitud hacia la vida ha sido generalmente de disfrutar el momento presente, en lugar de sobre planearlo o controlarlo. Poco a poco he ido aprendido a adaptar mi pasión por la actividad física a mi día cotidiano. Ya fuera como estudiante universitario, viajando, trabajando o ahora como padre.       

A través de la práctica y estudios, he comprendido que los límites del cuerpo pueden ser superados constantemente, cultivando así un sentido de evolución. Esta progresión realmente me motiva e inspira.
Como resultado, me siento recargado con propósito y energía en mi vida.            




El Proyecto 

Este curso es parte de un proyecto mayor para inspirar y educar a la gente sobre cómo usar y cuidar sus cuerpos.
Cualquier dinero recibido tras llegar al objetivo de la campaña se destinará a dos áreas claves que creo ayudarán a impulsar este método para el público en general; 
1) Deseo recorrer colegios e institutos, comenzando en Escocia, para inspirar a niños y adolescentes. Quiero poder regalar pelotas hackys  para que puedan empezar a practicar un elemento central (coordinación de piernas).       Mi esperanza personal es que se reúnan en grupos, motivándose entre sí para jugar y superar sus límites, cuidando sus cuerpos  mientras se divierten.
Creo que las generaciones más jóvenes, aplicando este método, alcanzarán un sorprendente nivel  de movimiento. La evolución del deporte recae en ellos!      





2) Me gustaría trabajar, bien con la Universidad de Granada o la de Marsella, y hacer un estudio científico, utilizando alrededor de 20 atletas de diferentes deportes para ver los efectos de este método en sus rendimientos durante un período de 1, 3, 6 y 12 meses.




Contribuir a esta campaña significará que mi sueño personal de dar a conocer este método a un gran número de personas se hará realidad.
Un cuerpo equilibrado significa una vida más plena.

<p>A double blind clinical trial was conducted at Emory University Children’s Hospital in conjunction with the Georgia Department of Human Resources, Atlanta, GA and University of Massachusetts, Boston.  More than 500 children between the ages of 6 months to 6 years were tested.  The research results, soon to be published in The Journal of Clinical Toxicology, show that oral fluid is in all cases more reliable than any saliva test and in fact is as reliable as a venous blood test, because blood plasma is being collected in the oral fluid.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435796373/hhdbwqdvx9oskbulovxk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Dr. S Lynn Gardener, one of the authors of the study, presented our “Non-Invasive Lead Testing Technology” at the Center for Disease Control (CDC) National Conference in October 2009 and received much praise and support from the attendees.  The study demonstrated that by using OFT’s patented collection and testing procedures, the results comparing the non-invasive, painless oral swab procedure versus an invasive painful blood test were extremely accurate.</p>
<p>The new screening test kit “<b><u>Toxyscreen</u></b>”, a product of OFT Labs, is designed to make it easy for concerned parents to test their children. All information needed for proper collection and fast, easy test results is in the Oral Fluid Screening test kit delivered right to your door.</p>
<p>The blood plasma collected in the oral fluid can not only detect drugs but also heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury,  Cadmium, Aluminum, Arsenic, Zinc Copper and Chromium, poison, and almost anything else a standard blood test can find.  This includes recreational and prescription drugs, hormones, HGH, and maybe even different types of cancers--all with just an easy swab of the gum line.</p>

<p><span>This enormous, patented discovery identified by sheer persistence to find an option for more dignified testing, would eliminate the need to draw blood to detect overexposure to lead and heavy metals.  You can now test your family’s and pet’s levels of four toxic heavy metals: lead, arsenic, mercury and cadmium. Heavy metals are potentially deadly elements that can cause a host of health problems. Often heavy metal poisoning is misdiagnosed, and patients may not receive the correct treatment.  Lead tests in particular often go undone because the hazard of lead poisoning are unknown though fairly common, and parents don’t want the challenge and anxiety of a blood draw.</span></p>

<h2><b>OUR STORY</b></h2>
<p>Meet Ed and Gene, the founders of OFT Labs and creators of a revolutionary testing method that will nullify the need for blood draws for heavy metal testing, replacing it with an oral fluid swab test.</p>
<p>These two South Jersey natives have been best friends since Kindergarten.  That’s right, they knew each other way back when stick-ball was the game to play and they remember the first person that had a TV on their block.  Marriages, children, career changes, life changes, and now grandchildren:  they have weathered them together through decades of friendship.

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Ed and Gene founded Oral Fluid Testing (OFT) Laboratories, LLC in 2007.  For ten years they ran a company that provided pulmonary testing and drug and alcohol screening for various companies.  The US Department of Transportation was one of their largest clients.  This niche market allowed them a gateway into building safer working environments.  Almost immediately, the team identified major challenges with the accuracy of the industry-standard urine test. First, the breadth of options for tests to be tampered with, thus skewing the tests’ results, were well-known and widely used.  A rapidly developing market was flooding health food and vitamin stores; drinks, powders, and shakes designed to assist donors in beating a test, in addition to many well-known tricks from experienced test-takers, was making accurate testing more difficult.  Second, the undignified nature of providing urine collection is embarrassing and opens the door to accusations of sexual harassment and embarrassment.</span></p>
<p>Blood draws are the second most common type of diagnostic test. They are painful, create medical waste, risk potential infections, and are overall inconvenient and costly.  Eventually oral fluid testing was introduced, and Ed and Gene diligently set to work designing a procedure to collect oral fluid samples with DOT standard collection procedures in order to ensure accuracy and security of the sample and paper work.  This process identified major challenges with the collection process and demonstrated saliva test results were even easier to manipulate. While collaborating with several laboratories, Ed and Gene had scientists compare a lab-based urine test with some of the saliva tests on the market. A surprisingly high number of the saliva tests were coming back as false negatives; the saliva test was being beat as well.  Gene and Ed couldn’t help but imagine there were better, easier options.</p>
<br/><p><b>Can it also reduce medical waste and therefore save landfill space, time and money? YES!</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Research and Science of the Test:</b></p>
<p>After 10 years and exhausting all their resources including pensions, mortgages, and contacts and resources of close family and friends, their hard work and dedication to research and clinical trials has paid off.  Oral Fluid Testing Laboratory LLC, has developed a pain-free screening test for lead and other heavy metals present in the body.  The first of many products (voting link for next research proj.) to come, Toxyscreen was designed to make it easy for concerned parents to check their children for lead and mercury poisoning, which cause learning disabilities and may be one of the leading causes of autism.  All information needed for proper collection and fast, easy test results is in the Oral Fluid Screening test kit delivered right to your door.</p>
<p>After conducting years of research with assistance from retired Navy Nurse Nancy Harms, the owner of Patriot Drug and DNA Inc., and consulting with medical experts from around the nation,  it was discovered that oral fluid is much more accurate than saliva and often surpasses urine test accuracy as well.</p>
<p>A double blind clinical trial was conducted at Emory University Children’s Hospital in conjunction with the Georgia Department of Human Resources, Atlanta, GA and University of Massachusetts, Boston.  More than 500 children between the ages of 6 months to 6 years were tested.  The research results, soon to be published in The Journal of Clinical Toxicology, show that oral fluid is in all cases more reliable than any saliva test and in fact is as reliable as a venous blood test, because blood plasma is being collected in the oral fluid.</p>
<p>Dr. Gardener, one of the authors of the study, presented our <a href=""http://www.oftlabs.com/images/clinical-trial-result-accuracy.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">“Non-Invasive Lead Testing Technology”</a> at the Center for Disease Control (CDC) National Conference in October 2009 and received much praise and support from the attendees.  The study demonstrated that by using OFT’s patented collection and testing procedures, the results comparing the non-invasive, painless oral swab procedure versus an invasive painful blood test were extremely accurate.</p>
<p>The blood plasma collected in the oral fluid can not only detect drugs but also heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury,  Cadmium, Zinc, Copper, Arsenic, and Chromium, poison, and almost anything else a standard blood test can find.  This includes recreational and prescription drugs, hormones, HGH, and maybe even different types of cancers--all with just an easy swab of the gum line.  (Link to voting for nexy proj.?)</p>
<p>On November 9, 2010, the U.S. Patent Office issued OFT Labs <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/OFTLABS/photos/a.134665229928321.22233.134653256596185/135834306478080/?type=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Patent #7829340</a>.  This patent clearly indicates that the results of the oral fluid testing procedures are as accurate as venous blood samples.  Using OFT’s patented collection and testing procedures, the results comparing the non-invasive painless test versus an invasive painful blood test were extremely accurate.</p>

<br/><p><b>Why did OFT Labs decide to start with heavy metals testing?</b></p>
<p>There is no way of escaping it; there is going to be a paradigm shift in medical testing, from blood to oral fluid for all screening and diagnostic testing for the future.  Gene and Ed are hoping to help usher in this change with heavy metal testing.  Why did they choose to start with lead testing?  Lead testing is a federally mandated test that children should receive annually.  Doctors and pediatricians are required to provide lead testing to Medicaid children under the Child Wellness Program (link to fed law).  Additionally, OSHA requires heavy metal testing for workers in fossil fuel power plants, oil refineries, trash-to-steam power plants, construction sites, and solid waste/recycling jobs.  Add to that the growing concern by the general public to ensure safety from environmental harm due to poor air, water, and food quality conditions. Each of these parties are currently subjected to intravenous blood testing, which is painful and has to be conducted by a doctor’s office or laboratory.  This is a golden opportunity to provide an easier option.</p>
<p>Toxyscreen is a painless, dignified way to meet these needs.  New Jersey alone spends 28 billion dollars a year on health and education problems for residents affected by lead poisoning.  ""This is not just an inner-city problem but a suburban problem not yet realized"". Millions could be saved if Toxyscreen was used for early detection and mapping problem areas.  Construction companies, schools, and businesses that test new employees or do random testing could also save money on collection fees and time saved in doing the test on site by a trained professional.  Doctors can conduct collection right in their office.  If a person does test positive, immediate treatment can begin.</p>
<p>This test is easy, economical, efficient, and environmentally friendly.  Oral fluid-based testing techniques can be implemented for all testing from heavy metals, abused drugs both illegal and prescribed, (HGH) Human Growth Hormones, and medical screening.  This is why we need your support.</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">This testing is also for your four-legged friend/family member. Lead poisoning is a common source of accidental poisoning in pets, mainly puppies. If you have a pet that is diagnosed with lead poisoning, chances are that you may have been exposed as well.  The potential sources of lead for domestic animals are numerous and widespread. Ingestion of lead-based paints is the most commonly identified source of lead in poisoned cats and dogs. Other lead sources are toys, improperly glazed ceramic water or food bowls, contaminated tap water, and children's chalk.  Prior to the introduction of oral fluid testing, diagnosis of lead toxicity always involved a traumatic blood test.</span><br/></p>
<br/><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>Benefits of TOXYScreen:</b></span><br/></p>
<p>Toxyscreen is a home kit to test lead and heavy metals screening test for you, your family, and even your pets.  It is pain-free, fast, efficient, and accurate.  No risk of infection, anemia, thrombosis.  No fear, no scheduling hassles.</p>
<br/><p>During the study, Toxyscreen samples for the oral fluid test were sometimes collected from a sleeping child who was then taken into an exam room for the comparison blood test, awoken with a needlestick, crying from fright and pain. Some had to be held down by the parents or additional staff.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The testing is painless. No fear and anxiety of a blood draw. </p></li>
<li><p>A licensed phlebotomist is not needed because individuals or internal personnel, trained to collect samples, easily conduct the test without the risk of being exposed to bloodborne hazard.</p></li>
<li><p>No risk of infection, anemia, or thrombosis for the donor.</p></li>
<li><p>Personnel can be tested by your company Safety Director with exceptional benefits and cost savings. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Oral fluid specimen collection is quick and easy. An experienced, trained collector could collect up to 20 specimens per hour.</span></p></li>
<li><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The testing is private.  All samples are sent to OFT Laboratories to be analyzed.  Results are confirmed via an ICP/MASS SPEC technology.</span></p></li>
<li><p>There is no medical waste.  Oral fluid is not considered a biohazard, thus disposal costs are substantially reduced. The test kit is environmentally friendly and its plastic container can easily be recycled.</p></li>
<li><p>Samples do not require special handling or preservatives. Once oral fluid is collected, it does not have to be refrigerated. This is an advantage if collecting in remote areas such as third world countries. Testing can be performed anywhere in the world.</p></li>
<li><p>The testing is inexpensive. The at-cost value of the test is equivalent to a blood test.  It would not be an additional financial burden to provide the test if it was covered by insurance companies.</p></li>
<li><p>Sizable direct savings result from reduced donor wait time. There is no need to coax children into subjecting themselves to a finger stick to collect a capillary blood specimen. There is no need to travel to a doctor or lab with an elderly relative or individual with disability.  </p></li>
<li><p>The test can be completed in your own home or at your place of business/work.</p></li>
<li><p>Not much equipment is required, making this test a viable option for providing testing in third world countries.</p></li>
</ul>
<br/><h2>Use of Funds</h2>
<p>Ed and Gene believe in the technology they have discovered, and their mission and goal is the development of analytical techniques and instruments for identification and measurements of chemicals in biological and non-biological matrices.  By providing easy collection and accurate measurements of a wide range of organic and inorganic substances, OFT hopes to become the international standard and resource center for those industries requiring compliance testing, surveillance and monitoring testing.</p>

<h1><b>Testing Yourself, Your Family</b></h1>
<p>You can test your family’s levels of four toxic heavy metals – lead, arsenic, mercury and cadmium. Heavy metals are potentially deadly elements that can cause a host of health problems. Often heavy metal poisoning is misdiagnosed, and patients may not receive the correct treatment.</p>
<p>· Common exposures to arsenic include pesticides/fungicides/insecticides, beer, table salt, tap water, paints, cosmetics, treated wood, and food.</p>
<p>· Common exposures to cadmium include cigarettes, food, large fish and shellfish, tap water, auto exhaust, and air pollution from incineration.</p>
<p>· Common exposures to lead include tap water, cigarette smoke, hair dyes, paints, inks, glazes, some golf balls, fishing weights, battery manufacture, pesticide residue, and food.</p>
<p>· Common exposure to mercury include dental amalgams, large fish and shellfish, medications and vaccines, air pollution, chlorine, adhesives, fabric softeners, manufacture of paper, and waxes.</p>

<br/><h1>Testing Your Pets</h1>This testing is also for your four-legged friend/family member.</div>
<p>Lead poisoning is a common source of accidental poisoning in pets, mainly puppies. Many animals are lead poisoned every week! If you have a pet that is diagnosed with lead poisoning, chances are that you may have been exposed as well. Unlike the dramatic onset of clinical signs seen with most small animal poisonings, lead poisoning often has an insidious onset.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1317998/files/20150323071153-patriot.jpg?1427119913"" src="""" style=""width: 175.341px;height: 190px;""/></p>
<p>The potential sources of lead for domestic animals are numerous and widespread. Ingestion of lead-based paints is the most commonly identified source of lead in poisoned cats and dogs. Renovations of older houses involving sanding or scraping lead based paint is believed to be the major origin of the lead based paint in these instances. Other lead sources are toys, improperly glazed ceramic water or food bowls, contaminated tap water, and children's chalk.</p>
<p>The clinical signs of lead toxicity in dogs include convulsions or fits, vomiting and diarrhea, abdominal pain and bizarre behavior such as hysteria. Lead poisoning is more commonly diagnosed in younger dogs because they are more likely to chew on objects. However, adult dogs may also be affected. In contrast, lead poisoning in cats often only causes loss of appetite and signs such as fits are uncommon. Vomiting and diarrhea occur occasionally.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1335819/files/20150329070349-sophy_picture_testing.jpg?1427637829"" src="""" style=""width: 238.666666666667px;height: 179px;""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>Prior to the introduction of oral fluid testing, diagnosis of lead toxicity always involved a traumatic blood test. The diagnosis is sometimes difficult and two different tests may be required to confirm that lead poisoning is present, particularly in cats.

""Revolutionizing Testing""
A PARADIGM SHIFT IN MEDICAL TESTING                         NO BLOOD TEST




A double blind clinical trial was conducted at Emory University Children’s Hospital in conjunction with the Georgia Department of Human Resources, Atlanta, GA and University of Massachusetts, Boston.  More than 500 children between the ages of 6 months to 6 years were tested.  The research results, soon to be published in The Journal of Clinical Toxicology, show that oral fluid is in all cases more reliable than any saliva test and in fact is as reliable as a venous blood test, because blood plasma is being collected in the oral fluid.

Dr. S Lynn Gardener, one of the authors of the study, presented our “Non-Invasive Lead Testing Technology” at the Center for Disease Control (CDC) National Conference in October 2009 and received much praise and support from the attendees.  The study demonstrated that by using OFT’s patented collection and testing procedures, the results comparing the non-invasive, painless oral swab procedure versus an invasive painful blood test were extremely accurate.
The new screening test kit “Toxyscreen”, a product of OFT Labs, is designed to make it easy for concerned parents to test their children. All information needed for proper collection and fast, easy test results is in the Oral Fluid Screening test kit delivered right to your door.
The blood plasma collected in the oral fluid can not only detect drugs but also heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury,  Cadmium, Aluminum, Arsenic, Zinc Copper and Chromium, poison, and almost anything else a standard blood test can find.  This includes recreational and prescription drugs, hormones, HGH, and maybe even different types of cancers--all with just an easy swab of the gum line.

                                            TOXYSCREEN TEST KIT

After years of research and clinical trials Oral Fluid Testing Laboratory LLC, has developed a new PAIN-FREE screening test for lead and other heavy metals present in the body.
The new screening test kit “Toxyscreen”, a product of OFT Labs, is designed to make it easy for concerned parents to test their children. All information needed for proper collection and fast, easy test results is in the Oral Fluid Screening test kit delivered right to your door.



Toxyscreen is an oral
fluid testing method that allows the public access to cutting edge heavy
metal testing using oral fluids. The test is a simple swab that looks like a
q-tip rubbed along the gumline of your inner mouth. As a screening tool for lead and heavy metals “Toxyscreen” kit is the best, fastest and most reliable way for parents, parent groups working with lead-poisoned children, and parents of special-needs children concerned with mercury contamination, to test and screen their children.
After conducting years of research with assistance from retired Navy Nurse Nancy Harms, the owner of Patriot Drug and DNA Inc., and consulting with medical experts from around the nation,  it was discovered that oral fluid is much more accurate than saliva and often surpasses urine test accuracy as well.
The testing is
painless. No fear and anxiety of a blood draw. No scheduling hassles. No
pain from a needle. No risk of infection, anemia, thrombosis. Toxyscreen makes
testing easy, fast, and painless, especially for kids, the elderly, and pets.
The testing is
private. You order a test kit online, mail the sample back, and receive
results via mail and /or email. The test is completed in your own home.

The testing generates
no medical waste. Oral fluid is not considered medical waste, is not a bio-hazard, and produces no risk of blood borne pathogens.

                     


                        NO MEDICAL WASTE
What can I learn from
testing with Toxyscreen? 
This enormous, patented discovery identified by sheer persistence to find an option for more dignified testing, would eliminate the need to draw blood to detect overexposure to lead and heavy metals.  You can now test your family’s and pet’s levels of four toxic heavy metals: lead, arsenic, mercury and cadmium. Heavy metals are potentially deadly elements that can cause a host of health problems. Often heavy metal poisoning is misdiagnosed, and patients may not receive the correct treatment.  Lead tests in particular often go undone because the hazard of lead poisoning are unknown though fairly common, and parents don’t want the challenge and anxiety of a blood draw.
   
How does it work? We send you a kit, which includes detailed instructions and pictures regarding how to take the test. You take a sample (painless, easy, simple) and you mail it back. We send you the results by mail and/or email.


Your Privacy is very important to us: Your Privacy is protected by de-identifying the samples on receipt, sending you your unique bar-code, and performing all downstream data analyses only with that bar-code. All information is handled under HIPAA compliance program. We will not store your personally identifying information in any database or release it on the internet in any way, but we will take all reasonable precautions to avoid inadvertent identification of participants. Transfer of materials to other sites is covered by code access agreements. If you have any questions, please email us at  customerservice@toxyscreen.com Who should participate? Anyone can participate, but Toxyscreen particularly benefits children;, elderly patients who have a hard time getting out to a lab for a blood draw, struggle with clotting or finding a good vein for intravenous draws;, and anyone who is fearful of a needle.
                               


We are looking for contributors who believe in our product and can help us bring it to market. Your pledged funds will be used to expand the types of testing we do.
There is going to be a paradigm shift in medical testing in the future, from blood to Oral Fluid. We want you to be a part of that.

Blood draws are the second most common type of diagnostic test. They are painful, create medical waste, risk potential infections, and are overall inconvenient and costly.

OUR STORY
Meet Ed and Gene, the founders of OFT Labs and creators of a revolutionary testing method that will nullify the need for blood draws for heavy metal testing, replacing it with an oral fluid swab test.
These two South Jersey natives have been best friends since Kindergarten.  That’s right, they knew each other way back when stick-ball was the game to play and they remember the first person that had a TV on their block.  Marriages, children, career changes, life changes, and now grandchildren:  they have weathered them together through decades of friendship. Learn more about our story and roots!





Company History:  

Where did this concept of testing with Dignity come from?
Ed and Gene founded Oral Fluid Testing (OFT) Laboratories, LLC in 2007.  For ten years they ran a company that provided pulmonary testing and drug and alcohol screening for various companies.  The US Department of Transportation was one of their largest clients.  This niche market allowed them a gateway into building safer working environments.  Almost immediately, the team identified major challenges with the accuracy of the industry-standard urine test. First, the breadth of options for tests to be tampered with, thus skewing the tests’ results, were well-known and widely used.  A rapidly developing market was flooding health food and vitamin stores; drinks, powders, and shakes designed to assist donors in beating a test, in addition to many well-known tricks from experienced test-takers, was making accurate testing more difficult.  Second, the undignified nature of providing urine collection is embarrassing and opens the door to accusations of sexual harassment and embarrassment.
Blood draws are the second most common type of diagnostic test. They are painful, create medical waste, risk potential infections, and are overall inconvenient and costly.  Eventually oral fluid testing was introduced, and Ed and Gene diligently set to work designing a procedure to collect oral fluid samples with DOT standard collection procedures in order to ensure accuracy and security of the sample and paper work.  This process identified major challenges with the collection process and demonstrated saliva test results were even easier to manipulate. While collaborating with several laboratories, Ed and Gene had scientists compare a lab-based urine test with some of the saliva tests on the market. A surprisingly high number of the saliva tests were coming back as false negatives; the saliva test was being beat as well.  Gene and Ed couldn’t help but imagine there were better, easier options.
Can it also reduce medical waste and therefore save landfill space, time and money? YES!

Research and Science of the Test:
After 10 years and exhausting all their resources including pensions, mortgages, and contacts and resources of close family and friends, their hard work and dedication to research and clinical trials has paid off.  Oral Fluid Testing Laboratory LLC, has developed a pain-free screening test for lead and other heavy metals present in the body.  The first of many products (voting link for next research proj.) to come, Toxyscreen was designed to make it easy for concerned parents to check their children for lead and mercury poisoning, which cause learning disabilities and may be one of the leading causes of autism.  All information needed for proper collection and fast, easy test results is in the Oral Fluid Screening test kit delivered right to your door.
After conducting years of research with assistance from retired Navy Nurse Nancy Harms, the owner of Patriot Drug and DNA Inc., and consulting with medical experts from around the nation,  it was discovered that oral fluid is much more accurate than saliva and often surpasses urine test accuracy as well.
A double blind clinical trial was conducted at Emory University Children’s Hospital in conjunction with the Georgia Department of Human Resources, Atlanta, GA and University of Massachusetts, Boston.  More than 500 children between the ages of 6 months to 6 years were tested.  The research results, soon to be published in The Journal of Clinical Toxicology, show that oral fluid is in all cases more reliable than any saliva test and in fact is as reliable as a venous blood test, because blood plasma is being collected in the oral fluid.

On November 9, 2010, the U.S. Patent Office issued OFT Labs Patent #7829340.  This patent clearly indicates that the results of the oral fluid testing procedures are as accurate as venous blood samples.  Using OFT’s patented collection and testing procedures, the results comparing the non-invasive painless test versus an invasive painful blood test were extremely accurate.

Why did OFT Labs decide to start with heavy metals testing?
There is no way of escaping it; there is going to be a paradigm shift in medical testing, from blood to oral fluid for all screening and diagnostic testing for the future.  Gene and Ed are hoping to help usher in this change with heavy metal testing.  Why did they choose to start with lead testing?  Lead testing is a federally mandated test that children should receive annually.  Doctors and pediatricians are required to provide lead testing to Medicaid children under the Child Wellness Program (link to fed law).  Additionally, OSHA requires heavy metal testing for workers in fossil fuel power plants, oil refineries, trash-to-steam power plants, construction sites, and solid waste/recycling jobs.  Add to that the growing concern by the general public to ensure safety from environmental harm due to poor air, water, and food quality conditions. Each of these parties are currently subjected to intravenous blood testing, which is painful and has to be conducted by a doctor’s office or laboratory.  This is a golden opportunity to provide an easier option.
Toxyscreen is a painless, dignified way to meet these needs.  New Jersey alone spends 28 billion dollars a year on health and education problems for residents affected by lead poisoning.  ""This is not just an inner-city problem but a suburban problem not yet realized"". Millions could be saved if Toxyscreen was used for early detection and mapping problem areas.  Construction companies, schools, and businesses that test new employees or do random testing could also save money on collection fees and time saved in doing the test on site by a trained professional.  Doctors can conduct collection right in their office.  If a person does test positive, immediate treatment can begin.
This test is easy, economical, efficient, and environmentally friendly.  Oral fluid-based testing techniques can be implemented for all testing from heavy metals, abused drugs both illegal and prescribed, (HGH) Human Growth Hormones, and medical screening.  This is why we need your support.

Common sources and effects of heavy metals are detailed in
the chart below, provided by Occupational Safety and Health Association (OSHA).







Pets are included! 
This testing is also for your four-legged friend/family member. Lead poisoning is a common source of accidental poisoning in pets, mainly puppies. If you have a pet that is diagnosed with lead poisoning, chances are that you may have been exposed as well.  The potential sources of lead for domestic animals are numerous and widespread. Ingestion of lead-based paints is the most commonly identified source of lead in poisoned cats and dogs. Other lead sources are toys, improperly glazed ceramic water or food bowls, contaminated tap water, and children's chalk.  Prior to the introduction of oral fluid testing, diagnosis of lead toxicity always involved a traumatic blood test.
Benefits of TOXYScreen:
Toxyscreen is a home kit to test lead and heavy metals screening test for you, your family, and even your pets.  It is pain-free, fast, efficient, and accurate.  No risk of infection, anemia, thrombosis.  No fear, no scheduling hassles.
During the study, Toxyscreen samples for the oral fluid test were sometimes collected from a sleeping child who was then taken into an exam room for the comparison blood test, awoken with a needlestick, crying from fright and pain. Some had to be held down by the parents or additional staff.

The testing is painless. No fear and anxiety of a blood draw. 
A licensed phlebotomist is not needed because individuals or internal personnel, trained to collect samples, easily conduct the test without the risk of being exposed to bloodborne hazard.
No risk of infection, anemia, or thrombosis for the donor.
Personnel can be tested by your company Safety Director with exceptional benefits and cost savings. Oral fluid specimen collection is quick and easy. An experienced, trained collector could collect up to 20 specimens per hour.
The testing is private.  All samples are sent to OFT Laboratories to be analyzed.  Results are confirmed via an ICP/MASS SPEC technology.
There is no medical waste.  Oral fluid is not considered a biohazard, thus disposal costs are substantially reduced. The test kit is environmentally friendly and its plastic container can easily be recycled.
Samples do not require special handling or preservatives. Once oral fluid is collected, it does not have to be refrigerated. This is an advantage if collecting in remote areas such as third world countries. Testing can be performed anywhere in the world.
The testing is inexpensive. The at-cost value of the test is equivalent to a blood test.  It would not be an additional financial burden to provide the test if it was covered by insurance companies.
Sizable direct savings result from reduced donor wait time. There is no need to coax children into subjecting themselves to a finger stick to collect a capillary blood specimen. There is no need to travel to a doctor or lab with an elderly relative or individual with disability.  
The test can be completed in your own home or at your place of business/work.
Not much equipment is required, making this test a viable option for providing testing in third world countries.

Use of Funds
Ed and Gene believe in the technology they have discovered, and their mission and goal is the development of analytical techniques and instruments for identification and measurements of chemicals in biological and non-biological matrices.  By providing easy collection and accurate measurements of a wide range of organic and inorganic substances, OFT hopes to become the international standard and resource center for those industries requiring compliance testing, surveillance and monitoring testing.



Hopefully, you are inspired by the opportunities oral fluid testing has already proven to hold, and you will choose to be part of this paradigm shift in medical testing.  Your pledged funds will be used to integrate OFT’s heavy metals test into the current market and expand oral fluid testing beyond heavy metals. Our highest priority, with your support, is to seek Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Clinical laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) approval, which would allow doctors to offer the test to patients and would begin the process of obtaining approval for coverage by insurance companies. OFT has hundreds of possible markets for expansion, including medical offices, independent labs, schools, day care, airlines, the hospitality industry, sport facility , military personnel, MEDICAID recipients, manufacturing/processing facility, power plant  or construction sites and employers who drug test.  With further clinical trials, they hope to expand oral fluid metals testing to other heavy metals, steroid testing in sports, drug testing in fatal accidents, and examining its potential for identifying different types of cancers..   
This requires research, time, paperwork, and promotion of the test. With enough funding, licensing can provide onsite, or at minimal, regional testing facilities in order to increase efficiency of test to provide quicker results.  We will also have to address debt and expenses acquired from obtaining the patent, printing, marketing, Toxyscreen packaging, and initial work with University lab to provide testing and internal research.

Your pledge funds will also be used to:

manufacture the kits to collect your sample, analyze the results (includes purchasing reagents (primers, buffers, enzymes) for sequencing, running the equipment, performing bioinformatics and statistical analysis)
Website design and development
Hiring key Management and outstanding lab personnel.
Additional clinical trials
Research and development capital for supplies, additional lab equipment and training in order to expand into other states.
FDA approval (costs include lawyer fees for communicating with FDA, travel, and promotion funds)

We are looking for contributors who believe in our product and can help us bring it to market.  By choosing to donate, you will be part of a fundamental change in the way testing is conducted.  The potential is clear - painless, accurate oral fluid testing for heavy metals is on the horizon, and you can be part of ushering in this change.  These funds will help families identify lead poisoning early, avoiding long term medical problems, and will allow companies to provide easy, safe, effective testing to their employees, ensuring their health and safety.  The benefits are boundless.  Thank you for your consideration.

Testing Yourself, Your Family
You can test your family’s levels of four toxic heavy metals – lead, arsenic, mercury and cadmium. Heavy metals are potentially deadly elements that can cause a host of health problems. Often heavy metal poisoning is misdiagnosed, and patients may not receive the correct treatment.
· Common exposures to arsenic include pesticides/fungicides/insecticides, beer, table salt, tap water, paints, cosmetics, treated wood, and food.
· Common exposures to cadmium include cigarettes, food, large fish and shellfish, tap water, auto exhaust, and air pollution from incineration.
· Common exposures to lead include tap water, cigarette smoke, hair dyes, paints, inks, glazes, some golf balls, fishing weights, battery manufacture, pesticide residue, and food.
· Common exposure to mercury include dental amalgams, large fish and shellfish, medications and vaccines, air pollution, chlorine, adhesives, fabric softeners, manufacture of paper, and waxes.


How to collect a specimen:



Take swab from kit, break seal at red cap and carefully. 


Remove swab from sterile protective tube. Swab must not be touch or placed on any surface.


Place swab in well of the mouth between the lower teeth lip rotate and rub swab front to back both sides for a 60 second count of the lower lip.

Place swab back into Sterile protective tube than, remove 
seal from requisition form and apply seal over the TOP of swab.

Place sealed swab into self address shipping envelope or box with 
completed requisition form. 
Testing Your PetsThis testing is also for your four-legged friend/family member.
Lead poisoning is a common source of accidental poisoning in pets, mainly puppies. Many animals are lead poisoned every week! If you have a pet that is diagnosed with lead poisoning, chances are that you may have been exposed as well. Unlike the dramatic onset of clinical signs seen with most small animal poisonings, lead poisoning often has an insidious onset.

The potential sources of lead for domestic animals are numerous and widespread. Ingestion of lead-based paints is the most commonly identified source of lead in poisoned cats and dogs. Renovations of older houses involving sanding or scraping lead based paint is believed to be the major origin of the lead based paint in these instances. Other lead sources are toys, improperly glazed ceramic water or food bowls, contaminated tap water, and children's chalk.
The clinical signs of lead toxicity in dogs include convulsions or fits, vomiting and diarrhea, abdominal pain and bizarre behavior such as hysteria. Lead poisoning is more commonly diagnosed in younger dogs because they are more likely to chew on objects. However, adult dogs may also be affected. In contrast, lead poisoning in cats often only causes loss of appetite and signs such as fits are uncommon. Vomiting and diarrhea occur occasionally.

Prior to the introduction of oral fluid testing, diagnosis of lead toxicity always involved a traumatic blood test. The diagnosis is sometimes difficult and two different tests may be required to confirm that lead poisoning is present, particularly in cats. More Clinical Studies are required to prove the accuracy of our test for Felines.

Benefits of Oral Fluid Testing Versus Blood Testing



Oral fluid testing is much easier, more cost effective, and much less painful (in fact it's not painful!) than other testing methods in use today:

Third party collection fees are eliminated by using personnel on our staff that are trained to collect samples.  There are no blood-borne hazards to technicians or collectors. 

A licensed phlebotomist is not needed. No risk of infection, anemia or thrombosis. 


Oral fluid is not considered a bio-hazard, thus disposal costs are substantially reduced. The test kit is environmentally friendly and its plastic container can easily be recycled. There is no medical waste.


Samples do not require special handling or preservatives. Once oral fluid is collected, it does not have to be refrigerated. This is an advantage if collecting in remote areas such as third world countries. Testing can be performed anywhere in the world.


Sizable direct savings result from reduced donor wait time. There is no need to coax children into subjecting themselves to a finger stick to collect a capillary blood specimen. There is no need to travel to a doctor or lab with an elderly relative or individual with disability.


Oral fluid specimen collection is quick and easy. An experienced, trained collector could collect up to 20 specimens per hour–a little less than 3 minutes per donor!


All samples are sent (via overnight mail) to OFT Laboratories to be analyzed.  Results are confirmed via an ICP/MASS SPEC technology.  Time is saved not only in the specimen collection process, but also in the results turnaround time. Test results are completed and returned electronically within 10 days.

Risks & Challenges  People value your transparency. Be open and stand out by providing insight into the risks and obstacles you may face on the way to achieving your goal.  Risk:  Training new hires on smoothie prep
Risk:  Balancing and receiving fresh inventory
Risk:  Location placement
What qualifies my wife and I to overcome these hurdles is that we are constantly faced with small business challenges every day from the 250 other successful small businesses we've started.  I plan to be there, side-by-side with the new hires to ensure the quality and training is excellent.  I plan on creating a customer account with Sysco food deliveries to ensure we get fresh and ready fruits and vegetables all year.  Lastly, I am working with the local Albertson's grocery store to secure a location on a busy road in plain view for maximum visibility for the drive-thru.    Other Ways You Can Help   If you are unable to give, you can still help by getting the word out on social media and telling your friends!   You can use the Indiegogo tools to help spread the word about tasty and healthy smoothies coming to a city near you.",0.0,1,"1 Campaign

</p><p>Imagine being a doctor
but not able to help patients. That
is Dr. Jedida Maube’s plight. Dr. Jedida Maube always dreamed of becoming a
doctor, since childhood she was fascinated by the men and women in pure white
coats, she would say, ‘I want to be a doctor and keep everyone alive.’ She was
always top of my class and was very good at sciences. When we finished high
school, she went to MOI UNIVERISTY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE where she pursued her
bachelors degree in medicine.</p>
<p>She began living her dream
2 years ago when she joined VIHIGA DISTRICT HOSPITAL as a resident doctor. Jedida was glad to work and give back to the
local community in Vihiga after the support she received from her community in
pursuit of her medical dream. However, she cannot do what she loves doing best.
</p>
<p>Six months ago, Jedida
was diagnosed with Cancer of the colon. She has been undergoing chemotherapy at
ST.LUKES HOSPITAL &amp; THE MOI TEACHING &amp; REFERRAL HOSPITAL in ELDORET,
KENYA. Unfortunately, she is not responding well to treatment and has thus been
referred to India for further treatment at a cost of Ksh.2.5MILLION which is
about 27,700 USD.</p>
<p>Jedida’s FAMILY, THE
BUTERE GIRLS’ HIGH SCHOOL ALUMNI &amp; THE KENYA MEDICAL PHARMACISTS &amp;
DENTISTS UNION have started a campaign to support Jedida receive the medical
treatment she needs in India. We cannot do this alone hence need the help of
all well wishers. With your contribution, we can send Jedida to India where she
can received the specialized treatment. Her medical cover and family financial
support has been covering her medical expenses in Kenya, However, her medical
cover has been exhausted and her family is unable to financially support her. This
why we ask you her crowd to help raise money to support her medical treatment
in India. </p>
<p>Jedida is a strong lady,
at only 30 years, she is often the one encouraging her visitors when they come
to see her. For most of us, it is heart breaking to see her so fragile and with
that wig on her head, she had this beautiful thick black hair. ’Come on, don’t
look sad, this is only temporary, I will soon be back on my feet to attend to my
patients’ she says. Her determination is evident as she had enrolled for her
Masters degree, MBChB at MOI UNIVERSITY which she struggles with despite her medical condition.</p><p> Please let us help Jedida help other
patients by supporting her medical appeal. For 500USD donations and about, you
will receive an African painting, a #teamJedida polo Tshirt and a band. For 200
USD donation you get a #teamJedida polo T-shirt, a band and a pair of African(Maasai)

you get a Tshirt, a band and an African neck piece. All who help towards this

<p>The reason to turn to you is the adventure we started 3 years ago- the aim to create the first in the world Ecofriendly Park for extreme water sports fully able to be dismantled. Meet project “Magicable”. This will be the first wakeboard park in Bulgaria, as well as the only sports center of its kind in this area of the world. Located across an area of a 14 000 m<sup>2 </sup>will be 2 wakeboard cables, 14 cabins, fully situated on top of the water, cloakroom, changing room, restaurant, shop, relax zone, camping zone, a study hall for lectures and seminars as well as a stage for events out in the open.</p>
<p>As you can see this is a very ambitious project in which we are putting all our efforts, energy and knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>The place now: </strong></p>
<div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505398711/mo9ikbwt9kgvbd4yhlqc.jpg"" src=""""/></div>

<div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505398906/zoafqrrpna9gxi3llghu.jpg"" src=""""/></div>
<p>In a chart below you may see a detailed description of our costs so far. We already have the place, where we have invested money in cleaning and reconstruction, as well as a preliminary contract for the construction of two cable for wake board at this location. For the latest installment of the first system - 2.0, we need your help !</p>
<p>These money equal 1/3 form the money we need in order to open its doors next season and to start the next step in building the park- to create the infrastructure around the place.The most interesting is that the project will combine sports, outdoor activities and events in an unusual way for the country.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505388598/y0hkfvt5jz0rwohvagsa.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>With the realization of this project we will greatly improve the tourism in the area of Pravets. At the same time the artificial lake is located 70 km away on the highway from Sofia which makes it incredibly convenient to reach from the airport of the capital as well as from most big cities of Bulgaria.</p>
<p><u><strong>Calendar and next steps;</strong></u></p>
<p>With your help, the park will be able to start next season ( 2018) . We have developed a vision for the project in the future. Detail in steps :</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505388561/zmcon6ntqmu88r3nt4tw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why help us?</h3>
<p>Because the artificial lake „Osikovica” and the area around it need somebody to take care of them. WE are here to do this.</p>
<p>Because we will create a place at which you can practice a new and fun sport out in the open , while breathing fresh air and having fun.</p>
<p>Because you love sport and you believe everyone should be more active in order to live a happy life.</p>
<p>Because we need this sport center in order to develop the region and to make a lot of people very happy.</p>
<p>Because you have never been to Bulgaria and the park will be one more awesome reason to come.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>So.....We will build park like this one! ( check the video below) </u></strong></p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/a-7i5_NWD-U?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> We believe than every journey starts with one single step and we have already made that magical step. With your help we can make the next step in the project – putting the two cables for wakeboard.</p>
<p>If we manage to gather 100 %  of the money we will be able to build a two-point cable for wakeboarding, which will be suitable for beginners and we can start organizing training camps for kids.</p>
<p>If we gather 50 % of the money we will make the second payment for the construction of a big cable and we can apply for additional funding.</p>
<p>If we gather more then 25 % of the money we will start building the cabins as well as the other buildings for the park: restaurant, shop, camping site, cloakroom and changing rooms.</p>

</div></div>","Why we need your help?
The reason to turn to you is the adventure we started 3 years ago- the aim to create the first in the world Ecofriendly Park for extreme water sports fully able to be dismantled. Meet project “Magicable”. This will be the first wakeboard park in Bulgaria, as well as the only sports center of its kind in this area of the world. Located across an area of a 14 000 m2 will be 2 wakeboard cables, 14 cabins, fully situated on top of the water, cloakroom, changing room, restaurant, shop, relax zone, camping zone, a study hall for lectures and seminars as well as a stage for events out in the open.
As you can see this is a very ambitious project in which we are putting all our efforts, energy and knowledge.
The place now: 

 

In a chart below you may see a detailed description of our costs so far. We already have the place, where we have invested money in cleaning and reconstruction, as well as a preliminary contract for the construction of two cable for wake board at this location. For the latest installment of the first system - 2.0, we need your help !
These money equal 1/3 form the money we need in order to open its doors next season and to start the next step in building the park- to create the infrastructure around the place.The most interesting is that the project will combine sports, outdoor activities and events in an unusual way for the country.

With the realization of this project we will greatly improve the tourism in the area of Pravets. At the same time the artificial lake is located 70 km away on the highway from Sofia which makes it incredibly convenient to reach from the airport of the capital as well as from most big cities of Bulgaria.
Calendar and next steps;
With your help, the park will be able to start next season ( 2018) . We have developed a vision for the project in the future. Detail in steps :


Why help us?
Because the artificial lake „Osikovica” and the area around it need somebody to take care of them. WE are here to do this.
Because we will create a place at which you can practice a new and fun sport out in the open , while breathing fresh air and having fun.
Because you love sport and you believe everyone should be more active in order to live a happy life.
Because we need this sport center in order to develop the region and to make a lot of people very happy.
Because you have never been to Bulgaria and the park will be one more awesome reason to come.
 
So.....We will build park like this one! ( check the video below) 

 

The Impact
 We believe than every journey starts with one single step and we have already made that magical step. With your help we can make the next step in the project – putting the two cables for wakeboard.
If we manage to gather 100 %  of the money we will be able to build a two-point cable for wakeboarding, which will be suitable for beginners and we can start organizing training camps for kids.
If we gather 50 % of the money we will make the second payment for the construction of a big cable and we can apply for additional funding.
If we gather more then 25 % of the money we will start building the cabins as well as the other buildings for the park: restaurant, shop, camping site, cloakroom and changing rooms.


Our values: 

We develop sport

We protect the environment

We support the development of tourism in the region



Why Bulgaria? 
We have all the 4 seasons! And each of them is incredibly beautiful. People love to smile, the food is delicious, the internet is fast and the prices are normal. What more do you need for a nice vacation?
Here you can find snowy mountains, dazzling beaches, and vast meadows perfect for a stroll or even golf, mineral springs, amazing waterfalls and astonishing lakes. As well as many archeological sites, monasteries, completely preserved old cities and historical ruins, also here we have incredibly colorful music, dances and rituals. Here you can get away from your home and feel at home at the same time. To relax, to have fun and to learn something new.
