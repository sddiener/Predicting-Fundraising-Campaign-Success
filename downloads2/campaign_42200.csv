<p><b>Our Story</b></p>
<p>We started Brazilia because we wanted to change the fashion world by creating a swimwear brand for smart, witty, creative women who aren’t afraid to speak their minds.  Too often women are criticized for everything they do from trying to be a good mother and housewife to trying to be a good boss.  We thought it was time to turn the tables around!  We wanted to create a brand that celebrates women and reflects our values:  excellent quality, elegant appeal, and enthusiasm to make the world a better place.</p>
<br/><p><b>Why Brazilia?</b></p>
<p>First, we asked ourselves:  Can we create <b>premium quality</b> swimwear that’s <b>comfortable</b>, <b>sustainable</b>, <b>uniquely-designed</b>, AND <b>sexy</b>?<br/><br/><b>The answer is a resounding YES!</b><br/>1. Premium Quality means using the softest nylon, spandex, and lace we can find.</p>
<p>2. Comfortable meaning your new Brazilia swimsuit will stay put, even when you go surfing or do yoga!</p>
<p>3. Sustainable means each Brazilia swimsuit was made with love by a single mother or female head-of-household.  Brazilia aims to empower women that currently provide financial support for their families, and to help restore their sense of dignity and purpose instead of that all-too-familiar feeling of helplessness. Of course, we do try to source the best eco-friendly materials too!</p>
<p>4. Uniquely-designed means we partner with awesome artists to create unique prints and add unexpected details to our products like continuously-customizable features and quotes on the inside of our non-reversible garments (we will make reversible ones in the near future!).</p>
<p>5. Sexy means exactly that, sexy!  We all know that we can get all of the above, but at the sacrifice of looking and feeling sexy.  Now, we don’t have to give that up!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b><b>Brazilia Does Good</b></b></p>
<p>Next, we asked ourselves:  How can we build a brand that does good?  To us, that means two things:  doing good for the women who buy our products and doing good for the entire world.</p>
<p>First, we decided that every woman deserves to smile.  So, we put quotes inside our swimsuits!  That’s right, quotes!  Think of it as our sexy little secret, OK?</p>
<p>Then, we decided we wanted to change women’s lives for the better.  Through our program, Swimwear For Hope, Brazilia trains and employs single mothers to sew.  All of our garments are made by women who are single mothers or female heads-of-households.  So, with every Brazilia purchase your make, you’re contributing to giving a single mother a job.</p>
<br/><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>That’s great, but what else?</b></p>
<p>We believe in giving back to the community.  10% of profits from every swimsuit purchase will support a charitable cause listed at the bottom of this campaign.  We ask that you pick a cause that you’re passionate about, let us know what it is, and 10% of that sale goes to that cause.  Simple as that!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Our Swimwear</b></p>
<p>Our Signature Bikinis and Monokinis include y<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">our choice of 12 colors and 9 design options:</span></p>
<p>3 designs of bikini tops ~ halter, sliding triangle, or twisted bandeau</p>
<p>3 designs of waistbands ~ extra wide, sliding side ties, or sliding double</p>
<p>3 designs of bottoms ~ bikini, Brazilian, or thong</p>
<p>MIX ‘N MATCH OUR BIKINI TOPS AND BOTTOMS TO YOUR HEART’S DESIRE!</p>
<p>2 designs of monokinis ~ scrunchy halter or V-neck with cutout sides</p>
<p>Our monokinis also come with bottom choices (bikini, Brazilian, or thong).</p>
<p>Current available sizes:  S, M, L.  If we can raise enough funds, we want to expand to include XS and XL, which will be available at a later date.</p>

<p>Good question!  We’ve spent the last 12 months working to develop our product, brand, technology, and supply chain.  We now need to raise capital to turn our ideas into a successful business, and crowdfunding gives us an amazing platform to achieve that quickly while sharing our passion with our family and friends.  Any money raised through this campaign can be used exactly where we need it - to expand our available sizes, and to get the website and supply chain to the level we need to deliver our brand promise.  We are all ready to go (0 to 60mph) full-speed ahead with all of these as soon as we raise the funds. IndieGogo is about allowing your friends and family to see, share, and engage in your idea, and then pledge support by buying PERKS.  There’s something for everyone, and every pledge of support gets something in return along with our eternal gratitude.</p>

Don’t worry!  We’ll be in touch at the end of the campaign to sort it all out.

Can I change my shipping address if I move?
Yes, we’ll reach out to everyone 30 days prior to shipping your swimsuit to confirm your address and make any necessary changes.  Please message us if your email changes as we’ll be using that to contact you.
When will my PERK be delivered?
We will send out gift certificates immediately at the end of the campaign so that they are with you in time for the beginning of summer.  All of the swimsuits will be delivered by the end of June.
Why is delivery not the normal 3 weeks?
Delivery is longer than the normal proposed length as these are our first production orders.
If I want to buy something, what do I do?
Click on the PERK that you want and choose to pay for that perk or give a donation.  You can then pay with PayPal or a credit card.  Please be sure to give us your correct shipping address.  Once approved, you will get an automatic email from IndieGogo confirming your purchase.  We will update you on our progress throughout the campaign, and at the end of the campaign, we will send you a link where you can order your swimsuit online.
Why are you using IndieGogo and not just launching your website?
Good question!  We’ve spent the last 12 months working to develop our product, brand, technology, and supply chain.  We now need to raise capital to turn our ideas into a successful business, and crowdfunding gives us an amazing platform to achieve that quickly while sharing our passion with our family and friends.  Any money raised through this campaign can be used exactly where we need it - to expand our available sizes, and to get the website and supply chain to the level we need to deliver our brand promise.  We are all ready to go (0 to 60mph) full-speed ahead with all of these as soon as we raise the funds. IndieGogo is about allowing your friends and family to see, share, and engage in your idea, and then pledge support by buying PERKS.  There’s something for everyone, and every pledge of support gets something in return along with our eternal gratitude.
Is this your website?
No, this is our IndieGogo campaign page.  Our website is www.BraziliaSwim.com, and we will “go live” when our campaign finishes.  However, until then please spread the word about us using the IndieGogo Share Tools.  Thank you!

Is airfare and hotel included with the Official Fashion Catalog Shoot PERK?

<p>""What makes a classic, a classic ?"" </p>
<p>Hello Guys !</p>
<p>We created The Proper Sneaker ™  because we couldn't find beautiful, minimal, inspiring, white sneakers, in natural leather of high quality under 400$. We saw the beauty of a simple solution and our answer was to create our own minimal white sneaker, a proper sneaker that we could treasure and sell at a fair price, no matter what, —one that isn't inflated by expensive showroom, storefronts, middlemen, or excessive marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>Thus, we want to be different building an honest relationship with you, going against the status quo, and offering high quality, minimal sneakers with the lowest possible markups.</p>
<p>The Proper Sneaker ™ is a brand built upon an awareness of a new kind of consumer—the kind of person who cares where his coffee and meat come from, as much as his clothes and sneakers. Uniformity, quality, efficiency and individuality are the words at the heart of each creative process. We believe that our consumer doesn’t necessarily wants to look like a walking billboard or doesn’t need any superfluous ornamentation or logos to assert his or her identity.</p>
<p>At The Proper Headquarters , Simplicity is the key.</p>
<p>Our inspirations come from Art, Architecture, and the rebellious minds in today’s corporate world. There is a difference between ""Simple"" and ""Basic"" and we make sure to separate both for our customers. The Proper Sneaker ™ is simple but not basic.</p>
<p>We choose the name ""Proper"" because of it's definition – ""Genuine"" in English (US), Correct in British –. We believe in minimalism, efficiency and simplicity. The Proper Way means minimal and clean lines, proper natural leather, properly constructed, properly stitched with no visible branding and above all, no luxury markup.  ✔</p>
<p>Now we need your help and support to spread the word to bring this project to life !</p>

Hello Guys !
We created The Proper Sneaker ™  because we couldn't find beautiful, minimal, inspiring, white sneakers, in natural leather of high quality under 400$. We saw the beauty of a simple solution and our answer was to create our own minimal white sneaker, a proper sneaker that we could treasure and sell at a fair price, no matter what, —one that isn't inflated by expensive showroom, storefronts, middlemen, or excessive marketing campaigns.
Thus, we want to be different building an honest relationship with you, going against the status quo, and offering high quality, minimal sneakers with the lowest possible markups.
The Proper Sneaker ™ is a brand built upon an awareness of a new kind of consumer—the kind of person who cares where his coffee and meat come from, as much as his clothes and sneakers. Uniformity, quality, efficiency and individuality are the words at the heart of each creative process. We believe that our consumer doesn’t necessarily wants to look like a walking billboard or doesn’t need any superfluous ornamentation or logos to assert his or her identity.
At The Proper Headquarters , Simplicity is the key.
Our inspirations come from Art, Architecture, and the rebellious minds in today’s corporate world. There is a difference between ""Simple"" and ""Basic"" and we make sure to separate both for our customers. The Proper Sneaker ™ is simple but not basic.
We choose the name ""Proper"" because of it's definition – ""Genuine"" in English (US), Correct in British –. We believe in minimalism, efficiency and simplicity. The Proper Way means minimal and clean lines, proper natural leather, properly constructed, properly stitched with no visible branding and above all, no luxury markup.  ✔
Now we need your help and support to spread the word to bring this project to life !
The Proper Team.

<p>My inspiration for the Bloodstone Cross came when I was doing research for my brothers birthstone. The bloodstone, also known as the heliothorpe, is the March birthstone. I went back to find the origin of the Bloodstone, which goes back over two thousand years. Since the middle ages a Christian belief claims that the“Bloodstone” was formed at the base of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, when the blood of his wounds fell onto the dark green earth and turned ordinary stone into Bloodstone. </p>

<p>In these times of unprecedented global natural disasters, the threat of war, mass murdering of innocent people, starvation and disease. I feel that it is essential and there is no better time that we get closer to God. We must shed our sins to do so. We do that by embracing the blood of Jesus. It is my purpose to have people be proud to embrace His blood every day by touching the Bloodstone Cross, wearing it, talking about it and being proud of this precious symbol of faith. </p>

<p><strong>Our Quality and Production</strong></p>
<p>There are no two bloodstones alike.</p>
<p>The genuine bloodstones are sourced and mined in different parts of the world. A Gemologist selects each stone that exhibits the best quality/color and size. The stones get packed and labeled and shipped to our factory in Qingdao China where they are then cut to our exact specifications and then polished and then placed carefully in their settings. The last step before shipping to the US or around the globe is quality control inspection.  </p>
<p><strong>Our Philosophy</strong></p>
<p>​To Make Your Body and Spirit Happy. Start At The Core. Your Faith.</p>
<p><b>Proof of Business Viability</b></p>
<p>In a nutshell; We did a 3 week ""proof of concept” test on Facebook, spending $20 a day using video ads. We targeted the obvious custom audiences and geo targeted 5 states (Georgia, Kentucky Tennessee, Mississippi, Missouri). The ad was served to 52,000 Facebook users and the video had over 20,000 views, 2.500 likes/loves and 293 people shared it with friends and family. Bloodstone Cross (on Facebook) had close to 300 positive and beautiful comments/conversations.  I received comments and emails with wonderful thoughts and prayers. Getting this kind of reaction with a total ad budget of $420 proved that the Bloodstone Cross is an item that people are passionate about, something they desire and would want to possess.</p>
<p>However, although I had a lot of click-throughs to the site many abandoned the shopping cart when they started shopping. It was the 8 weeks delivery that stoped them in their tracks. In an age of “next day shipping” having no inventory is a real problem. </p>
<p><strong>We Need Your Pledge</strong></p>
<p>To make this project a reality and offer you the best of the best, we have a contract with a solid manufacturing partner but have come as far as we can on our own. Now, we would love your support so we can:</p>
<p>• Meet minimum order requirements by our manufacturer to take this from prototype to reality! </p>
<p>• Scale up production  in order to get cost down. We want for that the Bloodstone Cross be  affordable so everyone can own this symbol of faith.</p>
<p>• Spread the word through social media marketing campaign</p>

</div><p>And that's all there is to it.</p></div>","My inspiration for the Bloodstone Cross came when I was doing research for my brothers birthstone. The bloodstone, also known as the heliothorpe, is the March birthstone. I went back to find the origin of the Bloodstone, which goes back over two thousand years. Since the middle ages a Christian belief claims that the“Bloodstone” was formed at the base of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, when the blood of his wounds fell onto the dark green earth and turned ordinary stone into Bloodstone. 
This, to me, was a profound discovery. Which lead me to combine the two of the most fundamental symbols of Christianity, the sacred blood of Jesus and the Cross it self.

In these times of unprecedented global natural disasters, the threat of war, mass murdering of innocent people, starvation and disease. I feel that it is essential and there is no better time that we get closer to God. We must shed our sins to do so. We do that by embracing the blood of Jesus. It is my purpose to have people be proud to embrace His blood every day by touching the Bloodstone Cross, wearing it, talking about it and being proud of this precious symbol of faith. 

Our Quality and Production
There are no two bloodstones alike.
The genuine bloodstones are sourced and mined in different parts of the world. A Gemologist selects each stone that exhibits the best quality/color and size. The stones get packed and labeled and shipped to our factory in Qingdao China where they are then cut to our exact specifications and then polished and then placed carefully in their settings. The last step before shipping to the US or around the globe is quality control inspection.  
Our Philosophy
​To Make Your Body and Spirit Happy. Start At The Core. Your Faith.

Getting this kind of reaction with a total ad budget of $420 proved that the Bloodstone Cross is an item that people are passionate about, something they desire and would want to possess.
However, although I had a lot of click-throughs to the site many abandoned the shopping cart when they started shopping. It was the 8 weeks delivery that stoped them in their tracks. In an age of “next day shipping” having no inventory is a real problem. 
We Need Your Pledge
To make this project a reality and offer you the best of the best, we have a contract with a solid manufacturing partner but have come as far as we can on our own. Now, we would love your support so we can:
• Meet minimum order requirements by our manufacturer to take this from prototype to reality! 
• Scale up production  in order to get cost down. We want for that the Bloodstone Cross be  affordable so everyone can own this symbol of faith.
• Spread the word through social media marketing campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>To be an awesome dad doesn't mean you have to do away with style right? My name is Miles, and I'm the founder of Rich Dad Society, a company created to keep dads looking cool! However, it's not just for dads. This brand has been great for coaches, teachers, mentors, and positive male role models alike! Sure, we use apparel as the vessel, but we're more that.  Rich Dad Society was created as a way to build a community; men who share stories, give advice, and generally just a group who enjoy shooting the S***!  </p>
<p>It's pretty clear that men don't have the same options when it comes to parenthood apparel. My goal is to change that! Fatherhood is a role that should be celebrated, and I'll gladly play its host. Providing apparel that looks awesome is a must. If it feels amazing, great. If you could combine those with a message of brotherhood, you'v e got yourself a real winner!! That's what  <a href=""http://www.richdadsociety.com/shop/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Rich Dad Society</a> is; a company that make you feel like you're a part of something bigger than yourself.  The company tagline, ""Continue To Inspire"" speaks to that directly! Our current inventory includes T-shirts, Dri-balanced polo shirts, custom business and performance socks. We're hoping to add more items this fall; including our first subscription box!!</p>
<p>With your contribution, our company can introduce new items to our continuously growing community (that's a lot of C's), and allow us to keep our prices affordable! Lets be honest, diapers aren't cheap :)</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
<p>We are hoping to raise <i><strong>$35,000.00</strong></i>. This money will help us complete quite a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marketing services that help spread the mission and vision of our company; Graphic Designer, Updated website, various marketing campaigns via social media platforms</li>
<li>Expanding our inventory for the next several collections (Fall, Winter, Spring, Summer)</li>
<li>Creating exclusive items for our subscription box </li>
<li>Cover the cost for numerous trade shows &amp; festivals for 2018 &amp; 2019</li>
</ul>
<p>We're currently creating <strong>EXCLUSIVE</strong> items for those who make a donation. These will not be available anywhere else as a special thank you for believing in what we're doing! We've teamed up with an amazing graphic designer who has created some awesome pieces for her clients; including our community service day apparel! We're lucky to have her on board for this campaign. </p>
<p>Our perks range from ""Great Dad I"" to ""Super Dad"" and with each upgrade the perks just get better and better. Starting with the exclusive T-shirt, and ending with you actually <i><strong>CREATING</strong></i> one of the designs for our collection. We really want you know that you're helping launch something that will have a lasting impact on not just our local community, but whatever community you live in as well. This has the potential to go world wide!! Our perks include shirts, tumblrs, sock subscriptions, and more!</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, that's okay too! <strong>We'll donate 20% </strong>of what we earn to a local organization in the Kansas City, MO area! The rest will go towards adding additional inventory to our company.</p>

<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>Supporting this campaign is more than just supporting an apparel brand. Rich Dad Society was created to build a sense of pride for an otherwise under-recognized group. Fathers often get overlooked in their role because of how awesome moms are! We wanted to create something that Fathers, and the women who represent them would want to be a part of. After becoming a father, that phrase, ""It takes a village"" had a whole new meaning!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>""What if I'm not a dad?"" </strong></i></p>

We're building a community that kids can go to for help, and since our inception, the response has been absolutely wonderful! The message is our driving force; ""Continue To Inspire"" our clothes just happen to feel great!</p>
</div><div><h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2></div><div>
<p>There's a ton of apparel brands out there, and we're not naive to that. In our first year of business, we found ourselves trying to compete, instead of focusing on our message.

We want those who buy our items to feel like, ""I am a great dad"" or ""I know someone who is a great dad"". We were able to recognize our error pretty early, and make the necessary changes. It's all about being able to adjust.</p>
<p>We'll continue to work hard at spreading the word of Fatherhood, and positive role models. We'll always live by our motto, ""Continue To Inspire"" because you know never know who that'll affect. </p>

</div><div>
<p>You love the idea, but you're being fiscally responsible? That's completely understandable! A simple share goes further than you could possible imagine!</p>

<p></p><br/><br/></div>","This is BOOKER, a high-fashion contemporary collection based in New York City. Conceived in 2012 by me, Jameelah Booker, BOOKER aims to be the high-fashion brand that expresses a woman’s personal power through timeless, sleek design and wearable function. Through design, BOOKER wants to inspire your unique edge…and set it free.

Why now? BOOKER was inspired by the passion that motorcycle culture ignites in my life. A marriage of what I love to do and what I love to wear. Now, BOOKER is proudly growing into a new phase. On the heels of growing industry buzz, I’m looking to expand.
BOOKER from a brand that offers only jackets and pants to a full ready to wear collection, unleashing the wild side in every woman. Clean lines, a timeless color palette, and a versatile modern fit that make women feel confident and free. 
The inspiration for my collection are real-life women I’ve met along my journey. I call them “The Wild Ones.” Transformed by their passions and raw ambitions, these girls have conquered and thrived in their own “jungle” of personal challenges and growth.

Locally Manufactured. I believe in the importance of locally sourced manufacturing in order to have complete control in the production and quality of each collection, and to oversee the precise details of each jacket made. Because of this, the price point may be higher, but the quality is that of the meticulously crafted vintage jackets of yesterday.
Quality leather jackets, hand crafted with the finest materials. I use the best available cow, deer, and lamb skins the market has to offer, and hand pick every skin to make sure my customer is getting the highest grade of leather. These are premium jackets that will get better with age.

<p>Alysia
Thomas London, founded by photographer and film producer Alysia Thomas in 2014,
is a slow fashion brand specializing in scarves, pocket squares and handkerchiefs that are finely printed digitally, in Britain and Italy. </p>While luxury and quality is essential, the need to adopt environmentally-friendly practices is at the heart of the company. <div>
<br/><div>Working with family run factories, printers and mills Alysia Thomas London is dedicated to producing the finest quality printed fabrics in limited print runs. </div>

<p><b>THE COLLECTIONS  </b></p>
<p>Based on a striking series of original photographs, Alysia Thomas London’s first collection of finely printed scarves, pocket squares, and handkerchiefs has been curated from travels across Europe, life in sun-kissed California, and a home base in London. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>SQUARES COLLECTION</b></p>
<p>With Alysia Thomas London, I wanted to add some fun and color to the men's accessories market. Most items available are the same old polka dots and stripes. Boring! I wanted to give men something fun to accessorize with. What makes our squares so unique is the ability to match multiple colors.  Each square has an endless color pallet, allowing men to match numerous tie and shirt combinations with one single square.</p>

THE STORY

Alysia
Thomas London, founded by photographer and film producer Alysia Thomas in 2014,
is a slow fashion brand specializing in scarves, pocket squares and handkerchiefs that are finely printed digitally, in Britain and Italy. While luxury and quality is essential, the need to adopt environmentally-friendly practices is at the heart of the company. 
Working with family run factories, printers and mills Alysia Thomas London is dedicated to producing the finest quality printed fabrics in limited print runs. 


Alysia Thomas London creates sumptuous accessories that brighten any outfit and last a lifetime.











THE COLLECTIONS  
Based on a striking series of original photographs, Alysia Thomas London’s first collection of finely printed scarves, pocket squares, and handkerchiefs has been curated from travels across Europe, life in sun-kissed California, and a home base in London. 


SQUARES COLLECTION
With Alysia Thomas London, I wanted to add some fun and color to the men's accessories market. Most items available are the same old polka dots and stripes. Boring! I wanted to give men something fun to accessorize with. What makes our squares so unique is the ability to match multiple colors.  Each square has an endless color pallet, allowing men to match numerous tie and shirt combinations with one single square.

<div>Hows it going everyone. My name is Jared Harrison-Jackson. For a long time now, I have been a big fan of an indie game that's been recently growing in popularity called Skullgirls. I found myself designing hoodies that incorporated aspects of certain characters just because I thought it was fun. I didn't really think much of it until I had a good number of people praise it and express a great deal of interest in either modeling them if they were ever developed and an equal amount just saying they wanted to have it. That being in mind, I thought to seriously consider turning these designs into a reality. Thus here we are, at the start of this journey. As a contributor you would be helping turn this idea into a true option for fans of this game all over. A new way to express their fandom. </div> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<div>This project is going to undoubtedly create its share of problems. The main one being that there aren't any decent silk screening services, online or otherwise, that can allow for the amount or manner of customization I would need to produce these designs in reality. After doing some research I've determined that in order to make this a reality and overcome this obstacle, I'll need to do this personally with my own silk screening mechanism, which requires me to purchase one. Per the research I've done a mechanism of high enough quality to create the quality and quantity I want to make a pristine product will cost nearly $500. I project I will cost nearly another $400 for the materials necessary to produce the initial first line such as the blank hoodies and silk screening materials. Even if the full funding goal isn't met by the deadline, whatever IS raised will be used to continue the pursuit of the final result. And all support will still be appreciated.</div>
<div>And of course your support will definitely be appreciated in more than just a thank you if possible. There are unique perks I plan on offering as a thank you. Exclusive opportunities and chances to obtain the finished works before anyone else being examples. </div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I feel this project has value a few different ways. The main one being that it gives a unique and as far as my research has told me currently non-existent way for this specific fandom to be represented. It also shows that you don't have to be a professional fashion designer or sponsored gamer to create something popular and interesting. Hopefully if the project is successful, in fact even if it isn't it'll inspire others to create. This is admittedly my first major project I am attempting to put into practice. However I have a distinct idea in mind and a plan to see it through.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>As previously stated the main hurdle to overcome is production. There arent any real silk-screening companies that allow for the level of customization to match my designs and the ideas that they are based on. With that in mind I'll need to do it myself with my own silk-screening press. If the proper funding isnt acquired then I will overcome that hurdle by using what funding I can manage and getting a cheaper press or implementing a less expensive method of silk-screening. This will cause for a longer production time to create the same quality product but at least the final product will still be assured. </div>

<p>My name is Kim Kheradmandi, but no one except myself on the internet calls me Kimbo Gruff. </p>
<p>I'm a British/Persian visual artist, designer and the more attractive male counterpart of Kim Kardashian. I'm currently based in Berlin, I moved here last year after spending 1460 days in the lovely city of Amsterdam. </p>
<p>I work in many different mediums including drawing, painting, collage and photography, you can check my work <a href=""http://kimbogruff.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://kimbogruff.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>
<p>I'm here to plead, I mean pledge, I mean to ask you to pledge, whatever you can afford (if you like the project) to help me get my new clothing label, GRUFF, off the ground</p>

<p></p>
<h3>When Did GRUFF Start And Why Kimbo Gruff?</h3>
<p>Kimbo Gruff is my artist alias for reasons I won't go in to, it's not a traumatic story, it's just a bit dull. GRUFF started as I've had the idea of creating a small T-shirt label for a while and I thought my current artist alias lent itself nicely to the branding of the label. I've been working on the current format of my t-shirt aspirations for a few months now and feel I have a solid product to launch in to the world.</p>
<p>I've always enjoyed simple, visually striking t-shirts over busy bright shirts with pop culture references or cringey phrases, particulary shirts that say BABE in glitter or such like, although I am a babe, obviously. </p>
<p>I would love to create my own line of shirts with simple, bold designs and a high print and garment quality. I have already realised a very small run of one design (pictured below on my body) and would like to continue to get the rest of my ideas out there and develop the label further,eventually producing sweatshirts, hoodies etc.<br/></p>

</div>
</div></div>","OH HI! I Wasn't Expecting You, I Was Just Enjoying The 2014 Edition Of The Simpsons Annual, What's That? Who The Hell Are You?
My name is Kim Kheradmandi, but no one except myself on the internet calls me Kimbo Gruff. 
I'm a British/Persian visual artist, designer and the more attractive male counterpart of Kim Kardashian. I'm currently based in Berlin, I moved here last year after spending 1460 days in the lovely city of Amsterdam. 
I work in many different mediums including drawing, painting, collage and photography, you can check my work here.
I'm here to plead, I mean pledge, I mean to ask you to pledge, whatever you can afford (if you like the project) to help me get my new clothing label, GRUFF, off the ground




The Gruff Logo


When Did GRUFF Start And Why Kimbo Gruff?
Kimbo Gruff is my artist alias for reasons I won't go in to, it's not a traumatic story, it's just a bit dull. GRUFF started as I've had the idea of creating a small T-shirt label for a while and I thought my current artist alias lent itself nicely to the branding of the label. I've been working on the current format of my t-shirt aspirations for a few months now and feel I have a solid product to launch in to the world.
I've always enjoyed simple, visually striking t-shirts over busy bright shirts with pop culture references or cringey phrases, particulary shirts that say BABE in glitter or such like, although I am a babe, obviously. 
I would love to create my own line of shirts with simple, bold designs and a high print and garment quality. I have already realised a very small run of one design (pictured below on my body) and would like to continue to get the rest of my ideas out there and develop the label further,eventually producing sweatshirts, hoodies etc.










Where IS GRUFF now?I'm in a very good position to get this project off the ground as soon as I receive the funding boost I need! I have a tried and tested printer ready to supply the goods and of course the designs are all there, six designs in total which you can see here:

Why I Need Your Help?
Cos I'm currently living in a barrel, not really, don't be silly! I just decided to sit in a barrel for a perfectly normal reason, I definitely didn't forget to put on any jeans that day.


Basically, I'm reaching out for your help as I would like to get all my designs out there and give people some options on which GRUFF shirt they would like to sport. In the future I would also like to expand the label in to producing things like sweatshirts and hoodies etc.



Where Your Generosity Will Go
 

To produce the actual shirts first and foremost, including a super sweet logo printed on the outer back collar of the shirt itself


All six designs will be produced and ready to buy


We will be printing on high quality organic fabrics 

I'll be organising some photo shoots to create some wonderful content for the online presence of GRUFF
General promotion & marketing


If we don't reach our entire goal, I will still invest all of the money raised in to helping this project along as best I can.




What You Get
I won't go in to all the details about the rewards here of course but needless to say I've got some nice things lined up for all you beautiful peoples, including shirts, digital art prints and original artwork!








The Printers 

As I said, I have a tried and tested print company already lined up to print my t-shirts, they're a small screen printing company based in the Kreuzberg district of Berlin. The small run of shirts I already got from these guys was perfect.  


The Print Technique
The print technique we will be using is water-based silk screen printing, here's why:

It is better for the environment as there are fewer chemical nasties involved
It gives a much nicer feel to the shirt as the ink goes directly in to the fabric; rather than having the feeling that some one stuck some plastic on your shirt, as so often happens

The longevity of the design is also very good with this type of printing



The Shirts
The model of shirts I will be using are a super soft 100% organic cotton t-shirt from Stanley Stella. Check here for more info about the companies sustainability policies.



    Risks & Challenges
 The risks and obstacles for this project are very minimal as I have already had a sample of the product and am confident with the guys I've got to deliver the goods. 
As long as the project is fully, or partly, funded I will be able to go ahead, place the orders and have all or some of the shirts ready to go.

Forecasting Risks
If all goes well during our funding campaign, we'll finish up with a giant heap of preorders and have many new ""qboxer's"" join the experience.  Of course we are trying to predict our future demand and plan accordingly, but it's far from an exact science.  While we have prepared for a large influx of members, it could be slightly off our initial calculations.

<h4>The
Journey</h4>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>As
a psychic and crystal healer, one difficulty was obtaining stones and<br/>
carrying them on our person for their properties and attributes.
</b><br/>
-Jewelry is widely used, but finding the combinations needed is often difficult<br/>
-People often spent way beyond their budget on mismatched pieces.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Native
American studies and training utilized a great solution<br/>for PART of the problem, the Medicine Bag.</b><br/><span>-Several
stones of choice can fit into the bag and be worn around the neck.<br/>
-The pouch was paintable, and could be customized with symbols.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>However…</b><span><br/>-Leather,
like silk and plastic, seals stone energy from releasing<br/>frequencies into the
aura.<br/>
-The style did not go well with much other than very casual dress.<br/>
<br/>
<span>It was a long
journey that brought forth</span></span><br/>the exquisite
stones and metals for this line… <br/>conceived from
my paintings, dreams, meditations &amp; journeys.<br/>
The collection was created with fluidity and movement<br/>Full of light, life and energy.<br/>To see my
visions come to life I decided only Jewelry would convey my story.<br/>My first
collection, “The Sacred
Feminine”,<br/>was birthed
from my Grandmother’s best friend’s broken
Rosary and<br/>my beautiful
friend who inspired my collection, Terri Riha. <br/>It was a long journey that brought forth<br/>the powerful
stones and metals for this line.

Phoenix Fyr Collections is launching with the <br/>Limited Editions of ‘The

Enhancers’.<br/>
This collection springs from a combination of many skills and a<br/>lifetime
journey into the sacred.<br/>
This is the realization of a dream that began in childhood, making jewelry at
my grandmother's kitchen table, almost 50 years ago.</p>

</p>
<h4>How Phoenix Fyr got
started<br/>
</h4>
<p>
<b>In 2012, I was reunited with Terri Riha; and in 2013 I flew to Arizona to meet
with her again in person. She is a marketing specialist</b>, but I had gone down to teach some classes she had set up for me with some
groups down there, but she also wanted to review my portfolio. I did not
include my jewelry designs in this<br/>because my pieces were one of a kind, and I rarely
even took pictures of what was essentially someone else's sacred piece. <br/><br/><b>As usual, I was wearing a personal
piece, my Egyptian Menat, which I created as a solution to a streamlined,
elegant Medicine Bag.</b> She fell in love with it, and I told her it was a one of a kind, one of my
pieces. Terri insisted I start creating jewelry again, tossed a piece of cloth on
her kitchen counter, and started taking pictures and making phone calls. She was
right, everything was almost perfect. I had the paintings for the symbolism in my portfolio, and the Menat. I knew what was needed for the Amulet, with
dozens of different stone combinations. </p>
<p>
<b>Terri Riha sent my Egyptian Menat to a
major brand name marketing company representative, telling me that she was going to put my jewelry out “on the market”.</b></p>
<b>
</b><p><b>
2 weeks later I received a call.</b></p>
<p>
Terri said her contact is very interested my design, that the company wants to
see my jewelry ‘sets’. This particular company was actually actively looking for a designer of more 'spiritual' jewelry, created by one who
understood and could produce all the stone, cultural, and spiritual
information.<span>  I laughed,and said, “I don’t have any SETS of jewelry right now”. She replied, “Well,
pull out your portfolio and put something together in Power Point. You have 2
weeks.”</span></p>
<span>I am a shaman, and an artist, so I went through my paintings, and pulled out 5
of my favorite paintings to start creating the first 2 sets.</span>
<p><span>
Within that 2 week period, I did the
renderings and completed a PowerPoint presentation, with my information on the
attributes of the imagery and stones as</span><span> well as with the proposed packaging. The representative was impressed, and I
was given a fulfillment list for September.</span>
</p>
<p><span></span></p>
<h4><span>
<span>The Divine Mother
Collection and <br/>Phoenix Wing Enhancer Collection were born.</span></span></h4>

<br/><span><span></span></span><p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>By
the end of May 2013, I had been in personal contact with the Buyers Rep, and
they had started making offers to me. I was also given a new fulfillment list
for the next meeting, in October,in person.
While doing the marketing and research reports as well as working on my
copyrights, I called my family connections that began clear back with my
Grandmother, to make the first sets of jewelry, and now…</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>A
single ‘Master Set’ of the jewelry was used in all the photos. Each piece
pictured is from that set: Menat Chain, White Onyx Pendulum, <br/>
Faceted Clear Quartz Pieces. The difference in color, has to do with the way
light travels through and is reflected and diffused <br/>
by the stones. Sometimes the pieces seem almost colorless, but in motion they
are alive with Color and Light!</p>

What Makes these Collections so Unique?<span></span>

SYNERGY

</h4>
<p>

The combined or connected
energy of these stones is wonderful and very powerful for bringing in a great
deal of light and bio-physical energy. It brings a great boost to the aura and one's personal vibration,
as well as grounding it into the Chakras, high to low, and the physical body.
Your personal energy increases, with even more available, as it draws guidance to you and brings
the psychic abilities you already have to your attention. In addition to this,
it initiates a different type of protection: one that turns negative and unwanted foreign energies
sent forward moving into a higher vibration, rather than deflecting negativity
off you towards others. It also helps Empaths recognize what is not their own! A great booster for those highly spiritual, and gently
effective for those new to the path.<span>  </span><br/><i>GoldenHawk

<h4>-SILVER- </h4>“Reflection,
Psychic Influence &amp; Inner Awareness” Identified with the Eternal Mother
Hat-Hor, said to bestow deep inner reflection, a natural connection to<p>Divine Timing, and life cycles. Like a tidal sea of energy it attracts,
absorbs, deflects, &amp; dissolves. Being non-magnetic it stimulates release of
that which no longer<br/>
serves, often bringing awareness of deeply held blocks in all bodies, physical
as well as energetic. Protective &amp; healing to the psyche. When used in
settings or<br/>
stones, worn as jewelry, it amplifies the stones attributes, releases the
energy into one’s aura &amp; syncs one with Divine timing.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4><span>-COPPER- </span></h4>
<p>A
‘fountain of youth’, the metal of Auset (Isis), the Queen of Heaven, said to
bestow her Divine Attributes on the wearer. Through the ages, claims have <br/>
been made in the use of copper to stop and even reverse signs of aging.
Nefertiti, Cleopatra &amp; the Queen of Sheba were said to use copper based
skin cream to retain <br/>
&amp; improve youth &amp; beauty. A conductor and bridge for energy between
individuals, bodies, space &amp; other minerals. Enhances the properties of all
stones &amp; crystals. Draws
out toxins, physical &amp; spiritual. For 1000s of years it has been used to treat
arthritis, parasites, gray hair, burns, bruising, pain &amp; swelling in
muscles &amp; joints, <br/>
viral and bacterial infections. Symptoms gradually decrease as elasticity,
flexibility &amp; synaptic response improve. Now known to be an essential
micro-nutrient, needed for blood, protein metabolism, cell formation, production of RNA, enzyme activity,
hair and skin color, and nerve health. <br/>Used as an active ingredient in expensive
skin treatments.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>-RHODIUM- </h4>
<p>Associated
with the Egyptian Goddess Nieth, ‘The Weaver’, ‘Womb of Light ‘Used in ancient
civilizations for magical and alchemical properties long before its re-discovery in the 1800’s. Wearing
jewelry with Rhodium brings a complex &amp; catalytic connection with the ‘Web
of Light’, focused on Ascension &amp; Restoration. Invokes power to change in a balanced, cohesive
&amp; Harmonized way by effecting the individual on all levels: body, mind
&amp; spirit. Connects with higher vibrations of personal and mass consciousness. Involved in: brain
&amp; gland function, cognition, IQ, emotional development, memory, thymus,
adrenal, hypothalamus, pineal balance, sleep regulation, restoration regeneration of tissue &amp; DNA, used to improve: deteriorating
cell tissue, mental attitude, hormonal, emotional, menstrual Balance. To
alleviate: headaches, twitching, irritability &amp; panic attacks. Rhodon means Rose, directly
associated with the Virgin Mary, Mary the Mother of God.</p>

<p>Her names are your names. She is daughter,
sister, mother, wife and partner, as well as she who walks alone. Many fold and
as multi-faceted as the stars in the Heavens. Virgin or whore, pauper or Queen, she is the balance, the missing piece that
brings wholeness into what has been a broken, chaotic, war torn and disposable
world. Symbol of life, abundance, healing, loving protection, peace and
personal-empowerment: the feminine face of God.
<br/><br/>At the age of about 4, I
began a life long journey into what is now called the ‘Sacred Feminine’. I
began with what was available, the Children’s Bible. Starting with stories of Mary, then Eve, I finally found Sarah, Rebecca, Deborah, Leah, and
Egypt. In Egypt, I found The Goddess.
Through history, legend,
music, mythology, poetry, ceremony, dance and art from many ancient cultures
around the world, I experienced the sacred female. </p>
<p>
Almost 45 years after beginning my journey, and with all of our new technology
and communications, the Divine Feminine has made herself known again. </p>
<p>
Through the ancient arts of design, painting, metal-smithing and stone cutting,
I am making her icons, legends, lore and symbolism readily available, constructed
with high quality metals and real semi-precious and precious stones made as my offering for the
goddess: You.  <br/><i>Angelia</i><br/></p>

</p>
<p>As
a child reading a history book, I can't remember the name of, I came across an
old spelling of the word, ‘fire’. Whether it was Celtic, Welsh, Viking, I can’t
remember, but <br/>
the meaning haunted me: fire from liquid or gas, “swamp fire”, spelled FYR. Then,
reading the legends of the Phoenix, how it sprung forth from the heart of an
Eternal God,<br/>
like the soul released into the heavens!
Later, after reading the stories of The Goddess Hathor, and her tears, being
the fluid seed for gods and men, I was inspired.<br/>
It lived in my subconscious, weaving
through almost everything I did. And now, expressed in metal and stone, my
representation of this process is combined<br/>
with ancient icons, based on earliest
legends, and imagery. <br/>I give you my dream, my vision. <br/><i>Angelia</i><br/></p>
<h4>
<span>TRANSFORMATION INTO THE
BENU BIRD</span> (the Phoenix)</h4>
<p>
</p>
<p>Up
out of primeval matter. I came into being like the god Khepera. I germinated
like the plants. I am concealed<span>  like the
tortoise [in his shell]. I am the seed of every god. I am Yesterday of the Four
[Quarters of the Earth, and] the Seven Uraei, who came into being in the
Eastern land. [I am] the Great One (Horus) who illumineth the Hememet spirits
with the light of his body. [I am] that god in respect of Set. [I am] Thoth who
[stood] between them (Horus and Set) as the judge on behalf of the Governor of
Sekhem and the Souls of Anu. [He was like] a stream between them. I have come.
I rise up on my throne. I am endowed with Khu. I am mighty. I am endowed with
godhood among the gods. I am Khensu, [the lord] of every kind of strength. He
shall see the  Disk [of the Sun], he
shall be in good case upon earth before Ra and His word shall be truth in the
sight of Osiris and no evil thing, what so ever, shall have dominion over him
for ever  and  ever.

<h4>The
PHOENIX<span>  Self
Created’ , ‘Lord of Jubilees ‘, ‘The Ascending One’</span>
</h4>
<p>
</p>
<p>“I
am the Bennu Bird, the Heart-Soul of RA, the Guide of the Gods through the
underworld” (Egyptian book f the Dead). To ‘Become the Phoenix’ is to ‘Rise
Brilliantly’ to ‘Shine’.<br/>
Legend is that the Phoenix burst forth
from the heart of Osiris during His Resurrection. RA is re-born through the
seeding of Light into Auset (Isis) creating the Horus line of<br/>
God-Kings, attaining Immortality through
awakening, burning to ashes the old and painful, as it rises into new life. Its
cry is the most beautiful song, giving the Sun pause as<br/>
its voice rises to the Heavens. Said to
always return to Egypt to rest upon The Ben Ben Stone in The Temple of the
Phoenix, considered one of the most sacred places on <br/>
Earth until The Stone was stolen, the temple defiled. A universal symbol of
free will, healing &amp; ascension spanning thousands of years, bridging time
&amp; cultures.</p>

designs. I called her brother, Tom, at Handley’s Rock and Jewelry and it became
very simple. Tom said he would be more than happy to custom cut my stones for
the jewelry and that he would make a few phone calls.<span>  Within hours of initial contact, he had
called their current metalsmith and arranged for me to meet with her. He also
contacted a wax maker for me. </span></span></p>

</p>
<p>At Handley’s
Rock and Jewelry store in Vancouver, I spoke with Arlene Handley, known for her
wall of personally hand-picked strands of stone beads and the information that
goes with them. She immediately began taking down beads, and pulling specialty
jewelers fittings/findings out for me. She shared expert advice, and said that
she’d help me throughout the process.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Then, I had
waxes fabricated. I was very unhappy with the machined waxes, and wanted
something better, but I had no idea who could hand cut waxes like Sherry did. I
decided, during our appointment, to ask Beth from Overcast Studio about my
situation. When I told her the machine pieces from my renderings were NOT going
to work out for me, she said she could HAND CARVE the waxes, make hand pressed
molds, and do the first jewelry with reclaimed silverware. She laughed and asked
what the family silver looked like. The costs went up at that point, but the Originals
had to be hand cut. Designer pieces from start to finish.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448523384/nxie2ydniyfcplog3ptw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Jo Diamond
came in as an investor at this point, making the next steps possible. Hand
carved waxes and hand-made molds are incredibly expensive, but it. I was
pleased that she agreed. She wanted the jewelry as much as Terri did. I signed
her on, and we waited for the completion, as the price of silver went up.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The waxes
and molds were coming close to completion, and I had chosen silver for the
metal for the first set for a multitude of reasons. Beth's comment about the
silverware drifted through my mind again, and a light bulb went off: Paul
Hamilton and Norbert Anderson, who I’d been working with for gems and minerals as
well as estate jewelry for my one of a kind Menats, for decades. I contacted
Paul and made an appointment. I told them my situation: I had no family silver,
and a limited budget for this. Norbert generously donated me a sum of cash and
Paul Hamilton started handing me mis-matched silverware by the fistfuls. Their
support was very important; They have been in the jewelry business since the
‘80’s.<span>  Norbert said ‘copyright, Copyright,
COPYRIGHT’. I told him I was on it!</span></p>

<p>
</p>
<p><span>On August 10th I had submitted 36
copyrights (with 117 derivatives). The process was intense, and even with the
background I had in jewelry making, this was a new and different world, I was
learning more as I went, while the silverware from Paul was steadily becoming
the first complete prototypes for Quality Control and my testers. Tom was hard
at work on more stones. </span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span>There was a great deal of market
research involved, and I was finalizing my 248 page document around the middle
of September. The gem suppliers I had been dealing with for over 20 years from India
and Bali were no longer at U.S. gem shows and the orders I had made were
arriving with the wrong stones, incorrect measurements and findings. A jewelry
designer friend of mine suggested a new stone supplier elsewhere, and made the connections
happen. The stones were fabulous! I went to work with this new company for the
test pieces. Between Handley’s Rock &amp; Jewelry, Overcast Studios, and this
new company, I had 12 sets of jewelry prototypes ready go through 18 months of
rigorous testing. I traveled in October for a personal meeting with the
marketing company representative. I turned over 3 sets of prototypes for
Quality Control, and learned there was interest from 3 additional Countries. I
also received a new fulfilment list. It was very in depth, but I had around a
year, because the jewelry had to be tested by people who would wear it, and the
production designs had to be tested also. I knew there would be changes coming.

Beauty,
energy and spiritual vibrations are all around us, so why not wear them?










The
Journey


As
a psychic and crystal healer, one difficulty was obtaining stones and
carrying them on our person for their properties and attributes.

-Jewelry is widely used, but finding the combinations needed is often difficult
-People often spent way beyond their budget on mismatched pieces.


Native
American studies and training utilized a great solutionfor PART of the problem, the Medicine Bag.-Several
stones of choice can fit into the bag and be worn around the neck.
-The pouch was paintable, and could be customized with symbols.


However…-Leather,
like silk and plastic, seals stone energy from releasingfrequencies into the
aura.
-The style did not go well with much other than very casual dress.

It was a long
journey that brought forththe exquisite
stones and metals for this line… conceived from
my paintings, dreams, meditations & journeys.
The collection was created with fluidity and movementFull of light, life and energy.To see my
visions come to life I decided only Jewelry would convey my story.My first
collection, “The Sacred
Feminine”,was birthed
from my Grandmother’s best friend’s broken
Rosary andmy beautiful
friend who inspired my collection, Terri Riha. It was a long journey that brought forththe powerful
stones and metals for this line.

Divine Mother’ and ‘Phoenix Wing

This collection springs from a combination of many skills and alifetime
journey into the sacred.
This is the realization of a dream that began in childhood, making jewelry at
my grandmother's kitchen table, almost 50 years ago.

How Phoenix Fyr got
started


In 2012, I was reunited with Terri Riha; and in 2013 I flew to Arizona to meet
with her again in person. She is a marketing specialist, but I had gone down to teach some classes she had set up for me with some
groups down there, but she also wanted to review my portfolio. I did not
include my jewelry designs in thisbecause my pieces were one of a kind, and I rarely
even took pictures of what was essentially someone else's sacred piece. As usual, I was wearing a personal
piece, my Egyptian Menat, which I created as a solution to a streamlined,
elegant Medicine Bag. She fell in love with it, and I told her it was a one of a kind, one of my
pieces. Terri insisted I start creating jewelry again, tossed a piece of cloth on
her kitchen counter, and started taking pictures and making phone calls. She was
right, everything was almost perfect. I had the paintings for the symbolism in my portfolio, and the Menat. I knew what was needed for the Amulet, with
dozens of different stone combinations. 

Terri Riha sent my Egyptian Menat to a
major brand name marketing company representative, telling me that she was going to put my jewelry out “on the market”.


2 weeks later I received a call.

Terri said her contact is very interested my design, that the company wants to
see my jewelry ‘sets’. This particular company was actually actively looking for a designer of more 'spiritual' jewelry, created by one who
understood and could produce all the stone, cultural, and spiritual
information.  I laughed,and said, “I don’t have any SETS of jewelry right now”. She replied, “Well,
pull out your portfolio and put something together in Power Point. You have 2
weeks.”
I am a shaman, and an artist, so I went through my paintings, and pulled out 5
of my favorite paintings to start creating the first 2 sets.

Within that 2 week period, I did the
renderings and completed a PowerPoint presentation, with my information on the
attributes of the imagery and stones as well as with the proposed packaging. The representative was impressed, and I
was given a fulfillment list for September.



The Divine Mother
Collection and Phoenix Wing Enhancer Collection were born.








By
the end of May 2013, I had been in personal contact with the Buyers Rep, and
they had started making offers to me. I was also given a new fulfillment list
for the next meeting, in October,in person.
While doing the marketing and research reports as well as working on my
copyrights, I called my family connections that began clear back with my
Grandmother, to make the first sets of jewelry, and now…


A
single ‘Master Set’ of the jewelry was used in all the photos. Each piece
pictured is from that set: Menat Chain, White Onyx Pendulum, 
Faceted Clear Quartz Pieces. The difference in color, has to do with the way
light travels through and is reflected and diffused 
by the stones. Sometimes the pieces seem almost colorless, but in motion they
are alive with Color and Light!


What Makes these Collections so Unique?


-Designs are so different
they have been awarded Copyrights-New perspective of the ancient
that speaks to our souls-Imagery aligns with the fire and strength of the Sacred Feminine-‘Medicine Bag’ streamlined, elegant and personalized-Amulet allows the
smallest stones and beads to be used-Energetically balanced through Icons as well as minerals-Pieces are interchangeable as life transitions occur-Separate velvet/suede
pouches for individual pieces-Unique 8 pocket pouch that also holds two cuffs-Pouches transport and protect pieces, and any other jewelry-Convenient scrolls put properties and attributes at your fingertips-The line is created as an art collectible.


Minerals chosen for their
values, attributes, and beauty.

Real Semi-Precious and Precious Stones, 











SYNERGY




The combined or connected
energy of these stones is wonderful and very powerful for bringing in a great
deal of light and bio-physical energy. It brings a great boost to the aura and one's personal vibration,
as well as grounding it into the Chakras, high to low, and the physical body.
Your personal energy increases, with even more available, as it draws guidance to you and brings
the psychic abilities you already have to your attention. In addition to this,
it initiates a different type of protection: one that turns negative and unwanted foreign energies
sent forward moving into a higher vibration, rather than deflecting negativity
off you towards others. It also helps Empaths recognize what is not their own! A great booster for those highly spiritual, and gently
effective for those new to the path.  GoldenHawk



What are the benefits of
wearing these minerals?



Metals held sacred through the Ages…


-SILVER- “Reflection,
Psychic Influence & Inner Awareness” Identified with the Eternal Mother
Hat-Hor, said to bestow deep inner reflection, a natural connection toDivine Timing, and life cycles. Like a tidal sea of energy it attracts,
absorbs, deflects, & dissolves. Being non-magnetic it stimulates release of
that which no longer
serves, often bringing awareness of deeply held blocks in all bodies, physical
as well as energetic. Protective & healing to the psyche. When used in
settings or
stones, worn as jewelry, it amplifies the stones attributes, releases the
energy into one’s aura & syncs one with Divine timing.


-COPPER- 
A
‘fountain of youth’, the metal of Auset (Isis), the Queen of Heaven, said to
bestow her Divine Attributes on the wearer. Through the ages, claims have 
been made in the use of copper to stop and even reverse signs of aging.
Nefertiti, Cleopatra & the Queen of Sheba were said to use copper based
skin cream to retain 
& improve youth & beauty. A conductor and bridge for energy between
individuals, bodies, space & other minerals. Enhances the properties of all
stones & crystals. Draws
out toxins, physical & spiritual. For 1000s of years it has been used to treat
arthritis, parasites, gray hair, burns, bruising, pain & swelling in
muscles & joints, 
viral and bacterial infections. Symptoms gradually decrease as elasticity,
flexibility & synaptic response improve. Now known to be an essential
micro-nutrient, needed for blood, protein metabolism, cell formation, production of RNA, enzyme activity,
hair and skin color, and nerve health. Used as an active ingredient in expensive
skin treatments.


-RHODIUM- 
Associated
with the Egyptian Goddess Nieth, ‘The Weaver’, ‘Womb of Light ‘Used in ancient
civilizations for magical and alchemical properties long before its re-discovery in the 1800’s. Wearing
jewelry with Rhodium brings a complex & catalytic connection with the ‘Web
of Light’, focused on Ascension & Restoration. Invokes power to change in a balanced, cohesive
& Harmonized way by effecting the individual on all levels: body, mind
& spirit. Connects with higher vibrations of personal and mass consciousness. Involved in: brain
& gland function, cognition, IQ, emotional development, memory, thymus,
adrenal, hypothalamus, pineal balance, sleep regulation, restoration regeneration of tissue & DNA, used to improve: deteriorating
cell tissue, mental attitude, hormonal, emotional, menstrual Balance. To
alleviate: headaches, twitching, irritability & panic attacks. Rhodon means Rose, directly
associated with the Virgin Mary, Mary the Mother of God.



The
DIVINE MOTHER







{on the left : Suspended in a drop of light, representing ‘The
Tear of Hathor’, released rom the Eye of 
RA , upon  Her return from which
came the Gods and Man}{on the right : Bursting free from the Duat, on a spray of
inspirational stars,
bringing color and light into a new dawn.}
Her names are your names. She is daughter,
sister, mother, wife and partner, as well as she who walks alone. Many fold and
as multi-faceted as the stars in the Heavens. Virgin or whore, pauper or Queen, she is the balance, the missing piece that
brings wholeness into what has been a broken, chaotic, war torn and disposable
world. Symbol of life, abundance, healing, loving protection, peace and
personal-empowerment: the feminine face of God.
At the age of about 4, I
began a life long journey into what is now called the ‘Sacred Feminine’. I
began with what was available, the Children’s Bible. Starting with stories of Mary, then Eve, I finally found Sarah, Rebecca, Deborah, Leah, and
Egypt. In Egypt, I found The Goddess.
Through history, legend,
music, mythology, poetry, ceremony, dance and art from many ancient cultures
around the world, I experienced the sacred female. 

Almost 45 years after beginning my journey, and with all of our new technology
and communications, the Divine Feminine has made herself known again. 

Through the ancient arts of design, painting, metal-smithing and stone cutting,
I am making her icons, legends, lore and symbolism readily available, constructed
with high quality metals and real semi-precious and precious stones made as my offering for the
goddess: You.  Angelia

Dedicated to the Sacred, Living, Divine Flame of
Inspiration in all of us ...

the Phoenix Wing Enhancer Collection










As
a child reading a history book, I can't remember the name of, I came across an
old spelling of the word, ‘fire’. Whether it was Celtic, Welsh, Viking, I can’t
remember, but 
the meaning haunted me: fire from liquid or gas, “swamp fire”, spelled FYR. Then,
reading the legends of the Phoenix, how it sprung forth from the heart of an
Eternal God,
like the soul released into the heavens!
Later, after reading the stories of The Goddess Hathor, and her tears, being
the fluid seed for gods and men, I was inspired.
It lived in my subconscious, weaving
through almost everything I did. And now, expressed in metal and stone, my
representation of this process is combined
with ancient icons, based on earliest
legends, and imagery. I give you my dream, my vision. Angelia

TRANSFORMATION INTO THE
BENU BIRD (the Phoenix)


Up
out of primeval matter. I came into being like the god Khepera. I germinated
like the plants. I am concealed  like the
tortoise [in his shell]. I am the seed of every god. I am Yesterday of the Four
[Quarters of the Earth, and] the Seven Uraei, who came into being in the
Eastern land. [I am] the Great One (Horus) who illumineth the Hememet spirits
with the light of his body. [I am] that god in respect of Set. [I am] Thoth who
[stood] between them (Horus and Set) as the judge on behalf of the Governor of
Sekhem and the Souls of Anu. [He was like] a stream between them. I have come.
I rise up on my throne. I am endowed with Khu. I am mighty. I am endowed with
godhood among the gods. I am Khensu, [the lord] of every kind of strength. He
shall see the  Disk [of the Sun], he
shall be in good case upon earth before Ra and His word shall be truth in the
sight of Osiris and no evil thing, what so ever, shall have dominion over him
for ever  and  ever. 
The Book of Coming Forth by Day 
Translated E.A. Wallis Budge


The
PHOENIX  Self
Created’ , ‘Lord of Jubilees ‘, ‘The Ascending One’



“I
am the Bennu Bird, the Heart-Soul of RA, the Guide of the Gods through the
underworld” (Egyptian book f the Dead). To ‘Become the Phoenix’ is to ‘Rise
Brilliantly’ to ‘Shine’.
Legend is that the Phoenix burst forth
from the heart of Osiris during His Resurrection. RA is re-born through the
seeding of Light into Auset (Isis) creating the Horus line of
God-Kings, attaining Immortality through
awakening, burning to ashes the old and painful, as it rises into new life. Its
cry is the most beautiful song, giving the Sun pause as
its voice rises to the Heavens. Said to
always return to Egypt to rest upon The Ben Ben Stone in The Temple of the
Phoenix, considered one of the most sacred places on 
Earth until The Stone was stolen, the temple defiled. A universal symbol of
free will, healing & ascension spanning thousands of years, bridging time
& cultures.


The
WINGED DISK






Ancient,
often carved in stone to last for eternity, associated with royalty,
governance, power. Representing the ‘true light’ of ascension which humanity is
to attain through revelation, 


awareness
and responsibility. A symbol worn by Light Bearers, in the name of RA (the
light) and Horus, a sign of the new Golden Age of Sovereignty.


































A Contract in Good Faith is Broken, The Dream is
Nearly Shattered!  


After weeks of near silence with messages of ‘I
am moving’, on launch day for our Website, Social Media and Crowd funding, the
owner of the company 
we hired and paid $7,500.00 to build our sites and Crowd funding contacted us
and said he was not delivering. We had almost nothing, and what 
little he had done was wrong and under
phoenixfyr.net, not our .com. Our professionally produced film wasn’t edited or
converted…we were in trouble!













 Women with Mad Skills, Terri, Jane and Marie
are Professionals in PR and marketing, and they have moved forward with all the
Social Networking and doing what they do so well. Only 2

website building, and Jo who had some HTML. My mother is editing! We went to
work November 1st. On November 4th, we had completely re-built the
website, with the same files we had sent to the Website and Marketing Company.
This is Day 3 of creating the first Crowd Funding Campaign or Project. Our
Video was never edited, compressed or converted, so, we did one. This has

The metals
Copyrights
Market research reports
Prototypes for testing    The first step was the
most difficult without Sherri, my original metalsmith. I had never done metalwork
pieces without her. The designer pieces were her metalsmith work and my
designs. I called her brother, Tom, at Handley’s Rock and Jewelry and it became
very simple. Tom said he would be more than happy to custom cut my stones for
the jewelry and that he would make a few phone calls.  Within hours of initial contact, he had
called their current metalsmith and arranged for me to meet with her. He also
contacted a wax maker for me. 




 

At Handley’s
Rock and Jewelry store in Vancouver, I spoke with Arlene Handley, known for her
wall of personally hand-picked strands of stone beads and the information that
goes with them. She immediately began taking down beads, and pulling specialty
jewelers fittings/findings out for me. She shared expert advice, and said that
she’d help me throughout the process.


Then, I had
waxes fabricated. I was very unhappy with the machined waxes, and wanted
something better, but I had no idea who could hand cut waxes like Sherry did. I
decided, during our appointment, to ask Beth from Overcast Studio about my
situation. When I told her the machine pieces from my renderings were NOT going
to work out for me, she said she could HAND CARVE the waxes, make hand pressed
molds, and do the first jewelry with reclaimed silverware. She laughed and asked
what the family silver looked like. The costs went up at that point, but the Originals
had to be hand cut. Designer pieces from start to finish.




Jo Diamond
came in as an investor at this point, making the next steps possible. Hand
carved waxes and hand-made molds are incredibly expensive, but it. I was
pleased that she agreed. She wanted the jewelry as much as Terri did. I signed
her on, and we waited for the completion, as the price of silver went up.


The waxes
and molds were coming close to completion, and I had chosen silver for the
metal for the first set for a multitude of reasons. Beth's comment about the
silverware drifted through my mind again, and a light bulb went off: Paul
Hamilton and Norbert Anderson, who I’d been working with for gems and minerals as
well as estate jewelry for my one of a kind Menats, for decades. I contacted
Paul and made an appointment. I told them my situation: I had no family silver,
and a limited budget for this. Norbert generously donated me a sum of cash and
Paul Hamilton started handing me mis-matched silverware by the fistfuls. Their
support was very important; They have been in the jewelry business since the
‘80’s.  Norbert said ‘copyright, Copyright,
COPYRIGHT’. I told him I was on it!






On August 10th I had submitted 36
copyrights (with 117 derivatives). The process was intense, and even with the
background I had in jewelry making, this was a new and different world, I was
learning more as I went, while the silverware from Paul was steadily becoming
the first complete prototypes for Quality Control and my testers. Tom was hard
at work on more stones. 


There was a great deal of market
research involved, and I was finalizing my 248 page document around the middle
of September. The gem suppliers I had been dealing with for over 20 years from India
and Bali were no longer at U.S. gem shows and the orders I had made were
arriving with the wrong stones, incorrect measurements and findings. A jewelry
designer friend of mine suggested a new stone supplier elsewhere, and made the connections
happen. The stones were fabulous! I went to work with this new company for the
test pieces. Between Handley’s Rock & Jewelry, Overcast Studios, and this
new company, I had 12 sets of jewelry prototypes ready go through 18 months of
rigorous testing. I traveled in October for a personal meeting with the
marketing company representative. I turned over 3 sets of prototypes for
Quality Control, and learned there was interest from 3 additional Countries. I
also received a new fulfilment list. It was very in depth, but I had around a
year, because the jewelry had to be tested by people who would wear it, and the
production designs had to be tested also. I knew there would be changes coming.

<p>Imagine risking your life on a glass of clean 
water. For an astounding amount of people around the world, this is 
daily reality. The numbers are staggering. Over nine-thousand deaths 
occur around the world every day due to water water bourn illnesses, and
 nearly nine-hundred-million people world wide lack access to clean 
water. However, our world doesn't have to remain this way.</p>
<p>Together, we can close the gap between those with access to clean water, and those without.</p>

<p>Its not only a rad Tee shirt design of ours; 
on average, over eight hundred litres of clean water is created every 
year by each piece in our line. Every quarter of a year, funds from 
Living Water Apparel are invested into global water projects. Our 
primary partner, Turn on the Tap, is a non-profit program that functions
 around the world, constructing wells and bio sand filters, as well as 
providing water sanitation training for the recipients. This process 
isn't a quick or simple fix, and the solutions are not cheap. However, 
the reliable life expectancy of one bio sand filter alone runs in the 
vicinity of 15 to 20 years.  The funds from just one hoodie or tee shirt
 can produce up to<i> 1,200 litres of water clean water per year.</i></p>

<h1>Swag</h1>
<p>All Living Water Apparel is sourced and produced 
responsibly. We print here in Canada on Bella Canvas apparel, and we stand by our production process with unwavering commitment to quality. Many
 hours have been spent on design refinements, and the evidence is in the
 fit, feel, and look of our Apparel. As with anything made with love, 
you'll just get it. We believe design is like soup. Those without 
attention to detail may not notice the difference between one pot and 
the other. But, like a pinch of salt can save the batch, so good design 
can bring life to any project.  In the process of achieving this 
""saltiness"", we have had the pleasure of working together with a lot of 
people we love, and we really couldn't be more proud of the results.</p>

Motivation
Imagine risking your life on a glass of clean 
water. For an astounding amount of people around the world, this is 
daily reality. The numbers are staggering. Over nine-thousand deaths 
occur around the world every day due to water water bourn illnesses, and
 nearly nine-hundred-million people world wide lack access to clean 
water. However, our world doesn't have to remain this way.
Together, we can close the gap between those with access to clean water, and those without.






Eight Hundred 
Its not only a rad Tee shirt design of ours; 
on average, over eight hundred litres of clean water is created every 
year by each piece in our line. Every quarter of a year, funds from 
Living Water Apparel are invested into global water projects. Our 
primary partner, Turn on the Tap, is a non-profit program that functions
 around the world, constructing wells and bio sand filters, as well as 
providing water sanitation training for the recipients. This process 
isn't a quick or simple fix, and the solutions are not cheap. However, 
the reliable life expectancy of one bio sand filter alone runs in the 
vicinity of 15 to 20 years.  The funds from just one hoodie or tee shirt
 can produce up to 1,200 litres of water clean water per year.



Swag
All Living Water Apparel is sourced and produced 
responsibly. We print here in Canada on Bella Canvas apparel, and we stand by our production process with unwavering commitment to quality. Many
 hours have been spent on design refinements, and the evidence is in the
 fit, feel, and look of our Apparel. As with anything made with love, 
you'll just get it. We believe design is like soup. Those without 
attention to detail may not notice the difference between one pot and 
the other. But, like a pinch of salt can save the batch, so good design 
can bring life to any project.  In the process of achieving this 
""saltiness"", we have had the pleasure of working together with a lot of 
people we love, and we really couldn't be more proud of the results.



Don't forget, kids, tags are out.  Freshen up and love your wardrobe even more with our itch-free, screen printed labels







Progression
We will be spending the remainder of 2015 
processing pledges and preparing for fulfillment in mid February.  Once 
the campaign has concluded, we will send out an order details survey to 
hear about your choices in size and colour. Shipping shall begin in mid 
February, and your swag should arrive within two to three weeks.

</h2><p>In 2014 I made a shirt for my husband’s best friend, Dr Matt Taylor, as a
birthday gift – then he wore it on TV. He is part of the European Space Agency
team that landed the Philae probe on a Comet (the Rosetta Landing) and the
shirt caused something of a media storm! <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446377488/gweautjgnoptrdqsgjzl.png"" src="""" style=""width: 316.936px; height: 399px;""/></p><br/>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446377601/gmm3entuwo544on2epxn.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 321px; height: 321px;""/></p><br/>
<p>Apart from a certain amount of hate mail (some people really don’t
appreciate pin-up art) that both Matt and I received – there was huge support
for us too. In a matter of days I had orders for 300 shirts. </p>
<h3><br/></h3><h3><b>A business was born </b></h3>
<p>There’s a limit to what one woman with a sewing machine can do in her spare
time – so I took a leap of faith and with lots of support from my husband, Matt
and my friends, I quit my day job and became a professional seamstress. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446322200/b2i5pl5qemtvygyoui1i.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 208.736px; height: 299px;""/></p><br/><p></p><p>The journey has been amazing and I’ve learned a lot – some of it the hard
way! </p>
<p>I researched mass production and found a UK manufacturer that would meet my
(very high) quality standards. I talked to the original fabric producers in the
USA and persuaded them to relaunch the material design of the original shirt
(it had been discontinued at the time). </p>
<p>I found myself in the press, on digital TV stations and radio interviews
across the globe – and my Twitter and Facebook following generated a huge
amount of business. (Search for #shirtstorm to find out more). </p>
<p>I had some family investment to help me get started and I used it to buy
materials and pay for manufacturing. The last year has been exciting and
challenging – but I’ve managed to pay the bills and I've got a lot more orders for shirts,
skirts and other items. </p>
<p></p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446326699/jiwflouxojfajhcvgooh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<h3><br/></h3><h3><b>Now what? </b></h3>
<p>I’m constantly resourcing good quality 100% cotton in designs that appeal to
my market – and I’ve found that many people want bespoke items, and that keeps
me busy. I’ve made a wedding dress in cartoon fabric, tailored shorts in
fabulous pin up material, tote bags, circular and pencil skirts and even
appliqued the fantastic material onto knickers! </p>
<p>I even – finally – made time to make myself a dress too! </p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446321939/ovwluxuzo0zodbv1udrw.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 282.972px; height: 334px;""/></p><br/>
<p>I have a few celebrity clients and had a stand at the London Film and Comic Convention
which was hugely successful and got a lot of attention (I even had one of the
SFX guys from a VERY high profile film ask me for my autograph!). </p>
<p>These are just a few of the shirts that I’ve made to order over the past
year: </p>
<p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446326548/lni9yzeyogwzhkp9ne4l.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>I’ve even made Matt some new shirts so he has something that is unique – as
a thank you for all the support and encouragement he’s given me and just
because he’s one of my best friends and a great guy! </p>
<h3><br/></h3><h3><b>This is THE FUNDING PLAN! </b></h3>
<p>Even working full time there’s a limit to what I can make – and I need
support to give me the time to resource material, design new items and keep up
with my bespoke commissions. </p>
<p>The funding I need will: </p>
<p>* Give me administrative support to keep up with my social media and
marketing </p>
<p>* Enable me to have a wider range of garments manufactured </p>
<p>* Allow me to purchase larger quantities of material (at better rates to
bring the cost per item down) in a wider range of designs </p>
<p>* Develop a kids’ range of comic material shorts and tops – which I’ve
frequently been asked about – but haven’t had the time or resources to develop.
</p>
<p>* Develop the Vivian James hoodie – a project I’m already exploring. </p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446322316/q8xxgoxzur0onnolu8sp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>I’ve been in discussion with a very well-known comic artist about producing
our own completely exclusive fabric – that nobody else will have – and that’s
going to require investment. <br/></p><p><br/></p>

<p>The risk with garment manufacture is always getting the order levels right.

need financial help to get expert marketing support. </p>
<p>Many people have asked why I don’t resource material and/or manufacturing

</div></div>","The shirt that launched a shirtstorm 
In 2014 I made a shirt for my husband’s best friend, Dr Matt Taylor, as a
birthday gift – then he wore it on TV. He is part of the European Space Agency
team that landed the Philae probe on a Comet (the Rosetta Landing) and the
shirt caused something of a media storm! 

Apart from a certain amount of hate mail (some people really don’t
appreciate pin-up art) that both Matt and I received – there was huge support
for us too. In a matter of days I had orders for 300 shirts. 
A business was born 
There’s a limit to what one woman with a sewing machine can do in her spare
time – so I took a leap of faith and with lots of support from my husband, Matt
and my friends, I quit my day job and became a professional seamstress. The journey has been amazing and I’ve learned a lot – some of it the hard
way! 
I researched mass production and found a UK manufacturer that would meet my
(very high) quality standards. I talked to the original fabric producers in the
USA and persuaded them to relaunch the material design of the original shirt
(it had been discontinued at the time). 
I found myself in the press, on digital TV stations and radio interviews
across the globe – and my Twitter and Facebook following generated a huge
amount of business. (Search for #shirtstorm to find out more). 
I had some family investment to help me get started and I used it to buy
materials and pay for manufacturing. The last year has been exciting and
challenging – but I’ve managed to pay the bills and I've got a lot more orders for shirts,
skirts and other items. 

Now what? 
I’m constantly resourcing good quality 100% cotton in designs that appeal to
my market – and I’ve found that many people want bespoke items, and that keeps
me busy. I’ve made a wedding dress in cartoon fabric, tailored shorts in
fabulous pin up material, tote bags, circular and pencil skirts and even
appliqued the fantastic material onto knickers! 
I even – finally – made time to make myself a dress too! 

I have a few celebrity clients and had a stand at the London Film and Comic Convention
which was hugely successful and got a lot of attention (I even had one of the
SFX guys from a VERY high profile film ask me for my autograph!). 
These are just a few of the shirts that I’ve made to order over the past
year: 

I’ve even made Matt some new shirts so he has something that is unique – as
a thank you for all the support and encouragement he’s given me and just
because he’s one of my best friends and a great guy! 
This is THE FUNDING PLAN! 
Even working full time there’s a limit to what I can make – and I need
support to give me the time to resource material, design new items and keep up
with my bespoke commissions. 
The funding I need will: 
* Give me administrative support to keep up with my social media and
marketing 
* Enable me to have a wider range of garments manufactured 
* Allow me to purchase larger quantities of material (at better rates to
bring the cost per item down) in a wider range of designs 
* Develop a kids’ range of comic material shorts and tops – which I’ve
frequently been asked about – but haven’t had the time or resources to develop.

* Develop the Vivian James hoodie – a project I’m already exploring. 

I’ve been in discussion with a very well-known comic artist about producing
our own completely exclusive fabric – that nobody else will have – and that’s
going to require investment. 
Risks & Challenges 
The risk with garment manufacture is always getting the order levels right.
I’ve already experienced what happens when you order too much material (storage
challenges and tying up cash in stock). With a year’s experience I’ve got a
much better idea now of sensible ordering levels. 
I’ve had a roller coaster first year and I’ve got good brand awareness in my

<h3>HISTORY</h3> <p></p>
<p>Hi, my name is Flora Hartyandi, I am an experimental artist
from Hungary. I work in the cultural field and in addition I make my unique
creations. <b>Primarily bags, but I make clothes, accessories, pictures, household
objects, party decorations, too</b>. I love recycling, unusual materials and new
techniques. </p>
<p>In the last 15 years, I had my own fashion show, I made some
costumes and sceneris, My grafics were published, I held some workshops and I
sold my creations on several festivals.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449579233/epic7t1ceevpmdpuk2mp.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 374.667px; height: 281px;""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>I already have gained some success: the most recent was a
Canadian wearable fashion competition, where my costume, <b>‘Pets and Wild’</b> also
starred in fashion show in the middle of November, this year.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449579188/gpekgo24i1qc9jvrarco.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 219.505px; height: 329px;""/></p>
<p>Cultural work has become hard in Hungary. Nowdays <b>my payment is
enough for rent, but not enough for anything else. My work will be finished</b> in
begining of next year. After that I could start my art buisness, finally. I
wanted it since I was a child. The buisness name is will be Punctually Punch.</p>
<p>I created my blog -<a href=""https://punctuallypunch.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> punctuallypunch.wordpress.com </a>- a few month
ago and posted some old and current artworks. Nowadays I am working on the
buissness details, the identity, some plans and some bag collections.</p>

<p></p> </div> <div style=""text-align: center;""> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>If I want a professional operating buissness I will need some
tools. </p>
<p>Now I’m using an old, hobby sewing machine and my own hands,
which is a good meditative program but very slow, so it doesn’t pay off. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449579601/ehylumg3i3yqqpm5mstj.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 325.201px; height: 230px;""/></p>

<p>Above that I would buy some other little things. too. All of
these could accelerate and make my workflow more diverse: a sewing mannequin;
leather-wright tools; home screen printing tools; tailor tools;  etc. </p>
<p></p>

HISTORY 
Hi, my name is Flora Hartyandi, I am an experimental artist
from Hungary. I work in the cultural field and in addition I make my unique
creations. Primarily bags, but I make clothes, accessories, pictures, household
objects, party decorations, too. I love recycling, unusual materials and new
techniques. 
In the last 15 years, I had my own fashion show, I made some
costumes and sceneris, My grafics were published, I held some workshops and I
sold my creations on several festivals.



I already have gained some success: the most recent was a
Canadian wearable fashion competition, where my costume, ‘Pets and Wild’ also
starred in fashion show in the middle of November, this year.


Cultural work has become hard in Hungary. Nowdays my payment is
enough for rent, but not enough for anything else. My work will be finished in
begining of next year. After that I could start my art buisness, finally. I
wanted it since I was a child. The buisness name is will be Punctually Punch.
I created my blog - punctuallypunch.wordpress.com - a few month
ago and posted some old and current artworks. Nowadays I am working on the
buissness details, the identity, some plans and some bag collections.








   What We Need & What You Get 
If I want a professional operating buissness I will need some
tools. 
Now I’m using an old, hobby sewing machine and my own hands,
which is a good meditative program but very slow, so it doesn’t pay off. 



A
second hand, middle-aged industrial sewing machine which would be perfect for
me.This machine is the most important thing in the first place.
Above that I would buy some other little things. too. All of
these could accelerate and make my workflow more diverse: a sewing mannequin;
leather-wright tools; home screen printing tools; tailor tools;  etc. 

If you would and can help me with my first steps, in exchange
for your donation, I can give you a unique creation. All of them are completed,
and now they are waiting for their owners.
Please check out the photos with the details and choose one of
them.




    Other Ways You Can Help 
If you love my works but you can’t donate, don’t worry! Please
post this page everywhere (facebook, twitter etc.) and share it with everybody.
This activity would be a big help for me, too!
If you would want to help me another way, please write
me an email: punctuallypunch@gmail.com****************************************************************************

****************************************************************************ELŐZMÉNYEK
Hartyándi Flóra vagyok, egy kísérletező alkotóművész
Magyarországról. Jelenleg főállásban kulturális területen dolgozom, ami a
forráshiányok és az átszervezések miatt évről évre egyre nehezebb. Egyedi
kreációimat munka mellett készítem. Főképp táskákat, de ruhákat, kiegészítőket,
képeket, használati tárgyakat és party dekorációkat is csinálok. A szokatlan
anyagok és a hagyományok újraértelmezése jellemzi leginkább műveimet.

Az elmúlt 15 évben volt saját divat bemutatóm, készítettem jelmezeket - díszleteket különböző produkciókhoz, kiadványokban jelentek meg grafikáim, tartottam műhely foglalkozásokat és több alkalommal árultam fesztiválok keretében az alkotásaimat.



Tipikus-, kínai boltban kapható, kisállatos festmény-nyomatból
készített ruhám, amely a ’Pets and Wild’ elnevezést viseli, most novemberben
került kifutóra Kanadában, egy szokatlan, de hordható viseleteket bemutató
divat-show keretében. 



Ezen a sikeren felbuzdulva és a jelenlegi fizetésemet
megvizsgálva – amely az albérletre elég, de másra már nem – arra jutottam, hogy
itt az ideje megpróbálni a saját lábamra állni és gyermekkori vágyamat
megvalósítani.
Aktuális munkám a jövő év elején véget ér, ekkor szeretném
elindítani saját művészeti vállalkozásomat, Punctually Punch néven. 
Ezen terv megszületése óta, készítettem egy blogot -
punctuallypunch.wordpress.com – és egy facebook oldalt –
facebook.com/punctuallypunch- amelyeken először a régebbi, majd a mostani
munkáimat teszem közzé. Aktuálisan a leendő vállalkozásom részletein, az üzleti
terven, az arculaton és különböző kollekciókon dolgozom.



AMIRE SZÜKSÉGEM VAN
Amennyiben profi üzletet szeretnék üzemeltetni, néhány eszközre
szükségem lesz.
Jelenleg egy régi, hobby varrógépet használok, illetve gyakran
a két kezemet, amely kellemes meditatív munka, de lassúsága miatt nem valami
kifizetődő. 


Szeretnék venni egy használt, középkorú ipari varrógépet, ami
tökéletes lenne nekem.
Ez a gép a legfontosabb az első időkben.
Ezen túl szeretnék pár egyéb apróságot is. Mindezek gyorsítják
és sokszínűbbé teszik a munka folyamataimat: próba baba, bőr műves-, házi szita
nyomáshoz való-, valamint szabó kellékek stb. 
AMIT KAPSZ
Amennyiben szeretnél és tudod is segíteni első lépéseimet, az
adományodért cserében egyedi kreációt adok neked. Minden darab már elkészült és
várja az új gazdáját.
Kérlek nézd meg a fotókat, leírásokat és válassz közülük!

Ha tetszik, amit csinálok, de nem tudsz anyagilag támogatni, ne
aggódj! Kérlek posztold ezt az oldalt mindenfelé (facebook, twitter stb.) és

Magyar dizájnerek tervezik, magyar nagymamák horgolják!

Donner Andrea és Mike Tünde. Mi vagyunk a Freshka Design megálmodói.Segítsetek nekünk és a velünk együttműködő közel 100 nagymamának! Mutassuk meg együtt Európának! Tegyük együtt nemzetközileg ismertté a Freshka Design horgolt
játékait! 



 a Freshka Design jelenleg közel 100
nagymamával, munkanélküli vagy megváltozott munkaképességű nővel dolgozik
együtt. Ha kijutunk Nürnbergbe, ez a szám a duplájára, triplájára nőhet.
 játékaink mind magas minőségű, kézzel
készült, magyar dizájn termékek. Ha kijutunk Nürnbergbe, jó hírét visszük Magyarországnak.
 a horgolás hazánkban nagy tradíciókra
tekint vissza. Ha kijutunk Nürnbergbe új lehetőségek nyílhatnak meg előttünk, hogy még jobban hasznosítsuk azt a rengeteg
tehetséget és tudást, ami körülöttünk van.
 a Freshka Design játékai itthon már
bizonyítottak és több ezer családban megtalálhatóak Magyarországon. Ha kijutunk
Nürnbergbe meghódíthatjuk egész Európát!
 játékaink CE minősítéssel is rendelkeznek,
ami azt jelenti, hogy újszülött kortól biztonsággal adhatóak gyerekeknek és
megfelelnek az EU-s szabványoknak.
elképesztően
cukik a játékaink!
Saját tervezésű figuráink mindegyikét nagymamák szorgos kezei készítik
országszerte. Kiválasztásukban fontos szempont volt, hogy magas minőségű,
precíz munkát végezzenek. Zebulon, a zebra, Oszkár az oroszlán és a többiek
kiegészítő keresetet biztosítanak olyanoknak, akiknek nagy szükségük van erre.Szeretnénk, ha munkatársaink számát többszázra növelhetnénk, ehhez azonban
el kell érnünk egy sokkal nagyobb piacot! Itt az idő, hogy ezek a figurák ne
csak Magyarországon, de Európa-szerte ismertek és megvásárolhatóak legyenek.  Ezzel fenntarthatóvá válik a Freshka Design
működése, csapatának bővítése és lehetőség nyílik újabb termékek gyártására,
fejlesztésére.Már vannak viszonteladóink Bécsben, Salzburgban, Svédországban,
Németországban. Egy-egy bolt... de Nürnbergben egyszerre érhetjük el a nemzetközi
játék- és design kereskedelem képviselőit!A Nürnbergi Nemzetközi Játékkiállítás a legnagyobb játékmustra minden évben.
Nagy dolog, ha itt bemutatkozhat egy cég, nekünk nagyon régi álmunk ez. Hisszük, hogy ott várnak
minket a nagy lehetőségek. Hisszük, hogy a Freshka Design termékei meg fogják
állni helyüket ezen a vásáron.Segíts nekünk, hogy megvalósíthassuk álmunkat és kijussunk a Nürnbergi Nemzetközi Játékkiállításra!A költségek legnagyobb részét a stand bérlése teszi ki: 3000$. Ezen kívül egy 4 napos vásárnál a szállás is nagy költség, még akkor is ha olcsó megoldást keresünk és időben lefoglaljuk, és természetesen ennyi cuccal az utazás is bonyolult. Szükség lesz továbbá szóróanyagokra, a stand dekorációjára és egy elég nagy raktárkészletre, aminek segítségével bemutathatjuk magunkat az érdeklődőknek. Ezekhez kérjük a támogatásotokat!A Freshka Design 2012-ben jelentette meg első horgolt figuráit, ekkor
született meg a Zebulon és barátai horgolt kollekció. Mára már több mint harmincféle figura gazdagítja a kínálatunkat. Horgolt figuráink a felhasznált
alapanyagoknak és az alkalmazott technikának köszönhetően bababarátok,
biztonságosak és egyediek. Élénk színek, puha pamut borítás teszik a figurákat
kicsik és nagyok kedvencévé.Horgolt figuráinkat magunk tervezzük, és elsősorban hátrányos helyzetű,
munkanélküli, vagy megváltozott munkaképességű, magyar nők készítik. Más
termékeink gyártásakor is keressük az együttműködést olyan szervezetekkel,
egyesületekkel, ahol valamilyen módon a társadalmi felzárkóztatásban is
segíteni tudunk. Így dolgoztunk együtt már az Igazgyöngy Alapítvánnyal, a Frushka babáinkat pedig a dombóvári Reménység Napközi Otthon lakói készítik.Először szerettük volna kipróbálni magunkat itthon. Kiismerni a vállalkozói
lét nehézségeit és lehetőségeit, kitapasztalni kapacitásunkat, korlátainkat és
korlátlanságunkat! Ez az elmúlt 3 évben megtörtént és most készen állunk, hogy
nemzetközi szinten is bemutatkozzunk!Segíts nekünk, hogy megvalósíthassuk álmunkat és kijussunk a Nürnbergi Nemzetközi Játékkiállításra!

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Lost parcels are always an issue when it comes to selling physical goods, which I experienced during my last Kickstarter campaign, where I sent wallets to individual backers up to three times, and yet wallets kept getting lost. That is the main challenge to this project in the stage I am in, but I have tried to get around that by this time using a domestic US Fulfilment center for US orders, and a British Fulfilment center for European orders, and limiting where I ship to Europe, US/Canada and Australia. As frustrating it is to back a project and not receive anything, it is equally frustrating to create something and keep sending wallets that never arrives.</p>

Vegetable tanned leatherThe vegetable tanned leather used in Axess Front Wallets models is hand tanned in Tuscany, Italy following strict standards and use traditional tanning methods in their production of some of the world’s finest vegetable tanned leather.Model 05 'Superior' - Blue ColorThe leather is made by hand with the passion of a few master tanners located in Tuscany using techniques and traditions hailing from the Renaissance, which means that there are no harmful chemicals used in the tanning process.Vegetable tanned leather ages and develops a patina over time, making each wallet uniquely yours. Vegetable tanning is more time consuming than other types of leather tanning (such as chrome based tanning), but the result is a much richer patina developed with no use of harmful chemicals that holds up better than other leather and lasts longer.Axess is designed to fit seamlessly in your front pocket so that you don't have to sit on your bulky wallet.Saffiano leather    Saffiano leather, which is a type of textured genuine leather common in modern day luxury accessories originally developed by Prada in 1913. The Saffiano gives the wallet a cross hatch finish which not only looks exclusive but also makes the wallet scratch resistant and durable. In addition, the treated wax finish also gives this Saffiano wallet water resistant properties.Model 04 'Triumph' - Pink ColorModel 07 'Ideal' - Caramel ColorPassionately handmadeEach wallet is passionately made by hand, using methods of hand cutting with special cutting tools – all credit card slots and edges are also cut by hand to ensure perfection. The lining consists of carefully selected eco-friendly cotton fabrics, and each wallet is separately stitched with durable Polyester/Cotton Core spun Thread, using precision machines to ensure a tight and strong stitching. Each piece is also individually embossed and inspected in person by the manufacturer to ensure that each wallet is delivered in a pristine state.Model 05 'Superior' - Caramel ColorModel 03 'Smooth' - Blue Color.Model 03 'Smooth' - Caramel Color.Partial RFID-blocking walletsAll of Axess wallets have an RFID blocking pocket where special material will protect your sensitive cards (similar to physically wrapping your credit cards in tin foil). This is to prevent your sensitive credit card information from being subjected to “electronic pickpocketing” or other methods of wirelessly accessing your credit card info or personal information. The RFID-blocking material used by Axess is a multi-layered RFID-protection foil that has successfully gone through third-party testing and verification.All wallets come with an RFID-blocking pocket.The idea behind having a partially RFID-blocking wallet is that you should still be able to scan your subway card and access cards if you use them in the wallets' other pockets.

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Our brand for contemporary watches was launched by me, Paulus van Leeuwen, in 1992 in the Netherlands. </span></p>
<div>
<p>With a history in design for the ceramic industry, I emphasize the three dimensional nature
of design. It is my habit to approach the design of our watches more as sculptured objects, often leading to surprising and subtle detail, even on the back of the
watches. I simply refuse to look at watches as only graphical objects: ""dials and straps"".</p>

<p><i>Our logo, as usual: only on the back.</i></p>
<br/>
<p>The integration of high
quality execution &amp; reduced design in combination with proven reliable swiss movements have always been at the heart of Quantuz
watches.</p>
<p>Materials like Stainless
Steel, Sapphire Crystal, Aluminium and Titanium are allowed to flourish with these aesthetic choices, giving rise to a nice unison  of material
in resonance with the different textures in one design.</p>
<p>We aim for quality watches,
both physically and aesthetically. Doing so, they last for decades and we found quantuz-lovers in many corners of the world.  We still offer service to
those loyal and grateful owners of a Quantuz watch as far back as 1992. </p>

<i>
</i><p>Unlike many other campaigns for watches we do not show you technical
drawings provided by the case manufacturer, often nicely romanticized with pencils
and Vernier-calipers. Neither will we bother you with pencil sketches that
hardly have a relationship to the actual design.</p>
<p>Our design process follows other tracks, the result of 35 year experience
in product and watch design, including the use of 3D design software, 3D
printing, in house prototyping and product development in very close communication with our manufacturing partners in
Hong-Kong and Switzerland.</p>
<p>We like to share a few images though, which shed some light on the process that we went through during the development. This is the real thing!</p>
<p>A
vast number of sculptural, proportional and dimensional studies, cross-sections,
prototypes, refinements, and a pile of communication later, we finalized this joyful
and stylish line of watches for both <b>men and women</b> and for wearing on any occasion you can imagine!</p>

With a history in design for the ceramic industry, I emphasize the three dimensional nature
of design. It is my habit to approach the design of our watches more as sculptured objects, often leading to surprising and subtle detail, even on the back of the
watches. I simply refuse to look at watches as only graphical objects: ""dials and straps"".




Our logo, as usual: only on the back.

The integration of high
quality execution & reduced design in combination with proven reliable swiss movements have always been at the heart of Quantuz
watches.
Materials like Stainless
Steel, Sapphire Crystal, Aluminium and Titanium are allowed to flourish with these aesthetic choices, giving rise to a nice unison  of material
in resonance with the different textures in one design.
We aim for quality watches,
both physically and aesthetically. Doing so, they last for decades and we found quantuz-lovers in many corners of the world.  We still offer service to
those loyal and grateful owners of a Quantuz watch as far back as 1992. 
If you want to have an impression of our history: Please visit this page of the Quantuz website and scroll down.





The latest design that we released in a first production run and present to you here is our line ""Shades of Grey"" (not 50!). In short we say: ""Shades Of"", it could be any color after all!




We started this colorful line with a limited number of 24 color combinations. Some of them are joyful, some of them are very distinguished and some even funny. These color combinations were compiled in collaboration with our color-stylist Cécile van Eeden who happens to be my partner in business and in life as well. She is also a great jewellery designer and goldsmith. We work closely on all our mutual projects.







No brand on the dial. It keeps the design clean, as we like it.
Tiny second hand, it shows the watch is alive and kicking.
Carefully designed lugs for perfect fit on the wrist. Lugs have the same color as the ring with dots under the glass.

Two different colored hands. A Quantuz habit too, but very functional in fact.




Business or smart casual.





Leisure



Creator
Design your own watch.
Now we are ready to expand the 'Shades Of' series for the next production run and that is where you come in. We can expand the color range of this watch to more than 2700 color combinations of your choice with the help of our 'Shades Of' Creator.








Do yourself the favor of trying the creator, it's really exciting, even more so with a friend!   
With your help:




We can further develop our online marketing, in order to
reach more enthusiasts all over the globe.                                                                                                                          


We can expand our online community and involve this community in future projects.                         


      You already help us by sharing this campaign !                


We can fine-tune or expand the executions of our designs with the feedback from our backers.       

      We are open to any suggestion but cannot promise to fulfill them all.                                                                                                                                      


We can give a boost to our future projects.                                       

     We are working on a automatic watch for men and a extra flat quartz watch             in two sizes, fully Swiss Made.....Stay tuned on our newsletters, Facebook and soon also Instagram! 

The amount of € 15.000,-- that we aim for will help us to realize a vast portion of what we want to achieve.  
If we raise more we can speed up our plans.If we raise less (we chose for a flexible goal) we will be able to fulfill a smaller part of what we want to achieve but it will certainly make it possible to improve our online presence and expand our community.  Also we will have assembled and seen many versions of the watch as compiled by you, that we did not make before. This must be a great pleasure and we are looking forward to it!Whatever the result of our campaign, we will be able to make all our backers happy with the perk of their choice, including their very individual color combination. We are lined up for it.The choice from several thousands of individual color combinations will be facilitated by our creator that you find below. We think it explains itself. Use the resulting order code for our survey after the campaign. 

If you prefer to choose one of our 24 standard styles, simply communicate to us the right order code. Just follow the link below. 24 Standard Models






Product Specifications
Powered by a large and strong Swiss Made Ronda 783 movement. 
Durable clear sight on dial and hands through a scratch proof Sapphire Crystal. 
The 37mm watchcase is 3ATM water resistant and made of anodised aluminium. This allows for the many elegant colour combinations with the bezel, a 316L surgical grade stainless steel ring that covers the majority of the outside of the watch and also available in PVD: Gunmetal, Grey, Brown and Navy-blue.

In Depth
Product development 'Shades of'


Unlike many other campaigns for watches we do not show you technical
drawings provided by the case manufacturer, often nicely romanticized with pencils
and Vernier-calipers. Neither will we bother you with pencil sketches that
hardly have a relationship to the actual design.
Our design process follows other tracks, the result of 35 year experience
in product and watch design, including the use of 3D design software, 3D
printing, in house prototyping and product development in very close communication with our manufacturing partners in
Hong-Kong and Switzerland.
We like to share a few images though, which shed some light on the process that we went through during the development. This is the real thing!
A
vast number of sculptural, proportional and dimensional studies, cross-sections,
prototypes, refinements, and a pile of communication later, we finalized this joyful
and stylish line of watches for both men and women and for wearing on any occasion you can imagine!

Engineering has always made sense to me – there are reasons why some things happen and some things don’t, and I get to be the architect of that reality. When my fiancé’s grandfather was suddenly diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and passed away, I was forced to face an uncontrollable situation where logic or reason didn't apply. I didn’t like it and I decided I should do something about it. The journey of creating <strong>SPRING</strong> was born out of my battle with the unexpected and the unexplainable. When I combined the product, original scrunchies I hand made with my grandmother, with the SPRING mission, I knew I was on the right track.

As homage to breast cancer awareness month (October) and pancreatic cancer awareness month (November), a limited edition pink and purple scrunchie, respectively, is being sold with a portion of the proceeds being donated to the Duke Cancer Institute for breast cancer and pancreatic cancer research. I didn’t like feeling helpless in the face of pancreatic cancer, so I’m deciding to do something about it. In addition- although not exclusively diagnosed in females, breast cancer is a disease dominated by the female experience and I’d like for a product built for the modern woman to be directed towards educating her and saving her. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539925292/fhx0fvbvss9vtyco20c5.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>This past September,<strong> SPRING</strong> donated 100 scrunchies to swag bags for attendees to the ""What's Best for Breasts"" event at the Duke Hospital.

Visit us at:www.springscrunchies.comSPRING scrunchies for goodness' sake.  Built with purpose and poise. Engineered to keep up with the demands of every woman's busy schedule. Meet your hair's new best friend.I’m a systems engineer with a fascination for learning and an obsession with improving the status quo. Engineering has always made sense to me – there are reasons why some things happen and some things don’t, and I get to be the architect of that reality. When my fiancé’s grandfather was suddenly diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and passed away, I was forced to face an uncontrollable situation where logic or reason didn't apply. I didn’t like it and I decided I should do something about it. The journey of creating SPRING was born out of my battle with the unexpected and the unexplainable. When I combined the product, original scrunchies I hand made with my grandmother, with the SPRING mission, I knew I was on the right track. I hope you will enjoy the SPRING scrunchie as much as I do – I wear mine every day for goodness’ sake. At SPRING, the objective is simple – scrunchies for goodness’ sake. Each scrunchie has an associated color-matched cause to which a portion of the proceeds is donated. As homage to breast cancer awareness month (October) and pancreatic cancer awareness month (November), a limited edition pink and purple scrunchie, respectively, is being sold with a portion of the proceeds being donated to the Duke Cancer Institute for breast cancer and pancreatic cancer research. I didn’t like feeling helpless in the face of pancreatic cancer, so I’m deciding to do something about it. In addition- although not exclusively diagnosed in females, breast cancer is a disease dominated by the female experience and I’d like for a product built for the modern woman to be directed towards educating her and saving her. This past September, SPRING donated 100 scrunchies to swag bags for attendees to the ""What's Best for Breasts"" event at the Duke Hospital. The event was geared towards educating the community on breast cancer, detection, and general women's health. We loved to be involved with such a great event and look forward to continuing a partnership with the Duke Cancer Institute.This is our journey of where we began, our current SPRING scrunchie, and why the SPRING scrunchie is different.    As a former Division One field hockey player and mechanical engineering student, I needed a hair product that could keep up. I rocked the tight, high ponytail on the field, and the loose bun in the engineering classroom. My solution to my complex schedule was the scrunchie – but not just any scrunchie, a scrunchie engineered to last longer and hold up my thick hair (and I mean really thick). And the only place I found what I was looking for was in my grandmother’s kitchen in Minnesota. Like any amazing Minnesotan grandma, my grandma Marlis taught me how to sew. The first items we made together were scrunchies and I still wear those originals in my hair today. SPRING scrunchies don’t lose their spring, and once I was inspired by the volunteering mission behind my product – I decided it was time to bring the SPRING scrunchie to the market.   As women, we are strong. We are introspective, brave, and intelligent, and know our strengths. Not only do we know them, we do not apologize for them. We are stylish in our own way and by our own choosing. We are dancers, bankers, chefs, mothers, teachers, engineers, and painters.We are diverse, and so are our needs. But we are all busy, or shall we say, dynamic. We all wear many different ‘hats’ in the course of one day, and have to mentally transition from hat to hat with ease. Shouldn’t we, women, with our dynamic nature, have equally dynamic style? We thought so. Enter - the SPRING scrunchie: a hair solution that’s as dynamic as every woman.See the perks panel to check out the product pairings! One pack, two pack, or three pack - they all come with a limited edition SPRING patch! SPRING scrunchies are the better engineered alternative to the scrunchies on the market today. We have made a product that lasts – no more losing elasticity after only a few wears, the SPRING scrunchie has been engineered to last for years. Not only does the SPRING scrunchie keep its spring, the SPRING scrunchie holds your hair in place. Running a marathon for a cause and want to keep your hair up with a product that cares? – try the SPRING scrunchie. Sick of redoing that low bun that gets messy no matter what you do? – try the SPRING scrunchie. Thick, thin, curly, straight – this product will be your hair’s new best friend. Do yourself a favor and purchase one today for goodness’ sake.  We've broken our goal strategy into our Primary Funding Goal and Additional Goals that we would love to achieve with your support! Each SPRING scrunchie is hand-made by me. I need the capital to pay a manufacturer to produce the SPRING scrunchie, so that the company can grow past my individual quota. It was important to me for these scrunchies to be Made in the USA and made with the same high quality standards that I currently hold for the final product. Here is a break-out of where the goal funding will be spent:Our goal of $10,461 is based upon meeting the demand of a batch order size of 810 scrunchies. Because we every scrunchie is matched with $1, benefitting the Duke Cancer Institute’s breast cancer and pancreatic cancer research areas, the more people who purchase packages with scrunchies – the better! Here are some stretch goals that would enable some exciting add-ons to the SPRING Indiegogo journey: The vision for the online store will be to have three product lines: the athlete, the professional, and the weekend warrior. My aspirations do not end with the scrunchie – I intend to grow the SPRING brand to add more exciting products to the SPRING line.An ode to my mechanical engineering background, the name SPRING lends itself to a mechanical spring, a device that translates potential energy into kinetic energy (or vice versa :) ).

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>London based Ramm Design was launched in 2018 by Charley Ram and veteran shoe designer Kevin Martel (coincidentally an Aries...the other Ram) as a design studio focusing on direct to consumer footwear. Martel has designed footwear and accessories for some of the most iconic names in luxury including Ralph Lauren, Giorgio Armani, Bentley and Aston Martin.</p>
<p>The Ramm footwear philosophy emerged from the knowledge that guys who grew up wearing trainers will not tolerate uncomfortable shoes. After all - <i>What are ‘dress’ shoes today? </i></p>
<p>Fed up with the tedious nature of the seasonal fashion system, Ramm Design has set out to launch products when they are ready and work directly with their customers to evolve the brand<i>. </i></p>
<p>Our mission is to create classic footwear for a modern world incorporating comfort and components more akin to your favourite trainer than a traditional English shoe. A heavy leather sole is a 5000 year old idea...maybe even prehistoric. It survives out of a respect for tradition – not comfort.</p>
<p>We ask ourselves: <i>Does comfortable have to mean ugly or uncool? Why is comfort such a nasty word in fashion? </i></p>
<p>Quality footwear also need not be overpriced. We are selling direct to our consumers online, via trunk shows and pop-up experiences. We call it <i>PHYGITAL</i> retail (Physical + Digital).

<p>We are setting a flexible funding goal of £15,000 to fund the first production of the Ramm 002 Loafer.

<p>We are opting for a flexible funding goal so that all funds raised can go towards new development.

</div></div>","Short Summary
London based Ramm Design was launched in 2018 by Charley Ram and veteran shoe designer Kevin Martel (coincidentally an Aries...the other Ram) as a design studio focusing on direct to consumer footwear. Martel has designed footwear and accessories for some of the most iconic names in luxury including Ralph Lauren, Giorgio Armani, Bentley and Aston Martin.
The Ramm footwear philosophy emerged from the knowledge that guys who grew up wearing trainers will not tolerate uncomfortable shoes. After all - What are ‘dress’ shoes today? 
Fed up with the tedious nature of the seasonal fashion system, Ramm Design has set out to launch products when they are ready and work directly with their customers to evolve the brand. 
Our mission is to create classic footwear for a modern world incorporating comfort and components more akin to your favourite trainer than a traditional English shoe. A heavy leather sole is a 5000 year old idea...maybe even prehistoric. It survives out of a respect for tradition – not comfort.
We ask ourselves: Does comfortable have to mean ugly or uncool? Why is comfort such a nasty word in fashion? 
Quality footwear also need not be overpriced. We are selling direct to our consumers online, via trunk shows and pop-up experiences. We call it PHYGITAL retail (Physical + Digital). Eliminating the traditional wholesale sales model keeps our costing in check and our quality product attainable to all.
We now want to expand our product offering and open our Phygital retail space in central London: this will take additional funding.
We launched Ramm footwear in January with our first classic design, the Ramm 001 Derby. We would now like to now develop the second drop, the Ramm 002 Loafer. This continuous development will take new funding and based on the amazing response to 001 – we can’t wait!

</div></div></div>","A Self-Cleaning everyday sock, utilizing Pure Silver in the latest Micron Tech, Rev is engineered to outperform. Silver has been utilized by NASA, US Special Forces, and Olympic athletes to create germ free textiles.
 
   Silver binds to essential cell components like DNA to neutralize their harmful effect. The process of minimizing the bacteria helps with eliminating odor, prevents skin irritations and more.     Rev comes in two styles and three size options. You will be able to select your preferred style and size in the survey after the campaign has completed. 

 


 
Rev’s ultra soft cotton quickly wicks away moisture so that you stay warm and dry.
The custom MaxBreath™ weaves provides an ultra light feel.
Strategically placed pure silver fibers actively eliminates germs and odor.
The air weave cushion reduces friction to help prevent blisters.
Silicone anti-slip grip helps to minimize movement.
Advanced form fitting matrix eliminates sagging for a custom tailored feel. 

 Rev Socks uses Long-Staple cotton. The longer fibers adds strength, durability and quality while maintaining maximum breathability compared to ordinary cotton.    
  Silver binds to essential cell components like DNA to neutralize their harmful effect. The process of eliminating bacteria helps with odor, prevents allergies such as skin irritations, pimples, asthma, runny nose, sneezing and more. It has taken years of development for silver fabrics to arrive at this level of effectiveness and quality. We use micron technology, a step above nano tech, to coat the entire fiver with pure silver. 
  The benefits of silver have been used by NASA, U.S. Special Forces and Olympic Athletes. Proven effective against microbes such as bacteria and fungus means that silver naturally destroys odor-causing pathogens.   


To add any of our Rev™ 2019 Collection products,  please click on your “Manage your pledge” button (on top side when you open the project page), then click “Change your pledge” and simply add to the total pledge. For multiple quantities please multiply the product's cost.

<p><strong>Who is Novique?</strong><br/>Novique is a footwear and apparel brand founded in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania that was built on the pillars of originality, integrity and perseverance. The name derives from a combination of my son and daughter's first names, Domonique and Nova.<br/><br/>My name is Malcolm Mays, I'm a father, lifetime musician and aspiring entrepreneur. My mission to build a legacy that I can pass to my children keeps my flame of passion lit like a torch in the night. I want to pass them knowledge, ownership, wealth and understanding instead of debt, hardships and lack of awareness. Through necessity, curiosity and perseverance, I developed and nurtured skills such as writing, branding, marketing, graphic design and website development; Novique is a cultivation of all my gifts and skills.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613419366/fj3ir1qiknftdwiinfwn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why am I raising money?</strong><br/>In September, I launched my pre-orders for the Novique Origin via a Facebook video with my prototypes in hand. By this point I had already developed the name and logo, built the website and sourced my product. I was able to show the public what the shoe looked like and the post went somewhat viral. I pledged (and still do) to give back $5 per pair sold, to local community organizations in my hometown of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The two organizations that I chose to donate to was the Boys and Girls Club of Harrisburg and Capital Rebirth Inc. The orders started to pour in and I immediately went into action; I was now able to fund my entire order of 700 pairs, as we peaked at a little under $13K in pre-sales.<br/><br/>Anticipating my order's arrival, I entered a lease agreement for a storage/processing location where I have been paying rent since October/November. The shoes were estimated to be produced in about 4 weeks, but due to employee shortage brought upon by COVID-19 protocols, that production time almost tripled.<br/><br/>Upon completion, my supplier notified me that the shipping cost had increased dramatically to over $12K, for the express service which delivers in a little over a week. The cheaper option of shipping it by sea has been fluctuating between $5K and $7K, which takes about 4 weeks for delivery. At this point, all funds have been depleted. The funds from the pre-order sales have been split between the production of goods and maintaining rent at my processing location, awaiting my shipment.<br/><br/>Currently, my order of 700 pairs of shoes (127 pre-ordered) is sitting with my supplier awaiting shipment, collecting dust. I made the mistake of cutting the pre-orders off at a certain date; I was trying to make it limited and only allowed people to pre-order up until October/November. I wouldn't be in this position if I would have left them open because there was a lot of momentum generated and I believe I would have had the funds necessary to cover this shipping expense. I've had to refund several customers who obviously are disgruntled due to the amount of time they've been waiting for their product(s). At this point, my business' reputation (and mine as well) is at stake and I would hate for this to be seen as a lack of integrity or a malicious move to collect funds and never fulfill orders. <br/><br/>I've been in countless meetings and several phone calls, trying to secure funding, trying to find investors or any solution that will allow me to move forward and pay this outstanding shipping cost.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613419475/pvnjg07cogqlfyzn0u70.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>How will I use the money?</strong><br/>If my minimum goal of $7K is reached, I will immediately contact my supplier to see if I am able to select the standard shipping (by sea). If I am able to raise upwards of $14K, I will select the express shipping so that I can get my pre-orders delivered ASAP and also revive the brand. Each time I have inquired about the shipping, it fluctuates around the same numbers, which is why I have the amount rounded up. If I am able to secure at least $18,500 I will cover the express shipping, pay 2-3 months of rent at my processing location, setup utilities (electric, water, gas, internet) and purchase working equipment (shipping desks, worktop tables and computer equipment). At this tier, I would also be able to establish my distribution chain. <br/><br/>Distribution will initially be handled by me, with receiving, processing and shipping being handled in-house. Estimating there are 5-6 pairs sold a day, I could handle the processing myself. I am fully prepared to hire and educate staff if necessary, in the event that I cannot fulfill the orders myself. After the initial 700 pairs are sold, distribution will then be delegated to ShipBob, a fulfillment company with four warehouses in the United States located in Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas and Bethlehem, PA. ShipBob’s system seamlessly integrates with the online platform that Novique is hosted on, Shopify, and will fulfill orders remotely from their warehouses, after the orders are received on Novique’s platform.</p>

<p><strong>How do I know I can receive my inventory and stay in business?</strong><br/>Initially, Novique raised $12,315.80 in pre-order sales for the first product, the Novique Origin. From there, I launched a quick test advertising campaign on Facebook and Instagram that produced 15 purchases at $6.60 cost per purchase on a $150 item (1 pair of sneakers, pre-sold at $95) with a reach of 3,545 people, costing Novique $99.02 to run the campaign. That equates to spending $99.02 to make $1,425. In order to reach Novique’s first year sales of $315K, 5.75 pairs would need to be sold daily or the equivalent of $863/daily. We reached 3,545 people and earned 15 purchases, so that gives us a number as far as the daily reach, that we would need in order to garnish at least 5.75 pairs sold a day. <br/><br/>Novique knows the exact formula to reach its goals. From these results, a more perfect formula will be crafted for each different type of media that it is presented, allowing us to increase sales while establishing customer retention.<br/><br/>In order to reach Novique’s projected goals over the next three years, it will take intense focus, superior organization skills and amazing adaptability as markets often change. I'm adept at handling these responsibilities. I've put in the initial efforts to: develop the product idea and sales model, design a logo, secure a supplier for product development, build Novique’s website from the detailed script to product images, integrate necessary applications with Shopify’s system, register necessary business filings and develop social media campaigns.<br/><br/><a href=""http://www.noviquewear.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.noviquewear.com</a></p>

<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<p>It started with a quirky conversation about a random topic: ""What are collective nouns?"" In this conversation, our founder Jesus Garcia learned that just like we refer to a group of fish ""school"" and a group of sheep ""herd"", there are some interesting - dare we say funny - names for groups of species. One of these collective nouns lit an idea in his mind: ""band of gorillas"". As he pictured a rock band of gorillas playing instruments, Jesus thought ""That would look good on a t-shirt"".</p>
<p>Critter Collective Crews - or 3C for short - is taking collective nouns and making them into fun designs that will be on display on our great quality products. As a tiny company (of humans, not parrots) in San Francisco, we will ensure our best efforts to provide our customers from all over with the best experience with our products.</p>

</ul><p>WIRTH Hats is a social venture where our profits go towards supporting mental health initiatives. WIRTH Hats is a tribute to loved and lost friends. It’s a commitment to conversation and openness. We aim to break down barriers and promote open dialogue about mental health. The goal of WIRTH Hats is simple: we want everyone in the world to know they are not alone, and we believe owning a WIRTH Hat will help with that. By wearing a WIRTH Hat, we invite you to be open, to listen and to always remember - You’re #WirthIt.” </p><p> </p><p><strong><u>The WIRTH Hats Story</u></strong></p><p>On July 11th, 2014 I received a message from a fellow classmate: “I hate to be the one who announces this news but I think you should know… Jakob Wirth is no longer with us. He died a few days ago, in Turkey.”</p><p>Three months prior: my friend and classmate Jakob Wirth shared with me that he wanted to start a hat company. At the time, Jakob and I were in a masters program called Organizational Innovation and Entrepreneurship at the Copenhagen Business School. There wasn’t a class that went by where we didn’t hear the word innovation, and any idea that came out of our mouths felt like it needed to be unique, in some way.</p><p>When Jakob shared with me that he wanted to start a hat company, it was different. “I love hats, plain and simple. I want to make hats that people are excited to put on every morning,” he told me. I thought about suggesting some sort of x-ray-measuring-brain-wave feature to go along with it – as a way to check the ‘unique’ box – but I bit my tongue. He just wanted to make hats – nice hats that people would be excited to wear. How could anyone argue with that? I also loved a good hat.</p><p>Over the coming months, Jakob and I talked about his hat company a lot. I told him that I thought his last name, Wirth, would make a great company name, and that there were so many opportunities to play on those words. He hummed and hawed about it – while he liked the idea, he thought it seemed a little arrogant for his liking.</p><p>That summer, I left Copenhagen to go back home to Vancouver, Canada.</p><p>That summer, Jakob took his life.</p><p>Seeing those words written today still makes my stomach drop. I remember sitting back and staring at the wall, tears streaming from my face, while hundreds of thoughts circled my mind.</p><p>For the next few weeks, every time I saw a hat, I thought of Jakob’s hat company. I thought of WIRTH. I felt there would be no better way to honour my friend than for Jakob to have his hat company brought to life.</p><p>With the help of a friend, I started down that road. In February 2015, I returned to Copenhagen with 25 WIRTH Hats for Jakob’s family and closest friends. The hats were to honour Jakob’s dream, but more importantly – they were a symbol for the many struggles that lie beyond our view.</p><p>The tags on the hats read: “WIRTH Hats are in memory of Jakob Wirth, who passed away last year. Jakob’s dream was to create a hat company that people would love, so here’s toWIRTH Hats. May these hats serve as a reminder that when going through difficult times, there are always people to reach out to, as we are never alone as we sometimes think we are.”</p><p>This is where I thought the WIRTH Hats story would end.</p><p>It was meant to be a one time thing: for Jakob to have his hat company, and for the hats to be a reminder of the mental health struggles we all experience. I wore my hat whenever I could, and put the tag in my wallet. With that, I bid my friend goodbye and moved back to Vancouver later that year.</p><p>Over a year later, in October 2016 my close friend and masters thesis partner, Philipp Altenburg decided to move out to Vancouver. I’ve never spent more time with a single person in my life than with Philipp during our studies. We wrote our thesis together on “How improv theatre can use interpersonal communication skills to improve collaboration.” Philipp loved improv theatre. He could talk about it for hours. There were several occasions when I would have to tell him that most people will likely stop caring about improv after a few minutes – and that this was probably one of the reasons why women would move from sitting beside us when we were out.</p><p>For six months, day in and day out, Philipp and I worked together on our thesis. Near the end, we would be spending close to 15 hours a day with each other. And when he moved to Vancouver, Philipp wanted to pursue – you guessed it – improv. Philipp truly believed it could break down barriers to communication, and provide others with so much joy.</p><p>After a few months in Vancouver, Philipp was struggling with visa issues, and had to move back to Berlin. We would have weekly Skype calls, where each of us would pick an issue or topic that we found inspiring and discuss it. On one of our morning calls, I asked how he was doing. I expected to hear the usual: “good.” But what came out of his mouth was something different.</p><p>“I am struggling a bit. But I’ll be fine,” he said.</p><p>He quickly wanted to move onto talking about our weekly topic. Instead, we spent the next hour talking about how he had been struggling with feelings of isolation and depression since his move back to Berlin.</p><p>After that call, Philipp and I talked almost every day. He continued to struggle, but never appeared to be in crisis. He talked with other close friends in Berlin too, and was encouraged go talk to a professional, but he said he would when he got a job and could get the costs covered by insurance.</p><p>After some time, Philipp seemed to be turning over a new leaf. He found a job and felt like he was beginning to understand what he was going through.</p><p>Things seemed optimistic, at least from the outside.</p><p>Philipp and I went a few weeks without chatting. I had been away for July 1st, Canada Day weekend and didn’t have cell service for those few days. When I arrived back home, it was late on a Monday and I received a message from another one of Philipp’s best friends.</p><p>“Do you have time to talk?” Right away, something didn’t feel right.</p><p>I waited anxiously by my computer until he woke up. During that time, I desperately tried to reach out to Philipp, to hear anything at all from him. When my friend called, I knew before he even said the words. I burst into tears and screamed louder than I ever have before.</p><p>On July 1st, 2017, Philipp Altenburg took his life.</p><p>As I write these words, I still have tears that run down my face.</p><p>Philipp’s death shook me to my core. Never in my wildest dreams did I ever imagine he would take his life. Endless questions raced through my mind: How long had he been feeling this way? How deep was his suffering? Had it always been there? Why had I never asked? Did he think he couldn’t tell me? What did I need to do? These are all questions I will never have answers to. I couldn’t believe my friend was gone, but more shocking was how it happened.</p><p>Weeks later, a mutual friend of mine and Philipp’s reached out and asked if by any chance I had any more WIRTH Hats. He said he would really love to have one if I did, because it served as a good reminder of the realness of mental health.</p><p>That message stayed with me for several months, as both Philipp’s and Jakob’s passing consumed my thoughts alongside the larger epidemic of suicide, and the cultural and societal stigmas that surround it.</p><p>I thought of all the times I’d been down and out, feeling alone and isolated – yet never willing or wanting to share. My view of vulnerability was that it was weakness, and why would I burden others with issues of my own? A feeling that may be familiar to many. With all of this, I decided I would put WIRTH Hats into the world again – a symbol for a conversation, a reminder that we need to be more open and vulnerable with each other, and a promise to a friend to make the best hat company I could.</p><p>Since the launch of Wirth Hats in May 2018, we’ve hosted pop-ups at Patagonia and Sitka in Vancouver, Banded Peak Brewing in Calgary and Hooha Store in Copenhagen. In just five months, it’s already been a journey filled with amazing, sad, enlightening and eye-opening conversations. We’ve heard stories of people being on a ferry and knocking on stranger’s windows, just to show them they also have a Wirth Hat. Sometimes, I can’t help but wonder how perfect and fitting the name WIRTH is for this cause. Even through the sadness, there’s a part of me that feels like maybe this was Jakob’s gift to the world.</p><p>I truly believe that if WIRTH can help even one person, it will all be worth it. You can’t put a price on life, and that’s something I am willing to dedicate mine to.</p><p>It’s my dream for everyone in the world to own a WIRTH Hat, but more importantly, I want everyone to own what a WIRTH Hat represents. If we can get to a point where we treat our mental health the same as we do our physical health, I know the world will be in a much better place.</p><p>When we hold things in, they can come out in other ways. In both Jakob and Phillip’s case, neither sought professional help – which is painful to think about now – but unfortunately, it’s a common trend.</p><p>We must break this taboo. We all need someone to talk to who isn’t just a friend – an impartial professional who is there to listen, to let us know we are not alone and to help us make sense of what we are feeling and experiencing. This goes for when we are on top of the world, hitting rock bottom, and everywhere in between.</p><p>We have work to do to make counselling and therapy accessible for all, but more importantly, making it normal for all.</p><p>Forty years ago, if someone went for a run, it wasn’t normal. How things can change. My hope is that going to see a counsellor, therapist, psychiatrist, etc etc, will be the new normal over the next 10 years. Hopefully, even sooner than that.</p><p>I have one last story to share from our early journey, during our first pop-up shop at Patagonia, I was sharing the WIRTH story with a young man. As I was speaking, he was closely examining all the details of the hats. Then, all of a sudden, he stopped me mid-sentence and said, “Dude, I get it. It’s a hug for your head! Say no more!”. He then carried on to purchase several WIRTH Hats for his friends and family.</p><p>Thank you for reading our story!</p><p>Yours,</p><p><strong>The WIRTH Hats Team</strong></p><p>Ben, Alexa, Natalie, Alexandra, Zafira, Aili, Sarah, Julie, Josh, Jay, Adam, Kody, Joe, Michael, Anthony, Alexander &amp; Chad</p><p><i><strong>Please follow us and share your story!</strong></i></p><p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/WirthHats/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/WirthHats/</a><br/><a href=""https://twitter.com/WirthHats"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://twitter.com/WirthHats</a><br/><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/wirthhats"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.instagram.com/wirthhats</a><br/><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/company/wirthhats/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.linkedin.com/company/wirthhats/</a><br/><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN9rOnxwwNLi_Rxs0vLer_Q"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN9rOnxwwNLi_Rxs0vLer_Q</a></p><p>WIRTH Hats, a symbol for conversation. #hugforyourhead #wirthit</p></div>","This campaign will allow us to launch our #1for1 initiative by raising  the capital needed to reduce wholesale costs.

We are more than happy to help you.  </i></p><p><strong>MIZU NASHI</strong></p><p>Mizu Nashi is a streetwear brand founded in February 2020 by three young entrepreneurs who find their roots in various parts of the world, coming together in the Netherlands. Trying to make an impact on society we have created Mizu Nashi, <strong>durable streetwear inspired by society.</strong> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1592662525/nlrqyymbjbq0ygo1cl5e.jpg"" src=""""/><br/> </p><p>The original idea behind the brand was to make sustainable rainwear and with that in mind it may be helpful to know that Mizu Nashi means 'No Water' in Japanese. Unfortunately we were forced to change course due to the COVID-19 outbreak worldwide together with all the factories which were shut down as a result. From that moment on we have been focussing on making regular streetwear apparel with different social themes each collection, as displayed in our Indiegogo campaign.</p><h3><i>The Ode to Healthcare collection</i></h3><p>The first collection is inspired by the current worldwide COVID-19 crisis where we focus on healthcare. In this collection the colour palette is inspired by the colours that healthcare workers from all over the world are wearing in hospitals. We use blue, white and grey in our designs. It may not be forgotten that healthcare workers put their life on the line to help others in need for the past six months, today and in the future, especially during this COVID-19 crisis for the months or maybe years ahead. Healthcare workers are always there for their patients, work hard and deserve acknowledgement for what they do. That's why we created the <i>Ode to Healthcare </i>collection. Mizu Nashi donates 15% of the profits from the <i>Ode to Healthcare </i>collection to <strong>Medecins sans frontieres </strong>(<a href=""https://www.msf.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.msf.org/</a>). For those who don't know this organization, <strong>Medecins sans frontieres</strong> is an organization that brings medical humanitarian assistance to victims of conflict, natural disasters, epidemics or healthcare exclusion. The work they do is of huge importance and we are glad to support their projects.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1592245168/ftg3udomgizmlxohujvz.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1592662583/gayhkyslfxsnrjkekwog.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>The <i>Ode to Healthcare </i>collection contains the <i>Care Package </i>which consists of one or more items by your choice:<br/>- <strong>Liner vest -</strong> this is a vest which can be worn independently as an extra layer over your longsleeve, t-shirt or hoodie. The vest is made out of Taslan. Taslan is a modern, high-tech, woven polyester fabric which is <strong>water repellent</strong>.<br/><i>We are planning to create a rain jacket later this year, the liner vest can be zipped into this rain jacket which makes it a warm, not seasonal rain jacket.</i><br/>- <strong>Hoodie - </strong>The hoodie is very comfy and made out of 100% cotton. <br/>- <strong>Longsleeve -</strong> The longsleeve is made out of 100% cotton with a comfortable regular fit.<br/>- <strong>T-shirt</strong> - The T-shirt is also made out of 100% cotton with a comfortable regular fit.<br/><strong>- Facemask </strong>- The Mizu Nashi facemask is a <strong>non-medical</strong> facemask which is made out of Taslan and is <strong>water repellent</strong>. The facemask comes with a slit in which you can slot a <strong>filter</strong> in.</p><p>From here on we want make a greater story and start building the Mizu Nashi community through all our channels with you, the most important character in the story.

We are more than happy to help you.  MIZU NASHIMizu Nashi is a streetwear brand founded in February 2020 by three young entrepreneurs who find their roots in various parts of the world, coming together in the Netherlands. Trying to make an impact on society we have created Mizu Nashi, durable streetwear inspired by society.  The original idea behind the brand was to make sustainable rainwear and with that in mind it may be helpful to know that Mizu Nashi means 'No Water' in Japanese. Unfortunately we were forced to change course due to the COVID-19 outbreak worldwide together with all the factories which were shut down as a result. From that moment on we have been focussing on making regular streetwear apparel with different social themes each collection, as displayed in our Indiegogo campaign.The Ode to Healthcare collectionThe first collection is inspired by the current worldwide COVID-19 crisis where we focus on healthcare. In this collection the colour palette is inspired by the colours that healthcare workers from all over the world are wearing in hospitals. We use blue, white and grey in our designs. It may not be forgotten that healthcare workers put their life on the line to help others in need for the past six months, today and in the future, especially during this COVID-19 crisis for the months or maybe years ahead. Healthcare workers are always there for their patients, work hard and deserve acknowledgement for what they do. That's why we created the Ode to Healthcare collection. Mizu Nashi donates 15% of the profits from the Ode to Healthcare collection to Medecins sans frontieres (https://www.msf.org/). For those who don't know this organization, Medecins sans frontieres is an organization that brings medical humanitarian assistance to victims of conflict, natural disasters, epidemics or healthcare exclusion. The work they do is of huge importance and we are glad to support their projects. The Ode to Healthcare collection contains the Care Package which consists of one or more items by your choice:- Liner vest - this is a vest which can be worn independently as an extra layer over your longsleeve, t-shirt or hoodie. The vest is made out of Taslan. Taslan is a modern, high-tech, woven polyester fabric which is water repellent.We are planning to create a rain jacket later this year, the liner vest can be zipped into this rain jacket which makes it a warm, not seasonal rain jacket.- Hoodie - The hoodie is very comfy and made out of 100% cotton. - Longsleeve - The longsleeve is made out of 100% cotton with a comfortable regular fit.- T-shirt - The T-shirt is also made out of 100% cotton with a comfortable regular fit.- Facemask - The Mizu Nashi facemask is a non-medical facemask which is made out of Taslan and is water repellent. The facemask comes with a slit in which you can slot a filter in.From here on we want make a greater story and start building the Mizu Nashi community through all our channels with you, the most important character in the story. We are aiming for sustainable business operations in 2021 where we will produce our apparel from our very own fabrics. This will require development and development is a valuable thing. This is why we need your help by contributing to our campaign.We want to take you on our journey through the coming years, will you hop on the bus with us?  What We Need & What You GetLet's break it down real quick and clear to you. Our cost estimate amounts to roughly €4000. Our biggest expense will be the protection of our brandname which will cost up to €2000 for 10 years. The rest of it will go to the costs of production, marketing, development, patterns, photographers and videographers, web domain and maintenance for example.For the backers of our campaign we have created a few very exclusive perks, consisting of....:Perk 1:FacemaskPerk 2:Facemask (for free)T-shirtPerk 3:Facemask (for free)LongsleevePerk 4:Facemask (for free)HoodiePerk 5:Facemask (for free)LongsleeveT-shirtPerk 5:Facemask (for free)HoodieLongsleevePerk 7:Facemask (for free)Liner vestPerk 8:Facemask (for free)VestLongsleeveT-shirtPerk 9:2x Facemask (for free)VestHoodieLongsleeveT-shirtAs you can see there's basically something for everyone, so we're hoping there's also something for you! What if we do not reach our goal?When we do not reach our goal, we will still invest everything we did receive in the aforementioned aspects. All the backers will get the products they have paid for.The ImpactWe at Mizu Nashi believe that the fashion industry has the power to make a huge impact and change things for the better for everyone involved. To make the industry but also the world more sustainable, fair, equal and more aware of certain topics. To educate people but also to learn from the people.

Any repairs or replacement of affected parts will be at minimal downtime.Japanese craftsmanship has always been well respected in the handcrafted leather industry especially with the craft of hemming and stitching. This is because it is their way of life as they commit themselves as artisans and continuously improve on their crafting skills.Belt Kurenai and Siru involves the edge sealing process.Leather edge sealing refers to the process of creating a sealed smooth edge along the exposed seams. Several steps include sanding, coating, burnishing and finally, buffing. These procedures will be repeated until the edge appears smooth and delicate.It is the attention to details which the Japanese craftsmen pride themselves on. Their handmade products, especially, are well sought after as the consumers know for a fact that a certain standard will be delivered through the heart and soul of the artisan. Therefore, from the craftsman's skills, it can be said that a kind of unspeakable ""life"" is produced by the interaction between craftsman and material when making objects. Leading some to believe that hand-made objects in Japan, in addition to their form and function, are believed to have a “soul”.In Japanese craftsmanship, they believe that through repeated polishing, it brings life into the product. This is something that cannot be replaced with machine processes. Wax is manually applied repeatedly to seal the edges of the leather strap. Not only will it create a polished look of the leather, it prolongs the life of the strap as well. As compared to applying glue, wax will not only reduce the chance of the leather splitting sooner, but it also protects the leather by creating a layer over it.The colour of the leather will change over time due to interaction with the environment and body oil, giving it a personalised and unique touch. However, with the layers of wax skillfully applied over the leather, the core material will not be damaged. Sharing the same concept of Wabi-Sabi, as with the bronze case that we provide.We provide the sewing and bulging for both belt Kurenai and belt Siru.In addition, the saddle-stitching method will be used. It involves sewing with needles and threads which creates two rows of stitching in one single row of holes, and this process can only be achieved through skilled craftsmanship.By adopting this method of handmade stitching instead of machine stitching, it ensures that the leather strap can last much longer as two independent threads are being used. If a thread breaks, the saddle stitch will still hold the leather together.As for belt Kurenai and belt Siru, the suture of the strap is being hand sewn using Japanese hemp thread and finally sealing it off with beeswax.

Style Is Serene. What is style to you? Style can be funky. Your style can be sophisticated. S.I.S. Clothing is all about what style is to you and what it has the capacity to transform into. 
Ask yourself:



What does style mean to me? 


Does my style express who I am as a person?


What could my style be in the future?


S.I.S. Clothing wants you to be inspired by what you wear and let your outfits give you the drive needed to accomplish the things you care about. We just need a little bit of help from you first. 



What We Need & What You Get
Style Is Serene is expanding and wants to build a new image of itself. The money
donated will go towards:



High quality textiles and fabrics to create the very best pieces for you


Advertising to increase brand awareness to teach more people how to discover their own special style and spread the message


Manufacturing to keep costs low in order to appeal to more of our fans and keep your wallet happy!

(Designer & Owner-Gregory Richards on right)
For years now, it has been Greg's dream to make his clothing line successful. He's put the hard work in already: the pattern-making, the design, & the execution. Now, he just needs the funds for S.I.S. to really take off! S.I.S. has been alive since Greg's high school days, but it has been missing something to appeal to the mass market.

</div><div>The watches look quite unique already, so to add the extra uniqueness bit, every single watch will be engraved with a unique serial number and will come together with a certificate to prove that you are the only person owning the gorgeous watch with exactly that serial number. To keep it all in control only 100 pieces of each watch will be made. Makes it even more desirable, huh? Extra uniqueness will be added with the Certificate of Authenticity for each watch, making sure you have the original NinetyTwo watch and no cheap copycat.</div><div><br/></div><div>
<h1>Sales &amp; Marketing:</h1>
<p>As advertising something classic is just as hard as advertising something unique, I will put all of my best effort to get this project rolling as good as I can. The huge webs of social networks is the best place where to look for fans and potential clients, so that's where I will focus in the beginning of this business.</p>
<p>I've done some research on what people like, which watches are the favourite, and I am getting a brief idea of which way to move the business for it to be successful once I've got the funding. Active Facebook and Twitter accounts is a key to deliver the message to as many people as I can, therefore I'm actively updating statuses all the time, to update NinetyTwo fans as much as I can, making the campaign and brand more visible to the whole world!</p>
<p>The Facebook page is already up and running, so is the Twitter profile and the webpage, found here, as follows:</p>

<p>Pre-order offers and other discount and offer option are also in my mind for future sales boosting and marketing.</p>
<p>Many of you might think ""Why does this guy need ten thousand pounds to start it up?""...</p>
<p>Here's that part where I tell what the funding is needed for. As a part-time working Uni student it is obvious I don't have spare eight grand lying around my account, that' why the funds will be spent on this:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Making first physical samples. I guess you all noticed that the pictures are only design propositions derived from the manufacturer's pictures. That's because I am sharing an idea here and not so much promoting an actual product as most of projects. That's why I've put this up as flexible funding - the first funds will go directly to get physical samples, and therefore being able to show you guys the actual quality of the product.</li>
<li>Ordering first batches for each watch design. Only 100 watches will be available for each design to keep it unique for starters, I will order 5 designs, not including the bamboo Eco watches. To get the best quality watches I obviously can't take any cheap offers from manufacturers as they most likely won't last.</li>
<li>Advertising on social networks. Many people don't even realize how huge and expensive is the social network advertising campaign business. To reach out to the target audiences it is not anymore enough with some clicks on links and shares on Facebook, it requires greatly designed Ads and post boosts to target audiences.</li>
<li>Developing upcoming design series for the future. There's no use of making a new watch company to just make one batch of watches, that's why I'm looking towards the future and no-one's going to design new watches for free.</li>
<li>Shipping costs to early-bird watch buyers - obviously, I will need some sum to deliver the perks I offer to the people who want them, that's why the perks will only be delivered once a particular sum has been reached, in this case - 10% of the whole sum.</li>
<li>Up-keeping costs of the website, storage and moving around to deliver the goods to delivery companies.</li>
<li>Filming and photographing for the advertisements.And other small bits, which are still important to keep you guys entertained and up-to-date with what's going on with the project.</li>
</ul>

<p>I already have loads of different ideas in my mind, and I will do everything that's needed to make it all happen. Most of my future plans have already been told in the text above, so I won't repeat myself. More design lines to be added in the process of the campaign rising, therefore remember to check back once in a while to see what great things have happened!</p>

</div><p></p><h3>Risks and challenges</h3><p>There's always risk in business and showing off something new - but that's what keeps me motivated to make it happen, the fact, that it is not always easy makes it a better challenge for me. <br/>The biggest obstacles will most likely be with selling and delivering goods. I am not saying there are no other obstacles possible, but most of them are so tiny, that I wouldn't even call them obstacles.</p><p><br/></p><p>Funding:<br/>Obviously, the risk with Flexible funding is that I could fail to meet the funding goal, therefore raising concerns in contributors who decide to buy the watches using the perks. Therefore I am now clarifying, that even if the goal is not met the watches WILL be delivered to the ones who want them, even if it will ask to sacrifice my own funds. I am here to boost a business and I know that care about my costumers is the key to being successful and known!</p><p>Sales:</p><p>With sales there's always a possibility that something could go wrong. Fortunately, as a Business Management student I have been taught, how to tackle tricky situations in the case of little amount of costumers and other problems. I've done enough market researches to understand, that my product will be quite unique and don't have any big competitors at this time. Attracting customers might be the hardest part of the ""game"", but as we all know, high quality, good name and active marketing will help out with that. And obviously - the product is the biggest advertisement there is.</p><p>Delivery: <br/>As there are many third-party obstacles, such as environmental problems, bad weather etc., not all of them may be controllable from my side, but if any of these arise, I will always look for any possible ways how to fix the occurred problems. <br/>Every delivery of the watches will be insured, making sure that both the buyer/receiver and the creator/seller are safe from potential theft or damage during the deliveries. Extra customs fees might occur, and most likely they should be tackled by the buyer, unfortunately. If anything like that occurs, please contact me immediately.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">There is no problem one couldn't tackle with, therefore I am keeping a positive look at everything in life, and consider any obstacles as a new challenge for me to prove what I can do.

The watches look quite unique already, so to add the extra uniqueness bit, every single watch will be engraved with a unique serial number and will come together with a certificate to prove that you are the only person owning the gorgeous watch with exactly that serial number. To keep it all in control only 100 pieces of each watch will be made. Makes it even more desirable, huh? Extra uniqueness will be added with the Certificate of Authenticity for each watch, making sure you have the original NinetyTwo watch and no cheap copycat.
Sales & Marketing:
As advertising something classic is just as hard as advertising something unique, I will put all of my best effort to get this project rolling as good as I can. The huge webs of social networks is the best place where to look for fans and potential clients, so that's where I will focus in the beginning of this business.
I've done some research on what people like, which watches are the favourite, and I am getting a brief idea of which way to move the business for it to be successful once I've got the funding. Active Facebook and Twitter accounts is a key to deliver the message to as many people as I can, therefore I'm actively updating statuses all the time, to update NinetyTwo fans as much as I can, making the campaign and brand more visible to the whole world!
The Facebook page is already up and running, so is the Twitter profile and the webpage, found here, as follows:
http://www.ninetytwowatches.co.uk 

  http://www.facebook.com/NinetyTwoWatches
 http://www.twitter.com/92_Watches
Pre-order offers and other discount and offer option are also in my mind for future sales boosting and marketing.
Many of you might think ""Why does this guy need ten thousand pounds to start it up?""...
Here's that part where I tell what the funding is needed for. As a part-time working Uni student it is obvious I don't have spare eight grand lying around my account, that' why the funds will be spent on this:


Making first physical samples. I guess you all noticed that the pictures are only design propositions derived from the manufacturer's pictures. That's because I am sharing an idea here and not so much promoting an actual product as most of projects. That's why I've put this up as flexible funding - the first funds will go directly to get physical samples, and therefore being able to show you guys the actual quality of the product.
Ordering first batches for each watch design. Only 100 watches will be available for each design to keep it unique for starters, I will order 5 designs, not including the bamboo Eco watches. To get the best quality watches I obviously can't take any cheap offers from manufacturers as they most likely won't last.
Advertising on social networks. Many people don't even realize how huge and expensive is the social network advertising campaign business. To reach out to the target audiences it is not anymore enough with some clicks on links and shares on Facebook, it requires greatly designed Ads and post boosts to target audiences.
Developing upcoming design series for the future. There's no use of making a new watch company to just make one batch of watches, that's why I'm looking towards the future and no-one's going to design new watches for free.
Shipping costs to early-bird watch buyers - obviously, I will need some sum to deliver the perks I offer to the people who want them, that's why the perks will only be delivered once a particular sum has been reached, in this case - 10% of the whole sum.
Up-keeping costs of the website, storage and moving around to deliver the goods to delivery companies.
Filming and photographing for the advertisements.And other small bits, which are still important to keep you guys entertained and up-to-date with what's going on with the project.






Future related stuff:

As I already explained above, this is not a one-time project, but something that I'm trying to build to last for a long time, to become a known name in the watch-lover community and to known for it's good quality and unique designs.
I already have loads of different ideas in my mind, and I will do everything that's needed to make it all happen. Most of my future plans have already been told in the text above, so I won't repeat myself. More design lines to be added in the process of the campaign rising, therefore remember to check back once in a while to see what great things have happened!
Thanks for looking at my idea, and I hope it did communicate with you in a good way! 
Even if you don't want to contribute financially, or simply just can't do that, you can still Like the Facebook page, follow on Twitter and visit the homepage once in a while to see what's going on with the project.


Risks and challengesThere's always risk in business and showing off something new - but that's what keeps me motivated to make it happen, the fact, that it is not always easy makes it a better challenge for me. The biggest obstacles will most likely be with selling and delivering goods. I am not saying there are no other obstacles possible, but most of them are so tiny, that I wouldn't even call them obstacles.Funding:Obviously, the risk with Flexible funding is that I could fail to meet the funding goal, therefore raising concerns in contributors who decide to buy the watches using the perks. Therefore I am now clarifying, that even if the goal is not met the watches WILL be delivered to the ones who want them, even if it will ask to sacrifice my own funds. I am here to boost a business and I know that care about my costumers is the key to being successful and known!Sales:With sales there's always a possibility that something could go wrong. Fortunately, as a Business Management student I have been taught, how to tackle tricky situations in the case of little amount of costumers and other problems. I've done enough market researches to understand, that my product will be quite unique and don't have any big competitors at this time. Attracting customers might be the hardest part of the ""game"", but as we all know, high quality, good name and active marketing will help out with that. And obviously - the product is the biggest advertisement there is.Delivery: As there are many third-party obstacles, such as environmental problems, bad weather etc., not all of them may be controllable from my side, but if any of these arise, I will always look for any possible ways how to fix the occurred problems. Every delivery of the watches will be insured, making sure that both the buyer/receiver and the creator/seller are safe from potential theft or damage during the deliveries. Extra customs fees might occur, and most likely they should be tackled by the buyer, unfortunately. If anything like that occurs, please contact me immediately.There is no problem one couldn't tackle with, therefore I am keeping a positive look at everything in life, and consider any obstacles as a new challenge for me to prove what I can do. I'll keep my fingers crossed everything works as it should and will do the most to tackle with all of it anyway.",11.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<li>
<b>Online store production and making an online presence</b>: Because of my background of being a photographer, designer, and pretty much living in the internet for most of my time,  I've figured out how to work my way around productions on a low budget as a one-man team. But to promote this brand new line, TPHR Apparel is going to have to put a bit more emphasis on making sure the store, multimedia promotions (video and photo ads, social media, etc.), and presence gets more resources than what gets usually put in.</li>

Like mentioned before, TPHR Apparel's strives to leave behind a positive message through our products. To share that positive message with the community, we will give back a portion of each collection's earnings to a charity or non-profit that we believe deserves help.As an up-and-coming establishment, we are open for collaborations big or small. So if you are running a non-profit that is interested in working with us, please feel free to contact us at http://topheroriel.com/contact

As a young establishment, it's sometimes difficult for us to get our foot in some doors, but we believe that Indiegogo is an awesome way to raise awareness of the line and get more people interested worldwide. The requested $3,000 for this campaign will not only help jumpstart the apparel by producing the shirts and help build a foundation, but it will also support future endeavors of working with other designers to make more diverse and unique collections in the future. We are excited how TPHR Apparel can springboard from crowdfunding and reach new heights.





There are two main things that the money raised will go into:



Getting the shirts printed and ready: Both getting the shirts and getting them printed is going to be the main category  the money will go to. Because of this category taking up over 75% of the overall funds, it is a high priority just to get the apparel out there.

Online store production and making an online presence: Because of my background of being a photographer, designer, and pretty much living in the internet for most of my time,  I've figured out how to work my way around productions on a low budget as a one-man team. But to promote this brand new line, TPHR Apparel is going to have to put a bit more emphasis on making sure the store, multimedia promotions (video and photo ads, social media, etc.), and presence gets more resources than what gets usually put in.




Once the campaign starts, there will be multiple events to promote TPHR Apparel during and after the campaign.



Tuesday, June 2nd, 2015: Start of the campaign.

Friday, June 12th, 2015: 6-hour promotional livestream for the campaign on Twitch.
Friday, July 31st, 2015: 12-hour livestream on Twitch to promote the last day of the campaign.
Saturday, August 1st, 2015: End of Campaign.
Wednesday, September 30th, 2015: Perks will be shipped.
Saturday, October 3rd, 2015: Grand opening of TPHR Apparel at the Topher Oriel art gallery/concert in Fullerton, CA.







The Indiegogo exclusive card


UPDATE (June 6th - 8th): Any backer that contributes between this Saturday and Monday will receive a bonus sticker/button package with their perk. After Monday, this perk will be available separately and in a shirt package!




$4,000+: Beanies. TPHR Apparel will make a limited run of the logo made on beanies.
$5,000+: Hoodies. TPHR Apparel will do a limited run on all 2 designs printed on hoodies.
$6,000+: 24-hour livestream. If we can double the amount raised by the end of the campaign, I will dedicate a day to hang out to thank you on Twitch.



CROWDSHARING is CROWDFUNDING. 

Choose a perk & show your support! We tried to make the perks for this campaign as much fun for everyone. The more backing goes into the campaign, the more exposure this can get by sharing. This is the best option for if you are not in the best shape for finances right now (please make sure to support your well-being before anything else). Every voice counts.Please share this project on other social media platforms throughout the campaign and let people know about this! Tag @topheroriel when you share this since I will be looking out on various platforms. Some people who share the TPHR Apparel Indiegogo could have a special surprise when their perk gets shipped to them (aka, get some more free goodies).""Your support means the world to me in this new adventure. Your name will be forever embedded in my heart and we'll give you a thank you shout-out on a dedicated section on the TPHR Apparel website in recognition for the campaign."" -Topher Oriel

<h3>THE STORY</h3>
<p>Tosha and I are co-founders of Liv2BGirl, a social mobile platform where girls are inspired and rewarded to <b><i>Spread the Love </i>and <i>Stop the Hate!</i></b>
</p>
<p>Many businesses are inspired by a passion and Liv2BGirl is no different. In 2011, when Facebook was the place to be for tweens and teens, we saw the issues immediately. Social pressures are part of your world even when you leave school. </p>
<p>As co-founders, neighbors and friends, Tosha and I wanted something different for our girls. We embarked on a journey to create a positive place where girls felt comfortable being individuals. Here are the highlights:</p>

</li>
<li><span>Created merchandise to raise brand awareness.</span></li>
<li>

</li>
<li>

<li>
<span>Girls spent an average of 30 plus minutes on the site daily.</span><br/>

At the moment, our studio in Milan handles the design phase  and the final hand assembly.That means that there are many steps in between that are located far away – which adds to logistics expenses.


               





                



     













We take great pride in making top quality jewelry by using only the best materials, techniques and most authentic methods.

   


The pieces are crafted under a rigorous, detail-oriented process, which requires great finesse to achieve a balance of forms. 


  
 


Only certified and superior materials are used: Swarovski Crystals, symbol of glamour and elegance, and precious soft pearls, symbol of timeless femininity, combined with precious and semi-precious metals. (24k gold, 18k. rose gold, ruthenium and palladium.)


  



All materials are nickel/lead free and hypoallergenic making them suitable for sensitive skin.


  




             


     
                  




      


          


      

-Less is more. Stick to one statement piece per outfit. This will allow your piece to stand out like it’s supposed to. 
  
 
-Choose your earrings wisely. Statement earrings are eye-catching and they should suit your face shape and hair. Choose the right earrings according to length, color, and shape and make sure they suit your features, hairstyle and outfit.
   
  


-Keeping it simple. When wearing a big piece, tone down your outfit with simple clothes, neutral and block color pieces and don’t mix it up with busy patterns and sparkly clothing.        


  

-Match the necklace to the neckline. Strapless, off-shoulder, scoop or v-necklines are easy to match a statement piece. Collars and halter necks are difficult but work well if they are in neutral and block colors so that they emphasize your piece.    

  
-Statement pieces ARE the outfit. Statement pieces are designed to make a statement so let them speak for the rest of your outfit. Choose your overall style then choose your statement piece which boasts that style.

ETEAQ’s designs are characterized by the use of reclaimed Indonesian teak wood coming from old Javanese houses and prized for its strength and beauty, creating a fantastic one-of-a-kind story for each piece. This beautifully aged teak wood, many which are 30 years old, contain less moisture than new woods, which means that they have better durability and water resistance. 








For tree planting, ETEAQ partners with Trees4Trees, a non-profit foundation dedicated to reforestation efforts throughout Indonesia. Trees4Trees works with over 14,000 farmers.

<h3>Our Story a.k.a. Who we really are</h3> <p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We are a new brand of underwear
called MASZARYK and with our products, we literally want to connect countries that are
currently in tense relationships.  </p>
<p>Instead of taking down our enemies, we should
take down our partners‘ underwear. Much more pleasure in that, don't you think.</p>
<p>And this is why you can find in one underwear
pack, one pair of underwear in Ukraine theme for you and another
one in Russian theme for your partner in our releasing collection.</p>
<p>Underwear is very intimate, it gets to our
very skin. By taking off underwear represetning a country flag, we free
ourselves and become naked. We become those people we were when we were born,
without a nationality that was given to us afterwards. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465748978/Rusko_damske_ohglzz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The purchase of Maszaryk underwear is a choice
for people in this very description. We want to break the stereotypes. (Not only by design in underwear industry but we also want to show that you and we care
about the presence of tension or war between two countries. Information on the exact amounts of underwear sold will be freely available to everyone, therefore even politicans will be able to see that people can love each other even with national boundaries.</p>

Our brand Maszaryk comes from Masaryk – the first
Czech-Slovak president who joined up two nations without the use of any guns.
This very fact in the history of these two nations is extremely important and
we believe that it should also become known world-wide. We would like to
breathe life into this historical element and bring hope and belief to people,
to let them realise nations shouldn’t need to fight. They can love each
other. Maszaryk underwear expresses this idea via the product design, where
these fighting countries are symbolically brought together.

The foundation of the brand as well as the whole production process are based in Czechoslovakia. Materials used for our products are sourced from high-quality local producers and are processed by various small entrepreneurs, all within Czech and Slovak Republics. Therefore, this brand recreates now extinct label – Made in Czechoslovakia.  </div><div>

you our funds today. You will get interchangeable refund and contract, which
will be exchanged for Maszaryk’s funds in value of 500€ for 300€ perk and 800€ for 500€ perk.


Perk for 1000€ 
This great perk and unique peace of underwear will be created for two of you and presidents of Russian federation and Ukraine (you can choose one option), who will get a piece of their ""friendly neighbor"".

The Impact we try to reach - 1 step a time
With your help we want to establish Maszaryk non-governmental organization in future, where certain percentage of money are going to be used from your purchased set of our underwear. This will in turn be used to connect and eliminate prejudice between the countries featured in the purchased set. 


We are trying to make a big impact in the fashion industry by supporting domestic manufacturing and therefore, all garments and other parts are made in the Czechoslovakia.  Supporting domestic manufacturing helps create jobs and keeps money local.  

We want to be able to wear underwear which we
are proud of and has its purpose. 
Pure ideas generate high-quality products, and this is our target.

<div>Approximately two years ago Hubert came up with the idea of printing human rights on a T-shirt. However, we didn’t want to just print human rights on a T-shirt. We wanted to contribute something special to our society. So just printing the articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations on a T-shirt is nothing extraordinary, right!?</div>
<div>We have been on the lookout for designers for quite a while. Finally, we found DECASA – two sisters located in the Austrian city Graz. At the first meeting we immediately realized that something special was happening. They were enthusiastic about the idea of bringing human rights back to the heart of our society. Soon after the first meeting we got the first drafts of the paintings. After completing some modifications we drove up to Copenhagen to meet our producer. We have chosen Neutral®, because it is one of the leading firms in the sector of sustainable clothing. Their certificates are the guarantee that human rights of the workers are respected and that the T-shirt is produced with as little negative impact on our earth as possible.</div>

<div>We need the help of every single person to set the idea of human rights for ALL the people in motion. Spread the word and share the campaign with your friends and beloved ones on Facebook and Twitter. The more noise we can make the more human rights will come to the attention of a wider audience. Together with your help we can make the word a better place. </div>

<div style=""text-align: center;""><b>EXCHANGE POLICY</b></div>
<div>If you follow the sizing chart carefully, then the T-shirts should fit you just fine. Still, if you wish to exchange your TNI T-shirt for any reason, we’ll happily do that but you’ll have to pay for the two way shipping. As we are just starting up and offering our T-shirts at discounted prices, we won’t be able to accept returns. Please make sure the items are unworn and unwashed. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><b>FAQ</b></div>
<div>
<b>How do I specify the SIZE, STYLE and GRAPHIC of my TNI T-shirt?</b> We will ask for your preferred size, style and graphic at the end of the campaign via e-mail.</div>
<div>
<b>How do I specify my shipping address?</b> We will ask for your shipping address immediately when you order your TNI T-shirt on Indiegogo. </div>
<div>
<b>When will new colours/versions be available? </b>We have a ton of great ideas for visualising more rights, new colours and different styles and can't wait to make them available. A lot depends on how many we sell, so please tell all your friends to hit us up on Indiegogo!</div>
<div>
<b>When will I receive my TNI T-shirt? </b>As soon as the campaign is over we will start delivering your TNI T-shirt to you. Shipment will start in August 2016. </div>

<p>TNI ist die
Abkürzung für <b>T</b>ua <b>N</b>osce <b>I</b>ura, kommt aus dem Lateinischen
und bedeutet übersetzt: „Kenne deine Rechte!“</p>
<p>
Wir
sind eine junge Modemarke, die nachhaltige und fair produzierte T-Shirts für
Frauen und Männer kreiert. Dabei verbinden wir Mode und Kunst mit
Nachhaltigkeit. In Kooperation mit zwei Designerinnen aus Graz haben wir
Menschenrechte visualisiert, um wieder mehr Aufmerksamkeit für das Thema zu
schaffen.</p>
<p>
Wir
benötigen 25.000 EUR, um TNI T-Shirts in größerem Umfang zu produzieren und mit
unserer Idee mehr Menschen erreichen zu können. </p>
<p>
Durch
deine Unterstützung auf Indiegogo ermöglichst du uns, mehr Rechte zu
visualisieren und weitere Styles auf den Markt zu bringen.</p>

Setze
ein Zeichen, indem du die Idee von Menschenrechten mit deinem TNI T-Shirt in
die Welt hinausträgst!</div>

Meinungsfreiheit
ist ein umfassendes Recht. Neben dem Recht auf freie Meinungsäußerung
beinhaltet es auch, sich ohne Rücksicht auf Grenzen Informationen zu
beschaffen, zu empfangen und zu verbreiten und zwar über Medien jeder Art, egal
ob in Schrift, Wort oder Bild. Für uns stellt dieses Recht eines der
fundamentalsten in der Allgemeinen Erklärung der Menschenrechte dar, denn es erlaubt
uns, weitere Menschenrechte zu artikulieren. </p>

Das
Recht auf Privat- und Familienleben wird als Abwehrrecht gegenüber dem Staat
verstanden. Jedem soll die Möglichkeit gegeben werden, unbeobachtet und frei
von Überwachung zu leben. Durch dieses Recht erlangen wir persönliche
Autonomie. Vor allem im Zusammenhang mit den Abhörskandalen aus jüngster Zeit
und der Massenüberwachung, der wir tagtäglich ausgesetzt sind, denken wir, dass
es wichtig ist, dieses Menschenrecht wieder mehr in den Fokus der Gesellschaft
zu rücken.</p>

Vor
ungefähr zwei Jahren hatte Hubert die Idee, Artikel aus der Allgemeinen
Erklärung der Menschenrechte auf T-Shirts zu drucken. Wir waren der Meinung,
dass dies alleine noch nichts Besonderes sei und machten uns weiter Gedanken. Wir
wollten ein einzigartiges Produkt mit Mehrwert für unsere Gesellschaft schaffen.
In Graz sind wir auf die zwei Künstlerinnen Carola und Sabrina Deutsch gestoßen.
Die beiden Schwestern waren sofort von unserem Projekt begeistert und wollten unsere
Idee visualisieren. Wir machten uns also ans Werk und kreierten gemeinsam die
ersten Entwürfe. Nach einigen Anpassungen standen schon nach kurzer Zeit die
Grafiken für unsere TNI T-Shirts fest und Hubert und ich machten uns auf den
Weg zu unserem Produzenten nach Kopenhagen. Wir haben uns für das Unternehmen Neutral® entschieden, weil es eine der Top-Adressen für verantwortungsbewusste und
nachhaltige Textilproduktion ist. Die Zertifikate von Neutral® garantieren,
dass unsere T-Shirts mit der geringstmöglichen Belastung für unsere Erde
produziert wurden.<br/>

<p>Möglicherweise
sehen viele in unserer Gesellschaft Menschenrechte als etwas
Selbstverständliches an und sind sich der Gefahr nicht bewusst, dass wir im
Begriff sind, diese fundamentalen Rechte über Bord zu werfen. Genau diese
Gefahr wollen wir den Menschen vor Augen führen und wieder ein Bewusstsein für dieses wichtige

We are a young fashion brand, producing stylish and fairly produced T-shirts for ladies and gents. By combining art and fashion in a sustainable setting, with a strong desire for spotlighting human rights, we created the TNI T-shirt for a good cause.
We are aiming for 25.000 EUR in order to produce TNI T-shirts on a bigger scale and to reach a bigger audience.
By supporting us on Indiegogo you allow us to visualise more rights and to come up with more styles.
Take a stand for human rights by wearing your TNI T-shirt. 



Ladies loose fit TNI T-shirt



The ladies loose fit TNI T-shirt is perfect for all who like to wear casual and comfortable clothing. 

Available sizes: XS, S, M, L, XL.



Ladies fitted TNI T-shirt


The ladies fitted TNI T-shirt is a tight fitting stylish T-shirt. 
Available sizes: XS, S, M, L, XL. 


Gents TNI T-Shirt





The TNI T-shirt for gents is an eye-catcher and comfy to wear. 
Available sizes: S, M, L, XL, XXL. 









All TNI T-shirts have a handmade seam on the back. 

           




Very strict standards govern the production process of your TNI T-shirt to protect our environment and the people.

 
Your TNI T-shirt is made of 100 % organic
grown and fair trade certified cotton.
The SA8000 certificate
makes sure that the human rights of the workers producing your TNI T-shirt are
respected. 






The ""Made in Book"" is our way of being as transparent as possible. In the made in book the entire production process from start to finish is outlined. Moreover, the above-mentioned certificates are described in greater detail. To give you a taste we show you a short section of our made in book. 











100
% bio-degradable, stamped and individualized. 
Our packaging material is made out of sugar-cane molasses – a waste product of
sugar production. It is 100 % bio-degradable - the packaging can be thrown onto the
compost or in your bio-waste container. 










We are proudly announcing our official partnership with Amnesty International Austria!
10 % of our turnover will directly be donated to this organisation! 







A couple of facts why we think that human
rights are essential for a peaceful and dignified life for every one. 






All over the world people just like we are being tortured right now. Imagine being beaten, electrocuted, having your
face cut, having your fingernails pulled out.
A new global poll, commissioned by Amnesty
International, has revealed that 44 % of people around the world fear being
tortured in their own country.
                  






Freedom of expression can be understood as a
mulit-faceted right that includes not only the right to express, or
disseminate, information and ideas but also to seek, receive and impart them. For us freedom of expression is one of the fundamental pillar for human rights protection, because it allows us to articulate other human rights. 
                   






The right to privacy constitutes an essential defence against the state. Privacy creates a space separate from political life and gives us personal autonomy. We think that the current mass
surveillance is a needless violation of the rights of citizens around the
world.                         

                             

                         


TNI is a combination of art and fashion. We designed hand crafted frames which make every room look nicer. 

        
At the end of the campaign you will receive an e-mail in which you will be asked for your preferred graphic for your TNI frame.  


Approximately two years ago Hubert came up with the idea of printing human rights on a T-shirt. However, we didn’t want to just print human rights on a T-shirt. We wanted to contribute something special to our society. So just printing the articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations on a T-shirt is nothing extraordinary, right!?
We have been on the lookout for designers for quite a while. Finally, we found DECASA – two sisters located in the Austrian city Graz. At the first meeting we immediately realized that something special was happening. They were enthusiastic about the idea of bringing human rights back to the heart of our society. Soon after the first meeting we got the first drafts of the paintings. After completing some modifications we drove up to Copenhagen to meet our producer. We have chosen Neutral®, because it is one of the leading firms in the sector of sustainable clothing. Their certificates are the guarantee that human rights of the workers are respected and that the T-shirt is produced with as little negative impact on our earth as possible.




Summer 2014                        flash of inspiration                               

 Autumn 2014                     we found our designers                   



 Spring 2015                         we found our producer                 



 Winter 2015                               we ordered our                           First Production

Summer 2016                                  start on                                        


August 2016                                                                             DELIVERY




Obviously a risk for the fulfilment of our goal is that too many people take human rights for granted. 
However, with a well-thought-out approach we are sure that we can bring the idea of human rights closer to everyone. 
People like you are the reason we started this campaign because we know that a lot of others think the same way we do. Human rights are a benefit for all of us. Join us and minimise the risk of failing. 
In the case we will not reach our funding goal we will continue fighting for a world in which human rights are a reality for all of us.







We need the help of every single person to set the idea of human rights for ALL the people in motion. Spread the word and share the campaign with your friends and beloved ones on Facebook and Twitter. The more noise we can make the more human rights will come to the attention of a wider audience. Together with your help we can make the word a better place. 


EXCHANGE POLICY
If you follow the sizing chart carefully, then the T-shirts should fit you just fine. Still, if you wish to exchange your TNI T-shirt for any reason, we’ll happily do that but you’ll have to pay for the two way shipping. As we are just starting up and offering our T-shirts at discounted prices, we won’t be able to accept returns. Please make sure the items are unworn and unwashed. 

FAQ

How do I specify the SIZE, STYLE and GRAPHIC of my TNI T-shirt? We will ask for your preferred size, style and graphic at the end of the campaign via e-mail.

How do I specify my shipping address? We will ask for your shipping address immediately when you order your TNI T-shirt on Indiegogo. 

When will new colours/versions be available? We have a ton of great ideas for visualising more rights, new colours and different styles and can't wait to make them available. A lot depends on how many we sell, so please tell all your friends to hit us up on Indiegogo!

When will I receive my TNI T-shirt? As soon as the campaign is over we will start delivering your TNI T-shirt to you. Shipment will start in August 2016.

TNI ist die
Abkürzung für Tua Nosce Iura, kommt aus dem Lateinischen
und bedeutet übersetzt: „Kenne deine Rechte!“

Wir
sind eine junge Modemarke, die nachhaltige und fair produzierte T-Shirts für
Frauen und Männer kreiert. Dabei verbinden wir Mode und Kunst mit
Nachhaltigkeit. In Kooperation mit zwei Designerinnen aus Graz haben wir
Menschenrechte visualisiert, um wieder mehr Aufmerksamkeit für das Thema zu
schaffen.

Wir
benötigen 25.000 EUR, um TNI T-Shirts in größerem Umfang zu produzieren und mit
unserer Idee mehr Menschen erreichen zu können. 

Durch
deine Unterstützung auf Indiegogo ermöglichst du uns, mehr Rechte zu
visualisieren und weitere Styles auf den Markt zu bringen.

Setze
ein Zeichen, indem du die Idee von Menschenrechten mit deinem TNI T-Shirt in
die Welt hinausträgst!

auf Umwelt- und Sozialverträglichkeit. 
             


Dein TNI-Shirt
besteht zu 100 % aus biologisch angebauter und FAIRTRADE-zertifizierter

Das SA8000 Zertifikat
garantiert, dass die Menschenrechte der Arbeiter, die dein TNI T-shirt

Das
„Made in Book“ ist unser Weg so transparent als möglich zu sein. Darin zeigen
wir alle Produktionsschritte auf. Von der Baumwollerzeugung bis zum Schneidern.
Vom Design bis zum Bedrucken. Darüber hinaus werden die einzelnen Zertifikate
im Detail beschrieben. Einen kleinen Vorgeschmack gibt’s hier:








100
% biologisch-abbaubar, gestempelt und individualisiert. 



Unser
Verpackungsmaterial besteht aus Zuckerrohrmelasse, ein Abfallprodukt der
Zuckerproduktion.  


Wirf die
Verpackung ganz einfach in die Bio-Tonne oder auf den Kompost und hilf uns, die
Umwelt zu schonen!








Wir
sind stolz, unsere offizielle Partnerschaft mit Amnesty International
Österreich präsentieren zu dürfen. 

10 % des auf Indiegogo
erzielten Betrages fließen direkt an diese Organisation!





Einige
Fakten, warum wir davon überzeugt sind, dass die Einhaltung der Menschenrechte unerlässlich
für ein friedvolles und würdiges Leben für uns alle ist. 


Stell
dir vor, geschlagen, ausgepeitscht oder verstümmelt zu werden oder gar, dass
dir die Fingernägel gezogen werden! Auf der ganzen Welt sind Menschen wie du
und ich diesem Moment Opfer von solchen grausamen Foltermethoden.    


Eine
neue, von Amnesty International in Auftrag gegebene Studie hat gezeigt, dass 44
% der Menschen rund um den Globus in der Angst leben, gefoltert zu werden.
                 






Meinungsfreiheit
ist ein umfassendes Recht. Neben dem Recht auf freie Meinungsäußerung
beinhaltet es auch, sich ohne Rücksicht auf Grenzen Informationen zu
beschaffen, zu empfangen und zu verbreiten und zwar über Medien jeder Art, egal
ob in Schrift, Wort oder Bild. Für uns stellt dieses Recht eines der
fundamentalsten in der Allgemeinen Erklärung der Menschenrechte dar, denn es erlaubt
uns, weitere Menschenrechte zu artikulieren. 
                        






Das
Recht auf Privat- und Familienleben wird als Abwehrrecht gegenüber dem Staat
verstanden. Jedem soll die Möglichkeit gegeben werden, unbeobachtet und frei
von Überwachung zu leben. Durch dieses Recht erlangen wir persönliche
Autonomie. Vor allem im Zusammenhang mit den Abhörskandalen aus jüngster Zeit
und der Massenüberwachung, der wir tagtäglich ausgesetzt sind, denken wir, dass
es wichtig ist, dieses Menschenrecht wieder mehr in den Fokus der Gesellschaft
zu rücken.
                         




TNI
ist eine Kombination aus Kunst und Mode. Unsere handgemachten TNI-Rahmen sind Kunstwerke
und ein Highlight in jedem Raum. Die Grafik wird mit 30 Fäden von Hand
hineingespannt. Die Allgemeine Erklärung der Menschenrechte von 1948 umfasst 30
Artikel - jeder Faden repräsentiert ein Menschenrecht. 
                   


Am Ende der
Kampagne kontaktieren wir dich per Mail und du kannst uns bekanntgeben, mit welcher Grafik dein TNI Rahmen bespannt werden soll.




Vor
ungefähr zwei Jahren hatte Hubert die Idee, Artikel aus der Allgemeinen
Erklärung der Menschenrechte auf T-Shirts zu drucken. Wir waren der Meinung,
dass dies alleine noch nichts Besonderes sei und machten uns weiter Gedanken. Wir
wollten ein einzigartiges Produkt mit Mehrwert für unsere Gesellschaft schaffen.
In Graz sind wir auf die zwei Künstlerinnen Carola und Sabrina Deutsch gestoßen.
Die beiden Schwestern waren sofort von unserem Projekt begeistert und wollten unsere
Idee visualisieren. Wir machten uns also ans Werk und kreierten gemeinsam die
ersten Entwürfe. Nach einigen Anpassungen standen schon nach kurzer Zeit die
Grafiken für unsere TNI T-Shirts fest und Hubert und ich machten uns auf den
Weg zu unserem Produzenten nach Kopenhagen. Wir haben uns für das Unternehmen Neutral® entschieden, weil es eine der Top-Adressen für verantwortungsbewusste und
nachhaltige Textilproduktion ist. Die Zertifikate von Neutral® garantieren,
dass unsere T-Shirts mit der geringstmöglichen Belastung für unsere Erde
produziert wurden.

Möglicherweise
sehen viele in unserer Gesellschaft Menschenrechte als etwas
Selbstverständliches an und sind sich der Gefahr nicht bewusst, dass wir im
Begriff sind, diese fundamentalen Rechte über Bord zu werfen. Genau diese
Gefahr wollen wir den Menschen vor Augen führen und wieder ein Bewusstsein für dieses wichtige
Thema schaffen. 

Wir
sind aber davon überzeugt, dass wir mit unserem Konzept die Idee von
Menschenrechten jedem näherbringen können. 

Menschen
wie du haben uns dazu bewogen, diese Kampagne zu starten. Wir sind davon
überzeugt, dass viele unsere Idee, dass das Bewusstsein für Menschenrechte geschärft
werden sollte, ebenso wichtig finden wie wir. Sei also dabei und hilf uns,
wieder Aufmerksamkeit für dieses Thema zu schaffen!

Für
den Fall, dass wir den oben genannten Betrag nicht erreichen sollten, werden
wir uns natürlich weiterhin für Menschenrechte einsetzen und deren Wichtigkeit
für unsere Gesellschaft aufzeigen.




Wir benötigen die Hilfe jedes einzelnen, um das
Bewusstsein für Menschenrechte zu schärfen und eine Bewegung zu starten, die
ein klares Zeichen setzt: Ja zu Menschenrechten! Teile diese Kampagne auf
Facebook und Twitter, damit wir gemeinsam eine größere Aufmerksamkeit schaffen
können. Je lauter wir sind, desto eher erreichen wir jene, die sich mit diesem
Thema noch nicht auseinandergesetzt haben um ihnen zu zeigen, wie wichtig und wertvoll
Menschenrechte sind. Mit deiner Hilfe können wir Menschenrechte wieder mehr in
den Fokus der Gesellschaft rücken!



Umtausch


Wenn
du der Größentabelle, welche du per E-Mail nach der Kampagne zugesandt bekommst,
folgst, kann wenig schief gehen. Falls du dein TNI T-Shirt dennoch – aus
welchen Gründen auch immer – umtauschen möchtest, dann machen wir das natürlich
gerne. Da wir allerdings gerade erst dabei sind unsere Firma aufzubauen, können
wir die Transportkosten leider nicht übernehmen. Bitte achte außerdem darauf,
dass die T-Shirts ungetragen und ungewaschen sein müssen, wenn du sie
zurückschickst.

<p>Simple, light, easy to use. Fashionable, ecofriendly, hand made in Italy.<br/>Shield à Porter® is the real first anti-RFiD range of items having this long sequence of unusual features.</p>
<p>How was SàP® born? When Francesca and I started reading in the news about contactless creditcards scanning and by running a market survey, we realized it is quite difficult to find nice and value-for-money wallets we had the idea of creating an RFiD protected range of accessories to help any end user safeguard his/her own personal data and money.   </p>
<p>After long studies and talking with several factories in Italy and in China, we finally selected <strong>Almini Milano</strong> a great family run factory with the key characteristics we were looking for:</p>
<p>- ""<strong>hand</strong>"" <strong>working</strong> on each single item</p>
<p>- <strong>italian taste</strong> and <strong>style</strong></p>
<p>- using <strong>recycled leather</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478364112/fsnevkzhws65bafaioku.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>With Amos and Dante Almini, we studied a lot of available materials in the special market of ecofriendly recycled leather and, after many tests, we found a 100% granulate recycled leather, compacted into large, natural sand and dark grey coloured sheets.</p>

<h3>REFLECTRECOVERY.COM</h3>
<p>RECOVERY: A RETURN TO A NORMAL STATE OF HEALTH, MIND OR STRENTH.  THE ACTION OR PROCESS OF REGAINING POSSESSION OF SOMETHING LOST OR STOLEN. </p>
<p>ReflectRecovery.com is a brand apparel business designed to empower those of us in recovery.  Each day, we are reminded of one or both of the definitions above.  Whether we are recovering from addiction, cancer, abuse, disease, or grief, the mindset is still the same - to take personal ownership everyday of what and who we are.  We are not a victim of circumstance; we are individuals with the power to change, overcome, survive and thrive. </p>
<p>Every day we see different messages on someone’s shirt.  But, when we look in the mirror how do we see and respond to that message?  This is the concept behind our apparel line.  We are an online marketplace for EMPOWERMENT APPAREL.   The messages are in reverse so that when we look at ourselves in the mirror we are reminded of what we are; “Blessed”, “Worth It”, “Beautiful”, to “Be Kind”, to have ""Faith over Fear"", a “Survivor”.</p>
<p>We are also an online community of recovering individuals assisting others in recovery. We organize fundraisers and sponsor individuals who are starting out on their journeys, or those who may have hit a rough patch while trudging their road to Happy Destiny.    </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise funds for inventory and equipment.  We are also looking to start our sponsorship program out and to immediately start helping others.   We are starting out by launching our flagship shirt, ""Survivor"" for only $25.  All of our apparel comes from the top line manufacturers and for this event will be available in medium, large, X-large and XX-large.  Even if we do not reach our goal, we will still be sending out all of the shirts to those that have purchased them and donating the additional funds to one of the scholarship funds for individuals already in the queue.    </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As stated above, this is a business and an organization.  Not only is everyone who works on the team is in some stage of recovery, we are working toward empowering everyone who looks at themselves in the mirror everyday.  We are in recovery, for recovery by recovery.  Eventually, we would also like to set up a 3rd party marketplace where those in recovery will be able to sell their unique items and have a portion of those proceeds going toward additional scholarship funds. </p>
<p>When we go to bed at night, or wake up in the morning, we are the only ones that truly know how we feel, what we are thinking, what we are acting on.  The question that our apparel can answer is, ""Do you reflect your recovery?""</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>We understand that not everyone has the ability to donate/purchase.  We do ask if you believe in what we are trying to do, please share this by using the Indiegogo share tools or other share functions through social media.  Of course please contact us with any further questions.  Thanks for your consideration! </div></div>","REFLECTRECOVERY.COM

<h3>Symbiosis Soft Enamel Pins</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hi! I'm a nonbinary artist in Reno, Nevada who loves the local landscape and wildlife. These themes are prominently featured in my work.</li>
<li>This campaign will allow me to bring one of my favorite drawings to life as a soft enamel pin. It will be a wearable work of art that desert lovers can take with them everywhere to feel connected to this beautiful environment.</li>
<li>This campaign will also help me expand the range of merchandise I offer. I am an independent artist whose major source of income is my Etsy shop. Helping me fund this pin will help me expand my business and add a new item to my shop.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Artist's Statement</h3>
<ul>
<li>This drawing is called ""Symbiosis"" to play off the fact that coyotes and crows do not have symbiotic relationships in nature and in fact are both scavengers who compete over the same food sources. However, this piece re-imagines that relationship as a collaborative one, instead of a competitive dynamic, in which they can help one another survive.</li>
<li>The pairing of a coyote and crow is meant to symbolize the fact that while they may survive on their own in the harsh environment of the high desert, it would be easier for them both if they worked together. This piece is meant to be a reminder that while we are strong on our own, we are stronger when we work together as a community.</li>
<li>On a personal level, it also represents my partner and I, who represent ourselves as a crow and a coyote respectively in our zine series, and our bond and connection to each other as equals and collaborators.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Details</h3>
<ul>
<li>The pins will be 30mm high, made of soft enamel and come with a single post and rubber back.</li>
<li>3 inch tall vinyl stickers of the design are also available.</li>
<li>This campaign aims to raise $170, which will cover the production cost for 100 pins.</li>
<li>This campaign is using flexible funding, so even if the goal is not met, the stickers and pins will still be produced and sent to supporters!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>I have worked with all of the manufacturers involved previously and have around 8 years of experience with online sales and both domestic and international shipping.</li>
<li>However, shipping deadlines are meant to account for possible production delays and I will keep supporters informed of any issues that arise.</li>

shoes designer, I was born in a family of long time Artisan traditions. My family taught me how to express my skills.When I was young, my artistic attitudes, brought me to enrich my passions abroad. So I left Italy and went first to London and then to Barcelona. My working experiences in the main capitals of fashion made me a designer.My artisan attitudes and my constant care for  innovation and quality distinguishes my Sneakers. The result is a trendy product 100% Made in Italy who cares for feet wellness.My project on Indiegogo aims to realize for you a premium product entirely hand-dyed in LIMITED EDITION.That's why each pair of my hand-dyed shoes will have a serial number and  my signature.Each Style is both for man and woman. Shoes realized for this project are hand-dyed pair by pair. To obtain the best dyeing we have picked out a new material.To grant the best result we are proposing our best tested styles.Together with the shoes perks is enclosed a maintenance kit as follows:The jar contains 10 cl (3.38 oz) of water based dye in the same color as the shoes you have backed plus a polish cloth in woolen fabric.The woolen cloth is apt to polish vegetable tanned leathers as the one we use in manufacturing PlayHat hand-dyed sneakers. We have put a rough action on a hand-dyed sneakers with sand paper to show you how a maintenance kit works.
Clean the worn part of hand-dyed shoes with cloth  impregnated with ethyl alcohol
Wait a couple of minute
Dunk the sponge in the dye taking a slight quantity of color 
Apply the dye on worn area of shoes in smooth and circular motions
Wait half a hour to let the dye dry well
Take a paper handkerchief and remove the exceeded dye
Take the woolen cloth to polish shoes
Each hide has his own natural pattern that gives each product his own character if not drowned out during tanning.This is the reason why we are using goat skin to manufacture hand-dyed Playhat shoes.Goat skin has such a grain as to grant dyes both depth and shades you see in the pictures. Playhat sneakers are all leather lined, the insock is fully made of natural antibacterial latex, it is provided with an antishock under the heel that allows the back to releive from body weight.We always use a lasting sole made of natural leather.The endurance of Playhat shoes are due also to a particular sewing that links the sole to the upper.Each pairs of Playhat sneaker is hand-dyed with natural paints.The out soles are dyed pairs by pairs as the upper.We trust on reliable domestic suppliers who grant us with premium quality raw materials that match, even much further, our high quality standards. PlayHat brand has gained notable Italian awards during three edition of Florence Pitti Immagine.

<h3>THE POWER WALLET</h3>
<p>“<i>Exit comfortable and carefree</i>” the idea behind LF Power Wallet was designed to obtain in the smallest possible space everything you need to go out during the day or night without worries.<br/>When you want to leave home without stuffed pockets, but at the same time without anxiety for fear of seeing the exhaust phone when you most need it, the only choice falls on a<strong> thin and stylish object containing cards, banknotes, powerbank, charging cable and adapter with RFID blocking sistem</strong>.... thus LFpowerwallet was born... with <strong>high quality leather, handmade by crafts- men, in which fashion meets function</strong>.</p>

<h3>IDEA</h3>
<p>As often happens the idea came from a daily problem. The phone discharges quickly, so in order to avoid that, we leave the house with stuffed pockets carrying with us many objects; <strong>wallet, power bank, charging cable</strong>... So we decided to bring together all in a <strong>minimalist</strong> and <strong>functional</strong> object.</p>

<h3>CONCEPT</h3>
<p>In July 2015 the architect Luca Ferretti began to pursue the idea of creating an object of simple but technological design that can be useful in everyday life.<br/>The choice fell on solving some of the necessities of everyday life by merging in a small object a card holder/notes and a powerbank.<br/>The first step was to patent the idea in August 2015, after which began the research of the smallest and performing powerbank. In parallel we worked on prototyping the leather wallet model. Once ready the powerbank, the focus has shifted on design and object’s size.<br/>The first prototypes were born in December 2015, which was followed by modifications and testing, up to July 2016 with the final models.</p>

“The LF Power Wallet provides an intelligent, functional and stylish solution for a truly omnipresent problem. An accessory that avoids worries to every owner of smartphones without the need to fill their pockets with classic powerbank, cables and bulky wallets.”




THE POWER WALLET
“Exit comfortable and carefree” the idea behind LF Power Wallet was designed to obtain in the smallest possible space everything you need to go out during the day or night without worries.When you want to leave home without stuffed pockets, but at the same time without anxiety for fear of seeing the exhaust phone when you most need it, the only choice falls on a thin and stylish object containing cards, banknotes, powerbank, charging cable and adapter with RFID blocking sistem.... thus LFpowerwallet was born... with high quality leather, handmade by crafts- men, in which fashion meets function.





IDEA
As often happens the idea came from a daily problem. The phone discharges quickly, so in order to avoid that, we leave the house with stuffed pockets carrying with us many objects; wallet, power bank, charging cable... So we decided to bring together all in a minimalist and functional object.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HIGH QUALITY MATERIALS & ATTENTION TO DETAILS
As luxury traders specialists for over 40 years, we have selected the finest leathers which will pass the test of time. The workmanship is carried out by an italian top craftsmen in leather business, who work also for many famous international brands.
We chose a true ""saffiano"" leather; the ""saffiano"" is a particular texture of veal leather invented by Prada. The saffiano is a synonym for beauty and luxury and there are many other fashion brands that use this leather.

 
TECH SPECS

○ 10,1 x 7,2 x 0,8 cm○ Power bank: 2500 mAh○ Up to 24h smartphone battery○ Charging led○ Space for 3/4 card with slide○ 1 hidden pocket for your banknotes and coins○ Built in cable microUSB + apple adapter○ RFID Block○ Charging cable included
 
CHOOSE YOUR CUSTOM SEAMS

 
UNLOCK TOTAL BLACK  EDITION
Help us reach 14000€  and we could produce LF Power Wallet TOTAL BLACK edition.

 
CONCEPT
In July 2015 the architect Luca Ferretti began to pursue the idea of creating an object of simple but technological design that can be useful in everyday life.The choice fell on solving some of the necessities of everyday life by merging in a small object a card holder/notes and a powerbank.The first step was to patent the idea in August 2015, after which began the research of the smallest and performing powerbank. In parallel we worked on prototyping the leather wallet model. Once ready the powerbank, the focus has shifted on design and object’s size.The first prototypes were born in December 2015, which was followed by modifications and testing, up to July 2016 with the final models.


 
PERKS

TIMELINE

 
TEAM
Our team was born from shared ideas between father and son. We were then supported by other 2 members (a leather craftsman, a PR) to be able to optimally merge the functionality and fashion, making our days easier with style.

<p>Hello and thank you for visiting!  My name is Susan Dalton and I am the co-founder and CEO of Our Jewelry Club.  OJC is a Colorado based woman owned business specializing in high fashion jewelry for a reasonable price.  Our membership allows women to expand their jewelry collection for work, play and even special occasions.  </p>
<p>I have been the COO of a B2B membership association since 2002, so when I went to LA with a friend of mine so she could buy wholesale jewelry for her boutique I had the idea of combining the two.  OJC is the perfect merge – combining great jewelry with the growing popularity of membership sales models.</p>
<p>With the help of family I opened the first Our Jewelry Club in 2010.  But my father was ill and I had to close OJC in order to take over his business in 2012 while still working full time (three jobs proved to be too many).  By that time I had countless loyal members however family always comes first.  </p>
<p>So when my best friend suggested reopening Our Jewelry Club with her by my side, I could not resist.  After a 20-year friendship I could not wait to work with her and combine our talents. She brings a great eye and creative mind.  We have built a basic site to get us started, but do not have the kind of money needed to promote and market the business, just our vision for what it can become.</p>
<p>We have spent some time away, so regaining our positioning in search engines and getting the word out that Our Jewelry Club is back and better will take time and resources.  We are hoping to raise funds to market OJC to the masses, because the more members we have the better discounts we can negotiate.  This is not to increase our profits, but to bring even better jewelry to our members.</p>

<p>They look great, don't you think? Well, there is a dark side in the world of hand-knitted businesses you may not be aware of: Many companies that sell handmade alpaca wool products abuse the craftsmen and women who do them by paying them less than what they are really worth. As a consequence, they can never raise enough money to improve their lives standards or the ones of their children.</p>
<p>We created <a href=""https://www.tinkuy.shop"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tinkuy</a> (Quechua word for 'together' and for 'meeting point') to try to do something about it. Our goal is to help Peruvian craftswomen's sell their valuable handmade works at <i>realistic</i> prices to a market that <i>really</i> values them. By reducing the number of middlemen to just one, artists make more profit for their work. As a matter of fact, they get the lion's share from each sell from our store.</p>
<p>In addition, we have reached an agreement with associations of women who are currently imprisoned. We are already selling their products too, motivating them this way to concentrate their time in producing something worth selling instead of thinking about commiting crimes once they get freedom.</p>
<p>At the moment, Tinkuy is starting with craftpersons in Junin, Peru. Yet our intention is to help all Peruvian artists sell their works fairly to the world in a reasonable short future.</p>

<p>Challenges:</p>
<p>We look forward to empowering as many more rural communities as possible, to achieve this we must promote the crafts and reach more people who prefer Tinkuy products, since there will be more demand and will need to join to the project to more communities. </p>
<p>Risks:</p>
<p>Not to can generate the necessary monetary resources for the sustainability of the Tinkuy project because our desire is to be able to help more artisans and communities of Peru.</p>
<p>We take care of the environment:  </p>
<p>Tinkuy has an organizational culture, in the workplace, that is respectful of the environment based on energy saving.  </p>
<p>Tinkuy's production policy is not based on large-scale production, as large companies do, but it is a production and a more personalized quality since the products are handmade, thus contributing to the care of the environment.  </p>
<p>The packaging used for the delivery of the product is 100% made of recycled paper, which guarantees the non-deforestation of the trees, in addition, the inks with which these bags are printed are water-based inks, harmless to living beings.</p>
<p>High quality in our products:</p>
<p>Tinkuy has policies to encourage master craftsmen to produce quality products.</p>
<p>To support the Tinkuy project you do not need to have money, you can help us sharing or divulging our purpose in social networks.</p>

They look great, don't you think? Well, there is a dark side in the world of hand-knitted businesses you may not be aware of: Many companies that sell handmade alpaca wool products abuse the craftsmen and women who do them by paying them less than what they are really worth. As a consequence, they can never raise enough money to improve their lives standards or the ones of their children.
We created Tinkuy (Quechua word for 'together' and for 'meeting point') to try to do something about it. Our goal is to help Peruvian craftswomen's sell their valuable handmade works at realistic prices to a market that really values them. By reducing the number of middlemen to just one, artists make more profit for their work. As a matter of fact, they get the lion's share from each sell from our store.
In addition, we have reached an agreement with associations of women who are currently imprisoned. We are already selling their products too, motivating them this way to concentrate their time in producing something worth selling instead of thinking about commiting crimes once they get freedom.
At the moment, Tinkuy is starting with craftpersons in Junin, Peru. Yet our intention is to help all Peruvian artists sell their works fairly to the world in a reasonable short future.
Some other examples
 

Mate burilado. The technique involves engraving fine lines into a gourd with a scalpel called a ""buril,"" creating a series of drawings that generally represent active scenes of farming life.
 
                   

Mirtha Huangal loves knitting. Every time she does it, she delivers a work of art, and she feels she is transmitting her passion.
 

Sweaters and clothing on Tinkuy are 100% hand knitted baby alpaca wool. Many of them are provided by the Association of Crafts Knitters of Jauja prison.
 

María Elena Cusi Puma is an expert weaver of blankets and quilts. She works both sheep and alpaca wool with a manual loom.
 

Her weaving students consider her the best teacher of loom in this beautiful project. She trains women in Hualhuas, Peru. Wool balls are made with a spinning wheel, ""It is a long but productive process, I love it!""
 

Once the wool ball is complete, the straw is extracted and finally washed.
At Tinkuy.shop online store we will include a short description about each of them, so you can learn a bit more about who is behind each of them, who shared their art with you.  
We want this initiative to grow and involve more communities in our country. We want to turn the talent of Peruvians into income for their households, and break the vicious circle that makes many still think about Peru as a country with poverty.
Help us help!  

Tinkuy Team
Tinkuy was born as a social responsibility project, led by a group of university students. After visiting many communities away from their cities, they found a weird combination of low income and really fine skills in craftsmanship that have been taught from generation to generation.

Amanda Dolorier, loves the flowers and confesses that in most of her work we will find beautiful traditional flowers of Huancayo - Peru.
 

Maria and Daniel are planning to visit their mother and give her a big surprise, but Daniel forgot the drawing he had prepared for Mom.
They decided to create a marketing medium for the products created by women artisans and their apprentices, and realize that these could be sold without middlemen, and with a fair payment to artists.
Today Tinkuy has a basic online shop where you can buy handmade products; including household items, beautiful baby alpaca wool sweaters and handmade garments that you may find second to any other high-quality clothing in the world. All they need is someone seling them smartly.
 

When you acquire a product from Tinkuy, you take much more; dreams, shopping tradition and history. Take a little Peru to your home helping improve the living conditions of a craftsman.
As mentioned above, we have partnered with the Kniting Craftswomen Association of Jauja Prison in the city of Junin, Peru, who weave alpaca sweaters and accessories, helping these women to find a second chance to start the right path.
Tinkuy also believes that training programs are important for every individual, so we are planning to supplement our selling business with training programs in the future as well.
Tinkuy seeks to give special attention to helping the inmates confront the challenges they face when they return to the community.
 

All of the sweaters provided by Tinkuy's virtual store are 100% baby alpaca. Each of them has been made by women artisans from the Association of Knitters of Jauja Prison.

Challenges:
We look forward to empowering as many more rural communities as possible, to achieve this we must promote the crafts and reach more people who prefer Tinkuy products, since there will be more demand and will need to join to the project to more communities. 
Risks:
Not to can generate the necessary monetary resources for the sustainability of the Tinkuy project because our desire is to be able to help more artisans and communities of Peru.
We take care of the environment:  
Tinkuy has an organizational culture, in the workplace, that is respectful of the environment based on energy saving.  
Tinkuy's production policy is not based on large-scale production, as large companies do, but it is a production and a more personalized quality since the products are handmade, thus contributing to the care of the environment.  
The packaging used for the delivery of the product is 100% made of recycled paper, which guarantees the non-deforestation of the trees, in addition, the inks with which these bags are printed are water-based inks, harmless to living beings.
High quality in our products:
Tinkuy has policies to encourage master craftsmen to produce quality products.
To support the Tinkuy project you do not need to have money, you can help us sharing or divulging our purpose in social networks.",60.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Starting out from Nepal, growing out to the world, posed a seemingly insurmountable challenge for us. Almost a mountain like. We chose to be inspired by it, than to succumb to it. As the upshot, we created our AMA DABLAM collection - a namesake for a mountain with the most aesthetic climbing route in the world.</p>
<p>The ascents, the descents and quirky twin-headed peaks with crevasses creating dramatic accents inspired the clean chamfers on the frontal face of our designs. The bold, unapologetic design attempts to resemble the striking grandeur of Mt. AMA DABLAM overshooting the sky.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.redd.it/6rlgorj86s011.gif"" src="""" style=""padding-bottom:2%;padding-top:2%;""/></p>
<p>All in all, amalgamation of our ethos to create impact beyond ourselves and boundaries &amp; the challenge to grow beyond territories posed at us defined our AMA DABLAM collection. And here, we present it to you.</p>

<p>Ama Dablam Series is a reflection of our extensive efforts towards creating that perfect combination of protection, comfort and style. Our team in Nepal spent the last year brainstorming on the best possible designs.</p>

<p>Getting it RIGHT is important to us. All our designs go through diligent prototyping starting out with minimal cardboard cut-out, then to 3D printed designs &amp; finally moving on to sampling table.</p>

<p>Our story began in 2014 with an aim to create a brand where we all can give back to the society. We believed in the power of unity and were sure that when you and we come together we can change things towards progress. With that belief we introduced our first line-up of eyewear as a means to offer a solution to the deep rooted problem of cataracts in rural Nepal. </p>

<p>Starting November, 2018 we will be funding our first remedial courses for the struggling public school students in rural Nepal. The remedial courses help by strengthening the fundamentals of the lowest-performing students leading to an increased interest in learning, and the confidence needed to continue and complete an education.</p>

</div></div>","Starting out from Nepal, growing out to the world, posed a seemingly insurmountable challenge for us. Almost a mountain like. We chose to be inspired by it, than to succumb to it. As the upshot, we created our AMA DABLAM collection - a namesake for a mountain with the most aesthetic climbing route in the world.
The ascents, the descents and quirky twin-headed peaks with crevasses creating dramatic accents inspired the clean chamfers on the frontal face of our designs. The bold, unapologetic design attempts to resemble the striking grandeur of Mt. AMA DABLAM overshooting the sky.

All in all, amalgamation of our ethos to create impact beyond ourselves and boundaries & the challenge to grow beyond territories posed at us defined our AMA DABLAM collection. And here, we present it to you.
 

 
 







 

Ama Dablam Series is a reflection of our extensive efforts towards creating that perfect combination of protection, comfort and style. Our team in Nepal spent the last year brainstorming on the best possible designs.

Getting it RIGHT is important to us. All our designs go through diligent prototyping starting out with minimal cardboard cut-out, then to 3D printed designs & finally moving on to sampling table.

Colors and patterns speak volumes. We understand that at Anthropose. Every design undergoes a lot of variation sampling before it hits the production line.

Our story began in 2014 with an aim to create a brand where we all can give back to the society. We believed in the power of unity and were sure that when you and we come together we can change things towards progress. With that belief we introduced our first line-up of eyewear as a means to offer a solution to the deep rooted problem of cataracts in rural Nepal. 


As of December 2017, we have been able to restore eyesight of 186 people in rural Nepal.
Get the full report here. 

Starting November, 2018 we will be funding our first remedial courses for the struggling public school students in rural Nepal. The remedial courses help by strengthening the fundamentals of the lowest-performing students leading to an increased interest in learning, and the confidence needed to continue and complete an education.

<p align=""center"">Here at ASOROCK Watches, a name influenced by the breath-taking mountains in Central Nigeria, our love and affection for watches, created a desire in us, to make a positive long-lasting impact on the African continent by representing her in the luxury watch market of the world.</p>
<p align=""center"">Being avid watch enthusiasts ourselves, we were fed up with our limited choices due to the inflated high mark up prices of popular name brands. It also didn't help that we always felt like our collection was never complete <strong><i>(a problem all true watch enthusiasts can relate to)</i></strong>. It bothered us even more that we didn't have a single watch from an African source where we have our roots. All these led to the creation of the ASOROCK range of watches. </p>
<p align=""center"">Primarily, we believe that through the sales of our fantastically made watches we will raise the funds needed to realize our deep dreams of building libraries with computers equipped with Wifi and learning software in various villages in Africa. </p>
<p align=""center"">We also foresee the<strong><i> massive amounts of employment our brand will offer </i></strong>from; library keepers to tech-savvy millennials worldwide who want to promote and be an influencer for us, and also down to our photographers and design team that will grow as we grow and produce better designs than we have now. <strong>These factors further led us to the creation of ASOROCK. </strong></p>
<p>That's<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> why </span>ASOROCK<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> Watches is truly more than just another watch company, <strong> not only are we more of a charity at heart</strong> by using the sales of our awesome watches as leverage to achieve our core aims of helping empower the youths in our motherland and continent, <strong>but we are also seeking to create jobs.</strong> </span></p>

<p>We have spent the last year and a half<strong> </strong>meeting with designers, factories and industry experts to come up with an affordable, stylish looking watch collection that we know everyone will love.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">When designing our watches, <i><strong>we did not hold back on quality</strong></i>. We made sure of 4 prospects that differentiate us:</p>
<p><strong> 1)</strong> We offer various multiple models of watches under each watch type.</p>
<p><strong>2) </strong>All of our watches are <strong>made with the finest quality of materials</strong>. (staying true to our principles<i> ""if you are going to do something, do it right""</i>) </p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> We offer our watches at a price less than<strong> half of what our competitors charge for watches of the same category.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4) </strong>Purchase of any AsoRock watch, <strong>does more than just get you compliments,</strong> it also goes towards helping to <strong>create a better foundation for the youths in Africa. </strong></p>

<p>Started by young entrepreneurs and watch enthusiasts Ben Iroala (Nigerian American), and Andrew Mutale (Zambian American) who sought to cut out the high retail markup of popular name brands. We have been obsessed with watches our entire life and got <strong>fed up paying for overpriced name brand watches that only cost a fraction of the price to produce.</strong> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We share the same vision and<strong> hope to one day become successful entrepreneurs who will eventually build multiple libraries, free hospitals, free education and many more for our people.</strong></p>
<p><strong>However, we know we need funds to make those dreams of uplifting our homeland a reality</strong>. So in the summer of 2017 we <strong>assembled a team of other like-minded individuals</strong> including the young, highly creative Maclaine Morris to<strong> create a fantastically made watch that we can sell and use part of the profit to achieve the ultimate dream of contributing significantly to changing Africa.</strong></p>

<p>ASOROCK brand is more than just a company. We aim to achieve 6 things:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>1)</strong>  Put Africa on the spotlight as a continent whose entrepreneurs are capable of creating affordable brands of quality luxury products.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>2)</strong> <strong>)</strong> We want everybody to <strong>diversify their watch collection </strong>by adding a watch that stands for something.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>3)</strong> Introduce more millennials to the awesomeness of horology and watches. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>4)</strong> <strong>Disrupt the watch industry</strong> by proving that <strong>making and buying a luxuriously made watch does not have to break the bank. </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>5) Creation of jobs for millennials.</strong> As we grow so will our diverse team of designers, accountants and independent ""gig"" employees such as social influencers and photographers.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>6)</strong> <strong>Be an example to African youths/start-ups:</strong> that we can be a part of this world and its fashion scene while giving back directly to the community with free schools and learning/sports centers in Nigeria and with time, Africa as a whole.</p>

Here at ASOROCK Watches, a name influenced by the breath-taking mountains in Central Nigeria, our love and affection for watches, created a desire in us, to make a positive long-lasting impact on the African continent by representing her in the luxury watch market of the world.
Being avid watch enthusiasts ourselves, we were fed up with our limited choices due to the inflated high mark up prices of popular name brands. It also didn't help that we always felt like our collection was never complete (a problem all true watch enthusiasts can relate to). It bothered us even more that we didn't have a single watch from an African source where we have our roots. All these led to the creation of the ASOROCK range of watches. 
Primarily, we believe that through the sales of our fantastically made watches we will raise the funds needed to realize our deep dreams of building libraries with computers equipped with Wifi and learning software in various villages in Africa. 
We also foresee the massive amounts of employment our brand will offer from; library keepers to tech-savvy millennials worldwide who want to promote and be an influencer for us, and also down to our photographers and design team that will grow as we grow and produce better designs than we have now. These factors further led us to the creation of ASOROCK. 
That's why ASOROCK Watches is truly more than just another watch company,  not only are we more of a charity at heart by using the sales of our awesome watches as leverage to achieve our core aims of helping empower the youths in our motherland and continent, but we are also seeking to create jobs. 





 

We have spent the last year and a half meeting with designers, factories and industry experts to come up with an affordable, stylish looking watch collection that we know everyone will love.
When designing our watches, we did not hold back on quality. We made sure of 4 prospects that differentiate us:
 1) We offer various multiple models of watches under each watch type.
2) All of our watches are made with the finest quality of materials. (staying true to our principles ""if you are going to do something, do it right"") 
3) We offer our watches at a price less than half of what our competitors charge for watches of the same category.
4) Purchase of any AsoRock watch, does more than just get you compliments, it also goes towards helping to create a better foundation for the youths in Africa. 
THE MONOLITH SERIES  
 

THE SPEEDRACER (Below)

 


For our first releases, we are offering 2 series with 7 models to choose from 
The ""Monolith"" Collection:  Available in 5 variations, all with interchangeable bands to give you more versatility in your style selection.


 
Below - The ""Speedracer"" Collection: Available in two variations (All Black and RoseGold/Black)


 
ASOROCK WATCHES IS ALSO BACKED WITH A WARRANTY!
We are very confident in the quality and durability of our watches that If something were to happen within the first two (2) years, we hope you will send it back to us for replacement. 
WARRANTY DOES NOT COVER:

The battery life
Wear and tear (scratches etc)
Any damage on any part of the watch resulting from abnormal/abusive use, lack of care, negligence, accidents (knocks dents, crushing, broken crystal, etc.) 

 

In the near future, we hope to have a wider range of different types and styles of watches that will always remain affordable. Pictures of some of our future renderings are on the last page. We plan to unveil our stylish, feminine range of watches shortly. 
By December 2019, we plan to lay the foundation of our first Youth Complex in a village in Nigeria. When completed, the Complex will have a library fitted with computers equipped with Wifi and free learning software and sports amenities (such as a basketball court) for the youngsters to discover their talents. 
To show appreciation to our backers, their names will be engraved on a Pillar in the middle of the Youth Complex upon which we shall fly the Indiegogo flag. 
We also have long-term plans of diversifying into other fashion accessories such as Sunglasses, Belts, Bracelets/Rings etc. Needless to say, we are here for the long-term and plan to take ""AsoRock Watches"" and its subsidiaries such as ""AsoRock Sunglasses"" to the level of a globally recognized brand someday, with your support, of course.
So why not join with us on this fun and exciting journey and be a part of it every step of the way. We will send out several updates throughout the entire process making sure our backers are up-to-date on any important information.  We want to create a bond, and synergy with our backers because ultimately you are the ones turning our dream into a reality and we appreciate you from the bottom of our hearts.  We are excited to grow and anxious to see what the future has in store for us.

 

To be a success we have made highly precise calculated estimations and came to a figure:
We need a minimum of $15,000 in funding to be able to mass produce our first two collections and ship out orders, as well as to cover advertisement costs and other operating expenses. And, laying the foundation on the youth complex. 
 


To your right, you will see some perks : 
1) Pledge $59  and receive one of the Speedracers (retailing for $110)
2) Pledge $69 and receive any of the five (5) Monolith watches donate 
3) Pledge $110 and receive all two (2) of the Speedracers (retailing for $220) . 
4) Pledge $130 and receive 2 of the Monolith (retailing for $240)
5) Pledge $340 and receive all 5 of the Monolith collection (retailing $600)
All names of backers/Pre-orderers will be engraved on a monumental pillar in the middle of the library complex we plan to build in a village in Nigeria by December 2019 regardless of the amount donated 

 

If we don't reach our 15k goal, we will use any funds raised to produce the bulk for the watch and possibly launch only one collection first instead of two; we won't let not reaching our monetary goal stop us!! A child in Africa who doesn't know we exist is depending on us to succeed.
 

Started by young entrepreneurs and watch enthusiasts Ben Iroala (Nigerian American), and Andrew Mutale (Zambian American) who sought to cut out the high retail markup of popular name brands. We have been obsessed with watches our entire life and got fed up paying for overpriced name brand watches that only cost a fraction of the price to produce. 
We share the same vision and hope to one day become successful entrepreneurs who will eventually build multiple libraries, free hospitals, free education and many more for our people.
However, we know we need funds to make those dreams of uplifting our homeland a reality. So in the summer of 2017 we assembled a team of other like-minded individuals including the young, highly creative Maclaine Morris to create a fantastically made watch that we can sell and use part of the profit to achieve the ultimate dream of contributing significantly to changing Africa.

PROJECT TIMELINE 


Now we're here on IndieGogo, with two fully functional prototypes that look absolutely stunning. We just need one more thing... your support to mass produce them for the world.
 


ASOROCK brand is more than just a company. We aim to achieve 6 things:
1)  Put Africa on the spotlight as a continent whose entrepreneurs are capable of creating affordable brands of quality luxury products.
2) ) We want everybody to diversify their watch collection by adding a watch that stands for something.
3) Introduce more millennials to the awesomeness of horology and watches. 
4) Disrupt the watch industry by proving that making and buying a luxuriously made watch does not have to break the bank. 
5) Creation of jobs for millennials. As we grow so will our diverse team of designers, accountants and independent ""gig"" employees such as social influencers and photographers.
6) Be an example to African youths/start-ups: that we can be a part of this world and its fashion scene while giving back directly to the community with free schools and learning/sports centers in Nigeria and with time, Africa as a whole.
Your contribution will make all these a reality and you can be proud you were part of the water that made the AsoRock seed grow. 
 
We've modified the initial prototype, finalized our design, purchased the molds and selected a manufacturer that has a great reputation in the industry.  Once Indiegogo campaign ends, Our team will then ship the orders to the backers of perk 1 (the Speedracer) who will receive the watches within 15days. All other backers will receive their watches approximately 1-2 months after the campaign ends. We have experience with shipping from our E-commerce background which should make for a very smooth process.

</div></div>","Short Summary

Two young women on the brink of graduating college with their degrees in Finance partnered in January of 2019 with a concept - to create a brand of contemporary and stylish clothing for both modest Muslim and Orthodox Jewish women.
We teamed up with the Susquehanna Township - School of Fashion, where the talented students listened to our pitch and created their own designs based on the ideals of modest fashion. We had the pleasure of working with their mentor, a boutique clothing designer, Richard Andries.The design and prototype creation was a collaborative process among all of the fashion students. The head designers of AMAL's Introductory Collection are: Lemede Magil, Pamela Martinez, Laelani Porter, Lenysha Howze, and Shylin Clark.




What We Need & What You Get

AMAL is currently only in the prototype stage, where the first line of garments has been designed and created, but we are in need of funding in order to mass produce and get our actual E-commerce website running. 
We are in the midst of registering for business competitions and finding investors for our small business, as well as opening this campaign for contributors to help us out on our mission.
Through the fundraiser, we will be accepting donations and selling merchandise.  These items are branded AMAL merchandise including shirts, hats, sweaters, and accessories.  We hope the money generated from these sales will help us be able to start manufacturing our fashion clothing line.
We estimate a flexible goal of $10,000 for this campaign to be reached within 60 days.


The Impact

Orthodox Jewish and Muslim women are unlikely counterparts due to political disagreements. In a time where fashion revolves around sex appeal, it can be quite difficult for religious women to find clothing that both interests them and suits their ideals. However, we have recognized that Orthodox Jewish and Muslim women face similar struggles regarding religious appearance customs. 
As a future goal when AMAL is established and revenue-building, we hope to donate 5% of revenue to related peace-driven causes.

Stylish fit
Men, Women, and Children's sizes
Easy to use handguard
Hood and transparent visor to use as a face covering
A HEIQ V-Block barrier against contaminants
    Our award-winning HeiQ V-Block coats our jacket fabric, zippers, hand, and face shields to give the jacket an extra layer of protection against contaminants that may be lurking in train stations, airports, at the supermarket, and anywhere else where you might go.Gentle enough to come in contact with your skin, but tough on microorganisms and other potentially dangerous elements, HeiQ V-Block effectively inhibits the growth and persistence of these invisible impurities that use textiles as a hosting surface. The jacket itself is dubbed the “JUST5” Jacket because it takes a HeiQ V-Block treated surface only up to 5 minutes to eliminate.  HEIQ V-Block is not only trusted by brands like Serta Simmons Bedding, Kenneth Cole, and Cornelia James, but now Gold's Gym has joined the HEIQ family. In partnership with Escape Fitness, the HeiQ V-block Ecosystem will be implemented in individual gyms, as they are scheduled to reopen across California in the coming months. Because HEIQ V-Block is a bio-based, non-toxic, and non-allergenic antimicrobial surface protection spray, it's a perfect fit for gyms and other spaces that are frequently used.  All parts of the JUST5 Jacket are treated with HeiQ V-Block - the ultimate fabric protection from microorganisms and other nasties.  Built with Italian style and design, the JUST5 Jacket is more than just functional, but has an everyday urban design that’s easily integrated into any wardrobe. It’s also adjustable at the hood and the waist for the perfect fit. Made for travel, the JUST5 has a built-in travel pouch that the jacket collapses into for easy, compact portability.  The JUST5 is also made of WINDTEX, a water-repellent, and breathable premium layered fabric, the JUST5 Jacket is seam taped to guarantee that it’s waterproof. Because it also has thermo-regulating technology, the fabric maintains the heat of the body so the wearer is always comfortable - not too hot, not too cold - just the right balance. It’s the perfect length for fuller coverage and is durable for colder weather when worn over warmer clothing.  Featuring a simple, but innovative design, the hand shields are not just a cuff or glove, but an extendable elastic cuff made with an internal, reversed pocket.  Easy to slip over your hand, you can feel confident when you need to grip a pole on the subway, hold the railing of an escalator, or press an elevator button - and then slip them off once you’re done. Comfortable to wear for children and adults alike, you can still use your smartphone, tablet, or iPad screens thanks to the special warp-knitted fabric. And, of course, it’s all coated with HeiQ V-Block for added protection for all the nasty, invisible things that we unconsciously touch during the day. Because the zippers to your coat and pockets are places that you might touch over and over again, we’ve made sure to coat it in HeiQ V-Block as well for even more shielding from nasty things. Developed by 2A-NYGUARD the famed first Italian zipper manufacturer in Europe’s history, our zippers are made to last.The hood is designed to fit any head and is easily adjustable using the rear tie rods. The clear visor is transparent so as to offer protection, while not obstructing your view. We’ve even included a special glasses-cleaning cloth coated in HeiQ V-Block. Glasses and screens get smudged and we want to make sure that none of the contaminants that might inhabit them transfer and stay on the cloth.   If you follow the sizing chart carefully, then the jacket should fit you just fine. Still, if you wish to exchange your jacket for any reason, we’ll happily do that but you’ll have to pay for shipping both ways. Because we are offering our jackets at highly discounted prices, we won’t be able to accept returns. Please make sure the items are unworn and unwashed. Also, all items must be in the condition you received them in with all hang tags still attached. We accept exchanges up to 30 days after you receive the jacket.Antimicrobial properties are built into the product. This product does not guarantee to protect you against human pathogens including bacteria, germs or other organisms. We encourage you to follow CDC guidelines. Please check their website for prevention tips.

<p>Have you ever caught yourself buying a cheap umbrella thinking that it will break or get lost eventually and so there is no point investing in its quality? Or maybe you bought the one, then only just to leave it on a bus or in a restaurant? <br/><br/>           Baobab brolly is a modern response to everything that is wrong with the current market offerings. Featuring loss prevention system &amp; based on a modular system (letting you swap just the part you’re not happy with, as opposed to having to discard the whole brolly), it’s a sustainable solution for the world where everything else is smart.</p>

<p>Clef Innovation was set up in England on August 2015, after our first ever brolly was invented. Up until today, we've spent approximately 12 000 hours working together, travelled about 45 000 km (across 10 different countries) gathering a talented team and establishing wonderful partnerships. We have umbrella-making mentors from around the globe (Great Britain, United States, Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan) and a design team that lives &amp; breaths their work, trying to make each and every brolly a little work of art. We believe that our team has everything that it takes to make it the last umbrella you'll ever buy. </p>

</div></div>","Have you ever caught yourself buying a cheap umbrella thinking that it will break or get lost eventually and so there is no point investing in its quality? Or maybe you bought the one, then only just to leave it on a bus or in a restaurant?            Baobab brolly is a modern response to everything that is wrong with the current market offerings. Featuring loss prevention system & based on a modular system (letting you swap just the part you’re not happy with, as opposed to having to discard the whole brolly), it’s a sustainable solution for the world where everything else is smart.
 

Only the handles and straps can be customized for this release.
 
 


Unlike any other umbrella in the world, we have embedded loss alert smart technology into the handle which is connected to an app on your smartphone. No more worrying about which restaurant you left your umbrella at - you will not lose another umbrella because we made it that way.  

bbb.B’s smart handle features loss prevention system which will go off when the distance between your mobile and your brolly is greater than 15 steps. It will also let you locate your brolly on the map, thanks to the Beacon tracking system.   

 

 

The battery lasts up to 1,905 days. 
 
 

 

Based on British craftsmen’s know-how bbb.B applies the original umbrella-making technology (developed and tested for over 150 years) and enhances it with nickel frame and strengthened iron ribs to ensure you are prepared for the worst weather. 
 

 

Windproof frame study
 

Solid and resilient steel nickel frame
 

Wind tunnel test
 

20m/s(44.74mph)
 

 


bbb.B is customizable and can be disassembled down to handle, canopy and tip. It not only offers you the option to personalise your bbb.B experience but also improves the umbrella's natural lifespan. The modular nature of bbb.B allows you to replace parts rather than discarding the whole brolly. 
 

 
Once our Kickstarter orders have been fulfilled we’ll be offering spare parts online, via our e-commerce store.
 



 

From the start of the production to the final ironing, all of our umbrellas are 90% handmade by trained craftsmen who pour their soul into each and every unit they make.
 

 

 
No matter how good the waterproof coating is, the wear & tear cannot be avoided. Worry not though, bbb.B offers more advanced waterproofing than other umbrellas in the market due to its fabric.  

Our fabric is made of 75 strands of polyester tied together in a single thread. It has more than 30% higher density compared to other umbrellas available on the market, with the same 75T fabric.
Did you know that you can use bbb.B for sun protection too? The effect may differ between the colours but you can expect UV blocking of anything between 90% (Urban Classic Black) to 60% (Urban Classic Light Gray). 
 

 

 
 

 

 
Your brolly’s unique product number is laser-engraved for effective post-purchase care. It works as your warranty and ensures custom-tailored service in the future. 
 

 
 

 
 bbb.B has a total length of 91cm (36"") and its diameter when opened is 110cm (43"").
Canopies : Four colours(Light gray, Apricot, Black, Deep Green) are available. 
Handle : Aluminum, PolyCarbonate 
Strap : Italy Full Grain Leather
Weight : Approximately 800 grams (28.21 ounces)
 

 

 
 

 
bbb.B features silicone runner handle which lets you safely unfasten & fix the umbrella's safety latch.  
 

 
 

 

Add your own personality with bbb.B’s luxurious FG leather stripe which wraps itself gently around your wrist - extra chrome coating was applied to protect it against rainwater and any other potential contamination.
 

 

For myself, and for the beloved ones, the product as is. We package and deliver with sincerity for the people waiting for bbb.B.

Did you know that Sheffield, England, is a birthplace of the modern umbrella? That's where we come from. bbb.B is a combination of the essential structure of an umbrella (in use for over 150 years!) and a modern outtake on the umbrella's ribs - a combination bound to bring you a maximized performance.   
 

Take a little trip down our memory lane and see our very first designs of what you now know as Baobab Brolly.  
 

 
 

 

Did you know? We're aiming to send at least 1,060 units before Christmas! Be one of the first ones to pledge & receive your brolly before anybody else does!

Not only did we find that it already existed, but it has been around for almost 700 years. It was actually the original way of telling the time.A couple of weeks passed before we started to think that we were likely not alone in having never seen a 24-hour dial. We began asking around and speaking to people in the industry - including watchmakers - and sure enough, it was as new to them as it was to us. To this day, we've only met a handful of people that have come across the concept.The brands that had attempted a 24-hour dial either lacked elegance or were charging an insane amount of money - keeping the concept hidden. So we set out to create a watch that exudes style and distinction at an affordable price, but with a genuinely unique concept. Telling The TimeTelling the time on a 24-hour dial can be tricky to begin with. You are essentially learning how to tell the time all over again. The trickiness isn't because of something inherent to 24-hour dials but rather because of our conditioning to only use 12-hour dials.Our dials display the time in 10-minute increments, but you can easily estimate the time to the nearest 5 minutes by simply focusing for a little longer. Sure, you could argue that 12-hour dials display the time more accurately, but when does it truly matter if it's 15:59 or 16:00, anyway? This is time displayed more naturally, not more accurately.Psychology Of The DialOwning, wearing and even just seeing a 24-hour dial gives you an entirely different awareness of time itself. We also found that placing the midday point at the top of the dial - causing the hand to appear in the top half of the watch while you're going about your day - has an uplifting effect.Once you start using a 24-hour dial, you soon become aware of the fact that it’s a much more natural way of visualizing where you are in your day.Using The Watch As A CompassAs well as simply telling the time, you can also use your watch as a compass.NORTHERN HEMISPHERE: Simply point the hand towards the position of the sun, and wherever the '24' marker is pointing, is North.SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE: Simply point the '12' marker towards the position of the sun, and wherever the hand is pointing, is North.It may come in handy one day!It Just Makes SenseThe 24-hour dial just seems to make sense - one hand that passes each marker once a day.It might not change the world, but it could change yours. The early history of the clock - as a post-sundial concept - is not particularly well known. Historians do however agree that they were likely just devices that rang bells at regular intervals. So when Prince Ubertino de Carrara commissioned Jacopo de’Dondi to design and erect a public clock, with a face, in the Torre dei Signori of the Palazzo del Capitanio in Padua, the world would finally be able to visualise time.The clock contained a 24-hour dial, with the hour hand rotating at half the speed of that that we consider to be normal today.Sadly, the clock was destroyed by fire between 1390 and 1399, so there is only a replacement clock, which was built in 1423, standing in its place today; it is said to be a faithful copy of the original.Image courtesy of Nicola Lovato @niclovJacopo's son would later go on to write the following about his own clock:“...we desire nothing more from it than the uniform and equal motion of a wheel which shall complete its course in the space of a natural day, and such a wheel is called the horary sphere.”The Phasing Out Of The 24-Hour DialSometime around the early 1500's, the clockmakers of France and Germany had started to use the 12-hour dial. By the late 1500's the whole of Europe had changed to using this more ambiguous method. There's no obvious reason as to why the switch happened, but the 24-hour dial would be forgotten until the 20th century.Radio amateurs, pilots and the military have adopted the concept in modern times, and you'd struggle to find anyone familiar with the design that doesn't have a military-style background or is exceptionally well-versed in horology.We love the 24-hour dial, though and we want to make the design familiar once again!  Interchangeable StrapsIf you would like to add another strap, then just add $25 AUD to your pledge, for each additional strap.Swapping the straps around is easy. Simply use a small flat-headed screwdriver to release the spring in the strap and it comes right off.

Increased water-resistance reliability by increasing the thickness of the case wall by 0.5 mm (barely noticeable to the naked eye), and

No changes will occur that will drastically alter the overall look of the watch and any adjustments - minor or major - will always be an improvement. If any changes are made to the design, then our backers will be the first to know.Reduced Logo SizeOne thing that has come to our attention, since we received our prototypes, is that the branding on our dial is slightly too large.We're happy to say that we will be going to production with a more subtle, spaced out logo. Photoshop warning!We know that you are ultimately buying into the concept, but it still has to be something that you're proud to wear - a watch is an incredibly personal item.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have the ambition to bring the most talented people together and help them be creative. We take risks and face tough challenges every day. One of the risks of this project is the R&amp;D effort we already invested. If we don't get enough pledges, we might lose the opportunity to order components in bulk and this might drive up Snipy's price. We want people to enjoy the comfort and ease Snipy can provide at a reasonable price. For this, we need your support by pledging.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
We are a startup, dedicated to agile web & mobile  development and cutting edge Internet of Things applications. We believe in continuous learning and lifelong partnerships. For the past 6 months we've been working on Snipy, a smart gadget that watches over your postbox and personal space. Anytime post arrives or movement is detected, you get a notification on your smartphone.

 
What We Need & What You Get
After an extensive Research and Development phase, we still need $45.000 to bring Snipy to life. For starters, we need to order components in bulk quantities.
We value your contribution and for the limited time of this campaign, we offer you Snipy at a special price. Early backers will be rewarded with large discounts.
 

The Impact
We aspire to bring you a novel solution to a century old problem: getting important mail as soon as possible.

There are many other use cases for Snipy, many of which we probably didn't even think of. We leave this task to you, our esteemed contributor.
 

 

Product features
Free online account for managing notifications
Create a free account on www.snipy.io and manage your notifications. You can set up smartphone and e-mail notifications in just a few clicks.

Status LED light
The status LED indicates the different operating modes. It gives you a subtle blink when Snipy is triggered.

Sadly, because it was a custom piece it was non refundable and we were not able to view the flawed design before hand. That being said we have been quietly working on a project with one of the largest wholesalers of gold, silver and diamond jewelry in Canada. We are about to launch a custom name pendant project.

Our basic model will be 925 silver, plated with white/yellow 18 karat gold and will come with a chain made in equivalent metals. We will also have custom name pendant in solid gold (10k/14k/18k/22k) with real diamonds as well as any precious stones you may desire.

</div></div>","Introducing GIOVARE™  After a year of development, we are finally ready to present to you our best product yet... The Premium Everyday Clutch, made with High Quality Genuine Italian Nappa-Leather,Splash-Proof, Not Easily Scratched and giving you more protection with RFID Blocking Materials. It's designed to satisfy the needs of a diverse range of lifestyles and professions. As RFID radio transmission technology is becoming increasingly widespread in passports, credit cards, debit cards, identity cards, key cards, and access control cards, the risks of “electronic pick-pocketing” (identity and personal data theft, payment fraud, and unintentional contactless payment) are on the rise. We've designed this wallet with a special lining to help protect the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chips in your credit and debit cards from unwarranted scanning. 


 

The ultimate in simple and convenient design. Keep your everyday small essentials in one place, safe and snug. Fit your life into a single pocket.

<h3>Our Vision</h3>
<p>These limited-edition enamel lapel pins are wearable statements to help cope with the current toxic political environment; pieces to express hope and strength. Pins from reSISTERS are pretty and meaningful things to wear, and maybe even a new way to break the ice and connect with like-minded strangers! </p>
<p>In addition to providing people with beautiful trinkets to express their beliefs, this project is a creative outlet for us to stay positive, motivated, and engaged. The proceeds from each sale will be donated to support an important and timely social cause through reputable organizations that are advocating for and protecting marginalized groups. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Who are reSISTERS?</h3>
<p>We're two friends (Tameeka &amp; Rachel) who live in New York City. We met about a decade ago at work. Between us, our professional lives have spanned design, sales, marketing, and management. We're ladies that get things done, and this time we're using our skills to guide a passion project.</p>
<p>If you back our project, you're a reSISTER too! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Plan</h3>
<p>We are crowdfunding for our initial start-up costs of $2,200. If we meet our goal, the money raised will be used to manufacture most, if not all of the designs you see here. We are also working on more designs for which we will fund production with our initial sales. In addition to producing the pins, money raised will go towards packaging, promotion, and of course, donations to social causes that need the support now more than ever. </p>
<p>This campaign is to fund production and get things stared. Once the designs are produced, we will sell the pins online. All proceeds from these sales will be donated. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Potential Challenges</h3>
<p>We will have to order minimum quantities for each design. If we are unable to fund all of the minimums up front, we may not be able to produce all of the designs right away. We may need to follow a scaled approach where we sell a few preliminary designs to fund more designs. We also will need to invest time in promotion, through social media, and with our contacts in various influential communities to generate interest. </p>
<p>In the event that we reach only 25% of our goal by the end of our campaign, we will donate the all funds to the social causes we have selected for this project; this includes Planned Parenthood, ACLU,The TREVOR PROJECT, SPLC, etc. If we reach only 50% of our goal we will still produce the Exclusive Normalize Empathy Teal Pin for our backers who donated $20 or more. Any leftover funds will be donated. </p>

</div></div>","Our Story Launching THE Perfect Pencil Skirt debut collection, WRITTEN Apparel aims to embrace the classic pencil skirt style and silhouette while elevating the design through high quality sewing, unique luxury fabrics, and attention to detail. In addition, we are going to put Iowa on the fashion map by staying true to the core values of authenticity, quality, beauty, originality, and innovation that we are grounded upon.
We will take the industry by storm with our selling model by offering more frequent collections. This means that you are going to be able to see what you can buy RIGHT NOW and wear our trend-aligned pencil skirts as they arise.
The ""Re-Writing the Pencil Skirt"" campaign has been created to provide WRITTEN Apparel with the resources to produce and market the debut collection. We are going to rewrite the script in the fashion industry by launching a high quality women's clothing label from Iowa and paving a way for other designers in the state to recognize that they can do it too.


What We Need & What You Get

We are seeking a $25,000 funding goal and orders for the debut collection. Funding raised will be used as seed capital for the domestic (Made in the USA) production of the debut collection. Production costs include all of the beautiful fabrics we've selected, high quality trims/notions, and branding elements.  We will use any remaining funds to market the brand (retail partnerships and e-commerce), development of the sophomore collection, and related travel. Any orders placed through the campaign will help us validate and ensure that we are creating the very best pencil skirt in the market. 
For this campaign we are offering several amazing rewards for our supporters; these include significant discounts on the debut collection pencil skirts, a special edition pencil skirt created only for campaign contributors, custom pencil skirt vouchers, style guides, fashion illustrations of the collection, and one-on-one style sessions with WRITTEN Founder, Emily Carlson.
We hope that you will recognize our passion for the success of the WRITTEN brand, however, if we do not reach our funding goal, we will prioritize the use of funds raised towards the production of the debut collection and scale back our marketing and travel costs accordingly.

Why the Pencil Skirt? 
The pencil skirt has been a staple in beautiful women's wardrobes for decades; Its longevity in the market, while other styles have come and gone, is due to its figure-flattering silhouette and elegant sensuality. We will keep these characteristics true while elevating the pencil skirt by adding unique detailing and luxury fabrics that will become signature to the WRITTEN brand. By designing and developing only pencil skirts as a young brand, we are able to narrow our focus and specialize in doing it very well. This method allows for more organic growth into other products and markets in the future



WRITTEN Apparel aims to consistently deliver new and unique iterations of the pencil skirt while maintaining quality and production standards from collection to collection. The pencil skirt has always been a wardrobe staple for some women, but we want to show that it can be styled and worn just as easily as a pair of blue jeans to fit EVERY woman's lifestyle and story.

<p>""Being raised by two very fashionable parents, I naturally gained an interest in fashion. However, upon exiting college and being thrown out into the ""real world"" I quickly discovered that there wasn't much of a fashion Industry in my hometown of Detroit, MI, and to start my path in the industry I had to move. However, there was one HUGE problem, New York and LA were much too expensive for my budget. Therefore, I ventured south realizing yet again there wasn't much of a fashion industry there either, but why?</p>
<p>Each region of the US has their own style and esthetics so shouldn't there be some sort of fashion market specializing in product within a given region? Sure, there are regional trade shows, local shops, and boutiques but how exactly are these boutiques sourcing their product and what is it costing them to do so between paying travel and shipping fees?</p>
<p>Moreover, Trade Show cost increase consistently year over year, causing many independent brands not to attend, going unseen by prospective buyers. </p>

<p><b>Fact 1: </b>Tradeshows are a great way to meet with new and existing brands in the same place, but with the high cost and consumption of time many attendees are opting out. </p>
<p><i>A survey of trade show attendees by the Center for Exhibition Industry Research (CEIR) concluded that inconvenient venues and high costs were by far the main reasons given by attendees for their decision not to attend shows. 60% of respondents stated that Location and Travel time were their reasons for not attending, while 43% listed cost. <a href=""http://www.tradeshowexecutive.com/archive/industry-news/location-cost-cited-top-reasons-not-attending/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">(</a></i><i><a href=""http://www.tradeshowexecutive.com/archive/industry-news/location-cost-cited-top-reasons-not-attending/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Anderson, Hil.

<p><b>Fact 2: </b>There is a need in the market for more than technology</p>
<p><i>As technology evolves wholesalers are seeking out ways to utilize technology in their businesses.

<p>MATE Showroom seeks to foster long lasting relationships between brands and retailers through detailed analysis and personalized selection within an online setting. </p>
<p><b>Personal and Online? Kind of an oxymoron, right? </b></p>
<p>Not Exactly, MATE will primarily operate online relieving brand partners of high monthly showroom cost, yet still maintaining a close client brand relationship. Hosting an online platform will simply streamline buying processes such as sample request, line sheets and ordering, allowing more time to spend on the fun stuff like establishing connections and product.  </p>
<p><b>So where exactly does the personal come in?</b></p>
<p>Each client will be partnered with an Account Manager who will then use their vetting skills to vet through brands to match them with potential retailers. </p>
<p>The MATE team will regularly add to the partner database by consistently seeking out new qualified buyers and brands. There is no one size fits all, our team will seek out retailers that best fit the brand and vise versa. This is extremely exciting for Buyers being that this will eliminate misdirected solicitations. </p>
<p>Many retailers lack the time to vet through new designers, and therefore rely on existing relationships, limiting emerging designers from making an impact in the market. Each Retailer will have the ability to create a profile that will be used to analyze their businesses. This information will then be used to match retailers with Brands that align specifically with the retailers needs. </p>
<p>Due to limited experience and funds many new brands lack the reach to be able to connect with retailers and also lack knowledge in what information needs to be presented to retailers therefore disqualifying them before their line is even viewed. A MATE Rep will work with the brand to established their line within the market through Wholesale Sales Representation, Distribution planning, and Branding all within an online platform. </p>

""Being raised by two very fashionable parents, I naturally gained an interest in fashion. However, upon exiting college and being thrown out into the ""real world"" I quickly discovered that there wasn't much of a fashion Industry in my hometown of Detroit, MI, and to start my path in the industry I had to move. However, there was one HUGE problem, New York and LA were much too expensive for my budget. Therefore, I ventured south realizing yet again there wasn't much of a fashion industry there either, but why?
Each region of the US has their own style and esthetics so shouldn't there be some sort of fashion market specializing in product within a given region? Sure, there are regional trade shows, local shops, and boutiques but how exactly are these boutiques sourcing their product and what is it costing them to do so between paying travel and shipping fees?
Moreover, Trade Show cost increase consistently year over year, causing many independent brands not to attend, going unseen by prospective buyers. 
Thats where MATE comes in... We want MATE to be the go to source for finding brands that meet voids in our buyers assortment regardless of their location or budget.""

Fact 1: Tradeshows are a great way to meet with new and existing brands in the same place, but with the high cost and consumption of time many attendees are opting out. 
A survey of trade show attendees by the Center for Exhibition Industry Research (CEIR) concluded that inconvenient venues and high costs were by far the main reasons given by attendees for their decision not to attend shows. 60% of respondents stated that Location and Travel time were their reasons for not attending, while 43% listed cost. (Anderson, Hil. ""Location, Cost Cited As Top Reasons For Not Attending."" Trade Show Executive ::. N.p., 4 June 2014. Web. 07 Apr. 2016.)
Fact 2: There is a need in the market for more than technology
As technology evolves wholesalers are seeking out ways to utilize technology in their businesses. Although there is a need for technology to streamline processes the art of selling requires more than what computer data can generate. (Barr, Bobb. ""What B2B Organizations Should Know About Personalization."" 01/18/2016. N.p., n.d. Web. 07 Mar. 2016.)
   
  
MATE Showroom seeks to foster long lasting relationships between brands and retailers through detailed analysis and personalized selection within an online setting. 
Personal and Online? Kind of an oxymoron, right? 
Not Exactly, MATE will primarily operate online relieving brand partners of high monthly showroom cost, yet still maintaining a close client brand relationship. Hosting an online platform will simply streamline buying processes such as sample request, line sheets and ordering, allowing more time to spend on the fun stuff like establishing connections and product.  
So where exactly does the personal come in?
Each client will be partnered with an Account Manager who will then use their vetting skills to vet through brands to match them with potential retailers. 
The MATE team will regularly add to the partner database by consistently seeking out new qualified buyers and brands. There is no one size fits all, our team will seek out retailers that best fit the brand and vise versa. This is extremely exciting for Buyers being that this will eliminate misdirected solicitations. 
Many retailers lack the time to vet through new designers, and therefore rely on existing relationships, limiting emerging designers from making an impact in the market. Each Retailer will have the ability to create a profile that will be used to analyze their businesses. This information will then be used to match retailers with Brands that align specifically with the retailers needs. 
Due to limited experience and funds many new brands lack the reach to be able to connect with retailers and also lack knowledge in what information needs to be presented to retailers therefore disqualifying them before their line is even viewed. A MATE Rep will work with the brand to established their line within the market through Wholesale Sales Representation, Distribution planning, and Branding all within an online platform.
