<div>Welcome to our campaign! I am Ravi, this is Sarah, and we are two passionate, highly skilled Registered Nurses heading to Lesvos, Greece to lend a hand to the incoming refugees.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Lesvos is experiencing a humanitarian crisis. People are fleeing their homes to find safe refuge in Europe, and their whole journey is filled with danger. Aid organizations and the Greek government are unable to cope with the 125,000 people arriving monthly.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><i>Local volunteers and tourists have stepped up to help, and we want to be a part of it. </i></div>
<div><i><br/></i></div>
<div>Our friend, who is working on the ground in Lesvos, sent us a message one night and said that a boat just arrived with 10 unconscious children on and that there was a call for anyone who knew CPR to get to the harbour. </div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>Your funds will go to:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>1) <b>Emergency Medical Supplies - Dehyrdration</b>: Dehydration is a killer. We will be <i>buying water, oral rehydration salts, and oral syringes</i> for child refugees as they come off the boats.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>2) <b>Emergency Medical Supplies - Hypothermia</b>: Sometimes coming over in dinghies, refugees are exposed to the elements and often travelling at night-time when the wind and rain are ferocious. We will be buying <i>blankets, dry clothing (socks, underwear, trousers, hats, gloves, shoes, sleeping bags, tents) and emergency foil blankets </i>to bring body temperature back to normal. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>3) <b>Emergency Medical Supplies - Medical Supplies</b>: Medical needs can be complex and acute. We will be buying <i>medicine, first aid kits, wound dressing packs and simple pain relief. </i>
</div>
<div><i><br/></i></div>
<div>All supplies, where possible, will be purchased in Greece to <i>support the local economy. </i>An important principle in international humanitarian work is to purchase goods and services locally.

I work with high school students in a rural community of Northern Nicaragua where there are few resources to support the teaching English process. Unlike many classrooms in other parts of the world, students don't have access to dictionaries in class or a public library where they could study. </p>
<p>Having resources like workbooks, dictionaries or videos will motivate the students during class and give them extra opportunities to practice their English, an important skill for future employment. These resources will not only impact current students but the ones that are to come. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p>I am looking to raise 500 dollars to buy materals for my  classes. I wiil use the money in the following way:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>$180 for dictionaries (30 dictionaries at $6/each)</li>
<li>$300 for workbooks and videos for the 5 levels of class</li>
<li>$20 for transport</li>
</ul>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>In the community where I work the people there do not have money to buy their own books. Having a classroom set of dictionaries and workbooks with enhance the learning experience and motivate students to participate in class. Not only will the students increase their English abilities, but they will also grow in their love of learning. They will be able to investigate and practice English like they never have before. In the future we are going to have students that are ready to communicate with foreign visitors to our community and our region. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Challenges</h3> <p>Once we have the books in the classroom it will be important to make the students aware of the proper use and care of the materials so that we have them for years to come. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Don´t forget to share this project with friends, family or educators that might be willing to donate! Thank you for your support! </p>

Having resources like workbooks, dictionaries or videos will motivate the students during class and give them extra opportunities to practice their English, an important skill for future employment. These resources will not only impact current students but the ones that are to come.    What We Need I am looking to raise 500 dollars to buy materals for my  classes. I wiil use the money in the following way:


$180 for dictionaries (30 dictionaries at $6/each)
$300 for workbooks and videos for the 5 levels of class
$20 for transport

    The Impact In the community where I work the people there do not have money to buy their own books. Having a classroom set of dictionaries and workbooks with enhance the learning experience and motivate students to participate in class. Not only will the students increase their English abilities, but they will also grow in their love of learning. They will be able to investigate and practice English like they never have before. In the future we are going to have students that are ready to communicate with foreign visitors to our community and our region. 
    Challenges Once we have the books in the classroom it will be important to make the students aware of the proper use and care of the materials so that we have them for years to come.

The Impact that WE can Have Together
 This campaign will help us address two major issues among our youth:Access to Higher Education
Over 17.4 million students are enrolled in college
Yet, college admissions is more competitive than ever before (2013 stats)

Acceptance rates at the top 50 U.S. business schools are lower also
Because getting accepted (even with a scholarship) is so ultra-competitive, the interview has become even more important now
Youth Unemployment 
In the USA, youth unemployment was 13.2% in May 2014 (overall: 6.3%)  Youth make up 40% of the world's unemployed with 12.6% global UE rate Youth Unemployment has become South Africa's most critical challenge

Youth Unemployment is not only a problem in the USA and South Africa, but also in Australia, Great Britain, Italy, China and other countries
With more Baby Boomers retiring each year, replacing them in the job market has become even more competitive globally - putting more emphasis on the interview to help one differentiate from the competition   The Bottom Line Even if our young people have all the necessary education and skills to perform well, because there is a limited supply of available jobs, competition is so intense and cutthroat, and they have to figure out a better way to differentiate themselves so they have a better chance to get the job.  This also applies to higher education, where our students are competing with their counterparts from all around the world for spots at the same institution.  To get accepted into your dream school, you have to stand out from the crowd.  In 2014, one of the best ways to stand out from the crowd, whether you're applying to go to school or to get a job, is to ACE your interview.  There's not much discussion about how to ACE your interview vs. how to craft your resume or how to study for the SAT / ACT / GMAT.  Through Magnetic Interviewing, I created something that I wished I had when I was applying to schools, scholarships, internships and jobs.  It is the culmination of years of trial-and-error, much research, and best practices learned from others.  I want to be able to provide this to at least 12,000 young people over the next 12 months and grow that number this time next year.  However, I cannot do this on my own.  I am asking for your support - whether by selecting a perk on the RIGHT side of THIS page, coupled with a financial contribution, or by sharing this campaign with others who may be interested.     Other Ways YOU Can Help We appreciate ALL contributions - whether $1 or $6,000.  However, if you are not in a position to contribute financially, YOU can still help us out:

If you're on Twitter and need a sample tweet to use (feel free to edit to your liking), try one of these also (copy & paste): Let's Give 12,000 #Millennials the Gift of a Better #Interview.  Check out & SUPPORT this cool @Indiegogo campaign: www.Help12K.comI just supported this @Indiegogo campaign to #Help12K #Millennials to ACE their #Interviews.  Check it out here: www.Help12K.com  Thank you so much for supporting this campaign & spreading the word!! :)""If you're not making someone else's life BETTER, then you're wasting your time.  YOUR life will become better by making other lives better."" -- Will SmithFAQWhy Indiegogo?  Why fund this project with crowdfunding?This campaign is about our young people.  Before we consider any angel, seed or venture capital funding, we believe that the first line of support should come from our community of young people and those who believe in the future of our young people.  Can you describe to me what Magnetic Interviewing is?Magnetic Interviewing, LLC is a for-profit social enterprise that focuses on helping young people ace their interviews so they can get accepted into their dream schools and get hired at their dream jobs and internships. Why help 12,000 young people?  How will you help them?When this social enterprise was created, I had a vision of having a significant impact in the lives of MANY young people.  Success to me, in our first 12 months of operation, is to help at least 12,000 young people ACE their interviews so they can get ACCEPTED into their dream schools and / or get HIRED for their dream jobs and internships.  That comes out to about 1,000 young people per month on average.  This is a goal that, with your support, we can achieve in our first 12 months not only through our online offerings but also through collaborating with local high schools, community colleges, colleges & universities, graduate schools, career centers, college & career guidance counselors, complimentary businesses and non-profit organizations.  YOUR support will help us achieve OUR mission.Which interviews have YOU aced using the principles and strategies behind Magnetic Interviewing? From using the best practices and strategies within Magnetic Interviewing, I have received acceptance and job offers from such places as:
Harvard University (with Navy ROTC scholarship)
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (Morehead-Cain scholarship)
Yale University
Brown University
University of Pennsylvania
University of California - Los Angeles (UCLA)
Goldman Sachs
One Economy Corporation
Citigroup
Harvard Business School
The Wharton School (University of Pennsylvania MBA program)
In full disclosure, to prevent any potential confusion, this campaign and Magnetic Interviewing are not affiliated, endorsed or supported by any of the above institutions, companies or organizations.Why not wait until after you complete business school to start this?With me being in school for two years, our upcoming high school juniors and seniors are at risk of not having the opportunity to learn these strategies and best practices to help increase their chances of acing their interviews to get into their dream schools.  That's two years worth of thousands of college students who would not potentially have access to this information before they apply to fall / summer internships and part-time / full-time jobs during school and after graduation.Our young professionals looking to go back to school or applying to their next job would be better off if they had this available to them in 2014 vs. 2016.  The information is ready to be shared with those young people willing to invest in themselves and their careers to get what they want.  Two years' deferral represents two years' of missed opportunities for thousands of young people. We don't want to risk that.",5.0,2,"1 Campaign

Recently, I learned about the organization called Students Helping Honduras (SHH) from a friend of mine. He went on a service trip with SHH over the summer, and now I would like to go on that same trip during the Winter session (December 27, 2014-January 3, 2015).

I will be flying from New York City to San Pedro Sula. The cost of the roundtrip flight currently is approximately $933. All of the money raised through this campaign will be put towards the cost of the flights. If additional funds are raised, I will donate them to the organization Students Helping Honduras, or to one of its college student-run chapters in the United States.</p>
<p>All those who donate to my fundraising campaign will receive a personal thank you letter from me.

<p></p>
<p>Though this trip only lasts for 8 days, I hope to gain a greater sense of what it means to help others in very different circumstances than what I have seen at home, while also gaining valuable experience that will build on my already growing interest in public policy, human rights advocacy, education policy and reform, and history.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>While I have volunteered with food pantries, soup kitchens, and other non-profit groups that seek to empower the lives of the less fortunate, I lack the knowledge of what others experience on a daily basis in a developing country such as Honduras, where gang violence, drug trafficking, and other tremendous hardships have driven scores of children and young adults from their homes in recent years. Nor am I able to gage how best to assist those who are struggling to stay alive, fed, and protected in countries like Honduras.</p>
<p>I have also researched what sorts of things I might bear witness to while in the Honduran countryside. While gang violence and drug trafficking are major issues that exist in the country, the work that I hope to be doing while there is not near where these problems are most severe.</p>

<p>Jeg har arbejdet hårdt og målrettet i mange år, for at kunne få min drømmeuddannelse, en uddannelse hvor jeg kan lave det jeg brænder aller mest for; skuespillerfaget. Endelig har jeg fået chancen, indenfor det filmiske univers: Jeg er blevet optaget på en af verdens mest anerkendte filmskoler, beliggende i New York; <b>New York Film Academy.</b></p>

<div>Efter jeg blev optaget på NYFA, gennemgik jeg yderligere en audition, for at opnå et schollarship. Jeg kom igennem, og har fået bevilliget ialt 13000 $ (Et a' 8000 $ og et a' 5000$) til at kunne betale en del af min uddannelse med. </div>
<div>Da det er dyrt at tage en uddannelse i udlandet, har jeg søgt SU styrelsen, men de har valgt at give mig et afslag, så nu står jeg med en adgangsbillet til min drømmeuddannelse i hånden, et tilskud fra USA, og har taget et lån i banken. På samme tid arbejder jeg alt hvad jeg kan for at lægge penge fra, men jeg mangler stadig lidt hjælp fra en ven, eller to..</div>

<li>Ialt har jeg brug for: $21.551 for at nå mit mål.</li>
<li>Pengene vil gå direkte til at betale min uddannelse, og de udgifter der er forbundet hertil. (Tuition, Visum, etc.)</li>

<li>Min plan er at arbejde hård, og sparre alt hvad jeg kan, for at få det her til at lykkes. Jeg tager alle de ekstra jobs der kommer min vej, og jeg holder hovedet højt. </li>

Alt der skal til for at jeg kan få min uddannelse, er 21.551. mennesker der alle har lyst til at donere 1$ til min kampagne, svarende til knap 5.50 danske kroner. Lykkes det, får jeg mit livs mulighed, og en fremtid indenfor scenekunsten.


Lidt om Mig: 
Mit navn er Laila Faris. Jeg er 23 år gammel, og bor i Aalborg- Danmark. Jeg er født og opvokset i Danmark, hos en dansk plejefamilie. Mine rødder er halv Libanesisk og halv irakisk, hvilket sammen med min danske attitude, og tilgang til livet bliver til: MIG.
Jeg er:


Danser
Skuespiller
En ildflue
En ballerina 
En prinsesse 
En porcelænsfigur 
En løve
En arbejder af hjertet
Fyldt med energi, Nysgerrighed og lysten til at lære.

Jeg har arbejdet hårdt og målrettet i mange år, for at kunne få min drømmeuddannelse, en uddannelse hvor jeg kan lave det jeg brænder aller mest for; skuespillerfaget. Endelig har jeg fået chancen, indenfor det filmiske univers: Jeg er blevet optaget på en af verdens mest anerkendte filmskoler, beliggende i New York; New York Film Academy.

Hvad jeg har brug for - og hvad jeg kan gi igen: 
Efter jeg blev optaget på NYFA, gennemgik jeg yderligere en audition, for at opnå et schollarship. Jeg kom igennem, og har fået bevilliget ialt 13000 $ (Et a' 8000 $ og et a' 5000$) til at kunne betale en del af min uddannelse med. 
Da det er dyrt at tage en uddannelse i udlandet, har jeg søgt SU styrelsen, men de har valgt at give mig et afslag, så nu står jeg med en adgangsbillet til min drømmeuddannelse i hånden, et tilskud fra USA, og har taget et lån i banken. På samme tid arbejder jeg alt hvad jeg kan for at lægge penge fra, men jeg mangler stadig lidt hjælp fra en ven, eller to..

Ialt har jeg brug for: $21.551 for at nå mit mål.
Pengene vil gå direkte til at betale min uddannelse, og de udgifter der er forbundet hertil. (Tuition, Visum, etc.)
Hvis 21.551 mennesker donere $1 hver, kommer jeg i mål. For hver $ jeg modtager giver jeg til gengæld et kæmpe stort Shoutout: ""TAK""


Risiko og udfordringer

Penge er min udfordring lige nu. Jeg er kommet igennem nåleøjet, og har opnået optagelse på skolen. Jeg har lykkes med at få to store scholarships fra USA, og jeg arbejder hårdt som selvstændig frisør, for at tjene penge til at kunne bo og leve i udlandet i et år.
Min plan er at arbejde hård, og sparre alt hvad jeg kan, for at få det her til at lykkes. Jeg tager alle de ekstra jobs der kommer min vej, og jeg holder hovedet højt. 
Risikoen er, at jeg ikke får samlet nok penge ind, og derfor må udskyde min uddannelse med et halvt år.



Andre måder du kan hjælpe på: 


Nogen har måske ikke muligheden for at hjælpe økonomisk, men ved at gøre opmærksom på min kampange hjælper du mere end du tror. Jeg sætter utrolig meget pris på alt den hjælp jeg kan få, og takker alle der hjælper, ved enten at donere, eller gøre opmærksom på min kampange. TAK!

All the above - Now in English: I have a dream and I am reaching for it to be my reality but i need your help. 
All it takes is for 21.551 people to donate $1 .00 each  and I will have the opportunity of a lifetime - and  a future within the Arts. 

About me: 
My name is Laila Faris. I am 23 years old and live in Aalborg , Denmark. I'm born and raised in Denmark with a Danish foster family. My roots are half Lebanese and half Iraqi, with a Danish attitude..
I am:


a dancer
an actress 
a firefly
a ballerina 
a princess 
a porcelain figure 
a lion
a worker by heart 

and everything in between. 



I've worked my best to achieve an education within acting and finally I have  the chance to fullfill my life long dream of an education within acting for films at the New York Film Academy. 

What I Need & What You Get
I have been accepted at the New York Film Academy and I have already received  2 scholarships from NYFA based on my external audition in the total combined amount of $13,000.
Coming from Denmark I need to have funds in my acount for VISA purposes. Additionally I need to pay  the remainder of my tuition. - SU have turned down the education here in Denmark, so I need a little help from a friend. 


I need exactely $ 21,551  to reach my goal. 
The money will go directly towards my education at The New York Film Academy.

If 21.551 people give one dollar each then I will have reached my goal - and for each dollar I get - I will give the world a big shoutout ""THANKS""


Risks & Challenges
 
Money is my obstacle. I have applied and been accepted. Through an external audition I have been granted a scholarship for part of my education.  I am currently working hard as a hairdresser to make enough money for my living expenses while I am studying the U.S.   My plan is to work hard and save all that I can to make my dream into my reality. I take all the extra jobs that I can and I am keeping my spirit high.

Introduction:
 


The first MSF was held on March 15, 2014. It was opened to all Michigan students and also Malaysian students based in other universities across the United States. We invited academics from various universities in the United States to discuss on the national education system, the economic policies of 1Malaysia and the political landscape after the 13th General Election. After receiving overwhelmingly positive feedbacks from participants, speakers and sponsors, it will be a great honor for MiMSA to be given another opportunity in organizing the Malaysian Studies Forum 2015, this time with the theme Rediscovering Malaysia, Redefining Identities. 

    
Overview: 
 

Embracing the identity as a
multi-racial country since its independence from the British in 1957, Malaysia
has managed to impressively retain its racial and religious harmony, almost
without interruption. Nevertheless, for the nation to enjoy economic and social
prosperity in many years to come, it has to currently address some of its most
pressing problems. 
Through the University and College
University Act, Malaysian students in local universities are restrained from
participating in politically affiliated events. At the same time, Malaysia
adopts Common Law from the British but also recognizes the subordinate,
states-based Sharia Law, which is enforced by the respective state Islamic
authorities. In recent years, these agencies have displayed a rising
assertiveness in complying Muslims with the states’ Islamic enactments, hence
creating confusion among Malaysians on the scope of power entitled to them by
the Constitution of Malaysia.
Avoiding from falling deeper into
the middle income trap, Malaysia is actively pursuing policies to position
itself to be a high income nation by 2020; however, this comes at the expense
of arranging some national priorities that should be pursued sooner rather than
later. At the global stage, while Malaysia currently becomes a non-permanent
member of the UN Security Council, soon there will be discussions on whether
Malaysia should continue to pursue more prominent role in the international
stage. 
Together, these issues reflect
the need for Malaysia to reexamine its national identity, redefine its
priorities and reevaluate its past policies. It is the intention of us, the MSF
2015 working committee, to bring a more focused discussion that will shed light
on Malaysia’s recent developments.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

enough educational institutions teaching this discipline. The RFC has been playing a major role in searching
for and training talents that would be capable of narrating/expressing
Jordanian stories, in addition to granting these talented filmmakers hands on
experience that would enable them to work on any international film production.<br/><br/>
The filmmakers’ community is increasing in Jordan and the need for funding has become
more pressing for them to realize their projects. Subsequently, the RFC has
designed a new program - the Educational Feature Film (EFF) program - that
gives emerging Jordanian filmmakers a chance to tell their stories, under the
supervision of mentors.

</p>
<p><span>The EFF is
structured as a workshop, whereby the RFC brings in experienced professionals
that work with filmmakers in the phases of production, cinematography, editing and
scriptwriting. The program is open to Jordanian writers or writers/directors,
regardless of their country of residence. It started in 2010 and helped produce
five films (see below).<span>  It was suspended
in 2013 due to shortage of funding. <br/></span></span></p>

production services to local, regional and international films shot completely

established various films centers that cater for beginners and professionals
alike. These opportunities encourage creativity, promote freedom of expression,
and enable filmmakers to tell their stories using the international cinema
language. This is achieved through
numerous workshops, seminars and discussion sessions on various aspects related
to filmmaking. “Rawi” is a highly-acclaimed annual screenwriting lab, open to
filmmakers from the region. Last but not least, the RFC organizes regular
screenings all year round in Amman and the rest of the country. </p>

<h3>Hello out there!</h3>
<p>  I am Coral and I have a super cute bestie named Kelly. Many years ago Kelly and I moved from Chicago to New York City to hit it big and become amazing New Yorkers with that special midwest charm. Kinda worked but we both ended up back in Chicago. Upon my departure I was given a gift certificate for American Airlines which helped fund one of my first trips back to Chicago and have yet to forget that great gift giving.</p>
<p>  When Kelly announced she was accepting Yale's generous offer to let her go to their school I thought to myself, ""Gosh wouldn't it be great if we could get Kelly back to Chicago a lot of times so we didn't miss her as much."" As panic set in about her pending departure I began researching effective and non-creepy ways to let her friends and family come together and give whatever amount they wanted to the Bring Kelly Back Project. Your donation will go toward a surprise gift certificate for an airline company to fly Kelly to see her friends and family. It's that easy!</p>
<p>  So here's your chance! $500 was the minimum goal I could set but I figured, what the hell let's give it a try! If you would rather buy her a cute vintage tea set she will then have to pack, break, and unpack, by all means go ahead. But if you prefer to sacrifice a silly whiskey drink you would be buying her on a night of many whiskey drinks and see her again soon, throw a couple bucks in the pot and email me your name and message to include in her card!</p>
<p>   If you are a stranger and reading this, just know Kelly is a one of a kind lady embarking on a long journey at Yale as a Dramaturgy Graduate student. What is dramaturgy you ask? Look it up because it's awesome and my description will do it no justice. Not only is she smart and ambitious, but she is also a master rapper (Rap name is MC Run-On), a messy eater, a fast reader, very quick, and probably one of the funniest people ever. Thank you!!!</p>

</div></div>","The Main Details:
(Highlighted and Underlined words are links, click for more information!)
My name is Malachi Phelps and i'm nothing if not an artist.

I'm from Aberdeen, WA

Have always wanted to spread messages of encouragement and growth through media and animation
My goal is to obtain an Masters in Fine Arts (Digital Technology and Culture) from the Pullman Washington State University campus
I totally killed it applying for scholarships, but the one thing I need help with is transportation. This is where you come in!


Let's Talk Specifics:
Here's a general breakdown of the travel mileage and expenses that will go into transporting my physical self, my computer, my rabbit, a bed set, and a mannequin from Aberdeen (western state border) to Pullman (eastern state border)!

U-Haul is fairly inexpensive as far as transportation trailers cost, but that isn't to say that it's going to be cheap. Here is a screenshot of an estimate I calculated, inputting my distance from Aberdeen to Pullman into their price predictor. Renting a U-Haul will cost an estimated $530, on top of the gas money that isn't added to that price.
Gas went down from $5 to $2.50 over the last decade and I am definitely NOT complaining, however I do have to do a bit of guesswork to estimate how much gas will cost, given that the size of trailer I plan to rent gets about 12 highway miles to the gallon. Let's see, 400 (miles) divided by 12 (miles per gallon) is about 33 (gallons of gas required for the trip). If 33 times 2.50 (dollars per gallon) is the correct equation here, then gas is going to cost about $85.


This site charges a 5% fee, it's understandable given that the hosts who are upkeeping the servers have mouths to feed themselves. A 5% chunk of my total requested funds is about $30. Compared to the total I'm racking up in hypothetical U-Haul fees, this isn't that much to ask.


What Donating Means to Me:
This degree means so much to me, not only because being an animator and storyboard artist has always been my dream job, but also because this career will support my financial goals to provide jobs for the impoverished people of my hometown, and to help support my community by giving back.
With this degree I can engage directly in the media that the next generation of Americans (and who knows, maybe even internationally!) will grow up with.

Sharing is caring. Please take time to share this campaign on your social media platform. Even if you can't donate yourself (which is entirely fine, I'm in no position to judge), then maybe someone in your friends list is able to instead. Who knows, life is unpredictable!

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Nearly 4 million of the 6.5 million children in the US who have disabilities are performing below grade level for reading and math. The adults who work with these children are increasingly overwhelmed by outdated systems, time-consuming tasks, and redundancy in the data being collected.

<ul>
<li>We are parents, teachers, and therapists of children that have had a special need (e.g. speech therapy) or an IEP plan for our children. We have set out to make it easier for us all to view, record and share relevant information about what's working or not working for a child so we can tailor the care and instruction to help children reach their goals.</li>
<li>We are raising money to complete product development activities that can help us get ready for our existing customer in the fall and bring on new ones into our private beta program.</li>

<p>The concept of AirSchool has developed over the last five years.  In order to bring solutions to families, children, and teachers to introduce and encourage the revolutionary technology that is available and to future proof children's education.</p>
<h3>Future Proof Education</h3>
<p>AirSchool is an environment where children are LEARNERS and not just students.  With children directing their own learning experiences, their inner geniuses will be awakened.  This is the future of education.  We are all born to be great, we just have to find where our greatness lies.</p>
<h3>Core Values of AirSchool</h3>
<ol>
<li>Being emotionally strong and prepared</li>
<li>Understand coding and embrace critical thinking</li>
<li>Being able to bring ideas into reality and understand money and monetization</li>
<li>Be the commander of your digital use in responsible and effective ways</li>
</ol>
<h3>The 5 Fundamentals</h3>
<ol>
<li>Emotional Engine</li>
<li>Coding and Critical Thinking</li>
<li>Biz for Kids</li>
<li>Financial Education</li>
<li>Digital Citizenship</li>
</ol>
<p>After completing the first stage, setting up the curriculums and site development that we had bootstrapped, we are now in need of your support to produce the courses in high quality and to accelerate the platform to the next stage.</p>
<p>Your contribution is important to the delivery of content to the families, children, and teachers who have been waiting for this program in order to deliver high quality and future proof education at affordable prices.</p>
</div><div>
<p>We are looking to raise $100,000 to develop the 5 fundamental courses in high quality at a professional level and also to develop further our platform to involve membership driven content.</p>
<p>Marketing and promoting the new ways of learning will be funded with the money raised.</p>
<p>Your contribution will be rewarded with special perks like AirSchool branded beanies, t-shirts, newest trending EDC spinner, and subscriptions to our content.</p>
<p>If we come short of the funding goal, our direction and commitment will not veer.  We will still bring this platform to its highest potential.  Willing to impact on the future of education for millions of children.</p>
<p>As we are aware, the current education system is out of date and instead of trying to change the system but rather enhance it.  However, changing the way we learn and by taking lead, we know the education system will be inspired enough to make appropriate changes of their own.</p>
<p>We must admit, our future will rely more and more on technology.</p>
<p>Our biggest challenge is being able to reach as many people as possible, ensuring that this will be a ""movement"" and not a ""moment"".  Making digital education affordable to as many people as possible.  Eventually, making our platform into an open source platform.</p>
</div><div>
<p>Over the last 5 years, we had great results with our live workshops.</p>
<p>Just in case at this moment you are not ready to provide with financial support, you can still give us amazing support by sharing our idea through your social network.  Help us to raise awareness too future proof your children's education.</p>

Ciao, sono Stefano Novelli, amministratore del portale Inforge.net . Da anni la mia passione sono Sicurezza Informatica e Ethical Hacking, ho pubblicato alcuni ebook sull'argomento e in passato ho collaborato alla stesura di alcuni articoli su Hacker Journal (nota rivista ormai defunta).
Ho sempre trovato affascinante il mondo della Sicurezza Informatica e degli Hackers che in passato (e ancora oggi) hanno rivoluzionato il modo in cui oggi vediamo con i nostri occhi l'Informatica; tuttavia ho avuto difficoltà negli ultimi anni a trovare documenti in lingua italiana esaustivi, spesso trattati con poca sufficienza da persone non adatte a farlo. Gli unici che valgono la pena di essere citati, sono libri altamente tecnici e costosi.
Seguendo la filosofia del software libero e dell'etica White Hat ho così deciso di avviare in passato un corso chiamato Hacklog, che raccoglie con video facilmente assimilabili da chiunque il meraviglioso mondo che gira attorno al mondo della Sicurezza Informatica e dell'Hacking Etico. 
Nel 2015 abbiamo arrestato la pubblicazione dell'Hacklog, studiando un nuovo modo di approcciare l'argomento, sviluppando un nuovo format e migliorando tutta la strumentazione a nostra disposizione.


Nel nuovo format sono necessari diversi strumenti, alcuni dei quali già recuperati (come un buon microfono, un mixer audio, una scheda video adeguata e tutto il software necessario), tuttavia abbiamo ancora bisogno di acquistare materiale adatto per toccare livelli mai visti prima!
Con i fondi ottenuti acquisteremo:

Source di elementi video per migliorare la spiegazione dei nostri corsi
Componenti Hardware che utilizzeremo per l'autocostruzione di portali di anonimato, chiavette USB per i test di Data Shredding e strumenti di test generali (ad es. lettori, hard disk etc...)
Pubblicità sui social network dove sponsorizzeremo il progetto

Se per qualche malaugurato motivo non riuscissimo a raggiungere il goal prefissato non sarà comunque un problema: il progetto non verrà abbandonato e cercheremo di completarlo virtualizzando gli argomenti che non riusciremo ad affrontare in reale.
Il rilascio di tutte le puntate è previsto per Gennaio 2017 (leggi note in fondo).
 

Abbiamo pensato per te alcune opzioni che possono ripagare il tuo impegno economico. Tieni presente che a tutte le opzioni presenti abbiamo dedicato sempre una piccola percentuale da destinare al progetto, così da non farlo diventare un mero lavoro d'ufficio!

Do not idle when thinking about buying, because you may never have the chance to experience this life changing soap again.

Lilac Meadow
Everyone wants a little sweetness in their life, so for those of you who enjoy the springtime season, you will enjoy a very sweet and springy soap scent. Our soap will leave your skin extra moisturized, so there’s no need to worry about dryness. Our team used four different oils, these oils have reacted with each other to create an extremely bubbly, cleansing, and moisturizing soap; for those of us who like to be bubbly in life.
White Ocean Rain
Made from scratch in our very own MHS building, introducing White Ocean Rain. This soap includes coconut exfoliants that add a texture and exotic feeling while you use it. White Ocean Rain is also capable of forming suds that help clean with ease while you use it. The smell isn’t just appealing, but also makes you smell amazing after each use.Cinnamon Bun




This swirled natural cinnamon bun soap smells like the real thing! Infused with real cinnamon this soap leaves your hands feeling soft and moisturized. Cinnamon bun soap will leave your hands smelling like an actual cinnamon bun without the sticky mess. For those of us who like the sweeter things in life, buy Cinnamon Bun soap!




SheyKa Soap
Want to go on a tropical vacation in your own home? No problem. SheyKa soap is what you need. With a watermelon and pineapple sent, it will take you straight to the Caribbean. Also, having a coconut exfoliant will make your experience even more tropical.

Warm Vanilla & Chocolate Swirl Soap


Our soap is a dual‐sided vegan bar. The rich brown top of the soap smells of chocolate with coffee grounds and coarse sugar for exfoliation. The bottoms is a natural white color that smells of warm vanilla with a few gold flakes to make the soap pop.  For best results, gently rub the exfoliant on your skin to remove dead skin and create a soft surface. Then, rub the conditioning vanilla side onto your skin to moisturize and condition your hands.


Salted Chocolate Strawberry
Olive, coconut, and palm oils combine with the scents of chocolate and strawberry to create a soap that smells good enough to eat and leaves skin feeling soft and clean. A sprinkle of sea salt exfoliates and invigorates the skin while oils soothe and moisturize.",14.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>I know, the situation</b> in Israel is
complicated and confusing; each group has its own story. Like Israel’s
Independence Day. For the Jewish population it is a day of joy and happiness,
marked by parties and festivity. For the Arab inhabitants it is one of the
darkest days in their history. Nevertheless, it is possible to spend this day

<p><b>If you do not know me,</b> let me introduce
myself. I have been writing for most of my life,  only in a professional capacity
in the past eight years since I moved to Israel. On a freelance basis, I write
for European newspapers and magazines, mainly human interest stories, because
that hardly gets any attention in the general media.  Israel feels like my homeland. My family always
had a stronger connection than with Holland, and most of our holidays, since I
was very young, were spent here.  I know
the country very well, even better since I moved here.  I write about my life in a weekly blog, and,
together with Esther Voet, director of the Center for Information and
Documentation on Israel, I wrote HotspOTs Israel 2014/2015 (available in eBook
and hard copy), in which we showcased Israel as a hip, hot and trendy country.</p>
<p><b>On to Peace Women.</b> I want the world to see
what I saw and still see and to be part of it as well.  To feel the joy and positive energies that
these women radiate in their work, not only through words but in photographs as
well.  These women have created initiative’s
that come from their hearts, regardless of their background, religion, color or
history.  That is why I decided to write Peace
Women, a book containing their stories to show the world how these women work together on various levels. In my opinion they are
the <i>real</i> peacemakers in the Middle
East.  Along with the book, there will be
a website, a lively place where all these women can meet and talk and exchange

<p><b>My dream?</b>  To show what is going on in Israel’s everyday
life, beneath the layers of politics, to bring out the personal stories of

begin to change the world and to create a different view of the Middle East. Peace
on a small scale can make a big difference.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/565737/files/20140508060308-Fauzia___Etti.jpg?1399554188"" src="""" style=""width: 320.74px; height: 240px;""/></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; font-style: italic;"">(</span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Fauzia &amp; Etty from The Jewish-Arab Center for Peace at Givat Haviva)</i></p><p></p><p><b>The book,</b> which will be available as an eBook

within us.  Peace Women shows us how you

complicated regions it is possible to live together, despite the differences in
cultural background, religion, or race. If they can do it, we all can!</span></p>
<p><b>Marieke
Timp (freelance photographer):</b> When Joanne asked me
to travel around Israel and take portrait pictures of these amazing women being
interviewed about the work they do, I did not hesitate. The interviews were
conducted in different languages and environments. We went to schools, senior
citizen homes, private homes, out in the olive fields, and more. Women of all
ages and backgrounds, all working for the same purpose, “a peaceful life living
together”. At first I did not understand most of what was said in the
interviews, as they speak mainly Hebrew and Arabic, but the emotions words that
were being spoken with their eyes and hands made me understand. </p>
<p><b>Cathelijne van de Bercken (graphic
designer):</b> What I love about Peace Women is the
colorful cooperation between women with completely different cultural
backgrounds and religions. Their wonderful work results in peace. As a graphic
designer, I think it is a beautiful challenge to translate this palette of
colorful stories into a visual representation in the form of the design of the
book. </p>
<p><b>Noortje Giladie-Grootscholten (web
designer):</b> I am part of Peace Women because I
believe that peace in the Middle East (or anywhere for that matter) will only
exist when we can live and let live; when we respect, accept, and open up; when
we realize that things like looks, religion, and our background really do not
make us more or less (human). The stories told by the Peace Women are a
beautiful illustration of exactly that! </p>
<p><b>David Israëls (strategic advisor):</b> Peace Women shows us that ethnicity and religion are not barriers
to living with each other: a whole new view of the reality!</p>

about three years ago, I have often been told that I am naïve and unrealistic.
The more it was said, the more I became convinced that I am on the right track.
Peace Women will be the start of a new process, where optimism and respect for
each other will change the world forever by learning about each other, by
learning and working with each other, by realizing that we cannot live without each
other. Each of these women deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for their courage in
creating a different tomorrow. Join me through your donation, so that we can
bring their stories to the world!
Because I value all donations, not matter the
amount, I will thank each and every one of you on the website. From €50 and more, you'll be the first to receive a copy of the e-book.  There will also be a special acknowledgements page in the
book. If you give €1.000 or more, I would like to offer you a few
possibilities.  Either, when you are in
Israel, I will show you around and introduce you to one of these wonderful
projects, or I can deliver a speech about my book, either via Skype or
‘live’.  
Some helpful instructions for funding: You’d like to contribute? Great! Find that big pink button on the
right that says CONTRIBUTE NOW - click it! Below ""How much would you like
to contribute?"", you enter the amount you wish to donate. (The default
amount is €100, but that is just a suggestion from Indiegogo; you are, of
course, free to donate as much as you like). Enter your email address and click
CONTINUE TO PAYMENT. Click GO TO PAYPAL - don't worry, on PayPal’s site you can
pay with your credit card or PayPal account. If you have a PayPal account, log in
and proceed as usual. If you want to pay with your credit card you click below
on ""Pay with a credit or debit card"". Fill out the required details
et voila! Thank you for your donation!
I would like to introduce you to the
people who help me:
Marijn Schrieken (project manager):I believe that peace is universal, it is
within us.  Peace Women shows us how you
can implement peace in your life, that even in one of the world’s most
complicated regions it is possible to live together, despite the differences in
cultural background, religion, or race. If they can do it, we all can!
Marieke
Timp (freelance photographer): When Joanne asked me
to travel around Israel and take portrait pictures of these amazing women being
interviewed about the work they do, I did not hesitate. The interviews were
conducted in different languages and environments. We went to schools, senior
citizen homes, private homes, out in the olive fields, and more. Women of all
ages and backgrounds, all working for the same purpose, “a peaceful life living
together”. At first I did not understand most of what was said in the
interviews, as they speak mainly Hebrew and Arabic, but the emotions words that
were being spoken with their eyes and hands made me understand. 
Cathelijne van de Bercken (graphic
designer): What I love about Peace Women is the
colorful cooperation between women with completely different cultural
backgrounds and religions. Their wonderful work results in peace. As a graphic
designer, I think it is a beautiful challenge to translate this palette of
colorful stories into a visual representation in the form of the design of the
book. 
Noortje Giladie-Grootscholten (web
designer): I am part of Peace Women because I
believe that peace in the Middle East (or anywhere for that matter) will only
exist when we can live and let live; when we respect, accept, and open up; when
we realize that things like looks, religion, and our background really do not
make us more or less (human). The stories told by the Peace Women are a
beautiful illustration of exactly that! 
David Israëls (strategic advisor): Peace Women shows us that ethnicity and religion are not barriers
to living with each other: a whole new view of the reality!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

You can make a difference in making sure that precious time in a student's life is constructive, productive and enjoyed!</p><p>New York City's Education system is extremely competitive. Your contribution helps lessen the gap between opportunity and achievement for diverse groups of children. </p><ul><li>The program has grown from one child to 15 children, all working with me individually in
the space of four terms. This coming school year, with the addition of small groups, I forecast consistent and significant expansion. Students lessons and strong parental involvement combined with the sharing of ideas within communities can be extremely powerful in shifting and growing the likelihood of excellence.</li></ul><ul><li><p>Some
students focus on logic skills specifically for school admissions. Other
students work on honing skills they already possess and on specified academic
subjects to excel and to keep themselves challenged. All of my academic
students are now working on at least a full year ahead of their grade level. The students
working on school admissions have qualified for top tier schools, both public
and private - scoring an average thus far of 97% on admissions standardized tests.  </p></li></ul><ul>
<li><p>Opportunity
and exposure for developing young citizens are the main motivators behind
this program. A consulting component and presence in lower income public schools could really help diversify well performing and specialized schools in the city. It will also provide exposure and inspiration to schools, which may not be using all of their resources. You would be a huge part of this transformation!</p></li>
<li><p>Your contribution will help provide materials to develop specific and precise academic behaviors and abilities in a diverse population of students. It will provide scholarship opportunities for middle and lower income students, provide additional assessments to develop top quality individualized lesson planning and, as always, an on-site environment that is stimulating, welcoming and productive.</p></li>
<li><p> All children have so much potential! Developing an environment where the parents and schools support the students to stretch the limits of their personal ability is key to creating a culture of excellence and achievement in any setting. You would be a part of such a specific, wonderful and forward reaching movement. Thank you!!</p></li>

I will work with children, who it seems would best benefit from the additional stimulation, in small groups. Early Prep Plus, with more marketing and abundant materials can serve a more diverse population. In time, more great teachers can get involved and learn the curriculum to follow through with this movement.  You can be a huge part of promoting academic excellence in diverse settings.All children with support and guidance can achieve so much! I can help them with your support.What We Need & What You GetEarly Prep Plus needs approximately $40,000 to carry on for the next 2 school years. This campaign is just for $19,950 with the hope of going over! This is the amount that you can have such an integral part in building!Rather than asking for 3 years for covering expenses as most start ups do, I'm asking for funds for specific needs!The total $19,950 will go towards:

Scholarship fund for sliding scale students: *$3000

Annual Marketing: *$3,000

Professional web design: *$5000

Books, supplies, media subscriptions annual: *$3000
Professional development. Staying abreast of current and cutting edge education programs (1 to 2 classes annual): *$4550
Fees accrued from Paypal & Indiegogo
Other day to day expenditures that go with running a freelance business are proudly all my own. This is a wonderful adventure!
As a perk, you can choose to have your name or company name posted on the Early Prep Plus site as an appreciated supporter, receive artwork, have an assessment performed on a new student, get a shout out on Facebook and/or enjoy some Starbucks coffee! 
And It's Also My Birthday Wish!!!!
Thank you!!

The ImpactAges 3 - 9 are the crucial years for so much opportunity! Every moment of their day counts. You can make a difference in making sure that precious time in a student's life is constructive, productive and enjoyed!New York City's Education system is extremely competitive. Your contribution helps lessen the gap between opportunity and achievement for diverse groups of children. The program has grown from one child to 15 children, all working with me individually in
the space of four terms. This coming school year, with the addition of small groups, I forecast consistent and significant expansion. Students lessons and strong parental involvement combined with the sharing of ideas within communities can be extremely powerful in shifting and growing the likelihood of excellence.Some
students focus on logic skills specifically for school admissions. Other
students work on honing skills they already possess and on specified academic
subjects to excel and to keep themselves challenged. All of my academic
students are now working on at least a full year ahead of their grade level. The students
working on school admissions have qualified for top tier schools, both public
and private - scoring an average thus far of 97% on admissions standardized tests.  
Opportunity
and exposure for developing young citizens are the main motivators behind
this program. A consulting component and presence in lower income public schools could really help diversify well performing and specialized schools in the city. It will also provide exposure and inspiration to schools, which may not be using all of their resources. You would be a huge part of this transformation!
Your contribution will help provide materials to develop specific and precise academic behaviors and abilities in a diverse population of students. It will provide scholarship opportunities for middle and lower income students, provide additional assessments to develop top quality individualized lesson planning and, as always, an on-site environment that is stimulating, welcoming and productive.
 All children have so much potential! Developing an environment where the parents and schools support the students to stretch the limits of their personal ability is key to creating a culture of excellence and achievement in any setting. You would be a part of such a specific, wonderful and forward reaching movement. Thank you!!

<h2>My Campaign</h2>
<p>My name is Christian Kettenbeil, and I have been making ""movies"" since I was 10 years old. I started out playing with my parents old camcorder, and soon earned enough money to get my own. Since then, my interest and love for anything having to do with film has skyrocketed, and I'm sure that is what I want to do in life.</p>
<p>Now that I am 17, college is looming on the horizon, and this summer is an extremely important time for me to make decisions, and start planning for when I graduate. I have had my heart set on USC's School of Cinematic Arts for a while now, and finally decided that this year I would plan my visit to really get a feel of what I can expect from life as a USC student. There is only one problem that is stopping me from achieving this dream, and that is: I have no money to make my visit.</p>
<p>Living more than 2000 miles away from my destination makes my visit more costly than most, and I need help funding it. Just a few months ago my Dad became unemployed for the second time in 2 years, and right around the same time, he was diagnosed with Colon Cancer, and now his medical bills are starting to pile up. My mother works almost everyday of the week to try and cover the expenses that are involved with just keeping a roof over my family's heads, and my college education is at the bottom of the list for things they are able to spend money on right now.</p>
<p>The start of my dream, and possibly my whole career, depends on if I can raise enough money to fund my visit in August, and <strong>you</strong> can help me :)</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What do I need this money for? And what am I doing to earn it?</h3>
If you travel you know how expensive things can get, and it seems as though the expenses never end. I'm in that situation. I have figured out the total for the essentials for my visit, which includes my round-trip flight, my stay in Los Angeles, and a car for my stay. I have researched the cheapest means of travel, and came to the harsh realization that I'm going to need at least $2500 to cover all of my expenses, and thats why I turned to fundraising as a means of reaching my goal.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I currently work at least 24 hours a week at my normal job, and complete side jobs in order to save some money for my visit. In addition to my online fundraising, I am going to be doing many can and bottle drives throughout my area to raise a little bit more money. I am also a straight 'A' student, and excell in the classroom. I'm relying on my grades to help me pay for college, in the form of scholarships. I am willing to do whatever it takes so that I can make my dream of attending USC a reality, and I'm hoping you can help me achieve that :)</div>

<h3>Hello, my name is Trevor W Goodchild aka Syllable, a teacher from Austin, Texas, currently attending the University of Texas for a Geography degree.  I also am a conscious hip hop artist called Syllable, and use hip hop as a vehicle of positive social change.  </h3>
<p><strong>Campaign</strong>:</p>
<p>My Geography degree is being defunded 2 semesters short of graduation, and i would love to not have to work at McDonalds with thousands in loan i can't pay back without a degree, so please help me raise the money to pay for a degree that will help me protect biodiversity, promote sustainability and do real work to make the world a better place.</p>

<p><strong>Break it down for folks in more detail:</strong></p>
<div>
<p>After making it off the streets as a homeless youth, against all odds into the Unversity of Texas, due to a new law in 2011 the Consolidated Appropriations Act, it is ironic now my future is threatened.  Pell Grant funding was cut from 18 to 12 semesters due to the Consolidated Appropriations Act, now my pell grant is 0, and I've reached the lifetime limit for unsubsidized and subsidized loans.  This means i am out of funding to complete the 120 hours of in residency hours UT requires for graduation.  This puts a chink into the whole plan for my life, career, music, and altruistic pursuits. </p>
<p>I am $15000 short of graduation.  Tuition is $5000 for a College of Liberal Arts major, textbooks at least $300 if not more, and living expenses of $900 rent, $100 electric bills, $50 phone bills.  Each semester is 5 months long.  Thats $10,000 just for living expenses, but i am teaching at AISD to alleviate this, though the pay is low for a teacher in Texas that is substitute teaching.  $20,000 (living expenses plus $5k for 2 semesters tuition) would cover it all, but i am only aiming for $15,000 because, honestly, it's hard for me to believe any of this will work, but i'm keeping my fingers crossed praying for a miracle.</p>
</div>
<p>I am a conscious hip hop artist and have done benefits for poets in jail, The Off Center with Rude Mechanicals, shows raising money to train seeing eye dogs for blind people, and rapped at Austin Community College's 36th anniversery.  Hip hop with a message like the Roots, similar to Bob Dylan, if he rapped lol, i educate and mobilize listeners to vote in local elections, recycle, take care of our kids better and make the world a better place through thoughtful participation in local communities everywhere.</p>
<p>Having had such a hardknock life, my heart opens extra big for anyone going thru adversity and by supporting me getting a degree you are helping countless people that i will help through my journey to live, love, and be the most compassionate human being possible with everything i do. </p>
<p>If i don't reach my goal, the money that i raise will go towards a vocational training, in a trade school, or apprentice under a master at a certain craft in order to have a skill that will put food on the table for my family, and secure a stable future.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I have used my time on Earth to volunteer teaching children to juggle, speaking at City Hall on behalf of unarmed minorities shot and killed by Austin Police Department (Jessie Owens, Daniel Rocha, Sophia King, Nathaniel Sanders Jr etc), Human Rights Commission, State Capital and so on. I have also volunteered at Casa Marianella, a homeless shelter for immigrants, cleaning, electrical, donations, folding dresses with bullet holes and blood stains from crossing the Texas-Mexico border. Real life stuff that isn't a media blitz but human beings hurting and benefiting from any help I'm glad to give.  I've been super involved in Austin's community to improve the conditions we live in and quality of life for the kids the improverished, and anyone going thru hard times like life has a soundtrack listening to When Doves Cry. </p>
<p>I am working class, below the poverty line, but i have a huge vision on how I will use a Geography degree to build a better world through traveling for geographic jobs, networking with nonprofits to connect resources to those in need, to supporting local businesses, and creating outreach programs for homeless youth.  But, it starts with getting a Geography degree, i want to go to Berkely for grad school but that doesn't seem likely now.  Perhaps with your help i can still work for National Geographic or another nature magazine that uses photography to raise awareness to help indigenous communities after getting a BA in Geography.  Anything helps, thank you!</p>

<p class=""lead"" style=""text-align: center;""><strong><span style=""font-size: large; font-family: arial black,avant garde;"">Zelosport Introduces New Sport and Competition to the Nation Advocating the Welfare of Families and Children!!!</span><em><br/></em></strong></p>
<h3>Spud Alford, founder and CEO of the parent company, Zelosport, stated that ""the National Finger Football League is off and running so it was just a natural progression to involve Finger Football fans nationwide.  I would guess that 95% of America’s population has at some time flicked a piece of paper or a pack of sugar across a table, whether in a lunchroom or a restaurant setting, hoping to score a touchdown by skillfully causing the object to rest with one portion of it hanging over the table’s edge. We simply took the concept to a whole new level.”<br/><br/>With the formation of the National Finger Football League, according to Spud, “It is the only national competition to my knowledge where a child, a parent and a grandparent in the same family and of either gender can compete together with an equal chance at winning.”</h3>
<h3><em><strong>Zelosport is a huge advocate of the family. But even more so, the company advocates the care of children with three main issues in mind: NO kid should ever leave his or her house in fear of being bullied; No kid should ever go to bed hungry; and EVERY kid deserves the right to be loved. The National Finger Football League will reach out to those kids across this country and identify them and make a place for them in a fun and wholesome environment. Your participation will make that a reality.</strong></em></h3>
<h3>A 12 city tour is projected to begin in the Fall 2013, with a test tour already held in 2011 - 2012 to work out the bugs.

</div></div>","Zelosport Introduces New Sport and Competition to the Nation Advocating the Welfare of Families and Children!!!
Spud Alford, founder and CEO of the parent company, Zelosport, stated that ""the National Finger Football League is off and running so it was just a natural progression to involve Finger Football fans nationwide.  I would guess that 95% of America’s population has at some time flicked a piece of paper or a pack of sugar across a table, whether in a lunchroom or a restaurant setting, hoping to score a touchdown by skillfully causing the object to rest with one portion of it hanging over the table’s edge. We simply took the concept to a whole new level.”With the formation of the National Finger Football League, according to Spud, “It is the only national competition to my knowledge where a child, a parent and a grandparent in the same family and of either gender can compete together with an equal chance at winning.”
Zelosport is a huge advocate of the family. But even more so, the company advocates the care of children with three main issues in mind: NO kid should ever leave his or her house in fear of being bullied; No kid should ever go to bed hungry; and EVERY kid deserves the right to be loved. The National Finger Football League will reach out to those kids across this country and identify them and make a place for them in a fun and wholesome environment. Your participation will make that a reality.
A 12 city tour is projected to begin in the Fall 2013, with a test tour already held in 2011 - 2012 to work out the bugs. The tour was sponsored by the great folks at White Castle and although White Castle will not be involved going forward, Zelosport and the NFFL are growing and establishing a player roster that will sustain the Finger Football Championship for generations to come.With a recent study showing that one of the things young people prefer to do most is spend time with their family (including video games), Zelosport will create an environment that is wholesome and fun allowing sports enthusiasts a chance to compete with and against their own family members.

Il tutto anche grazie al sostegno di un maestro orafo che si chiama Tito Livio Negri. <br/>A settembre del 2013 sono andata a Murano a studiare le basi della tecnica di lavoro del vetro al lume, col maestro Davide Penso, possibilità che mi è stata data grazie ad un munifico regalo di compleanno. (Per capire di che si tratta quardate questo mio <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZPwrZ_ChFQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a>.)<br/>Così, unendo queste conoscenze ho avviato un piccolo sogno, quello di <b>poter creare gioielli utilizzando più tecniche</b> e sfruttando più materiali insieme. Ma, <b>ma... mi mancano ancora almeno due esperienze di base: la forgiatura dei metalli e la manipolazione delle resine polimeriche. </b><br/><br/>Per la forgiatura dei metalli ho scelto una artista che fa cose molto belle, lei è Italiana e si Chiama Alessia Spalma e ha un sito che si chiama <a href=""http://beadsandtricks.blogspot.it/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bead and Tricks</a>. <b>Voglio andare a Cormano (vicino Milano), a fare un corso da lei full immersion un giorno intero se non due.</b><br/><br/>Per il Polymer Clay, in Italia non abbiamo artisti di livello. <br/><b>A settembre, a  Praga ci sarà un mega convegno con workshop</b> di <a href=""http://ravensclay.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Melanie West</a> (che trovo superlativa), Melanie Muir e Christine Dumont. Ecco, il mio obiettivo è fare il corso per la lavorazione del metallo a marzo-aprile e quello sul polymer clay a settembre, così da poter realizzare pezzi ancora più belli per il prossimo Natale. <br/><br/>E adesso un po' di biechi conti. <br/><br/>Per poter fare tutto questo, e acquistare alcuni strumenti del mestiere, <b>ho calcolato che mi serviranno almeno 2000 euro.</b> <br/>Ora: <b>la piattaforma  su cui si appoggia questa campagna trattiene per sé UN SACCO di soldi</b>, soprattutto se NON raggiungo l'obiettivo! Assurdo. In una loro pagina dicono che trattengono il 4% per chi raggiunge il goal e il 9% per chi non lo raggiunge, invece a conti fatti (ti dicono la cifra finale appena stabilisci il tuo goal) trattengono il 7% non il 4%!!! <br/>Non si sa quanto prendono a chi non lo raggiunge ma temo non sia meno del 14-15%. <br/>Una bella invenzione 'ste piattaforme di crowdfunding eh? Non fanno niente e guadagnano come un usuraio! viva la tecnologia!<br/> Quindi ho fissato il tetto massimo del mio budget a 2500 euro, così se proprio trovo tante persone a darmi sostegno forse a 2000 euro reali ci posso arrivare. Speriamo anche di più! <br/><b>Ho dovuto fissare una scadenza alla raccolta donazioni,</b> anche questo è un vincolo imposto dalla piattaforma. In ogni caso per Praga devo prenotare già a fine febbraio quindi il prima possibile mi serve sapere se posso andare o no. <b>Se vi viene l'urgenza di donare (anche) dopo</b> la data di scadenza, o <i>brevi manu</i> anziché usare paypal, scrivetemi in privato! :-)<br/><br/><b>Se finanzierete questo mio progetto, ne vedrete i frutti entro Natale 2014.</b> Ovviamente, nel più puro spirito di trasparenza, rendiconterò le mie spese relative a questo progetto tenendo un diario sulla mia pagina HIMBAROSSA su facebook.<br/><br/>L'happy ending. <br/><br/>Se <b>vi va di sostenere la mia crescita e lo sviluppo del progetto Himbarossa</b>, versate direttamente da qui il vostro contributo. Non serve avere un conto paypal, basta una carta di credito o una postepay.

At the same time <b>I started working ebony</b>, a wood I just adore playing with, an soon I created jewels in Sterling Silver, Ebony and other materials, dedicated to my closest friends. <br/><br/>Last September, thanks to a very generous birthday gift <b>I went to Murano</b> (Venice) to attend a full immersion workshop held by Davide Penso on <b>glass beads making</b>. <br/>It was love at first bead. To see how I make them watch this <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZPwrZ_ChFQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a>. <br/>Then I started experimenting, creating jewels made with glass, Silver and also ebony. <br/>And I was extremely happy, my friends told me to take it more seriously and so I did. <br/><br/>Here we are... before going back to Murano to attend the intermediate-advanced course, there are two other materials I want to start working with: copper and polymer clay. <b>This is what this campaign is about: LEARNING!</b><br/><b>I need funds to attend classes and workshops:</b> one in Milan, where Alessia Spalma (see her blog <a href=""http://beadsandtricks.blogspot.it/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Beads and tricks</a>) teaches fold-forming techniques, and the other in Prague, where there will be <a href=""http://ravensclay.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Melanie West</a> (I absolutely love her work!) plus Melanie Muir and Christine Dumont. <br/>The Prague event will be in September 2014 but I need to book at the end of February. <br/><br/><b>I've estimated I'll need approximately 2,000 euros</b> to be able to attend these courses and maybe buy the basic tools I'll need for working. <br/><b>I set my goal at 2,500 since indiegogo will take an heavy commission</b> on my campaign if I succeed, and even heavier if I do not. Nonsense! <br/><br/><b>I hope you will sustain my project</b> <b>supporting me with a donation</b>, If you also want to buy the fruit of this learning process, you are more than welcome and I will be more than <b>happy to apply from 15 to 20% off </b>the prices (for donations over 100 euros, a free creation of my choice for donation of 250 euros or more, a custom made creation - designed by me for the person who donated or someone he/she will give the jewel to - for donations over 500 euros or more). <br/><br/><b>Please feel free to write </b>at himba (at) sbrocca (dot) com for any question, advice, warm encouragement, or if you want to buy and/or trade my jewels. <br/><br/><b>Please spread the word among your friends! </b><br/>And if by any chance you happen to be<b> fluent in another language </b>(Russian, Spanish, Chinese, French, Arabic, etc.) and you are so kind to help me in translating this text for me... I will love you even more! </i><br/><br/><br/><br/>-------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/><b>Himbarossa
 will wachsen!</b><br/><br/>Im November 2013 begann ich ein <b>Projekt namens Himbarossa</b>, was irgendwo 
zwischen Kunst und Handwerk angesiedelt ist. Es steckt allerdings noch 
in den Kinderschuhen!
Eigentlich hat alles vor zwei Jahren begonnen, <b>als ich die Lost-wax 
Technik </b>von meinem Meister Tito Livio Negri, einer der bekanntesten 
Schmuckhersteller von Rom, lernte. <b>Zur gleichen Zeit begann ich mit 
Ebenholz</b>, ein Holz, mit dem ich es Liebe zu spielen, zu arbeiten. Bald 
darauf erstellte ich Schmuckstücke in Sterling Silber, Ebenholz und 
anderen Materialien, welche  ich meinen engsten Freunden gewidmet habe.<br/><br/>Im
 vergangenen September ging ich dank eines sehr großzügigen 
Geburtstagsgeschenks nach Murano (Venedig) für einen Workshop geführt 
von Davide Penso, was mir ein vollständiges Eintauchen  in <b><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZPwrZ_ChFQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">das Glasperlen machen </a></b>ermöglichte.
Es war Liebe auf den ersten Blick.
Daraufhin fing ich an mit der Schaffung von Schmuck aus Glas, Silber und
 auch Ebenholz zu experimentieren. Ich war sehr glücklich. Meine Freunde
 sagten mir, es ernst zu nehmen und so tat ich es.<br/><br/>Hier sind wir 
nun also ... bevor ich wieder nach Murano gehe um den 
intermediate-Aufbaukurs zu besuchen, gibt es zwei weitere Materialien, 
die ich zu meinem Reservoir hinzufügen möchte: Kupfer- und Polymer-Ton. <b>
Und dies ist es um was es in dieser Kampagne geht: LERNEN !
</b>Ich benötige Mittel um an Kursen und Workshops teilzunehmen: einer in 
Mailand, wo Alessia Spalma (siehe ihren blog <a href=""http://beadsandtricks.blogspot.it/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://beadsandtricks.blogspot.it/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Beads und Tricks)</a> <b>
foldforming Techniken</b> lehrt, und der andere in Prag, wo <a href=""http://ravensclay.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Melanie West </a>( 
ich ihre Arbeit lieben ! ) sowie Melanie Muir und Christine Dumont sein 
werden.
<b>Die Veranstaltung in Prag wird erst im September 2014 sein</b>, allerdings 
muss ich bereits Ende Februar buchen.<br/><br/><b>Ich habe geschätzt, dass ich
 mit ca. 2,000 € in der Lage sein müsste,</b> diese Kurse zu besuchen und 
eventuell die grundlegenden Werkzeuge zu kaufen, welche ich für die 
Arbeit brauche.
Allerdings setze ich mein Ziel bei 2.500 € da IndieGoGo eine grosse 
Provision für meine Kampagne abziehen wird, falls es mir gelingen 
sollte. Und sogar noch mehr, wenn ich keinen Erfolg habe. Unsinn!<br/>Ich
 hoffe, dass Sie mein Projekt nachhaltig mit einer Spende unterstützen, 
und natürlich auch die Früchte dieses Lernprozesses zu kaufen. Ich werde
 sehr glücklich sein 15 bis 20 % Rabatt auf die Preise geltend zu machen
 für Spenden über 100 Euro. Für eine Spende von über 250 € werde ich  
ein kostenloses Stück meiner Wahl für Sie erstellen und für Spenden von 
500 € oder mehr eine maßgeschneiderte Kreation speziell für die 
spendende Person gestalten. <br/><br/>Für Fragen bitte zögern Sie nicht <b>

<p>En novembre 2013, j’ai créé <b>Himbarossa, un
projet,</b> encore tout jeune, qui oscille entre l’art et l’artisanat.</p>
<p>En fait, le tout a débuté il y a deux ans
lorsque je me suis familiarisée avec la technique de la cire perdue auprès de
mon mentor Tito Livio Negri, un bijoutier renommé de Rome. C’est à cette époque
que j’ai commencé à travailler l’ébène, un bois avec lequel j’adore créer. Peu
de temps après, <b>je commençais à créer des bijoux</b> en argent sterling et en
ébène, entre autres matériaux, bijoux que j’offrais à mes amis intimes.</p>
<p>En septembre dernier, grâce à un cadeau
d’anniversaire très généreux, j’ai pu aller à Murano, à Venise, afin de
participer à un atelier d’immersion sur <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZPwrZ_ChFQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">la création en perles de verre</a> offert
par Davide Penso.</p>
<p>Ce fut le coup de « perle ».</p>
<p>J’ai alors <b>commencé à expérimenter</b> en
créant des bijoux en verre, en argent et en ébène. J’étais emballée. Mes amis
m’ont suggéré de m’y consacrer sérieusement, ce que j’ai fait.</p>
<p>Voilà. Avant de retourner à Murano pour
suivre le cours de niveau intermédiaire-avancé, i<b>l y a deux autres matériaux
avec lesquels j’aimerais me familiariser</b> : le cuivre et l’argile de
polymère. <b>C’est donc l’objet de cette campagne : APPRENDRE!</b></p>
<p>J’ai besoin de financement pour assister à
des ateliers : l’un est offert à Milan par Alessia Spalma qui enseigne la
technique de fold-forming (je vous réfère à son blog <a href=""http://beadsandtricks.blogspot.it/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Beads and tricks</a>); l’autre est
offert à Prague par <a href=""http://ravensclay.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Melanie West</a> (j’adore
son travail!), Melanie Muir et Christine Dumont. </p>
<p>L’atelier offert à Prague aura lieu en
septembre 2014 mais je dois m’inscrire d’ici la fin février.</p>
<p><b>J’ai évalué à 2 000 € la somme qui me
permettrait d’assister à ces ateliers </b>et me procurer les outils de base. Mon
objectif est de 2 500 € étant donné que indieggo prendra une commission
importante sur ma campagne, si elle réussit, et une commission encore plus
élevée dans le cas contraire. Absurde!</p>
<p>Je vous invite à parrainer mon projet en<b>
me faisant un don.</b> À ceux qui auront fait un don de 100 € et qui voudront
bénéficier des fruits de mon apprentissage, il me fera plaisir de vous offrir
un escompte de 15-20 % sur le prix d’origine. À ceux qui auront fait un don de
250 € et plus, j’offrirai une création de mon choix. Enfin, à ceux qui auront
fait un don de 500 € ou plus, j’offrirai une création originale, que j’aurai
dessinée pour vous ou pour la personne à laquelle vous souhaitez l’offrir.</p>
<p>Je vous invite à m’écrire à <a href=""mailto:himba@sbrocca.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">himba @ sbrocca dot com</a> pour toute question, tout

<br/><br/><br/>______________________________________<br/><br/><br/><b>¡Himbarossa quiere crecer! </b><br/><br/><p>En noviembre de 2013 he
puesto en marcha un proyecto laboral que de momento está en pañales, <b>se llama
HIMBRAROSSA</b>.</p>
<p>Desde hace dos años he
comenzado a usar la <span>técnica
tradicional de <b>la cera perdida</b> para
hacer joyas de plata y bronce, al mismo tiempo <b>he comenzado a trabajar el ébano</b>,
he creado piezas en plata-ébano y bronce-ébano. Todo
esto graciasal apoyo deun maestroorfebre que se llama Tito Livio Negri.</span></p>
<p>En septiembre de 2013
estuve en Murano estudiando los fundamentos de la <span>técnica
artesanal para    </span>hacer<b> cuentas de vidrio,</b> con el maestro Davide Penso (¡gracias a un generoso
regalo de cumpleaños!). E<span>n este <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZPwrZ_ChFQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a> les muestro cómo hago una perla</span>.<br/></p><p>De este modo, uniendo todos estos conocimientos he
desarrollado un pequeño sueño, el de poder crear joyas utilizando muchas
técnicas y mezclando más materiales. Aunque… <b>me faltan</b> aún al menos <b>dos
técnicas básicas</b>: la forja de metales y el trabajo de la resina polimérica.<span></span></p>
<p>Para la forja de metales
he elegido una artista que crea piezas muy bonitas, es italiana y se llama
<a href=""http://beadsandtricks.blogspot.it/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alessia Spalma</a>, tiene un página web <span><span><span>Bead and Tricks</span></span>. Quiero ir a Cormano (cerca de Milán), para hacer un
curso intensivo de un día o dos.</span></p>
<p>Por otro lado, para
aprender la técnica de la resina polimérica, en Italia no hay artistas de
nivel. En septiembre, habrá una conferencia-taller en Praga de <a href=""http://ravensclay.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Melanie West </a><span>(desde mi punto de vista es magnífica), Melanie Muir e
Christine Dumont. </span></p>
<p>Bueno, <b>mi objetivo es
hacer el curso sobre el trabajo del metal en marzo-abril y el de resina
polimérica en septiembre</b>, de este modo
podría hacer piezas hermosas para la próxima Navidad.</p>
<p>Para poder hacer todo
esto, y comprar algunas herramientas del oficio, he calculado que<span>  <b>necesitare al menos unos 2000 euros</b>.</span></p>
<p>La plataforma sobre la
que se apoya esta campaña necesita mucho dinero, ¡sobre todo si NO consigo el
objetivo!, ridículo. <span>En su página dicen
que retienen el 4% de lo obtenido a aquellos que consiguen su
objetivo, y el 9% para los que no
lo alcanza, aunque (te diré que la
cifra final solo se establece una vez alcanzada la meta) ¡¡reteniendo el 7% y no el 4%!!</span></p>
<p><span>No se
sabe lo que</span> <span>retienen
a los que no llegan, pero me temo
que no es menos del 14-15%.
Un buen invento estas plataformas de
crowdfunding ¿eh?, ¡No hacen nada
y ganan como
un usurero!, ¡viva la tecnología!</span></p>
<p>Visto lo visto el techo
máximo de mi presupuesto lo he puesto en 2500 euros, así si encuentro mucha
gente que me apoye, entonces podría conseguir 2000 euros reales. ¡Ojala pueda

<br/><p></p></div>","(English, German, French, Spanish and Portuguese text below) Nel novembre 2013 ho dato vita a un progetto di lavoro che per ora è ancora cucciolo, si chiama HIMBAROSSA.Due anni fa ho cominciato a usare la tecnica della cera-persa per realizzare gioielli in argento e bronzo, contemporaneamente ho iniziato a lavorare l'ebano e ho creato alcuni gioielli in argento ed ebano o bronzo ed ebano. Il tutto anche grazie al sostegno di un maestro orafo che si chiama Tito Livio Negri. A settembre del 2013 sono andata a Murano a studiare le basi della tecnica di lavoro del vetro al lume, col maestro Davide Penso, possibilità che mi è stata data grazie ad un munifico regalo di compleanno. (Per capire di che si tratta quardate questo mio video.)Così, unendo queste conoscenze ho avviato un piccolo sogno, quello di poter creare gioielli utilizzando più tecniche e sfruttando più materiali insieme. Ma, ma... mi mancano ancora almeno due esperienze di base: la forgiatura dei metalli e la manipolazione delle resine polimeriche. Per la forgiatura dei metalli ho scelto una artista che fa cose molto belle, lei è Italiana e si Chiama Alessia Spalma e ha un sito che si chiama Bead and Tricks. Voglio andare a Cormano (vicino Milano), a fare un corso da lei full immersion un giorno intero se non due.Per il Polymer Clay, in Italia non abbiamo artisti di livello. A settembre, a  Praga ci sarà un mega convegno con workshop di Melanie West (che trovo superlativa), Melanie Muir e Christine Dumont. Ecco, il mio obiettivo è fare il corso per la lavorazione del metallo a marzo-aprile e quello sul polymer clay a settembre, così da poter realizzare pezzi ancora più belli per il prossimo Natale. E adesso un po' di biechi conti. Per poter fare tutto questo, e acquistare alcuni strumenti del mestiere, ho calcolato che mi serviranno almeno 2000 euro. Ora: la piattaforma  su cui si appoggia questa campagna trattiene per sé UN SACCO di soldi, soprattutto se NON raggiungo l'obiettivo! Assurdo. In una loro pagina dicono che trattengono il 4% per chi raggiunge il goal e il 9% per chi non lo raggiunge, invece a conti fatti (ti dicono la cifra finale appena stabilisci il tuo goal) trattengono il 7% non il 4%!!! Non si sa quanto prendono a chi non lo raggiunge ma temo non sia meno del 14-15%. Una bella invenzione 'ste piattaforme di crowdfunding eh? Non fanno niente e guadagnano come un usuraio! viva la tecnologia! Quindi ho fissato il tetto massimo del mio budget a 2500 euro, così se proprio trovo tante persone a darmi sostegno forse a 2000 euro reali ci posso arrivare. Speriamo anche di più! Ho dovuto fissare una scadenza alla raccolta donazioni, anche questo è un vincolo imposto dalla piattaforma. In ogni caso per Praga devo prenotare già a fine febbraio quindi il prima possibile mi serve sapere se posso andare o no. Se vi viene l'urgenza di donare (anche) dopo la data di scadenza, o brevi manu anziché usare paypal, scrivetemi in privato! :-)Se finanzierete questo mio progetto, ne vedrete i frutti entro Natale 2014. Ovviamente, nel più puro spirito di trasparenza, rendiconterò le mie spese relative a questo progetto tenendo un diario sulla mia pagina HIMBAROSSA su facebook.L'happy ending. Se vi va di sostenere la mia crescita e lo sviluppo del progetto Himbarossa, versate direttamente da qui il vostro contributo. Non serve avere un conto paypal, basta una carta di credito o una postepay. Grazie! Se avete suggerimenti, domande, curiosità, parole di incoraggiamento, proposte di collaborazione et similia, scrivetemi a himba chiocciola sbrocca punto com. IMPORTANTISSIMO: passate parola! Inoltre, se conoscete le basi di un'altra lingua (Francese, Spagnolo, Arabo, Chinese, Russo, ecc.) e vi va di aiutarmi a tradurre questo testo per poter diffondere la campagna in giro per il mondo vi vorrò ancora più bene!Per vedere il video di presentazione di questa campagna e vedere chi sonocliccate qui https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzQts9Jd3X4. --------------------------------------------------------------Himbarossa wants to improve!In November 2013 I started my own project called Himbarossa, it's something in between art and crafts and it's still almost a newborn. Actually it all began two years ago, when I started learnig the lost-wax technique from my Master Tito Livio Negri, a well-known jewel maker of Rome. At the same time I started working ebony, a wood I just adore playing with, an soon I created jewels in Sterling Silver, Ebony and other materials, dedicated to my closest friends. Last September, thanks to a very generous birthday gift I went to Murano (Venice) to attend a full immersion workshop held by Davide Penso on glass beads making. It was love at first bead. To see how I make them watch this video. Then I started experimenting, creating jewels made with glass, Silver and also ebony. And I was extremely happy, my friends told me to take it more seriously and so I did. Here we are... before going back to Murano to attend the intermediate-advanced course, there are two other materials I want to start working with: copper and polymer clay. This is what this campaign is about: LEARNING!I need funds to attend classes and workshops: one in Milan, where Alessia Spalma (see her blog Beads and tricks) teaches fold-forming techniques, and the other in Prague, where there will be Melanie West (I absolutely love her work!) plus Melanie Muir and Christine Dumont. The Prague event will be in September 2014 but I need to book at the end of February. I've estimated I'll need approximately 2,000 euros to be able to attend these courses and maybe buy the basic tools I'll need for working. I set my goal at 2,500 since indiegogo will take an heavy commission on my campaign if I succeed, and even heavier if I do not. Nonsense! I hope you will sustain my project supporting me with a donation, If you also want to buy the fruit of this learning process, you are more than welcome and I will be more than happy to apply from 15 to 20% off the prices (for donations over 100 euros, a free creation of my choice for donation of 250 euros or more, a custom made creation - designed by me for the person who donated or someone he/she will give the jewel to - for donations over 500 euros or more). Please feel free to write at himba (at) sbrocca (dot) com for any question, advice, warm encouragement, or if you want to buy and/or trade my jewels. Please spread the word among your friends! And if by any chance you happen to be fluent in another language (Russian, Spanish, Chinese, French, Arabic, etc.) and you are so kind to help me in translating this text for me... I will love you even more! -------------------------------------------------------------Himbarossa
 will wachsen!Im November 2013 begann ich ein Projekt namens Himbarossa, was irgendwo 
zwischen Kunst und Handwerk angesiedelt ist. Es steckt allerdings noch 
in den Kinderschuhen!
Eigentlich hat alles vor zwei Jahren begonnen, als ich die Lost-wax 
Technik von meinem Meister Tito Livio Negri, einer der bekanntesten 
Schmuckhersteller von Rom, lernte. Zur gleichen Zeit begann ich mit 
Ebenholz, ein Holz, mit dem ich es Liebe zu spielen, zu arbeiten. Bald 
darauf erstellte ich Schmuckstücke in Sterling Silber, Ebenholz und 
anderen Materialien, welche  ich meinen engsten Freunden gewidmet habe.Im
 vergangenen September ging ich dank eines sehr großzügigen 
Geburtstagsgeschenks nach Murano (Venedig) für einen Workshop geführt 
von Davide Penso, was mir ein vollständiges Eintauchen  in das Glasperlen machen ermöglichte.
Es war Liebe auf den ersten Blick.
Daraufhin fing ich an mit der Schaffung von Schmuck aus Glas, Silber und
 auch Ebenholz zu experimentieren. Ich war sehr glücklich. Meine Freunde
 sagten mir, es ernst zu nehmen und so tat ich es.Hier sind wir 
nun also ... bevor ich wieder nach Murano gehe um den 
intermediate-Aufbaukurs zu besuchen, gibt es zwei weitere Materialien, 
die ich zu meinem Reservoir hinzufügen möchte: Kupfer- und Polymer-Ton. 
Und dies ist es um was es in dieser Kampagne geht: LERNEN !
Ich benötige Mittel um an Kursen und Workshops teilzunehmen: einer in 
Mailand, wo Alessia Spalma (siehe ihren blog Beads und Tricks) 
foldforming Techniken lehrt, und der andere in Prag, wo Melanie West ( 
ich ihre Arbeit lieben ! ) sowie Melanie Muir und Christine Dumont sein 
werden.
Die Veranstaltung in Prag wird erst im September 2014 sein, allerdings 
muss ich bereits Ende Februar buchen.Ich habe geschätzt, dass ich
 mit ca. 2,000 € in der Lage sein müsste, diese Kurse zu besuchen und 
eventuell die grundlegenden Werkzeuge zu kaufen, welche ich für die 
Arbeit brauche.
Allerdings setze ich mein Ziel bei 2.500 € da IndieGoGo eine grosse 
Provision für meine Kampagne abziehen wird, falls es mir gelingen 
sollte. Und sogar noch mehr, wenn ich keinen Erfolg habe. Unsinn!Ich
 hoffe, dass Sie mein Projekt nachhaltig mit einer Spende unterstützen, 
und natürlich auch die Früchte dieses Lernprozesses zu kaufen. Ich werde
 sehr glücklich sein 15 bis 20 % Rabatt auf die Preise geltend zu machen
 für Spenden über 100 Euro. Für eine Spende von über 250 € werde ich  
ein kostenloses Stück meiner Wahl für Sie erstellen und für Spenden von 
500 € oder mehr eine maßgeschneiderte Kreation speziell für die 
spendende Person gestalten. Für Fragen bitte zögern Sie nicht 
himba at sbrocca dot com zu schreiben um Beratung,  Ermutigung zum 
Spenden, oder Informationen zum kauf und / oder tausch meine Juwelen 
erhalten möchten.Bitte verbreiten Sie dies auch unter Ihren 
Freunden !
Und wenn Sie durch Zufall Sie fließend in einer anderen Sprache ( 
Russisch, Chinesisch, Arabisch, etc.) sind, bin 
ich im Vorraus schon sehr dankbar für die Übersetzung dieses Textes ... 
Ich werde dich noch mehr lieben !-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Himbarossa veut prendre son envol!
En novembre 2013, j’ai créé Himbarossa, un
projet, encore tout jeune, qui oscille entre l’art et l’artisanat.
En fait, le tout a débuté il y a deux ans
lorsque je me suis familiarisée avec la technique de la cire perdue auprès de
mon mentor Tito Livio Negri, un bijoutier renommé de Rome. C’est à cette époque
que j’ai commencé à travailler l’ébène, un bois avec lequel j’adore créer. Peu
de temps après, je commençais à créer des bijoux en argent sterling et en
ébène, entre autres matériaux, bijoux que j’offrais à mes amis intimes.
En septembre dernier, grâce à un cadeau
d’anniversaire très généreux, j’ai pu aller à Murano, à Venise, afin de
participer à un atelier d’immersion sur la création en perles de verre offert
par Davide Penso.
Ce fut le coup de « perle ».
J’ai alors commencé à expérimenter en
créant des bijoux en verre, en argent et en ébène. J’étais emballée. Mes amis
m’ont suggéré de m’y consacrer sérieusement, ce que j’ai fait.
Voilà. Avant de retourner à Murano pour
suivre le cours de niveau intermédiaire-avancé, il y a deux autres matériaux
avec lesquels j’aimerais me familiariser : le cuivre et l’argile de
polymère. C’est donc l’objet de cette campagne : APPRENDRE!
J’ai besoin de financement pour assister à
des ateliers : l’un est offert à Milan par Alessia Spalma qui enseigne la
technique de fold-forming (je vous réfère à son blog Beads and tricks); l’autre est
offert à Prague par Melanie West (j’adore
son travail!), Melanie Muir et Christine Dumont. 
L’atelier offert à Prague aura lieu en
septembre 2014 mais je dois m’inscrire d’ici la fin février.
J’ai évalué à 2 000 € la somme qui me
permettrait d’assister à ces ateliers et me procurer les outils de base. Mon
objectif est de 2 500 € étant donné que indieggo prendra une commission
importante sur ma campagne, si elle réussit, et une commission encore plus
élevée dans le cas contraire. Absurde!
Je vous invite à parrainer mon projet en
me faisant un don. À ceux qui auront fait un don de 100 € et qui voudront
bénéficier des fruits de mon apprentissage, il me fera plaisir de vous offrir
un escompte de 15-20 % sur le prix d’origine. À ceux qui auront fait un don de
250 € et plus, j’offrirai une création de mon choix. Enfin, à ceux qui auront
fait un don de 500 € ou plus, j’offrirai une création originale, que j’aurai
dessinée pour vous ou pour la personne à laquelle vous souhaitez l’offrir.
Je vous invite à m’écrire à himba @ sbrocca dot com pour toute question, tout
commentaire, pour m’encourager ou encore si vous souhaitez acheter ou vendre
mes créations.
Passez le mot à vos amis!

Si
vous parlez couramment une autre langue (le russe, le chinois, l’arabe, etc.) et que vous pouvez m’aider à traduire ce texte, je
vous aimerai encore davantage!
______________________________________¡Himbarossa quiere crecer! En noviembre de 2013 he
puesto en marcha un proyecto laboral que de momento está en pañales, se llama
HIMBRAROSSA.
Desde hace dos años he
comenzado a usar la técnica
tradicional de la cera perdida para
hacer joyas de plata y bronce, al mismo tiempo he comenzado a trabajar el ébano,
he creado piezas en plata-ébano y bronce-ébano. Todo
esto graciasal apoyo deun maestroorfebre que se llama Tito Livio Negri.
En septiembre de 2013
estuve en Murano estudiando los fundamentos de la técnica
artesanal para    hacer cuentas de vidrio, con el maestro Davide Penso (¡gracias a un generoso
regalo de cumpleaños!). En este video les muestro cómo hago una perla.De este modo, uniendo todos estos conocimientos he
desarrollado un pequeño sueño, el de poder crear joyas utilizando muchas
técnicas y mezclando más materiales. Aunque… me faltan aún al menos dos
técnicas básicas: la forja de metales y el trabajo de la resina polimérica.
Para la forja de metales
he elegido una artista que crea piezas muy bonitas, es italiana y se llama
Alessia Spalma, tiene un página web Bead and Tricks. Quiero ir a Cormano (cerca de Milán), para hacer un
curso intensivo de un día o dos.
Por otro lado, para
aprender la técnica de la resina polimérica, en Italia no hay artistas de
nivel. En septiembre, habrá una conferencia-taller en Praga de Melanie West (desde mi punto de vista es magnífica), Melanie Muir e
Christine Dumont. 
Bueno, mi objetivo es
hacer el curso sobre el trabajo del metal en marzo-abril y el de resina
polimérica en septiembre, de este modo
podría hacer piezas hermosas para la próxima Navidad.
Para poder hacer todo
esto, y comprar algunas herramientas del oficio, he calculado que  necesitare al menos unos 2000 euros.
La plataforma sobre la
que se apoya esta campaña necesita mucho dinero, ¡sobre todo si NO consigo el
objetivo!, ridículo. En su página dicen
que retienen el 4% de lo obtenido a aquellos que consiguen su
objetivo, y el 9% para los que no
lo alcanza, aunque (te diré que la
cifra final solo se establece una vez alcanzada la meta) ¡¡reteniendo el 7% y no el 4%!!
No se
sabe lo que retienen
a los que no llegan, pero me temo
que no es menos del 14-15%.
Un buen invento estas plataformas de
crowdfunding ¿eh?, ¡No hacen nada
y ganan como
un usurero!, ¡viva la tecnología!
Visto lo visto el techo
máximo de mi presupuesto lo he puesto en 2500 euros, así si encuentro mucha
gente que me apoye, entonces podría conseguir 2000 euros reales. ¡Ojala pueda
conseguir más! 
Me había fijado un plazo
para recoger las aportaciones, esto también es una restricción impuesta por la
plataforma. De todos modos debería hacer la reserva para Praga a finales de
febrero, por eso necesito saber lo antes posible si puedo ir o no. Si se quiere
donar después del plazo de vencimiento, se puede usar PayPal, ¡por favor envíame
un correo electrónico privado! :-)
Si ayudas a financiar mi
proyecto, verás los resultados antes de la Navidad de 2014. Obviamente, con
toda la transparencia posible, daré cuenta de los gastos relacionados con este
proyecto con un diario en mi página de Facebook HIMBAROSSA.
¡Espero llegar a buen
puerto con todo esto!
Si quieres ayudar a mi
formación y al desarrollo del proyecto Himbarossa, puedes hacer tu aportación
directamente desde aquí. No es necesaria una cuenta PayPal, sólo una tarjeta de
crédito.
Si tienes sugerencias,
preguntas, curiosidades, palabras de ánimo, propuestas de colaboración o
similares, por favor envíame un email a himba at sbrocca .com.
IMPORTANTISIMO: ¡¡correr
la voz!!
Si conoces otras lenguas
(árabe, chino, ruso, etc.), y  me quieres
ayudar puedes traducir este texto, para de este modo contribuir a la buena difusión de la campaña por el mundo.  ¡Gracias!

what I’ve been doing and how you can help.</p>
<p>Last year I had the opportunity to visit a friend teaching a
school for Karen refuges on the Thai/Burma boarder and ended up teaching for a
month. Burma has been undergoing one of the longest civil wars in history.
Including some of the most atrocious human rights violations the world has
seen. This war is being fought between the Burmese majority and the ethnic
minorities of Burma, Karen being the largest of the minority groups. </p>
<p>Since meeting Karen people my life has been changed so much.
Each day I am amazed by the beauty and the gentleness of their souls, something
that is quite rare from anyone - let alone people who have endured so much. My
heart was hungry to  know these people, I
knew I had to come back, teach, live with and be taught by the Karen.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/248547/files/20131207230703-20131020_102534.jpg?1386486423"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p> I left America on
October 7<sup>th</sup> and after multiple flights, trains, and buses I arrived
at Thoo Mwe Khee School just outside of Phop Phra, Thailand on October 9<sup>th</sup>.
</p>
<p>Thoo Mwe Khee is a migrant school for Karen minorities of
Burma and is about a mile from the border of Burma. There are about 300
students that live on-site and about 600 altogether. My reason for being in
this fantastic place is to teach. I am a teacher of about 100 students. My
background is the health care field so I teach Health Science, something that I
am very excited to be teaching. The government of Burma spends less than 3% on
health care and almost nothing on educating. Some of the students had never
seen a diagram of the human body or know nothing about hygiene and sanitation.
Despite this, many of my students want to be nurses and doctors. Having been
raised in a war zone this is understandable, as many of them having seen
atrocities we cannot even fathom.  Being
able to educate them about common diseases, first aid, and basic health care is
an invaluable blessing and a great necessity. 
</p>
<p>In addition to health I also teach social studies -
something that I’m also very passionate about. Many of them are from villages
without any connection to the world outside. Being at Thoo Mwe Khee is the
first time many of them have seen computers, guitars, and white people. So
teaching them Social studies is and honor and a treat. </p><p>My days are spent teaching, lesson planning and
fellowshipping with my students. I have little time for much else, but I will
keep you all posted more in the future. </p>
<p>What you can do to help?</p>
<p>Thoo Mwe Khee is very poor, so I don’t get paid for
teaching. Only two meals are provided a day usually consisting of rice and fish
paste (fermented fish guts) so I sometimes buy snacks or meals out and eggs. I
also have to pay for all of my teaching material, including countless copies
from the local print shop, medical supplies for teaching, as well as medical
supplies for the students (I’ve become a little bit of a school nurse) and other
random expenses, like driving students to the clinic which is 45 minutes away. </p>
<p>I would be most grateful if you would give to me
financially, I’m looking to raise about $1,500, which will cover all my living,
teaching, and medical supplies expenses as well as a plane ticket home. If you
would like to pray for me and send me encouragement that is also much needed.
But I encourage each of you to research the Karen people more, as many cities
have a Karen community. So If you have the opportunity, go and meet them. I
promise you will be changed too. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/267336/files/20131218044831-1479006_10152470266889745_2085921934_n.jpg?1387370911"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p><br/><p><br/></p><p></p></div>","Hello friends and family, I would like to let you know about

supplies for the students (I’ve become a little bit of a school nurse) and other
random expenses, like driving students to the clinic which is 45 minutes away. 
I would be most grateful if you would give to me
financially, I’m looking to raise about $1,500, which will cover all my living,
teaching, and medical supplies expenses as well as a plane ticket home. If you
would like to pray for me and send me encouragement that is also much needed.
But I encourage each of you to research the Karen people more, as many cities
have a Karen community. So If you have the opportunity, go and meet them. I
promise you will be changed too.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Your support is crucial to the outcome of the symposium. By helping us reach our goal, we will be able to develop a strong foundation and core curriculum for offering collective insight training.  With additional funding, we can build a website that will host a collaborative college.</p>
<p>Because it is important to have a larger community be a part of this special event, we have designed the symposium so you can participate in many different ways. With a $ 40 donation you can join our social media site where you will receive real-time blog posts of what is happening ""on the ground"" so to speak, and participate with people like yourself who are enthusiastic and curious about collective insight. These will include photographs and short videos. You will meet and interact with others who, like you, are interested in building these emergent capacities.</p>
<p><br/>At the $60 level you will receive private links to raw video footage of the symposium, which will include direct addresses and candid interviews. Up this to $80 and you will receive an Alderlore Insight Center T-shirt that will support our further work.</p>
<p><br/>On Friday night and on Saturday night from 7-8:30 pm(Eastern), we will be live broadcasting two special events. Designed as a panel-on-panel ""rapid fire"" exchange, on all things arising -- these spontaneous discussions are sure to be extraordinarily fertile sessions. To participate, and add <i>your voice to the fire</i>, select Friday Night Lights or Saturday Night Fever (or both). </p>
<p><br/>Those of you who will not be around to participate in real time, can opt to receive a dropbox of all the blog, video and livestream material in a post-production package by supporting us at the $ 200 level. Add an Alderlore T-Shirt, and you won't miss a beat.</p>
<p><br/>For those who are interested in doing <i>more</i>, and be a part of the ongoing practice that emerges, there are three options. At the $ 400 level you can get started with a short training session which includes training material. At the $1200 level we offer customized coaching for facilitating collective insight. If you represent a team or group who could benefit from collective insight training, we offer a one-day on-site workshop given by Alderlore Insight Center faculty -- this for $ 3000 (travel and expenses not included). Your support at the $ 6000 level reserves the retreat studio at Alderlore Insight Center for you and up to 5 other people for a 4-day intensive that will immerse you in collective insight practice.</p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/73548/files/20130914042158-Script01.png?1379157718"" src="""" style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em; width: 400.18181818181813px; height: 93px;""/><br/></p>
<p>Collective Insight is the experience of a group of people working together all having the same key insight at the same time. Although one or two individuals might speak it first, each person experiences the insight, the “ah ha” moment, spontaneously and at the same time, so there is very little impression that one or another individual came up with the idea. On the contrary, people report the feeling of already knowing what the person was going to say, or alternately, the feeling of having someone “take the words right out of my mouth.”</p>
<p>Collective Insight can be compared to a group of musicians from different bands and different styles coming together to play. At first they are each playing in their own sound, so it just sounds like an arbitrary mixture of competing riffs. As they search for a sound that is completely new, the result goes through phases of dissonance and experiment. Without any previous idea of what the result will be, and without needing anything like agreement or consensus on this form or that, the group can spontaneously settle into a completely new sound – something that surprises even them. Together, they begin to “hear” the form that is shaping, that is moving them toward an emergent new way of playing that has never been played before.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/73533/files/20130914041243-Script02.png?1379157163"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We already know quite a few things about collective insight. We know it is a special and rare outcome of group interaction.  We know that collective Insight is emergent, embodied, creative, spontaneous, imaginative, playful and powerful. Although most people have difficulty describing it, every person knows it when they experience it. In fact, outside observers who come in after the fact can tell when a group has achieved collective insights. We know that collective insight is powerful because it taps into creativity that is greater than the sum total of the individuals in the group. We know that it depends upon people in the group having a sufficient orientation toward letting go of their individual patterns of behavior, thinking, doing, and saying, while also being willing to abandon what they know in lieu of what they might be surprised to learn, and able to allow themselves to flow with emotional, dialogic, conceptual and relational movements through all kinds of phases and in any and all directions.<br/><br/>We know that collective insight requires the ability to stick with the engagement during the oftentimes long process of working through the uncomfortable periods when nothing seems to be happening, or everything seems to be going wrong. We know that these are periods which are very similar to natural adaptive processes, in which many configurations of outcomes are tried, but few achieve the right “fit” or resonance. In these periods, a bright idea might fizzle out while deep silence or dark tension might spark a wave of inspiration. We know that the process depends strongly on relational dynamics, and that relational dynamics are non-linear and ride strong waves of emotional energy and subtle energetics. Finally, we know that it is impossible to determine what is a “beneficial” contribution and what is not, since everything that happens contributes to the adaptive process, which can benefit from contributions that can feel pleasant or unpleasant, and that therefore, the greatest potential for collective insights happens in groups where people learn to be equanimous with the process and happy to participate without expectation of outcome.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/73553/files/20130914042335-Script03.png?1379157815"" src="""" style=""width: 403.23664122137404px; height: 93px;""/></p>
<p>For a little more than 20 years small groups of people around the world have been experimenting with different versions of collective engagement. The earliest attempts at group alignment, such as world café, focus on forms of outward communication and forms of presentation. With the introduction of Otto Scharma’s U-theory the focus turned toward quality of the internal state or presence of the individuals participating in group activities. Ria Baeck has carried this into the practice of collective presencing. Bill Torbert introduced the system of action-logics and its role in leadership, while Terri O’Fallon’s GTC program focuses on the role of higher stages and states of awareness in facilitating transformative change. More recently  Terry Patten coined the term “trans-rhetorical” and others have used the term “generative discourse” to signify a new type of discourse that leads to or arises within groups that practice  what Dustin DiPerna has called transpersonal “inter-being.”  Still, other practices rely on transpersonal states of spiritual arousal that open and deepen awareness toward a kind of trans-individual being, as reported by a core group of practitioners of Enlighten Next.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/73558/files/20130914043310-Script04.png?1379158390"" src="""" style=""width: 198.83870967741933px; height: 92px;""/></p>
<p>Almost all the practices we mentioned have taken place within groups that self-select based on community needs, shared values, or spiritual commitments. We can consider these practices as community-specific. Community-specific practices are in some sense “primed” by specialized language, shared memes, formal and sometimes rigorous rules of engagement – whether explicitly stated or operating implicitly. While these conditions maintain group cohesion, they can also intensify peer pressure and create false consciousness.</p>
<p>Despite this, and because of this, all the people participating in this symposium have been very careful to delineate specific approaches that steer clear of the conventional traps of collective practice. This symposium brings these traditions together for the first time to engage as peers – all on the same level, all in the same “soup” as it were – to practice collective insight. The practice we will perform will not be pre-stated, but must arise from the co-creative and emergent “fermentation process”, to use a tour from Bruno Latour – the form of the practice must arise from a kind of fermentation of what we bring, individually and collectively, to the engagement. We will be open to being surprised, and welcome what comes next.<br/><br/>This is both a challenging and exciting prospect. What will we find out about ourselves? What will we witness about the process of engaging as peers? What principles of collective practice will we discover? What significant insights will come, in the spontaneous co-creative relational dynamics that will course through our 4 days together.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/83848/files/20130919082135-Important.png?1379604095"" src="""" style=""width: 294.14285714285717px; height: 87px;""/></p>
<p>If we can derive principles  for generating collective insight in groups where there are few selection criteria, and where people represent a broad range of values and oftentimes “competing” worldviews – then we have a powerful practice for addressing 21 Century problems. How often our communities, our businesses, our organizations, our governments, stymied by dysfunctional means of discourse and pathological ways of being together. Relational dynamics are more often destructive than generative in groups, especially where the topics are complex and the stakes are very high.</p>
<p>If we can set out a rigorous set of principles for collective insight, that is not values or world-view specific, but is methodological in scope and processural in practice, then we have the possibility of bringing collective insight-training into a much larger context. </p>

While these conditions maintain group cohesion, they can also intensify peer pressure and create false consciousness.
Despite this, and because of this, all the people participating in this symposium have been very careful to delineate specific approaches that steer clear of the conventional traps of collective practice. This symposium brings these traditions together for the first time to engage as peers – all on the same level, all in the same “soup” as it were – to practice collective insight. The practice we will perform will not be pre-stated, but must arise from the co-creative and emergent “fermentation process”, to use a tour from Bruno Latour – the form of the practice must arise from a kind of fermentation of what we bring, individually and collectively, to the engagement. We will be open to being surprised, and welcome what comes next.This is both a challenging and exciting prospect. What will we find out about ourselves? What will we witness about the process of engaging as peers? What principles of collective practice will we discover? What significant insights will come, in the spontaneous co-creative relational dynamics that will course through our 4 days together.

If we can derive principles  for generating collective insight in groups where there are few selection criteria, and where people represent a broad range of values and oftentimes “competing” worldviews – then we have a powerful practice for addressing 21 Century problems. How often our communities, our businesses, our organizations, our governments, stymied by dysfunctional means of discourse and pathological ways of being together. Relational dynamics are more often destructive than generative in groups, especially where the topics are complex and the stakes are very high.
If we can set out a rigorous set of principles for collective insight, that is not values or world-view specific, but is methodological in scope and processural in practice, then we have the possibility of bringing collective insight-training into a much larger context.

<p>The ability to read, understand, write, and to do basic calculations is taken for granted by many of us. If we didn’t have those skills, imagine how life would be. Imagine how difficult it would be in 2013 to do many of the daily activities we consider commonplace. Activities such as reading signs, following directions, budgeting, and planning.</p>
<p>In 2011 there were an estimated 39 million Americans who didn’t have a high school diploma. Some have very high literacy and computational skills; many others do not.</p>
<p>At the Julia West House, a registered nonprofit organization, we offer free tutoring in literacy and GED® Test preparation to students at every level of competency and ability. Some need just a few weeks to achieve high test scores while others dedicate many months to study and preparation before taking the tests. Some never complete the tests, but gain enough new skills that they can function much more intelligently and effectively.</p>
<p>All of our tutors are volunteers. Some tutor one adult learner, once a week. Others tutor multiple students once or multiple times each week. Tutoring sessions are all one-on-one, lasting an hour, an hour and a half, or two hours each.</p>
<p><strong>Who</strong></p>
<p>Our adult learners look to Julia West House for opportunities, support, and encouragement. The Julia West House has been an outreach for Portland, Oregon residents for over 20 years. Our mission, to serve low-income and homeless residents, has not changed. Our outreach and services have changed as we have adjusted to meet the changing needs of the community and those we serve. In 2005 we began GED® Test preparation and literacy tutoring. We are now focused on programs that help people break cycles of harmful habits and behavior, find purpose, and find work.</p>
<p><strong>Why</strong></p>
<p>The GED® Test program is changing in profound ways. Instead of paper and books, the program will be entirely on-line. The focus is on a test-taker’s lifecycle—from a better study experience to a smooth transition into a job or postsecondary education. Today, adult learners compete in a new economic and global market. More jobs call for skilled, educated labor, requiring additional training and education beyond a high school diploma.</p>
<p><strong>What</strong></p>
<p>GED® traing and testing is moving from printed course material (books, worksheets, and tests) to a 100% computer-based and highly interactive instructional model. The program focuses on core competencies and preparing test takers for the next step in their education.</p>
<p>In order for our adult learners to continue their development, we need to obtain the computers, software, support, and supplies that allow us to use the new GED training and testing program for study and training. The items we need and the cost are:</p>
<ul>
<li>$2,500 - 5 laptop computers for student study stations</li>
<li>$600 - 1 laptop computer for the GED/Literacy coordinator</li>
<li>$300 - 1 laser printer</li>
<li>$8,250 - 5 GED® software licenses (3 years @$2,750/year)</li>
<li>$500 - Technical support for set up</li>
<li>$250 - Supplies</li>
<li>$1,000 - 5 carrels for study stations</li>
</ul><p>Total =  <strong>$13,250</strong></p>
<p>If we don’t receive full funding at this time, we will buy GED® software licenses for a single year for $2,750, or for two years for $5,500.</p>
<p>This will provide us the equipment and resources to schedule 100 tutoring sessions each week.</p>
<p><strong>When</strong></p>
<p>Beginning in January, 2014, GED® Testing Services is changing to create a new test delivery and assessment system that will fundamentally improve adult education. We need to acquire and install hardware, software, and study stations by November, 2013, to be able to train our volunteers, and to be ready to cutover to the new GED Test system on January 2, 2014.</p>

The ability to read, understand, write, and to do basic calculations is taken for granted by many of us. If we didn’t have those skills, imagine how life would be. Imagine how difficult it would be in 2013 to do many of the daily activities we consider commonplace. Activities such as reading signs, following directions, budgeting, and planning.
In 2011 there were an estimated 39 million Americans who didn’t have a high school diploma. Some have very high literacy and computational skills; many others do not.
At the Julia West House, a registered nonprofit organization, we offer free tutoring in literacy and GED® Test preparation to students at every level of competency and ability. Some need just a few weeks to achieve high test scores while others dedicate many months to study and preparation before taking the tests. Some never complete the tests, but gain enough new skills that they can function much more intelligently and effectively.
All of our tutors are volunteers. Some tutor one adult learner, once a week. Others tutor multiple students once or multiple times each week. Tutoring sessions are all one-on-one, lasting an hour, an hour and a half, or two hours each.

</h3><p>We are journalists and free speech activists. We have
campaigned on behalf of journalists around the world because we believe everyone
should be free to share information and ideas. We don't want politicians
telling journalists what to write: we just need news we can trust.</p>
<p>We are setting up an independent self-regulator for the press
as recommended by Lord Justice Leveson after his year-long inquiry. We want
journalists to be able to defend themselves against libel bullies. And we want
ordinary people to be able to challenge and correct journalists when they get
things wrong or their stories cause real harm. The big newspaper groups are
refusing to meet the public's wish for independent self-regulation, so it's up
to us to solve this problem, once and for all.</p>
<p>We have worked with amazing journalists who have exposed
abuse and corruption around the world. Some of them have paid for their courage
with their lives. Others work under the constant fear of imprisonment and
torture. We are lucky in the UK that our press is free to hold the powerful to
account. Independent self-regulation can only strengthen this freedom, by rebuilding
the public's trust in journalism and giving journalists the confidence to tell
the stories that matter, without fear or favour.</p>
<p>The IMPRESS Project has already received a grant for £5,000
from the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust. We need to match this with £5,375 in
public donations to pay for a series of meetings and events in spring 2014. We
have budgeted for staffing costs of £7,000; communications costs of £500;
printing &amp; postage costs of £500; travel costs of £500; events costs of
£1,000; £375 crowdfunding fees; and a contingency of £500. These meetings will allow us to finalise our
plans for a new regulator, to be launched later this year. We will fundraise separately for the significant costs of launching the regulator itself.</p>
<p>We need to tour the United Kingdom, talking to journalists and
ordinary people about the kind of press they want to see in this country. Do you want to read news, in
print and online, that you can trust? Do you believe that newspaper owners
should be left to regulate themselves? Or do you agree that independent self-regulation is the right solution? If so, please support this project, get in

My name is Jim Newton, and I am the founder of TechShop. I started TechShop because I needed a place to build my hundreds of projects. It turned out that a lot of other people needed the same thing, and that's what has made TechShop such a success!</p>
<p>

I started TechShop because I am a maker, and I personally needed access to a wide range of tools and equipment so I could build my hundreds of ideas. Originally I planned to only build one TechShop (this one in Menlo Park), but it turned out that the idea was a lot bigger than I had anticipated, so we quickly began to expand.</p>
<p>

The land where our original location in Menlo Park is located is being redeveloped, so we have to move TechShop Menlo Park to a new location by Halloween 2013!</p>
<p>

As part of the TechShop Menlo Park community, we ask you to consider backing this Indiegogo campaign in any way you can in order to help us raise $2.5 million so we can move TechShop Menlo Park, and rebuild it as the best TechShop location yet!</p>

Here is a brief video about TechShop and features a few of our members who use TechShop to make an impact on the world, and their own lives:</p>

<span style=""font-size: 18pt; font-weight: bold; color: red; line-height: normal;"">The First TechShop Ever...TechShop Menlo Park</span><p>

I opened the first TechShop in Menlo Park back in October 2006, before there were any hackerspaces or makerspaces in the US. We couldn't just look at another makerspace and copy their model, so we had to design it from scratch. But with the help of our amazing community, we were able to fund it and get it open. Members of our community helped by telling everyone they knew about the TechShop idea, by pre-purchasing memberships, by providing us with $25,000 loans, and by volunteering to help us actually build the facility. As a result, we opened the doors of the very first TechShop on October 1, 2006...almost exactly 7 years ago.</p>
<p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/24220/files/20130820180217-tsmp_jim_in_front_of_building_1024.png?1377046937"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>

As demand grew, we went on to build TechShop San Francisco and TechShop San Jose and crowd-funded more than $5 million for those two locations before there was even such a thing as ""crowd-funding"".</p>
<p>

Today we have six TechShop locations across the US (TechShop Menlo Park, TechShop San Francisco, TechShop San Jose, TechShop Detroit, TechShop Austin, and TechShop Pittsburgh) and five more locations in development including TechShop Chandler AZ in partnership with Arizona State University, which will open in November 2013.</p>
<p>

Our mission is to open hundreds of TechShop locations in the US and other countries and provide everyone with the tools of innovation so they can make amazing things and change the world.</p>
<p>

We employ over 120 full-time employees, hundreds of part-time instructors, and we currently serve nearly 6,000 active members including 850 active members at TechShop Menlo Park. Thousands of people take classes at TechShop every month.</p>
<p>

TechShop has enabled many of its members to launch businesses and products, including some world-changing products and a lot of very successful campaigns on Indiegogo and other crowd-funding platforms.</p>
<p>

TechShop Menlo Park was our very first location...where it all started. I have a personal love for this beat-up old location, and lots of our members love it despite its blemishes. But now TechShop Menlo Park is in danger of being closed if we can't raise funding to move it to a new location.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<span style=""font-size: 18pt; font-weight: bold; color: red; line-height: normal;"">We Have To Move or Close Down!</span><p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>As part of a planned development that has been in the works for a while, our Menlo Park building along with all the other buildings on our block are now slated to be demolished.  So we need to move out of our current building before October 31, 2013...Halloween!</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<span style=""font-size: 18pt; font-weight: bold; color: red; line-height: normal;"">An Exciting and Positive Opportunity</span><p>

We actually see this turn of events as a very positive opportunity for us to make TechShop Menlo Park even better than it is now and add all the new programs that the other TechShop members enjoy.  Yes, the situation is urgent, and if we can't raise the funding we need, then we will need to suspend operations of TechShop Menlo Park, but we are hopeful that you and the rest of the community will step forward and help us raise the money we need and move and rebuild TechShop Menlo Park!</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<span style=""font-size: 18pt; font-weight: bold; color: red; line-height: normal;"">So What's Our Big Plan?</span><p>

We've learned a lot and made a lot of improvements in the TechShop model since we opened this first location back in 2006.</p>
<p>

The new TechShop Menlo Park will feature all brand-new tools and equipment. Right now, TechShop Menlo Park still has a lot of the old used equipment that we started with, but it will all be replaced. If we meet our funding goals, we are going to try our best to add some exciting new program areas including a Flow water jet cutter just like we have in all our other locations, an expanded automotive area with a car lift, a licensed and certified commercial kitchen for member use along with a variety of new cooking classes, a jewelry studio complete with a vacuum metal casting foundry, an expanded electronics lab with all new equipment including LabView software and hardware, a large flex room that can be split into smaller rooms for large and small events and includes a back-of-house catering kitchen for food service at events, and lots more.</p>
<p>

When we build a new TechShop location as we have in San Francisco, San Jose, Detroit, Austin, and Pittsburgh, it takes us about 5 months to design it, get permits, complete the construction, order all the new equipment, and install everything. We have a lot of experience with this now and we have gotten pretty good at it. We anticipate that the permanent new location facility for TechShop Menlo Park will also take about 5 months to build. The problem is that we have to be out of the current building long before then. So rather than shut down TechShop Menlo Park for several months while we build the permanent location, we will move TechShop to a temporary facility while we build out the permanent location.</p>
<p>

The area we are focused on for the temporary location and the permanent location is somewhere within 5 miles of the current TechShop location, and extending a little bit north. Here is a map that shows the region in which we would like to move TechShop Menlo Park:</p>
<p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.techshop.ws/images/tsmp/techshop_menlo_park_area_map.png"" src="""" style=""width: 568px; height: 379px;""/></p>
<p>
<b>The requirements for the temporary building include the following:</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Within 5 miles of TechShop Menlo Park (i.e. Menlo Park, Palo Alto, Redwood City, Stanford, San Mateo, Belmont, San Carlos)<p></p>
</li>
<li>8,000 to 12,000 square feet<p></p>
</li>
<li>10' to 14' clear height<p></p>
</li>
<li>Safe parking for up to 40 cars; some street parking is fine<p></p>
</li>
<li>Ideally slab concrete floor on ground floor. If a second floor, we will need an operable freight elevator<p></p>
</li>
<li>Power: 400-800 amp service at 240V<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Our general plan to move and rebuild TechShop Menlo Park is as follows:</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Secure a temporary location nearby and get ready for move-in<p></p>
</li>
<li>Move to the temporary location by October 31 with less than 2 days downtime<p></p>
</li>
<li>Secure a permanent location and design and build it out, which will take about 5 months<p></p>
</li>
<li>Move TechShop Menlo Park to its new permanent location<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<span style=""font-size: 18pt; font-weight: bold; color: red; line-height: normal;"">We Can't Do This Without Your Help!</span><p>

We are once again turning to you and the rest of our amazing community for help. We need to raise a minimum of $2.5 million to fund the new equipment and build-out costs, and we will raise the money through a combination of fun and exciting perks on Indiegogo, as well as $25,000 loans (not through Indiegogo...for more information about becoming a lender, please see the loan information on our web site <a href=""http://www.techshop.ws/new_tsmp_loans.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #0000ff;"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. The money from the Indiegogo campaign and the money from the loans will be used to build out the temporary facility and the new permanent facility, purchase all brand-new equipment, and put the whole thing together.  The new TechShop Menlo Park will be even more beautiful and amazing than any of the other TechShop locations we have built so far, and will incorporate all the new programs and machines that we have added to the TechShop core over the years.  This is a huge and ambitious project, and we could never do this without the support of you and the rest of our community!</p>

<span style=""font-size: 18pt; font-weight: bold; color: red; line-height: normal;"">More About the ""Get Skills To Work"" Program</span><p>

One big way you can help fund TechShop Menlo Park's move and rebuilding is to contribute as much as you can to our ""Get Skills To Work"" program (you can read more about this in our <a href=""http://www.techshop.ws/veterans.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #0000ff;"" target=""_blank"">Veterans page</a>.</p>

<p>

This fantastic program, which was created by TechShop and our other partners including General Electric, Boeing, LinkedIn, the Gary Sinise Foundation, Alcoa, Lockheed Martin, and many others, provides annual TechShop memberships along with TechShop classes to US Veterans who want to learn new job skills particularly in advanced manufacturing areas such as CNC machining, laser cutting, 3D printing, and computer aided design.  It also provides memberships and classes to veterans who want to explore being entrepreneurs in order to develop a new product, service, or company.</p>
<p>

You can read more about the overall program at the <a href=""http://www.getskillstowork.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #0000ff;"" target=""_blank"">Get Skills To Work web site</a>.</p>
<p>

Here is a brief video of actor Gary Sinise, founder of the Gary Sinise Foundation and one of our partners in the ""Get Skills To Work"" program, talking about just how valuable the program is to veterans:</p>

<p>

100% of the funds raised through the different ""Memberships for US Veterans"" perks in this ""TechShop Menlo Park: Move &amp; Rebuild!"" Indiegogo campaign will be used to provide annual TechShop memberships and classes at absolutely no cost to US Veterans who apply, and the revenue will be applied to the TechShop Menlo Park moving and rebuilding effort. We have already distributed over 1,000 free memberships to veterans since we started the ""Get Skills To Work"" program a few months ago.</p>
<p>

Your contribution will help us provide more of these memberships and classes and help vets build skills to become great potential employees in the private sector, or to develop their own product or company.</p>

<p>

Here are some answers to some of the more common questions people have asked us about our project of moving and rebuilding TechShop Menlo Park:</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<span style=""font-weight: bold; color: red; font-size: 11pt;"">Q: When do you need to be out of the current location?</span><p style=""margin-left: 25px;"">
<span style=""font-weight: bold; color: #7799bb; font-size: 11pt;"">
A: We must be completely out of the building by October 31, 2013. Our goal is to minimize interruption of service to our members and staff as much as possible. We will run classes until the last possible day in the current shop and resume them as soon as we can in the new location.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<span style=""font-weight: bold; color: red; font-size: 11pt;"">
Q: There are already 2 other TechShop locations in the Bay Area within 30 minutes of the TechShop Menlo Park location (TechShop San Francisco and TechShop San Jose). Would you consider moving TechShop Menlo Park to the East Bay or Newark or Santa Rosa or Las Vegas or Sunnyvale or Hawaii or Los Angeles instead of relocating it within 5 miles of the current location?</span><p style=""margin-left: 25px;"">
<span style=""font-weight: bold; color: #7799bb; font-size: 11pt;"">
A. TechShop Menlo Park currently has about 850 active paying members, thousands of people taking classes every month, and a full staff of amazing employees, so we feel it is the right thing to do to keep the new location within 5 miles of the current location.  TechShop Menlo Park members typically do not visit our other two Bay Area locations (TechShop San Francisco and TechShop San Jose), so this data indicates that we need to keep the temporary and new TechShop Menlo Park location in the same vicinity.  We wouldn't want to move TechShop Menlo Park to a location that is too close to TechShop San Francisco or TechShop San Jose.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 25px;"">
<span style=""font-weight: bold; color: #7799bb; font-size: 11pt;"">
However, our goal is to build hundreds and even thousands of TechShop locations in the US and other countries, so it is highly likely that we will eventually build a TechShop in your city.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 25px;"">
<span style=""font-weight: bold; color: #7799bb; font-size: 11pt;"">You can help us get to your city faster by talking with the city leaders, organizations and companies, and raising interest and monetary commitments. We typically need $3.5 million to open a brand-new TechShop location in a given city, and this money can be in the form of large blocks of pre-paid memberships for a 5 or 10 year term, large corporate sponsorships, loans to the local TechShop location, and corporate strategic investments in TechShop corporate to be earmarked for the local TechShop location.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 25px;"">
<span style=""font-weight: bold; color: #7799bb; font-size: 11pt;"">Donations of any amount can be made to our highly successful ""Get Skills To Work"" veteran's membership program which provides free annual memberships and free classes to veterans of all the military branches of the United States of America so they can develop advanced manufacturing skills to be better candidates for jobs, or to gain the skills to start their own businesses. You can find out more about TechShop's ""Get Skills To Work"" program with our partners General Electric, US Department of Veteran's Affairs, Boeing, Alcoa, LinkedIn, Lockheed Martin, US Chamber of Commerce, and many others, at <a href=""http://www.getskillstowork.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #0000ff;"">http://www.getskillstowork.org</a>.</span></p>

<span style=""font-weight: bold; color: red; font-size: 11pt;"">
Q: How can I help fund or donate to TechShop Menlo Park to help with the move and rebuilding?</span><p style=""margin-left: 25px;"">
<span style=""font-weight: bold; color: #7799bb; font-size: 11pt;"">
A: Our Indiegogo campaign, which can be found at ""<a href=""http://igg.me/at/tsmp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #0000ff;"">http://igg.me/at/tsmp</a>"", is the best way to help.  You can also inquire about becoming a lender with $25,000 or more on our web site <a href=""http://www.techshop.ws/new_tsmp_loans.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #0000ff;"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</span></p>

</p>
<hr/>
<span style=""font-weight: bold; color: red; font-size: 11pt;"">
Q: What is the timeline to build a permanent location and move in?</span><p style=""margin-left: 25px;"">
<span style=""font-weight: bold; color: #7799bb; font-size: 11pt;"">
A. It takes about 5 months to build out a full permanent TechShop facility based on the timelines of the additional 5 locations we have built out since we opened TechShop Menlo Park.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<span style=""font-weight: bold; color: red; font-size: 11pt;"">
Q. How can I loan you money to help with the move and rebuilding of TechShop Menlo Park?</span><p style=""margin-left: 25px;"">
<span style=""font-weight: bold; color: #7799bb; font-size: 11pt;"">
A. You can inquire about becoming a lender with $25,000 or more on our web site <a href=""http://www.techshop.ws/new_tsmp_loans.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #0000ff;"">here</a>.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<span style=""font-weight: bold; color: red; font-size: 11pt;"">
Q.  What will the new permanent TechShop Menlo Park look like, and what equipment and facilities will it have for me to use as a member?</span><p style=""margin-left: 25px;"">
<span style=""font-weight: bold; color: #7799bb; font-size: 11pt;"">
A. Our plan is to include all the latest programs and equipment that we have in our other newer TechShop locations, plus some new ones that will first appear at the new TechShop Menlo Park facility.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<span style=""font-weight: bold; color: red; font-size: 11pt;"">
Q.  What happens if you can't find a temporary space in time?</span><p style=""margin-left: 25px;"">
<span style=""font-weight: bold; color: #7799bb; font-size: 11pt;"">
A. Unfortunately, if we are not able to raise the required funding through the Indiegogo campaign and through loans from individuals, we will need to suspend activities at TechShop Menlo Park.  If this were to happen, we would ask current members of TechShop Menlo Park to use either TechShop San Francisco or TechShop San Jose.  We would also offer prorated refunds to members who requested them.  We are quite confident that you and the rest of the TechShop community will help us successfully raise the funds we need to move TechShop Menlo Park and rebuild it to be the best TechShop yet.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<span style=""font-weight: bold; color: red; font-size: 11pt;"">
Q.  Why is your Indiegogo campaign goal $250,000, but you say that you need $2.5 million in order to move and rebuild TechShop Menlo Park?</span><p style=""margin-left: 25px;"">
<span style=""font-weight: bold; color: #7799bb; font-size: 11pt;"">
A. We are raising our funding for moving and rebuilding TechShop Menlo Park from a combination of Indiegogo perks and $25,000 loans from individuals.  We really have no idea how many loans we will secure, and we don't know if we will overshoot or undershoot our Indiegogo goal.  So because of the sage advice from the folks at Indiegogo, we set the goal on our Indiegogo campaign of $250,000 assuming that we will either overshoot on the Indiegogo funding (which would be awesome), or we will be able to raise $2,250,000 in loans, which is 90 people lending us $25,000 each.  Our history supports this idea, as we raised over $5 million in $25,000 loans to open TechShop San Francisco and TechShop San Jose, so we know it is definitely possible to do this and the TechShop community will step up to the challenge.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<span style=""font-weight: bold; color: red; font-size: 11pt;"">
Q.  What happens if you don't raise the full $2.5 million (as a combination of Indiegogo perks and loans) by the end of this Indiegogo campaign?</span><p style=""margin-left: 25px;"">
<span style=""font-weight: bold; color: #7799bb; font-size: 11pt;"">
A. We are pretty confident that we will be able to reach our goal on Indiegogo, and reach our goal of bringing in loans from individuals, since we have done it so many times before with success.  However, if we don't reach our goal by the end of the Indiegogo campaign, we may need to extend our timeline, and there would be a chance that we would have to temporarily suspend operations at TechShop Menlo Park until we are able to raise all the money.  In this case, the equipment would be put into storage, and we would work on completing funding so we could start work on the temporary location and then on the permanent location.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<span style=""font-weight: bold; color: red; font-size: 11pt;"">
Q.  Why do you need $2.5 million to relocate and rebuild TechShop Menlo Park?  Could you do it for less?</span><p style=""margin-left: 25px;"">
<span style=""font-weight: bold; color: #7799bb; font-size: 11pt;"">
A. In our experience, it actually takes $3.5 million to build and open a TechShop location in a new city. TechShop San Francisco and TechShop San Jose ended up costing around that much, but because we raised $2.7 million, we had to do additional fundraising as we continued the build-outs. TechShop Menlo Park is already well-established and has a strong member base, and above all it has been profitable for some time.  Because of these factors, we can build TechShop Menlo Park for much less than it costs us to build a new TechShop in a given city.  Some of the money goes to the ""TIs"" or ""tenant improvements"" which is the build out of the walls and floors and ceilings, HVAC and ventilation systems, electrical, natural gas, water, drainage, air, networking, lighting, safety, signage, access control, and all the infrastructure items.  Some of the money goes to purchasing the new equipment and supporting supplies and fixtures and furnishings.  Some of the money goes to pay for items like tables and chairs, desks, appliances, the front desk, and other such items.  We make a lot of these items ourselves with TechShop equipment.  There is a lot more than immediately meets the eye that goes into a TechShop facility to make it a delightful place to ""build your dreams""!</span></p>

My name is Jim Newton, and I am the founder of TechShop. I started TechShop because I needed a place to build my hundreds of projects. It turned out that a lot of other people needed the same thing, and that's what has made TechShop such a success!


I started TechShop because I am a maker, and I personally needed access to a wide range of tools and equipment so I could build my hundreds of ideas. Originally I planned to only build one TechShop (this one in Menlo Park), but it turned out that the idea was a lot bigger than I had anticipated, so we quickly began to expand.


The land where our original location in Menlo Park is located is being redeveloped, so we have to move TechShop Menlo Park to a new location by Halloween 2013!


As part of the TechShop Menlo Park community, we ask you to consider backing this Indiegogo campaign in any way you can in order to help us raise $2.5 million so we can move TechShop Menlo Park, and rebuild it as the best TechShop location yet!



What Is TechShop?

TechShop is America's first and largest membership-based do-it-yourself workshop that empowers its members to build all the things they have always wanted to make.


Here is a brief video about TechShop and features a few of our members who use TechShop to make an impact on the world, and their own lives:





The First TechShop Ever...TechShop Menlo Park

I opened the first TechShop in Menlo Park back in October 2006, before there were any hackerspaces or makerspaces in the US. We couldn't just look at another makerspace and copy their model, so we had to design it from scratch. But with the help of our amazing community, we were able to fund it and get it open. Members of our community helped by telling everyone they knew about the TechShop idea, by pre-purchasing memberships, by providing us with $25,000 loans, and by volunteering to help us actually build the facility. As a result, we opened the doors of the very first TechShop on October 1, 2006...almost exactly 7 years ago.




As demand grew, we went on to build TechShop San Francisco and TechShop San Jose and crowd-funded more than $5 million for those two locations before there was even such a thing as ""crowd-funding"".


Today we have six TechShop locations across the US (TechShop Menlo Park, TechShop San Francisco, TechShop San Jose, TechShop Detroit, TechShop Austin, and TechShop Pittsburgh) and five more locations in development including TechShop Chandler AZ in partnership with Arizona State University, which will open in November 2013.


Our mission is to open hundreds of TechShop locations in the US and other countries and provide everyone with the tools of innovation so they can make amazing things and change the world.


We employ over 120 full-time employees, hundreds of part-time instructors, and we currently serve nearly 6,000 active members including 850 active members at TechShop Menlo Park. Thousands of people take classes at TechShop every month.


TechShop has enabled many of its members to launch businesses and products, including some world-changing products and a lot of very successful campaigns on Indiegogo and other crowd-funding platforms.


TechShop Menlo Park was our very first location...where it all started. I have a personal love for this beat-up old location, and lots of our members love it despite its blemishes. But now TechShop Menlo Park is in danger of being closed if we can't raise funding to move it to a new location.



We Have To Move or Close Down!


As part of a planned development that has been in the works for a while, our Menlo Park building along with all the other buildings on our block are now slated to be demolished.  So we need to move out of our current building before October 31, 2013...Halloween!



An Exciting and Positive Opportunity

We actually see this turn of events as a very positive opportunity for us to make TechShop Menlo Park even better than it is now and add all the new programs that the other TechShop members enjoy.  Yes, the situation is urgent, and if we can't raise the funding we need, then we will need to suspend operations of TechShop Menlo Park, but we are hopeful that you and the rest of the community will step forward and help us raise the money we need and move and rebuild TechShop Menlo Park!



So What's Our Big Plan?

We've learned a lot and made a lot of improvements in the TechShop model since we opened this first location back in 2006.


The new TechShop Menlo Park will feature all brand-new tools and equipment. Right now, TechShop Menlo Park still has a lot of the old used equipment that we started with, but it will all be replaced. If we meet our funding goals, we are going to try our best to add some exciting new program areas including a Flow water jet cutter just like we have in all our other locations, an expanded automotive area with a car lift, a licensed and certified commercial kitchen for member use along with a variety of new cooking classes, a jewelry studio complete with a vacuum metal casting foundry, an expanded electronics lab with all new equipment including LabView software and hardware, a large flex room that can be split into smaller rooms for large and small events and includes a back-of-house catering kitchen for food service at events, and lots more.


When we build a new TechShop location as we have in San Francisco, San Jose, Detroit, Austin, and Pittsburgh, it takes us about 5 months to design it, get permits, complete the construction, order all the new equipment, and install everything. We have a lot of experience with this now and we have gotten pretty good at it. We anticipate that the permanent new location facility for TechShop Menlo Park will also take about 5 months to build. The problem is that we have to be out of the current building long before then. So rather than shut down TechShop Menlo Park for several months while we build the permanent location, we will move TechShop to a temporary facility while we build out the permanent location.


The area we are focused on for the temporary location and the permanent location is somewhere within 5 miles of the current TechShop location, and extending a little bit north. Here is a map that shows the region in which we would like to move TechShop Menlo Park:



The requirements for the temporary building include the following:



Within 5 miles of TechShop Menlo Park (i.e. Menlo Park, Palo Alto, Redwood City, Stanford, San Mateo, Belmont, San Carlos)

8,000 to 12,000 square feet

10' to 14' clear height

Safe parking for up to 40 cars; some street parking is fine

Ideally slab concrete floor on ground floor. If a second floor, we will need an operable freight elevator

Power: 400-800 amp service at 240V



Our general plan to move and rebuild TechShop Menlo Park is as follows:



Secure a temporary location nearby and get ready for move-in

Move to the temporary location by October 31 with less than 2 days downtime

Secure a permanent location and design and build it out, which will take about 5 months

Move TechShop Menlo Park to its new permanent location





We Can't Do This Without Your Help!

We are once again turning to you and the rest of our amazing community for help. We need to raise a minimum of $2.5 million to fund the new equipment and build-out costs, and we will raise the money through a combination of fun and exciting perks on Indiegogo, as well as $25,000 loans (not through Indiegogo...for more information about becoming a lender, please see the loan information on our web site here. The money from the Indiegogo campaign and the money from the loans will be used to build out the temporary facility and the new permanent facility, purchase all brand-new equipment, and put the whole thing together.  The new TechShop Menlo Park will be even more beautiful and amazing than any of the other TechShop locations we have built so far, and will incorporate all the new programs and machines that we have added to the TechShop core over the years.  This is a huge and ambitious project, and we could never do this without the support of you and the rest of our community!

Frequently Asked Questions


Here are some answers to some of the more common questions people have asked us about our project of moving and rebuilding TechShop Menlo Park:



Q: When do you need to be out of the current location?

A: We must be completely out of the building by October 31, 2013. Our goal is to minimize interruption of service to our members and staff as much as possible. We will run classes until the last possible day in the current shop and resume them as soon as we can in the new location.




Q: There are already 2 other TechShop locations in the Bay Area within 30 minutes of the TechShop Menlo Park location (TechShop San Francisco and TechShop San Jose). Would you consider moving TechShop Menlo Park to the East Bay or Newark or Santa Rosa or Las Vegas or Sunnyvale or Hawaii or Los Angeles instead of relocating it within 5 miles of the current location?

A. TechShop Menlo Park currently has about 850 active paying members, thousands of people taking classes every month, and a full staff of amazing employees, so we feel it is the right thing to do to keep the new location within 5 miles of the current location.  TechShop Menlo Park members typically do not visit our other two Bay Area locations (TechShop San Francisco and TechShop San Jose), so this data indicates that we need to keep the temporary and new TechShop Menlo Park location in the same vicinity.  We wouldn't want to move TechShop Menlo Park to a location that is too close to TechShop San Francisco or TechShop San Jose.


However, our goal is to build hundreds and even thousands of TechShop locations in the US and other countries, so it is highly likely that we will eventually build a TechShop in your city.

You can help us get to your city faster by talking with the city leaders, organizations and companies, and raising interest and monetary commitments. We typically need $3.5 million to open a brand-new TechShop location in a given city, and this money can be in the form of large blocks of pre-paid memberships for a 5 or 10 year term, large corporate sponsorships, loans to the local TechShop location, and corporate strategic investments in TechShop corporate to be earmarked for the local TechShop location.

Donations of any amount can be made to our highly successful ""Get Skills To Work"" veteran's membership program which provides free annual memberships and free classes to veterans of all the military branches of the United States of America so they can develop advanced manufacturing skills to be better candidates for jobs, or to gain the skills to start their own businesses. You can find out more about TechShop's ""Get Skills To Work"" program with our partners General Electric, US Department of Veteran's Affairs, Boeing, Alcoa, LinkedIn, Lockheed Martin, US Chamber of Commerce, and many others, at http://www.getskillstowork.org.




Q: How can I help fund or donate to TechShop Menlo Park to help with the move and rebuilding?

A: Our Indiegogo campaign, which can be found at ""http://igg.me/at/tsmp"", is the best way to help.  You can also inquire about becoming a lender with $25,000 or more on our web site here.




Q: What is the timeline to build a permanent location and move in?

A. It takes about 5 months to build out a full permanent TechShop facility based on the timelines of the additional 5 locations we have built out since we opened TechShop Menlo Park.




Q. How can I loan you money to help with the move and rebuilding of TechShop Menlo Park?

A. You can inquire about becoming a lender with $25,000 or more on our web site here.




Q.  What will the new permanent TechShop Menlo Park look like, and what equipment and facilities will it have for me to use as a member?

A. Our plan is to include all the latest programs and equipment that we have in our other newer TechShop locations, plus some new ones that will first appear at the new TechShop Menlo Park facility.




Q.  What happens if you can't find a temporary space in time?

A. Unfortunately, if we are not able to raise the required funding through the Indiegogo campaign and through loans from individuals, we will need to suspend activities at TechShop Menlo Park.  If this were to happen, we would ask current members of TechShop Menlo Park to use either TechShop San Francisco or TechShop San Jose.  We would also offer prorated refunds to members who requested them.  We are quite confident that you and the rest of the TechShop community will help us successfully raise the funds we need to move TechShop Menlo Park and rebuild it to be the best TechShop yet.




Q.  Why is your Indiegogo campaign goal $250,000, but you say that you need $2.5 million in order to move and rebuild TechShop Menlo Park?

A. We are raising our funding for moving and rebuilding TechShop Menlo Park from a combination of Indiegogo perks and $25,000 loans from individuals.  We really have no idea how many loans we will secure, and we don't know if we will overshoot or undershoot our Indiegogo goal.  So because of the sage advice from the folks at Indiegogo, we set the goal on our Indiegogo campaign of $250,000 assuming that we will either overshoot on the Indiegogo funding (which would be awesome), or we will be able to raise $2,250,000 in loans, which is 90 people lending us $25,000 each.  Our history supports this idea, as we raised over $5 million in $25,000 loans to open TechShop San Francisco and TechShop San Jose, so we know it is definitely possible to do this and the TechShop community will step up to the challenge.




Q.  What happens if you don't raise the full $2.5 million (as a combination of Indiegogo perks and loans) by the end of this Indiegogo campaign?

A. We are pretty confident that we will be able to reach our goal on Indiegogo, and reach our goal of bringing in loans from individuals, since we have done it so many times before with success.  However, if we don't reach our goal by the end of the Indiegogo campaign, we may need to extend our timeline, and there would be a chance that we would have to temporarily suspend operations at TechShop Menlo Park until we are able to raise all the money.  In this case, the equipment would be put into storage, and we would work on completing funding so we could start work on the temporary location and then on the permanent location.




Q.  Why do you need $2.5 million to relocate and rebuild TechShop Menlo Park?  Could you do it for less?

A. In our experience, it actually takes $3.5 million to build and open a TechShop location in a new city. TechShop San Francisco and TechShop San Jose ended up costing around that much, but because we raised $2.7 million, we had to do additional fundraising as we continued the build-outs. TechShop Menlo Park is already well-established and has a strong member base, and above all it has been profitable for some time.  Because of these factors, we can build TechShop Menlo Park for much less than it costs us to build a new TechShop in a given city.  Some of the money goes to the ""TIs"" or ""tenant improvements"" which is the build out of the walls and floors and ceilings, HVAC and ventilation systems, electrical, natural gas, water, drainage, air, networking, lighting, safety, signage, access control, and all the infrastructure items.  Some of the money goes to purchasing the new equipment and supporting supplies and fixtures and furnishings.  Some of the money goes to pay for items like tables and chairs, desks, appliances, the front desk, and other such items.  We make a lot of these items ourselves with TechShop equipment.  There is a lot more than immediately meets the eye that goes into a TechShop facility to make it a delightful place to ""build your dreams""!



Please Back This Campaign Right Now By Choosing As Many of the Perks as you Can!

It is only with the generous support of you and everyone else in the TechShop community that we will be able to move and rebuild TechShop Menlo Park for everyone to enjoy.

<p>Six years ago, a group of youth and adults from the First United Methodist Church of Alachua, Florida traveled to the Harvest Deaf Bible College in Ringgold, Georgia for a mission trip. It was there that our passion for serving the deaf community was born, but we weren’t sure where that passion would lead us. The following summer, we embarked on our first international mission trip to the Dominican Republic. We ran a series of medical clinics in some of the poorest neighborhoods of Santo Domingo. One of the clinics was held at a church that also housed a school for deaf children founded by an American missionary. The youth on our trip immediately bonded with the children from the school and spent the afternoon doing what kids do -- playing chess, checkers, and cards –- just having fun. Even though at that time none of us knew sign language, we soon learned that love and laughter knew no language barriers. Later in the week, we took all the children from the school to an interactive science museum in the city. Watching the children explore the different interactive displays was such an amazing experience: they were so excited! Seeing little things bring them so much joy inspired us to want to do something more for these children, but we still weren’t sure what.</p>
<p>Later that year, the vision started to become clear – we wanted to host a summer camp for all of the children from the school; and in June of 2009 we held our inaugural summer camp, Camp Hands of Joy. Since then we have traveled to the Dominican Republic every summer to host summer camp for the children. Our team has grown from our original 12 volunteers to about 30 American team members, including other volunteers from our local community. A group of students, alumni and affiliates of Rochester Institute of Technology’s ASL-English Interpretation Program in Rochester, New York have also joined the team. Numerous native Dominican volunteers have also partnered with us to help run the camp. Over time, more than half of our team members have become proficient at sign language as a second language. The group of Dominican children attending Camp Hands of Joy has grown from about 40 children in 2009 to over 80 children in 2012.</p>
<p>During the week, the children receive 3 nutritious meals a day and enjoy fun, supervised camp activities including games, sports, crafts, drama and swimming. In addition, morning and evening chapel services and a small group discussion session are held each day. The camp facilities in the Dominican Republic are extremely primitive, but to these children, many of whom have live in appalling conditions, it is like a 5-star hotel. They feel safe and loved, and have an opportunity to just be a child.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, there are costs involved in organizing and running a week-long camp in a different part of the world for over a hundred participants. Without fundraising efforts like this one, it would be impossible for us to continue year after year. Your generous contribution will allow us to continue putting on this camp and bring a special joy to these children’s lives.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need </strong></p>
<p>Each year, the camp costs approximately $25,000 to put on. The costs are broken down as follows*:</p>
<ul>
<li>Travel costs for the team - $700 per member (total cost varies depending on the number of volunteer team members)</li>
<li>Room and board at camp (including food) - $50 per person, including volunteer team members, children and teaching staff</li>
<li>Bus transportation for the children from their school in Santo Domingo to camp and back to the school again - $1,000</li>
<li>Camp Supplies - $1,000</li>
</ul><p>*Amounts are estimates and vary slightly from year to year.</p>
<p>Most of the families of the deaf Dominican children could not afford to provide a week-long camp experience of this nature for their child, so it is generous sponsorships and volunteer staffing that make Camp Hands of Joy possible. Will you please consider joining with us this year as we make June 16th- June 22nd, 2013, a very special week for the children? Without you, Camp Hands of Joy would not exist. No donation is too small.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>In the Dominican Republic deafness is looked upon as a disease and most children born deaf are not accepted in their families or their communities. The public school system is unable to deal with the specialized language needs of deaf children, so they are often lumped with mentally disabled children and labeled ""unable to learn"" even though many of them are incredibly intelligent and capable. Many deaf children do not learn any language, even things as basic as their own name, until age 9 or 10. Their families do not make the effort to learn sign language, so the children often lack any form of communication in their homes. For the most part, they are ignored and abused and are often left feeling isolated and alone. While there have been some efforts made by government, a few international agencies, and religious ministries to help educate deaf children, they are still left with little access to the everyday activities and fun which are common to other children their age.</p>
<p>About 10 years ago, an American Missionary, Peggy Blevins, started a small school in the capital city of Santo Domingo to help the deaf children in that area. Today, the school is in operation and currently has a waiting list of several children who are hoping to leave their life of isolation and enter a world where their potential can be realized. The school starts by giving the children a language, American Sign Language, which makes it possible for them to communicate. This basic fundamental skill provides opportunities they have never had before. Once the children learn sign language, their school experience is a typical one, learning reading and writing, Spanish and math. Most importantly, the teachers share with the children God's love that transcends whatever troubles they encounter in their lives.</p>
<p>The school has made an amazing impact on the deaf children of Santo Domingo, but there are limitations to the things that can be taught in a classroom environment. Children need to play and interact in a healthy, outdoor environment rich with teachable moments. Camp Hands of Joy provides that environment and is a wonderful compliment to the school. The children have the opportunity to not only spend a fun week with their friends from the deaf school, but also with deaf adult role models, and hearing people who know and love their language and are actively engaged in communicating with them. Over the past 5 years we have watched what once were shy, awkward, insecure children become loving, confident, self-sufficient individuals. It’s easy to see the impact Camp Hands of Joy makes on the children. We see it in their excited faces as they return to camp each summer, and in their tears as they say “until next year” to their American friends at the end of the week and return to their homes – confident that they are loved.</p>

The youth on our trip immediately bonded with the children from the school and spent the afternoon doing what kids do -- playing chess, checkers, and cards –- just having fun. Even though at that time none of us knew sign language, we soon learned that love and laughter knew no language barriers. Later in the week, we took all the children from the school to an interactive science museum in the city. Watching the children explore the different interactive displays was such an amazing experience: they were so excited! Seeing little things bring them so much joy inspired us to want to do something more for these children, but we still weren’t sure what.
Later that year, the vision started to become clear – we wanted to host a summer camp for all of the children from the school; and in June of 2009 we held our inaugural summer camp, Camp Hands of Joy. Since then we have traveled to the Dominican Republic every summer to host summer camp for the children. Our team has grown from our original 12 volunteers to about 30 American team members, including other volunteers from our local community. A group of students, alumni and affiliates of Rochester Institute of Technology’s ASL-English Interpretation Program in Rochester, New York have also joined the team. Numerous native Dominican volunteers have also partnered with us to help run the camp. Over time, more than half of our team members have become proficient at sign language as a second language. The group of Dominican children attending Camp Hands of Joy has grown from about 40 children in 2009 to over 80 children in 2012.
During the week, the children receive 3 nutritious meals a day and enjoy fun, supervised camp activities including games, sports, crafts, drama and swimming. In addition, morning and evening chapel services and a small group discussion session are held each day. The camp facilities in the Dominican Republic are extremely primitive, but to these children, many of whom have live in appalling conditions, it is like a 5-star hotel. They feel safe and loved, and have an opportunity to just be a child.
As you can imagine, there are costs involved in organizing and running a week-long camp in a different part of the world for over a hundred participants. Without fundraising efforts like this one, it would be impossible for us to continue year after year. Your generous contribution will allow us to continue putting on this camp and bring a special joy to these children’s lives.
What We Need 
Each year, the camp costs approximately $25,000 to put on. The costs are broken down as follows*:

Travel costs for the team - $700 per member (total cost varies depending on the number of volunteer team members)
Room and board at camp (including food) - $50 per person, including volunteer team members, children and teaching staff
Bus transportation for the children from their school in Santo Domingo to camp and back to the school again - $1,000
Camp Supplies - $1,000
*Amounts are estimates and vary slightly from year to year.
Most of the families of the deaf Dominican children could not afford to provide a week-long camp experience of this nature for their child, so it is generous sponsorships and volunteer staffing that make Camp Hands of Joy possible. Will you please consider joining with us this year as we make June 16th- June 22nd, 2013, a very special week for the children? Without you, Camp Hands of Joy would not exist. No donation is too small.
The Impact
In the Dominican Republic deafness is looked upon as a disease and most children born deaf are not accepted in their families or their communities. The public school system is unable to deal with the specialized language needs of deaf children, so they are often lumped with mentally disabled children and labeled ""unable to learn"" even though many of them are incredibly intelligent and capable. Many deaf children do not learn any language, even things as basic as their own name, until age 9 or 10. Their families do not make the effort to learn sign language, so the children often lack any form of communication in their homes. For the most part, they are ignored and abused and are often left feeling isolated and alone. While there have been some efforts made by government, a few international agencies, and religious ministries to help educate deaf children, they are still left with little access to the everyday activities and fun which are common to other children their age.
About 10 years ago, an American Missionary, Peggy Blevins, started a small school in the capital city of Santo Domingo to help the deaf children in that area. Today, the school is in operation and currently has a waiting list of several children who are hoping to leave their life of isolation and enter a world where their potential can be realized. The school starts by giving the children a language, American Sign Language, which makes it possible for them to communicate. This basic fundamental skill provides opportunities they have never had before. Once the children learn sign language, their school experience is a typical one, learning reading and writing, Spanish and math. Most importantly, the teachers share with the children God's love that transcends whatever troubles they encounter in their lives.
The school has made an amazing impact on the deaf children of Santo Domingo, but there are limitations to the things that can be taught in a classroom environment. Children need to play and interact in a healthy, outdoor environment rich with teachable moments. Camp Hands of Joy provides that environment and is a wonderful compliment to the school. The children have the opportunity to not only spend a fun week with their friends from the deaf school, but also with deaf adult role models, and hearing people who know and love their language and are actively engaged in communicating with them. Over the past 5 years we have watched what once were shy, awkward, insecure children become loving, confident, self-sufficient individuals. It’s easy to see the impact Camp Hands of Joy makes on the children. We see it in their excited faces as they return to camp each summer, and in their tears as they say “until next year” to their American friends at the end of the week and return to their homes – confident that they are loved.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Extend our Catalyst Program, which is set out to contribute to reducing the unemployment rate.

Build an online platform and web application for enke Program Alumni and other Youth to access information, resources and training to catalyse their social impact and entrepreneurship.
Hold a conference to build collaboration and share knowledge and resources in the youth development sector.
 Why This Is ImportantThe odds are stacked against youth in South Africa:
55% are unemployed;
Nearly 8 million are not currently engaged in education or employment;
72% live on less that R30 ($2) a day;
22% do not have access to resources that can help them find employment
We engage and equip the youth of South Africa to be the solution to the challenges they face as an individual and within their community.We want all youth to have the networks, entrepreneurial skills and inspiration necessary to realise their value and thrive.One way we do this is through our Catalyst Program. Our programs and services empower and support young people to create meaningful change on the issues they care most about, whilst developing their own skills.  We train and inspire young people, aged 15-30 years, to develop innovative solutions to create and achieve a positive future for themselves and their communities. For more information about our programs and for our contact details visit https://enke.co.za/",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Last summer, a small group of LGBTQ youth of color from across Detroit came together to discuss problems in our community, and teach one another media-making skills that would empower us to create our own home-grown solutions.</p>
<p>A core group of 8 youth committed ourselves to community organizing, making media, and building lasting relationships -- and now we're planning to re-convene, to create an ongoing collective of youth and community allies, committed to solving problems through collaborative media production. To find out more about us, you can check out our website, <a href=""http://detroitrepresent.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to be ready for our October launch date, we'll need to raise $6,435 by September 30. This will buy us:</p>
<p>A set of quality media-making <strong>equipment</strong> that'll last for years to come (including computers, cameras, and audio recorders). We budgeted $4,175 for this.</p>
<p><strong>Groceries!</strong> Since each cycle of Detroit REPRESENT! includes a family-style dinner, we'll need to buy groceries for each participant, for each time we meet. We'll save money by cooking the food ourselves, which we figure is a great way to bond and build community, too! This will cost $1,800.</p>
<p>Enough <strong>gas money</strong> to pick up and drop off each youth participant, before and after meetings. Detroit is a big city, after all, and transportation is a big deal, here. We'll need $460 to cover 12 weeks of transportation. </p>
<p>As Detroiters, nobody knows better than we do that community is the greatest resource we've got. We know that, in times of struggle, we're more capable than ever of creation, and we're committed to tellings stories of resilience, passion, innovation, and empowerment across our city. We also know that our project can't become a reality without financial support. To say thanks, we've thought up perks that include original art and media-pieces, educational sessions, and even a special thank-you dinner and dialogue, where we can get to know each other in person! </p>
<p>If we're not able to meet our entire fundraising goal, we'll spend the money we do raise on purchasing media equipment. The media equipment is the most essential piece of our fundraising goal, because these tools will last for years, and enable us to keep doing the work of community problem-solving in Detroit. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Mission of Detroit REPRESENT! is to resist erasure and misportrayal by actively engaging in the work of self-education and self-empowerment, to create a revolutionary media alternative that authentically portrays our communities, our lives, and our selves.</p>
<p>Through our project, we'll work to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase authentic, grassroots representation of LGBTQ youth of color in the media</li>
<li>Tackle serious problems affecting Detroit, such as homelessness, addiction, gentrification, racisim, segregation, violence, and the educational crisis</li>
<li>Develop and nurture powerful relationships, and solidarity, across communities of color</li>
<li>Empower LGBTQ youth of color to see themselves as agents of change, in their lives and in the world!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you're not able to donate, but still want to get involved, we'd love to hear from you! Some additional forms of support we're looking for at this time include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>In-Kind Donations.</strong> If you've got a digital camera, old laptop, blank sketchbook, set of colored pencils, or can of spray paint you're not using, send it our way! Any art and media supplies we get will help us make our project a reality!</li>
<li>
<strong>Community Allies!</strong> If you're local, and want to support us as a community ally, we're looking for some friends and neighbors who no longer self-identify as youth, to help us by providing transportation to and from meetings, supporting fundraising campaigns (like this one), helping us cook weekly dinners, and participating in roundtable conversation.</li>
<li>
<strong>Getting the Word Out. </strong>Know a youth who might want to get involved? An event we should hook up with? A neighbor looking to volunteer in the fall? We're looking to expand our support base far and wide, so tell a friend! You can use the Indigogo ""share"" feature to tell your online network. </li>

<h3>Our Story<br/>
</h3>
<p><i>We are four high school students raising money to complete the construction of a homeless shelter in Armenia, El Salvador. This is our third year working with the shelter and have traveled down to El Salvador twice and will return in April 2011 to donate the funds. In our third year of involvement we hope to educate others about our cause, inspire them to embark on similar journeys, gain a cultural understanding and connection with El Salvador, and take our fundraising to the next level in order to complete the homeless shelter. The fundraising aspect of our goal is only possible with your help.  </i><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Two years ago, we had an idea. We were merely freshmen in high school, and we knew little of global injustices and hardships. During our spring semester, we got connected with Las Señoras de la Caridad, a group of elderly El Salvadorian women who work to better their community of Armenia, El Salvador. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Francesca, one of the four members of our group, has deep connections with the town and organization because of her paternal family's presence in the town. Her grandmother, the leader of this group, spoke to Francesca about a plan to build a homeless shelter. The construction of the shelter had been stopped due to lack of lunds. Francesca, along with her three closest friends: Emma, Emily, and Sara, teamed up to begin a project that would support the continuation of construction on the shelter. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Taking on this project seemed daunting to us. We weren't part of a larger organization and we didn't possess any type of foundation to build off of. But we had an idea: we could do it on our own. While our parents were supportive, not everyone else could grasp the idea of four fourteen year olds initiating such a large project. As one member of the administration at our school asked us, ""You guys are just going to go to El Salvador and build a homeless shelter?"" While we were slightly discouraged by this opposition, our answer was a firm ""Yes."" <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Today the shelter stands with three walls and a roof. Over the past two years we have organized bake sales, garage sales, and a letter campaign, in total raising over $3,000. While delivering the money we had raised, we also laid bricks and did other miscellaneous jobs around the construction site. Getting our hands dirty and seeing the money we had raised be put to use was the most rewarding part. We were adopted by Las Señoras de la Caridad our first year there and honored with the name ""Las Chicas de La Caridad."" </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Beyond the financial aspect of our cause, we have developed a unique connection with the community we seek to help. Through attending town celebrations we have been able to interact with the people of Armenia. It has been very interesting to explore a community so different from our own, so impoverished, yet so generous and welcoming. Previously the people of El Salvador might have felt differently towards privileged American students, but we hope that our presence in El Salvador has altered their preconceptions. Our connections have made the experience all the more rewarding and a mutual understand between our separate cultures has developed.</p>

Why Peace?
Because it is about time. Because ever since I can remember myself there was always war, of some sort. And there were always casualties: Israelis, Palestinians, Jews, Muslims, Christians- everyone's blood is red. The pain of a mother who loses her daughter makes no distinctions. We all hurt; we all bleed- it is about time we start living and not just surviving.

I am an Israeli, who is tired of this conflict. I am a woman who is weary of seeing other women not getting the same opportunities I have because they live on ""the wrong side"" of the wall. I am a Peace Worker, who has been active around the world and would like to bring this work home, so our children can live freely; so we can enjoy the full potential of this country and its people.  I want to bring this home so fear, that nourishes the militaristic ideology, is not longer the main issue that shapes all other realms in the country.
I want to bring this home so you, and I can slowly but surely change the way an entire nation thinks, because only if we change the hearts and minds of the people- the state will follow.
My name is Ori Talmor. I am an MA student at the University of Innsbruck, Austria and I love my country--I want to be part of it--but not like this. I want to be part of a change--and need your help for that.
Peace Studies as a way for Transformation
The Peace Studies program at the University of Innsbruck in Austria is a unique program that was strongly inspired by the UNESCO's famous Manifesto 2000, which proposed to turn the new millennium into a new beginning, an opportunity to change, all together, the culture of war and violence into a culture of peace and non-violence. You can see the program’s website for more detailed description of the program and the curriculum: 
http://www.uibk.ac.at/peacestudies/ma-program/
I have one more semester left to graduate, this coming Summer term 2012, and in order to do that I need to raise $8000. 
This money will cover 4000 Euro tuition costs (equivalent to $5400), air fare costs (estimated $1500) and living expenses for this period (estimated $1100). 
Why this, why me?  
Because through this program I can gain the needed tools to work with conflict; the skills needed to work for peace. They say that one can only start contemplating peace if one is at peace- and this is what Innsbruck Peace Program is about. It guides you through the obstacles and provides you with the opportunity of transformation. So I can create a blueprint, a fully fledged plan for integrating new attitudes into the society, breaking apart fears and preconceived approaches, reframing them in a structure that will lead these two torn nations towards reintegration and healing.
Why me? Because I care.
Because it is part of who I am; part of how I am. It has been quite some time since I realized there is nothing else I can do in my life except to work for a change, for justice, for reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians. I can try to run away from it, and I did— but somehow I always came back to it. This conflict is part of who I am, and only by working to transform it- can I fulfill my calling.!

Because you're looking at a transgender video project on Indiegogo, I'll assume it would probably be okay with you. You'd love them unconditionally and do your very best to help that child grow up to reach their highest potential.</p>
<p>Unfortunately that's not the norm. Many thousands of parents in America will part ways with their child when they discover that their child is transgender. If the child is too young yet to be abandoned, they mistreat and bully the child into conforming unnaturally to the role of their outward gender. And this ultimately leads to years of frustration, confusion, pain and hopelessness for the transgender child.</p>
<p>What these parents don't understand is that being transgender is not ""choosing to be a weirdo,"" as one parent put it, but a natural, biological occurrence - the phenomenon of a girl's brain, heart, and emotions born prisoner in a boy's body, or vice versa. But in America, especially rural America, and in many churches, transgender young people are literally demonized, run out of town, and in many cases, murdered or driven to commit suicide.</p>
<p>The lack of familial and communal acceptance is why 40% of transgender people don't make it to age 30. Transgender people are probably the most misunderstood and wrongly persecuted section of humanity in America.</p>
<p>The root of the problem is simple. It's misunderstanding. And what people don't understand, they fear, hate, shun and condemn.</p>
<p>My film Transgendervention will prevent parents from rejecting and ejecting their transgender children by bridging these gaps in understanding with upfront and in-depth medical, biological, and psychological information from doctors, scientists and therapists who specialize in the study and treatment of transgender people. This documentary will provide vital and current information especially for transgender youth and their families in the hopes that by illuminating and educating them, families will not turn their backs on their transgender children, but continue to love and support them for who they are, and have enough knowledge to be able to spread understanding, themselves.</p>
<p>Many transgender adolescents who may be in the position of ""coming out"" have a narrow and extremely critical window of opportunity to either win the understanding and acceptance of their families or lose those relationships forever. It is my goal, my mission, to provide a film that will explain to these parents what their child is experiencing and why and how these kids can grow up to lead happy and productive lives within a loving and supportive family, and not out on the street. It will be a way they can come out without getting kicked out.</p>
<p>Through interviews with doctors and experts, I will present the biological and physiological reasons why a transgender child may feel that they are ""in the wrong body"" and unable to conform to gender norms. I will present the importance and benefits of aiding transgender kids in their transition at an earlier age so that they can be who they are, and not have to suppress their self-identities throughout their young lives. My interviews will also provide ample, sound advice on bullying, social situations, personal safety considerations, religious opposition and transgender-specific legal issues.</p>
<p>Finally we will demonstrate that there has always been this ""third sex"" of people and briefly give some examples of societal acceptance and admiration of transgender people in other cultures.</p>
<p>This documentary will be a one-stop, best bet source of education for families starting on the path of transition, and will provide them with the resources, knowledge, and reassurance to continue loving and caring for their child.</p>
<p>It is my sincerest hope that this documentary will reach any misguided families of transgender children before they throw their children out of their homes like so many before them, and be a source of light and guidance for others who may have little or no access to the resources and information presented in this film.</p>
<p>Before its release, I will test this film on numerous conservative, uptight, backwards, prejudiced audiences to see if it can bridge the gap in their understanding of trans people as these will be its target demographics and the type of audiences on which it most needs to reach.</p>
<p>This is a monumentally important project. I just need your financial support to make it happen! </p>
<p>Your money will go to fund travel expenses for my interviews of doctors, therapists, and experts in the field of gender dysphoria, and interviews of model families of transgender children. Your money will pay for production, equipment rental, studio time, editing, post-production, music scoring, and distribution costs. I also need funds to enter this documentary in film festivals, not necessarily to win them, but to let people know it is available to them.</p>
<p>The more funds I can raise, the better this film will be. So please, donate.</p>
<p>Additionally, Josh Lehrer, the amazing photographer who did the project ""Becoming Visible: Portraits of Homeless Transgender Teens"" has agreed to let me to use some of his beautiful and heart-rending photographs taken on the streets of NYC in presenting the statistics on transgender homelessness and mortality. Thank you, Josh!</p>

<p>Bonjour , </p>
<p>      Je m'appelle <strong>Ryan Bernard</strong> , j'ai 19 ans et j'habite à Nantes , en France. Sortant d'un Bac scientifique ,j'ai choisi de me diriger vers l'ostéopathie pour accomplir mon projet de vie .</p>
<p>      En effet l'ostéopathie à dans ma vie une place a part entiere puisque je suis baigné dedans:</p>
<ul>
<li> Ayant fait plus d'<strong>une dizaine de pneumonie à la naissance</strong> , je grandis avec des poumons atrophiés a plus de 50%. De ce fait , depuis que je suis nourisson , je suis suivi par multiples kinésitherapeutes et Ostéopathes. J'en comprend donc toute l'utilité et <strong>les bienfaits que cette profession</strong> peut avoir sur le corps humain.   </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Ensuite , une des motivations premieres de ce projet est le fait de<strong> soutenir ma maman dans sa maladie</strong> . Atteinte de plusieurs maladies musculo-squelettiques ( Fibromyalgie, spondylarthrite ankylosante etc.. ) Si je peux , en tant qu'ostéopathe , lui apporter une quelquoncque améliorations a son état de santé ,<strong> je me donnerais a 300% !</strong>
</li>
<li>Enfin , pratiquant le full-contact depuis maintenant 14ans, je suis maintenant  multiples fois champions de France dans toutes les disciplines et j'ai recemment obtenu <strong>une medaille de Bronze aux championnats du monde en Slovaquie</strong>. Le full contact etant un sport de contact , je vous laisse imaginer les degats et desordres que ca peut engendrer sur le corps humain et la aussi , je constate les merveilles que peuvent effectuer les ostéopathes.</li>

<h3>Education is the great equalizer </h3>

<p>I am currently a Senior at Whittier College in California. I started my college education right after high school but withdrew from school when my mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. I worked in education for several years, helping my family make ends meet before returning to school full time for my degree. Every semester has been a challenge to afford books and fees. I don't receive financial help from family. My mom is retired/disabled and I am a fully indpendent student. I regularly work 7 days a week as an assistant, dog-walker, babysitter, and tutor.  </p>

the workshop we want our students to be able to know and understand themselves

<p>Sometimes, you see the very best in people in response to the very worst of tragedies.</p>
<p>Last Wednesday, after the tragic murder of Corporal Nathan Cirillo and the attack on our Parliament -- just one day after the brutal attack and murder of Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent in Quebec -- we were just like every other Canadian we knew. We felt sad, powerless, and angry.</p>
<p>We found ourselves glued to our smartphones and screens, watching a massive outpouring of emotional content being shared on Facebook, Twitter and media stories.</p>
<p>With a few tweets back and forth, Chad (sitting in his living in room in Toronto) and Kaz (in the back of an Uber car in San Francisco), a fund was created.  Our team quickly grew to include friends and colleagues from all across Canada. </p>
<p>Within 10 hours, our $10,000 goal was achieved, and more than a dozen people had fanned out to create graphics, start a social media campaign, talk to their colleagues and engage the mainstream media. Within 18 hours, our friend Gary Clement from TD Bank, before anyone asked, blew our original goal out of the water by organizing TD, Scotiabank, CIBC and RBC for a combined $80,000 donation. Canada’s four best banks stepped up with massive donations that started a momentum we never dreamed of.</p>
<p>Everyone we reached out to had a shared goal: to show these families that a whole nation grieved with them. Their loved ones didn’t die in vain: they died for us, and they will never, ever be forgotten.</p>
<p>Canada’s foremost charity dedicated to helping veterans and their families, True Patriot Love (TPL) Foundation, stepped up and agreed to be our implementing partner, handling complicated financial, legal and other issues.

</div></div>","Dear friends & fellow supporters,


Sometimes, you see the very best in people in response to the very worst of tragedies.
Last Wednesday, after the tragic murder of Corporal Nathan Cirillo and the attack on our Parliament -- just one day after the brutal attack and murder of Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent in Quebec -- we were just like every other Canadian we knew. We felt sad, powerless, and angry.
We found ourselves glued to our smartphones and screens, watching a massive outpouring of emotional content being shared on Facebook, Twitter and media stories.
With a few tweets back and forth, Chad (sitting in his living in room in Toronto) and Kaz (in the back of an Uber car in San Francisco), a fund was created.  Our team quickly grew to include friends and colleagues from all across Canada. 
Within 10 hours, our $10,000 goal was achieved, and more than a dozen people had fanned out to create graphics, start a social media campaign, talk to their colleagues and engage the mainstream media. Within 18 hours, our friend Gary Clement from TD Bank, before anyone asked, blew our original goal out of the water by organizing TD, Scotiabank, CIBC and RBC for a combined $80,000 donation. Canada’s four best banks stepped up with massive donations that started a momentum we never dreamed of.
Everyone we reached out to had a shared goal: to show these families that a whole nation grieved with them. Their loved ones didn’t die in vain: they died for us, and they will never, ever be forgotten.
Canada’s foremost charity dedicated to helping veterans and their families, True Patriot Love (TPL) Foundation, stepped up and agreed to be our implementing partner, handling complicated financial, legal and other issues. TPL’s Managing Director, Bronwen Evans, has been there for the regiments and the families throughout. Her leadership has helped us guarantee with absolute confidence that 100% of every dollar raised will reach the families.
Some say that Canadians are apathetic, that online activism is just a bunch of clicks and wasted time. Our answer is simple: in just 7 days, Canadians raised $700,000 for two families whose loved ones were murdered wearing our country’s uniform.  Individuals, religious groups, associations, unions and companies donated as little as $1 and as much as $50,000. 
We cannot thank you enough for donating, sharing and stepping up so that all of our grief, shock and sadness could be turned into a living, lasting memorial for these two families.

We feel our project will inspire students of all ages to unleash their creativity, as well as prove that there is no dream that is too big!

</div></div>","Common Vision is setting our aim at changing the lives of 1,000,000 kids by providing the fresh food and eco-literacy that is so badly needed. The #GrowFruitGrowPower campaign will lay the groundwork to grow fruit tree orchards at 1,000 low-income schools.
Every child deserves the chance to benefit from having a direct relationship with healthy and organic food. But social inequality deprives many kids of this privilege.  By creating organic fruit orchards at low-income schools, Common Vision has created this relationship for more than 100,000 children.Your support of this campaign will allow us to bring our innovational brand of education to 30 additional schools and 15,000 more kids in the next year alone and to scale to hundreds more in the coming decade.  Together we can continue to give children the equal access to the healthy food they deserve.Many of us take for granted the privilege of eating healthy foods.  Whether you purchase from farmer’s markets, grocery stores, or harvest from your own gardens - access to quality food pays real dividends, in immediate and long-term development, health, and wellbeing.Now, imagine how not having access to fresh and healthy foods would impact your life.  For many of the 3,655,624 students receiving free and reduced-priced lunches in California, public schools often provide their only healthy meal options. For the 100,000 kids at 215 public schools, Common Vision plays a critical role in student health by delivering access to free, fresh, organic fruit.Common Vision’s California School Orchard Project provides 100,000 low-income students with fresh fruit every year.  Schools looking to nourish and educate their students contact us every week requesting an orchard.  Unfortunately the wait list for our program can be as long as 3 years; without your support, we cannot help them.We’re counting on you, today, to become the newest supporter of Common Vision with a contribution.Every bit helps us get to our goal. 


Gardens are a cornerstone of nutritional and environmental education in schools across the country. 

Unfortunately in many California schools, gardens are under-staffed, under-utilized, and just not growing much food.  In a modern world wrestling with countless ecological and health crises, it is more important than ever for all children to be environmentally and nutritionally literate.
Formed in 2005, Common Vision is a non-profit that delivers inspirational environmental education.  Over the past 10 years we’ve planted more than 6,000 fruit trees throughout California and built a reputation for improving the lives of students and teachers.  Not only do Common Vision orchards produce 150,000 lbs of organic fruit every year (so far), they are also living classrooms where kids learn about environmental science, climate change, nutrition, and teamwork.  


We have accomplished all this with amazingly small budget, and are currently struggling  to support our existing network of schools and to respond to new requests for help.

We have a solid foundation of dedicated and knowledgeable staff, the needed tools and materials, an army of energized volunteers, and over a decade of experience to help us meet the overwhelming demand and expand Common Vision orchards to 1,000 schools by year 2025.




Common Vision takes a unique approach of using fruit trees and other perennials to create extremely high-yielding, low-maintenance, and low-cost school gardens. 

This allows students to eat tons of fresh fruit, while freeing teachers and garden coordinators to focus on education instead of maintenance.



In addition to growing the number of schools we reach, we’re setting our sights on deeper interactions with each site and its students. Your funds will go towards developing school curriculum, launching dozens of easily adopted orchard activities, expanding the orchards to include understory gardening and perennial vegetables, and even to build outdoor kitchens among the trees.

<p>A follow-up course for women (aged 17-32), primarily graduates from my prep course in 2011, to upgrade their communications skills in English,  to study women affairs as well as to enhance their status and their potential roles in the local society.</p>
<p><strong>What is the project?</strong></p>
<p>To raise $35,000 to continue the advanced level training of a class of 35 Afghani women, i.e. to run a 2-month follow-up course in Pul-e Khumri, Afghanistan for students who completed my prep course in 2011 as well as to continue the basic level English language training of approx. 100 local women.</p>
<p>Depending on the total amount raised in this campaign, the duration of the training will be adjusted, hopefully it will be increased in one-month increments. Contributions amounting to US$10,000 in excess of the target amount would facilitate the extension of the course by approx. 1 month.</p>
<p>Any amount raised in this campaign, no matter how large, or small, will be utilized towards the training of this class of young ladies.</p>
<p>Last year I implemented a prep course for a group of 35 young ladies utilizing a generous grant from the US State Department and I prepared the graduates for participation in my Afghani women empowerment course.</p>
<p>Students consolidated their English language skills and we laid a solid basis for their advanced studies. Now is the time to launch their follow-up course.</p>
<p>Approx 50 % of the donations are for the cost of the teacher, including safe transport and accommodation, the cost of the local NGO partner, and 50  % for logistic and IT support, security and maintenance, the operation of the school building, including electricity, internet subscription and fuel in the winter (depending on the timing of the course).</p>
<p>I and the students will send you a personal email plus updates incl. photos about daily life around the school and in the streets of scenic Pul-e-Khumri. We will also place your name in the donor list on the wall of our classroom</p>
<p>We will have all sorts of goodies, genuine Afghani products from the local arts and crafts market, in store for everyone who makes a larger contribution.</p>
<p><strong>Who are we?</strong></p>
<p>My name is Sandor Mesterhazy, I am a teacher and interpreter. I am Hungarian and I live in a small town near Budapest.</p>
<p>I have visited Afghanistan several times since 2004. I escorted VIPs as a freelance interpreter and I worked there as a teacher under two different government contracts. I developed two tailor-made training methodologies for Afghani students. I implemented my interpreter training course for a large group of Afghani men in 2008 / 2009 and one of the graduates from that course is my teaching assistant (TA) now. I designed an Afghan women training methodology, which I field-tested and verified over the past few years.</p>
<p>Students from my 2011 prep course in Pul-e Khumri would attend the envisaged “intercultural communications course for women”, which will be financed from your generous contributions now.</p>
<p>Students are local Pul-e Khumri residents, some of them graduated from high school last year and some of them have a college diploma. One student is a young mother who attended classes with her baby girl in her arms. She turned out to be one of the hardest working and most successful students in the course. Students accepted considerable risks in the current situation when they enrolled in a course strictly designed for local women. We managed to build good relations with leading members of the local community and we encountered no objections to the education of women in Pul-e Khumri.</p>
<p>My TA is an accomplished local Afghani teacher and interpreter.</p>
<p>My local NGO partner is the Social Support for Women and Children Organization (SISWC), which was established in June 2008 as a non-profit, non-governmental, non-political organization. SISWC has operated in different locations in Baghlan Province in the implementation of training courses. SISWC has worked in close cooperation with a range of local Afghani and foreign implementing partners. SISWC has given each project a unique “Afghan face” and facilitated the acceptance of a women empowerment projects in local communities.</p>
<p><strong>Where is it?</strong></p>
<p>Pul-e Khumri is the capital of Baghlan Province in northern Afghanistan. The school is situated on an abandoned industrial site along the main road to Kabul. Unfortunately, the building and the whole site are in a sadly dilapidated condition, which is not considered to be unique in a country that was ravaged by 35 years of foreign occupation, civil war and the ongoing war on terror.</p>
<p><strong>Why this project?</strong></p>
<p>I and my Afghani NGO partner selected a group of young ladies whose English language proficiency was good enough to enroll in a course that prepared them for advanced studies in English language communications and in women affairs.</p>
<p>The course won the hearts and minds of students and members of the local community alike. These young ladies, graduates from the prep course are very well prepared to take advantage of the envisaged inter-cultural communications course, to find a good job and to pursue a professional career in the future.</p>
<p>It would be a waste of our efforts and funds that were invested in the prep course, if the training did not continue. I escorted my students half way towards a better future and it would be a grave mistake to abandon them now. We made them believe that education would pave their way towards a better future. I want to go with them all the way to that objective.</p>
<p>I request you to fund this project to make the students' dreams of a better future come true.</p>
<p><strong>Why now?</strong></p>
<p>The situation in this region of Afghanistan is still relatively peaceful and the education of women is still possible. The training of these young ladies should resume and their studies should be completed as long as the prevailing circumstances permit it.</p>
<p>We are in a hurry, since the withdrawal of US and ISAF troops in 2014 is drawing near and no one can predict how long this window of opportunity remains open to us.</p>
<p>I decided not to wait for a new government grant, I decided to promote and safeguard my students’ interests and raise the necessary amount of funds for the continuation of their studies as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Why us?</strong></p>
<p>No other similar training opportunity has been available to local women in Baghlan Province. It was my initiative to launch the prep course, I designed the training methodology and I secured funding for this class of young ladies. I and my local partner NGO pooled our efforts to launch this course and unless we sustain the momentum of this project, no other advanced training opportunity in English will be available to local women.</p>
<p>We have an outstanding track record in the local community, we won the hearts and minds of a lot of local people. We can continue the training of women in the same school and in the course, but it is highly unlikely that in the less and less tolerant atmosphere anyone else could start any new training program.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Important notice : </span></p>
<p>Much to my regret, cultural and religious reasons as well as safety considerations prevent me from enclosing at least some of the very few photos that I took of my students in class and in the graduation ceremony.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I will attach a series of photos of the neighborhood, the industrial site where the shoo-an-zay (Pashto for school) is situated and the school building itself. Also, I enclosed te photo of a beautiful Afghani war rug.</p>
<p>Please find enclosed a few photos of the dilapidated building and our classroom, which may seem to be a pretty awful place by western standards, but which were perfect for our purposes, while we were conducting our daily classes there together in a warm and friendly atmosphere for several months.</p>

Unfortunately, the building and the whole site are in a sadly dilapidated condition, which is not considered to be unique in a country that was ravaged by 35 years of foreign occupation, civil war and the ongoing war on terror.
Why this project?
I and my Afghani NGO partner selected a group of young ladies whose English language proficiency was good enough to enroll in a course that prepared them for advanced studies in English language communications and in women affairs.
The course won the hearts and minds of students and members of the local community alike. These young ladies, graduates from the prep course are very well prepared to take advantage of the envisaged inter-cultural communications course, to find a good job and to pursue a professional career in the future.
It would be a waste of our efforts and funds that were invested in the prep course, if the training did not continue. I escorted my students half way towards a better future and it would be a grave mistake to abandon them now. We made them believe that education would pave their way towards a better future. I want to go with them all the way to that objective.
I request you to fund this project to make the students' dreams of a better future come true.
Why now?
The situation in this region of Afghanistan is still relatively peaceful and the education of women is still possible. The training of these young ladies should resume and their studies should be completed as long as the prevailing circumstances permit it.
We are in a hurry, since the withdrawal of US and ISAF troops in 2014 is drawing near and no one can predict how long this window of opportunity remains open to us.
I decided not to wait for a new government grant, I decided to promote and safeguard my students’ interests and raise the necessary amount of funds for the continuation of their studies as soon as possible.
Why us?
No other similar training opportunity has been available to local women in Baghlan Province. It was my initiative to launch the prep course, I designed the training methodology and I secured funding for this class of young ladies. I and my local partner NGO pooled our efforts to launch this course and unless we sustain the momentum of this project, no other advanced training opportunity in English will be available to local women.
We have an outstanding track record in the local community, we won the hearts and minds of a lot of local people. We can continue the training of women in the same school and in the course, but it is highly unlikely that in the less and less tolerant atmosphere anyone else could start any new training program.
Important notice : 
Much to my regret, cultural and religious reasons as well as safety considerations prevent me from enclosing at least some of the very few photos that I took of my students in class and in the graduation ceremony.
Nevertheless, I will attach a series of photos of the neighborhood, the industrial site where the shoo-an-zay (Pashto for school) is situated and the school building itself. Also, I enclosed te photo of a beautiful Afghani war rug.
Please find enclosed a few photos of the dilapidated building and our classroom, which may seem to be a pretty awful place by western standards, but which were perfect for our purposes, while we were conducting our daily classes there together in a warm and friendly atmosphere for several months.

<h3><strong>Short Summary</strong></h3>
<p>My name is Luna and I am a Senior at High Tech High Media Arts (HTHMA) in San Diego, CA. At HTHMA, we have a program called One World Week, a weeklong period for students in 9th-12th grade to experience the world around them outside of the classroom.</p>
<p>This year, 14 of my peers and I are trying to go to Bali and Singapore to learn volunteer at a local school, and learn about these cultures first-hand. Unfortunately, with more than half of us coming from low-income backgrounds, we do not have the funds to get there alone. With your help, 15 students will be able to experience the Balinese culture first hand. </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>In order to make this trip happen, we need to raise at least $34,000. Even if we are unable to raise this much money, every little bit will help us to achieve our goal. No donations will be wasted! </p>

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>My name is Baruch Inbar. I am an artist and a filmmaker, from Los Angeles. I wanted to share with you a unique project I’ve been working on, called <a href=""http://www.BlessTheChildrenProject.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>BLESS THE CHILDREN</strong></a>.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.BlessTheChildrenProject.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>BLESS THE CHILDREN</strong></a> is a documentary and worldwide campaign, about educating and empowering children of the incredible health benefits of plant based foods. A significant part of this film will be dedicated to reaching out and bringing this information, along with the resources and tools to less fortunate kids such as foster kids and orphans.</p>
<p>The film will clearly demonstrate the health impact of plant based living foods on the well being of children and their emotional, academic, intellectual and athletic performances. It will be scientifically backed by massive research, and by a panel of world leading experts, M.D's and scientists.</p>
<p>Our most important goal with this film, is to inspire both adults and children about this incredible way of life, and it's positive impact on our planet and society for the long run.</p>
<p>I was raised as a foster child in southern Israel from the age of 10 to 19, after spending nearly two years in the streets. The pain of being a foster child is very close to my heart, and I am intimately familiar with these children’s pain.</p>
<p>The challenging times I went through, which included hunger and neglect, left within me deep emotional and physical wounds. From a very young age I suffered from various medical conditions including: Asthma, allergies and heartburns. I was on many medications for over 20 years. Some of these medications were severely compromising the quality of my life and my well being.</p>
<p>After going through my own personal healing journey in 2009, experiencing the incredible benefits of this life sustaining nutrition, I realized how critical it is for the well being of all of us, and particularely our children.</p>
<p>Since then, I made a commitment to use my experience and personal journey of healing, to educate and inspire children and provide them with the information and knowledge that will give them the power and access to make healthy choices and create for themselves a bright future.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We need $60,000 to shoot this documentary in HD for a period of 6-8 weeks working with both Jewish and Arab children, in Israel and Palestine. The budget will cover our trip expenses to Israel and Palestine, film crew and editing budget. If we get more funding, we can incorporate into the film lots of cool post-production and animated sequences.    </p>
<p>By supporting us you will not only going to have an important role in the creation of this important project, but you will be also rewarded. Among our rewards, we are going to give away the BLESS THE CHILDREN chocolates, which are made by us, our friends, and their children.</p>
<p>See some yummy pics here: <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/9mt88bz"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>CHOCOLATE PICS</strong></a></p>
<p>We will also giveaway t-shirts, signed DVD’s, VIP invite to screenings in LA and after parties and much more!</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>The health statistics of children are staggering. Over 25% of kids in the US are obese and sick, and many of them are on some form of medications. Many teenagers are also on anti-depressants that severely impact their emotional and mental capacities.</p>
<p>So, my goal in this film is not only to address the nutritional educational campaign for foster children, but to actually to use the film as an educational model that will serve all children and adults wherever they are. The film will guide through the process and steps of implementing plant based living foods into one’s lifestyle, and will share success stories of those who went through that path.</p>
<p>Numerous publications, studies, books and films were published about the importance and benefits of plant based living foods into our daily lives. In fact, many well-known scientists including M.D’s, are prominent speakers of the importance of this powerful nutrition. It can literally save one’s life.</p>
<p>In this documentary, I intend to reach out to as many children as possible and share with them this precious information, teaching them how to make incredibly delicious foods and the principals of this wisdom that will guide them for life.</p>
<p>Children are our future and their most valuable asset is their health. If we invest in our children, we invest in our future.</p>

<p>As I sit writing this, it hits me that I am actually in South Africa and have been here for about 2 months. I am currently studying abroad for the fall semester of my senior year in Cape Town, South Africa with a program called CIEE Service-Learning. Normally you would find me studying Math at The University of Texas at Austin, but this semester I decided to branch out, study something completely different, and go a step further by incorporating that education into a life changing project. The program I am in is structured so that along with my school work I am also partnering with an organization in the community to help them in any way I see possible.</p>
<h2>The Need</h2>
<p>I have been spending the past 2 months with an organization called Yabonga, which is an NGO that supports women, men, and children who are infected or directly affected by HIV/Aids in Cape Town. Through this organization, every week I go out to the township of Samora Machel to love, support, and encourage about 20 wonderful youth, ages 14-18, that live in the neighborhood. As they walk into the small portable building where the youth center is locate in their school uniforms, most of which are torn from wear and tear, I cannot wait to see what they teach me that day. Their bright smiling faces, despite what they go through everyday, never cease to amaze me. The despair of gangsterism, poverty, hungry, and/or HIV/Aids has not stopped these youth from pursing their dreams, and they continue to fight.</p>
<p>Having seen over the past weeks while living and learning in Cape Town that many youth are not getting the education they deserve, it was impossible to ignore this and leave here in 2 months without supporting the youth that I have gotten to know and love. The standards and quality of education here are so low that it is beyond reason and once the students leave their school building, they often have no resources or support in their studies, which is basically a requirement if you even have a chance of passing for graduation. </p>
<h2>Project Goal</h2>
<p>Given my background in math, my goal during this time in Samora Machel and other townships is to develop a system and provide materials in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) fields for the youth there to be able to continue their education outside of school and essentially be able to teach themselves when no one else is there. Most of the youth that I have met in recent days are studying subjects that align with the STEM fields, which has been incredible to hear. </p>
<p>Tangibly, I am seeking to raise funds to support this project of continuing STEM Education in the townships of South Africa. With the funds I raise, I will be purchasing supplies, such as notebooks, pencils, rulers, calculators, etc. and supplying each youth center with several copies of their school textbooks and/or workbooks. In addition to giving each youth center in the townships, of which there are 10, all of the supplies they need, I hope to also purchase bookshelves for storage. These shelves will be painted with helpful math tips and charts so that when studying the youth are surrounded by resources that encourage them to continue their studies.</p>
<p>I can only hope that this small project will leave an impact that will make a big different in the lives of the youth here in South Africa. I see so much potential in every single one of them, if only they had the support they needed to succeed in their education then they would be able to fulfill their dreams, rise up out of poverty, and change the world for good. As I met with Desmond Tutu this past week, he continually reminded me that ""the youth are the best hope the world has for change."" I could not agree more. </p>

<div class=""col"">
<p>Ethics and good governance are crucial elements for ensuring proper functioning of a democracy, and are at the heart of public concerns in Canadian society.  In 1977, the new Act Respecting the Financing of Political Parties was adopted unanimously; proof of the will of elected officials to equip themselves with standards that favour public integrity.  In the last years, many public scandals have been revealed, causing public opinion to react, demanding transparency, honesty and integrity from public representatives.  The recent implementation of the Municipal Ethics and Good Conduct Act, which calls on municipal governments to adopt codes of ethics, is a testament to the importance of these issues.</p>
<p>The IGO Certifications Program is an attempt to support and develop this evolution toward equipping our public officials with the best possible tools with which to govern.  By offering a certificate for good governance practices in municipalities, we are introducing a novel idea in the spirit of the current political climate.  This is the missing link that will allow citizens and their elected officials to rekindle trust in their relationship.</p>
<p>This certification protocol is the fruit of many years of observation of evolution in the field of public administration.  By juxtaposing the already existing standards of large international organizations with known criteria from scientific literature, it will allow for the implementation of the most complete and <em>avant-garde </em>good governance program to this day.  Moreover, I’d like to mention the involvement of reputable experts in the development of this program.  I recognize the exceptional contribution of the members of our Scientific Council, who are seeking to bridge the gap between the academic world and the needs of Canadian society.</p>
</div>
<div class=""col"">
<p>In this spirit, a pilot project was carried out in the City of Blainville. Now that this project is completed – the City has committed to implementing nearly all of the reforms leading to certification by the end of 2012 – the IGO Certification Program is now available to all municipalities in Québec that wish to make a concrete commitment toward good governance practices.  Beyond IGO full certification, the IGO Program is now also available in “Bronze” or “Silver” level attestations, progressively leading to full IGO certification. In this way, different avenues for improvement, all signaling strong commitment in favour of good governance, are available and accessible to all municipalities in Canada.</p>
<p>Without further ado, I would like to invite you to take part in this movement and to contribute to rebuilding trust between elected officials and citizens, as well as to help to reestablish the true meaning of democracy.</p>

</div></div>","Ethics and good governance are crucial elements for ensuring proper functioning of a democracy, and are at the heart of public concerns in Canadian society.  In 1977, the new Act Respecting the Financing of Political Parties was adopted unanimously; proof of the will of elected officials to equip themselves with standards that favour public integrity.  In the last years, many public scandals have been revealed, causing public opinion to react, demanding transparency, honesty and integrity from public representatives.  The recent implementation of the Municipal Ethics and Good Conduct Act, which calls on municipal governments to adopt codes of ethics, is a testament to the importance of these issues.
The IGO Certifications Program is an attempt to support and develop this evolution toward equipping our public officials with the best possible tools with which to govern.  By offering a certificate for good governance practices in municipalities, we are introducing a novel idea in the spirit of the current political climate.  This is the missing link that will allow citizens and their elected officials to rekindle trust in their relationship.
This certification protocol is the fruit of many years of observation of evolution in the field of public administration.  By juxtaposing the already existing standards of large international organizations with known criteria from scientific literature, it will allow for the implementation of the most complete and avant-garde good governance program to this day.  Moreover, I’d like to mention the involvement of reputable experts in the development of this program.  I recognize the exceptional contribution of the members of our Scientific Council, who are seeking to bridge the gap between the academic world and the needs of Canadian society.


In this spirit, a pilot project was carried out in the City of Blainville. Now that this project is completed – the City has committed to implementing nearly all of the reforms leading to certification by the end of 2012 – the IGO Certification Program is now available to all municipalities in Québec that wish to make a concrete commitment toward good governance practices.  Beyond IGO full certification, the IGO Program is now also available in “Bronze” or “Silver” level attestations, progressively leading to full IGO certification. In this way, different avenues for improvement, all signaling strong commitment in favour of good governance, are available and accessible to all municipalities in Canada.
Without further ado, I would like to invite you to take part in this movement and to contribute to rebuilding trust between elected officials and citizens, as well as to help to reestablish the true meaning of democracy.
Christian Bordeleau, PhDc., President and Founder of the IGO Good Governance Certifications Program

<h3>About me and the Program:</h3>
<p>I have been conducting Recreation Therapy for the past 15 years.  My passion for it resulted in a Masters Degree (2003) and a national certification (Since 1999).  The importance I have for treating challenges in childhood has resulted in 9 years of helping kids overcome problems for a succesful adulthood.</p>
<p>I have a lifetime of experience and involvement in theater, including a Bachlor of Fine Arts in performance degree (1996) and many other expressive related training over the years.</p>
<p>The program was inspired by parents trying to find a social skills program.  Using both my therapy profession and expressive/theatrical background would become the effective receipe for treating social needs of kids who have trouble reading expressions, interpreting body language, understanding social cues, managing emotions and becoming comfortable in social situations.    </p>
<h3><strong>About the Mission</strong></h3>
<p>We know how central interacting is and often take the basic skills we have for it for granted. What if you couldn't socialize well? What if everything about socializing was like a foreign language to you? Consider the vitalness of communicating; Employment, relationships, getting needs met.  Imagine the deteriorating effects not being able to communicate well has on a developing child and on the quality of their life in the years to come.</p>
<p>Kids with Autistic Spectrum Disorders, such as Aspergers Syndrome Disorder, get services that address interaction behaviors.  But <strong>consider how extremely rare</strong> it is to have a program that centers itself completely on social skills development, with an instructor equipped with a lifelong experience in the theatre, and instilled with many years of therapy-related experience and education to use.   </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Needs:</h3>
<p>We are in dire need of start up costs associated with treatment service supplies, equipment, stage platform construction, puppetering materials, and all other needed materials involved in the actual service delivery.</p>
<p>We also need funds the cover rental space.  In the event that enough money is collected it can go to families who can not afford to place their child in the program.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The plea:</h3>
<p>This unique opportunity is a special service that is ideal for children dealing with symptoms associated with Autism Spectrum Disorders.  This program needs to have a life in order to be available.  Please contribute what you can.  A fund large or small we need them all.  Make certain that this service is a reality for kids who wish things like having friends, not being bullied, having more confidence and knowing social language. </p>

I own my own graphic design firm and spent time this past summer volunteering for the Safe House of Hope in Baltimore, Maryland.  As part of our SHOH’s outreach I was introduced to a Roma family and immediately was drawn to them and their tragic circumstances trying to survive the streets of Baltimore by begging on the streets.  As I got to know them better I fell in love with these beautiful people.  Roma’s are often referred to as Gypsies and as an ethnic class have faced severe persecution in Europe and elsewhere around the world.  </p><p>This culture has been denied education and acceptance into the community throughout Romania and Europe.  Sadly, this has led to a large group of poorly educated and trained people who are forced to do desperate things to simply survive. </p><p>This group fled severe persecution, discrimination and poverty in Romania hoping for better life in Italy.  Once there, it was only marginally better than in Romania.  They repeatedly had their temporary housing torn down. The family’s last camp was burnt down by the police with gasoline while people were still inside their homes. After losing friends in the fire the group decided to flee to America. </p><p>My Roma friends currently live in a house together in a Baltimore neighborhood that is considered one of the most dangerous in the city.  There are 3 mothers and 7 kids that have struggled to survive by begging and doing whatever they could to raise money for the “family”.  The kids range in age from 2 to 16 years old.</p><p>Our biggest accomplishment was 2 weeks ago when the little ones started school for the first time. This was monumental especially for the 8 &amp; 9 year olds. If these children were in still in Romania or in Europe, this opportunity would have been very difficult traveling from camp to camp. It still is very difficult culturally and economically having a stable environment to maintain a routine. Unfortunately the teenage girls don't have the luxury of school yet, because they are still responsible to raise money for food &amp; rent. </p><p>The families are starting the asylum process with Catholic Charities. Within this group Alina Constantin and her two children, Grifina and Antonio, are furthest along. Their asylum hearing is scheduled for April 2014.  During this period of time, they are not allowed to beg on the street for money, which again is how they have survived to this point.  Once they receive asylum, they will be allowed to legally work, which will help further break the challenges and cycle of severe poverty.</p><p>Now we are at the point where the family needs to figure out how to get from today through April 2014, when we feel they will receive asylum and be able to work legally, be self sufficient and flourish with education.  Here is where you can help.  Any donations we receive will be used to pay for rent and food to get this group through April.</p><p>Thank you for any help!</p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><h3>The Kids</h3>Here are my buddies who remind me to be grateful, who grab my hand to pray over a slice of pizza, who always smile and laugh despite the fact they slept on floor boards the night before….<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Alexc, age 6<span><br/></span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/217209/files/20131122155642-alex-starting_school.jpg?1385164602"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em; width: 217.5px; height: 290px;""/></p><p>Antonio, age 8<span><br/></span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/198401/files/20131114183722-IMG_4772_copy_2.jpg?1384483042"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em;""/></p><p>Deborah, age 9<span><br/></span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/198403/files/20131114183749-IMG_4709_copy.jpg?1384483069"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em;""/></p><p>Govani, age 6, Deliah, age 2 (&amp; Alexc)<span><br/></span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/217214/files/20131122155920-govani.jpg?1385164760"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em; width: 293.01310043668127px; height: 220px;""/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Grifina, age 16, on the day she interned with me at<span><br/></span></span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The Baltimore Leadership School for Young Women</span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/198373/files/20131114182606-BLSYW-2_copy.jpg?1384482366"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em; width: 296px; height: 296px;""/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need</h3><p></p>
<p>Here are our
goals:</p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>Provide $1000
towards rent &amp; food each month for the 3 families struggling together until asylum in spring. </p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3><p></p>
<p>Helping this
family goes beyond providing rent. Here is why the stability of shelter is so
important: </p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>This allows the younger kids who have for the first time just started school stay and
flourish. Another year lost especially for the 8 &amp; 9 year old would be
devastating during these critical years. </p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>This lifts the
weight off the shoulders of the teenage girls to help make rent and allows them to
be free to further their education. </p>
<p>•<span>

I own my own graphic design firm and spent time this past summer volunteering for the Safe House of Hope in Baltimore, Maryland.  As part of our SHOH’s outreach I was introduced to a Roma family and immediately was drawn to them and their tragic circumstances trying to survive the streets of Baltimore by begging on the streets.  As I got to know them better I fell in love with these beautiful people.  Roma’s are often referred to as Gypsies and as an ethnic class have faced severe persecution in Europe and elsewhere around the world.  This culture has been denied education and acceptance into the community throughout Romania and Europe.  Sadly, this has led to a large group of poorly educated and trained people who are forced to do desperate things to simply survive. This group fled severe persecution, discrimination and poverty in Romania hoping for better life in Italy.  Once there, it was only marginally better than in Romania.  They repeatedly had their temporary housing torn down. The family’s last camp was burnt down by the police with gasoline while people were still inside their homes. After losing friends in the fire the group decided to flee to America. My Roma friends currently live in a house together in a Baltimore neighborhood that is considered one of the most dangerous in the city.  There are 3 mothers and 7 kids that have struggled to survive by begging and doing whatever they could to raise money for the “family”.  The kids range in age from 2 to 16 years old.Our biggest accomplishment was 2 weeks ago when the little ones started school for the first time. This was monumental especially for the 8 & 9 year olds. If these children were in still in Romania or in Europe, this opportunity would have been very difficult traveling from camp to camp. It still is very difficult culturally and economically having a stable environment to maintain a routine. Unfortunately the teenage girls don't have the luxury of school yet, because they are still responsible to raise money for food & rent. The families are starting the asylum process with Catholic Charities. Within this group Alina Constantin and her two children, Grifina and Antonio, are furthest along. Their asylum hearing is scheduled for April 2014.  During this period of time, they are not allowed to beg on the street for money, which again is how they have survived to this point.  Once they receive asylum, they will be allowed to legally work, which will help further break the challenges and cycle of severe poverty.Now we are at the point where the family needs to figure out how to get from today through April 2014, when we feel they will receive asylum and be able to work legally, be self sufficient and flourish with education.  Here is where you can help.  Any donations we receive will be used to pay for rent and food to get this group through April.Thank you for any help!The KidsHere are my buddies who remind me to be grateful, who grab my hand to pray over a slice of pizza, who always smile and laugh despite the fact they slept on floor boards the night before….Alexc, age 6Antonio, age 8Deborah, age 9Govani, age 6, Deliah, age 2 (& Alexc)Grifina, age 16, on the day she interned with me atThe Baltimore Leadership School for Young WomenWhat We Need
Here are our
goals:
• 
Provide $1000
towards rent & food each month for the 3 families struggling together until asylum in spring. 
The Impact
Helping this
family goes beyond providing rent. Here is why the stability of shelter is so
important: 
• 
This allows the younger kids who have for the first time just started school stay and
flourish. Another year lost especially for the 8 & 9 year old would be
devastating during these critical years. 
• 
This lifts the
weight off the shoulders of the teenage girls to help make rent and allows them to
be free to further their education. 
• 
On a global
level education is the solution to lifting the Roma up out of poverty and
ending the discrimination. Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can't contribute that doesn’t mean you can’t help:

<p>Number Rumbler is a brain-fizzing, fun
game for families - anyone from 6 to adult can join in. When you play it you'll be having fun, practising your times tables, and developing number sense - all at the same time.<br/></p>
<p>Number Rumbler was developed by
family maths charity Maths on Toast. We're really proud of Number Rumbler
and we want to get more people playing it! Thing is, to charge anything like a
reasonable price, we need to print thousands of packs. By buying a pack in advance, you'll not only get your own copy, you'll help us get Number
Rumbler to everyone! <br/></p><p></p><h3>What's Number Sense and how does Number Rumbler help?</h3><p>Number sense is what it sounds like: a sense for numbers. Learning
multiplication tables is all about number facts: 2 x 5 is 10, for example.
Number sense is deeper, more fun and more valuable. It's about understanding
how numbers relate to each other more broadly.<br/></p><p>Number Rumbler consists of a pack of cards with numbers written - and drawn - in different ways. For example, 12 could be 4+4+4 or 3x4 or drawn out as twelve dots. By playing with the cards, you'll get a better sense of how the numbers relate to one another - and because of that understanding, you'll be more flexible with numbers and more fluent when you're calculating and estimating. <br/></p><h3></h3><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439116085/umfsdtsrebyvqgrgfvjs.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h3><b>How to Play</b></h3><p></p>
<p>You can play noisy or quiet games
with Number Rumbler - it's up to you. A great way to start is simply to sort the cards into families - all the 12s, all the 10s, and so on. You might also want to take out some of the cards if you're playing with younger children - the blue division cards, and the green cards with words on. <br/></p><p>Then you can get on to more advanced Number Rumbler games! <br/></p>

<p>“Making maths fun for children........that certainly happened at
The Winch during this project! It is a fantastic idea and has opened the door
to children who, not only like maths, but also those who find it challenging.
Maths on Toast has been a great organisation to partner with, if you’re interested
in making maths fun for children, please support their crowdfunding campaign!” Kim Mabbutt, Play Development Officer, The Winch<i><br/></i></p>

the world needs is more numbers. And it<br/>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need £7000. That's based on a print run, a trademark, and
the postage to get all those cards to you. You have a choice of many rewards!  For increasing amounts, you can have a
pack of Number Rumbler, a badge to wear when you win, a meetup with Alison Clark-Wilson to learn about Number Sense ... all the way to your own personalised
pack or dinner and a game with celebrated mathematician Hannah Fry. Feeling political? We'll send
some cards to the Education Select Committee for you. Or maybe you're feeling
philanthropic! If so you can send a set of cards to a local school.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There are two
reasons this game is important. First of all, it makes playing with numbers
into a fun family game, with obvious educational benefits. <br/>
<br/>
It's also important for our organisation, Maths on Toast. We are a tiny
charity, started very recently, that's here to make maths family fun. All
profits from the cards go back into helping us make more fun family maths
resources. So even beyond our target, the more you pledge, the more we'll be
able to do to make maths family and community fun. In fact, we believe that if we can get this initial funding, then we'll be able to sell many more packs of Number Rumbler  - and it will generate income that makes our organisation sustainable long-term. That means more fun, family maths activities for everyone.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>Some More Backstory</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>We developed this game by working with real children and
parents in the London Borough of Camden. Thanks to their input, this game is
much better than it would have been otherwise. So thanks are due to the team at
the Winch and at Pancras Square Library - and also to John Lyon's Charity for
funding the early development of the game.</p>

<p>The design may improve as a result of feedback during the

would be a nice problem to have.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>The maths of crowdfunding is crazy. One in twenty people who
see this page will pledge - though the average is apparently a generous £50.
That means we need to reach over 3000 people to achieve our goal. We're small and
new and we don't have that many friends yet. Please share! The best way to do
that is to post a link on Facebook, or send an email with a link to a couple of
friends you think might be interested. Thank you :)</p>

</div> </div>","Introducing... Number Rumbler!
Number Rumbler is a brain-fizzing, fun
game for families - anyone from 6 to adult can join in. When you play it you'll be having fun, practising your times tables, and developing number sense - all at the same time.
Number Rumbler was developed by
family maths charity Maths on Toast. We're really proud of Number Rumbler
and we want to get more people playing it! Thing is, to charge anything like a
reasonable price, we need to print thousands of packs. By buying a pack in advance, you'll not only get your own copy, you'll help us get Number
Rumbler to everyone! What's Number Sense and how does Number Rumbler help?Number sense is what it sounds like: a sense for numbers. Learning
multiplication tables is all about number facts: 2 x 5 is 10, for example.
Number sense is deeper, more fun and more valuable. It's about understanding
how numbers relate to each other more broadly.Number Rumbler consists of a pack of cards with numbers written - and drawn - in different ways. For example, 12 could be 4+4+4 or 3x4 or drawn out as twelve dots. By playing with the cards, you'll get a better sense of how the numbers relate to one another - and because of that understanding, you'll be more flexible with numbers and more fluent when you're calculating and estimating. How to Play
You can play noisy or quiet games
with Number Rumbler - it's up to you. A great way to start is simply to sort the cards into families - all the 12s, all the 10s, and so on. You might also want to take out some of the cards if you're playing with younger children - the blue division cards, and the green cards with words on. Then you can get on to more advanced Number Rumbler games!
