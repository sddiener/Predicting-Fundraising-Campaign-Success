</p><h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Annee came to be a part of our family in 2006.  She is an amazing Bernise Mountain dog who loves everyone!  If you've met Annee, you are blessed for having done so.</p>
<p>
</p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Annee underwent surgery for anal gland surgery that had spread to her lymphatic system.  The surgery lasted over five hours.  It was very extensive.  She is doing fairly well today - not out of the woods - but we are hopeful of her recovery.  </p>
<p>After she recovers, she will have several chemotherapy treatments three weeks apart.  This will likely extend her life - barring any complications - by several months, perhaps years.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, all of this is very expensive.  Andrea is a single ""parent"" who works very hard to provide a loving and warm home for her beloved Annee.  Andrea does not know I am asking on her behalf, but if you could spare a small contribution to Annee's Healing Fund, I know she would be so very grateful.</p>
<p>I hope you know that I would love to give you a ""gift"" for your ""gift"" but everything is going toward this special Healing Fund.  If Annee could, she would call you and thank you - so THANK YOU!  </p>
<p>
</p><h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact of your contribution would be amazing.  Perhaps your contribution is simply forwarding this request on to others you know who are acquainted with Andrea and Annee.  I don't know all their ""friends"" but perhaps you know one or more who might want to help.  </p>

<b>Help HIV patients who are resistant to current treatments.</b><br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p><b> </b>Despite the great progress made in
HIV/AIDS treatment, there is still an urgent need for new drugs, particularly
for people who have had to abandon existing treatments due to HIV drug
resistance and side effects. Our new potential therapy, based on a natural resistance molecule we discovered, will be effective to inhibit HIV infection including those that have become resistant to current drugs. Our treatment could extend the lives of many thousands; however, more work is needed before it becomes a successful drug candidate and attracts investment for clinical trials. <strong>We need $300,000. Our goal is to raise $75,000 matching funds to secure government grants to achieve this target</strong>.</p>
<p><b>Is the HIV/AIDS crisis over?</b></p>
<p>Significant
progress has been made in the fight against HIV/AIDS, advances in treatment
prolong lives of most patients that have access to anti HIV drugs, however many
challenges remain, the HIV/AIDS pandemic is far from over.</p>
<p>More than 35
million people live with HIV/AIDS,  there
are over 2 million new infections every year and 1.8 million people die, more
than half are women and children.</p>
<p><b>Why is there a need for new therapies
for HIV/AIDS?</b></p>
<p>There is no
effective vaccine (all trials failed) or cure on the horizon. Although more
than thirty drugs control most HIV infections for a period of time, nearly all of
them eventually stop working due to resistance. </p>
<p>Today, up to
20 % of new HIV infections show increasing resistance to existing drugs and up
to 60 % develop resistance during long-term treatment. We expect drug
resistance will increase even more in the future.</p>

underserved communities, full-time Coordinators teach daily classroom lessons,
organize and facilitate after school programming, provide staff and parent
outreach, and hold school/community-wide events. With HCU, staff and students
from schools and organizations across the nation are trained to deliver
HealthCorps’ innovative curriculum in their particular setting. HealthCorps’
approach is unique because it focuses on whole person and total community
wellness, and is tailored to fit the needs of any school or organization. This
program is especially important these days as education funding cuts are ever
increasing and affecting the quality of instruction students receive. I want to
help this cause to ensure that kids and communities in DC and across the country
can access the resources they need that would allow them to become healthy
adults, and possibly athletes the way I was able to.</p>
<p>My goal is to raise at least $2500 for this race, the first $300

a Washington D.C. public high school. Every donation, no matter how small, will
make a difference.</p>

<h3>We Believe Cats Make People Happier</h3>
<p>Everything we do, we believe in making the world a <i>meower</i> place because cats make people happier. The way we do this is by making a Spa beautifully designed for both humans and cats. We just happen to heal humans by fostering stray kittens in a Spa.</p>
<p>We are an entrepreneurial couple that experienced a difficult time in our lives. We did however, feel a remarkable improvement when we rescued a couple of street cats who became part of our family. We then collaborated with local animal shelters to foster stray kittens at home and realised two things: </p>
<ul>
<li>There are a lot of kittens needing a home.</li>
<li>People feel good spending time with kittens.</li>
</ul>
<div><h3>Can we make the world a better place for humans and cats at the same time?</h3></div>
<p>The stress of fast paced urban living, away from what is natural, has a major impact on our wellbeing and stray kittens are keeping the shelters at their maximum capacity, leaving animals on the streets. Spaws is a disruptive idea that solves this problem by fostering stray kittens in a Spa, so that two species can help each other.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To make this happen we estimate that $150,000 will cover starting costs for a great location in Sydney's CBD including the refurbishment of the venue, veterinary expenses, food etc. We need your support to reach our goal and for that we have created exciting perks that will contribute to the funding of this campaign. However, Indiegogo will only give us the funds if we reach our target in full. If we don't, all money collected will be returned to every donor.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The world's first kitten Spa will have a positive impact on the wellbeing of human visitors who will release oxytocin thanks to stray kittens that would otherwise be left on the streets.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This project has never been done before and we will face some hurdles. Our background in Project Management, Hospitality, Marketing and Business will help, but our determination and passion to improve the lives of people and cats, will ensure we overcome all hurdles. </p>

<p>In 1957, Jim Morrison, frontman of the rock

that the bench was built in 1920, long before Morrison was born. An old friend of Morrison's, Timothy Malone, confirms that Jim <b>did<i> </i></b>hang out at the bench, however. (The
""dumb friends"" is a reference to animals who, of course, don't speak.
Isabelle Clark was an early supporter of animal rights.)</p>
<p>When the bench was damaged by a falling palm

</div></div>","What is Conquer Self Lifestyle?
Conquer Self is a lifestyle clothing brand for those who rise above, wishing to better themselves in body, mind and spirit.
 We all fall, we all fail. But those of us who get back up and never give up are the ones who conquer self.
Whether it's losing weight or becoming healthier. Facing a fear or learning something new, and challenging the mind. Even going beyond the mind and becoming more conscious and aware. None of it can happen without you conquering yourself, your insecurities, your demons, your fears. It's about letting go. The Conquer Self  Lifestyle is about taking action and not giving up - as well as living life to the fullest, enjoying the journey and taking chances. It's about balance.  Our clothing is quality made and our designs are limited edition. That means that you can rest assured that everyone and their mothers won't be wearing the same designs. Only 50-100 of each design will ever be made.

<p>BlackBox is a grill oven. What is so special about it?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439971620/hz99y4lhuqoqwhg5uyrv.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The first prototype was built for a friend who got fed up with the cheap and lousy charcoal grills. He wanted something better than the overpriced charcoal grills, but he didn't want to cook with gas as it would not give that distinct flavour.<br/></p>So the first grill was built in 2012. When we first fired it up we knew we built something special. Since then we kept on designing, and now we have a truly usable product.<br/>As we usually work with motorbikes in the workshop the functionality and simplicity of a design are the key features we are looking for. A good design doesn't need any unnecessary critter, or put it this way ""function before form"".<br/><br/><h2></h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435502901/cuc0tojgmsloqo1exode.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Don't you hate when you have to buy several appliances to cook a few different meals? We have developed our product with modularity in mind. Designed the housing to support a whole bunch of different types of grill cooking.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-pin-nopin=""true"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435503333/zackky1aiyvspea3ghpy.png"" src="""" style=""width: 620px; height: 12px;""/></p>
<p>As we started to test our grill our friends came up with ideas, about how should we cook with it. We tried to incorporate as many methods as we could to give you a good all around tool. So take a look at the different types of cooking that is possible in this oven.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-pin-nopin=""true"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435503364/mdjkgmbr7lkf6fn5wlul.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>Basic grilling</b> - with the use of the simple grate you can cook meat or vegetables over the wood cinder. <br/></p>
<p><b>Flat plate</b> - with this you can cook steaks and hamburgers best.</p>
<p><b>Slow cook</b> - if you add the ""Drip Tray"" below the ""Simple Grate"" you can easily cook big pieces of meat slowly without burning it on the outside. Just pour some water or beer to make that perfect juicy meat.<br/></p>
<p><b>Smoking</b> - you can set up the grill for smoking at low temperatures. This is perfect to cook pulled pork or that unmatchable smoked barbecue which is cooked for several hours for perfection.</p>
<p><b>Grilled chicken</b> - With the help of our ""Skew"" you can easily cook chicken, or anything you'd like on a skew</p>
<p> Because everybody's different we offer the possibility to customize your grill for your needs. If you buy the Basic Model we will ship it to you equipped with a set of simple grates. These are perfect for the simple barbecue. If you want to extend your possibilities you can always add one of our accessories later. Or buy the Deluxe Model which is equipped with all the accessories. <br/></p>
<h2></h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435503483/fnehskkofpgavvspwjdu.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><h4>Firebox</h4>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437921005/dgxsst5wg1xidvklfpqt.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This is were the magic happens. Grilling on open flames is not at all the best solution. This is why we have separated the fire from the cooking area. The carefully designed firebox is optimized to turn wood into cinder just under a matter of minutes. It keeps heat in and allows huge amount of air to feed the fire. When operated correctly this furnace produces large amounts of live cinder that can be used to grill. This method allows for perfect temperature control, while keeping the flavours from the wood smoke inside.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437921241/afglf4obdsohzarjvhq6.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h4><br/></h4>
<h4>The heat storing lining<br/>
</h4>
<div>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437311651/d6cbamsqtkohxukd98p1.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div>One of the biggest problem of the standard charcoal grills is that they cool down instantly when the cinder dies out. With the use of the special heat storing ceramic bricks the temperatures inside change slowly and evenly. Of course it takes some time to warm  it up (25~35 minutes depending on the outside temperature) but once it has been heated it keeps the temperature even. This allows for a much more relaxed pace of grilling. You can adjust the temperature easily with the amount of cinder. Once the fire dies out the lining will keep the inside warm for hours. This way you can keep the food warm for later.</div><div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437921793/lozlcevwicyfrqqgjnox.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<h4>Adjustable and interchangeable grates</h4>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442779038/rddgjkyzrsjiidld4avj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>The height of the grate can be adjusted with the help of two simple handles. This allows for precisely setting up the amount of heat from below. For example for a good steak you want your cooking plate to be as hot as hell so you lower the grate, but for a big chunk of pork you would set it high to let it cook more slower.
<p>We have developed different grates for different cooking styles and dishes. You can easily change these even during grilling. Find which one fits the food you are cooking the best.<br/></p>
<h4><br/></h4>
<h4>Folding Legs</h4>
<p>The legs are always a problem when you want to put away your barbecue, or want to put it into the car...etc. Usually they are fixed with bolts, so it takes time to fix 'em or they just fall out every time you want to lift the thing. BlackBox has stable fold-able legs. They are locked in both open and closed position by simple pin-bolts. You'll never loose the legs, and when you need them it just a moment to fold them out. The legs tall enough to place the grill in a comfortable height for cooking.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437312015/rp592q0xd5vmr7jo3mgi.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<h4>Cinder feed through</h4>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437922084/bbpxbuuj7gqvqyyip8xr.png"" src="""" style=""width: 616px; height: 475px;""/></p>
<p>Once the cinder fell from the firebox you can simply push it below the grates. We realized that when you spend the whole afternoon grilling, eventually you need to clear the ash to make space for the new live cinder. So we made another opening on the opposite side where you can push the cinder through and out. It is great if you are cooking for a lot of friends. Basically you can operate the grill all day and all night long.  <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437312263/a1lfnpiypzxf5nztjekd.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<h4>Cover and vents</h4>
<p>Every decent grill must have a proper cover to keep flavours and heat inside. Ours have one too. We made it hinged instead of the cheap take it off solution. Even if it is hot you can simple fold it open and it locks in. The simple spring loaded mechanism needs only one hand to operate. No more problem if you have a plate in one hand and want to close the lid.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437312418/wmnj7klxji1vmdsbbdpb.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<br/><p>F<span style=""background-color: initial;"">or a better airflow control in the cooking space there are built in vents. They are easy to operate and with the temperature gauge built into the cover you can keep an eye on the process. With the help of the vents you can set your grill into ""Smoking"" mode. By directing the smoke and heat from the firebox into the cooking space you can make a perfect low temperature smoked barbecue.</span></p>

<p>We have built two prototypes and a small batch from the third one. We have put a lot of effort into designing and testing our grill. Now we would like to share the experience with you by offering the BlackBox Grill for pre-order. </p>

<p>With your help we can establish a small business based on the BlackBox grill. We can spend money on marketing and reach an even wider audience. Or dream is not to get rich from this, but to create something we can be truly proud of and provide it to people who can appreciate the quality of a well designed and well built product.<br/></p>
<p>We have designed a whole bunch of clever accessories which you can add to your existing grill thus improving and customizing it to your own needs. But we need a customer basis to offer these for the BlackBOX users.<br/></p>
<p></p>

<p>In contrast with today's consumer society we don't want to create the cheapest possible grill. Sometimes it makes sense to pay a little more for something extra in quality. We want you to feel that if you buy our product than you have a grill for your life. One that you can pass onto your children, and they can to theirs. Like it was in the old days. Because a quality piece of meat grilled to perfection will never go out of date.<br/></p>

<p>I have graduated as a mechanical engineer, but since then I had the opportunity to work in many fields in different industries. I have commissioned wind turbines and for this travelled all around the world. I have repaired and programmed industrial robots and CNC machinery. Currently I am working for a design firm as a design engineer developing prototypes. Besides my professional career I have an almost professional workshop where I have been working ever since I was a little boy. I have modified and repaired motorcycles, built special tools, electric guitars, and for the last few years I am working on the restoration of my '66 VW Beetle. I love to cook and what I enjoy the most is cooking for and with my friends and family. When I am not out riding one of my bikes I am most probably grilling in the backyard with my buddies.<br/></p>

BlackBox is a grill oven. What is so special about it?



The first prototype was built for a friend who got fed up with the cheap and lousy charcoal grills. He wanted something better than the overpriced charcoal grills, but he didn't want to cook with gas as it would not give that distinct flavour.So the first grill was built in 2012. When we first fired it up we knew we built something special. Since then we kept on designing, and now we have a truly usable product.As we usually work with motorbikes in the workshop the functionality and simplicity of a design are the key features we are looking for. A good design doesn't need any unnecessary critter, or put it this way ""function before form"".

Don't you hate when you have to buy several appliances to cook a few different meals? We have developed our product with modularity in mind. Designed the housing to support a whole bunch of different types of grill cooking.



As we started to test our grill our friends came up with ideas, about how should we cook with it. We tried to incorporate as many methods as we could to give you a good all around tool. So take a look at the different types of cooking that is possible in this oven.


Basic grilling - with the use of the simple grate you can cook meat or vegetables over the wood cinder. 
Flat plate - with this you can cook steaks and hamburgers best.
Slow cook - if you add the ""Drip Tray"" below the ""Simple Grate"" you can easily cook big pieces of meat slowly without burning it on the outside. Just pour some water or beer to make that perfect juicy meat.
Smoking - you can set up the grill for smoking at low temperatures. This is perfect to cook pulled pork or that unmatchable smoked barbecue which is cooked for several hours for perfection.
Grilled chicken - With the help of our ""Skew"" you can easily cook chicken, or anything you'd like on a skew
 Because everybody's different we offer the possibility to customize your grill for your needs. If you buy the Basic Model we will ship it to you equipped with a set of simple grates. These are perfect for the simple barbecue. If you want to extend your possibilities you can always add one of our accessories later. Or buy the Deluxe Model which is equipped with all the accessories. 


Firebox


This is were the magic happens. Grilling on open flames is not at all the best solution. This is why we have separated the fire from the cooking area. The carefully designed firebox is optimized to turn wood into cinder just under a matter of minutes. It keeps heat in and allows huge amount of air to feed the fire. When operated correctly this furnace produces large amounts of live cinder that can be used to grill. This method allows for perfect temperature control, while keeping the flavours from the wood smoke inside.





The heat storing lining




One of the biggest problem of the standard charcoal grills is that they cool down instantly when the cinder dies out. With the use of the special heat storing ceramic bricks the temperatures inside change slowly and evenly. Of course it takes some time to warm  it up (25~35 minutes depending on the outside temperature) but once it has been heated it keeps the temperature even. This allows for a much more relaxed pace of grilling. You can adjust the temperature easily with the amount of cinder. Once the fire dies out the lining will keep the inside warm for hours. This way you can keep the food warm for later.




Adjustable and interchangeable grates



The height of the grate can be adjusted with the help of two simple handles. This allows for precisely setting up the amount of heat from below. For example for a good steak you want your cooking plate to be as hot as hell so you lower the grate, but for a big chunk of pork you would set it high to let it cook more slower.
We have developed different grates for different cooking styles and dishes. You can easily change these even during grilling. Find which one fits the food you are cooking the best.

Folding Legs
The legs are always a problem when you want to put away your barbecue, or want to put it into the car...etc. Usually they are fixed with bolts, so it takes time to fix 'em or they just fall out every time you want to lift the thing. BlackBox has stable fold-able legs. They are locked in both open and closed position by simple pin-bolts. You'll never loose the legs, and when you need them it just a moment to fold them out. The legs tall enough to place the grill in a comfortable height for cooking.




Cinder feed through




Once the cinder fell from the firebox you can simply push it below the grates. We realized that when you spend the whole afternoon grilling, eventually you need to clear the ash to make space for the new live cinder. So we made another opening on the opposite side where you can push the cinder through and out. It is great if you are cooking for a lot of friends. Basically you can operate the grill all day and all night long.  




Cover and vents
Every decent grill must have a proper cover to keep flavours and heat inside. Ours have one too. We made it hinged instead of the cheap take it off solution. Even if it is hot you can simple fold it open and it locks in. The simple spring loaded mechanism needs only one hand to operate. No more problem if you have a plate in one hand and want to close the lid.






For a better airflow control in the cooking space there are built in vents. They are easy to operate and with the temperature gauge built into the cover you can keep an eye on the process. With the help of the vents you can set your grill into ""Smoking"" mode. By directing the smoke and heat from the firebox into the cooking space you can make a perfect low temperature smoked barbecue.

We have built two prototypes and a small batch from the third one. We have put a lot of effort into designing and testing our grill. Now we would like to share the experience with you by offering the BlackBox Grill for pre-order. 


With your help we can establish a small business based on the BlackBox grill. We can spend money on marketing and reach an even wider audience. Or dream is not to get rich from this, but to create something we can be truly proud of and provide it to people who can appreciate the quality of a well designed and well built product.
We have designed a whole bunch of clever accessories which you can add to your existing grill thus improving and customizing it to your own needs. But we need a customer basis to offer these for the BlackBOX users.


In contrast with today's consumer society we don't want to create the cheapest possible grill. Sometimes it makes sense to pay a little more for something extra in quality. We want you to feel that if you buy our product than you have a grill for your life. One that you can pass onto your children, and they can to theirs. Like it was in the old days. Because a quality piece of meat grilled to perfection will never go out of date.


Zoltan - Founder / Engineering

I have graduated as a mechanical engineer, but since then I had the opportunity to work in many fields in different industries. I have commissioned wind turbines and for this travelled all around the world. I have repaired and programmed industrial robots and CNC machinery. Currently I am working for a design firm as a design engineer developing prototypes. Besides my professional career I have an almost professional workshop where I have been working ever since I was a little boy. I have modified and repaired motorcycles, built special tools, electric guitars, and for the last few years I am working on the restoration of my '66 VW Beetle. I love to cook and what I enjoy the most is cooking for and with my friends and family. When I am not out riding one of my bikes I am most probably grilling in the backyard with my buddies.

She loved to draw, swim at her grandparents, care for her dog, Teddy, but most important - play with her 4 siblings, Kaleb, 13, Michaela, 9 (her twin), Gabe, 8 and Sammy, 5. The money raised will be used for the family's bereavement counseling, day-to-day expenses and college funds for her siblings. Please help our dear friend and her family cope with this horrible, untimely passing of their daughter and sister, Jordan. Thank you for your generosity. Her friends: Catherine, Tracy, and JoAnne.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Continuous exposure to noise results in significantly raised stress levels and presents a significant barrier to restful sleep, relaxation, or mental focus. QuietOn is an earplug that combines active noise cancellation and acoustic noise attenuation to create silence. These wireless earplugs are designed to fit perfectly in your ears, enabling you to comfortably sleep with your head on a pillow or enjoy some much-needed silence while you work or travel. </p>
<p>Noise that affects sleep can reduce sleep quality and hence affect health and daily performance. Noise can have an enormous effect on mood and concentration. Being fully relaxed is critical in multiple situations eg. when heading to a business negotiation straight after a long flight, going to an important meeting after a long day, having a performance at the stage or a competition at the arena. QuietOn can calm your mind.</p>

<h2><b>The History of QuietOn</b></h2>
<p>It all started in an airport electronics store while waiting for a connection flight. Upon trying on a pair of noise-cancellation headphones, Janne felt like his stress levels had reduced immediately. Then he started thinking: Why hasn’t noise cancellation technology been used more? What are the key issues which prevent its widespread adoption by a wider audience?</p>
<p>The answer was simple: The device needs be wire-free and small enough to fit in the ear, thus enabling sleeping.</p>
<p>When Janne returned home he called Matti and started to discuss how they could miniaturize noise cancellation technology for the earplug form factor. Janne and Matti built several iterations of smaller and smaller prototypes of QuietOn and, finally in early 2015, they had first pair of earplugs, which were small enough to enable sleeping with the head on the pillow, plus noise cancellation performance that was even better than market's leading noise cancellation headphones.</p>
<p>The prototype was put straight into usability testing and was presented to the first investors. The feedback was great and product development was started.</p>
<p> We developed prototypes with improved electronics and industrial design in cooperation with our technology development partner, Haltian. We spent a lot of time analyzing ear anatomy to find the perfect shape, and spent countless days finding ways to make the technology even smaller and more reliable without compromising performance. Additionally, we designed the small charging box to maximize portability and ease of use. With all of these key boxes checked, we filed the appropriate patents and were officially incorporated as QuietOn. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><b>Great Results from Airline Usability Tests</b></h2>
<p>QuietOn noise cancelling earplugs were chosen to participate in Finnair's Test Lab in the Sky program where the airline tests different products and concepts with the aim of improving the travelling experience. In Finnair Test Lab, QuietOn earplugs were given to volunteering customers during select long haul Finnair flights during December 2015 and January 2016<span>. The results from the tests are positive and passengers gave positive feedback for noise cancellation and comfort.</span></p>

<h2><b>How it works?</b></h2>
<div>Active noise cancelling uses a microphone to sample the sound, and a speaker to create a phase-shifted sound that cancels the original sound. </div>
<div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478264408/dykww5ceqjxglul0qatn.jpg"" src=""""/></div>
<div>In full-size on-ear noise cancelling headphones the microphone element is located outside the ear. However, in QuietOn, the microphone that samples the sound is located right inside the ear canal! This means that QuietOn can more accurately produce anti-noise that results in good noise cancellation at the ear drum. By locating the microphone in the air volume of the ear canal, QuietOn is also able to reduce noise that is conducted by the skull into the ear.</div>
<div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478264499/joujppukcivwh8r123r5.jpg"" src=""""/></div>
<div>
<div> </div>
<p>Traditional earplugs use passive attenuation to reduce the level of sound entering the ear. Whilst they are good at blocking high frequency sound, they are quite poor at reducing low frequency sound, especially below 200 Hz.<br/><br/>Thus, the problem area for traditional earplugs is these low frequencies. Examples of such penetrating low frequency sounds are airplane noise (noise level peaks at 70 Hz), noise in factories and noise that comes through the walls of buildings. Also, snoring is mostly comprised of this low frequency sound. When you use passive earplugs on an airplane, you will notice that, although it reduces sounds from people chatting in the cabin, the background engine noise is almost unchanged.<br/><br/>QuietOn earplugs combine the advantages of in-ear passive earplugs with active noise cancelling, providing optimal noise reduction across the whole audible spectrum. This makes QuietOn ideal for use in a variety of noisy environments.</p>

<p>Q: If you compare QuietOn earplugs to other similar kind of products, how competitive is the product's noise cancelling performance?</p>
<p>A: We have tested competitor devices in our laboratory and also compared with results published on testing sites. We have not found any noise cancellation devices that have better performance than QuietOn.</p>
<p>Q: For what kind of noise situations is the product designed for?</p>
<p>A: The passive part of the noise cancellation works as an old fashioned passive earplug. In addition to that we have active noise cancellation, which is very effective at attenuating noise below 1KHz in frequency. Some examples of this low frequency noise are music or traffic sound coming through the walls, engine sound or snoring.</p>
<p>Q: What are the QuietOn's earplug's benefits compared to normal earplugs?</p>
<p>A: Normal earplugs are comfortable but unfortunately they are not able to block low frequency noise. QuietOn is the only earplug which can block low frequency noise.</p>
<p>Q: Can I listen to music with QuietOn earplugs?</p>
<p>A: The earplugs are intended for making silence. There is no Bluetooth connection and music playback is not supported.</p>
<p>Q: Is QuietOn able to minimize the effects of tinnitus (ringing inside the ears)?</p>
<p>A: Staying in a noisy environment might make tinnitus worse afterwards. Therefore we think QuietOn with its good noise reducing capabilities can work as a preventive action. On the other hand, tinnitus becomes more noticeable in silence, so the earplugs might not help if your ears are already ringing. QuietOn isn't able to turn tinnitus off because according to our understanding it isn't real noise but an error signal inside the head.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Q: How do I insert and use the QuietOn earplugs correctly?</span></p>
<p>A: Please check out the “How it Works” section above. Also make sure the device is inserted correctly in ears to get full performance. The earplug must be in the right angle, choose also correct size of tips. The device must be airtight. When the ear canal is sealed you can feel ""small pressure"" inside and hear small electronical background noise of the product.</p>

QuietOn is an earplug that combines active noise cancellation and acoustic noise attenuation to create silence. The earplugs have no wires and are small enough to fit in your ears, enabling you to comfortably sleep with your head on a pillow. The noise cancellation is optimized to reduce noises that affect sleep, such as noise coming through walls and snoring. 
 

 
Continuous exposure to noise results in significantly raised stress levels and presents a significant barrier to restful sleep, relaxation, or mental focus. QuietOn is an earplug that combines active noise cancellation and acoustic noise attenuation to create silence. These wireless earplugs are designed to fit perfectly in your ears, enabling you to comfortably sleep with your head on a pillow or enjoy some much-needed silence while you work or travel. 
Noise that affects sleep can reduce sleep quality and hence affect health and daily performance. Noise can have an enormous effect on mood and concentration. Being fully relaxed is critical in multiple situations eg. when heading to a business negotiation straight after a long flight, going to an important meeting after a long day, having a performance at the stage or a competition at the arena. QuietOn can calm your mind.

The History of QuietOn
It all started in an airport electronics store while waiting for a connection flight. Upon trying on a pair of noise-cancellation headphones, Janne felt like his stress levels had reduced immediately. Then he started thinking: Why hasn’t noise cancellation technology been used more? What are the key issues which prevent its widespread adoption by a wider audience?
The answer was simple: The device needs be wire-free and small enough to fit in the ear, thus enabling sleeping.
When Janne returned home he called Matti and started to discuss how they could miniaturize noise cancellation technology for the earplug form factor. Janne and Matti built several iterations of smaller and smaller prototypes of QuietOn and, finally in early 2015, they had first pair of earplugs, which were small enough to enable sleeping with the head on the pillow, plus noise cancellation performance that was even better than market's leading noise cancellation headphones.
The prototype was put straight into usability testing and was presented to the first investors. The feedback was great and product development was started.
 We developed prototypes with improved electronics and industrial design in cooperation with our technology development partner, Haltian. We spent a lot of time analyzing ear anatomy to find the perfect shape, and spent countless days finding ways to make the technology even smaller and more reliable without compromising performance. Additionally, we designed the small charging box to maximize portability and ease of use. With all of these key boxes checked, we filed the appropriate patents and were officially incorporated as QuietOn. 
 
Great Results from Airline Usability Tests
QuietOn noise cancelling earplugs were chosen to participate in Finnair's Test Lab in the Sky program where the airline tests different products and concepts with the aim of improving the travelling experience. In Finnair Test Lab, QuietOn earplugs were given to volunteering customers during select long haul Finnair flights during December 2015 and January 2016. The results from the tests are positive and passengers gave positive feedback for noise cancellation and comfort.

<p>The COMO Derby Dames, Columbia's only all-women, flat-track roller derby league, has played a pivotal role in promoting female empowerment in the Columbia community since 2007. <br/></p>
<p>In 2011, the Dames were accepted to the Women's Flat Track Roller Derby Association (WFTDA) as a Class B member in the North Central Region - which meant they had to leave the friendly confines of their local COMO venue behind due to safety reasons. <br/></p>
<p>""From 2008 to 2011, the team competed at the Boone County Fairgrounds — 
the girls would arrive early to clean horse manure off the floor and 
duct tape mattresses around the poles in the middle of the rink."" (<a href=""http://www.insidecolumbia.net/June-2012/Surly-Gurlies/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Inside Columbia Magazine, 2012</a>)<br/></p>
<p>The Dames headed to Jefferson City, more than a 30 minute drive away from the town they lived and practiced in.  They have been there ever since.  <br/></p>
<p>Now the Dames have the chance to come back to Columbia - for good!  We have the building, fans, drive, and determination...we just need a floor.  <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>To purchase hardboard flooring, plywood under-flooring, storage space rental, sound equipment, and seating options, we need to raise $10,000 by December 2014.</p>
<p>We have a ton of uniquely COMO Derby Dames swag to reward you with for supporting the Dames. Anything from a high five to a custom taxidermied domestic animal, we've got you covered. All contributions received will still be used to bring the Dames back to COMO.</p>
<p>We are motivated to make a COMO homecoming, and while we hope our triumphant return will be for the 2015 season, we understand that fundraising can be challenging. We vow to keep chipping away at our $10,000 goal until we can come home. <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>First and foremost, roller derby is powerful for all who participate. The COMO Derby Dames are a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, putting emphasis on giving back to our community - on and off skates. <br/></p>
<p>We have volunteered with a number of organizations including:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Children's Miracle Network</li>
<li>Safe Kids Discovery Day at University Women &amp; Childrens Hospital</li>
<li>Challenger Baseball</li>
<li>Ronald McDonald House</li>
<li>Relay for Life</li>
<li>Mid-Missouri PrideFest</li>
<li>Earth Day</li>
<li>True/False Film Festival</li>
<li>Citizen Jane Film Festival</li>
<li>ALS Association</li>
<li>Voluntary Action Center</li>
<li>Food Bank for Central and Northeast Missouri<br/>
</li>
</ul>Your contribution in bringing the Dames back to Columbia would allow us to devote more time to giving back to our community. We have successfully navigated being a competitive roller derby league as well as a volunteer organization for over 8 years. We look forward to many more to come in our hometown. <br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Challenges:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Our Columbia venue does not have a floor suitable for a derby bout. <br/>
</li>
<li>We have to have a floor in order to return to COMO. The benefit of purchasing a floor allows us to grow and improve in Columbia. <br/>
</li>
<li>We are an entirely volunteer run organization - everyone wants to help. However, we have created a top-down approach to organization and leadership within the league for this fundraiser.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Can't donate? Share this far and wide with your friends and family. We know the roller derby community is huge and would appreciate your support in spreading the word. <br/></p>
<p>We will need people to help us in the 2015 season as we (hopefully) transition to a new venue with the fancy new floor YOU helped us purchase. Volunteers are an essential part of our derby family - come join us!<br/></p>
<p>Get out there and donate, spread the word, and bring us home!<br/></p>

  The Impact First and foremost, roller derby is powerful for all who participate. The COMO Derby Dames are a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, putting emphasis on giving back to our community - on and off skates. 
We have volunteered with a number of organizations including:


Children's Miracle Network
Safe Kids Discovery Day at University Women & Childrens Hospital
Challenger Baseball
Ronald McDonald House
Relay for Life
Mid-Missouri PrideFest
Earth Day
True/False Film Festival
Citizen Jane Film Festival
ALS Association
Voluntary Action Center
Food Bank for Central and Northeast Missouri

Your contribution in bringing the Dames back to Columbia would allow us to devote more time to giving back to our community. We have successfully navigated being a competitive roller derby league as well as a volunteer organization for over 8 years. We look forward to many more to come in our hometown. 
  Risks & Challenges Challenges:


Our Columbia venue does not have a floor suitable for a derby bout. 

We have to have a floor in order to return to COMO. The benefit of purchasing a floor allows us to grow and improve in Columbia. 

We are an entirely volunteer run organization - everyone wants to help. However, we have created a top-down approach to organization and leadership within the league for this fundraiser.


  Other Ways You Can Help Can't donate? Share this far and wide with your friends and family. We know the roller derby community is huge and would appreciate your support in spreading the word. 
We will need people to help us in the 2015 season as we (hopefully) transition to a new venue with the fancy new floor YOU helped us purchase. Volunteers are an essential part of our derby family - come join us!
Get out there and donate, spread the word, and bring us home!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

  The Impact Currently, Jack and Earlene are borrowing water from their neighbor through a water hose that has been stretched across the fence between the two properties.  They have limited their water use to 2 minute showers and restricting their flushing.  Also, they are having to take their laundry to a laundromat and driving to the grocery store to fill up 5 gallon jugs for drinking and cooking water.
Please, help us help our parents.  We do not want to see them spending their golden years struggling for something as basic as water.  They have sacrificed so much for us and others.  They have shown love to so many throughout the years.  Help us show them how much we care about them.

benefits of meditation include better social and emotional skills. Children who 
meditate do better in school, and have better organizational skills and 
ability to plan and complete their school work.  In most cases, student 
grades improve. Adults find that their memory improves and levels of 
stress or anxiety decrease, while quality of sleep improves 
significantly.  Finally, practicing meditation, along with healthy 
eating and regular exercise can have other health benefits, improving

11 Reasons I Wrote this Book For YOU!  I wrote this book for you because YOU:
1.  Hate the idea of
going to a counselor but
want to know what goes on in there.
2.  Are feeling too blah to call for an
appointment.
3.  Can’t afford a counselor, but can afford $5.00 for a book.
4. 
 Are looking for the simple truth about how to get better.
5.  Are scared that
there is something irreparably wrong with you.
6.  Are tired of
psychological mumbo-jumbo that
makes the simple complicated.
7.  Think an expert is
someone who tells you something you already know in a way you can’t understand!
8. 
I wrote this book to give you hope!
9. 
I wrote this book because a word picture is better than a thousand words!
10.  I wrote this book because I have been mangled by many therapists. ;-|
11. 
 I wrote this book because I get to see miracles!

The ""emmit"" part? Well, let’s just say it’s a creative spelling of ""emit"" as in ""emitting electromagnetic pulses.""</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;""><strong>Is ELF emmit a safe device?</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">Of course! We’ve created ELF emmit as device that relies exclusively on natural extra-low frequency electromagnetic pulses, which are complementary to the chemistry and functions of the body. It is entirely non-invasive and completely safe.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;""><strong>Is it FDA approved?</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">ELF emmit doesn’t require a FDA approval, as it’s not considered a medical device. But the scientific principle on which it is based, PEMT (pulsed electromagnetic therapy) is FDA approved.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;""><strong>Why is ELF emmit a headband?</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">Low frequency electromagnetic pulses that ELF emmit produces penetrate through the body. However, the intensity decreases as the distance grows from the target area: the brain. That's why we designed ELF emmit as a headband.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;""><strong>Can I wear ELF emmit for a longer period?</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">Yes. But we recommend you to follow the user guide instructions. Why? Because using a single frequency longer than necessary may lead to loss of a benefit previously experienced. It's like entering a room full of flowers. After a while you get accustomed to the scent.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;""><strong>How can I charge my ELF emmit?</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">ELF emmit uses your mobile phone or tablet as its energy source, plugged in via the headphone jack.

Our bodies are electrical and chemical: every heartbeat generates electromagnetic pulses that chemically stimulate tissues and cells. ELF emmit encourages the brain to produce a certain rhythm that best suits the state of mind you’d like to be in, with the use of low frequency electromagnetic stimulation.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;""><strong>Uh, what’s PEMS technology, again?</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">Brain frequencies are produced by masses of neurons communicating with each other, changing according to what we are doing or feeling. Different brain frequencies result in different states of mind.</span></p><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">PEMS technology uses very weak electro-magnetic impulses in extra-low frequencies, to encourage our mind to work at a speed we choose, to best perform the task at hand. In the same way that meditating along with the rhythmic sound of drums, gong therapy and steady flashing lights all transport you into a state of thoughtfulness and transcendence, PEMS can guide your mood.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;""><strong>Is the efficacy of PEMS scientifically supported?</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">Yes, it is! The concepts behind PEMS technology have been around for millennia. The ancient Greek physician, Galen, wrote about the healing properties of magnets back around 200 BC, and it has always been a staple of Chinese medicine. Even in the US, it was used widely until 1908, when a medical report by physician Abraham Flexner dramatically changed the way America medicated, leading to a shift towards an almost complete reliance on pharmaceuticals over other, less-invasive treatments. There are several variations on this therapy such as PEMF (pulsed electromagnetic field therapy and PEMT (pulsed electromagnetic therapy). </span></p><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">PEMS, PEMT and PEMF have a rich history in the US, as well as FDA approval. Magnetic therapy was marginalized in the US until the early 1970s, when a Dr Friedenberg published his findings that electromagnetic field therapy helped certain types of bone fractures to heal more quickly than similar fractures in patients who were not exposed to this treatment. This was expanded by Dr Andrew Bassett of Columbia University Medical Center, who in 1974, found further success in treating non-healing bone fractures and pseudarthroses, with the use of low frequency electromagnetic signals. In 1979, the FDA approved the use of electromagnetic therapy for fractures. A decade later, the FDA approved its use for treating pain and edema. In 2011, transcranial magnetic stimulation received FDA approval for treating depression, and for treating migraines in 2013. ELF emmit draws on this long, rich history of the scientifically-proven success of electromagnetic therapy. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;""><strong>Do I need to be at a certain place to use ELF emmit?</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">Not at all. You can use it anywhere. All you need is a tablet or smart phone to choose the working mode.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;""><strong>Can the ELF emmit improve my general health?</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">Absolutely! ELF emmit can help reduce stress, improve concentration and aid sleeping.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;""><strong>How does ELF emmit influence my body?</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">ELF emmit produces low frequency electromagnetic pulses that gently encourage your brain waves to join in with the chosen frequency of the pulses. With regular use, your brain will quickly synchronize with your chosen state of mind, thanks to ELF emmit acting as an intermediary.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;""><strong>Will I feel the effects right away?</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">You will not feel the effects the instant you turn on the device for the first time. ELF emmit trains your brain, rather than suddenly altering it the moment you first turn it on. We recommend regular use for at least a week, at which point you will certainly notice a difference. The brain takes a bit of time and practice to synchronize with the pulses produced by ELF emmit. Once your brain has been trained to sync with ELF emmit, you should feel results immediately and regularly when using it.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;""><strong>Can I use ELF emmit too much?</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">No. Low frequency electromagnetic stimulation has minimal-to-no effect on healthy cells. Actually it seems to be ignored by cells that are in optimal condition, balanced and in no need for extra energy. Use it as much as you like, but only when you need it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;""><strong>I was told electromagnetic waves produce ""electro smog,"" and that this is a bad thing.</strong></span></p><p><span style=""font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">Electro smog comes from devices with particular field strengths and high frequencies. These frequencies can induce heat in tissue and potentially damage cells. Our technology is based on carefully-selected low frequency stimulation that is non-invasive, natural, and does not create electro smog.

We couldn’t have done it without you, and your support really overwhelmed us. Over 400% of our target goal is truly amazing. We are humbled and grateful.The time has come for you to choose your preferred color, an option which was unlocked by achieving our stretch target. Please fill it out the short survey  that will be sent  to you in the this week (aroudd 23.9.) we’ve prepared—in it, you’ll be able to choose your preferred color (for one or more ELF emmits, depending on how many you ordered). You’ll have a week to fill out the survey and choose, and then we’ll be sending out the units! In order to arrange the color options, there will be a very slight delay in shipping out ELF emmits to all of you. Instead of them shipping 30 September we plan to ship October 25—when you receive them depends really on the postal service (they will ship from Europe, and we’ll send them first to those who backed us earliest). Please find all info about your Elfemmit on  http://www.elfemmit.com/indiegogoThank you all and very best wishes!The ELF emmit team   Reserve Today to Ensure Priority September Delivery           Synchronize your mind and body.   The only wearable using cutting-edge neuroscience to guide the natural frequencies & rhythms of your mind.  ELF emmit uses non-invasive and FDA Approved technology to actively influence positive change in your daily life by emitting pulses at specific frequencies, optimized to attain a desired state of mind, at any given moment.   This FDA Approved technology known as Pulsed Electromagnetic Stimulation (PEMS) has nearly 50 years of medical/neurological applications and scientifically-proven health benefits, with it's origins dating back to ancient times.Until now, similar technological devices were big, heavy, expensive and not convenient for daily use. We’ve adapted this technology to make a product that is wearable daily and affordable to everybody.  THE NATURAL FREQUENCY OF YOUR MINDAll humans display (5) five different types of electrical patterns or ""brain waves"" across the cortex that can be observed with an EEG (electroencephalograph). Your moods – whether you are relaxed, focused, stressed, tired, or distracted – are directly tied to the electrical activity in your brain. The (5) five brain waves in order of highest frequency to lowest: 
Gamma Wave 
Beta Wave (concentration)
Alpha Wave (anti-stress/deep learning)
Theta Wave (meditation)
Delta Wave (sleep)
 Your mind and body are often at odds with the tasks you are trying to accomplish. When we’re focusing hard, our brainwaves spike up to 30 Hz per second. The ELF emmit emits pulses from 2 Hz up to 19 Hz—nothing beyond the natural rhythm of the mind.  Our brain’s ability to transition through various brain wave frequencies plays a large role in how successful we are at managing stress, focusing on tasks, and getting a good night’s sleep.​      STRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED! Thanks to the incredible support from our backers, the ELF emmit campaign has passed $100,000! We're rewarding every backer with their choice of four additional stylish two-tone color combinations. At the end of our campaign, backers will receive a survey allowing them to select from the standard all White, White/Blue, White/Green, White/Purple, or White/Translucent. HOW ELF EMMIT IMPROVES LIFE IN ALMOST ANY SITUATIONThe ELF emmit contains an electromagnetic coil, allowing it to emit extra-low frequency electromagnetic pulses complementary to the brainwaves your body already produces.  These pulses target the cerebellum, gently coaxing your current brainwave frequency to speed up or slow down and match your desired mood.Each of ELF emmit's (5) mood settings emit pulses at a specific frequency, optimized to help you attain and transition to your desired state of mind.  SELECT A DESIRED MOOD TO MATCH THE NATURAL FREQUENCY OF YOUR MINDThe ELF emmit emits pulses from 2 Hz up to 19 Hz to coax your desired brainwaves along—nothing beyond the mind's natural rhythm.  CONCENTRATEHIGH FREQUENCY BETA WAVES FOR CONCENTRATION & FOCUSThe quick pulses of ELF emmit’s Concentrate Mood multiply your ability to problem-solve, to process information, to multitask and to remain focused and alert.The Beta waves this mood promotes are very fast (high frequency, low amplitude) brain waves that most people exhibit throughout the day in order to complete conscious tasks such as critical thinking, writing, reading, and socialization. They tend to have a stimulating effect. Having an appropriate level of beta waves allows us to focus and complete school or work-based tasks easily. When you drink caffeine or have another stimulant, your beta activity will naturally increase.  ANTI-STRESSMODERATE FREQUENCY ALPHA WAVES TO REDUCE STRESSELF emmit's Anti-Stress Mood induces alpha brainwaves that help to calm you down, inducing a peaceful state of mind. This frequency range bridges the gap between our conscious thinking and subconscious mind, or between beta and theta. It helps us calm down when necessary and promotes feelings of deep relaxation. If we become stressed, a phenomenon called ""alpha blocking"" may occur which involves excessive beta activity and very little alpha. Essentially the beta waves ""block"" out the production of alpha waves, because we are too agitated.  DEEP LEARNINGALPHA WAVES FOR LEARNING & RETENTIONELF emmit‘s Deep Learning Mood induces a state similar to the one we achieve just before we fall asleep and just after we wake up, increasing your ability to learn and retain knowledge by a huge degree.Induce a state of learning at anytime, increasing your ability to learn and retain knowledge up to 4 times. These waves are important for cognitive functioning, learning, memory and information processing. Thought processes for learning are most flexible when the mind is tuned from beta to alpha state.  MEDITATESLOW FREQUENCY THETA WAVES FOR MEDITATIONELF emmit's Meditate Mood induces a predominance of theta brain waves, which enable you to control your mental processes and optimally balance all your cognitive functions.Theta waves are connected to us experiencing and feeling deep, raw emotions in a deeply relaxed, semi-hypnotic state. A predominance of theta waves boosts our intuition and creativity, and makes us feel more natural. It is also involved in restorative sleep. As long as theta waves aren't produced in excess during our waking hours, they are a very helpful brain wave range.  SLEEPSLOWEST FREQUENCY DELTA WAVES FOR RESTORATIVE SLEEPELF emmit's Sleep Mood induces a predominance of delta brain waves, the slowest band it stimulates. With delta brain waves dominating, your body rests, its functions rest, and your immune system is boosted.These are the slowest recorded brain waves in human beings, found most often in infants and young children (they sleep a lot) but as we age, we produce less, even during deep sleep. Delta waves are associated with the deepest levels of relaxation and restorative, healing sleep. Adequate production of delta waves helps us feel completely rejuvenated after we wake up from a good night’s sleep.  ​    THE SMARTPHONE APP CONTROLS AN ELECTROMAGNETIC COIL VIA THE HEADPHONE JACKOur emotions and other external stimuli can cause our mental frequency to shift, disrupting our ability to function as we might like. ELF emmit encourages this frequency to get back in line with the task at hand.  Your moods – whether you are relaxed, focused, stressed, tired, or distracted – are directly tied to the electrical activity in your brain. Powered by your smartphone and using a free app with an easy to use interface, ELF emmit can help you train your brainwaves to sync up with the mood you want to reach.  Choose a mood in the free mobile app, and ELF emmit will start to work. With repeated use, your brain will grow accustomed to the stimuli ELF emmit produces and adapt more and more quickly. =    THE PACE OF MODERN LIFE HAS GROWN INCREASINGLY RAPID AND STRESSFULFor many, it is difficult to imagine taking the time to relax, to light a fire in your hearth and just sit and watch it, to meditate, to ride a train and fall asleep to the smooth sound of turning wheels. Playing drums or meditating in the middle of the office seem equally unimaginable. The ELF emmit offers an alternative solution.  FDA approved technology implemented in a 100% safe, non-invasive deviceThe PEMS technology used in the ELF emmit has been approved by the FDA for medical applications, and is completely safe and non-invasive. Running at 3.4 millitesla (mT), a measurement of magnetic fields, the ELF emmit is totally harmless. It is just powerful enough to be recognized and responded to by our brains.  Quality materials to last a lifetimeELF emmit uses simple construction without many moving parts and is built from resilient poly-carbonate and thermoplastic. It will stand the test of time, even with repeated daily use.   Carefully crafted with sleek, modern designExpertly designed in a slim, elegant headband, the ELF emmit is equally at home in your place of residence, the office, or anywhere else. While most devices utilizing PEMS technology are bulky, heavy, and require a power outlet to run, the ELF emmit weighs just .7 ounces and gets all its power from your headphone jack. It is light enough to be taken wherever you go and be worn all day or night.  Open source for endless possibilitiesELF emmit's software is entirely open source. Right now, students and their professors as well as expert specialists are working on new and exciting applications for the system.In addition to developing our own new programs, we’ll carefully check any that are sent to us and add them to the app if they really do work.​  In the past, people used extremely low frequencies to achieve altered states of consciousness. Meditation along with the rhythmic sound of drums, gong therapy, or steady flashing lights can all transport you into a state of thoughtfulness and transcendence. Even the sound of rolling wheels when riding a train can put us to sleep. The brain reacts to every color, voice, sound, loved one, and dissatisfaction. The ELF emmit taps into this reaction, blending the traditions of the past with the technology of the future - wearables grounded in neuroscience. It uses state-of-the-art extra-low frequency pulsed electromagnetic therapy to naturally and non-invasively optimize the performance of your mind and body.Our minds and bodies run at different speeds, depending on what we are doing. Problems arise when, because of upper impact interference, your brain frequency is not aligned with what you are trying to do or to achieve. We have all experienced how fear and stress inhibit you from thinking clearly and concentrating. Don’t forget what happens to our concentration when we are in love! We may feel great, but we’re in big trouble if we have to concentrate on something other than the object of our affections. In the same way, external electrical frequencies, not aligned with our brain frequencies, can disrupt our ability to function as we might like. These emotions and external stimuli cause our brain frequency to swing sharply, and our level of concentration moves along with it. Unfortunately, we are not all yoga gurus, able to balance ourselves through meditation, wherever we find ourselves.Imagine if you could rewire your brain to connect a situation to the mental state that best suits it, by choosing yourself. That is what the ELF emmit will help you achieve.  ​  Is your video available in other languages?Yes it is!

The ""emmit"" part? Well, let’s just say it’s a creative spelling of ""emit"" as in ""emitting electromagnetic pulses."" Is ELF emmit a safe device?Of course! We’ve created ELF emmit as device that relies exclusively on natural extra-low frequency electromagnetic pulses, which are complementary to the chemistry and functions of the body. It is entirely non-invasive and completely safe. Is it FDA approved?ELF emmit doesn’t require a FDA approval, as it’s not considered a medical device. But the scientific principle on which it is based, PEMT (pulsed electromagnetic therapy) is FDA approved. Why is ELF emmit a headband?Low frequency electromagnetic pulses that ELF emmit produces penetrate through the body. However, the intensity decreases as the distance grows from the target area: the brain. That's why we designed ELF emmit as a headband. Can I wear ELF emmit for a longer period?Yes. But we recommend you to follow the user guide instructions. Why? Because using a single frequency longer than necessary may lead to loss of a benefit previously experienced. It's like entering a room full of flowers. After a while you get accustomed to the scent. How can I charge my ELF emmit?ELF emmit uses your mobile phone or tablet as its energy source, plugged in via the headphone jack. As long as your phone or tablet is charged, ELF emmit is charged, too. What are the benefits of my ELF emmit being powered via the headphone jack?This system offers a safety guarantee—if you are comfortable wearing headphones, which get their power from the headphone jack, then you’ll be just as comfortable wearing the ELF emmit, as the same, entirely harmless, amount of electricity powers both. This also allowed us to make the ELF emmit as slim and lightweight as possible, since it does not need to contain a bulky battery. How does the ELF emmit smart phone application send information to the device?The ELF emmit application communicates with the ELF Emmit device via the cable, which plugs into the headphone jack of your tablet or smartphone, and which likewise powers the device. Can ELF emmit get wet?ELF emmit is water resistant, but not waterproof. It will do well through the normal day-to-day use, but please don’t go scuba diving with it. Do you protect my privacy and how?We absolutely protect your privacy, at a very high level. All your data belongs to you. We take the responsibility of protecting your data and privacy seriously. You can read more about our data privacy policy here. Can I become a domestic or international dealer of ELF emmit?Of course. We strongly support this idea of yours, and will help you as much as possible! To apply, please email us. You will receive an email confirmation and shortly thereafter our marketing team will contact you and walk you through the process. What technology does ELF emmit use?It uses PEMS (pulsed electromagnetic stimulation) technology that naturally changes the predominant brain speed pattern. Our bodies are electrical and chemical: every heartbeat generates electromagnetic pulses that chemically stimulate tissues and cells. ELF emmit encourages the brain to produce a certain rhythm that best suits the state of mind you’d like to be in, with the use of low frequency electromagnetic stimulation. Uh, what’s PEMS technology, again?Brain frequencies are produced by masses of neurons communicating with each other, changing according to what we are doing or feeling. Different brain frequencies result in different states of mind.PEMS technology uses very weak electro-magnetic impulses in extra-low frequencies, to encourage our mind to work at a speed we choose, to best perform the task at hand. In the same way that meditating along with the rhythmic sound of drums, gong therapy and steady flashing lights all transport you into a state of thoughtfulness and transcendence, PEMS can guide your mood. Is the efficacy of PEMS scientifically supported?Yes, it is! The concepts behind PEMS technology have been around for millennia. The ancient Greek physician, Galen, wrote about the healing properties of magnets back around 200 BC, and it has always been a staple of Chinese medicine. Even in the US, it was used widely until 1908, when a medical report by physician Abraham Flexner dramatically changed the way America medicated, leading to a shift towards an almost complete reliance on pharmaceuticals over other, less-invasive treatments. There are several variations on this therapy such as PEMF (pulsed electromagnetic field therapy and PEMT (pulsed electromagnetic therapy). PEMS, PEMT and PEMF have a rich history in the US, as well as FDA approval. Magnetic therapy was marginalized in the US until the early 1970s, when a Dr Friedenberg published his findings that electromagnetic field therapy helped certain types of bone fractures to heal more quickly than similar fractures in patients who were not exposed to this treatment. This was expanded by Dr Andrew Bassett of Columbia University Medical Center, who in 1974, found further success in treating non-healing bone fractures and pseudarthroses, with the use of low frequency electromagnetic signals. In 1979, the FDA approved the use of electromagnetic therapy for fractures. A decade later, the FDA approved its use for treating pain and edema. In 2011, transcranial magnetic stimulation received FDA approval for treating depression, and for treating migraines in 2013. ELF emmit draws on this long, rich history of the scientifically-proven success of electromagnetic therapy.  Do I need to be at a certain place to use ELF emmit?Not at all. You can use it anywhere. All you need is a tablet or smart phone to choose the working mode. Can the ELF emmit improve my general health?Absolutely! ELF emmit can help reduce stress, improve concentration and aid sleeping. How does ELF emmit influence my body?ELF emmit produces low frequency electromagnetic pulses that gently encourage your brain waves to join in with the chosen frequency of the pulses. With regular use, your brain will quickly synchronize with your chosen state of mind, thanks to ELF emmit acting as an intermediary. Will I feel the effects right away?You will not feel the effects the instant you turn on the device for the first time. ELF emmit trains your brain, rather than suddenly altering it the moment you first turn it on. We recommend regular use for at least a week, at which point you will certainly notice a difference. The brain takes a bit of time and practice to synchronize with the pulses produced by ELF emmit. Once your brain has been trained to sync with ELF emmit, you should feel results immediately and regularly when using it. Can I use ELF emmit too much?No. Low frequency electromagnetic stimulation has minimal-to-no effect on healthy cells. Actually it seems to be ignored by cells that are in optimal condition, balanced and in no need for extra energy. Use it as much as you like, but only when you need it.  I was told electromagnetic waves produce ""electro smog,"" and that this is a bad thing.Electro smog comes from devices with particular field strengths and high frequencies. These frequencies can induce heat in tissue and potentially damage cells. Our technology is based on carefully-selected low frequency stimulation that is non-invasive, natural, and does not create electro smog. No worries. Does ELF emmit work with iOS and Android?Yes. ELF emmit works with both iOS and Android. Where can I download the application?The application is available both in Google Play and the Apple Store. What devices are compatible with ELF emmit?Most smart phones and tablets are compatible with Elf emmit. Is there a web application?We do not have a web application at this time. Do I have to pay for the app?The ELF emmit application is absolutely free. What is your returns policy?During the Indiegogo campaign, you can get a refund via Indiegogo anytime. But we are so confident in the quality and efficacy of our products that we are happy to offer a complete 30-day, money-back guarantee after the campaign, as well. Just visit our website, www.elfemmit.com, which will go live after the campaign, and there will be a ""returns"" button. We will give you a 100% refund if you are not completely satisfied within 30 days of your receipt of our product, no questions asked.  How can I tell that it’s on and working?The electromagnetic pulses produced by ELF emmit have no physical sensation on the skin, which is one of the reasons it’s so non-invasive, comfortable and easy to use regularly. Plugged in, and with the app running, the ELF emmit is working—the screen will dim, and the text will indicate that the device is working. The app is designed to tell you if there is a problem and the product is not functioning. Is ELF emmit recommended by health professionals?Yes, it is. Although ELF emmit is not a medical device, and does not substitute for medical advice or doctor’s appointments, health professionals endorse ELF emmit and believe that it contributes to better overall health, primarily through decreasing stress, increasing concentration and improving sleep. Is ELF emmit a medical device?No. ELF emmit does not diagnose or cure any health condition or problem, so it is not officially considered a medical device, though it can contribute to better overall well-being and an improved lifestyle. Do you ship internationally?Yes, we do, and all shipping charges are covered when you back our project.",48.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>In March of 2010, a group of seven medical professionals traveled to Tanzania and set up clinics that provided free health care to the people of Karance and Sanya Juu.  In May of 2011, we will be going to Kenya to do it all again!  The team is comprised of nurses, doctors, and social workers mostly from the Upstate New York area.  We will be focusing on the area of Kibera, the largest slum in Africa.  Our patients will have free access to our medical care which will include diabetic and blood pressure screenings, treatment of infections, and wound care.  We will also provide medications, walkers and canes, as well as shoes and clothing.  We leave from New York on May 14th and spend two weeks at our clinic.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<h3>The Impact  </h3>
<p>We will be setting up a clinic where we will screen, diagnose, and treat anyone who comes to see us.  The clinic will be free of charge and stocked with medications, dressings, medical equipment, and caring individuals.  The group will include several nurses, a social worker, and physicians trained in different areas of expertise.  </p>
<p><font color=""#000000"" size=""3""></font> </p>
<p>The people we will see and treat rarely visit a doctor due to their lack of access to medical care.  We expect to see cases similar to those in Tanzania which ranged from wounds and parasites to severe infections, high blood pressure and diabetes.  Some of these conditions will prove fatal without our treatment.  In Kenya, we hope to continue our efforts to save and improve the lives of our patients as we did in Tanzania. </p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>This trip will cost each person approximately $4,500.  This includes airfare, safe housing and food for fourteen days, transportation, and medications and supplies for the clinic.  Whatever money we raise will go towards offsetting these costs for the members of our group and supplying our clinic.</p>

<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What's this about?</span></h3>
<p>Some, but not all, of you may know that I have Type 1 diabetes, like the girl in the video, and have for almost 20 years. Holy cow! Here are some facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have to check my blood glucose at least 6-10 times a day, if not more.</li>
<li>Because my immune system waged war on my pancreas, I have to take insulin every day no matter what.</li>
<li>When I exercise, I have to be aware of what is going on with my glucose levels because I might go too low (feed me Gu!) or too high (DKA=bad news).</li>
</ul>
<p>This fundraising campaign is important to me because if I can attend CampWILD I will learn how to be good about glucose control while doing endurance sports! By donating, you will be helping me:</p>
<ol>
<li>Live longer and be healthier.</li>
<li>Gain knowledge and skills.</li>
<li>Give back to the supportive community of endurance athletes with chronic medical conditions that has supported me in my efforts so far.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think the most important thing here is that by funding this cause you will be making a significant and lasting impact that you will be able to see and experience. Last year I asked you to donate to a large organization, the ADA, for a similar reason. This year, I'm asking you to donate to help a diabetic in an immediate and very impactful way.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Where will the money go?</h3>
<p>I'm asking for $2,200 because that is the cost of the camp, plus covering the fees from Paypal. From the CampWILD website, here is a breakdown of what is provided:</p>
<ul>
<li>Professional guidance from the pros (they work with Elite athletes!).</li>
<li>Meals for the week of camp.</li>
<li>A lifetime of better health and positive impact.</li>

<h2>Can
humanity risk losing this
knowledge?</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
Indigenous concepts of health and illness is wholistic in nature, encompassing all that is experienced by a human in relation to his or her surroundings, including activities, family, community, and the natural environment. For an illness to be  treated, the  healer will focus essentially on reestablishing the patient’s essential balance as much within himself as with his social group and the spiritual forces. To this, sacred plants play an essential role in healing the patient.
Due to myriad social, economic and political pressures, Indigenous peoples’ separation from their traditional health practices is having a devastating impact. The pressures of modern development have degraded environmental and cultural support systems. The impact of this loss is widely felt throughout Indigenous communities that are in a dire state due to widespread pollution,  loss of land and resources, malnutrition, alcoholism and suicide.  In sum, the paradigm shift to “modernity” has created a void that threatens the Indigenous way of life, and the riches of knowledge it holds for all of humanity. Accelerating this rapid loss is that:<br/><br/><p>-
Access to Western healthcare is sporadic and poorly adapted to Indigenous
culture and ways of life. </p>
<p>-
Elders are dying without passing their knowledge onto the next generation.</p>
<p>-
The value system that harmonized the relationships between the individual,
the community and the environment is compromised. </p>
<p>- There is an erosion of trust among Indigenous people for the Western culture that has taken so much and given so little back, and bridges of important exchange are blocked. </p>
<p>To forcefully state it again, <b>we are on the verge of losing the Indigenous culture and its wisdom that opens the doors to wholistic concepts of health and the vast, life-sustaining plants of the rainforest</b>. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1027145/files/20141118144852-heritage-amazon-ecuador.jpg?1416350932"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

<p>Eighteen months ago, Sacha Warmi was a beautiful piece of land and a vision. Your carefully managed contributions have gone a long way to making Didier’s vision a living reality. Last year’s successful fundraising campaigns drew donations from passionate contributors such as yourself, raising almost $25,000! 
These efforts helped Sacha Warmi Center open our doors and initiate our first programs as an informational resource and educational center.

•  A medicinal plant nursery (next to the center)<br/>
•  A library providing educational reading and video material<br/>
•  A gift shop <br/>

Ecuadorian Amazon as the expression of the Sumak Kawsay, “Living well”. The
living testimony of the Amazonian cultures becomes the communicating strategy,

The
Amazon is the lung and heart of our planet, home of the world’s longest river and provider
of the largest collection of life-sustaining plants and diverse animal
species on earth. Amongst the 40,000 scientifically recorded plant species,
over 2,000 are known to have medicinal properties, useful in
treating human diseases, including cancer. Many have yet to be discovered. The
Amazon is also home to Indigenous ancestral medicinal knowledge that has played a critical role in the health of Indigenous communities. This knowledge, which includes the use of medicinal plants and related healing practices is disappearing at
an alarming rate.

Can
humanity risk losing this
knowledge?


Indigenous concepts of health and illness is wholistic in nature, encompassing all that is experienced by a human in relation to his or her surroundings, including activities, family, community, and the natural environment. For an illness to be  treated, the  healer will focus essentially on reestablishing the patient’s essential balance as much within himself as with his social group and the spiritual forces. To this, sacred plants play an essential role in healing the patient.
Due to myriad social, economic and political pressures, Indigenous peoples’ separation from their traditional health practices is having a devastating impact. The pressures of modern development have degraded environmental and cultural support systems. The impact of this loss is widely felt throughout Indigenous communities that are in a dire state due to widespread pollution,  loss of land and resources, malnutrition, alcoholism and suicide.  In sum, the paradigm shift to “modernity” has created a void that threatens the Indigenous way of life, and the riches of knowledge it holds for all of humanity. Accelerating this rapid loss is that:-
Access to Western healthcare is sporadic and poorly adapted to Indigenous
culture and ways of life. 
-
Elders are dying without passing their knowledge onto the next generation.
-
The value system that harmonized the relationships between the individual,
the community and the environment is compromised. 
- There is an erosion of trust among Indigenous people for the Western culture that has taken so much and given so little back, and bridges of important exchange are blocked. 
To forcefully state it again, we are on the verge of losing the Indigenous culture and its wisdom that opens the doors to wholistic concepts of health and the vast, life-sustaining plants of the rainforest. 
If We Act Now, A Different Story Is Possible

Sacha Warmi Center exists and serves to contribute to the preservation and renewal of Indigenous medicine, and for creating intercultural dialogue that will directly benefit Amazonian communities and Western understanding of Indigenous health systems and healing practices. 
These goals are furthered by: 

- Reacquainting Indigenous communities with their health and  medicinal traditions.
- 
Creating opportunities for intercultural dialogue between Indigenous and Western medical practitioners, that sensitizes both to each other’s important technologies and healthcare practices.
- Creating socioeconomic opportunities that will foster Indigenous pride in their traditions and preserve their natural resources.


A
30 Year Journey

As founder of Sacha Warmi Center, Didier Lacaze’s vision to preserve and support the reclamation of Indigenous knowledge among its rightful peoples and advance healthcare the world over, is the culmination of a lifetime of work.
For 30 years. Didier Lacaze has worked among with Peruvian and Ecuadorian Indigenous communities. He has authored scientific articles and books. He is a frequent lecturer, and consultant to governmental health agencies on matters related to Indigenous health and medicinal plants.YOUR DONATION AT WORK!
Eighteen months ago, Sacha Warmi was a beautiful piece of land and a vision. Your carefully managed contributions have gone a long way to making Didier’s vision a living reality. Last year’s successful fundraising campaigns drew donations from passionate contributors such as yourself, raising almost $25,000! 
These efforts helped Sacha Warmi Center open our doors and initiate our first programs as an informational resource and educational center.  The center and our programs have reached deeply and affected many. Already our programs have fostered interest not only among surrounding Indigenous communities, but also with Ecuadorian healthcare governmental agencies and foreign-based organizations that share our values and mission. 
The response to the inception of Sacha Warmi Center amongst Indigenous communities has been tremendous. The most rewarding outcome has been the strong response from Indigenous communities to our Mingas (traditional communal gatherings in which people give a hand), workshops and lectures with the participation of over 150 adults and children. 
2014 Construction and Maintenance Projects have included: 
- 
Volunteer house
- 
Plant Processing
- 
Maloca/Medicine House
- 
Medicinal Garden
- 
Pedagogical Garden
- 
Main entrance and parking area for visitors
- 
Water pond
All activities have targeted and benefited local Indigenous communities, children, women and men. They included:Five  educational and training workshops on
medicinal plants, Intercultural health, essential oil and floral water extraction,
natural soap making.Three pedagogical visits from secondary and
elementary school children.Health consultations: different therapies
offered like massage, osteopathy, naturopathy. Outreach: promotional visits to surrounding
Kichwa, Shuar and Secoya communities and local schools.Our plant processing facility is up and running, and training has already allowed us to loan one distillation unit to a nearby village.  Plants from our gardens are allowing us to produce essential oils and floral waters,  the sale of which helps us with our operational expenses, and serves as a commercial model for Indigenous people. 12 volunteers from Ecuador, USA, France,
Switzerland and Italy nurtured us with their energy and expertise, adding much value to  the development of our programs and projects. We want to take this opportunity to thank them and express our gratitude for their contribution In 2014, we also hosted visiting students from Universidad de Guaranda  and  the University of Tennessee,  Indigenous leaders, members of local government institutions, and health professionals.Reciprocity and sustainability underscore  our every endeavor. In 2014 -  
We signed a covenant signed with Ecuadorian foundation –Fundaciòn Ambiente y Sociedad (FAS) allowing Sacha Warmi Center to gain non-profit institutional status.
We entered in an agreement with Runa Foundation for exchange
between volunteer’s programs. Runa Foundation is the non-profit branch of Runa Clean Energy, the maker of Ecuadorian guyausa tea beverage.
We began working with a US-based herbal
companies for possible joint projects to support local populations in plant
cultivation and or sustainable commercial extraction. There is a strong possibility Sacha Warmi Center will become a designated center of reference by the Ecuadorian health governmental agency.Now Is The Time To Step Forward
Our momentum is formidable, and so is our challenge to become fully operational! Our 2015 goal is to complete construction of two main structures critical to serving our stakeholders, and substantiate the many opportunities ahead of us.

This is the place where all visitors will make their first stop, learning about SWC’s vision and mission. From here they will begin their guided visit. Features of the Interpretive center include: 
•  A medicinal plant nursery (next to the center)
•  A library providing educational reading and video material
•  A gift shop 
 
For the time being, the Interpretative center will  also serve as our learning center, where we will conduct workshops on different subjects relating to intercultural healthcare, and how Indigenous people can grow and process plants into marketable products, leading to economic sustainability.
Your generous donation will also go to support our Training Program for Intercultural Health Leaders and to hire a full time assistant, freeing up Didier's time so he can focus on managing the center, teaching and  hosting  visits by Indigenous communities. Our Gift To YouAs a heartfelt thank you for your generosity, we have selected some great gifts for each level of donation. All of the items have been  crafted or produced in the surrounding Indigenous communities or at the Sacha Warmi Center. Owning one of these artisan gifts will bring the spirit of the Amazon into your life, and will remind you of your contribution to preserving and revitalizing Amazonian culture, wisdom and its natural resources.Other Ways You Can Help ... Every Little Bit CountsIf you are a student or simply do not have the means to contribute, but are inspired by our project, there are many ways you can help.
Most pressing would be for you to spread this campaign as wide and as far as you can possibly send it.  Share it with your friends on social media, tell your co-workers, family, friends. Make some noise about this campaign.  It means so much to so many!

Miguel Alexiades Senior Lecturer
in Ethnobotany and Conservation, School of Anthropology and Conservation,
University of Kent, Canterbury, Kent, UK. Email: malexiades@gmail.com The Sacha Warmi Center grows out of the unique lifetime experience and
remarkable dedication of Didier Lacaze to the closely interrelated issues of
Amazonian health and well-being, traditional medicine and human-environment
interactions. Its strategic location, purpose and ethos all reflect a deep
commitment and sophisticated understanding of the challenges and opportunities
of intercultural exchange and dialogue as a process through which to generate
the kinds of knowledge, skills and pedagogy that is needed to face today's
acute socio-environmental crisis in today's multi-cultural, post-colonial
Amazonia.

Sacha Warmi
Center offers an opportunity to the local population, be it indigenous or
non-indigenous, to access another way to approach health and healing. It is
about re-creating, re-learning, remember what was always in our memory… This is
the medicine of the future. The Sacha Warmi Center is a Project with a vision
of humanity; a place where this vision is being created.

Soc. Kati Alvarez Msc. en Ciencias Sociales con

One of the challenges and
conscious contributions of the Sacha Warmi Center is to seek the confluence
between the recognition and the construction of Ecuador as a plurinational and
intercultural country through its integral approach to health and healthcare.
The knowledge and experience of Rosa Canelos and Didier Lacaze point to the
cosmological and epistemological conceptions and health practices in the
Ecuadorian Amazon as the expression of the Sumak Kawsay, “Living well”. The
living testimony of the Amazonian cultures becomes the communicating strategy,
for harmonious and complementary teaching and apprenticeship to build interculturality
through a horizontal dialogue, where the understanding of traditional medical
systems converge for the benefit of indigenous nations, peoples, and Ecuadorian society as
a whole.Robert Weisz,

Sacha Warmi is a
place, a project, and a vision of a land-based, traditional relationship
between humans and plants and healing.The Indigenous tradition of deep
connection with nature and a conscious, skillful relationship with medicinal
plants is fast disappearing in the Amazonian rainforest. Sacha Warmi is an
effort to revive and to renew the traditional model of a sustainable way of
cultivating medicinal plants and the preparation and use of those plants for
health and healing in indigenous communities. Sacha Warmi is a model and a
resource for indigenous people, for healers, for herbalists, and for all those
who would learn how to live and work with plant medicines, which are our gift
and our legacy from Nature. SachaWarmi represents an organic, sustainable, and
accessible model for restoring and improving the traditional approach to
wellness and health care among indigenous people.

I am
pleased to be associated with the Sacha Warmi Center, because of its sustained
engagements with local communities in ways that show an understanding of the
actual challenges that Amazonian local peoples face today. Its founder, Didier
Lacaze, has a long and positive history of commitment to indigenous health
practices and education throughout the Amazon. I am all too familiar with large
scale projects that develop a bureaucracy that, in turn, needs to be sustained
as its primary goal. I am strongly assured that the Sacha Warmi Center uses its
knowledge and resources in impacting and sustainable ways.

Emphasizing the
time-honored relationship between people and plants, the Sacha Warmi Center
offers a comprehensive, land-based model/resource for education, health care
and healing.  Having spent over three decades working with Indigenous
communities in Peru and Ecuador, Didier Lacaze brings his rich life experience,
dedication, and uncommon integrity to this vision.  With our life on this
precious Planet Earth increasingly threatened, the preservation of traditional
wisdom offers both guidance and hope for our future.
U.S.-based Indiegogo Support Team 
Most of the activities supporting Sacha Warmi Center would not be possible without the time and talents generously contributed by an international group of volunteers and friends. We thank the many who have joined us over the years, and make special mention of those currently sharing their talents in supporting our current public relations and fundraising needs.Marc ThibaultEntrepreneur and ExplorerEmail: marc@green-age.orgI am grateful to have been offered the opportunity to join and assist Didier Lacaze in the realization of his vision. I am confident in the years to come, we'll look back at these endeavors and realize their contribution to preserve and enhance our collective knowledge as well as our relationships with everything there is.

My commitment of support for SWC came forth out of the core of my being, knowing that it will produce important outcomes for the benefit of the Amazonian people and the future of medicine. The very existence of the Sacha Warmi Center creates a healing that is beneficial  for all people and the planet.Kirsten Kairos (KK) Sound, Movement & Holotropic Breathwork™ Facilitator, Voice Over Artist, Global Volunteer, and Yin ActivistEmail: kk@ZoBinaPori.com

Didier Lacaze is one
among a select few I have found to walk a path of such dedication and
integrity. I am so moved by his passion for the honoring and active support of
indigenous cultures in Ecuadorian Amazonia.

The Impact



Everyday someone reaches out to me in some way or another whether to show support or to inquire as to what I am ""ON"" or what I am doing. This campaign #100PoundRebirth and the #IsaBodyChallenge are both vehicles to reach the masses with the universal message of self-love and self-determination, through which we can make decisions to change our circumstances by taking ""massive"" action.   I know in my heart that by being open and sharing what I've learned,  I will inspire others to know that they can live through what I have lived through!

This Campaign is critical because at this point I do not have the financial resources to pay for products and continue with the program to qualify for the challenge. Using Isagenix products is a requirement for the #IsaBodyChallenge. This campaign will enable me to secure those products.



What We Need & What You Get
Every dime of the money raised in this campaign will go towards the purchase of Isagenix products (and shipping).  My regimen includes Shakes, IsaPro Whey Protein, Snacks, Cleanse for Life formula and Vitamins for a 30 Day period.  The campaign goal is to fund the cost of these products for the 4-months leading up to the challenge.  If I reach my entire goal, I will buy all of my products at once.  In this way I will be certain to have the products required to continue throughout the #IsaBodyChallenge. 

I have followed this program for well over 125 days and my body is transforming before my eyes... You can see my progress through my video diary on my youtube channel www.youtube.com/100PoundRebirth  I am able to keep everyone informed on my progress and provide insight into my daily process

As a show of appreciation, donations of $50 or more will receive an exclusive 100 Pound Rebirth at the end of my campaign ...

Other Ways You Can Help
There is strength in numbers!  Please help me get the word out and drum up support for my campaign.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>How can titanium be elastic? The secret behind KEEGO’s functionality lies within the ground-breaking production process, which allows us to add an elastic core to a titanium bottle. The key is to accurately control the fusion process in order to modulate the elasticity according to the amount of stress in different parts of the squeeze bottle. By the way: The Danish company mastering this process is renowned for producing accelerator parts for CERN and other accelerators around the world.</p>

<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p>KEEGO has come a long way: We have a functioning prototype, the contracts with our manufacturers are sewn up and there is a clear and reliable plan for what's coming. Of course, one has to be aware that the production process of a KEEGO bottle is highly scientific and involves dealing with very small tolerances and a lot of variables. So, upscaling the production will come with a lot of challenges. Since we are not willing to sacrifice product quality for quick results, this may result in a delay of the final delivery. But thanks to our highly professional production partners we are convinced the world's first squeezable metal bottle will be delivered to you without any shortcomings.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3> <p></p>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>At age 43, I had double hip replacements due to congenital hip dysplasia.  As an athlete competing in sports throughout my life, including 
wrestling in college, I have always been a fitness enthusiast.  The 5 years prior to my hip replacement surgeries were enormously painful on my 
joints due to lack of mobility.  My desire to “get 
back in the game” and find a complete fitness solution was what ultimately inspired this product.   My vision of creating a universal piece of fitness equipment that INTEGRATED stretching with a full-body workout came to fruition with our invention of the XFlex360.  </p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In addition to XFlex Fitness, I am the Owner and CEO of Saletta Leadership, a consulting, training, and speaking
company dedicated to leadership, sales, and strategy.   The companies that I have owned have trained more than 10,000 organizations around the world directly impacting more than 250,000 individuals.    </span></p>
<p>My partners, James and Christopher Mortensen, are the engineering masterminds behind the patented XFlex360 design.  James Mortensen is a genius engineer and 3D Graphic Designer that relentlessly pursued structural and artistic perfection on this project.  His son, Christopher Mortensen is also a master engineer and expert welder, as well as a production specialist.  Together they created a versatile, space-saving, collapsible, and expandable (18 accessories and growing) piece of fitness equipment that is unparalleled in the workout world.  </p>

In addition to XFlex Fitness, I am the Owner and CEO of Saletta Leadership, a consulting, training, and speaking

My partners, James and Christopher Mortensen, are the engineering masterminds behind the patented XFlex360 design.  James Mortensen is a genius engineer and 3D Graphic Designer that relentlessly pursued structural and artistic perfection on this project.  His son, Christopher Mortensen is also a master engineer and expert welder, as well as a production specialist.  Together they created a versatile, space-saving, collapsible, and expandable (18 accessories and growing) piece of fitness equipment that is unparalleled in the workout world.  

But please don't just take our word for it... Here is a leading authority on the design and real marketability of fitness equipment.  Colleen Szot is touted as one of the top informercial writers in the world.  She wrote informercials for wildly successful products like NordicTrack and the George Foreman Grill.  Here are her words:

Thank you all for your support/love/prayers
 
 (10-10-2012) Blake will start a new chemo medicine that is very harsh and try to kill the cancer cells in the brain. Chemo in the brain does not mix since the brains job is to fight off everything. Only certain chemo meds can~ so please pray that he can at least be comfortable today♥ thank you
 
 (10-11-2012) Baby Blakes Cancer Cells are spreading RAPIDLY... PLEASE PRAY
 
(10-15-2012) His Mom, Natalie Moore-Arnold said he had a good day yesterday and they cherished it....
He was able to drink 1/2 oz of water (hasn't been able to swallow) and was excited to do so. Also, Blake loves listening to music and watching baby Einstein. He is still fighting hard. If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer. Matthew 21:22

<p>Through our own personal experiences and those around us, we have noticed that many people lack the awareness of the way alcohol impacts the body. In order to alleviate this problem we have created the X-hale smartphone breathalyzer, an easy to use and versatile unit that gives the power of knowledge and awareness to its users. X-hale is perfect for a night out at the clubs, happy hour after a long day, or even a night at home with friends.</p>
<p>The X-hale breathalyzer has a sleek design that makes it appealing to all audiences and the range of available colors makes it perfect for any lifestyle. X-hale comes in Arctic White, Cobalt Blue, Midnight Black, or Fierce Orange (Limited Edition). Along with the unit, our Indiegogo backers will receive a carrying case that can be easily attached to a key-chain, or stowed away in a pocket or purse. </p>
<p>Although we have a working prototype, a finalized design, and a production channel ready; we need your support to fund our initial production run. With the money we receive from our Indiegogo campaign, we will invest in a production run that will not only help us fulfill the Indiegogo rewards but also give us the necessary capital to produce further units for sale to the general public. Our goal is to get X-hale breathalyzers in every adult's hands to ensure that everyone makes smarter drinking decisions. </p>

many of you already know almost 3 years ago in her mid-20s Mona was diagnosed
with Acute Lymphoblastic <b>Leukemia</b> type T. Since then, she has
been defeating, struggling and overcome by this disease and is now urgently in
need of a bone-marrow transplant. She has received most of her treatment in
Cairo, Egypt but is now receiving treatment in London, England because the
necessary drugs are not available in Cairo. Soon, we hope, she will be
receiving a transplant. She has no matches in her family, and so the type of
procedure she has to undergo can only be performed abroad (Egypt does not do
the transplant for unrelated donors). There is no insurance to cover these
costs so her family has been funding this through personal savings and grants.</span></p><p></p><p></p>

for her treatment, and make this journey a little less over-whelming.</span><b style=""background-color: white;""><span style=""font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: Helvetica;""></span></b></p><p><b style=""background-color: white;""> </b></p><p></p>

If you prefer to contribute through a bank transfer directly to the hospital (especially for larger amounts), please email me at ruwayna@gmail.com and I can provide you with the account info.-------------------Hello
friends, friends of friends and strangers. My name is Ruwayna and I am
launching this campaign to help raise funds for a life-saving bone
marrow transplant for my friend Mona Abulhassan. 
 
As
many of you already know almost 3 years ago in her mid-20s Mona was diagnosed
with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia type T. Since then, she has
been defeating, struggling and overcome by this disease and is now urgently in
need of a bone-marrow transplant. She has received most of her treatment in
Cairo, Egypt but is now receiving treatment in London, England because the
necessary drugs are not available in Cairo. Soon, we hope, she will be
receiving a transplant. She has no matches in her family, and so the type of
procedure she has to undergo can only be performed abroad (Egypt does not do
the transplant for unrelated donors). There is no insurance to cover these
costs so her family has been funding this through personal savings and grants.
 
Medical
costs are constantly building up and after almost 3 years of treatment, you can
imagine what kinds of hurdles those costs have become. I think that as a global
community: Egypt, the Gulf, North America, Europe, Asia, perhaps even some of you
down-under; we can help Mona and her family keep up with the finances necessary
for her treatment, and make this journey a little less over-whelming. 
What We Need
Please
send what you can, all you need is a credit card and a few minutes. Whether
it's 20$, or 20,000$, I assure you it all adds up. You can also send money by bank transfer directly to the hospital in England. Email me at ruwayna@gmail.com for the account info.
 
These
are the costs that need to be covered: 
1-
 10,000GBP ($15,800) This is the amount necessary in the next few
days / weeks to cover a recent hospitalisation expense for an infection that
has fortunately been cured.
2-
 50,000GBP ($79,000) This amount is needed to cover the latest
chemotherapy costs.
The
transplant costs more than this, over 100,000 British pounds, but some of the
costs have already been collected and I have decided to start with these
immediate goals first.
 
These
kinds of figures seemed huge to me when I first heard them, but I have
discovered over the last few months through other fund-raising initiatives that
anything is possible. So this website is only one of multiple avenues for
fundraising, there are others. For now, let's reach the first goal of 15,800$

نحن مجموعة من الأصدقاء نحاول جمع تبرعات لتغطية تكاليف عملية زرع نخاع لصديقتنا منى ابو الحسن. منى اصيبت  بمرض اللوكيميا (سرطان الدم) الليمافاوية الحادة منذ ٣ سنوات و منذ هذا الحين و هى تحاول التخلص من هذا المرض عن طريق العلاجات المختلفة. يرى الأطباء أن المرحلة الأتية اللازمة لعلاجها هو تلقيها عملية زرع نخاع  و لكن هذه العملية مكلفة للغاية  مع العلم أن تكاليف المستشفى و العلاج الكيماوى ، التى إضطرت منى أن تتلقاه بإنجلترا لعدم توفر ما تحتاجه فى مصر، قد وضعت عبئ رهيب على عائلة منى فى غياب أى تآمين طبى ومع الإْعتماد على المدخرات التى اوشكت علي النفاذ.
نحن على أمل فى أننا نستطيع جميعاَ كمجتمع عالمى أن نساعد منى و عائلتها على تغطية النفقات اللازمة للعلاج والشفاء من هذا المرض إن شاء الله..
كل مساهمة ، مهما صغر أو كبر حجمها، ستقربنا من هدفنا أكثر و أكثر . كل ما تحتاجونه للتبرع  من خلال هذا الموقع هو كارت إئتمان ولكن يمكنكم أيضاَ التبرع عن طريق تحويل بنكى مباشر للمستشفى التى تتعالج بها منى فى إنجلترا. يمكنكم معرفة البيانات اللازمة للتحويل عن طريق إرسال بريد إليكترونى إلى 

: ruwayna@gmail.com
 النفقات التى نهدف إلى تغطيتها عن طريق التبرعات:

١. عشرة ألاف جنيه إسترلينى (١٥،٨٠٠ دولار). هذه أكثر النفقات إلحاحاَ و تمثل تكلفة إدخال منى المستشفى لعلاجها من عدوى أصابتها مؤخراَ،  و التى نحن  شاكرون لشفائها منها. 
٢. خمسون ألف جنيه إسترلينى ) ٧٩،٠٠٠ دولار) و هذا لتغطية نفقات العلاج الكيماوىعملية زرع النخاع ستتكلف أكثر من مائة ألف جنيه إسترلينى و لكننا  قررنا أن نحقق الأهداف السابق ذكرها أولاَ مع العلم أن هذه الحملة إحدى الوسائل التى نقوم بها بجمع التبرعات اللازمةطرق اخرى للمساعدة:- إطلب من عائلتك، أصدقاءك أو زملائك بالعمل أن  يساهموا. يمكنك أنت أن تجمع التبرعات ثم ترسلها مجمعة بالنيابة عنهم -- إترك تعليق على الموقع، خاصة إذا كنت تعرف منى أو عائلتها بصفة شخصية -- إنشر هذه الحملة على  مواقع التواصل الإجتماعى آو عن طريق البريد الإلكترونى --  ruwayna@gmail.com إذا كانت لديك آفكار لطرق أخرى لجمع التبرعات، الرجاء مشاركتها على - إذا كنت فى مصر قم بزيارة صفحة حملة البحث عن متبرع نخاع ملائم لمنى -  https://www.facebook.com/ 
نبذة عن منى


نشأت منى بالدوحة، قطر، وعادت إلى مسقط رأسها، القاهرة، في
مرحلة المراهقة.  تخرجت من الجامعة بعدما
درست الفلسفة لكن انتهى بها الأمر، مثلها في ذلك مثل الكثير من خريجي القسم،
بالعمل في مجال آخر. ومع التجربة العملية، وجدت في نفسها ميلا  للإعلام والفنون البصرية. وقد بدأت بالعمل
لحساب شركة إنتاج بالقاهرة، ثم أصبحت منتجة حرة في مجالي الأخبار والأفلام
الوثائقية. ومع اكتسابها المزيد من الخبرة، تبينت لها حاجة الجمهور إلى مهارات
تحليل المواد والروايات الإعلامية . لذا شاركت بانتظام، بوصفها متطوعة وبروح دارسة
الفلسفة، في تنظيم وتيسير مشروعات تساعد 
الشباب على تكوين وعي نقدي إزاء المواد الإعلامية والبصرية 
إنكم بمساعدتكم لمنى على استرداد كامل عافيتها، تساندون اختا
وصديقة رائعة، وتساعدونها أيضا على مواصلة عملها هذا. نشكر لكم مساهمتكم ومساعدتكم

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hi!  This February, I am going to be starting a Kiva fellowship in Nairobi, Kenya and I need your help funding this unpaid volunteer fellowship.  Kiva is a non-profit organization whose mission is to connect people, through lending, for the sake of alleviating poverty.  To learn more about Kiva, check out <a href=""http://nessainkenya.wordpress.com/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://nessainkenya.wordpress.com/about/</a> and <span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><a href=""http://www.kiva.org/about"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.kiva.org/about</a>.  </span><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>For the next four months, I will be working with three of Kiva's field partners in Nairobi to help maximize Kiva's effectiveness and to increase the number of loans given out to students and entrepreneurs in Kenya.  I will be working with Strathmore University,  Faulu Kenya and SMEP.  My work with these three organizations will help to ensure that more Kenyans are able to attend university and that more entrepreneurs will be able to start or improve their businesses.  Support my fellowship and be a part of the microfinance solution!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>So, how did a girl from Queens, NY become interested in dedicating 4-12 months of her life to Kiva and microfinance?  Good question!  I first became interested in microfinance and the concepts of peer lending while volunteering with a program called Young Women Enterprising Women (YWEW) at the YWCA in downtown Pittsburgh while at Carnegie Mellon University.  YWEW gave low and middle income women the tools they needed to start their own businesses through an entrepreneurial class and access to a peer lending group.  Witnessing the empowerment that comes with increased access to credit, I became convinced that entrepreneurship and microfinance can enable any individual to improve their life.  It was not until I studied abroad in Uganda and Rwanda and learned more about microfinance that I saw its power for international development. <br/><br/><br/></p>
<p>After graduating from Carnegie Mellon University, I taught Pre-Kindergarten in Washington D.C. through Teach for America.  Living and teaching in D.C. secured my belief that knowledge is power.  A quality education can enable anyone, regardless of situation, to improve their life trajectory.  Knowledge and a quality education are not guarantees.  Kiva, through it's partnership with Strathmore University, hopes to increase the number of people who are able to receive a quality advanced degree by offering full tuition loans to students who otherwiscape would not have had the financial capability to attend university.  I am eager to witness the power of combining microfinance and education 
in Nairobi.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Knowledge and education are one key part of the puzzle that is opportunity; access to credit is the next piece of this puzzle.  Faulu and SMEP are traditional microfinance institutions which offer micro loans to clients who have traditionally been left out of the financial system.  I look forward to learning a great deal from all of the organizations I will be working with, while contributing my experience and training in order to increase their potential.   </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Will be Doing- My Impact</h3>
<p>While in Nairobi, I will be working with three different and amazing organizations.  For the majority of my fellowship, I will be working with Strathmore University.  Strathmore is Kiva's first non-traditional partner specializing in student loans.  I will be helping Strathmore launch their Kiva program in order to offer full-tuition loans to students.  These loans will enable Kenyans, who otherwise might not have the opportunity due to financial constraints, to attend university in Nairobi.  I will be an integral part of getting this much needed program off the ground and running in order to ensure more students have access to higher education.  [<a href=""http://www.strathmore.edu/News.php?NewsID=753"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.strathmore.edu/News.php?NewsID=753</a>] <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In addition, I will be working with Faulu Kenya to help them serve their 250,000 clients throughout Kenya.  While working with Faulu, I will be helping to continue the strong partnership Faulu has with Kiva by getting more of their clients on Kiva.org and increasing the information that lenders receive about Faulu's borrowers and their entrepreneurial successes.  Faulu's clients range from electronics saleswomen to farmers and Faulu provides loans and financial services to meet their needs.  [<a href=""http://www.kiva.org/partners/142"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.kiva.org/partners/142</a>]<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Lastly, I will also working with SMEP <font size=""3"">(</font><font size=""3"">Small and Micro Enterprise Programme), </font>whose main objective is to alleviate poverty by empowering those 
who are economically marginalized.  SMEP is one of the premier MFIs in Kenya.  SMEP's clients range from retail sales men and women to transportation providers.  I look forward to helping them best provide services to their clients and ensuring their borrowers' effective use of the loans they receive through Kiva.  [<a href=""http://www.kiva.org/partners/138"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.kiva.org/partners/138</a>] <br/></p>

<h3>What I Need and Where Your Money is Going<br/>
</h3>
<p>Funding a fellowship does not come cheap and Nairobi is one of the more expensive capital cities in sub-Saharan Africa.  Your donations will help me offset some of the costs of doing this. The cost of moving abroad and working on a volunteer basis are expansive and include such items as:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>- Airfare</p>
<p>-Vaccinations</p>
<p>-Anti-malarial drugs <br/></p>
<p>-Visas</p>
<p>-Research Materials</p>
<p>-Secure Accommodation</p>
<p>-Food</p>
<p>-Communication</p>
<p>-Transportation</p>
<p>-Apparel<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>An example of some of the costs of the fellowship in Nairobi include:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- $700-$1000 for a flight home from Nairobi [my flight to Nairobi and my
 round trip flight to San Francisco for training were purchased using 
generously donated miles]</p>
<p>- $400-$600 for a secure roof over my head for one month</p>
<p>-$100-$250 for vaccinations and anti-malarial drugs<br/></p>
<p>- $20-$35 a week for matatu buses and taxis to commute to and from work [only taxis are recommended to commute after dark]</p>
<p>- $100 entry visa into Kenya</p>
<p>- $30 approximate cost of cellphone minutes and internet cafes for one month</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>All funds raised towards my goal will be used to help lessen the personal financial burden of this fellowship.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Five Reasons Why You Should Donate to my Fellowship Funds<br/>
</h3>
<p>You may be asking yourself why you might want to donate to my fellowship, and I thought of a few pretty good reasons:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">I
 work very hard. </span> If you know me, you know that I am dedicated to the 
people I am working with and the organizations and causes I am working for. I truly 
believe in the transformative power microfinance holds in breaking the 
cycle of poverty; thus, I am driven to see the organizations I will be 
working with succeed.  If you don't know me, here's one example of my determination: In D.C. I taught 3,4 and five year old students everything from how to read, 
write, and count to how to use the bathroom and how to be good friends. If you have taught any of these things, you
 know how much relentless determination and patience goes into it. I 
will use these and all the skills I honed through teaching and past leadership experiences in order to 
deliver results for Kiva, Strathmore University, Faulu and SMEP in 
Nairobi.</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">This is</span> <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">a direct way for you to be involved with my 
fellowship</span> without having to personally deal with the occasional 
electricity shortage, bucket shower or <a class=""zem_slink"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_toilet"" rel=""wikipedia noopener nofollow"" title=""Pit toilet"">pit latrine</a>. You can live vicariously and safely through my blogging and know that your money helped make an impact.  <br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Transparency
 and Honesty</span>. There are many organizations out there working towards 
making the world a better, more just place but, when 
donating to these organizations, you may never know where your money is 
going, nor do you consistently get to see exactly what your hard earned 
dollars are being used for. I will be 
consistently documenting who your money is impacting through blogs, 
photos, and videos. Your money will go directly to the costs I incur 
through my fellowship.  It will only be used for my basic necessities, 
it will not be used for any additional travel or entertainment.  And if you have any 
questions, you know where to find me. [nessa.french@fellows.kiva.org]</li>

<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Incentives!</span>
 I myself am a sucker for incentives/prizes so, I thought of a few 
things to make fundraising a bit more interesting. [see right side panel]</li>

we raise will be helping fund youth homelessness through the Lighthouse

<p> </p></div>","Background
Every two weeks, the last fluent speaker of a language dies, and humanity loses another language. Nearly half of the world's languages are likely to vanish in the next 100 years. 
Over the last decade at Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages, we have worked with hundreds of people dedicated to endangered language documentation around the world. Through community collaboration, we have made some of the first-ever digital recordings of dozens of endangered languages, and we have traveled to many countries to train language activists in documentation techniques that can help preserve their cultural and linguistic legacy.
 
Papua New Guinea's Languages
The island nation of Papua New Guinea (PNG) represents the greatest single concentration of linguistic diversity on earth, with 830 listed languages identified thus far, and an unknown number remaining to be scientifically documented. 
Without PNG, no survey of the world's languages would be complete, nor would our understanding of the current global process of languages extinction. With so many of PNG's languages being undocumented and in danger of disappearing, now is the time to start creating recordings of these languages, and helping local activists and students to create materials that can preserve their languages for the future. 
 
Our Goal
Our goal is to teach a 4-day digital media skills workshop at the Papua New Guinea University of Technology (UNITECH) in which local indigenous students will learn how create new Talking Dictionaries for their own native languages. We have been invited by local scholars in Papua New Guinea to give this workshop later this year in October (2013), and we are raising the funds to make it happen. 
Our workshop is already partially funded thanks to grants and donors, and we need a further $2750 to help cover the rest of our equipment and travel costs. Over 50 different local languages are represented at UNITECH. We aim to create Talking Dictionaries for 12 languages to start with, and then return once a year for the next 4 years to continue building more dictionaries with the students.
This will be the 4th time we teach a digital skills workshop of this kind, and the first time in the Pacific. Check out pictures and write-ups from our previous workshops for speakers of endangered languages (organized in collaboration with National Geographic) held in Santa Fe, New Mexico (USA); Shillong, Meghalaya (Northeast India) and Santiago (Chile). 
 
What is a Talking Dictionary?
A Talking Dictionary takes the traditional paper dictionary to a whole new level. It is an interactive online tool that digitally preserves words and phrases, and it allows the user to hear high-quality audio recordings of words in their language, as well as record and upload new content. 
The tool is a powerful educational tool for communities that are trying to revitalize their endangered languages. The online dictionary is programmed to be bilingual so that speakers of the local dominant language can easily use it. It serves as a resource to help fluent speakers teach their native language to a new generation of speakers. 
Talking Dictionaries help create visibility for minority languages on the Web. They are a virtual space where speakers can go to listen to their language, no matter where they are in the world. Take a minute to check out our Talking Dictionary Portal, and our new site for the Talking Dictionaries of Latin America. 
 
Why We Can Make a Difference
At the Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages, we are a small and dynamic team with a low overhead. We coordinate big long-term projects, such as the Talking Dictionaries, on a modest budget. Supporting us is a great way to support the creation of tools that will preserve threatened languages for future generations of speakers. 
Thanks to a Talking Dictionary, you can listen to forms of human speech that you've never heard before, and get a further glimpse into the rich diversity of languages spoken on our planet. 
We have a good relationship with a number of communities in Papua New Guinea because we have done language documentation there in the past. Here are some images from our fieldwork in Papua New Guinea in 2009.

<h2>Kaiya Barber was born with Cerebral Palsy.</h2>
<p>Cerebral Palsy is a neurological disorder that affects a person's ability to ambulate and communicate. When Kaiya was born, the doctors said that Kaiya would never walk. In the past years, the Ramapo/Indian Hills High School community and their friends and families have banded together to raise money for Kaiya's treatments and therapies through donations, the Kaiya's Cup hockey game, and Kaiyapalooza. Kaiya's father, Ramapo High School math teacher and varsity coach Lee Barber, gives credit to the Ramapo/Indian Hills community for Kaiya's ability to walk, as the funds raised go to her ongoing therapy, including<em> Hippotherapy </em>(horseback therapy), which facilitates hip movement and ultimately the ability to walk.</p>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Every year, these fundraisers and events are even more successful than the year before, and this year shouldn't be an exception! Your donations, no matter the size, help to increase the quality of life of someone who serves as an inspiration for everyone. With the help of the community in the past, Kaiya was able to break free from her wheelchair and walk- now, with <em>your</em> help, Kaiya will be able to break even more barriers.</p>
<h3>Kaiyapalooza</h3>

<p>Kaiyapalooza is an annual event held in May that benefits Kaiya Barber. Food is served, there's a show, and there's raffle baskets, auction items and a 50/50! It's always a great time, so we'd love to see you there. The date for the event is May 22, 2013 at 7:00 p.m.</p>

<h3>Mike's Broken Hand</h3>
<p>My name is Travis and i have been a good friend of Mike Childress for over 20 years now. Mike had a horrific accident at work which resulted in getting multiple fingers in his hand broken. (Look in the picture gallery to see the wound..ITS BAAADDDDDD)  Mike is a metal worker who creates art work with his hands. He was helping move a metal cabinet that weighed several hundred pounds when it dropped onto his hand, at this point he cant remember anything else because he blacked out. The next thing he knew, he woke up in a hospital. </p>
<p>My goal is to raise $10,000 to help with his expenses and bills that are piling up because of this injury. Most of his hospital bills are covered but he is building up some debt because of this injury.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>I want to raise $10,000 for him.</h3>
<p>This money raised will all go directly to Mike, it will help with his bills piling up and pay for more rehabilitaion for his hand.</p>
<p>I did a similiar fund raiser for Yoshi's broken foot and he can vouch that he received all the money contributed. We raised almost $1000 for Yoshi and im hoping we can raise even more for Mike.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Magic Hand's</h3>
<p>Getting Mikes hand back to 100% is of the utmost importance because of all the positive things his hands contribute to the community. He volunteers his time and expertise building skateparks in the Seattle area, and God damnit, he is a damned handsome fellow who needs his handsome hand back!</p>

<p>On July 14th, 2012, our friend, brother, and son Marco Lira suffered a severe brain injury. He’s currently in the best possible care with both amazing doctors and an incredible amount of positivity coming from family and friends surrounding him.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he does not have health insurance. Great care costs a great deal of money, and that’s where we need you.</p>
<p>His father Aurelio, mother Susana, and brothers Danny and Fernando are some of the warmest and most welcoming people any of us have ever met. Few among us haven't immediately become a member of their ever-growing extended family. They’ve <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">never</span> hesitated to open their home, help anyone in need, and have ALWAYS made everyone feel like part of the family.</p>
<p>Now it’s time we return that favor and help them in their time of need </p>
<p>To many of us Marco has been an inspiration- his art, music, and love of life have inspired countless numbers of us. Year and after year, whether through music or art, Marco has continuously blessed us with his talent, pushing us to explore our own. Rare is a talent like Marco’s, which encompasses so many disciplines- and rarer is a talent that brings out the best in those that are lucky enough to simply be there to experience it. As the weeks go by, we will be sharing samples of Marco’s staggering genius- and as always, beautiful glimpses into the heart and mind of person that we love so much. </p>
<p>Marco has a huge emotional support system, but love won't cover his mounting hospital bills. The earliest prognosis has him in the hospital for weeks upon weeks, possibly months. As you know, medical care under such circumstances can reach astronomical heights. For those who have been asking what they can do to help, we ask that you give anything you can to relieve the burden of his current and coming medical expenses. Anything helps. Literally…anything. </p>
<p>You might ask, how can I give?</p>
<p>We have set up this Indiegogo account as means to help raise funds for his medical bills. Indiegogo is a crowd funding website that allows regular people to set up campaigns to raise funds for a cause...Our cause is our friend Marco.</p>
<p>By giving through Indiegogo, and helping the campaign meet and exceed its goal, you are in no small way coming to the aid of a person and family who has given us so much through his music, art, and friendship- let's all pitch in and give him something back. </p>
<p>Finally, we also ask that you, his friends and family, share here your stories and memories that you have experienced alongside Marco, for us all to enjoy and find comfort in.</p>
<p>All proceeds will go directly to Marco and his family.</p>

<p>El 14 de Julio del 2012 nuestro querido amigo, hermano, e hijo Marco Lira tuvo un accidente y sufrio un fuerte daño cerebral. Actualmente  él esta bajo los mejores cuidados con buenos doctores y con un apoyo increible de su familia y amigos.</p>
<p>Desafortunadamente él no tiene aseguranza y los mejores cuidados requieren de mucho dinero. Aquí es cuando necesitamos de ustedes.</p>
<p>Su papá Aurelio, mamá Susana y hermanos Danny y Fernando son de las personas más buenas y acogedoras que hemos conocido Todos hemos sido bienvenidos a su hogar y nos han convertido en miembros de su familia. Ellos siempre nos han abierto las puertas de su hogar, han ayudado a cualquiera que lo necesite, y SIEMPRE han hecho sentir a todos como parte de su familia.</p>
<p>Ahora es tiempo de devolverles el favor y ayudarlos en estos momentos que más nos necesitan.</p>

On July 14th, 2012, our friend, brother, and son Marco Lira suffered a severe brain injury. He’s currently in the best possible care with both amazing doctors and an incredible amount of positivity coming from family and friends surrounding him.
Unfortunately, he does not have health insurance. Great care costs a great deal of money, and that’s where we need you.
His father Aurelio, mother Susana, and brothers Danny and Fernando are some of the warmest and most welcoming people any of us have ever met. Few among us haven't immediately become a member of their ever-growing extended family. They’ve never hesitated to open their home, help anyone in need, and have ALWAYS made everyone feel like part of the family.
Now it’s time we return that favor and help them in their time of need 
To many of us Marco has been an inspiration- his art, music, and love of life have inspired countless numbers of us. Year and after year, whether through music or art, Marco has continuously blessed us with his talent, pushing us to explore our own. Rare is a talent like Marco’s, which encompasses so many disciplines- and rarer is a talent that brings out the best in those that are lucky enough to simply be there to experience it. As the weeks go by, we will be sharing samples of Marco’s staggering genius- and as always, beautiful glimpses into the heart and mind of person that we love so much. 
Marco has a huge emotional support system, but love won't cover his mounting hospital bills. The earliest prognosis has him in the hospital for weeks upon weeks, possibly months. As you know, medical care under such circumstances can reach astronomical heights. For those who have been asking what they can do to help, we ask that you give anything you can to relieve the burden of his current and coming medical expenses. Anything helps. Literally…anything. 
You might ask, how can I give?
We have set up this Indiegogo account as means to help raise funds for his medical bills. Indiegogo is a crowd funding website that allows regular people to set up campaigns to raise funds for a cause...Our cause is our friend Marco.
By giving through Indiegogo, and helping the campaign meet and exceed its goal, you are in no small way coming to the aid of a person and family who has given us so much through his music, art, and friendship- let's all pitch in and give him something back. 
Finally, we also ask that you, his friends and family, share here your stories and memories that you have experienced alongside Marco, for us all to enjoy and find comfort in.
All proceeds will go directly to Marco and his family.
 

If you decide to donate - please let people know. Use this as your profile picture on Facebook to get the word out.

El 14 de Julio del 2012 nuestro querido amigo, hermano, e hijo Marco Lira tuvo un accidente y sufrio un fuerte daño cerebral. Actualmente  él esta bajo los mejores cuidados con buenos doctores y con un apoyo increible de su familia y amigos.
Desafortunadamente él no tiene aseguranza y los mejores cuidados requieren de mucho dinero. Aquí es cuando necesitamos de ustedes.
Su papá Aurelio, mamá Susana y hermanos Danny y Fernando son de las personas más buenas y acogedoras que hemos conocido Todos hemos sido bienvenidos a su hogar y nos han convertido en miembros de su familia. Ellos siempre nos han abierto las puertas de su hogar, han ayudado a cualquiera que lo necesite, y SIEMPRE han hecho sentir a todos como parte de su familia.
Ahora es tiempo de devolverles el favor y ayudarlos en estos momentos que más nos necesitan.

<h3>Help us for a safe patient journey</h3>
<p>The shortest way for patients from Matibi Mission Hospital to the next bigger hospital with emergency surgery takes more than two hours. The new ambulance though is adequate for the bad roads but there is still no patient bed and no nurse stand in the canopy. </p>
<p>In May 2012, we, the friends of Matibi, a Swiss based association to support the local hospital in Matibi, raised enough funds to buy a new Toyota Hilux 4x4 planned to be extended as an ambulance. In fall 2012, the hospital built a canopy on top of the pick-up and painted the car to be recognisable as ambulance. Now, we are looking for fundings for the next extensions: a patient bed and a nurse stand. </p>
<p>Matibi Mission Hospital is the main medical venue for more than 20'000 people living around Matibi, a village in the south of Simbabwe. The 125 hospital bed are divided in differnent wards like maternity, men, and children. Every day, more than 40 patient are treated in the outpatient department. in the home based care programm, more than 300 patients are provided with anti-AIDS-medicines. For surgery the patients have to transferred to the Masvingo Province Hospital, more than two hours away, a long and stressful journey. </p>
<p>The association Friends for Matibi supports the hospital with doctor's top-up, drugs, equipment like cd4 machine, anasthetic machine, x-ray films, and infrastructure development like solar panels, borehole pumps for drinking water, fridges and more.

I was hospitalized 3 months straight, had 3 surgeries on my neck, one of which involved screws being placed in my spine, then got diagnosed with lymphoma. The problem is that i live in a country with a poor health system, which doesn't cover certain expenses - i have to pay for the screws and and doctors are corrupt, they literally ask you a fee to do a proper job on you - a thing which has now came to bite me . I have been living with a cervical collar for the past 6 months, because the surgery on my spine is incomplete, because i could not afford it. I need a certain prosthetic and more titanium screws from what they've told me. And it keeps getting worse and worse - maybe because of the chemotherapy that i have to go through, or because the surgery is incomplete, one of my vertebrae is now exposed and my back has since then started to become more and more numb and stiff. The doctor's where i had surgery won't see me, saying all sorts of pretenses and i cannot afford a private surgeon to see me, a consultation alone costing 100$, I have been avoiding this because it is a lot of money, and when i think about it, i start doubting that i am worth it and that i will ever get better; the surgery costs about 7,000$ at a city hospital and at least 20,000$ at a private clinic. I added the private clinic option because of the way i have been treated by the surgeons at the hospital; as if they don't care if i live or die, they just want their paycheck.</p><p>    I apologize for the possibly robotic or rushed feel of my case, truth be told, i never imagined going through so much in such a short time, it would take me pages and pages to retell everything, it all feels so unreal that it keeps me up at night, crying and wishing i would stop breathing.

<h3>We need your help!</h3>
<p>Meet the Kinney Family from the lovely little town of Pittsboro, NC (population 2000).  </p>
<p>Both the husband (Phillip) and wife (Cassie) manage the local Andy's Hamburger shop.  As members of the community, they have often held fundraisers at Andy's for local charities and for others in need. </p>
<p>Phillip was recently diagnosed with Stage 4 Hodgkins disease and started chemotherapy on July 11th.  Phillip is 28 years old.</p>
<p>Phillip and Cassie have 2 small children ages 2 and 4.</p>
<p>They have no medical insurance.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Their home is falling apart!</h3>
<p>The Kinney family currently lives in a 30 year old single-wide mobile home with two small bedrooms.  Their electric bill alone is $400 each month.  With outside temperatures soaring to over 100 degrees they cannot keep the trailer comfortable for someone going through such intensive treatment.</p>
<p>They need to move into a better living arrangement for their family in Pittsboro.</p>
<p>We are raising funds to help them get moved and established in a better rental home.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Battle Ahead</h3>
<p>Phillip will be undergoing chemotherapy for an extended period of time and will not be able to work.  After the chemotherapy is done, the doctors will assess the prognosis to determine if a bone marrow transplant will be needed to increase his survival odds.</p>

Meet the Kinney Family from the lovely little town of Pittsboro, NC (population 2000).  
Both the husband (Phillip) and wife (Cassie) manage the local Andy's Hamburger shop.  As members of the community, they have often held fundraisers at Andy's for local charities and for others in need. 
Phillip was recently diagnosed with Stage 4 Hodgkins disease and started chemotherapy on July 11th.  Phillip is 28 years old.
Phillip and Cassie have 2 small children ages 2 and 4.
They have no medical insurance.


Their home is falling apart!
The Kinney family currently lives in a 30 year old single-wide mobile home with two small bedrooms.  Their electric bill alone is $400 each month.  With outside temperatures soaring to over 100 degrees they cannot keep the trailer comfortable for someone going through such intensive treatment.
They need to move into a better living arrangement for their family in Pittsboro.
We are raising funds to help them get moved and established in a better rental home.


The Battle Ahead
Phillip will be undergoing chemotherapy for an extended period of time and will not be able to work.  After the chemotherapy is done, the doctors will assess the prognosis to determine if a bone marrow transplant will be needed to increase his survival odds.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>My name is <strong>Jack W. Cooper</strong>. I am a 42 year transgender man who lives in Philadelphia Pennsylvania. On Wednesday, August 14, 2013, I am scheduled to undergo the ultra important next step in my transitional journey, <strong>a surgical procedure that will provide me with a beautiful, hand-crafted, male chest.</strong></p>
<p>It had been my hope that this surgery, which is integral to aligning my gender identity with the body that I will spend the rest of my life in, would be covered by health insurance; however, despite the admirable efforts of my loving fiancé J.D Ackerman (Thank you Sweet Pea!), who has been my tireless champion in the process of making this dream a reality, <strong>we were unable to guarantee coverage. </strong></p>
<p>Rather than despair over this unfortunate disappointment, J.D and I chatted about alternate solutions, and <strong>we decided to</strong> <strong>put together an indiegogo campaign to raise the funds for the procedure with the help of our community</strong>. By donating whatever amount you can afford, or if you cannot afford to donate, by simply sharing this page with folks who might be interested in helping out, <strong>you will be enabling me to achieve something that I have wanted and needed for a very long time.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Journey So Far</strong></p>
<p>I was born and raised in Texas. Growing up, I was most definitely aware that I was different from the kids around me; however, I did not have a name for how I was different until I moved to Philly about fifteen years ago. Shortly after arriving in the city, I was introduced to a few trans* folks and their allies, who had started a grassroots organization called THAC (Transgender Health Action Coalition). I became a volunteer for the group, and<strong> through my involvement, I got in touch with the fact that I was transgender.</strong></p>
<p>As a result of that realization, I began to transition socially by telling my closest friends, requesting that they call me Cooper, rather than the first or middle names that I had been given at birth, and asking them to refer to me with male gender pronouns.<strong> Though these steps were pivotal to affirming my identity, I was unable to move beyond that point for many years, due to my struggle with an addiction to alcohol.</strong></p>
<p>On October 24, 2005, I got sober. As a result of my recovery from active alcoholism, I discovered vipassana (insight) meditation, and began to practice it on a regular basis. Meditation has enabled me to befriend the body that I have been at odds with for most of my life, as well as to embrace the reality of my trans* experience with a level of compassion and acceptance that I never thought possible.</p>
<p>Today, I am connected with my own inner resources and more able to engage with my community than ever before. <strong>I am finally taking care of myself, and I have found the courage and fortitude to take some incredible steps on my journey to find refuge in my own skin.</strong></p>
<p>Three years ago, I legally changed my name to Jack W. Cooper. A little over one year ago, I started hormone replacement therapy, and now,<strong> I am finally ready to give myself this gift that I struggled long and hard to believe that I deserve.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Looking Forward</strong></p>
<p>It is with great pleasure that I ask for your help in achieving my goal of raising 6,000 dollars for the cost of the surgery, and 2,500 dollars to cover my living expenses during the 4 weeks I will be out of work while recuperating from the procedure. This adds up to a total of 8,500 dollars. <strong>Any amount raised beyond this goal will be paid forward to another transgender person who needs assistance with paying for a gender affirming surgery.</strong></p>
<p>Thank you so much for any financial help you are able to give, and for spreading the word to others who may be in a position to donate.</p>

<p>Disc golf is fantastic community sport, it's cheap, accessible and easy for anyone to learn and play. It is getting popular too... there are more than 5000 disc golf courses around the world.  </p></span><h3>Who are we?</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>We're a group of people who met through our love of playing frisbee with our Manchester-based Ultimate Frisbee club ""DUFFA"".</p>
<p>We were asked by Trafford Council and the Friends of Longford Park group to help set up a disc golf course on the site of a disused pitch and putt golf course in Longford Park in Manchester.</p>
</div> <p>We have a core working group of 10 people and a small army of volunteers who have helped us install our first three permanent baskets and run open days to showcase the sport. So far, about 400 people have tried it out!</p>
<p>Our team from DUFFA has a successful track record of running an annual not-for-profit community event with a £10,000+ turnover. We're very excited about bringing this project to life and sparking a surge in the take up of disc golf in the region. <br/></p>
<h3>The plan...</h3>
<p>We want to install nine permanent baskets, tees and signs, and buy more rental frisbee discs.  We will create a course that anyone can come and play, anytime, for free. We will use this course to build a strong community of players and friends, volunteering to run open days, and beginner sessions for schools and community groups.</p>
<p>If we exceed our funding goal we will be able to buy more permanent baskets, install more tees, plant more trees and work towards creating the first 18 hole course in the Northwest of England. The nearest proper 18 hole course is in Leamington Spa!</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>We need £4,000 to buy the material we need to install a 9-hole course. The installation will be done for free by our volunteers. </div>

<h3>Kristofer &amp; Mackenzies Dream</h3>
<p>Kristofer &amp; Mackenzie have been living in the Gold Coast hinterlands of Australia for arround five years. Once joining the same highschool they realised they had a lot in common. Not long after both Kristofer &amp; Mackenzie started Kung Fu (Tao Wu Shin) at a local monastery. This is what sparked both their interest in becoming fit, healthier human beings. Skip forward another year and they have decided they want to open a gym together.</p>
<p>People whom are willing to invest will help their dream greatly. Mackenzie already has the qualifications to be a personal trainer and this will help them tremendously on their journey. </p>
<p>It doesn't matter if you donate one dollar or a thousand dollars, every single cent will help us purchase gym equipment and potentially rent / buy a vacant property for training people.</p>
<p>To help persuade people into donating we have decided to set ourselves a challenge. For every single <strong>dollar</strong> we raise we will complete one full heave, film it and upload it to YouTube for your enjoyment. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here is the rough outline and plan to what we intend to acheive:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will be investing $4,500 of our own money towards gym equipment and locations.</li>
<li>We will be purchasing punching bags, kick pads, gloves, safety mats, weights and shinguards for our clients to use.</li>
<li>Each client will be charged a yearly fee of $120. That's simply $10 a month.</li>
</ul>
<p>As breifly mentioned before Kristofer &amp; Mackenzie will do one full heave for every single dollar donated. To make it clear how difficult heaves are: to get into the Marines you need to complete six full heaves. That means if we only get six dollars from this campaign we have the heave power of a Marine applicant.</p>
<p>All heaves will be recorded and posted on YouTube for all of you to watch and most probably enjoy.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Health and Fitness is a major component of our lives and by donating a few dollars you are helping us reach our dreams. That's right; you as an individual can help and inspire people like us to acheive their goals in life.</p>
<p>Not only will you be helping Mackenzie and I you will be helping the local community get fit and also reach their goals. <strong>Imagine this as a spiral of good.. all started by a few dollars from you. </strong>You donate money to us, we get a cheap and sustainable fitness program running and the community benefits. It's a win / win situation for everyone.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>We really hope you will be able to reach into your pockets and just donate a few dollars. Anything helps.. honestly.</h3>

The Transporter3D is a device that supports the Oculus Rift by converting remotely transmitted video into a virtual reality experience called ""telepresence"". 
We have been designing and manufacturing telepresence equipment embraced by the FPV (first person video) community for over 6 years.  Starting with the 3D-Cam FPV in 2006, we pioneered the transmission of 3D video for RC aircraft pilots who fly from the ground wearing video glasses.
Over the years we pushed the telepresence technology further with force feedback joysticks (ForceFly) and aerial combat simulation systems (DogFighter).  When the Oculus Rift was born it was the obvious direction for FPV telepresence.  The Rift technology presented some challenges to adapt to conventional FPV equipment.  We set to work solving the problems, never compromising on our initially stated goals (see original project goals below) or on the quality that EMR Laboratories is known for.  Once we solved the big challenges we took to flight, ringing out the technology (think multi-rotor speeder bikes), studying the experience and revising the requirements.  We diverged from our normal development route and decided to crowd source the final design – asking the community what features would make them love the Transporter3D as much as we do.  Your input helped us get there and we listened to your suggestions.
The T3D is a crowd sourced design.  We want every one of the contributors to have the chance to experience the indescribable feeling of Oculus FPV.  By backing the project you get exclusive access to the T3D technology, you’re getting in at the ground level.  Backers will always be original backers and will be recognized for exclusive offers as they develop.




Original Project Goals
From the start our objective was to create an Oculus Rift interface designed for standard FPV/telepresence equipment.  The hardware solution had to meet these four key goals:
No perceptible latency: FPV users want the lag free experience they’ve come to expect from their analog systems.  Lag in multi-rotor speeder bikes turns a Jedi into a Storm Trooper.
Video formatting: To adapt to the Rift, the video needs to be completely adjustable.  Users need to be able to adjust the video screen size and position to exactly what they want.  Zooming and alignment modes are critical to using the Rift.  The T3D also needs to process the video without violating the latency rule.
Video stability: The hardware needs to cope with noisy video.  Analog FPV video is noisy at times.  The hardware needs to pass video regardless of how noisy it is and handle it gracefully (ie no blue screens)



Stereo Video:  The T3D needs to support stereoscopic 3D video to accommodate the capabilities of the Rift.
Once we met these goals we asked you what else you wanted to see in the final product.  You told us you wanted:
Support for different video modes:  Support for a 2D mode for the single camera, super wide field-of-view experience.  Other users asked for 3D support using two separate video inputs from separate video cameras.
Battery powered:  In-the-field operation is easier if the device can be powered by LiPo batteries.  Support for a wide range of input voltages with a connector that’s ideal for batteries.
Power the Rift: The T3D should also be capable of powering the Rift so that the system can be a complete video glasses solution for FPV.
Support for Cinemizers:  Make the T3D output also compatible with the Cinemizer glasses for users who already own these exceptional quality glasses and want the 3D FPV support.
Head Tracking:  The T3D should support the use of the Rift’s 1000Hz zero-drift head tracker to output head-tracking signals for controlling the camera pan, tilt and roll.





So we did it, the T3D is alive!
With the final goals on the drawing board we set out to make the hardware.  We designed it to support all the features you requested and moved the design from 3rd party development board to our own custom hardware.  The complex hardware design was a first-time-right success!

T3D TechnologyThe T3D leverages an Altera Cyclone III FPGA (EP3C80F484C7N) for all its video processing.  The FPGA is programmable like a micro-processor except it’s actually the internal hardware that is being programmed.  This gives incredible speed, flexibility and power to achieve the T3D goals.  We’ve designed the T3D so that its internal hardware can be completely reconfigured simply by plugging in an identity module.  This future proofs the design and allows users to change the device functionality to suit their application.The T3D can run on voltages from 6V-18V and total power consumption including the Rift is 6W.  For instance, with a 12V supply the T3D draws 0.5A.  Using a standard 3 cell, 2200mAh LiPo battery the T3D and Rift combo will last 4 hours.

3D-Cam T3D Edition

Some users expressed interest in a case for the T3D.  We designed the T3D to fit into a custom machined case called the Transporter3D ‘Shuttle Craft’.  The case is sturdy protection for your T3D in the field.

I am
Keith Davies, president of Lifestyle Ministries International in Canada.
Born in
Durban South Africa, living in Canada and planting Moringa trees - called
""The Tree of Life"",  the world's most nutritious botanical!



In our Smart Plan, you will be starting Moringa tree nurseries in Haiti to reforest the country and improve the health of 9 million people. These fast growing trees grow one foot per month; in six months you have a mature six foot tree!
 In our Smart Plan, we will grow 100,000 seedlings in a 12 month period!
and........
taste a delicious Moringa smoothie, eat a delicious blueberry Moringa muffin, smell the aroma of Strawberry or Pomegranate Moringa tea, use our Moringa calculator and take a journey with us in our photo book.These are some of our great perks!
Make your contribution. Together we can do this!
Moringa tree leaves are an incredible natural source of bio-available vitamins, beta-carotene, minerals, and amino acids essential to good health and vital to building the immune systems of the Haitian people.
Sample the health benefits in the perks!
Our Smart Plan is in partnership with Dr Franco who runs the Generations of Hope Orphanage and the Ministry of Humanities and Poverty in Haiti.
                         Dr Franco with a seedling in Haiti



The Smart Plan

Our SMART PLAN helps orphanages and other institutions to grow the 100,000 seedlings in Haiti. It is very simple.
  
   Plant 2000 seeds in 10 designated locations each month over a five month optimum growing period. Doing this each month we will have produced 100,000 seedlings!

   Buy back the seedlings from the designated growers with funds from large organizations who have already committed to raising funds for the Plan.
 
  Teach potential recipients the Moringa Training Course which will help them grow and nurture the plants, dry the Moringa leaves, use them in recipes and sell them in the market place.
The duration of this program in one year.
Growing these 100,000 trees in the SMART PLAN is done by the Haitian people assisted by a trained team of dedicated experienced young people and adults coming mainly from Canada and the US.


       This is a realistic, achievable goal!

  Plus... Money earned through growing trees in our ""Buy Back Plan"" will be used by orphanages towards their self-sustainable goals. An orphanage can earn $2000 per month growing 1000 trees!We are not millionaires, but we can be part of planting seedlings in our 100,000 trees Smart Plan. ...... Plus you can sample Moringa Muffins, Moringa Smoothies and the aroma of our Moringa Tea in our Perks! ........ Plus, while you enjoy, you can read of our progress in the newsletter updates in our blog.

What will we do with the Moringa trees?
These trees will be planted throughout the land – some in the backyards of homes as a multivitamin medicine chest at their back door, others cultivated on farmland as a self-sustainable crop and others on hills and valleys to reforest the country. Products will be made and sold; the hills of Haiti will become alive with the sound of Moringa!
We are Ready!  

With seed.

With pilot projects

With people

With tools

 

 We already have collected thousands of local seed using children across the country who earn pocket money collecting seed.
We have run a pilot program with better than expected results.
The Haitian Diaspora Association has already committed to raising money for the buyback program of Moringa trees.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>My little sister lives in a cage of OCD and PTSD and could fall back/regress severely if her therapy isn't kept up. The NHS would put her on an extremely long waiting list and would not give her a child specialist and the private child specialist we found after her current psychiatrist has just retired is extremely expensive. Our medical insurance no longer covers mental health as it has been four years.<br/><br/><a href=""http://youtu.be/gGndhpZCqYY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://youtu.be/gGndhpZCqYY</a><br/><br/>My sister isn't comfortable with her face being shown on video and my family don't know I'm doing this but I can share this clip of one thing she enjoyed doing today:<br/><br/><a href=""http://youtu.be/r2PrTYNC_sQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://youtu.be/r2PrTYNC_sQ</a><br/><br/>She has to always wear a coat or sweater because she is so embarassed by her extensive self-harm scarring on her arms. Today her OCD is also telling her that she has to go on tip-toes when she moves. She loves our dog Moose more than anything but has never been able to come out and walk him with us.<br/><br/>She gets some relief by drawing when her OCD lets her, that is what the campaign photo is.<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>Anything can make life more manageable for my parents and for my sister who is aware of the stress the cost of her therapy puts on the family. Not because anyone says it to her, but to put it simply she's an extremely bright girl and so understands what's going on around her.<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You'll be helping my sister on her path to being free and helping my parents survive more comfortably and with less of a ""scrape"" after this surprise increase in expense, I won't let them not take anything you give.<br/></p>

I love the game and everything it entails and am constantly striving to improve my game and my enjoyment of the game. When a golfer sets up for his/her next shot, the most important factor that must be considered when selecting the appropriate golf club is the wind. Right now, the common practice to determine wind direction is to bend down, pick up a few blades of grass and throw them up in the air. Since I am over 50, bending down repeatedly isn't the most comfortable way to do it, nor is throwing grass in the air the most accurate. Often, a golfer will pick up too few blades or too many, so the process has to be repeated. An early morning or post rain round of golf will have you picking up wet grass and constantly wiping your hands on your pants.</p><p>Last summer, I was on the golf course on a par five hole and found myself within 215 yards from the green after my drive. With a good whack, that is a distance that is attainable for me but I needed to know what the wind was doing because of the water hazard in front of the green. If the wind was in my face, I wouldn't attempt it. I could feel the wind swirling around me but was unsure of which direction it was coming from. I looked at the flag on the green but it was hanging still because the green was completely shielded from the wind by the trees all around it. What did I do? I didn't go for it of course, and laid up to a safer distance. </p><p>It was at that point that I told myself that there had to be a better way of finding out which way the wind is blowing, and how hard. Since then, I have been diligently working on a new product (It's a BREEZE!) that will revolutionize the golf industry. Not only will my product tell you exactly which way the wind is blowing, but it will also indicate whether the player should use one or two extra or one or two less club numbers to be able to hit the perfect shot.</p><p>Unfortunately, this has been / is a significantly expensive process and I have spent a lot of money so far. Patent lawyers, designers, engineers, materials, production molds etc. have put me in the position to solicit the help of others to be able to realize this dream.

<h3>The Medical Activity App Angel Story</h3>
<p>Earlier this year I was admitted to hospital for surgery.  After surgery I experienced the difficulty many people face of trying to keep track of many different pills and different health related activities that I needed to do. It was too easy to miss medications prescribed by my doctor.  Always trying to find solutions to problems, I went searching and was unable to find a solution to help me easily track medications and other health events, so I came up with a solution to address this and hence the Medical Activity App project was born.  Not content with implementing a solution for myself I wanted to make this available to everyone and to cater for a wide range of needs.  Additionally I wanted to make it freely available and not be hindered with in-app advertising, I believe everyone should have access to good healthcare tools no matter what their circumstances.</p>
<p>Being an IT practitioner for over 20 years, I decided to take advantage of technology to solve this problem by making a Medical Activity App mobile application which can store health and medical related data and events for yourself and for others you care for.  I wanted to ensure that it is a free app and accessible to all, it is easy to use and designed to run on smartphones.</p>
<br/>
<p>Initially self funding the project to get it started, I am seeking assistance through this crowdfunding campaign to enable me to finish the Medical Activity App and make it available to everyone.</p>

The Medical Activity App solves a problem, easily keeping track of medical and health related events for ourselves, and the people we care about.  There are so many things we have to remember to do each day that it is hard to keep track of everything.

Millions of people around the world suffer from short and long term illness, with some dependant on daily medications to prolong life and to reduce suffering.   It is quite challenging to keep track of all the medical activities.  The Medical Activity App takes care of record keeping, letting you and your doctor focus on treatment and getting well.

<p>Who is Kara Lynn? Well, that's me! I am a 21 year old (turning 22 the day this campaign ends), transgender woman from Connecticut. I am currently a senior at a private university in Rhode Island, studying Fashion Merchandising &amp; Retail Marketing. I began my transition from male to female when I was 16. I have lived full-time, as a woman, for over 3 years and have been on hormones for over 2 years.

<p><b>78% of men age 15 - 34 do some sort of grooming below the neck.</b>  It’s now standard among young athletes - cross fitters, bodybuilders, MMA fighters, triathletes, runners &amp; swimmers - and virtually everyone who just wants to look their best and show off their muscle tone or tattoos. Regardless of this trend, the market has remained void of a masculine solution that really works.</p>
<p>Shaving? Tons of work and only lasts a day or two. Waxing? Expensive, painful and embarrassing. Hair removal creams? They're rebranded women’s lines stripped of all the important ingredients that care for the skin. This leaves us dry and prone to irritation. We work hard and play hard, but we like our skin soft. So why none of the good stuff for us?</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1016389/files/20141114225305-NoOtherMethods.jpg?1416034385"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>As a lifelong athlete myself I’ve dealt with all kinds of hair removal issues and I became determined to solve this problem. I shaved - like most - and I was constantly stubbly, maintaining every second day. Insane, right?  I was too embarrassed to set up a waxing appointment, so I tried waxing kits and removal creams. They all had limitations. Stinky, painful, messy, limitations. And my wife? She loves me, but not so much getting rid of my back hair. I always thought it brought us closer together…Didn’t it?</p>
<p>I'd finally had enough, and I wasn't alone. <br/></p>
<p></p>

<p><b>Why is your hair removal lotion better than the leading Men’s Cream?</b></p>
<p>Current leading men’s removal creams are single action, meaning they only remove hair.  They're stripped of all the beneficial skin care ingredients and their formulations are engineered for women’s skin.

Our second step refines, hydrates and soothes the skin while also reducing both TEWL (Trans epidermal water loss) and new regrowth.

</div></div>","IT'S A GAME CHANGER
78% of men age 15 - 34 do some sort of grooming below the neck.  It’s now standard among young athletes - cross fitters, bodybuilders, MMA fighters, triathletes, runners & swimmers - and virtually everyone who just wants to look their best and show off their muscle tone or tattoos. Regardless of this trend, the market has remained void of a masculine solution that really works.
Shaving? Tons of work and only lasts a day or two. Waxing? Expensive, painful and embarrassing. Hair removal creams? They're rebranded women’s lines stripped of all the important ingredients that care for the skin. This leaves us dry and prone to irritation. We work hard and play hard, but we like our skin soft. So why none of the good stuff for us?


As a lifelong athlete myself I’ve dealt with all kinds of hair removal issues and I became determined to solve this problem. I shaved - like most - and I was constantly stubbly, maintaining every second day. Insane, right?  I was too embarrassed to set up a waxing appointment, so I tried waxing kits and removal creams. They all had limitations. Stinky, painful, messy, limitations. And my wife? She loves me, but not so much getting rid of my back hair. I always thought it brought us closer together…Didn’t it?
I'd finally had enough, and I wasn't alone. 

This is why I teamed up with Andrew (the product guru in our video) to create SmoothTech|Pro. The first ever men's hair removal system specifically formulated to remove unwanted body hair and keep it from growing back. 


THE SMOOTHTECH|PRO SYSTEM
Our triple action, full body hair removal system not only 
removes unwanted hair, it restores moisture and reduces new regrowth 
leaving the skin smoother longer. It's easy, effective, pain free and long lasting. That means super 
smooth results (no more sandpaper ladies) and less maintenance. And for 
the back? We developed WINGMAN. Our applicator that enables men to remove back hair unassisted. It’s a game changer.
HERE'S HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS
STEP 1: ELIMINATE | Shower Off Hair Removal LotionRemoves body hair quickly, easily and painlessly. All natural ingredients, paraben, fragrance, petrolatum, sulfate & cruelty free.'Eliminate' Key Benefits:   •   Removes unwanted hair & impurities   •   Restores moisture   •   Fights free radicals   •   Exfoliates   •   Fights hard water damage

<h3>The Hope For Stability: Conquering Bipolar II<br/>
</h3> <p>Bipolar disorder is an debilitating mental illness with an appalling lack of resources for those suffering through a ""manic/depressive episode"". Maintaining a state of stability is a lifelong battle I fully accept.  For more than a year I have been in a ""mixed cycle"" of relentless mania overlapping with devastating depression. To put things in perspective: a manic/depressive episode typically lasts 1-3 months until medication induces mental stability. I have been consumed with all the classic symptoms for 18 months.  Every day continues to be an unknown gamble of mental states. <br/></p>
<p>My name is Jessica, I am freshly 25 years old and desperate for a chance to regain my life, my identity, my soul. Cursed with type II bipolar disorder it is a constant battle for stability.  With the traumatic symptoms come a forced inner strength molded by a fight-or-flight perspective. In spite of this disorder, I have an unyielding passion for life. I followed my childhood dream and graduated from the Culinary Institute Of America (Greystone, Napa Valley) with an associates degree in baking &amp; pastry. I have since dedicated myself to working in Michelin Star restaurants and studying under world champion chefs evolving, learning, and growing. I am obsessive about my passions for pastry, art, and introspective growth. The sublime opportunities and experiences I cherish have made the fall to rock-bottom infinitely more devastating.</p>

</div></div>","The Hope For Stability: Conquering Bipolar II
 Bipolar disorder is an debilitating mental illness with an appalling lack of resources for those suffering through a ""manic/depressive episode"". Maintaining a state of stability is a lifelong battle I fully accept.  For more than a year I have been in a ""mixed cycle"" of relentless mania overlapping with devastating depression. To put things in perspective: a manic/depressive episode typically lasts 1-3 months until medication induces mental stability. I have been consumed with all the classic symptoms for 18 months.  Every day continues to be an unknown gamble of mental states. 
My name is Jessica, I am freshly 25 years old and desperate for a chance to regain my life, my identity, my soul. Cursed with type II bipolar disorder it is a constant battle for stability.  With the traumatic symptoms come a forced inner strength molded by a fight-or-flight perspective. In spite of this disorder, I have an unyielding passion for life. I followed my childhood dream and graduated from the Culinary Institute Of America (Greystone, Napa Valley) with an associates degree in baking & pastry. I have since dedicated myself to working in Michelin Star restaurants and studying under world champion chefs evolving, learning, and growing. I am obsessive about my passions for pastry, art, and introspective growth. The sublime opportunities and experiences I cherish have made the fall to rock-bottom infinitely more devastating.
During culinary school, I experienced my first ""hypo-manic/depressive state."" An acute version of a full-blown ""episode"" I was ripped from reality without warning.

celebrating their bodies, not bashing them; of choosing health at every size,
not diets and unreal body ideals. 
We dream of people relating to their bodies
as their instrument to be of purpose and service in the world, not an object to
be criticized, scrutinized, and sexualized.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p> Hi my name is Kristy Lockhart and my best friend was diagnosed with Lyme Disease in 2012 after being misdiagnosed for many years. It took her years and at least 100 doctors/hospital/specialist appointments and visits to finally receive a proper diagnosis. </p><p></p><p>In March 2014 Heather was 50% better in beating lyme, this has to do with her amazing lyme doctor &amp; her extraordinary chiropractor and naturopath team &amp; her own strength.  Heather was on same antibiotics for 18 months, she got bit by ‘something’ weeks ago, ever since then she went from being 50% better to only 10% better with 80% of her previous lyme symptoms returning.  She was bit by an unknown bug in late march which caused her ankle to turn red and swell double it’s size, insane itch, she wasn’t able to walk and I took her to the hospital emergency 3 times in one week to get no help, no referrals, nothing. For the last 6 months there was so much improvement, so much hope and light, and now, to be perfectly honesty, we are scared. Physically and neurologically it is as if Heather’s state is as it was before we even started lyme treatment back in September 2012.  I have to help her wash her hair, I have to prepare all of her meals, do her laundry and dishes as her joints are swollen, painful and inflamed and she can’t do the things she normally did for the last 6 months as this new ‘infection’ is making all symptoms return that were seemingly gone.  We have made an emergency appointment to go back to her lyme doctor only a month after seeing her, as everything we were doing (medication/supplement/etc wise) is no longer working.  So far, in 2014 Heather has gotten shingles 3 times &amp; is currently trying to recover from them again. Her immune system is compromised and this is the cause of them recurring.</p><p>Thank you to heather’s loving online family, on redbubble and face book, to her friends and even strangers that have donated in the past, shared this link, and supported her with love, kindness and patience and unconditional love during her journey. I couldn’t have helped heather go this far without all of you beautiful souls, and I don’t know what we would do without you. It’s a scary time, Heather likes to put on a brave face, but I myself am not only her best friend, but caregiver and have been watching her rapidly decline over the last few weeks. I need your help now more than ever.</p><p>If you know you were bitten by a tick and seek immediate treatment in Canada you go on antibiotics for a few weeks and you’re cured. If you didn’t know you were bit by a tick the tick not only infects you with a devastating bacteria, but it lays its eggs in your body which hatch in 18 days. Heather went almost 4 years in extreme physical pain, I watched her mind and body deteriorate in the most devastating way. Going to every medical appointment, ambulance ride, neurosurgeon, MRI, family dr visit and never getting an answer, having it all blamed on her ‘anxiety’ I decided to take matters into my own hands and researched full time, it was months of extensive research that all signs and symptoms pointed to lyme disease.  In Canada treatment beyond a month is NOT available. Chronic lyme is not treated in Canada, and the few doctors who have done so, have lost their license.  This is why we have to travel to the USA every 3 months for treatment and expensive antibiotics which are not covered.</p><p>The majority of people with Lyme disease are misdiagnosed for years and by the time it is discovered it is almost too late</p><p> </p><p>In 2009 Heather had a gym membership, walked 5 miles a day, hiked, spent time in nature, and constantly doing photo shoots. Now, she can't walk more than 20 minutes, becomes so fatigued far too quickly, has difficulty breathing, chest pains, migraines, her joints swell up so bad she can't write or type, difficulty folding laundry, doing dishes and playing with her cat. Something in her body is malfunctioning as her entire body is covered in edema.</p><p>This woman means everything to me. I can't put into words how I love her. She is an amazing artist/photographer (<a href=""http://www.locustgirl.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>www.locustgirl.com</u></a><a href=""http://www.redbubble.com/people/locustgirl"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>www.redbubble.com/people/locustgirl</u></a>) and a genuine pure soul and there's nothing I won't do for her. Meeting someone like this only happens once in a lifetime, and I fear her lifetime will be over soon if her medical treatment is unable to continue.</p><p>Donating to this campaign will ensure proper medical care and treatment and lodging while undergoing this care. It doesn't matter if it's $1 or $1000 every little bit helps. Even if you have no $ to donate, please will you post this on various social networking tools to spread the word?</p><p>Even while ill, both she and I helped out with other fundraisers (Rideau Valley Wildlife Sanctuary) by donating hundreds of dollars worth of her art to be sold to help treat injured wildlife. She went to college to learn how to take care of the disabled, now she is disabled.</p><p></p><p>On a happier note, Heather got to spend time with her favorite wild snowy owl this year, snowy momma goddess and this owl was/is the reason why Heather continues to have hope/fight, as 3.5 yrs ago she had lyme and no one would help/diagnose her, and meeting this owl, watching this owl survive and brave the cold ALONE is what motivated Heather to change her life for the better, mentally and emotionally.</p><p>-if you look under the tab ‘gallery’ you will see photographs of this beautiful owl and many other wildlife photos that we are offering as a perk, our gift to you for donating.</p><p>Please check out her wildlife photography as they will make you fall even deeper in love with wildlife.  Heather (when she is able to go out) has this deep soulful connection with animals and it clearly shows in her photography.</p><p></p><p>She left home at 15 and she has no blood relatives who can help her, and she hasn't worked for years due to being so ill.

It took her years and at least 100 doctors/hospital/specialist appointments and visits to finally receive a proper diagnosis. In March 2014 Heather was 50% better in beating lyme, this has to do with her amazing lyme doctor & her extraordinary chiropractor and naturopath team & her own strength.  Heather was on same antibiotics for 18 months, she got bit by ‘something’ weeks ago, ever since then she went from being 50% better to only 10% better with 80% of her previous lyme symptoms returning.  She was bit by an unknown bug in late march which caused her ankle to turn red and swell double it’s size, insane itch, she wasn’t able to walk and I took her to the hospital emergency 3 times in one week to get no help, no referrals, nothing. For the last 6 months there was so much improvement, so much hope and light, and now, to be perfectly honesty, we are scared. Physically and neurologically it is as if Heather’s state is as it was before we even started lyme treatment back in September 2012.  I have to help her wash her hair, I have to prepare all of her meals, do her laundry and dishes as her joints are swollen, painful and inflamed and she can’t do the things she normally did for the last 6 months as this new ‘infection’ is making all symptoms return that were seemingly gone.  We have made an emergency appointment to go back to her lyme doctor only a month after seeing her, as everything we were doing (medication/supplement/etc wise) is no longer working.  So far, in 2014 Heather has gotten shingles 3 times & is currently trying to recover from them again. Her immune system is compromised and this is the cause of them recurring.Thank you to heather’s loving online family, on redbubble and face book, to her friends and even strangers that have donated in the past, shared this link, and supported her with love, kindness and patience and unconditional love during her journey. I couldn’t have helped heather go this far without all of you beautiful souls, and I don’t know what we would do without you. It’s a scary time, Heather likes to put on a brave face, but I myself am not only her best friend, but caregiver and have been watching her rapidly decline over the last few weeks. I need your help now more than ever.If you know you were bitten by a tick and seek immediate treatment in Canada you go on antibiotics for a few weeks and you’re cured. If you didn’t know you were bit by a tick the tick not only infects you with a devastating bacteria, but it lays its eggs in your body which hatch in 18 days. Heather went almost 4 years in extreme physical pain, I watched her mind and body deteriorate in the most devastating way. Going to every medical appointment, ambulance ride, neurosurgeon, MRI, family dr visit and never getting an answer, having it all blamed on her ‘anxiety’ I decided to take matters into my own hands and researched full time, it was months of extensive research that all signs and symptoms pointed to lyme disease.  In Canada treatment beyond a month is NOT available. Chronic lyme is not treated in Canada, and the few doctors who have done so, have lost their license.  This is why we have to travel to the USA every 3 months for treatment and expensive antibiotics which are not covered.The majority of people with Lyme disease are misdiagnosed for years and by the time it is discovered it is almost too late In 2009 Heather had a gym membership, walked 5 miles a day, hiked, spent time in nature, and constantly doing photo shoots. Now, she can't walk more than 20 minutes, becomes so fatigued far too quickly, has difficulty breathing, chest pains, migraines, her joints swell up so bad she can't write or type, difficulty folding laundry, doing dishes and playing with her cat. Something in her body is malfunctioning as her entire body is covered in edema.This woman means everything to me. I can't put into words how I love her. She is an amazing artist/photographer (www.locustgirl.comwww.redbubble.com/people/locustgirl) and a genuine pure soul and there's nothing I won't do for her. Meeting someone like this only happens once in a lifetime, and I fear her lifetime will be over soon if her medical treatment is unable to continue.Donating to this campaign will ensure proper medical care and treatment and lodging while undergoing this care. It doesn't matter if it's $1 or $1000 every little bit helps. Even if you have no $ to donate, please will you post this on various social networking tools to spread the word?Even while ill, both she and I helped out with other fundraisers (Rideau Valley Wildlife Sanctuary) by donating hundreds of dollars worth of her art to be sold to help treat injured wildlife. She went to college to learn how to take care of the disabled, now she is disabled.On a happier note, Heather got to spend time with her favorite wild snowy owl this year, snowy momma goddess and this owl was/is the reason why Heather continues to have hope/fight, as 3.5 yrs ago she had lyme and no one would help/diagnose her, and meeting this owl, watching this owl survive and brave the cold ALONE is what motivated Heather to change her life for the better, mentally and emotionally.-if you look under the tab ‘gallery’ you will see photographs of this beautiful owl and many other wildlife photos that we are offering as a perk, our gift to you for donating.Please check out her wildlife photography as they will make you fall even deeper in love with wildlife.  Heather (when she is able to go out) has this deep soulful connection with animals and it clearly shows in her photography.She left home at 15 and she has no blood relatives who can help her, and she hasn't worked for years due to being so ill. I am a single woman and the ONLY person who has been helping her for years, please can you help me help her? Any questions or for a list of the prints you would like, please email me here lockhart_ottawa@hotmail.comI promise you if you were to meet Heather you would love her almost as much as I do. I have never met another soul with such an enormous loving heart as hers.

<p><br/></p><p>Being healthy is a state of
physical, mental and emotional well-being and the most important condition for
a long and happy life. In our fast moving world with all its demands of being
stress-resistant, flexible and having quick reactions to changes, health
awareness becomes more and more important for everyone. Before we are thinking
of how we should be, how our lives should be, how the world should be, these
days we are thinking of HOW WE ARE. </p>
<p><b>We are
supporting that! HEALTH IS LIFESTYLE, PREVENTION IS IN.<br/></b></p>
<p>With VIDAMETER we want to emphasize
the well-being of each individual and show it in every moment. VIDAMETER is designed to shape the relationship of health, vitality and security with a lasting effect.
This smartband
is the first of its kind that combines ALL features of conventional fitness
trackers, healthcare products and other wearable devices. <br/></p><p></p><p>Many of the products already
available on the market only allow the user the detection of isolated vitality
and fitness signs, so that only limited analyses are possible. VIDAMETER captures
all vital signs such as pulse, blood flow rate, blood oxygen saturation, levels
of activity, calories, steps and skin temperature, prepares all data
transparently and gives actively recommendations and directions about the vital
state.</p><p></p>
<p>Additionally, it provides all-round
protection for the precious life of each individual trough the integration of
fully automatic emergency alerting. VIDAMETER detects danger in emergency
situations and automatically calls for help. It provides location data and information
about the physical condition of the person in need, so that emergency workers
lose little time and can take the necessary action immediately.</p>
<p>All these advantages integrated,
VIDAMETER forms a truly unique product that delivers incomparable insights into
the human body and thus helps to optimize the health and well-being and can
also save lives.</p>
<p>On top of that, VIDAMETER is
equipped with NFC-technology, which simplify everyone’s daily life even more by
enabling cashless shopping, barcode scanning or a keyless entry system. That
and boundless other possibilities of VIDAMETER bring people exactly back there
– to enjoy their life and the things they love.</p>
<p>Our aim is for you to achieve a
better understanding of your skills, abilities and health while
enjoying your life and the things you love. With your support in this campaign,
VIDAMETER could become a truly outstanding addition to our lives.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/544260/files/20140430014145-_line.png?1398847305"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>

</p><p>VIDAMETER achieves the optimal
wearing comfort trough the memory-effect of the polymer wristband. Polymer is an
100 % recyclable material and is thus completely environmentally friendly.
Furthermore this material has the characteristic to learn shapes and so it fits
like a second skin to your wrist. So VIDAMETER feels natural and is completely
hypoallergenic. </p>
<p>It also has no clasp. VIDAMETER
works in sympathy with its wearer and automatically adapts itself to your
wrist. So it cannot fall off or be ripped of from your arm, not even in extreme
situations. </p>

</p><p>Impulse for the idea of VIDAMETER
was an accident in April 2013, where a young man had to wait for rescue for
more than 8 hours in vain and that only 300 meters away from his home. Nobody
heard his shouts, nobody noticed him and initially nobody missed him. </p>
<p>Since this incident, we were
profoundly convinced, that in this day and age, it could not be that one has to
wait for such a long time to get first aid. We wanted to change that! </p>
<p>Subsequently our team has been spending a lot of time, work, money and care
on the development of VIDAMETER and engaging in all processes such as product
design, engineering, software programming, production planning or logistics.</p>
<p>We have gathered thousands of
personal consumer insights and stories of fate. We have talked to a handful of
experts who are specialised in sensor technology and programming, software
development and medicine and nursing and to members of diverse professional
groups like emergency medical or fire services. And we tried to find ideal development partners
for the future realization of VIDAMETER. </p><p>
</p><p>Based on all these activities
we defined VIDAMETER’s customer value, we made a feasibility study, set the
sensor technology and the design and build a first electronic prototype. Now we
are at the ready and with your support it is possible that VIDAMETER becomes
reality!</p>

</p><p>As you may know, a project is a targeted, one-time undertaking, which consists of a set of coordinated and controlled activities with
start and finish dates. Most commonly, a project
is performed by taking
into account risks in terms of
time, resources (eg money or
costs or production) and quality to achieve the defined goal. </p>
<p>The same is true to the VIDAMETER project. We have the
aim to launch a product in late 2015, which measures the well-being of everyone
and so improve, lengthen and save countless lives. Although we have drawn up a
consistent and conclusive project plan, we also face risks and challenges, which
we try to minimize with different actions taken by us and your support:</p>
<p><b>CHALLENGE NO 1
<b>–</b> Production</b></p>
<p>Due to the
newness and the small seize of the components in VIDAMETER we are initially depending
on a handful of producers who are specialised in sensor technology. At present
it is still too cost-intensive to produce the required sensors by our own. </p>
<p><b>How do we meet this challenge?</b> To avoid potential bottlenecks we purchase
the components in quantity less expensive. Furthermore we try to be in close
dialogue with the critical producers and build up a long-standing business
relation with them to ensure the constant supply. As start-up we can provide
them the necessary flexibility and possibility to test their innovations in
real and get quick and accurate results. In the long term, however, we would
like to produce the required components on our own in Austria and thus generate
new jobs, contribute to the net product of Austria and stimulate the regional
economy. </p>
<p><b>Your support </b>will help us to make all this possible more
powerful and quicker. On the back of your help we are able to negotiate better
terms for the resources and we are able to start the production in Austria
earlier. </p>
<p><b>CHALLENGE NO 2 
– Data</b></p>
<p>Another challenge
is the data for the programming. We need precise and consistent data to
finetune the software programming, because software is only as good as the
data, it is processing. This is why live tests are very important to us to get
real data of different persons. </p>
<p><b>How do we meet this challenge?</b> All members of our team will wear a VIDAMETER
at every moment and keep records of their vital states. In addition we have
already attracted support from a professional stunt crew who will wear
VIDAMETER while doing stunts like accidents, spills and much more and a
professional porno production team who will wear VIDAMETER during their
shootings. In this way we can analyse data from different and uncommon
situations. </p>
<p><b>With your support</b> we still get more of the required data out
of daily life! You could be one of our 1000 BETA-Testers who are content to
wear VIDAMETER at every moment and measure their vital data. With your help and
your data we could get the most out of the VIDAMETER project.</p>
<p><b>CHALLENGE NO 3 –
Data security</b></p>
<p>Data security
is a very important issue for us! In
times of Heartbleed, the NSA spying scandal, Whatsapp or Facebook we are
mindful of data security by all means. We want that
your data stays private and is protected in the best possible way. </p>
<p><b>How do we meet this challenge? </b>Prior to our launch of VIDAEMTER we are
organizing a hacker-contest with the world’s best hackers to ensure the best
possible data privacy. If they succeed in hacking VIDAMETER, we would be able to
determine any security gaps in advance and close them fastest possible to have
one of the safest products in the world.</p>
<p><b>By supporting our campaign and pre-ordering
your VIDAMETER</b> you will be
part of our revolution, which counteracts the surveillance state, certain
social media platforms that are acting like a modern STASI and global
technology players who deceive you with their marketing campaigns and their
lifestyle products to soak you and to make money out of your data. </p>
<p><b>CHALLENGE NO 4 –
Time</b></p>
<p>Since summer 2013, our team has been spending a lot of
time, work, money and care on the development of VIDAMETER and engaging in all
processes such as feasibility studies, product design, production planning or
logistics.So far we have done 8 months of groundwork for
VIDAMETER. Now all we need is in place and we are on the verge of realizing our
vision! We are ready to pursue our tough and comprehensive plan by the end of
2015.</p>
<p><b>How do we meet this challenge?</b> We know that our project plan takes up a lot
of time (18 months). Please be sure, that our plan is well-wrought, all steps
are elaborated and each hour of work is worth it! We are convinced that quality
needs its time. That is why the delivery of VIDAMETER needs a little bit more
time than that of others products. But only thus we can promise that you will
get your VIDAMETER without delays and at the best quality. </p>
<p><b>You can help us </b>with your confidence, your patience and your
participation! We would be happy to get your support and your feedback to our
product and our ideas. Get in touch with us on <a href=""mailto:hello@vidamet.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><u>hello@vidamet.com</u></span></a>. </p>
<p>If you have any
further questions regarding the risks and challenges in the VIDAMETER project,
please to not hesitate to contact us. We would love to justify ourselves to
you!</p>

</p><p><b>How long do I have warranty on VIDAMETER?</b></p>
<p>The warranty for VIDAMETER is 2 years from date of shipment and include
updates and replacement, in the event that your VIDAMETER is defective. We will
also grant you the right of return VIDAMETER withing 30 days from delivery when
you are not statisfied with it. Without giving any reasons you will get your
money back .</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>Are the functions of VIDAMETER patented?</b></p>
<p>Single functions of VIDAMETER, such as the automatic emergency alarm
including transmission of vital data of the person in need, have already been patented.
Many more features are to be patented right now (patent application pending). We
can not continuously protect our product from imitators with these patents, but
so we can prevent that similar products are coming to the market that have been
made with less care and quality, and are not such a well-conceived product as VIDAMETER
.</p>
<p><br/><b>Can I do any activities with VIDAMETER?
Swimming, climbing, boxing, etc.?</b></p>
<p>Yes, VIDAMETER is designed that it accompanies you in every situation and
does not hinder or bother you. Whether in your daily routine activities such as
showering or cleaning the house, in your sport activities such as tennis,
swimming, or climbing, or in exceptional cases such as an accident, VIDAMETER
is there for you in every moment.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>How shock resistant and waterproof is VIDAMETER?</b></p>
<p>Fire, water, earth or air can not harm VIDAMETER. It is scratch-resistant
and shock-proof, water-resistant up to 300 meters and operates without problems
in a temperature range of -40 to +80 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p><br/><b>Can I use VIDAMETER together with my
smartphone?</b></p>
<p>Basically VIDAMETER is fully self-contained. We do not want to give you an
additional device, which you then can use only in connection with your
smartphone, your tablet or your PC. Of course, there are APPs for VIDAMETER
developed by us and partners, with which you can make settings and reports
directly on your smartphone.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>Why can I pre-order my VIDAMETER only by credit card?</b><br/></p><p>As you may know, Indiegogo offers two option for contributing to Crowdfunding projects. You can either pay by credit card or with PayPal. We only opted for the payment by credit card. We strictly deny PayPal due to reasons related to data protection, reports of problems with the outpayments in other projects and hidden additional costs for you and us, too. Of course, we want to make your transfer of funds as easy as possible. So if you have not a credit card or you do not have the possibility to pre-order your VIDAMETER by prepaid card, please write us an email to <a href=""mailto:hello@vidamet.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""mailto:hello@vidamet.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>hello@vidamet.com</u></a>. We will find a solution for this issue. As we have a flexible funding, we will keep what we raise anyway and do not get all or nothing.<br/></p>
<p><br/><b>What if I am not satisfied with VIDAMETER?</b></p>
<p>Then you simple write us a mail and explain us why you are not satisfied.
Either we can solve your dissatisfaction together or you send us your VIDAMETER
back and get your money in return.</p>
<p><br/><b>How is the comfort (right size, skin
compatibility, etc.) of VIDAMETER?</b></p>
<p>The optimal wearing comfort is made possible through the memory effect in the
polymerwristband. Polymer has the charateristic to remember states, therefore
VIDAMETER is like a second skin around your wrist. So it feels natural and is completely
hypoallergenic thanks to the 100 % recyclable material polymer. VIDAMETER does
not require a suitable lock. It automatically adaptts to your wrist , so it can
not fall off or be pulled off of your arm, even in extreme situations.</p>
<p><br/><b>Can I program VIDAMETER autonomosly?</b></p>
<p>You can easily make settings (time and date setting , weight, and age etc.
) for your VIDAMETER. This can be done directly on the screen for which you do
not need any programming skills to do so. But if you are comfortable with
programming, you can also develop your own app for VIDAMETER. More information
can be found under the Developer section.</p><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>How is my health status displayed?</b></p>
<p>Your health status will be shown directly on the display of VIDAMETER. Easy
understandable icons indicate you how you are and give you short information
about your vital state. In addition, colored LED lights on the edge of
VIDAMETER display your status, thus, you can see at a glance how you are doing.
Long-term evaluations of your health can be made on your smartphone, tablet or
PC.</p>
<p><br/><b>Do I have to enter my data (weight, age,
etc. ) into VIDAMETER by myself?</b></p>
<p>No, you do not have to enter these settings by yourself. We will be happy
to help you if you send us your basic data. However, we believe that you can
easily even successfully perform the settings by the simple and intuitive operation
of VIDAMETER. On our website <a href=""http://www.vidameter.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.vidameter.com</a> is a video tutorial available in
which you all will be explained in detail and easy to understand , in case you
need help.</p>
<p><br/><b>Can I provide my data for my doctor?</b></p>
<p>Your data belongs to you! You have them available in a safe, secure and
encrypted format. You can give your doctor the information he needs, only if
you want to. It is your choice and we assume no liability for it. You can
decide this with the simple click on your PC before you print the data or save them
on your USB stick.</p>
<p><br/><b>How much will VIDAMETER cost? </b></p>
<p>VIDAMETER will be available on the market at a retail price of € 349 EUR, £ 289
GBP or $ 479 USD in DECEMBER 2015. We deliver VIDAMETER with a description in analog and digital
form and the relevant software for Windows Phone, Windows Desktop, Android and
iOS. Unfortunately, the shipping costs have to paid by you. <br/></p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>Can I customize the design of VIDAMETER individually? </b></p>
<p>VIDAMETER is available in various colors. In addtion, we can muster any
kind of design on the smartband and so vote your VIDAMETER individually for
you. Either you send us your template or theme that you would liked to have,
and our design team designs your custom design, or you can take pot luck. The
additional charge for this service is € 69 EUR,  £ 59 GBP, $ 89 USD.</p>
<p> <br/><b>Is the</b><b> size of the smartband
adjustable? </b></p>
<p>VIDAMETER is available in 3 different lengths. This ensures that everyone will get its VIDAMETER in the appropriate size. It perfectly adjusts to
your wrist and hugs it smootly so that the sensors are located in the right place. This is why you will have
no problem that your VIDAMETER is too
tight or too loose. It feels
like a second skin.</p>
<p><br/><b>How can I make sure that all sensors of VIDAMETER work properly?</b></p>
<p>VIDAMETER makes a self-test every 24 hours. Provided that VIDAMETER detects
that a sensor is faulty in this test, you will receive a message on the display
.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>How does VIDAMETER work in an emergency?</b><br/><br/>VIDAMETER's nine sensors recognize an emergency from the change of your vital data. If you are unconscious or injured, VIDAMETER automatically sends an emergency call and informs up to 10 pre-defined persons or institutions via encrypted SMS, MMS or E-Mail (you have the possibility to predefine it). This message contains data of your location and your vital state. As soon as the recipient opens the message, the data appears on the mobile phone display as a snapshot. The received data will not be stored on the mobile phone of the recipient. Should your vital state change, a new message is sent. We are working with a partner with whom it is possible to send the data in any part of the world, even without a mobile reception.<br/></p>
<p><br/><b>Where will I get a VIDAMETER after the official market launch?</b></p>
<p>We will distribute VIDAMETER directly through our online store on <a href=""http://www.vidameter.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.vidameter.com</a> after the Indiegogo-Campaign. On the one hand this saves you money and on the other one we can offer you
the best support and the ideal consulting which are necessary. Because we best know
our product.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>How is the best possible data security guaranteed?</b></p>
<p>Unfortunately we cannot guarantee a data security of 100 %. But we will do
everything for it to give you the best possible security. We employ the best
programmers and annually organize a hacker-contest in which the best hackers in
the world will try to hack VIDAMETER. So we can identify potential data leaks
and close them immediately, even before you will get your VIDAMETER!</p>
<p><br/><b>Does VIDAMETER measure my vital signs
anytime, anywhere ?</b></p>
<p>Yes, the bracelet is measuring your vital signs discreetly and quietly at
every moment. Only this way is it possible to detect irregularities and
""hidden"" diseases in time and prevent it. The same applies in case of
accidents and other health ailments. The more often the vital signs are
measured and faster you know that your body is not doing well, the faster and
easier you can be helped.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>Why does VIDAMETER cost € 349 EUR, £ 289 GBP or $ 479 USD?</b></p>
<p>VIDAMETER is unique! It integrates useful and life-saving functions of the
safety , fitness and health sector into one product and replaces all currently
available Fitness and Activity-Trackers. In addition, it simplifies your life through
functions such as smart alarm, scanning or cashless shopping. VIDAMETER is
there in every moment to capture your well-being and save your life. We find
that makes the decisive added value!</p><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>How long is the useful life of VIDAMETER?</b></p>
<p>We estimate a useful life of 5 to 10 years as the average lifespan of the
sensors and components integrated in VIDAMETER is about as long . We can make long-term
tests as soon as VIDAMETER is available on the market in greater quantity.<br/></p>
<p><br/><b>Can I upgrade to the Developer Package?</b></p>
<p>Of course this is also possible! As long as developer packages are
available on Indiegogo , you can get your Developer Package from us. Working
together with developers is important for us and we do not want to create the
world around VIDAMETER all alone. We will provide Developer packages even after
the Indiegogo campaign. But then to slightly changed conditions.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Can I obtain VIDAMETER prescriped from my doctor or is
there any support from the health insurances?</b></p>
<p>At the present time we are not ready that VIDAMETER is integrated into the
national health systems. But we are working on it. With your support, we
already go one-step further.</p>
<p><br/><b>Can I transfer data such as information
about my blood type, allergies, etc. to my VIDAMETER?</b></p>
<p>Yes, you can also store personal information on your VIDAMETER. Here we
will help you. Because in order to provide data security, they should be
encrypted. It is important for us that your information is correct and can be quickly
accessed at the crucial moment.</p>
<p><br/><b>Can I measure my blood pressure with
VIDAMETER too?</b></p>
<p>Yes, this is possible. The blood pressure cannot only be measured by a sphygmomanometer.
This is also possible by ultrasonic. While the blood pressure monitor measures
only the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, the overall trend of the blood
pressure can be measured by ultrasonic. This is much more accurate and
meaningful.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>When will VIDAMETER be available?</b></p>
<p>According to our plan we will start to deliver VIDAMETER to our 1000
Beta-Testers in JULY 2015. In NOVEMBER 2015 all our supporters on Indiegogo
will get their preordered VIDAMETER. Finally, in DECEMBER 2015 VIDAMETER will
be available on the market. <br/></p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>How can I be sure that you stick to your production plan?</b></p>
<p>We looked at other successful funded past projects and understand your
resentment and doubts when products are shipped partially 3 years after the
scheduled date of delivery to the supporters. To ensure that our production
schedule is met, we have calculated very accurately, installed appropriate
slack times and tried to secure critical production steps as far as possible.
We produce by ourselves and already have fixed commitments for the sensors from
our partners, so nothing stand in the way to met the production plan. Should
everything run really perfectly and according to plan, we would even be ready
three months prior to the scheduled delivery date (November 2015) and you will
get your VIDAMETER earlier. We do not promise that, but strive to achieve this
goal.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><b>After the beta testing phase, will the VIDAMETER I have be the same as the released product?</b></p><p>All
 Beta-testers will get a fully operative VIDAMETER. It will have the 
same functionality like that of the Early Birds and the released 
product, because after the Beta-tests we will upgrade them with the 
latest software update (we upgrade all algorithms and fix all problems).
 The Beta-tests are the most important to adapt VIDAMETER to the needs of its potential wearers at best possible.
 They will help us to finetune VIDAMETER. It could be that the sensors 
in the Beta-VIDAMETER will have different versions compared to the 
released product, but this is in consequence of general further 
development. You will not notice any differences in context to the 
functionality. The warranty for all Beta-VIDAMETERs is limited to 1 year from date of shipment and include 
updates and replacement, in the event that your VIDAMETER is defective.

<p></p></div>","VIDAMETER is not just another smartband, emergency bracelet or fitness tracker. VIDAMETER IS MORE! It combines essential and life-saving features in one wristband and forms the ultimate device for health, fitness and life-saving!Take a look at this image and you will see what makes VIDAMETER so unique and incomparable to any other wearable device on the market. 
Being healthy is a state of
physical, mental and emotional well-being and the most important condition for
a long and happy life. In our fast moving world with all its demands of being
stress-resistant, flexible and having quick reactions to changes, health
awareness becomes more and more important for everyone. Before we are thinking
of how we should be, how our lives should be, how the world should be, these
days we are thinking of HOW WE ARE. 
We are
supporting that! HEALTH IS LIFESTYLE, PREVENTION IS IN.
With VIDAMETER we want to emphasize
the well-being of each individual and show it in every moment. VIDAMETER is designed to shape the relationship of health, vitality and security with a lasting effect.
This smartband
is the first of its kind that combines ALL features of conventional fitness
trackers, healthcare products and other wearable devices. Many of the products already
available on the market only allow the user the detection of isolated vitality
and fitness signs, so that only limited analyses are possible. VIDAMETER captures
all vital signs such as pulse, blood flow rate, blood oxygen saturation, levels
of activity, calories, steps and skin temperature, prepares all data
transparently and gives actively recommendations and directions about the vital
state.
Additionally, it provides all-round
protection for the precious life of each individual trough the integration of
fully automatic emergency alerting. VIDAMETER detects danger in emergency
situations and automatically calls for help. It provides location data and information
about the physical condition of the person in need, so that emergency workers
lose little time and can take the necessary action immediately.
All these advantages integrated,
VIDAMETER forms a truly unique product that delivers incomparable insights into
the human body and thus helps to optimize the health and well-being and can
also save lives.
On top of that, VIDAMETER is
equipped with NFC-technology, which simplify everyone’s daily life even more by
enabling cashless shopping, barcode scanning or a keyless entry system. That
and boundless other possibilities of VIDAMETER bring people exactly back there
– to enjoy their life and the things they love.
Our aim is for you to achieve a
better understanding of your skills, abilities and health while
enjoying your life and the things you love. With your support in this campaign,
VIDAMETER could become a truly outstanding addition to our lives.
VIDAMETER
is a friendly and discrete
assistant that completely
records and carefully monitors your well-being on your wrist. Whether newborn,
child, teen, adult or the older generation - VIDAMETER is really interested in
how you are and take care of your life at every moment. We have developed the
revolutionary smartband VIDAMETER as the world ́s first holistic product approach to
well-being. It offers multiple unique features: 


VIDAMETER achieves the optimal
wearing comfort trough the memory-effect of the polymer wristband. Polymer is an
100 % recyclable material and is thus completely environmentally friendly.
Furthermore this material has the characteristic to learn shapes and so it fits
like a second skin to your wrist. So VIDAMETER feels natural and is completely
hypoallergenic. 
It also has no clasp. VIDAMETER
works in sympathy with its wearer and automatically adapts itself to your
wrist. So it cannot fall off or be ripped of from your arm, not even in extreme
situations. 

Any doubts about data security? Of course, we have
also considered that point. Your data will be stored anonymously and encrypted
on VIDAMETER. You will own your records in safe and protected/encrypted
formats. It is your data! So you are the only person that has access to this
data. You do, however, have the ability to share the data (e.g. with your
doctor, your friends) and only if you want to. To ensure that, we have been
working together with the world’s best computer programmers. In addition we
will organize a Hacker-contest, where the world’s best hackers are invited to
try to hack VIDAMETER. 

VIDAMETER is THE wearable device that supports you
in every moment of your life. It does not require you to have a smartphone, a
tablet or computer. It works completely independent. We do not want to give you
another electronic device, which you have to own to use VIDAMETER. But of
course you can analyses your data on the computer or your smartphone and use
different apps to make the best out of it. 

You handle VIDAMETER intuitively and easy via touchscreen. You can
switch with one finger through the simple menu. Clearly understandable icons
show you the different functions and give you further information about your
vital state. Through colour changing LED-strips on the edging of Vidameter you
will see at a glance how you are. A vibrating alert supports the whole. 


We
do not want to compare with others in regards to functions and possibilities or
even arrange a competition. What we really want is to help people to recognize
quickly, easily and without any effort, how they are - in every moment. We want
people to be active and fit - and know when they are overdoing it. We want to
save lives by giving the right help in time and that no longer anyone has to
wait for hours to be rescued. We know that it is already possible today, and
that all the time we are doing everything we can to realize our vision.
The
concept of VIDAMETER is unique! VIDAMETER integrates useful and life-saving
functions of the safety, fitness and health sector into one product and
replaces all currently available Fitness- and Activity-Trackers. In addition,
it simplifies your life through functions such as smart alarm, scanning or
cashless shopping. It
automatically adapts itself to your wrist like a second skin. It feels
completely natural and is hyperallergenic. A sophisticated security system
keeps your data personal and secret. You are the only one, who can access the
data and make the best out of it. 

VIDAMETER
is there for you in every moment to capture your well-being and save your life.
It is the all-in-one smartband that really cares how you are! That is our
promise and we find that makes the decisive added value for you and everyone
else!

For the
further forward-looking development of VIDAMETER, we have created a special
Developer-Package. We are sure, that there are boundless possibilities for the
use of VIDAMETER. Addressing this, we would love to see how you make use of the
VIDAMETER technology and find ways to adapt VIDAMETER even more to the needs of
its wearers. Regardless of whether cool APPS, better sensors, unknown
applications, we want YOU to build the world around VIDAMETER. 

Developers are welcome –  Get SDK, documentation, prototype and
support!
Our SDK
will provide you access to the complete software and all sensors. Furthermore
you will get our documentation as well as a fully operative prototype of VIDAMETER and support from us via our e-mail developer@vidamet.com
VIDAMETER combines a unique sensor technology with fully automatic emergency alerting. 9 unique
sensors and a countless number of different technologies form the heart of VIDAMETER. 

We all bring unique expertise—from medicine to sensor
technology to product design:

….   - Programmer (SDK and Sensor Development)
to be announced
Pool of international experts (medicine, sports, media etc.)
What unites us is the desire to provide with VIDAMETER
a product that focus on the well-being of each individual and put it back into
the center of everyone’s life vision. We want that VIDAMETER is the only
devices people need to do what they love, all day long. 
We achieve this with an understanding of the human body, competence in
the field of health protection and assistance and care and precision in the
execution of our comprehensive, multidisciplinary, technical product solution VIDAMETER.

Impulse for the idea of VIDAMETER
was an accident in April 2013, where a young man had to wait for rescue for
more than 8 hours in vain and that only 300 meters away from his home. Nobody
heard his shouts, nobody noticed him and initially nobody missed him. 
Since this incident, we were
profoundly convinced, that in this day and age, it could not be that one has to
wait for such a long time to get first aid. We wanted to change that! 
Subsequently our team has been spending a lot of time, work, money and care
on the development of VIDAMETER and engaging in all processes such as product
design, engineering, software programming, production planning or logistics.
We have gathered thousands of
personal consumer insights and stories of fate. We have talked to a handful of
experts who are specialised in sensor technology and programming, software
development and medicine and nursing and to members of diverse professional
groups like emergency medical or fire services. And we tried to find ideal development partners
for the future realization of VIDAMETER. 
Based on all these activities
we defined VIDAMETER’s customer value, we made a feasibility study, set the
sensor technology and the design and build a first electronic prototype. Now we
are at the ready and with your support it is possible that VIDAMETER becomes
reality!


We
have been working with manufacturers and carriers, so everything we need is now
in place. We have a team based in Austria where the whole production will
occur; we have partners around the world who believe in VIDAMETER and are
already working on the integration of VIDAMETER in their products. So we are
well prepared for our vision. 
Your support will allow us to
initiate production so we can make VIDAMETER available to you and to millions
of other people! 
Our aim with VIDAMETER is that
unpleasant and threatening conditions take no or little influence on the lives
of people, people stay fit and healthy and in an emergency, every precaution is
taken to guarantee a quick and smooth health care. Together – we can make our lives
healthier, safer and happier. 
So why should you support us?

VIDAMETER is the next evolution in measuring life. Be part of it!

VIDAMETER will provide you a holistic understanding of your
     well-being as never before and give you incredible insights into your
     body. Take a look!

As you may know, a project is a targeted, one-time undertaking, which consists of a set of coordinated and controlled activities with
start and finish dates. Most commonly, a project
is performed by taking
into account risks in terms of
time, resources (eg money or
costs or production) and quality to achieve the defined goal. 
The same is true to the VIDAMETER project. We have the
aim to launch a product in late 2015, which measures the well-being of everyone
and so improve, lengthen and save countless lives. Although we have drawn up a
consistent and conclusive project plan, we also face risks and challenges, which
we try to minimize with different actions taken by us and your support:
CHALLENGE NO 1
– Production
Due to the
newness and the small seize of the components in VIDAMETER we are initially depending
on a handful of producers who are specialised in sensor technology. At present
it is still too cost-intensive to produce the required sensors by our own. 
How do we meet this challenge? To avoid potential bottlenecks we purchase
the components in quantity less expensive. Furthermore we try to be in close
dialogue with the critical producers and build up a long-standing business
relation with them to ensure the constant supply. As start-up we can provide
them the necessary flexibility and possibility to test their innovations in
real and get quick and accurate results. In the long term, however, we would
like to produce the required components on our own in Austria and thus generate
new jobs, contribute to the net product of Austria and stimulate the regional
economy. 
Your support will help us to make all this possible more
powerful and quicker. On the back of your help we are able to negotiate better
terms for the resources and we are able to start the production in Austria
earlier. 
CHALLENGE NO 2 
– Data
Another challenge
is the data for the programming. We need precise and consistent data to
finetune the software programming, because software is only as good as the
data, it is processing. This is why live tests are very important to us to get
real data of different persons. 
How do we meet this challenge? All members of our team will wear a VIDAMETER
at every moment and keep records of their vital states. In addition we have
already attracted support from a professional stunt crew who will wear
VIDAMETER while doing stunts like accidents, spills and much more and a
professional porno production team who will wear VIDAMETER during their
shootings. In this way we can analyse data from different and uncommon
situations. 
With your support we still get more of the required data out
of daily life! You could be one of our 1000 BETA-Testers who are content to
wear VIDAMETER at every moment and measure their vital data. With your help and
your data we could get the most out of the VIDAMETER project.
CHALLENGE NO 3 –
Data security
Data security
is a very important issue for us! In
times of Heartbleed, the NSA spying scandal, Whatsapp or Facebook we are
mindful of data security by all means. We want that
your data stays private and is protected in the best possible way. 
How do we meet this challenge? Prior to our launch of VIDAEMTER we are
organizing a hacker-contest with the world’s best hackers to ensure the best
possible data privacy. If they succeed in hacking VIDAMETER, we would be able to
determine any security gaps in advance and close them fastest possible to have
one of the safest products in the world.
By supporting our campaign and pre-ordering
your VIDAMETER you will be
part of our revolution, which counteracts the surveillance state, certain
social media platforms that are acting like a modern STASI and global
technology players who deceive you with their marketing campaigns and their
lifestyle products to soak you and to make money out of your data. 
CHALLENGE NO 4 –
Time
Since summer 2013, our team has been spending a lot of
time, work, money and care on the development of VIDAMETER and engaging in all
processes such as feasibility studies, product design, production planning or
logistics.So far we have done 8 months of groundwork for
VIDAMETER. Now all we need is in place and we are on the verge of realizing our
vision! We are ready to pursue our tough and comprehensive plan by the end of
2015.
How do we meet this challenge? We know that our project plan takes up a lot
of time (18 months). Please be sure, that our plan is well-wrought, all steps
are elaborated and each hour of work is worth it! We are convinced that quality
needs its time. That is why the delivery of VIDAMETER needs a little bit more
time than that of others products. But only thus we can promise that you will
get your VIDAMETER without delays and at the best quality. 
You can help us with your confidence, your patience and your
participation! We would be happy to get your support and your feedback to our
product and our ideas. Get in touch with us on hello@vidamet.com. 
If you have any
further questions regarding the risks and challenges in the VIDAMETER project,
please to not hesitate to contact us. We would love to justify ourselves to
you!

How long do I have warranty on VIDAMETER?
The warranty for VIDAMETER is 2 years from date of shipment and include
updates and replacement, in the event that your VIDAMETER is defective. We will
also grant you the right of return VIDAMETER withing 30 days from delivery when
you are not statisfied with it. Without giving any reasons you will get your
money back .
Are the functions of VIDAMETER patented?
Single functions of VIDAMETER, such as the automatic emergency alarm
including transmission of vital data of the person in need, have already been patented.
Many more features are to be patented right now (patent application pending). We
can not continuously protect our product from imitators with these patents, but
so we can prevent that similar products are coming to the market that have been
made with less care and quality, and are not such a well-conceived product as VIDAMETER
.
Can I do any activities with VIDAMETER?
Swimming, climbing, boxing, etc.?
Yes, VIDAMETER is designed that it accompanies you in every situation and
does not hinder or bother you. Whether in your daily routine activities such as
showering or cleaning the house, in your sport activities such as tennis,
swimming, or climbing, or in exceptional cases such as an accident, VIDAMETER
is there for you in every moment.
How shock resistant and waterproof is VIDAMETER?
Fire, water, earth or air can not harm VIDAMETER. It is scratch-resistant
and shock-proof, water-resistant up to 300 meters and operates without problems
in a temperature range of -40 to +80 degrees Celsius.
Can I use VIDAMETER together with my
smartphone?
Basically VIDAMETER is fully self-contained. We do not want to give you an
additional device, which you then can use only in connection with your
smartphone, your tablet or your PC. Of course, there are APPs for VIDAMETER
developed by us and partners, with which you can make settings and reports
directly on your smartphone.Why can I pre-order my VIDAMETER only by credit card?As you may know, Indiegogo offers two option for contributing to Crowdfunding projects. You can either pay by credit card or with PayPal. We only opted for the payment by credit card. We strictly deny PayPal due to reasons related to data protection, reports of problems with the outpayments in other projects and hidden additional costs for you and us, too. Of course, we want to make your transfer of funds as easy as possible. So if you have not a credit card or you do not have the possibility to pre-order your VIDAMETER by prepaid card, please write us an email to hello@vidamet.com. We will find a solution for this issue. As we have a flexible funding, we will keep what we raise anyway and do not get all or nothing.
What if I am not satisfied with VIDAMETER?
Then you simple write us a mail and explain us why you are not satisfied.
Either we can solve your dissatisfaction together or you send us your VIDAMETER
back and get your money in return.
How is the comfort (right size, skin
compatibility, etc.) of VIDAMETER?
The optimal wearing comfort is made possible through the memory effect in the
polymerwristband. Polymer has the charateristic to remember states, therefore
VIDAMETER is like a second skin around your wrist. So it feels natural and is completely
hypoallergenic thanks to the 100 % recyclable material polymer. VIDAMETER does
not require a suitable lock. It automatically adaptts to your wrist , so it can
not fall off or be pulled off of your arm, even in extreme situations.
Can I program VIDAMETER autonomosly?
You can easily make settings (time and date setting , weight, and age etc.
) for your VIDAMETER. This can be done directly on the screen for which you do
not need any programming skills to do so. But if you are comfortable with
programming, you can also develop your own app for VIDAMETER. More information
can be found under the Developer section.


How is my health status displayed?
Your health status will be shown directly on the display of VIDAMETER. Easy
understandable icons indicate you how you are and give you short information
about your vital state. In addition, colored LED lights on the edge of
VIDAMETER display your status, thus, you can see at a glance how you are doing.
Long-term evaluations of your health can be made on your smartphone, tablet or
PC.
Do I have to enter my data (weight, age,
etc. ) into VIDAMETER by myself?
No, you do not have to enter these settings by yourself. We will be happy
to help you if you send us your basic data. However, we believe that you can
easily even successfully perform the settings by the simple and intuitive operation
of VIDAMETER. On our website www.vidameter.com is a video tutorial available in
which you all will be explained in detail and easy to understand , in case you
need help.
Can I provide my data for my doctor?
Your data belongs to you! You have them available in a safe, secure and
encrypted format. You can give your doctor the information he needs, only if
you want to. It is your choice and we assume no liability for it. You can
decide this with the simple click on your PC before you print the data or save them
on your USB stick.
How much will VIDAMETER cost? 
VIDAMETER will be available on the market at a retail price of € 349 EUR, £ 289
GBP or $ 479 USD in DECEMBER 2015. We deliver VIDAMETER with a description in analog and digital
form and the relevant software for Windows Phone, Windows Desktop, Android and
iOS. Unfortunately, the shipping costs have to paid by you. 
Can I customize the design of VIDAMETER individually? 
VIDAMETER is available in various colors. In addtion, we can muster any
kind of design on the smartband and so vote your VIDAMETER individually for
you. Either you send us your template or theme that you would liked to have,
and our design team designs your custom design, or you can take pot luck. The
additional charge for this service is € 69 EUR,  £ 59 GBP, $ 89 USD.
 Is the size of the smartband
adjustable? 
VIDAMETER is available in 3 different lengths. This ensures that everyone will get its VIDAMETER in the appropriate size. It perfectly adjusts to
your wrist and hugs it smootly so that the sensors are located in the right place. This is why you will have
no problem that your VIDAMETER is too
tight or too loose. It feels
like a second skin.
How can I make sure that all sensors of VIDAMETER work properly?
VIDAMETER makes a self-test every 24 hours. Provided that VIDAMETER detects
that a sensor is faulty in this test, you will receive a message on the display
.How does VIDAMETER work in an emergency?VIDAMETER's nine sensors recognize an emergency from the change of your vital data. If you are unconscious or injured, VIDAMETER automatically sends an emergency call and informs up to 10 pre-defined persons or institutions via encrypted SMS, MMS or E-Mail (you have the possibility to predefine it). This message contains data of your location and your vital state. As soon as the recipient opens the message, the data appears on the mobile phone display as a snapshot. The received data will not be stored on the mobile phone of the recipient. Should your vital state change, a new message is sent. We are working with a partner with whom it is possible to send the data in any part of the world, even without a mobile reception.
Where will I get a VIDAMETER after the official market launch?
We will distribute VIDAMETER directly through our online store on www.vidameter.com after the Indiegogo-Campaign. On the one hand this saves you money and on the other one we can offer you
the best support and the ideal consulting which are necessary. Because we best know
our product.
How is the best possible data security guaranteed?
Unfortunately we cannot guarantee a data security of 100 %. But we will do
everything for it to give you the best possible security. We employ the best
programmers and annually organize a hacker-contest in which the best hackers in
the world will try to hack VIDAMETER. So we can identify potential data leaks
and close them immediately, even before you will get your VIDAMETER!
Does VIDAMETER measure my vital signs
anytime, anywhere ?
Yes, the bracelet is measuring your vital signs discreetly and quietly at
every moment. Only this way is it possible to detect irregularities and
""hidden"" diseases in time and prevent it. The same applies in case of
accidents and other health ailments. The more often the vital signs are
measured and faster you know that your body is not doing well, the faster and
easier you can be helped.
Why does VIDAMETER cost € 349 EUR, £ 289 GBP or $ 479 USD?
VIDAMETER is unique! It integrates useful and life-saving functions of the
safety , fitness and health sector into one product and replaces all currently
available Fitness and Activity-Trackers. In addition, it simplifies your life through
functions such as smart alarm, scanning or cashless shopping. VIDAMETER is
there in every moment to capture your well-being and save your life. We find
that makes the decisive added value!

How long is the useful life of VIDAMETER?
We estimate a useful life of 5 to 10 years as the average lifespan of the
sensors and components integrated in VIDAMETER is about as long . We can make long-term
tests as soon as VIDAMETER is available on the market in greater quantity.
Can I upgrade to the Developer Package?
Of course this is also possible! As long as developer packages are
available on Indiegogo , you can get your Developer Package from us. Working
together with developers is important for us and we do not want to create the
world around VIDAMETER all alone. We will provide Developer packages even after
the Indiegogo campaign. But then to slightly changed conditions.


Can I obtain VIDAMETER prescriped from my doctor or is
there any support from the health insurances?
At the present time we are not ready that VIDAMETER is integrated into the
national health systems. But we are working on it. With your support, we
already go one-step further.
Can I transfer data such as information
about my blood type, allergies, etc. to my VIDAMETER?
Yes, you can also store personal information on your VIDAMETER. Here we
will help you. Because in order to provide data security, they should be
encrypted. It is important for us that your information is correct and can be quickly
accessed at the crucial moment.
Can I measure my blood pressure with
VIDAMETER too?
Yes, this is possible. The blood pressure cannot only be measured by a sphygmomanometer.
This is also possible by ultrasonic. While the blood pressure monitor measures
only the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, the overall trend of the blood
pressure can be measured by ultrasonic. This is much more accurate and
meaningful.
When will VIDAMETER be available?
According to our plan we will start to deliver VIDAMETER to our 1000
Beta-Testers in JULY 2015. In NOVEMBER 2015 all our supporters on Indiegogo
will get their preordered VIDAMETER. Finally, in DECEMBER 2015 VIDAMETER will
be available on the market. 
How can I be sure that you stick to your production plan?
We looked at other successful funded past projects and understand your
resentment and doubts when products are shipped partially 3 years after the
scheduled date of delivery to the supporters. To ensure that our production
schedule is met, we have calculated very accurately, installed appropriate
slack times and tried to secure critical production steps as far as possible.
We produce by ourselves and already have fixed commitments for the sensors from
our partners, so nothing stand in the way to met the production plan. Should
everything run really perfectly and according to plan, we would even be ready
three months prior to the scheduled delivery date (November 2015) and you will
get your VIDAMETER earlier. We do not promise that, but strive to achieve this
goal.After the beta testing phase, will the VIDAMETER I have be the same as the released product?All
 Beta-testers will get a fully operative VIDAMETER. It will have the 
same functionality like that of the Early Birds and the released 
product, because after the Beta-tests we will upgrade them with the 
latest software update (we upgrade all algorithms and fix all problems).
 The Beta-tests are the most important to adapt VIDAMETER to the needs of its potential wearers at best possible.
 They will help us to finetune VIDAMETER. It could be that the sensors 
in the Beta-VIDAMETER will have different versions compared to the 
released product, but this is in consequence of general further 
development. You will not notice any differences in context to the 
functionality. The warranty for all Beta-VIDAMETERs is limited to 1 year from date of shipment and include 
updates and replacement, in the event that your VIDAMETER is defective.",43.0,0,"1 Campaign
