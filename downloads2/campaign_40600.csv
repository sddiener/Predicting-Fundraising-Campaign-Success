<p>Most of us are aware of the growing food crisis and the companies that are attempting to take over land and seed and the suffering it is causing.  Fighting Monsanto is great, but designing and planting our own food forests right where we live and work is more fun! and much more realistic than waiting around for someone else to decide when we can stop feeding ourselves and our children poison. I want to help at the grassroots level where people are doing our best to eat organic, nutrient-dense foods.</p>
<h3>How is this possible? <strong>THE RIPPLE EFFECT.</strong>

<h2><strong>STEP 1: Learn from the experts!</strong></h2>
<p>I’ve learned so much in the past 10 years, from my own gardening, and especially from experts like Soil Foodweb scientist Elaine Ingham, but haven’t had the opportunity to take a permaculture design course and apply the principles. I was SO INSPIRED by Geoff Lawton’s methods that I started creating this Indiegogo campaign the night I saw his video on urban permaculture in micro-spaces.</p>

<p>I currently have access to two properties in the San Francisco Bay Area with plenty of opportunity to create a food forest. They are conveniently within 30 minutes of each other near the foothills of Mount Diablo.</p>
<p><strong><em>Your donation will help me learn and apply the knowledge to actual sites as well as gain access to an international community of permaculture designers!</em></strong></p>
<h2><strong>STEP 3: REPEAT</strong></h2>
<p>Help as many people as possible create their own, reasonably-priced, low-maintenance, sustainable organic food forest with systems that will secure health and well-being.</p>
<p><strong><em>Your donation is the first step to a bigger dream of being of service to the people who need food, beauty, and connection to the earth. </em></strong></p>

<p><b>Agriculture is once again being rejected also in terms of perception</b>: the young generations of the 60s and 70s begin to dream of a different life, freed from agriculture.

<p>Trying to have a closer view on the agricultural sector ability to support the consumption (food resources, textile fibers, bio-fuels), we notice that <b>Italy</b>, like other countries of early industrialization, <b>consumes more than its agricultural soil can produce.</b> </p>
<h4>Italy is the 3rd country in the EU for its deficit of agricultural land and the 5th worldwide.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/761840/files/20140802144559-landimport-01.jpg?1407015959"" src="""" style=""""/><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The loss of land is caused by 2 main factors: </span>land abandonment and soil sealing<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">. Soil sealing is the covering of land with ""waterproof"" materials as concrete, metal, glass, asphalt, plastic in such a way as to prevent the ecological functions of soil. It is deeply rooted in the economic sphere: </span>the construction industry is one of the most stable and profitable.</h4>
<h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The ICI - a communal toll to be paid for real-estate property (1992) was, until 2008, one of the main entrances of the financial income of Italian municipalities. The trend is not reversed by the IMU - the new toll that replaced ICI. </span></h4>
<h4>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The same applies to the urbanization costs that municipalities receive from construction enterprises / individuals (higher rates for new buildings than for renovation). It is </span>not related to demographic trends<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">: the population since 1950 has increased by 28% while construction activity has increased by 166%. </span>
</h4>
<h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">It is a phenomenon spread over a social and cultural matrix that attributes little value to the environment, agriculture, while enhances the building activity in all its forms. </span></h4>

We are citizens, artists, farmers, architects differently involved in the phenomenon of the land abandonment. We want to consider the countryside beyond the agricultural production.

                   Imballaggio dell'uva da tavola ad Adelfia. Saverio Macchia, 1985We need your support for the following: • Open a stable art platform to re-use the rejected land as a cultural space;
• Realize the Agricultural Film Festival as the first moment of this platform (we need to rent specific materials/appliances for film screenings, workshops, music and art performances);
• Accomodation and fee for the artists, film directors, researchers invited;
• Publish the book which presents the entire process of research we are carrying on from several months now.

      Nicola Catella and Anila ShehajAGRICULTURE IS NOT A                           METAPHOR OF FAILURE !__________________________________________________In Italy, during the 30s and 40s, thousands of   peasants fought against big landowners who ignored suffering people and harsh reality.The fights for the redistribution of land, as the main economic sustenance for most of families, give life to the so-called grandi occupazioni* in South, but even in Central and North Italy.

                     *Occupazione delle terre incolte di Sicilia. Renato Guttuso, 1949

After World War II, Italy, as well as other European countries, has been experiencing an intense economic development period called boom economico, synonym of the new consumer society and new desires. 
Agriculture is once again being rejected also in terms of perception: the young generations of the 60s and 70s begin to dream of a different life, freed from agriculture. The myth of success, translated in being a lawyer, a doctor, being educated, becomes the new status symbol amongst wealthy farmers. This gets materialized in a physical and cultural migration.  
Today we see the results of these attempts: a lot of abandoned land and the remaining “field survivors” get tagged as “ignorant and useless, unable to be other than farmers”.







1979




2013

We're working to re-create connections between society and agriculture, city and countryside.



The project intentions are to involve the community of farmers, workers, young generations of landowners in a collective dialogue.





""We still cultivate the vineyards but when is time to recollect most of us don't do it anymore.""

                       RESEARCH


Trying to have a closer view on the agricultural sector ability to support the consumption (food resources, textile fibers, bio-fuels), we notice that Italy, like other countries of early industrialization, consumes more than its agricultural soil can produce. 
Italy is the 3rd country in the EU for its deficit of agricultural land and the 5th worldwide.The loss of land is caused by 2 main factors: land abandonment and soil sealing. Soil sealing is the covering of land with ""waterproof"" materials as concrete, metal, glass, asphalt, plastic in such a way as to prevent the ecological functions of soil. It is deeply rooted in the economic sphere: the construction industry is one of the most stable and profitable.
The ICI - a communal toll to be paid for real-estate property (1992) was, until 2008, one of the main entrances of the financial income of Italian municipalities. The trend is not reversed by the IMU - the new toll that replaced ICI. 

The same applies to the urbanization costs that municipalities receive from construction enterprises / individuals (higher rates for new buildings than for renovation). It is not related to demographic trends: the population since 1950 has increased by 28% while construction activity has increased by 166%. 

It is a phenomenon spread over a social and cultural matrix that attributes little value to the environment, agriculture, while enhances the building activity in all its forms.

</div></div>","Short summary

Hello....my name is Ofe and I am a firm believer that economy and environment go hand in hand and can help each other into making the world a better place. I have worked for environmental NGO's but always felt like a meaningful and constant change should be brought in people's mentality. They should be offered  tools for positive change and not just random events with little impact. So.... from 14th (yes Valentine's Day) February 2013 I started a project for collecting used cooking oil in student dormitories in Cluj-Napoca (the second largest city in Romania). I have bought buckets and containers for each kitchen in each dorm, signed collaboration contracts with all universities in the city, provided informative posters, held meetings and organized transportation. The project works and oil is constantly collected so that it reached 4 tons up till the present. In this way water, soil and pipes were saved. Also this precious resource was used to produce biodiesel an alternative fuel which reduces diesel fuel pollution with up to 70%.    

My dream went further and I have extended to two more cities: Oradea(my home town) and Suceava (my boyfriend's home town). 21 more university cities remain and then the next target is the whole population.
What I need?
Right now I am low on cash regarding transport and accomodation in these 21 cities. In Romania a round trip to any location costs about 24 euros which means 504 euros for 21 trips. Accomodation is around 20 euro (in a hostel) for 2 nights which is enought for me to sign the contract so this means 420 euros.  In total this means aproximately 1000 euros.  
The impact
 The impact will not only be on the environmental side it will also be on the social and educational one as these students will form a habbit of collecting and recycling resources. They will grow up as responsible adults who will pass this mentality to future generations. Because of their age their mannerisms are easily changed and modelled and it is important to do it in a positive way. 
I also believe that seeing this project they will have ideas for more and implement other useful initiatives.  
Risks and challenges


Of course collecting used cooking oil is not always easy as it is sticky, smelly, easily inflammable. If only a few students are not careful disasters could strike and the project could become extinct. It can also pollute more if small quantities are collected only, as fuel used for transportation also pollutes the environment.

Many universities are not receptive to the project as they believe that nothing can be done because students are iresponsible and careless and they cannot be educated in a few years if at home they lacked this element. 
All in all, it is worth trying because even if a few will always be conservative and problems will arise  the idea is to find new solutions and the obstacles are actually opportunities which guide us towards improvement. 
Other ways you can help
 Everyone can help and this initiative could be done in your own country I am open to ideas and experience sharing just contact me on ofelia.zaha@gmail.com. I can provide posters and study papers about used cooking oil. Also, if you want you can like the facebook page https://www.facebook.com/viridivos and share your own ideas which will always be useful and appreciated.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My name is Rachel Schneider and I am an 18 year old university student. 
My first year at university has been a bit of a hard one, and I've found
 myself struggling with depression these past few months. So I made the 
decision that I needed to change something in my life to make it better.
 Through the student volunteer program, ISV, I have been accepted to 
travel to Thailand this summer to work with abandoned, orphaned and 
abused elephants. As unbelievably excited as I am, I need as much help 
as I can get to make it there. Any small donations that you might be able to help me reach my goal would be much appreciated. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>The Asian elephant is 
disappearing in Thailand and ISV volunteers have been working with one 
of Asia's premier conservation parks to help save this amazing 
animal. Located in the north of Thailand, the park aims to care for 
elephants that have been rescued from forced labor under terrible 
conditions, the tourism industry, or as orphans.  The center cares for 
them, while contributing to the promotion of positive animal-based 
tourism and conservation. Volunteers help greatly with the operations of
 the center by feeding, bathing, and cleaning the elephants as well as 
maintaining and enriching their habitat and building new structures for 
park visitors. <br/><br/>
ISV partners with other rescue centers located in southern Thailand that
 focus on wild animals such as gibbons and macaques,  that were 
illegally poached for the pet trade and subsequently mistreated.  An 
overarching goal is to help prevent, educate and actively campaign 
against hunting and cruelty to wild animals. A specific aim is to 
rehabilitate these animals wherever possible and return them to the 
wild. .  Animals that are too disabled or injured to return to the wild 
are provided with long-term care to ensure their  survival. Volunteers 
provide vital assistance to the operation of these sanctuaries. As a 
volunteer your tasks include involvement with the daily cleaning rounds 
(cleaning feeding trays, enclosures etc.), educating visitors and 
general maintenance /light construction tasks around the sanctuary. In 
addition, animals may become stressed living in captivity: One of the 
most rewarding aspects is working on the enclosures, as volunteers are 
important contributors to Cenriching the enclosures with 
structures, games and other features designed to positively engage the 
animals to minimize their stress levels.  Volunteers also play an 
important part in  monitoring released gibbons; trekking through 
rainforest to record the behaviors of these wild animals is an 
experience of a lifetime! <br/><br/>
One of the key components to maximizing our achievements and creating a 
lasting impact in Thailand is that on each wildlife conservation 
project, ISV volunteers do more than just work with animals. Volunteers 
have also spent time helping to educate tourists and locals along 
popular tourist beaches, visiting local schools and reaching out to 
communities. In Hill Tribe villages, volunteers assist with community 
development projects (building roads, toilet blocks, water tanks, etc.),
 educating local communities (e.g., teaching English, educating about 
illegal poaching, conservation and humane animal practices, etc.) and 
encouraging sustainable development practices. Outreach and development 
is a big component of all of our volunteer projects and when combined 
with serious conservation efforts, it creates a lasting impact.<br/>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>When it comes down to specific price breakdowns, the trip itself cost <span class=""georgia h2 push_left_20 yellowGreen"">6,412.00 for four weeks traveling and volunteering in Thailand. What ever I can get from 
friends, family and cooperation will be going directly to fund my trip. 
Whatever I can't make, I will be spending the money myself. But 5 
dollars from a friend or even a stranger will help me make my way. <br/></span></p>

the most important bee that Americans never heard of almost died out.  Last year, we found some in a completely
unexpected place.  They may be coming
back, and we may be able to help – but we need to move quickly.</b></p>
<p><b>Help us find out.</b></p>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Everyone knows that the bees are hurting.  The news is full of colony collapse, empty
hives, and the crazy prices that farmers have to pay to pollinate their crops.</p>
<p>Fewer people know that, when it comes to pollination,
honeybees are not the only game in town. 
In fact, they are an alien species in North America: they arrived with European
settlers.  Before that, the Americas and
the fruits, berries, and vegetables that grew here – tomatoes, peppers,
blueberries, squash – did just fine with the local talent.  Many of them actually do better when they’re
visited by native bees.</p>
<p>There are several thousand species of bee in North
America.  Some of them are hurting,
too.  Some of them are doing fine.  With few exceptions, no one really knows
which are which.</p>
<p>In 1990, the Western Bumblebee (<i>Bombus occidentalis</i>) was doing fine.  It was widespread and abundant, and was
probably the most important native pollinator west of the Rockies.  There was even a serious effort to
domesticate it, to keep colonies alive year-round in greenhouses, to provide
fresh heirloom tomatoes in February.</p>
<p>Ten years later, most of them were dead.</p>
<h2>My Story</h2>
<p>My name is Will Peterman. 
I’m a photographer, writer, engineer, and native bee nerd, and when I
came to the Pacific Northwest, the biologists I met talked about the Western
Bumblebee in tones I had previously heard in conversations about
Bigfoot.  Most of them had never seen
one.  When a corpse turned up in a suburb
near the airport, it was big news.  <i>We
found one!</i></p>
<p>It was just the one, though. 
Subsequent searches turned up nothing; additional traps stayed
empty.  No one saw one alive – until last
year.</p>
<p>I am also the guy who <a href=""http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2021395297_bumblebeesxml.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">found the first lowland population of Western Bumblebees since the collapse</a>.  I have been studying them ever since, along with researchers from the University of Washington, the US Department of Agriculture, and the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation.  As far as we can tell, they’re doing fine, and that means that something
has changed.  These bees are (probably)
different, somehow, from the ones that are hanging on in the remote corners of
the West, and if we move quickly – if we get cell samples from the new bees and
the old ones, before the new population has time to spread, or to die – there’s
an excellent chance that we’ll be able to figure out what the difference is.</p>
<p>If we can do that, we may be able to save some bees.</p>
<h2>Cell Samples and Endangered Bees</h2>
<p><i>“How can you collect
cell samples from an endangered species? 
Doesn’t that kill the bee?” – Everybody</i></p>
<p>I’m glad you asked! 
The answer is, no, it doesn’t. 
The USDA has developed a cell collection technique that only
trims a few milligrams off of one of the middle legs.  Since we’re not collecting the rest of the
bee, it’s very important to keep a detailed photographic record of the
individuals we catch: that’s where I come in. 
It isn’t quite a specimen on a pin, but it works – and it doesn’t hurt
the bee.</p>
<p>(Full disclosure: thanks to a genetic quirk that is unique
to bees and their relatives, male bumblebees don’t contribute very much to the
health or survival of their nests.  We will
occasionally collect a few in order to test for certain parasites and
diseases.)</p>
<h1>What We Need</h1>
<h2>The first $12,000</h2>
<p>The first $12,000 pays for a really long road trip.  In three months, we will collect samples from
local populations in California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming,
Colorado, New Mexico, and (time, weather, and customs permitting) British
Columbia.  We’ll visit many of them
twice.</p>
<p>Here’s the breakdown:</p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Hardware: $1500. 
The big ticket items are a 12 volt freezer, a backup battery, and a
weather meter.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Gas: $2300.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Food: $4800 (assuming there are three
volunteers.)</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Maintenance: $900.  Tires, windshield wipers, and whatever else
wears out on a 10 year old truck.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Specimen handling: $500.  Mostly packaging, dry ice, and overnight shipping.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Housing: $1000. 
Camping by the truck builds character, but some nights you need to sleep
indoors.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Surprises: $1000.  I don’t know what else will go wrong during
three months on the road, but something probably will.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul><p></p>
<h3>Buy the road trip, get the genetic analysis free!</h3>
<p>One of the many reasons to support this project is that if
we can pay for the data collection, the next step is already paid for!  The cell samples will be stored and analyzed
under an existing program at the USDA.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/619959/files/20140602050353-team.jpg?1401710633"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Our Team</p><p></p><h2>If we fall short</h2>
<p>This is a fixed funding campaign: if we can’t pay for food,
gas, and a freezer, we can’t go.  In
practical terms, that means that if we reach the end of June and the $12,000
goal is still in serious doubt, we will cancel the campaign, thank our
supporters, and find something else to do.</p>
<h2>If we get more</h2>
<p>$12,000 is the minimum we think we need in order to make the
trip.  More will help!</p>
<p>Here are our ambitions, in rough order of importance:</p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Extended trip: $2300.  We’d like to sample some local populations in
Alaska, but it will take a lot of gas…</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Expenses and materials for the Rich Site Team:
$1000.  The road team isn’t the only one
working this summer.  The Rich Site team
is developing the techniques that we’ll use in the field next year.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Replacement photo gear: $5000.  We’re currently using my personal
camera.  It’s a reasonably durable beast,
but six years in the field have taken their toll, and the bee lens isn’t
weather sealed.  A second camera and lens
would eliminate our biggest point of failure, and improve our documentary
images.  As a bonus, for our next project,
we wouldn’t be limited to still images on our campaign page!  (Not that she isn’t cute.)</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Housing: $1000. 
More time sleeping indoors…</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Stipend: 
$9000.  You may have noticed that
we haven’t said anything about covering our rent!  We may be crazy volunteers (OK, we basically
are) but it would be nice to cover some personal expenses.  This would cover $250 per week for each member of
the road team.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>Beyond that, any additional funds will go to one or more of the
following worthy ends (hey, we can dream):</p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Next year’s field work.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">The University of Washington beekeeping
internship program.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Field guide-quality photographs of native bees
(and, ultimately, a field guide to put them in.)</span><br/>
</li>
</ul><p></p>
<h1>What You Get</h1>
<h2>Science!</h2>
<p>If we collect the data we mean to collect, we will be able
to determine how the different local populations of Western Bumblebees are
related to one another.  The odds are
good that we will also be able to tell how the recovering populations in the
Puget Sound area differ from the others.</p>
<p>In turn, that should tell us something about:</p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Whether we’re looking at bees that are getting
stronger, or a disease that’s getting weaker</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Which disease killed them in the first place</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">How they’re reacting to it</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Whether the bees we call ""Western Bumblebees"" are really all a single species, or are actually more than one</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">How accurate our pollinator surveys have been
for the past twenty years.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul><p></p>
<h2>Tomatoes!</h2>
<p>Twenty years ago, the original plan to raise Western
bumblebees in greenhouses collapsed when all their bees died.  If we are able to identify the disease that
killed them, and how they have begun to recover in spite of it, we could start
seeing some cheap winter tomatoes after all.</p>
<h2>Honey!</h2>
<p>The chief suspect in the collapse of the Western Bumblebee
is a microsporidian parasite called <i>Nosema
bombi</i>.  It is closely related to two
others, <i>Nosema apis</i> and <i>Nosema ceranae</i>, that are major killers
of commercial honeybees.  If the local
bumblebees have begun to adapt to <i>Nosema</i>
infection, we may learn how to improve the health of honeybees as well.</p>
<h2>Perks!</h2>
<p>We’ll be adding more perks over the course of the campaign,
but so far, we’re dividing them into two general categories: <b>Things with bees on them</b> and <b>Pollinator art</b>.</p>
<h3>Things with bees on them</h3>
<p>We have a nice library of original photographs of native
bees and other pollinators, and we’ll be offering different ways to share those
images with our supporters.</p>
<p>To begin with, we’re creating a set of a dozen high quality
postcards, each with a different species of pollinator that is native to the
Pacific Northwest.  They are available
individually and as a set.  In addition,
if you are looking for another way to stay in touch with the road team as the
project unfolds, they are available postmarked – from the road!  When we’re planning to pass by a mailbox, we’ll
write some notes and drop them in the mail. 
If you sign up for the whole set that way, you’ll wind up collecting a
road diary!</p>
<h3>Pollinator Art</h3>
<p>Again, we’ll be adding perks as the project progresses, but
we have a few good ones to start with.</p>
<h4>Canvas Prints</h4>
<p>We are offering gallery-quality fine art prints on stretched
canvas.  They are digital prints that are
stretched and finished by hand, and they are available in several sizes.  The first few prints are from my last gallery
show, but I will make more as needed.  (Note: I probably won’t make any prints
between the middle of June and the end of the road trip.  Expect delivery of most canvas prints in
September.)</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/619961/files/20140602050605-Andrena.jpg?1401710765"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/619963/files/20140602050639-Megachile.jpg?1401710799"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><h4>Bee on a Rock</h4>

<p></p></div>","In the late 1990s,
the most important bee that Americans never heard of almost died out.  Last year, we found some in a completely
unexpected place.  They may be coming
back, and we may be able to help – but we need to move quickly.
Help us find out.
Introduction
Everyone knows that the bees are hurting.  The news is full of colony collapse, empty
hives, and the crazy prices that farmers have to pay to pollinate their crops.
Fewer people know that, when it comes to pollination,
honeybees are not the only game in town. 
In fact, they are an alien species in North America: they arrived with European
settlers.  Before that, the Americas and
the fruits, berries, and vegetables that grew here – tomatoes, peppers,
blueberries, squash – did just fine with the local talent.  Many of them actually do better when they’re
visited by native bees.
There are several thousand species of bee in North
America.  Some of them are hurting,
too.  Some of them are doing fine.  With few exceptions, no one really knows
which are which.
In 1990, the Western Bumblebee (Bombus occidentalis) was doing fine.  It was widespread and abundant, and was
probably the most important native pollinator west of the Rockies.  There was even a serious effort to
domesticate it, to keep colonies alive year-round in greenhouses, to provide
fresh heirloom tomatoes in February.
Ten years later, most of them were dead.
My Story
My name is Will Peterman. 
I’m a photographer, writer, engineer, and native bee nerd, and when I
came to the Pacific Northwest, the biologists I met talked about the Western
Bumblebee in tones I had previously heard in conversations about
Bigfoot.  Most of them had never seen
one.  When a corpse turned up in a suburb
near the airport, it was big news.  We
found one!
It was just the one, though. 
Subsequent searches turned up nothing; additional traps stayed
empty.  No one saw one alive – until last
year.
I am also the guy who found the first lowland population of Western Bumblebees since the collapse.  I have been studying them ever since, along with researchers from the University of Washington, the US Department of Agriculture, and the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation.  As far as we can tell, they’re doing fine, and that means that something
has changed.  These bees are (probably)
different, somehow, from the ones that are hanging on in the remote corners of
the West, and if we move quickly – if we get cell samples from the new bees and
the old ones, before the new population has time to spread, or to die – there’s
an excellent chance that we’ll be able to figure out what the difference is.
If we can do that, we may be able to save some bees.
Cell Samples and Endangered Bees
“How can you collect
cell samples from an endangered species? 
Doesn’t that kill the bee?” – Everybody
I’m glad you asked! 
The answer is, no, it doesn’t. 
The USDA has developed a cell collection technique that only
trims a few milligrams off of one of the middle legs.  Since we’re not collecting the rest of the
bee, it’s very important to keep a detailed photographic record of the
individuals we catch: that’s where I come in. 
It isn’t quite a specimen on a pin, but it works – and it doesn’t hurt
the bee.
(Full disclosure: thanks to a genetic quirk that is unique
to bees and their relatives, male bumblebees don’t contribute very much to the
health or survival of their nests.  We will
occasionally collect a few in order to test for certain parasites and
diseases.)
What We Need
The first $12,000
The first $12,000 pays for a really long road trip.  In three months, we will collect samples from
local populations in California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming,
Colorado, New Mexico, and (time, weather, and customs permitting) British
Columbia.  We’ll visit many of them
twice.
Here’s the breakdown:


Hardware: $1500. 
The big ticket items are a 12 volt freezer, a backup battery, and a
weather meter.


Gas: $2300.


Food: $4800 (assuming there are three
volunteers.)


Maintenance: $900.  Tires, windshield wipers, and whatever else
wears out on a 10 year old truck.


Specimen handling: $500.  Mostly packaging, dry ice, and overnight shipping.


Housing: $1000. 
Camping by the truck builds character, but some nights you need to sleep
indoors.


Surprises: $1000.  I don’t know what else will go wrong during
three months on the road, but something probably will.


Buy the road trip, get the genetic analysis free!
One of the many reasons to support this project is that if
we can pay for the data collection, the next step is already paid for!  The cell samples will be stored and analyzed
under an existing program at the USDA.Our TeamIf we fall short
This is a fixed funding campaign: if we can’t pay for food,
gas, and a freezer, we can’t go.  In
practical terms, that means that if we reach the end of June and the $12,000
goal is still in serious doubt, we will cancel the campaign, thank our
supporters, and find something else to do.
If we get more
$12,000 is the minimum we think we need in order to make the
trip.  More will help!
Here are our ambitions, in rough order of importance:


Extended trip: $2300.  We’d like to sample some local populations in
Alaska, but it will take a lot of gas…


Expenses and materials for the Rich Site Team:
$1000.  The road team isn’t the only one
working this summer.  The Rich Site team
is developing the techniques that we’ll use in the field next year.


Replacement photo gear: $5000.  We’re currently using my personal
camera.  It’s a reasonably durable beast,
but six years in the field have taken their toll, and the bee lens isn’t
weather sealed.  A second camera and lens
would eliminate our biggest point of failure, and improve our documentary
images.  As a bonus, for our next project,
we wouldn’t be limited to still images on our campaign page!  (Not that she isn’t cute.)


Housing: $1000. 
More time sleeping indoors…


Stipend: 
$9000.  You may have noticed that
we haven’t said anything about covering our rent!  We may be crazy volunteers (OK, we basically
are) but it would be nice to cover some personal expenses.  This would cover $250 per week for each member of
the road team.


Beyond that, any additional funds will go to one or more of the
following worthy ends (hey, we can dream):


Next year’s field work.


The University of Washington beekeeping
internship program.


Field guide-quality photographs of native bees
(and, ultimately, a field guide to put them in.)


What You Get
Science!
If we collect the data we mean to collect, we will be able
to determine how the different local populations of Western Bumblebees are
related to one another.  The odds are
good that we will also be able to tell how the recovering populations in the
Puget Sound area differ from the others.
In turn, that should tell us something about:


Whether we’re looking at bees that are getting
stronger, or a disease that’s getting weaker


Which disease killed them in the first place


How they’re reacting to it

Whether the bees we call ""Western Bumblebees"" are really all a single species, or are actually more than one

How accurate our pollinator surveys have been
for the past twenty years.


Tomatoes!
Twenty years ago, the original plan to raise Western
bumblebees in greenhouses collapsed when all their bees died.  If we are able to identify the disease that
killed them, and how they have begun to recover in spite of it, we could start
seeing some cheap winter tomatoes after all.
Honey!
The chief suspect in the collapse of the Western Bumblebee
is a microsporidian parasite called Nosema
bombi.  It is closely related to two
others, Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae, that are major killers
of commercial honeybees.  If the local
bumblebees have begun to adapt to Nosema
infection, we may learn how to improve the health of honeybees as well.
Perks!
We’ll be adding more perks over the course of the campaign,
but so far, we’re dividing them into two general categories: Things with bees on them and Pollinator art.
Things with bees on them
We have a nice library of original photographs of native
bees and other pollinators, and we’ll be offering different ways to share those
images with our supporters.
To begin with, we’re creating a set of a dozen high quality
postcards, each with a different species of pollinator that is native to the
Pacific Northwest.  They are available
individually and as a set.  In addition,
if you are looking for another way to stay in touch with the road team as the
project unfolds, they are available postmarked – from the road!  When we’re planning to pass by a mailbox, we’ll
write some notes and drop them in the mail. 
If you sign up for the whole set that way, you’ll wind up collecting a
road diary!
Pollinator Art
Again, we’ll be adding perks as the project progresses, but
we have a few good ones to start with.
Canvas Prints
We are offering gallery-quality fine art prints on stretched
canvas.  They are digital prints that are
stretched and finished by hand, and they are available in several sizes.  The first few prints are from my last gallery
show, but I will make more as needed.  (Note: I probably won’t make any prints
between the middle of June and the end of the road trip.  Expect delivery of most canvas prints in
September.)Bee on a Rock
I’m really excited about this one!  Award-winning miniatures painter Marike
Reimer has created and donated a special entry in her remarkable series, Bug on a Rock.  This one is a brilliantly rendered Western
Bumblebee queen, and I believe that it’s unique in that it is painted from memory:

(Seriously, this is pretty cool.  Marike doesn’t take commissions any more, and
my snarky tone is a poorly concealed effort to stave off the mini hordes until I
can scrounge enough to get it myself. 
That’s legal, right?)Other Ways to Help
Even if you can’t donate, there are a number of ways to help
the project, and bumblebees in general. 
Here are a few:

pesticides.  Even in a city, a good

<div class=""clear""> </div>
<p>In the <strong>Off Grid Project</strong> I will show you how to get your household fully off the grid and independent from the power and utility companies. Never pay for electricity, water or sewer again.</p>
<p>With the rising oil prices, many people are looking for alternative forms of energy. Until now, alternate energy has been too expensive for most people. It takes about 20 years for solar to pay for itself. Windmills are very expensive and require professional installers. We are tied to the grid.</p>
<p>Or are we....</p>
<p>Do It Yourselfers can get off the grid for a fraction of the cost of retail systems. I will show you how to become energy independent on a budget. You can have your own solar power, windmill, water supply, sewage, heat, hot water and cooling system - for $5,000.</p>
<p>Or, pick and choose what best suits your needs and budget.</p>
<p>The project will proceed regardless of the amount of funding, so contributors will be guaranteed their rewards.</p>
<h1>Energy</h1>
<p>I will show you how to make your own solar panels at 1/10th the cost of retail. You will learn how to choose the correct batteries for your personal needs and how to hook them up at home. You will be shown how to choose the right power inverter and solar charge controller. And you will be given common household appliance energy consumption tables that will help you plan your own energy requirements. All of this will be shown in a simple to understand manner.</p>
<p>Some families may need to make a small adjustment to their daily power consumption in order to go off the grid on a budget, but I will cover these points as well. Also, how to set up energy saving devices in your home. And how to best hook up the solar energy for your particular needs.</p>
<p>You will be shown how to make a windmill from common parts that many of us already have in the home. With small changes to a standard AC motor, it can be converted into a windmill. With a little bit of work in the garage, anyone can make a windmill.</p>
<div class=""template""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.thediyworld.com/img/diy-box-fan-windmill.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>Shown above is the prototype of my first homemade box fan windmill, spinning in the wind and charging batteries. One of my homemade windmills is still on a roof and spinning in the wind today after three years.</p>
<h1>Water</h1>
<p>To be fully off the grid, you will need to have a fresh water supply and waste water disposal. How to set up an independent water supply, using rain water or ground water will be covered in depth. And how to make and use a composting toilet to convert solid waste safely into a useful, rich organic compost.</p>
<h1>Heat</h1>
<p>How to make a solar oven and a solar water distiller will be explained. These items do not need to be expensive, and the parts to make them yourself can be found easily.</p>
<p>I will show you how to make various types of passive solar heaters to heat your home and water supply for washing and bathing. I will cover the design and construction of a rocket stove to heat your home efficiently with very little wood consumption. You can also cook and heat water with your wood stove.</p>
<h1>Cooling</h1>
<p>How to use the earth to cool your home will be included as well. I will show you how to set up a geothermal cooling system to replace power hungry air conditioners.</p>
<h1>Food</h1>
<p>And, of course, an off grid home is not complete without an organic garden. I will take a rough, wild meadow and turn it into a garden that will provide enough food for the whole year. How to preserve your food will be the last phase of the project as the harvest is ready and the summer season comes to a close.</p>
<h1>The Project</h1>
<p>I have been preparing a 32 foot trailer in the woods for the project. I will be moving into the trailer and living there for the duration of the project. I will start out with only a small, homemade 65 watt solar panel for light and to keep my laptop going.</p>
<p>The project will begin in mid April and continue through the summer season. At the end of summer, early fall, the book and video will be produced.</p>
<p>Now, you might be asking yourself ""What makes him think he can pull this off?"" The answer is simple. I have been experimenting with electronics and natural living since I was very young. I am the owner of The DIY World (<a href=""http://www.thediyworld.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.thediyworld.com</a>) and have written many articles and books about natural energy and off grid living. And I will be living on the project site the whole time.</p>
<p>At the completion of all of the projects listed above, I will write a DIY book on how to get off the grid for $5,000 showing detailed explanations of every project. And for qualifying bidders, I will produce a documentary video showing every phase of the project. A support forum has already been set up to help you complete your own goal. I will be happy to assist you on the way to energy independence. </p>
<p>Note: for $5,000 you can go fully off the grid. You may choose to invest a little bit more, or less in some areas based on your own preferences and comfort level. You can also build up slowly, and expand, as time and money permit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have completed most of these projects in various forms in the past, but I want to lead you, every step of the way, and prove that you can get off the grid on a budget. That's why I am asking for the $5,000 - to prove it can be done, while demonstrating every aspect of it, live.

Luckily, our ClimateHero Park ( YuKon ) is perfectly located within the Aurora belt;  it is the a central point for further Arctic explorations.            
We discovered that if all travelers take flights to the Arctic, it will leave massive carbon footprint behind. Therefore, we created a self-guided road trip with our improved Solar Jeep Wranglers - starting from Vancouver to the Arctic with Four ClimateHero Parks. To help make everyone's journey more successful, the ClimateHero Park will provide two Jeep Wranglers in Vancouver. Two Jeeps that we spent time to turn them into environmental friendly vehicles that are capable to reduce carbon footprints along the journey.  The travelers will have peace of mind knowing that while they're making their journey to the Arctic, their carbon footprints will be offset. Thus, our travelers will not contribute nor have the guilt of melting the Arctic along with their trips.


 

 

For all $100 backers, everyone will become a registered co-owner of ClimateHero Park ( YuKon ) with a land title of a tiny property ( freehold ) - and therefore, the Arctic with the innovative shared economy model ! 
Not only that, all travelers will also get free camping – for life - in all Four ClimateHero Parks from Vancouver to the Arctic ANYTIME.
Now we invite you to join A marvelous 360° Arctic Adventure Journey with us from Vancouver to the Arcticon August 8 to 22, 2018.
Adore the northern lights with your own eyes, sleep and play in your ‘own’ park. 
We’ll ensure you will be impressed by the possibilities ClimateHero Park provides.
Our theme is ‘Make Different’ origin from Apple's ‘Think Different’ and Google's ‘Make Good Things Together’！

 



Through this crowdfunding campaign, we have another goal. Which is the recruitment of CEO and COO across the world for our project. we want to turn everyone's dream to reality.


Compensation: Great Salary + Solar Wrangler + 5 Acres Commercial Property (Freehold) in ClimateHero Park (+ Work Permit or Canadian Permanent Resident Card if applicable).

<p><b>art2water</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> is
a dream that we want to make a reality starting in 2014. The concept was originally to use proceeds from the sale of artistic paintings, mostly custom reproductions of masterpieces, to fund qualified clean water projects around the world. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">art2water held its first fundraiser with friends in Texas to see if it was an idea to which people would respond. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The first fundraiser was a </span><b>demonstrated success</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">. We raised </span><b>$3,000</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> through the sale of just 10 paintings. That initial success proved the concept and gave us the confidence that </span><b>art2water</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> can make a significant impact. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The </span><b>goal</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> is to raise the awareness of the water crisis. The </span><b>plan</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> is to provide clean water and sanitation capabilities in perilous places
such as Sudan, Cambodia, Uganda and Rwanda. </span></p><h3><br/></h3><h2>The Plan</h2><p>The plan is to provide quality, but affordable, art to people who understand and appreciate art and have a desire to help those less fortunate then themselves. By purchasing art from <b>art2water</b>, proceeds will be donated to qualified organizations that provide clean water and sanitation capabilities.  </p><p><b>art2water</b> has established relationships with a number of excellent reproduction artists worlwide. These artists have the skills and ability to create high quality artistic reproductions of you choosing, including:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Classic and Modern Masterpieces</span><br/>

</ul><p>By purchasing though <b>art2water</b>, not only are you helping those who desperately need clean water, you are also helping artists in the art2water network, most of whom are from emerging countries.</p>
<p><b style=""font-weight: normal;""><b>art2water</b></b> has assembled an initial team and this initial funding will be for a dedicated website, to establish a social media presence and to structure a plan to establish <b>art2water</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> as a self-sustaining organization. </span></p><h3><br/></h3><h2>Funding Requirements</h2><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">In order to launch </span><b>art2water</b>, <b>$5,000</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> is needed.

The purpose
of the art2water organization is to fund projects that provide clean water and sanitation capabilities to people in need around the world. Nearly 800 million people in the
world today lack access to adequate water and 2.5 billion people lack access to
improved sanitation. We are dedicated to overcoming this major problem. The idea is to give those whose lives have been privileged an opportunity to fight for those who can't fight for
themselves.Background
art2water is
a dream that we want to make a reality starting in 2014. The concept was originally to use proceeds from the sale of artistic paintings, mostly custom reproductions of masterpieces, to fund qualified clean water projects around the world. art2water held its first fundraiser with friends in Texas to see if it was an idea to which people would respond. The first fundraiser was a demonstrated success. We raised $3,000 through the sale of just 10 paintings. That initial success proved the concept and gave us the confidence that art2water can make a significant impact. 
The goal is to raise the awareness of the water crisis. The plan is to provide clean water and sanitation capabilities in perilous places
such as Sudan, Cambodia, Uganda and Rwanda. The PlanThe plan is to provide quality, but affordable, art to people who understand and appreciate art and have a desire to help those less fortunate then themselves. By purchasing art from art2water, proceeds will be donated to qualified organizations that provide clean water and sanitation capabilities.  art2water has established relationships with a number of excellent reproduction artists worlwide. These artists have the skills and ability to create high quality artistic reproductions of you choosing, including:

Classic and Modern Masterpieces

Travel Photography
Portraits
Landmarks
and much more
By purchasing though art2water, not only are you helping those who desperately need clean water, you are also helping artists in the art2water network, most of whom are from emerging countries.
art2water has assembled an initial team and this initial funding will be for a dedicated website, to establish a social media presence and to structure a plan to establish art2water as a self-sustaining organization. Funding RequirementsIn order to launch art2water, $5,000 is needed. The goal is to raise the necessary funds by January 31, 2014. Use of Proceeds

Develop and maintain the art2water website and storefront.

Create a social media presence. 
Purchase initial inventory of fine art reproductions.

Set-up infrastructure to ensure art2water becomes a self-sustaining organization. 

What You Get

For every donation of $250 or more, art2water will send you the book, Abstract Art  from the Taschen Basic Genre Series.


For every donation of $1000 or more, art2water will send
you the book, Abstract Art, from the Taschen Basic Genre Series. Further art2water will provide a 50% discount on one
unframed 18""x24"" reproduction painting of your choice.


YOUR Impact


By getting involved in this
     project, YOU make a difference and become part of this focused effort dedicated to providing clean water and sanitation capabilities in extreme areas. 

With YOUR initial donation you will directly reduce major diseases resulting from poisoned and infected water, and poor sanitization in extreme places around the world.

Profits derived from the sales of art reproductions will be converted in clean water. YOU will help
     save thousands of lives - most of them children. 


Other ways you can helpWe understand that not everyone can contribute at this time. However, you can still support the art2water mission. Please tell your friends, families and colleagues about art2water and ask if they can contribute. Thank youThank you for your help. Your contribution and support will directly help children around the world live a better, more healthful life. In many cases, you will be saving the lives of those who cannot help themselves.",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

The campaign for our English-speaking friends can be found here.

Unser Planet geht vor die Hunde. Nachweislich. Schneller als berechnet. Wir sind überzeugt: Wenn jeder Einzelne (s)einen Teil an Verantwortung und echten Taten übernimmt, wird selbst Unmögliches möglich. Dies Projekt ist unser Beitrag dazu.
_____________________________________________________________________________WAS WIR ANSTREBEN:

Möglichst vielen Menschen erlebbar zu machen, dass aktiver Umweltschutz kein Verlust  sondern sogar ein genussvoller Gewinn  ist. CO2 versenken statt zu produzieren, Aufzuforsten statt Abzuholzen, Böden beleben statt zu vergiften, Jobs zu schaffen statt zu zerstören.

Und, um Ihnen natürlich ein paar hübsche, biologisch abbaubare und unwiderstehliche(!) PERKS zugänglich zu machen. ;-)SCHLÜSSELELEMENTE: Nachhaltige Bambusplantage | biologischer Permakultur Anbau |  Wasserretentions Landschaft |  Waldgarten | biologischer Gemüsegarten | Vielfalt: alte Sorten, alte Arten | Mischfruchtanbau statt Monokultur | Natur-Ferienhäuser | ökologische Baumethoden: Lehmbau, Strohballenbau, Gründächer | per Lehmofen beheizt mit Bambus | netzunabhängig dank Wind- und Solarenergie | Abwassermanagement per biologischer Pflanzenkläranlage | Bio-Pools | Do-It-Yourself-Kurse: Shampoo, Waschmittel, Käse, Bogenbau, Lehmbau, Lehmöfen (uvm.) selbst gemacht | Fun Factor: Fotosafaris, Ausflüge zu Pferde, Fahrad, Quad, Wale, Delphine und Wildtiere beobachten, Schwimmen, Angeln, Bogenschießen und viel, viel viel mehr! :-) 

Wie die Anzahl der Kampagnen, ist auch jeder Projektschritt skalierbar und kann an die Unterstützung angepasst werden. Die Fertigstellung ist für Ende 2017 geplant. Projektschritte im Überblick:  Schritt 1: GrundstückSchritt 2: HauptgebäudeSchritt 3: ArbeitsplätzeSchritt 4: Gartenanlage & GerätschaftenSchritt 5: Stallungen & TiereSchritt 6: Gästehäuser & AusstattungSchritt 7: Freizeit & FunAuf dem Markt am Ostkap Südafrikas finden sich derzeit passende Grundstücke ab 5 ha (=50.000 qm). Zur Veranschaulichung der Proportionen ein kleiner Vergleich: - Baugrund 45km außerhalb Hamburgs, ländl. Lage, 1.996 qm: 259.000 EUR- Eigentumswohnung in Hamburg, 3 Zi., Wohnfläche 68,18 qm: 262.493 EUR

PROJEKTZIEL: Umdenken statt Resignation, Taten statt Endlosdiskussionen   

Es hilft nun nix: Unsere 
liebgewonnen Gewohnheiten hinsichtlich Hausbau, Anbau und Raubbau schädigen Klima, Umwelt und Gesundheit. Damit 
auch uns, unsere Gene, Beziehungen...  und damit unsere Kinder. Das lässt sich ändern. Nur tun hilft.Hier haben Sie die Chance etwas für's Klima zu tun. Auch für das in Ihrer eigenen Beziehung. Genießen Sie absolute Ruhe, inspirierende Freizeitaktivitäten und ein  Paar-Coaching auf einem Ökohof. Ein Urlaub, der für Sie maßgeschneidert wird.

Sie reisen gern? Dann ist es Zeit für einen Besuch in der Khangela! Eco Lodge. :-)

This is a true story of David and Goliath. Big Oil can spend millions on advertising and political contributions—but with your help, we can build a people-powered campaign strong enough to defeat them.</p><p><b>Why We Need Your Donation </b></p><p>Five months ago, an amazing group of volunteers came together to launch the Frack Free Butte County campaign. We’ve already had a big impact—even getting the County Board of Supervisors to vote in support of a ban. But if we’re going to defeat Big Oil, we urgently need a full-time organizer to take our campaign to the next level. <b>That’s where you come in</b>. With your donation, we can hire a full-time, seasoned organizer who can help us do everything we need to win, including: </p><ul>
<li><p>Organizing and expanding our existing pool of passionate volunteers</p></li>
<li><p>Training volunteers to run large door-to-door canvasses and phone banks to encourage thousands to turn out on Election Day</p></li>
<li><p>Creating eye-catching signs and advertisements to spread our message </p></li>
<li><p>Hosting events in our community to educate voters about the dangers of fracking and outline the steps they can take to fight back</p></li>
<li><p>Developing engaging advertisements that break through the expensive media strategy of the oil and gas industry </p></li>
<li><p>Engaging expert help to battle the legal attacks sure to be mounted by Big Oil and Gas before and after Election Day</p></li>
<li><p>Running a creative and sophisticated campaign to educate voters that Big Oil is threatening our air, water and way of life</p></li>
</ul><p><b>Why This Fight Matters</b></p><p>We’re fighting to ban fracking in Butte County because we don’t want to see our pristine water and rural way of life destroyed by a dangerous and toxic form of oil drilling. But this fight is much bigger than just our Sierra Nevada community and the consequences of fracking in our county go beyond our borders. If Butte County is fracked, our entire food supply—which feeds people across the nation—will be put in jeopardy. Furthermore, the Oroville Dam—which sits on a known fault—will be put at risk due to potential earthquakes that can be caused by fracking activities. This dam supplies water to 22-23 million people in California, so the risk of it breaking would be dire.</p>If we win this fight, Butte County will be the first county in California to ban fracking, which will serve as a model for other counties and send a powerful message to state policymakers that local communities are not going to let California get fracked. We know local bans can have a huge impact on state policy because they played a crucial role in stopping fracking in New York. And California is arguably the most important battleground right now in the fight against fracking nationwide.

<p>Respectful Revolution has featured Frack-Free
Butte County activist and spokesperson, Dave Garcia, in <a href=""http://www.respectfulrevolution.org/#/road/videos/ranger_dave_fracking_ban_butte_county"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this
video</a> where he explains our cause and his involvement. </p>
<p><span>It all started when retired Park Ranger, and active Sierra Club advocate, Dave Garcia, spoke up to his community about the hazards of fracking. He and Robyn DiFalco of the Butte Environmental Council brought Doug Shields, a city councilman from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to present on the dangers and risks of the new techniques used by oil and gas companies. The discussion ignited alarm and a group of attendees decided to act. They were concerned about what might happen if fracking came to Butte County and how it would endanger their water, air, agriculture, and way of life.</span></p><p>From that group, Butte County Citizens Action Network was formed and fighting fracking and other extreme energy techniques became its most urgent goal. So far, the all-volunteer team of the Frack-Free Butte County Campaign has collected over 2,000 signatures using both a preliminary petition addressed to the County Supervisors as well as an online petition on CREDO’s website. We have drafted a proposed ordinance with the help of Chico attorney Marty Dunlap and many others, and the petition is now circulating throughout our County.</p>We are a grassroots coalition of activists and advocates, concerned parents and grandparents, professionals, farmers, artists, professors, and students who have mobilized under one goal: to protect our air, water, and land for generations.

<p><b><i><br/></i></b></p><p><b><i>Fracking FAQs in Butte County and Beyond</i></b></p>
<p><b>1.) What is fracking? And what are the
other extreme unconventional extraction techniques that are used by oil and gas
companies?</b></p>
<p>Fracking—short for high-volume hydraulic
fracturing—is the unconventional extraction technique of forcing a mixture of
chemicals, sand, and vast quantities of water at extremely high pressure into a
bedrock formation to fracture rocks and release the oil and gas trapped within
them. To learn more about the process, visit <a href=""http://dangersoffracking.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this interactive website</a>.</p>
<p>While fracking has received a majority of
the media attention in California and throughout the nation when it comes to
oil and gas drilling, companies are experimenting with many newer
unconventional techniques to release reserves from California’s Monterey Shale.
These techniques include matrix acidization, acid fracking, steam and cyclic
injection, carbon dioxide flooding, dry fracking, and offshore fracking, and
each vary in how they access the contents of the shale.</p>
<p>For example, matrix acidization uses high
volumes of hydrofluoric acid and many other corrosive chemicals to break down
rocks underground, whereas steam and cyclic injection inject steam and chemical
additives into a well and left to soak to release the heavy crude.</p>
<p><b>2.) Why are these well-stimulation
techniques risky?</b></p>
<p>Fracking, along with wastewater injection
wells and other forms of unconventional well stimulation, can pollute the air
and water, increase the risk of earthquakes, and lead to severe health problems
such as cancer, birth defects, infertility and severe organ damage. It’s not a
matter of <i>if</i> our life will be impacted, but <i>when</i>.</p>
<p>The process of fracking is tremendously
water intensive and can have negative affects on our water supply, especially
in light of California’s drought. The amount of water used varies, with
estimates ranging between hundreds of thousands of gallons to nine million
gallons per well, and the water is contaminated with a host of dangerous
chemicals, oil and grease, high concentrations of salt, and in some cases small
concentrations of radioactive material. Since most of this contaminated water
cannot be recycled, it is removed from the water supply completely.</p>
<p>This wastewater is either disposed of in
evaporation ponds, which can release contaminates into the soil, water or air,
or in injection wells, which can cause earthquakes and contaminate local
surface and groundwater supplies. For more information, watch this <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/video/science/100000002590094/man-made-quakes.html?src=vidm"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>NY Times</i> video</a> or visit<a href=""http://www.shakyground.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">On Shaky Ground.</a></p>
<p>Furthermore, increased truck traffic
associated with fracking contributes to elevated ozone and particulate matter in
the air. In 2012, California oil wells required 12.2 million <a href=""http://www.watertrucks.com/faqs.asp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">truckloads</a> to transport<a href=""http://www.conservation.ca.gov/dog/Documents/2012%20Oil%20and%20Gas%20Production%20by%20County.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">2.7 billion
barrels of water</a> to
waste injection wells throughout the state. The combination of increased truck
emissions as well as the refining of additional crude oil can adversely affect
air quality—particularly in already stressed places in California such as Kern
County and the Los Angeles basin.</p>
<p>Much of the oil in California is extremely
carbon intensive and will drastically increase California’s carbon emissions.
According to the EPA, one barrel of oil releases 0.43 metric tons of CO2. If
the estimated 13.7 to 15.4 billion barrels of oil in the Monterey Shale is
extracted, about <a href=""http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/energy-resources/refs.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">5.89 billion
metric tons of CO2</a> would be released into the atmosphere. This would
greatly contribute to global climate change and would derail California’s AB 32
regulations—the ambitious climate goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by
25 percent by 2020.</p>
<p>Air and water contamination are damaging
not only to our environment, but to our bodies. Fracking uses hundreds of
chemicals, including endocrine disruptors, highly corrosive acids, and
carcinogens, which are known to cause <a href=""http://democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Hydraulic-Fracturing-Chemicals-2011-4-18.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">serious medical
problems</a> such as
infertility, birth defects, severe organ damage, and cancer. These health
impacts are even more acute the closer fracking is to urban populations. In Los
Angeles, well-stimulation activity is located in low-income communities with
high minority populations, already subject to other environmental health
stressors.</p>
<p>The substances required by these
techniques’ operations—silica sand, corrosive acid, and highly explosive crude
oil—pose risks to oil workers in addition to nearby residents. Silica sand can
become airborne and cause lung cancer, tuberculosis, and silicosis.
Hydrofluoric acid is one of the most dangerous chemicals in commercial use and
exposure to the substance can cause severe burns, organ damage, and death.
 </p>
<p>Employers working on fracking and
well-stimulation sites have a job fatality rate <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/programs/oilgas/risks.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">seven times
higher</a> than the
average worker. In addition, the number of rail shipments carrying oil to California
refineries has skyrocketed as has the number of proposed oil terminals and
rail-to-pipeline facilities in Richmond and Bakersfield, raising concerns among
state regulators of future oil spills and explosions.</p>
<p>All of these techniques present many
potential threats to our environment, economy, and public health and safety.
When you add all of these together, fracking and other well-stimulation methods
have the potential to impose more harm than good. The human price of oil has
become too high to risk the livelihoods of millions of people throughout the
state.</p>
<p><b>3.) Why is Butte County under threat? What
is happening now in Butte and in surrounding counties?</b></p>
<p>Butte County sits above a tight sandstone
formation, which is different from the shale formations where most of
California’s oil can be found, but which holds pockets of dry gas. Even though
there is gas instead of oil underneath the county, companies can use the same
well-stimulation techniques to access it. Currently, Occidental Petroleum has
purchased a majority of the 26 active wells in Butte and there is the
possibility they could reactivate the other approximately 260 wells throughout
the county—of which 90 percent are inactive. Since oil and gas companies were
not required to report the location and number of fracked wells prior to
January 2014, we do not know if any of these wells have already been fracked.
To see a map of the active gas wells in Butte County, <a href=""https://mapsengine.google.com/map/edit?mid=z-Rm2QrECgNY.k_dt3QUGbADo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">click here.</a></p>
<p>Four out of six counties surrounding Butte
County have already experienced fracking and other well-stimulation activities.
These four counties, in order of the magnitude of such activity, include
Colusa, Sutter, Glenn, and Tehama, and all are located along the Sacramento
River Valley.</p>
<p><b>4.) Why is it hard to find out if they
have already fracked in Butte County or what other techniques they are using?</b></p>
<p>Because information on fracking and other
well-stimulation techniques has been submitted voluntarily, no one knows for
sure if there is fracking in Butte County. On January 1, 2014, emergency
regulations under SB4 were put in place requiring oil and gas companies to
report the chemicals used for a frack job and the location of the fracked well.
While this is a good step forward, it still leaves room for secrecy. Oil and
gas companies are still not required to report the quantity of fracking fluid or
the ratio of dilution of any of the substances in the fluid. They also do not
have to report the use of well-stimulation techniques other than fracking, such
as acidizing or steam injection.</p>
<p><b>5.) What does Butte County stand to lose
if no action is taken against fracking?</b></p>
<p>Butte County is located in the Sacramento
Valley and rests against the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains.
Agriculture is the largest economic sector, and Butte County is home to many
farms that grow rice, vegetables, fruits and nuts. The county is also home to
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. and several smaller breweries and wineries. The Tuscan
aquifer provides water for these farms, businesses, and residents and is at
risk of being polluted by fracking and other well-stimulation techniques. Once
the water is polluted, there is no way to clean it up.</p>
<p>Fracking within Butte County could also
affect those outside of it. The city of Oroville sits right below Oroville Dam,
which supplies water to 22 to 23 million people in California. It also sits on
a known fault. Since wastewater injection increases the risk of earthquakes,
there is a possibility the dam could break, endangering millions of residents
downstream.  </p>
<p><b>7.) Is California being fracked now?</b></p>
<p>Yes, we know that fracking and other
unconventional well-stimulation techniques are being used in California, and
most of this activity is happening close to prime farmland in Kern County and
in dense urban areas in Los Angeles. However, since no regulations required oil
companies to report where they were fracking prior to January 1, 2014 (when
some emergency regulations were put in place), all of the information we have
was voluntarily supplied, so we don’t know how many wells are being
fracked. </p>
<p>The majority of unconventional oil and gas
reserves in California are locked within the Monterey Shale formation, which
stretches 2,520 square miles across Central and Southern California and rests
below the homes of 10 million Californians. According to estimates by the U.S.
Energy Information Association, 13.7 to 15.4 billion barrels of oil may lie underneath
this shale, and <a href=""http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/er/index.cfm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">27,584 wells</a>
would <span>be required to access all of
these reserves. Right now, oil companies are purchasing large tracts of mineral
and surface rights in anticipation of an oil and gas operations boom.</span></p>
<p><b>8.) What is the history of fracking in
California?</b></p>
<p>Fracking has been used for several decades
by the oil industry in California, but recent developments in drilling
technologies have increased the risks of the process. Traditionally, fracking
wells were drilled vertically, instead of horizontally, and did not require
large amounts of frack fluid or high pressure to extract oil and gas. Only in
the last decade have oil companies developed new extreme techniques, such as
horizontal drilling, acidizing, and steam injection in order to explore
previously unrecoverable oil reserves. But these oil reserves are much more
difficult to extract—especially in California, where the oil is thick and
viscous—and they require larger amounts of water and chemicals injected under
high pressure. Whereas a traditional fracked well might use about 750 gallons
of fluid, a modern high-volume hydraulically fracked well can use <a href=""https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/fossil-power/fracking-a-look-back"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">up to 8 million
gallons of fluid.</a> </p>
<p><b>9.) Is fracking in California regulated?</b></p>
<p>Fracking is mostly regulated by the
Department of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources, also known as DOGGR, but many
people are concerned about the agency’s close relationship to the oil and gas
industry and the department’s ability to accurately conduct thorough well
inspections. On January 1, 2014, SB4 was passed to regulate fracking in
California, and it requires DOGGR to track where and when fracking is
happening, what chemicals are being used, how much water is being used, and
where that water is coming from. SB4 also requires oil companies to test the
groundwater before and after operations and to notify surrounding residents
before well stimulation takes place. DOGGR has until January 1, 2015, to put
together more detailed regulations and finalize an independent scientific study
of well stimulation and its associated risks.</p>
<p>But SB4 doesn’t prevent fracking from
happening and doesn’t regulate acidizing and new, unconventional oil extraction
techniques that are currently in use in California. Another bill, SB1132, has
been proposed this year by Senators Holly Mitchell and Mark Leno to achieve a
state-wide moratorium on fracking and other well-stimulation techniques.</p>
<p><b>10.) What are oil and gas companies doing
now? What are we up against?</b></p>
<p>The main oil and gas companies currently
operating in California include: Occidental Petroleum, Venoco, Aera Energy,
Freeport MacMoRan Oil &amp; Gas, Chevron, and Santa Maria Energy. These
companies have been aggressively acquiring mineral and surface rights and/or
leases throughout the state, particularly the property above the Monterey
Shale, and they have a vested interest in continuing their production without
the setback of public health safeguards, stricter regulations, or higher taxes.
Over the past five years, the oil and gas industry, including the Western
States Petroleum Association, Chevron, BP, and other companies, spent a
combined total of <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/04/01/1288884/-Oil-lobby-spent-56-63-million-in-Sacramento-over-past-five-years"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">$56.63 million</a>
lobbying the California State Capital. This is enough money to buy every single
Californian household a $4 gallon of gas.</p>

Big Oil can spend millions on advertising and political contributions—but with your help, we can build a people-powered campaign strong enough to defeat them.Why We Need Your Donation Five months ago, an amazing group of volunteers came together to launch the Frack Free Butte County campaign. We’ve already had a big impact—even getting the County Board of Supervisors to vote in support of a ban. But if we’re going to defeat Big Oil, we urgently need a full-time organizer to take our campaign to the next level. That’s where you come in. With your donation, we can hire a full-time, seasoned organizer who can help us do everything we need to win, including: 
Organizing and expanding our existing pool of passionate volunteers
Training volunteers to run large door-to-door canvasses and phone banks to encourage thousands to turn out on Election Day
Creating eye-catching signs and advertisements to spread our message 
Hosting events in our community to educate voters about the dangers of fracking and outline the steps they can take to fight back
Developing engaging advertisements that break through the expensive media strategy of the oil and gas industry 
Engaging expert help to battle the legal attacks sure to be mounted by Big Oil and Gas before and after Election Day
Running a creative and sophisticated campaign to educate voters that Big Oil is threatening our air, water and way of life
Why This Fight MattersWe’re fighting to ban fracking in Butte County because we don’t want to see our pristine water and rural way of life destroyed by a dangerous and toxic form of oil drilling. But this fight is much bigger than just our Sierra Nevada community and the consequences of fracking in our county go beyond our borders. If Butte County is fracked, our entire food supply—which feeds people across the nation—will be put in jeopardy. Furthermore, the Oroville Dam—which sits on a known fault—will be put at risk due to potential earthquakes that can be caused by fracking activities. This dam supplies water to 22-23 million people in California, so the risk of it breaking would be dire.If we win this fight, Butte County will be the first county in California to ban fracking, which will serve as a model for other counties and send a powerful message to state policymakers that local communities are not going to let California get fracked. We know local bans can have a huge impact on state policy because they played a crucial role in stopping fracking in New York. And California is arguably the most important battleground right now in the fight against fracking nationwide. So whether or not you live in Butte County, or even in California, please click one of the donation levels on the right and become a partner in our campaign!  The Back Story
Respectful Revolution has featured Frack-Free
Butte County activist and spokesperson, Dave Garcia, in this
video where he explains our cause and his involvement. 
It all started when retired Park Ranger, and active Sierra Club advocate, Dave Garcia, spoke up to his community about the hazards of fracking. He and Robyn DiFalco of the Butte Environmental Council brought Doug Shields, a city councilman from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to present on the dangers and risks of the new techniques used by oil and gas companies. The discussion ignited alarm and a group of attendees decided to act. They were concerned about what might happen if fracking came to Butte County and how it would endanger their water, air, agriculture, and way of life.From that group, Butte County Citizens Action Network was formed and fighting fracking and other extreme energy techniques became its most urgent goal. So far, the all-volunteer team of the Frack-Free Butte County Campaign has collected over 2,000 signatures using both a preliminary petition addressed to the County Supervisors as well as an online petition on CREDO’s website. We have drafted a proposed ordinance with the help of Chico attorney Marty Dunlap and many others, and the petition is now circulating throughout our County.We are a grassroots coalition of activists and advocates, concerned parents and grandparents, professionals, farmers, artists, professors, and students who have mobilized under one goal: to protect our air, water, and land for generations.

Fracking FAQs in Butte County and Beyond
1.) What is fracking? And what are the
other extreme unconventional extraction techniques that are used by oil and gas
companies?
Fracking—short for high-volume hydraulic
fracturing—is the unconventional extraction technique of forcing a mixture of
chemicals, sand, and vast quantities of water at extremely high pressure into a
bedrock formation to fracture rocks and release the oil and gas trapped within
them. To learn more about the process, visit this interactive website.
While fracking has received a majority of
the media attention in California and throughout the nation when it comes to
oil and gas drilling, companies are experimenting with many newer
unconventional techniques to release reserves from California’s Monterey Shale.
These techniques include matrix acidization, acid fracking, steam and cyclic
injection, carbon dioxide flooding, dry fracking, and offshore fracking, and
each vary in how they access the contents of the shale.
For example, matrix acidization uses high
volumes of hydrofluoric acid and many other corrosive chemicals to break down
rocks underground, whereas steam and cyclic injection inject steam and chemical
additives into a well and left to soak to release the heavy crude.
2.) Why are these well-stimulation
techniques risky?
Fracking, along with wastewater injection
wells and other forms of unconventional well stimulation, can pollute the air
and water, increase the risk of earthquakes, and lead to severe health problems
such as cancer, birth defects, infertility and severe organ damage. It’s not a
matter of if our life will be impacted, but when.
The process of fracking is tremendously
water intensive and can have negative affects on our water supply, especially
in light of California’s drought. The amount of water used varies, with
estimates ranging between hundreds of thousands of gallons to nine million
gallons per well, and the water is contaminated with a host of dangerous
chemicals, oil and grease, high concentrations of salt, and in some cases small
concentrations of radioactive material. Since most of this contaminated water
cannot be recycled, it is removed from the water supply completely.
This wastewater is either disposed of in
evaporation ponds, which can release contaminates into the soil, water or air,
or in injection wells, which can cause earthquakes and contaminate local
surface and groundwater supplies. For more information, watch this NY Times video or visitOn Shaky Ground.
Furthermore, increased truck traffic
associated with fracking contributes to elevated ozone and particulate matter in
the air. In 2012, California oil wells required 12.2 million truckloads to transport2.7 billion
barrels of water to
waste injection wells throughout the state. The combination of increased truck
emissions as well as the refining of additional crude oil can adversely affect
air quality—particularly in already stressed places in California such as Kern
County and the Los Angeles basin.
Much of the oil in California is extremely
carbon intensive and will drastically increase California’s carbon emissions.
According to the EPA, one barrel of oil releases 0.43 metric tons of CO2. If
the estimated 13.7 to 15.4 billion barrels of oil in the Monterey Shale is
extracted, about 5.89 billion
metric tons of CO2 would be released into the atmosphere. This would
greatly contribute to global climate change and would derail California’s AB 32
regulations—the ambitious climate goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by
25 percent by 2020.
Air and water contamination are damaging
not only to our environment, but to our bodies. Fracking uses hundreds of
chemicals, including endocrine disruptors, highly corrosive acids, and
carcinogens, which are known to cause serious medical
problems such as
infertility, birth defects, severe organ damage, and cancer. These health
impacts are even more acute the closer fracking is to urban populations. In Los
Angeles, well-stimulation activity is located in low-income communities with
high minority populations, already subject to other environmental health
stressors.
The substances required by these
techniques’ operations—silica sand, corrosive acid, and highly explosive crude
oil—pose risks to oil workers in addition to nearby residents. Silica sand can
become airborne and cause lung cancer, tuberculosis, and silicosis.
Hydrofluoric acid is one of the most dangerous chemicals in commercial use and
exposure to the substance can cause severe burns, organ damage, and death.
 
Employers working on fracking and
well-stimulation sites have a job fatality rate seven times
higher than the
average worker. In addition, the number of rail shipments carrying oil to California
refineries has skyrocketed as has the number of proposed oil terminals and
rail-to-pipeline facilities in Richmond and Bakersfield, raising concerns among
state regulators of future oil spills and explosions.
All of these techniques present many
potential threats to our environment, economy, and public health and safety.
When you add all of these together, fracking and other well-stimulation methods
have the potential to impose more harm than good. The human price of oil has
become too high to risk the livelihoods of millions of people throughout the
state.
3.) Why is Butte County under threat? What
is happening now in Butte and in surrounding counties?
Butte County sits above a tight sandstone
formation, which is different from the shale formations where most of
California’s oil can be found, but which holds pockets of dry gas. Even though
there is gas instead of oil underneath the county, companies can use the same
well-stimulation techniques to access it. Currently, Occidental Petroleum has
purchased a majority of the 26 active wells in Butte and there is the
possibility they could reactivate the other approximately 260 wells throughout
the county—of which 90 percent are inactive. Since oil and gas companies were
not required to report the location and number of fracked wells prior to
January 2014, we do not know if any of these wells have already been fracked.
To see a map of the active gas wells in Butte County, click here.
Four out of six counties surrounding Butte
County have already experienced fracking and other well-stimulation activities.
These four counties, in order of the magnitude of such activity, include
Colusa, Sutter, Glenn, and Tehama, and all are located along the Sacramento
River Valley.
4.) Why is it hard to find out if they
have already fracked in Butte County or what other techniques they are using?
Because information on fracking and other
well-stimulation techniques has been submitted voluntarily, no one knows for
sure if there is fracking in Butte County. On January 1, 2014, emergency
regulations under SB4 were put in place requiring oil and gas companies to
report the chemicals used for a frack job and the location of the fracked well.
While this is a good step forward, it still leaves room for secrecy. Oil and
gas companies are still not required to report the quantity of fracking fluid or
the ratio of dilution of any of the substances in the fluid. They also do not
have to report the use of well-stimulation techniques other than fracking, such
as acidizing or steam injection.
5.) What does Butte County stand to lose
if no action is taken against fracking?
Butte County is located in the Sacramento
Valley and rests against the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains.
Agriculture is the largest economic sector, and Butte County is home to many
farms that grow rice, vegetables, fruits and nuts. The county is also home to
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. and several smaller breweries and wineries. The Tuscan
aquifer provides water for these farms, businesses, and residents and is at
risk of being polluted by fracking and other well-stimulation techniques. Once
the water is polluted, there is no way to clean it up.
Fracking within Butte County could also
affect those outside of it. The city of Oroville sits right below Oroville Dam,
which supplies water to 22 to 23 million people in California. It also sits on
a known fault. Since wastewater injection increases the risk of earthquakes,
there is a possibility the dam could break, endangering millions of residents
downstream.  
7.) Is California being fracked now?
Yes, we know that fracking and other
unconventional well-stimulation techniques are being used in California, and
most of this activity is happening close to prime farmland in Kern County and
in dense urban areas in Los Angeles. However, since no regulations required oil
companies to report where they were fracking prior to January 1, 2014 (when
some emergency regulations were put in place), all of the information we have
was voluntarily supplied, so we don’t know how many wells are being
fracked. 
The majority of unconventional oil and gas
reserves in California are locked within the Monterey Shale formation, which
stretches 2,520 square miles across Central and Southern California and rests
below the homes of 10 million Californians. According to estimates by the U.S.
Energy Information Association, 13.7 to 15.4 billion barrels of oil may lie underneath
this shale, and 27,584 wells
would be required to access all of
these reserves. Right now, oil companies are purchasing large tracts of mineral
and surface rights in anticipation of an oil and gas operations boom.
8.) What is the history of fracking in
California?
Fracking has been used for several decades
by the oil industry in California, but recent developments in drilling
technologies have increased the risks of the process. Traditionally, fracking
wells were drilled vertically, instead of horizontally, and did not require
large amounts of frack fluid or high pressure to extract oil and gas. Only in
the last decade have oil companies developed new extreme techniques, such as
horizontal drilling, acidizing, and steam injection in order to explore
previously unrecoverable oil reserves. But these oil reserves are much more
difficult to extract—especially in California, where the oil is thick and
viscous—and they require larger amounts of water and chemicals injected under
high pressure. Whereas a traditional fracked well might use about 750 gallons
of fluid, a modern high-volume hydraulically fracked well can use up to 8 million
gallons of fluid. 
9.) Is fracking in California regulated?
Fracking is mostly regulated by the
Department of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources, also known as DOGGR, but many
people are concerned about the agency’s close relationship to the oil and gas
industry and the department’s ability to accurately conduct thorough well
inspections. On January 1, 2014, SB4 was passed to regulate fracking in
California, and it requires DOGGR to track where and when fracking is
happening, what chemicals are being used, how much water is being used, and
where that water is coming from. SB4 also requires oil companies to test the
groundwater before and after operations and to notify surrounding residents
before well stimulation takes place. DOGGR has until January 1, 2015, to put
together more detailed regulations and finalize an independent scientific study
of well stimulation and its associated risks.
But SB4 doesn’t prevent fracking from
happening and doesn’t regulate acidizing and new, unconventional oil extraction
techniques that are currently in use in California. Another bill, SB1132, has
been proposed this year by Senators Holly Mitchell and Mark Leno to achieve a
state-wide moratorium on fracking and other well-stimulation techniques.
10.) What are oil and gas companies doing
now? What are we up against?
The main oil and gas companies currently
operating in California include: Occidental Petroleum, Venoco, Aera Energy,
Freeport MacMoRan Oil & Gas, Chevron, and Santa Maria Energy. These
companies have been aggressively acquiring mineral and surface rights and/or
leases throughout the state, particularly the property above the Monterey
Shale, and they have a vested interest in continuing their production without
the setback of public health safeguards, stricter regulations, or higher taxes.
Over the past five years, the oil and gas industry, including the Western
States Petroleum Association, Chevron, BP, and other companies, spent a
combined total of $56.63 million
lobbying the California State Capital. This is enough money to buy every single
Californian household a $4 gallon of gas.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div>","The Need

Life for Tizade (this campaign is still active)
You can still donate and claim perks.. we are doing ongoing work.  Although this particular dam is almost complete and inaurguration will happen on April 14th.   We will post more pics then of the dam and our ongoing projects.Suicide is a part of village life in Tizade, Maharastra India.In the past five years 35 farmers, young and old have swallowed the pesticide designed for their fields - a devastating loss for this small village of only 317 dwellings.
Life in rural India can be incredibly hard. In rainy season it pours, floods come - roofs leak, all turns to mud and the water rushes away carrying precious topsoil with it.  In only a few short months the heat returns and rapidly dries the land to dust.

The women toil often for hours carrying heavy 'dabbas' (water containers) on their heads. 


Kitchen gardens shrivel, well levels drop an streams cease to flow. 


The village cattle give little milk as they have to walk far for water.


The meagre 1 - 2 acre farms only produce one crop a year and the only continual growth is the debt at the banks and money lenders.  Desperation sets in and alcohol provides a temporary escape. Death is more permanent!


The other issues which arising from the hardship are:


With no money for labour children are needed to help on the farms and education falls by the wayside. 


Water borne diseases increase as the levels of water in the wells drop


Families disintegrate as people leave for work in the cities and these migrants take their place with countless homeless on the streets, their children forced to beg for food.


Mothers will not allow their daughters to marry the young men of Tizade because the risk of widowhood is too great.


Alcoholism increases with the pain of no hope of a better life.



Where in all this darkness is the Solution?


We have the potential to make a difference to these issues.
The difference lies in the simple ability to access water throughout the year.
This will bring life and more importantly, joy, back to Tizade.
For those of you who see the potential for change as a result of bringing reliable water supply to the people please support us here - choose your reward and click the link. 
With your help we are building small check dams, traditional methods that in the rush of modern life and the over population of the area - have been left by the wayside.
Check dams encourage the fast monsoonal flow of the streams to slow and dam so that the water has time to soak into the storage below - recharging the aquifers - creating an underground storage of the water supply - the perfect place for this precious nectar of life.
Wells for up to 2 kms from the check dam are seen to maintain a water supply all year round when previously they would dry up. Very often the springs will regenerate and the streams become perennial.
With village and farmer collaboration this work succeeds.
It is clear that with an abundance of water the whole face of the village life changes.

   
Will you help us?Do you believe that everyone deserves something as simple and crucial for life as clean, safe water? We most certainly do.  Will you help us give people this basic human right?We know it works and here is just one story of many that with your help we will recreate:In a village near Tizade, where a water harvesting program has been in place for some years, we met the head man.       His story was both painful and inspiring. Some years ago he borrowed 70,000 rupiah. (approx USD1,200) from a money lender.  For this meagre amount his only recourse for repayment were to place his three children between the ages of 10 and 13 with that lender for a period of 7 years.  They were no more than slaves. Since water harvesting began in his village his family is now reunited - he is out of debt, has become the head man of the village council and is living a relatively prosperous lifestyle.We will replicate this work.Our friends at The Dilasa Foundation have done some 600 water harvesting structures and through that work have helped more than 60,000 households.   They are ready and willing to advise us in our work.   Mentors who have done the work before us that we are able to model are of great value.We know it works.A better future is available for poor farmers - in just one year.It only took one good rain to fill this dam below.Meet Chanda Mukind MoonHers is one of the many faces of the village.  Together we will help to bring joy back into the hearts and minds of those who live here.Chanda and her family are excited for the renewed possibilities that water will bring.She knows that clean abundant water will change absolutely everything. Kitchen gardens flourish, the farmers can irrigate and grow more than one crop a year. With abundant underground water the effects of a time of drought are not so great.Bank loans can be repaid - communities built - wives can be found and the exodus from the village brought to a halt.What do we need and how can you help? 
We need funding.  You can help with a little or a lot!!See our list of rewards that we have that will help us to bring Life to Tizade.You can even join us in the village for a journey experience like no other.  And please - share - share - share - our campaign as widely as possible with all your connections. At the village level together we can make change.Our job:Along with fund raising, is the organisation, planning, purchase of the cement and other supplies, as well as creating a celebration for the villagers while the dam building is happening.The villagers job:Will help build it. Bring the stone and other materials so they have a strong sense of ownership. They will create also a maintenance fund so the dam can have a long life and bring water for years.Your job:Help us with the funding. Whatever you can give will be of great help to us. Together we can bring life and community back into the village.

<h3>Water, our greatest commodity</h3>
<p>Water is a growing commodity on a world scale, and investors are starting to line up with large global projects. But rapid industrialization, increasing agricultural use, and climate change have contributed to worldwide water shortages. From a WHO report in 2015, 1 in 10 people lack access to safe water. We want to be part of the solution by supplying water-from-air machines for households and small businesses, directly from the sun, with no water supply or power supply.</p>

<h3>The Story of the Agua Machine</h3>
<p>I was flying back on a long business trip from Asia to the US and I began to think about an innovative product: water from the air like a dehumidifier but clean to drink, able to function off-grid so solar powered is required, and lastly, an IOT device to be able to monitor and control all functions.</p>
<p>As I started looking into the product, I saw that there was already an industry that makes Atmospheric Water Generators, but I was surprised to see that all products are AC powered, hence not practical for solar use. Also an AC powered compressor (the main power hog in this system) is inefficient compared to DC power, and all the efficiency is needed when solar powered.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471293701/hkivusplnxlcdzrirwcn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Agua Machine was born</strong>, and the design of the prototype unit had begun. Below are the main features of the Agua Machine:</p>
<ul>
<li>Direct Solar Powered</li>
<li>40L of water per day (with 70ºF and 60% humidity)</li>
<li>Innovative high efficiency design</li>
<li>All systems designed for uniqueness of solar power</li>

<p><i>3D drawing of the Agua Machine prototype</i></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>But can we do it?</h3>
<p>This type of product requires specialist electrical engineering technology (power switching and software), and specialist mechanical engineering technology (innovative dehumidifier design). I (Keith) am a professional electrical engineer with many years experience working with the type of motors and electronics needed for the Agua Machine. But when I started, I was definitely lacking in the knowledge of the dehumidifier and filter design. Luckily I was able to connect with Roland Wahlgren of Atmoswater Research, an expert in atmospheric water generators. Also an on board microncontroller controls all the power switching function, all the sensors, as well as the IOT function. This will only work with the expertise of our software engineer, Robert Meade. And lastly, our storyteller, the man behind the video is My Friend Dan, Dan Freund. Together we have come up an innovative design pushing the limits of water-from-air technology and solar generated DC power, all connected.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>In a nutshell, water is contained in the air in its gaseous form (there is more water in warm humid air). The Agua Machine cools the air to just below the air's dew point, the water condensers in the evaporator and is then collected and filtered to remove any microbials to produce clean drinking water, water from air.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Who would use the Agua Machine?</h3>
<p>As an atmospheric water generator, the optimal condition is a warm and humid climate; with these conditions, the most water will be produced. As the projected capacity of the Agua Machine is 40 liters per day, then the Agua Machine can be used most in off grid areas with unreliable water supplies; families in developing countries that rely on bottled water, or small businesses that cannot rely on the local water supply. With the Agua machine, it is a reliable, self sufficient source of clean water.</p>

<h3><strong>Why we need the campaign?</strong></h3>
<p>The design of the Agua Machine prototype is complete; the electrical PCB (which is the controller for the whole unit) has been made and the parts have been added.</p>
<p>But the cost of the full prototype of the Agua Machine with everything fully functioning, is about $3000<i>.</i> And that is <strong>not</strong> including the solar panels. Hence to even build a few prototypes to optimize the design, and fully test the product at location before moving to production becomes quite costly.</p>
<p><strong>So please help us raise funds to build at least three prototypes</strong>. These prototypes will be sent to people around the world, in need of self sufficient clean water.

Agua Machine prototype, with the solar panels,$4500Give for a full prototype and solar panels for the full off grid experience. With this perk, you would receive a fully functioning Agua Machine yourself with the solar panels, wherever you live, shipped to you; turn it on, and receive self sufficient clean water right there for you. Or maybe better, donate a full prototype with the panels to a family that needs clean water.
Thank you very much for your time, and I hope you can support us on this important project!",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>ThermoProtect
is a rapidly growing company.<span>  We have
ten sales agents backed up by a strong call centre, core directors and finance
&amp; administration team.  To date, the
directors have self financed the launch of ThermoProtect in the period since
launch and that has seen a £75000 sponsorship to be the main sponsor at the
Ideal Home Show.  Following the Ideal
Home Show and the exposure that we anticipate we will receive as a result of
our 18 days attendance as the main sponsor, it is our intention to create “Renewable
Energy Education Popups” across major towns and cities throughout the UK.  We feel that the UK consumer needs the
ability to be able to discuss their questions with specialist advisors prior to
committing to a capital purchase investment of a product designed to save money
whilst reducing their carbon footprint and we feel that popup education centres
will be a fantastic way to promote ThermoProtect whilst helping the UK consumer
to better understand why switching to a Renewable Energy product is a wise
move.</span></p>
<p>In order
for our company to grow and maximise its exposure at the Ideal Home Show and
thereafter, we want to fund to purchase of miniature eco style homes that can
be transported to locations to hold residencies in high traffic areas where
potential customers can pop in for a coffee and find out more about
ThermoProtect and how it aims to be the UK’s number one drop in centre for
Renewable Energy.<span>  In summary:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>We are
looking for £50000 which will purchase 3 miniature eco style homes and pay for
the fitting of our product displays.<span>  The
cost of the eco homes are £10000 per unit and we believe that another £20000
headroom with give us the ability to completely finance the set up of our pop
up show rooms including licences and transportation.  The business on a day to day basis currently
generates a small profit within its first 3 months of trading and with a high
overhead base, this is a phenomenal achievement.</span></p></li>
<li><p>We
anticipate that out of 160,000 people who pass through our eco-home at the
Ideal Home Show, we will collect a minimum of 10% data which totals 16,000
leads.<span>  Out of those leads, we anticipate
arranging home sit appointments for 10% of those leads totalling 1,600 people
at a close rate of 1 in 3.  This will
generate ThermoProtect in excess of £650,000 profit and will create a huge
launch pad from which our business will continue to thrive.  We are at the very start of a journey that
will see our products become necessities over the next 5 years, particularly as
building regulations continue to change to favour renewable energy as well as
the commericial market seeing huge changes in legislation for energy in 2018.</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>We are offering our Crowdfunding investors with
hige savings if they chose to have a home installation of Lapolla Spray
Insulation, Lailey &amp; Coates Air Source Heat Pumps or Tesla PowerWall
Battery Storage Solutions!</p>
<ul>
<li>If we do not reach our
     funding goal, we shall continue to use any invested funds to purchase at
     least one eco show unit from which we can proceed with our plan to create educational
     pop up show rooms.<span>  Taunton Town
     Council have stated that they want to focus on becoming a major Eco-Town
     within the UK and we feel that such bold statements provide us with huge
     traction to build a significant share of the market for the generation and
     harvesting of renewable energy.  Any
     raised funds will primarily purchase eco units at a cost price which hold
     a greater retail value, therefore, we are creating an asset base rather
     than a cash burn scenario.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>For those
who invest in our project, you will be helping with the growth and expansion of
a company who actually care about the Carbon Footprint of the world and have
built a product base that put profits as a secondary benefit to achieving real
carbon reducing results for the home owner.<span> 
Our products save people money, add value to properties and genuinely
have a significant benefit to the lifestyle of those who purchase from us.  Selling our products is important, however,
we feel that the promotion of renewable technologies to a wide audience in an
educational style where we can spend the time helping the consumer to make
informed decisions.  We are a company
with ethics who have established an Ethical Trading Point where our sales
margin is not to the detriment of mass market affordability of our
products.  We do not wish for our
products to be available to those with excess funds, we want everyday working
class people to be able to afford to purchase our products and reap the reward
of improved energy efficiency at significantly reduced costs whilst doing their
bit to reduce the global carbon footprint.</span></p>
<p>We have a
variety of case studies from our existing installations where our customers are
seeing increased comfort within their properties, solutions to damp issues,
reduction in energy costs and general strengthening of their property.<span>  We are proud to have built a range of
products that wholly compliment each other and work efficiently together and we
are riding the crest of a wave in a market that is yet to build momentum in the
UK.</span></p>
<p>ThermoProtect
is all about trust.<span>  We have a 14 day
cooling off period for customers, we do not believe in pressure selling to
close a deal on the day, instead, we focus on making our products as easy to
understand as possible so that our customers can spend the time making some
informed decisions before parting with their money.  We feel that this method of sales creates a
longevity for our business and builds an inherent value whereby ThermoProtect
will become the “go to” company for Renewable Energy Products.  There has been a huge amount of negative
press within the renewable sector where government incentives such as Feed In
and Renewable Heat Incentive have been used as a bargaining tool to inflate
product prices with passing on the real saving incentive to the consumer.  This is where we differ, we believe that if
Feed In and RHI are available, the customer should benefit in addition to the
fantastic value of our products and the cost savings they can generate.  Fundamentally, we steer clear of greed whilst
building a reputation that creates value, trust and satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>Our
business was built by people who are passionate about reducing the carbon
footprint of the UK consumer – we genuinely care.<span>  The renewable sector is a busy market place
which sees companies come and go due to rapid growth and decline that follow
the trends of the level of government incentive behind the product.  Our products require an investment from the consumer,
they aren’t free and on the whole, do not come with grants or incentives other
than the fact they do exactly what they say on the tin.  We believe that our market place and
competitor profile is reasonably buoyant and despite the fact we have other
people doing what we do, the feedback from our existing customer base is
exemplary.  Our company is attractive to
work for, it pays its employees fairly, it gains trust and respect from those
employees who enjoy managing our customer expectations in a brutally upfront
and honest way.  There are many companies
who take the approach of “sell at all costs” or “buy low and sell high”, we
take the approach to buy low, sell fairly and sell to those who want our
products and will benefit from having our products.  It is this approach that sets us apart from
our competitors and as our company profile proliferates with word of mouth to
become the “trusted” renewable energy brand, we feel that our business will
grow exponentially.</span></p>
<p>Since our
launch, we have had to make some tough decisions.<span>  We have had sales agents who didn’t fit in
with our ethics, we have had to build serious relationships of trust and honour
with our suppliers whose brands we represent and most importantly, we have had
to learn how to build a rapport with our customers so that we are at the
forefront of their thoughts as and when the venture into the renewable energy marketplace.  The rapid decrease in price of oil and gas
hasn’t helped the renewable energy market to grow as quickly as perhaps it
should have done and this is a challenge we face, particularly because cost is
not everything whereas doing our bit to safeguard the global environment for
our children, grand children and many more generations to come, remains our
challenge and the legacy from which we will be known.</span></p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>You may
not be interested to invest in our company at this present stage of time,
however, if you believe in what we do, we welcome word of mouth recommendations.<span>  If you choose not to invest but you have an
interest in our company and our products, please feel free to contact us to
discuss your requirements.  </span></p>
<p>If you
choose to invest in us, you will be helping us to build a national brand over
the next 5 years of which we can all be proud of.<span>  Our core values and ethics are important to
us and we believe in a better future for energy consumers where homes and
properties can become self sustainable, using off-grid technology at a fraction
of the cost.</span></p>

<p>THE JIMMY OCEAN PROJECT - OCEAN POLLUTION-THE FUNKY SOLUTION</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi, I'm David Raine, My connections with the sea run deep, I’ve owned ocean-going square riggers, sailed dhows, Viking longboats and even dugout canoes,I’ve stroked a sperm whale, talked to dolphins and hugged a shark, made films in the East Greenland ice, the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean and the Norwegian Artic.</p>
<p>And now I have a new challenge. <strong>NO PLASTIC FISH ON MY GRAND DAUGHTERS DINNER PLATE. <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>IF WE ARE ABLE TO INSPIRE JUST ONE YOUNG PERSON TO DISCOVER THE COMPLETE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF PLASTIC OCEAN POLLUTION - POSSIBLY THROUGH A SCIENTIFIC BREAK-THROUGH OF A NEW RANGE OF PLASTICS THAT BIO-DEGRADE INTO FISH FOOD, THEN WHAT A SUCCESS THIS PROJECT WOULD HAVE BEEN.  YOU CAN MAKE THAT DREAM A REALITY. </strong></p>
<p><strong>IT TAKES ONLY A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY FROM MANY PEOPLE. BE ONE OF THOSE.<br/></strong></p>
<p>During my lifetime the oceans have become increasingly polluted with discarded plastic and I want to do something about that. I need your help to do it.</p>
<p>Together with my expert team, are running a campaign to raise awareness of plastic pollution in our oceans. The campaign is called The Jimmy Ocean Project and it involves making lamps from rubbish bits of plastic collected on the beach. We want children worldwide to think about how plastic is used and discarded in the future – <strong>microscopic plastic is being found by scientists in fish</strong>; that is just appalling.

<p><strong>NO PLASTIC FISH ON MY GRAND DAUGHTERS DINNER PLATE.</strong></p>
<h3>The aim of the Jimmy/Bibi Ocean Project is to raise awareness of the rapidly increasing plastic pollution in our oceans and to do it in a funky innovative way that gets attention.</h3>
<p>The solar powered lamps will be made from collected beach plastic, either collected by you or by us. If you collect plastic beach polluting bits, mail them to us, then that Jimmy or Bibi lamp will uniquely yours.</p>
<p>The lamps are intended to remind everyone that our oceans are precious and that they should not be polluted with discarded plastic.</p>
<h3><strong>Plastic does not biodegrade it photo degrades into smaller and smaller pieces that last forever.</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Initially we will make two solar powered lamp models - Jimmy Ocean and Bibi Ocean, 35cm high – price including delivery worldwide will be $90. As we grow our beach plastic lamp range will increase, also there will be special editions.</p>
<p><strong>It’s a question of getting the message out.</strong></p>
<p>WE NEED TO MAKE THIS PROJECT HUGE – GLOBALLY HUGE - TO MATCH THE PROBLEM.</p>
<p><strong>The more money that we get then the quicker we can spread the word that our fish are eating plastic – just think about that…..that’s horrible! <br/></strong></p>

<p><strong>THE SERIOUS STUFF</strong>! <em> </em><em>The core of the problem</em>.</p>
<p>Our oceans are becoming seriously polluted with discarded plastic, billions of pieces that last forever photo-degrading into microscopic pieces that are entering the marine food chain.</p>
<p>In the North Pacific Ocean a floating island of plastic has formed by the gyration of ocean currents which is twice the size of Texas. Floating plastic islands are forming the same way in all oceans.</p>
<p>Granulated plastic is forming beaches on Pacific islands.</p>
<p>Discarded plastic is even reaching the Arctic and the Antarctic – areas that previously were synonymous the idea of pristine nature.</p>
<p>When I collected driftwood as a boy plastic pollution barely existed and now it is the scourge of our beaches and of our seas.</p>
<p>It’s intended that the Jimmy and Bibi lamps will be our ambassadors for behavioural change, but also, and very importantly, a beautiful functioning lamp for your home.</p>
<p><strong>THE SCIENCE: </strong></p>
<p><em>From the -  5 Gyres Foundation</em> - ‘One of the most serious threats to our oceans is plastics pollution. Plastic constitutes approximately 90% of all trash floating on the ocean’s surface, with 46,000 pieces of plastic per square mile. Why is there so much plastic in the ocean? Unlike other types of trash, plastic does not biodegrade; instead, it photo-degrades with sunlight, breaking down into smaller and smaller pieces, but they never really disappear. These plastic pieces are eaten by marine life, wash up on beaches, or break down into microscopic plastic dust, attracting more debris.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Plastic is also swept away by ocean currents, landing in swirling vortexes called ocean gyres. The North Pacific Gyre off the coast of California is home to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, the largest ocean garbage site in the world. The floating mass of plastic is twice the size of Texas, with plastic pieces outnumbering sea life by a measure of 6 to 1. These floating garbage sites are impossible to fully clean up.</p>
<p>Plastic poses a significant threat to the health of sea creatures, both big and small. Over 100,000 marine mammals and one million seabirds die each year from ingesting or becoming entangled in plastic.</p>
<p>Plastic is also unusually toxic once it enters the ocean environment. Plastic particles are magnets for different types of pollutants, such as DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and POPs (Persistent Organic Pollutants), and expel harmful chemicals such as BPA (Bisphenol A). Organisms at the bottom of the food chain, such as plankton and krill, ingest the chemicals along with the microscopic plastic particles. As larger fish consume the smaller ones, the chemicals work their way up the food chain. Ultimately, people consume the largest fish, having a devastating effect on human health.</p>
<p>It takes 500-1000 years for plastic to degrade. Even if we stopped using plastics today, they will remain with us for many generations, threatening both human and ocean health. Despite these alarming facts, there are ac</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT THE LAMPS: </strong>Initially we plan to have two solar powered LED lamps, a mini and a maxi Jimmy and a Bibi lamp. Both lamps will have head, hands and feet made from sea washed plastic collected from beaches, the arms, legs and neck will be flexible, stay-put tubing so that the lamps can be bent to take on different characteristics – <strong>they can be a happy or sad as you want them to be</strong>. The feet will be partly cast stone and plastic to give the lamps weight at the feet and thus stability.</p>
<p>The cast body of the lamp will contain the battery and solar charging unit; the solar panel will be at the back of the body so that they can be charged up standing in the window during the day. At the moment the light lasts for four hours per charge but with the new solar units we hope to extend that to six or beyond. <strong>Designing a special unit particular to our needs is one of the important reasons that we are seeking funding.</strong></p>
<p>We will also make mains electricity versions of both the Jimmy and Bibi lamps using a low energy LED bulb. These lamps will initially only be available in the UK and Europe – or as special orders. They will be the same cost as the solar lamps in the standard mini and maxi versions. Special lamp orders will cost more and will be priced on an individual basis.  </p>
<p>tions we can take to address the problem of plastics.’</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT ME: </strong> I make sculptural lamps and have a lamp making business supplying twenty or more shops and galleries in Cornwall, England -  <a href=""http://www.coastlamps.co/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.coastlamps.co</a>   Please take a moment and check it out the lamps have a coastal theme but are very different to the Jimmy/Bibi lamps.</p>
<p>In my youth I collected driftwood and made things and I still do. I’ve lived on or close to the sea most of my life – so the Jimmy Ocean Project is as close to my heart as anything could be.</p>
<p>At one time in my life I was a partner in a company owning five square- rigged sailing ships which we used for film work worldwide – film credits include, Revolution, Columbus, Eric the Viking, Last Place on Earth, Crusoe,  amongst dozens of others.

<strong>REWARDS/TREATS/INVESTMENT</strong> – <strong>What is in it for you?</strong>
</h2>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The Jimmy Ocean Project will only work if millions of people get involved. Those of us enmeshed in the modern consumer society are the villains; to make a real difference to the level of plastic used and discarded would, in a perfect world, need us all to act differently than we do at present.</p>
<p><strong>In essence The Jimmy Ocean Project will belong to everyone.</strong></p>
<p>I’m reminded of an edict from Chairman Mao Zedong when China had a plague of flies – he ordered the entire billion plus Chinese population to kill one hundred flies per day.</p>
<p>In a year that’s a mountain of flies!</p>
<p>Apply the same rule to plastic globally – problem solved!</p>
<p><strong>And we can apply the rule but in a smaller way – social media is the key.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>In this way for instance</strong>: Collect/recycle 100 pieces of plastic, send us an image and your email address and we will reward you with a Jimmy/Bibi Ocean ‘<em>I collected 100 Pieces of plastic’</em> certificate which you can print out.</p>
<p>500 pieces and you will be rewarded with stickers.</p>
<p>1000 pieces and you will be awarded a Jimmy or a beautiful Bibi Ocean badge.</p>
<p>(For the last two categories we’ll need your full postal address.)</p>
<p>And please don't forget to just spread the word, even if you're unable to contribute finanacially then just tell others about The Jimmy Ocean Project because that's what it really all about - SPREADING THE WORD. THANKS.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>By using the rapidly expanding modern communication technology</strong> we have the potential to reach billions of people and that is what makes The Jimmy Ocean Project so exciting – it would have excited Chairman Mao…..… just imagine how many flies he could have ordered to be killed globally via text.</p>
<p><strong>Certificates, stickers and badges</strong> are the starter level and this level will always be free but higher levels will be rewarded with T shirts and mini and maxi Jimmy and Bibi Ocean lamps for which we will need to charge. These can be pre-ordered now with a 10% discount or later bought online from The Jimmy Ocean Project website.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We will be also running a scheme via The Jimmy Ocean Project website where by collecting plastic is rewarded with points which will go towards getting lamps and other merchandising at discount prices– verifying images needed. Details of this scheme will be on the website.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Contributors we want by the millions but partners we would like just two.</strong> Invest $100,000 get 1% per annum of Jimmy Ocean Project net profit not to mention tons of extraordinary eco kudos because you could choose to have your profile on our The Jimmy Ocean Project website. The right partners would also have the opportunity to be part of our merchandising.</p>

Hi, I'm David Raine, My connections with the sea run deep, I’ve owned ocean-going square riggers, sailed dhows, Viking longboats and even dugout canoes,I’ve stroked a sperm whale, talked to dolphins and hugged a shark, made films in the East Greenland ice, the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean and the Norwegian Artic.
And now I have a new challenge. NO PLASTIC FISH ON MY GRAND DAUGHTERS DINNER PLATE. 
IF WE ARE ABLE TO INSPIRE JUST ONE YOUNG PERSON TO DISCOVER THE COMPLETE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF PLASTIC OCEAN POLLUTION - POSSIBLY THROUGH A SCIENTIFIC BREAK-THROUGH OF A NEW RANGE OF PLASTICS THAT BIO-DEGRADE INTO FISH FOOD, THEN WHAT A SUCCESS THIS PROJECT WOULD HAVE BEEN.  YOU CAN MAKE THAT DREAM A REALITY. 
IT TAKES ONLY A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY FROM MANY PEOPLE. BE ONE OF THOSE.
During my lifetime the oceans have become increasingly polluted with discarded plastic and I want to do something about that. I need your help to do it.
Together with my expert team, are running a campaign to raise awareness of plastic pollution in our oceans. The campaign is called The Jimmy Ocean Project and it involves making lamps from rubbish bits of plastic collected on the beach. We want children worldwide to think about how plastic is used and discarded in the future – microscopic plastic is being found by scientists in fish; that is just appalling. Schools will be our focus and our hope when it comes to clearing up the mess that is developing in the seas and on the beaches all over the planet.

THE SERIOUS STUFF!  The core of the problem.
Our oceans are becoming seriously polluted with discarded plastic, billions of pieces that last forever photo-degrading into microscopic pieces that are entering the marine food chain.
In the North Pacific Ocean a floating island of plastic has formed by the gyration of ocean currents which is twice the size of Texas. Floating plastic islands are forming the same way in all oceans.
Granulated plastic is forming beaches on Pacific islands.
Discarded plastic is even reaching the Arctic and the Antarctic – areas that previously were synonymous the idea of pristine nature.
When I collected driftwood as a boy plastic pollution barely existed and now it is the scourge of our beaches and of our seas.

In essence The Jimmy Ocean Project will belong to everyone.
I’m reminded of an edict from Chairman Mao Zedong when China had a plague of flies – he ordered the entire billion plus Chinese population to kill one hundred flies per day.
In a year that’s a mountain of flies!
Apply the same rule to plastic globally – problem solved!
And we can apply the rule but in a smaller way – social media is the key.
 
In this way for instance: Collect/recycle 100 pieces of plastic, send us an image and your email address and we will reward you with a Jimmy/Bibi Ocean ‘I collected 100 Pieces of plastic’ certificate which you can print out.
500 pieces and you will be rewarded with stickers.
1000 pieces and you will be awarded a Jimmy or a beautiful Bibi Ocean badge.
(For the last two categories we’ll need your full postal address.)
And please don't forget to just spread the word, even if you're unable to contribute finanacially then just tell others about The Jimmy Ocean Project because that's what it really all about - SPREADING THE WORD. THANKS.
 
By using the rapidly expanding modern communication technology we have the potential to reach billions of people and that is what makes The Jimmy Ocean Project so exciting – it would have excited Chairman Mao…..… just imagine how many flies he could have ordered to be killed globally via text.
Certificates, stickers and badges are the starter level and this level will always be free but higher levels will be rewarded with T shirts and mini and maxi Jimmy and Bibi Ocean lamps for which we will need to charge. These can be pre-ordered now with a 10% discount or later bought online from The Jimmy Ocean Project website.
 
We will be also running a scheme via The Jimmy Ocean Project website where by collecting plastic is rewarded with points which will go towards getting lamps and other merchandising at discount prices– verifying images needed. Details of this scheme will be on the website.
 
Contributors we want by the millions but partners we would like just two. Invest $100,000 get 1% per annum of Jimmy Ocean Project net profit not to mention tons of extraordinary eco kudos because you could choose to have your profile on our The Jimmy Ocean Project website. The right partners would also have the opportunity to be part of our merchandising.

rt Summary
Contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust. Here are some things to do in this section:

Introduce yourself and your background.
Briefly describe your campaign and why it’s important to you.
Express the magnitude of what contributors will help you achieve.

Remember, keep it concise, yet personal. Ask yourself: if someone stopped reading here would they be ready to make a contribution?


What We Need & What You Get
Break it down for folks in more detail:

Explain how much funding you need and where it’s going. Be transparent and specific—people need to trust you to want to fund you.
Tell people about your unique perks. Get them excited!
Describe where the funds go if you don’t reach your entire goal.



The Impact
Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know how the difference their contribution will make:

Explain why your project is valuable to the contributor and to the world.
Point out your successful track record with projects like this (if you have one).
Make it real for people and build trust.



Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help:

Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign.
Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!


And that’s all there is to it.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">About the Trip (And Me!)</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>For the past two years I taught high school English in Washington, D.C.  Among other roles, I advocated for my students to become environmental stewards and leaders of their communities. Last month I decided to take a break from the classroom to venture into the greater national community for myself.   </p>
<p>My name is Sarah Schaefer and I am going on a grand adventure.  But I need your help. </p>
<p>In the fall of 2013, I, along with eight other people, will embark on and film a three month long canoe journey down the Mississippi River from the headwaters in Lake Itasca, Minnesota, to New Orleans. As we paddle, we will engage communities in an ongoing dialogue about their relationships to and interactions with this watertrail to give voice to the Mississippi River, its inhabitants, and the many perspectives we encounter along the way. Upon completion of the trip, we will produce a documentary of this journey so that these vital conversations can continue with others beyond the flow of the river.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Why Paddle the Mississippi?</strong> </h3>
<p>This is a great question.  As the climate debate comes to a head in the United States, it’s easy to get caught up in abstract political jargon and lose sight of the everyday people whose lives revolve around the health of a natural resource.  Like, say, something as reliably unpredictable as the Mississippi River. </p>
<p>Those who know me probably know that I love creating strong relationships and I’m also a sucker for romance.  Communication is the key to any healthy relationship, so help me create conversations that inspire others to rekindle or reaffirm their love for our country and its beautiful and essential natural resources. </p>
<h3><strong>What I Need:</strong></h3>
<p>So the breakdown is pretty simple.  First and foremost, I need to eat.  I’m asking $720 for all of my food expenses.</p>
<table border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" style=""width: 454px;""><tbody>
<tr>
<td valign=""bottom"">
<p>Food for one day:</p>

</td>
<td valign=""bottom"">
<p align=""right""><strong>$720</strong></p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>While it would be nice if there were no other expenses, there are.  Both myself and my canoe need to come back to Minneapolis in one piece.  The breakdown is as such:</p>
<table border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" style=""width: 454px;""><tbody>
<tr>
<td valign=""bottom"">
<p>Ship a canoe to Minneapolis</p>
</td>

<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;""> </strong></p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What Do You Get If You Help Fund My Campaign?</strong></p>
<p>$25 – a really, REALLY, really big hug, and lots of karma points!</p>
<p>$50 – A personalized postcard from a town along the way, plus hugs and karma points! </p>
<p>$100 – Your name featured in the credits of our documentary, a postcard, a hug, and karma points!</p>
<p>$200 – A shout-out to you or your organization on our twitter and facebook with a picture of me featuring your name or company, your name featured in the credits of our documentary, a postcard, hug, and karma points!</p>
<p>$500 – A Paddle For Change T-Shirt, photo shout-out, your name in the credits, a hug, untold amounts of karma points, and my eternal gratitude. </p>
<h3>
<strong> </strong><strong>The Impact</strong>
</h3>
<p>Without your support, this trip is not possible.  Not only will I personally grow from this challenging and unique experience, but I will connect with new people to develop a constructive dialogue about our lives in the United States and the world.</p>

<p> <em>*All extra funds raised over the $1,000 mark will go directly to a general fund for other members of Paddle For Change.*</em></p></span></div>","About the Trip (And Me!)

For the past two years I taught high school English in Washington, D.C.  Among other roles, I advocated for my students to become environmental stewards and leaders of their communities. Last month I decided to take a break from the classroom to venture into the greater national community for myself.   
My name is Sarah Schaefer and I am going on a grand adventure.  But I need your help. 
In the fall of 2013, I, along with eight other people, will embark on and film a three month long canoe journey down the Mississippi River from the headwaters in Lake Itasca, Minnesota, to New Orleans. As we paddle, we will engage communities in an ongoing dialogue about their relationships to and interactions with this watertrail to give voice to the Mississippi River, its inhabitants, and the many perspectives we encounter along the way. Upon completion of the trip, we will produce a documentary of this journey so that these vital conversations can continue with others beyond the flow of the river.

Why Paddle the Mississippi? 
This is a great question.  As the climate debate comes to a head in the United States, it’s easy to get caught up in abstract political jargon and lose sight of the everyday people whose lives revolve around the health of a natural resource.  Like, say, something as reliably unpredictable as the Mississippi River. 
Those who know me probably know that I love creating strong relationships and I’m also a sucker for romance.  Communication is the key to any healthy relationship, so help me create conversations that inspire others to rekindle or reaffirm their love for our country and its beautiful and essential natural resources. 
What I Need:
So the breakdown is pretty simple.  First and foremost, I need to eat.  I’m asking $720 for all of my food expenses.



Food for one day:


$9




Food for one week:


$63




Food for one month:


$279




Food for the whole trip:


$720



While it would be nice if there were no other expenses, there are.  Both myself and my canoe need to come back to Minneapolis in one piece.  The breakdown is as such:



Ship a canoe to Minneapolis


$130




Pay for one person to travel back to the Twin Cities


$150



                                                                         Total Trip Cost:         $1,000
 
What Do You Get If You Help Fund My Campaign?
$25 – a really, REALLY, really big hug, and lots of karma points!
$50 – A personalized postcard from a town along the way, plus hugs and karma points! 
$100 – Your name featured in the credits of our documentary, a postcard, a hug, and karma points!
$200 – A shout-out to you or your organization on our twitter and facebook with a picture of me featuring your name or company, your name featured in the credits of our documentary, a postcard, hug, and karma points!
$500 – A Paddle For Change T-Shirt, photo shout-out, your name in the credits, a hug, untold amounts of karma points, and my eternal gratitude. 

 The Impact

Without your support, this trip is not possible.  Not only will I personally grow from this challenging and unique experience, but I will connect with new people to develop a constructive dialogue about our lives in the United States and the world.
Upon returning, we will have the incredible opportunity to construct a national dialogue about the Mississippi by creating a documentary of our experiences.  This documentary will spark conversations about our national resources, water usage, the meaning of community, and the very nature (pun!) of what it means to be ""in nature.""  We believe strongly that these are dialogues that our nation must be having more often with one another, and I would be proud to be a part of this legacy.  Besides, everyone likes a good documentary, amiright?

<h3><font size=""4"">Our Story</font></h3>
<p>Ever since I was a young boy I was obsessed with the natural world and wanted to better understand it. I went to college and university for forest conservation. After a few years in the industry I realized this was not the place for someone who actually cares about the environment and healthy approaches to living. After this realization I decided to look into the basic structure of our lives, mainly food and shelter. With many years of research now, it is clear we are not headed in the right direction with either of them. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 800;""><font size=""4"">Modern Development Issues</font></span></p>
<p>We are stuck in the same housing designs we created after world war two when energy costs were low. It is now essentially impossible from a legal stand point, to create a house that will provide the basic functions without governmental inputs and a complete reliance on working to acquire money. After addressing code enforcers on permits for the unorthodox house I wanted to build I decided to build in an unorganized township, meaning no building permits are needed. With this approach I hope to complete the house and then be able to show the public and government, and ensure to them, that it is a safe and viable way to build a home. This will ultimately create a precedent for unconventional, environmentally friendly architecture.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b><font size=""4"">Food</font></b><br/></p>
<p>As for our food system, the additives, the packaging, the reliance on the gas industry etc. I dont really know where to start. As Canadians we have become sitting ducks, we have no back up plan as to where we will get our food from when the oil runs out. We have given up on foresight and forethought it seems. </p>
<p>My girlfriend and I have created six south facing terrace gardens where we grow as much food as we can. We also grow food in our home made greenhouses. We have planted lots of fruit bearing trees and shrubs as well. All of this is to supplement our food that we have to purchase. Slowly we are weaning ourselves off the monetary system and proving ourselves and others with healthy organic natural foods. We have started seed saving and are in the process of creating natural breeds of our own hardy seeds for our northern climate.<br/></p>
<p>Although I have already inspired many individuals who come by to see my life in the woods I will be creating a building school at my property one day and offer a similar program though our local college. <br/></p>

<p style="""">Three years ago I purchased 23.5 acres of mature forest 40 minutes southwest of Thunder Bay Ontario Canada. I have built and are currently developing many buildings.

<p>This project is an ongoing affair, a life's goal and purpose.

<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Any money that you give to my cause will go directly to the creation of this home that I am building. The house is called an earthship. It is constructed with auto mobile tires that are rammed full with earth. It is a passive solar earth bermed house that will be completely self sustainable.</p>
<p>I work at a ski hill all winter and every dollar I earn goes toward this project. The tire walls are almost completed on the house. This year I am going to do timber framed posts and beams and the rafters and planking for the roof. All these things cost money. The goal is to get the house closed in this year. If this does not happen the winter will probably do a great deal of damage. We need your help to ensure that we can achieve this essential stage of development.<br/></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi all, Stephanie here.  I was 1 of 13 people arrested on September 16th, protesting the building of the northern extension of the Keystone XL Pipeline, a pipeline that will carry tar sands from Alberta, Canada to Steele City, Nebraska, where it will continue on until it reaches refineries in Houston and Port Arthur, Texas.  </p>
<p>Over 60 protesters joined us in our demonstration on Monday to send a message that the American people do not want tar sands.  We don't want them because: </p>
<ul>
<li>The extraction of tar sands from the ground is energy intensive and degrades the environment.</li>
<li>Potential spills are really risky in areas that are dependent on agriculture: access to clean soil and clean water is a must!</li>
<li>Refining the tar sands will bring even more toxic air to lower income communities in Texas that already suffer significantly high rates of cancer.</li>
<li>Tar sand oil does not mean energy independence -- most of it will be shipped overseas to China and will likely raise gas prices here in the US.</li>
<li>The production and combustion of the tar sand oil will increase atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, which we know is a contributing factor to climate change.</li>
</ul>
<p>The 13 of us feel so passionately about this that we risked arrest and told President Obama and the folks at the TransCanada office in Downtown Houston that we don't want the tar sands: we want our leaders to make better choices for our people and for our planet.  </p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 30px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span><br/></p>
<p>Getting arrested is a huge financial burden.  We were charged with criminal trespassing, which is up to a $1000 fine -- per person.  Because there were 13 of us, that equals $13,000.  We have good lawyers on the case, but we still anticipate some hefty fines and court costs.  Here's the deal:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are asking for $2000 to help get us started.</li>
<li>But wait, if we reach our goal, no need to stop.  $2000 is nowhere near the potential maximum cost of fines.  So thus, the more help, the better.</li>
<li>Any money donated will go to fines, court costs, associated legal fees, and transportation for our out-of-town compatriots.</li>
<li>By donating, you'll get the satisfaction of standing with us against the pipeline, against TransCanada, against tar sand extraction, against environmental racism, and against climate change.  Show us your love and support for the Earth and all of us living here!</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Keystone XL Pipeline is currently under review by the State Department.  Last Spring, the State Department released an Environmental Impact Statement that was drafted by a contracting company called ERM that had also worked with TransCanada.  Conflict of interest?  </p>
<p>Because the State Department does not appear to be working in the interest of the American people, we need to take a stand.  The protest in Houston was a way to get the attention of the decision makers to let them know that we Americans do not want this pipeline.  And to let President Obama know that if he approves the pipeline, more demonstrations will come.</p>
<p>Our work certainly got media attention.  Local media outlets such as <a href=""http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/local&amp;id=9250577"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ABC</a> and <a href=""http://app1.kuhf.org/articles/1379342393-Houston-Police-Make-Arrests-During-Keystone-XL-Pipeline-Protest.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">KUHF</a> picked us up and we were covered nationally by AP and UPI wire stories.  Not to mention <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-09-16/its-climate-week-on-capitol-hill-and-keystone-xl-endgame-is-on"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bloomberg Financial News</a>.  We got their attention alright.  </p>
<p>Now we need your help to keep us going!  We want to keep up this work, and the quicker we get through the legal system, the quicker we'll be able to return to our activism.  This is a community effort so now we ask for your assistance.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Remember, a little bit goes a long way.  If you have $5, $50 or even $500 to spare, everything is appreciated with love and gratitude.  But if your budget is too tight, you can still help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the word out!  Tweet, Facebook, dial a friend etc.  Use your favorite social media to ask others to support us.  Make some noise for us!</li>

<h3>Our background</h3>
<p></p>
<p><i><b>Reserva El Timbre</b></i></p>
<p>Alberto
started his work in the community of Piedra Labrada in the Sierra of Santa
Marta in 2003, where he took part in a series of anthropological projects during
his university degree. Nele joined him in 2004 as a social pedagogue. The community
work resulted in the formation of <a href=""https://chikutun.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Chiku Tun</a>, an interdisciplinary group working
on investigation, administration and diffusion of living heritage. </p>
<p>Until
recently, Alberto was the founder and director of La Casa Verde Ecomuseo, an
environmental educational centre in the city of Veracruz, where he had a great
collection of animals (mainly reptiles), beautiful wall paintings and an edible
and medicinal garden. He organized plenty of activities to create ecological
awareness for children, adolescents and adults. Check it out on the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ecomuseolacasaverde/?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Casa Verde facebook-page. </a></p>
<p>At the same
time, Alberto developed his theatrical persona with <i>Tío Tlacuache</i> (Uncle Opossum), telling the myth of Jomshuk, the god
of corn of the Popolucas, in schools and public places. Although the story mainly
refers to the origins of corn, Alberto uses this opportunity to include many messages
to encourage the public to care for our planet, its animals and plants. On
<a href=""http://tiotlacuache.blogspot.mx/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://tiotlacuache.blogspot.mx/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">his blog</a> you can get to know more about Tío Tlacuache and his
adventures.</p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457462103/j3aw8wxp4k1gpxtlamyp.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 324px;height: 216px;""/></p>
<p>Besides his
anthropological and educational initiatives, Alberto is also an experienced and
enthusiastic musician under the name <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/zopilote-radiante-y-los-7"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Zopilote Radiante</a>. He in particular uses his music as a medium to raise
environmental awareness. The video of the song ‘<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA4CF8EOs5Y"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Selva</a>’ was shot in Piedra
Labrada. </p>
<p>After
finishing her studies in Mexico in 2008, Nele worked for 5 years as a
consultant in a non-profit organization. During this time she dealt in
particular with issues surrounding ethnic-cultural diversity in schools and
townships in Belgium. </p>
<p>But her love
for plants and nature was strong. She started studying herbalism for two years.
An experience that proved fruitful in 2014 when she ventured out to Costa Rica
to work on an organic farm. Shortly after, Nele settled in Veracruz where she
enjoys getting her hands dirty with sowing and planting. She started her
own product line called <i>Pak</i> with
ecological products like mosquito repellent, tooth powder and marmalades. Whilst
at the same time she continues supporting Alberto with his projects. </p>
<p>For almost
20 years she was an active member in the Scouts in Belgium where
she gained her respect for nature, knowledge about camping and working
with groups of children and youngsters. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><i><b>Selva del Toztlan</b></i></p>
<p>For more
than 25 years, Victor and Isabel have been looking for a way to share their
love for nature and its creatures. Together with their son and daughter, they
have dived in nearly all of the Mexican seawaters. They combine this with
full-time employment as businessman and English teacher. After work hours, they
organize nature camps for children, where they search for protected blue crabs
and sea turtle eggs during breeding season. Their passion for conservation has
clearly inspired their son Victor jr. who is following in their footsteps and graduated
with a master in wild conservation. </p>
<p>In 2008 they
met Paco and Edith, both biologists with a vast experience of working in nature
reserves and wildlife conservation research in the region of Los Tuxtlas. They
have been wanting to establish a non-profit organization to formalize their
efforts but failed, until recently, to find the right partners. </p>
<p></p>
<p>In the
meantime and with a view of continuing their efforts they bought several
hectares of rainforest, mangrove and pasture in El Porvenir (Catemaco) and
Sontecomapan; and have worked hard to reforest, to maintain and protect wildlife
as well as to create a sense of ecological conscience within the community. </p>

The campaign 

Given that
we spent our entire savings on the acquisition of the land and the construction
of a small eco-shelter, we are currently looking for additional funds to cover
expenditures related to starting a non-profit organization and to undertake some
much needed maintenance work in the nature reserve.  And that’s why we are launching this campaign…
With your
support we aim to:


Pay the consultancy, proceedings and notary costs to establish the non-profit organization ""Selva del Toztlan"";
Realize maintenance works in the Reserva El Timbre: tracing a safe walking trail, constructing a composting toilet and installing a rainwater collection system.
You can find more information about the Reserva El Timbre on Facebook.



What we need & what you get




The establishment of the non-profit organization
With the
establishment of a non-profit organization we will be able to receive subsidies
and tax-deductible donations, national and internationally. That way we can work
fulltime on the preservation and restoration of the different ecosystems that
we are managing.
To progress
the establishment of the non-profit organization and to ensure we meet all
legal requirements, we invoked the assistance of an international consultant on
non-profit organizations, Alejandro Coria Bretón. His fees, together with the
notary payments, will amount to approximately 1.475 US dollars (26.500 Mexican pesos).

Equipping the Reserva El Timbre
There’s
still some work to do in the nature reserve. We have calculated a cost of 1.815 US dollars (32.670 Mexican pesos),
breaking this budget down in:
A safe walking trail: 1.083 USD (19.490 MXN)


Working tools for trail tracing including a small chain saw, spades, machetes and files: 492 USD (8.850 MXN)

Signs: information, indication and warning signs to put aside the trail: 111 USD (2.000 MXN)

Our background

Reserva El Timbre
Alberto
started his work in the community of Piedra Labrada in the Sierra of Santa
Marta in 2003, where he took part in a series of anthropological projects during
his university degree. Nele joined him in 2004 as a social pedagogue. The community
work resulted in the formation of Chiku Tun, an interdisciplinary group working
on investigation, administration and diffusion of living heritage. 
Until
recently, Alberto was the founder and director of La Casa Verde Ecomuseo, an
environmental educational centre in the city of Veracruz, where he had a great
collection of animals (mainly reptiles), beautiful wall paintings and an edible
and medicinal garden. He organized plenty of activities to create ecological
awareness for children, adolescents and adults. Check it out on the Casa Verde facebook-page. 
At the same
time, Alberto developed his theatrical persona with Tío Tlacuache (Uncle Opossum), telling the myth of Jomshuk, the god
of corn of the Popolucas, in schools and public places. Although the story mainly
refers to the origins of corn, Alberto uses this opportunity to include many messages
to encourage the public to care for our planet, its animals and plants. On
his blog you can get to know more about Tío Tlacuache and his
adventures.


Besides his
anthropological and educational initiatives, Alberto is also an experienced and
enthusiastic musician under the name Zopilote Radiante. He in particular uses his music as a medium to raise
environmental awareness. The video of the song ‘Selva’ was shot in Piedra
Labrada. 
After
finishing her studies in Mexico in 2008, Nele worked for 5 years as a
consultant in a non-profit organization. During this time she dealt in
particular with issues surrounding ethnic-cultural diversity in schools and
townships in Belgium. 
But her love
for plants and nature was strong. She started studying herbalism for two years.
An experience that proved fruitful in 2014 when she ventured out to Costa Rica
to work on an organic farm. Shortly after, Nele settled in Veracruz where she
enjoys getting her hands dirty with sowing and planting. She started her
own product line called Pak with
ecological products like mosquito repellent, tooth powder and marmalades. Whilst
at the same time she continues supporting Alberto with his projects. 
For almost
20 years she was an active member in the Scouts in Belgium where
she gained her respect for nature, knowledge about camping and working
with groups of children and youngsters. 

Selva del Toztlan
For more
than 25 years, Victor and Isabel have been looking for a way to share their
love for nature and its creatures. Together with their son and daughter, they
have dived in nearly all of the Mexican seawaters. They combine this with
full-time employment as businessman and English teacher. After work hours, they
organize nature camps for children, where they search for protected blue crabs
and sea turtle eggs during breeding season. Their passion for conservation has
clearly inspired their son Victor jr. who is following in their footsteps and graduated
with a master in wild conservation. 
In 2008 they
met Paco and Edith, both biologists with a vast experience of working in nature
reserves and wildlife conservation research in the region of Los Tuxtlas. They
have been wanting to establish a non-profit organization to formalize their
efforts but failed, until recently, to find the right partners. 

In the
meantime and with a view of continuing their efforts they bought several
hectares of rainforest, mangrove and pasture in El Porvenir (Catemaco) and
Sontecomapan; and have worked hard to reforest, to maintain and protect wildlife
as well as to create a sense of ecological conscience within the community.

<p>We are the Friends of Theodore Roethke, a 501(c)(3) non-profit based in Saginaw, Michigan, and we need your help to save a historic home part of the Theodore Roethke Home Museum!</p>
<p><br/>The Roethke House (more officially, the Theodore Roethke Home Museum) is the childhood home of the Pulitzer Prize winning poet, <a href=""http://www.roethkehouse.org/theodore_roethke.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Theodore Roethke</a>, (1908-1963). Located at 1805 Gratiot Avenue in Saginaw, Michigan, the Roethke House has been preserved by the Friends of Theodore Roethke Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit foundation whose mission is to promote, preserve and protect the literary legacy of Theodore Roethke by restoring his family residences in Saginaw, Michigan, for cultural and educational opportunities.</p>
<p>The Roethke House was designated  a National Literary Landmark in 2004 in recognition of the profound impact Roethke had on American poetry and the influence his home had on his writing. A Michigan Historic Marker marks its location and the house is included in the National Register of Historic Sites. <a href=""http://www.roethkehouse.org/tours.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tours</a> of The Roethke House are available. In addition, poetry readings, talks, workshops, and school programs are regularly offered. A year-long series of events, supported by major grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Michigan Humanities Council celebrated Roethke‘s Centennial in 2008-2009.</p>
<p>Friends of Theodore Roethke Foundation has been in existence for over ten years. Currently, the organization is working on capital funding to renovate the Roethke Home Museum, restore the adjacent Carl Roethke residence at 1759 Gratiot into a cultural/educational center with classrooms, and add a greenhouse pavilion for arts events.</p>
<p><br/>1759 Gratiot, built in the early 1900's, is in extreme disrepair. We've barely had money to pay the mortagage on the properties in recent years, and now we need to do some major repairs before the house is a total loss. Specifically, we need to prop up and fix the back porch of the house before it completely falls down.</p>
<p>Please donate to help us save this historic property so we may continue promulating the life and legacy of Theodore Roethke in his hometown!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
We really need about $4,000 RIGHT NOW so this porch does not fall down--and take the house with it!</div>

<div>Since we're a non-profit, all donations are tax-deductible. If you wish, you can contact us directly about memberships for the organization. (<a href=""http://www.roethkehouse.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.roethkehouse.org</a>)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Even if we do not raise all the money needed, we still need to fix the porch (and so many other things!). We'll move ahead with the project regardless, but it would be especially nice to know how we're going to pay for it!</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
By helping us save this house, we can continue with our plan to transform 1759 Gratiot into a center for community outreach in the community. Saginaw, Michigan is one of the poorest and most dangerous areas in Michigan. This community needs educational and cultural opportunities, especially related to history and writing, to help transform it into the great cultural center it once was.</div>

<strong>OUR STORY</strong>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p>In 1989, a group of young, idealistic newcomers to Hawai'i,
frustrated over the lack of recycling services in the islands, set out to
change things by literally taking matters into their own hands. They used a
number of tactics, one of which was to divert plastic, paper and tin cans going
into county trash roll-offs to the back of their parked cars instead.  Nearly a quarter of a century later, the
501(c)3 educational non-profit they formed in 1992 has become <strong>RECYCLE HAWAI'I </strong> the state's
premier recycling organization, with 19 fulltime employees providing a range of
recycling and related educational services, including the operation of six
re-use centers across Hawai'i Island. </p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1243518/files/20150223152522-KHRRC_by_Paul_J_Buklarewicz.jpg?1424733922"" src="""" style=""width: 577.33px; height: 433px;""/></p><p><br/></p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p>While the development of the organization has been largely
funded by contracts with the Hawai'i County Department of Environmental
Management, the recent loss of one of those contracts, worth $100,000, has
brought our zero waste outreach and education programs to a screeching halt, compelling us
to launch this fundraising campaign.  </p><div>
</div><p>We seek to raise $60,000, with all contributions going
directly towards continuing our outreach education programs.  The funds will be allocated as follows:</p><p><br/></p><div>

</div><p><strong>OUR IMPACT</strong></p><div>
</div><p>Over the nine years we have been holding the annual <em><em><em><em>Art of
Recycling Contest</em></em></em></em>, Recycle Hawai’i has attracted 4,500 participants with 1,650
of them student artists. This program encourages everyone involved to
appreciate the inherent value of commonly discarded items as a means to promote
ingenuity and respect for resources.  Art
entries go on display in the community where they were created and this
additional exposure spreads the important message to the students’ peers and
mentors.  For many of the students involved,
the competition is a formative experience that allows them to re-imagine the

</div></div>","OUR STORY

In 1989, a group of young, idealistic newcomers to Hawai'i,
frustrated over the lack of recycling services in the islands, set out to
change things by literally taking matters into their own hands. They used a
number of tactics, one of which was to divert plastic, paper and tin cans going
into county trash roll-offs to the back of their parked cars instead.  Nearly a quarter of a century later, the
501(c)3 educational non-profit they formed in 1992 has become RECYCLE HAWAI'I  the state's
premier recycling organization, with 19 fulltime employees providing a range of
recycling and related educational services, including the operation of six
re-use centers across Hawai'i Island. 

While the development of the organization has been largely
funded by contracts with the Hawai'i County Department of Environmental
Management, the recent loss of one of those contracts, worth $100,000, has
brought our zero waste outreach and education programs to a screeching halt, compelling us
to launch this fundraising campaign.  
We seek to raise $60,000, with all contributions going
directly towards continuing our outreach education programs.  The funds will be allocated as follows:


$10,000 for Zero Waste School Presentations to students and teachers K─12, 
$10,000 to hold our 10th
Annual Art of Recycling School Competition, an islandwide exhibit of art made
from recycled materials by K─12 students,

$25,000 to continue our Composting
is Recycling, Too! education workshops offered monthly throughout Hawai’i
Island,
$15,000 for these additional outreach efforts:
● The Recycling
InfoLines, a 24/7 answering service for the east and west sides of Hawai'i
Island where callers can get answers to their recycling questions,
● The Hawai’i Island
Recycling Guide, a complete listing of local recycling services, updated
regularly, widely distributed & available on our website,
● The Recycle Hawai’i website upgrade, to better provide
recycling & educational resources, news, articles and notice of events,
● Zero Waste community event support & training.


The above list is ordered by priority, funding below our
goal will be allocated accordingly. Extra funds will be used to continue
programs into the next fiscal year.  All
funds raised can also serve as matching funds to garner grants. 




OUR IMPACT
Over the nine years we have been holding the annual Art of
Recycling Contest, Recycle Hawai’i has attracted 4,500 participants with 1,650
of them student artists. This program encourages everyone involved to
appreciate the inherent value of commonly discarded items as a means to promote
ingenuity and respect for resources.  Art
entries go on display in the community where they were created and this
additional exposure spreads the important message to the students’ peers and
mentors.  For many of the students involved,
the competition is a formative experience that allows them to re-imagine the
wasteful practices they are exposed to on a regular basis. 

Since its inception in 2004, our “Composting is Recycling,
Too!” program has brought experts in the recovery of discarded organic
materials into communities islandwide where they have presented 262 home
composting and vermiculture workshops, teaching participants how to turn food
scraps, food contaminated paper and yard trimmings into valuable soil
amendments.  While most view Hawai’i as a
lush Paradise, the truth is our soils are poor in the organic matter needed to
produce food crops. Capturing this resource, diverting it from the landfill and
turning it into soil provides a valuable service to humankind and Mother Earth.
During the course of our program, a total of 4,050 Earth Machines were
distributed to schools and households where they were used to contain organic
materials during the composting process, with each system providing the
potential to divert up to 10 tons of organic matter over its 10-year life. This
amounts to 405,000 tons of materials diverted from the landfill by the units
already in service. Based on the cost to purchase and distribute these systems,
the cost of processing these materials is $5.50 per ton, a $79.50 savings per
ton on what it costs our local government to landfill.  



By comparison, our Zero Waste Initiative is a relatively new
program, active for only three years, but quickly becoming one of our most
important public offerings. Through this hands-on outreach effort, volunteers
install and manage sort stations that protect the value of discarded items at a
variety of community happenings and organizers collaborate with attendees to create
a waste-free event. Over the years we’ve been using this diversion method,
we’ve achieved an average 90% diversion rate. . . much to the amazement and

<br/><h3>Alessandra and the Turtles</h3>
<div>The question is always the same: why turtles?</div>
<div>It is always very hard for me to answer. Of course, sea turtles are ancient, elegant, mysterious animals and this is the reason why I first got interested in these creatures. But the more I study them, the more I understand that turtles are more than this: they are part of the ocean and they remind us of its importance. </div>

<h4>My story</h4>
<div>I left my family in Italy to go to France when I was 19, to follow my dream of becoming a Marine Biologist. In Marseilles, I got a degree in Biological Oceanography. At the same time, I  learned how to scuba dive and I did an internship about Green Turtles in New Zealand. </div>
<div>In September, I left for Costa Rica, where I spent 3 months on Caletas Beach working as a Research Assistant with an NGO to save sea turtles.</div>
<div>Caletas Project was my life-changing experience: for 3 months I patrolled Caletas Beach in search of nesting turtles, I collected thousands of eggs which gave birth to thousands of baby turtles that we released in the Pacific Ocean. During this period I experienced the joy of feeling that I was doing something to change things. Working with turtles is amazing and every day is a new adventure. I recommend you volunteering if you are looking for an experience to remember!</div>
<div>Now, I want to get more experience, increasing my responsibilities and duties. I applied for a Coordinator position with ARCAS, an NGO in Guatemala, at El Hawaii National Park and I got the job! I am very excited!</div>
<div><p><br/></p></div>
</div></div>","The ""coordinator dream""
It was really unexpected. I got the email and the answer was ""Yes, we want you as coordinator of our park!""
When I did the interview with ARCAS, I knew I was aiming high: I am only 22 and I will have to coordinate a National Park.
But yes, they want me! I will be the coordinator of El Hawaii National Park for 8 months and I feel I am getting closer to the objective of my life.
If you are getting interested in my adventure and you want to save sea turtles, keep on reading!




How you can help 

Being El Hawaii Coordinator for 8 months is going to be challenging and enriching, but it is an unpaid position. You can do a lot with your donation! 

What I will be doing
As a coordinator I will work with ARCAS to fight against sea turtles extinction.
Take part in our fight! With your donation we can realize our projects of conservation and education.  

Conservation




- Beach patrols: I will organize the patrols on the beach in search of nesting turtles and I will collect eggs and data from them. We will bury the eggs in a protected zone, the hatchery, and we will wait for the babies to hatch to release them. We need patrol equipment to protect the nests from predators and humans!! 
- Gather a great number of data that ARCAS and other conservation organizations can use to improve sea turtles protection, for example promoting new laws. 
- Research: the park director and I, have already started working on a new research project and we have plenty of ideas!



Education





- Work with volunteers: I will not patrol on my own, I will share this experience with groups of volunteers coming from all over the world. Volunteers are essential to help ARCAS in its conservation actions.
- Local community: I will help ARCAS organize plenty of activities with the local communities, to raise awareness among adults, to improve a local sustainable economy and to educate children.
Not only turtles 

- ARCAS protects the wildlife of the entire Hawaii Park.
- rehabilitation and restoration projects of endangered populations, such as the spider monkey and the yellow-naped amazon, will be organized




The costs


Round-trip ticket Milan-Guatemala City: $ 850 


VISA run trips: $ 600 (in total, for the 8 months). I will have to renew my VISA every 3 months, so I will have to travel towards a neighbouring country and spend 1 night there before going back to Guatemala.
Free week: $ 1200 (total for the 8 months). I will have 8 consecutive days to rest every month, where I'll have to buy my own food . 
Malaria prevention treatment: $ 60 
Equipment : $ 120. I will need good jogging shoes for the beach patrols, mosquito net, insect repellent and anti-histamine cream (both very expensive) etc.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Gary Spedding, I am a 21 year old 
Zoology Student at University and I have been coming and going back and 
forward to the Occupied Palestinian Territories for just over 2 years 
now. Last year was a life changing time for me when I learned about the 
power of nonviolence. The principles and Ideas that I discovered and 
formed from experiencing nonviolence gave me empowerment to do something
 that embodies this form of active resistance to the occupation. It is a
 very dignified way for Palestinians to resist as it does not hurt 
anybody and it is also human rights based rather than politically 
motivated. Last year myself and three others decided to put together a group and campaign to help combat this aspect of the occupation<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The campaign impacts 
upon the local people here in various ways there is of course the 
immediate impact of empowerment in acting out resistance to occupation 
by planting olive trees (The areas of planting these trees are often in 
places where they have been previously cut down or removed for 'security
 reasons' or on land which has been illegally confiscated by the state 
of Israel and access sometimes denied to the land owners). This campaign allows 
farmers to nonviolently resist while also giving them hope and 
empowerment. It brings to life their struggle while using the principles
 of nonviolence. There is of course an economic impact as many farmers 
cannot afford to replace olive trees that have been growing in their 
land for hundreds of years just like that so it helps ease the burden of
 replaciing trees while also providing a sustainable method of making 
money in the future through agriculture. Finally there is an 
environmental impact as while israel is uprooting trees which obviously 
impacts human beings quite simply the sheer amount of trees being 
uprooted is causing environmental concerns damaging wildlife and the 
natural balance here in Palestine.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The
 funding in its entirety goes directly towards paying local tree growers
 in Palestine for their trees and then those trees go directly to the 
land where they are to be planted. Every single penny will go towards 
trees and transport costs. We decided to pay locals for the trees in 
order to make the campaign an all around success for the local people 
benefiting the man who sells the sapplings and the man who will see 
those saplings through to adulthood in his land. We will be happy to 
name plots of trees after specific donors if they request and we can 
also send if availability lasts two olive leaves dipped in a thin layer 
of sealing metal. However our primary goal and concern is the olive 
trees and getting them planted. We will be documenting our planting as 
it goes along and sending each donor a professional picture of what 
their money has bought. If the target is not met the funding will still 
go towards planting olive trees so any amount raised will help.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>This 
campaign is mainly about the replacement of trees and the reclaimation 
of land. However there is an important awareness raising factor to it as
 well which combines all kinds of information ranging from human rights 
and the impunity in which Palestinians are denied access to their lands 
while settlers take over it. All the way to nonviolence and how planting
 trees is a brilliant way of resisting pressure and 
occupation/persecution. Please use the share options and spread this 
project around!<br/></p>

My name is Gary Spedding, I am a 21 year old 
Zoology Student at University and I have been coming and going back and 
forward to the Occupied Palestinian Territories for just over 2 years 
now. Last year was a life changing time for me when I learned about the 
power of nonviolence. The principles and Ideas that I discovered and 
formed from experiencing nonviolence gave me empowerment to do something
 that embodies this form of active resistance to the occupation. It is a
 very dignified way for Palestinians to resist as it does not hurt 
anybody and it is also human rights based rather than politically 
motivated. Last year myself and three others decided to put together a group and campaign to help combat this aspect of the occupation

<br/><h3>DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE COFFEE CAME FROM?</h3><p>Billions of people in the world drink coffee everyday and most of them do not know how the coffee is produced. Coffee is a fruit that looks like a cherry and to produce the coffee that everyone drinks every day we only use  the bean, the remain (the pulp) is throw away in the environment, inducing important environmental impacts, for instance:</p><ul><li><p>Coffee waste soil deposit can impoverish the soil, reducing his fertility (see the Embrapa <a href=""http://www.sapc.embrapa.br/antigo/index.php/start-download/i-simposio-de-pesquisa-dos-cafes-do-brasil/446-contaminacao-do-solo-em-areas-de-deposito-de-cascas-de-frutos-de-cafeeiro1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">study here</a>)</p></li></ul><ul>
<li><p>Coffee waste disposal on the soil participates in global warming: coffee waste is usually decomposed by bacterial processes, releasing large amounts of greenhouse gases (methane, CO2 and N2O). Between 23 and 55 Megatons of methane per year are released in the atmosphere by the coffee waste (see the Oxford <a href=""http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/research/energy/downloads/methaneuk/methaneukreport.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">study here</a>)</p></li>
<li>Coffee waste disposal in the rivers disturbing the ecosystem: as an organic material, coffee waste contains lot of nutrients, causing an increase of algae. Negative environmental effects include hypoxia, the depletion of oxygen in the water, which may cause death to aquatic animals and results in unpleasant smells (see the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment journal <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22160475"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">study here</a>)</li>

The Cophenol solution will convert the coffee pulp into valuable chemicals products that can be used to make paper, plastic and biochar. The biochar is a type of natural fertilizer that we will to give to the coffee producer with no charge to enhance soil fertility and agricultural productivity. Inside a circular economy model, we see in the coffee waste an opportunity to implement the 5R model (reduce, recycle, replace, return, reuse) involving the local community on it.</p><h3>WHERE ARE WE NOW ?</h3><p>The results of our first experiments of the chemical process with the coffee waste as well as a preliminary study market encouraged us to continue forward the project.</p><p>The idea is to start in Brazil, in the states of Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo, due to the important coffee production and also due to the Brazilian scenario of competitiveness and market strategy.</p><p>Currently, the Cophenol team is in Brazil to meet with important stakeholders to succeed with Cophenol’s project: coffee producers, coffee cooperatives, local environmental and business organisation, coffee research centers and universities.</p><h3>NOW OUR TEAM</h3><p>Cophenol was born in 2014 inside a multicultural, multidisciplinary and very motivated team.

SAVEZ VOUS D’OÙ VIENT LE CAFÉ ? Des milliards de personnes dans le monde boivent du café tous les jours et la plupart d'entre eux ne savent pas comment il est produit.Le café est un fruit qui ressemble à une cerise amis nous utilisons uniquement le noyau pour produire le café que nous consommons, le reste du fruit, la pulpe, est jetée dans l'environnement, entraînant des pollutions importantes :Les déchets de café entraînent un déséquilibre des nutriments des sols dans lesquels ils sont enfouis et polluent les nappes phréatiques (voir l'étude en portugais d’embrapa ici)Les déchets de café laissés sur les sols participent au réchauffement climatique : ils  sont généralement décomposés par des des micro-organismes, libérant des quantités importantes de gaz à effet de serre (méthane (CH4), dioxyde de carbone (CO2) et du protoxyde d'azote (N2O)). Entre 23 et 55 Méga tonnes de méthane par an sont relarguées dans l’atmosphère par les déchets végétaux (voir l'étude d'Oxford ici)Les déchets de café déversés dans les rivières perturbent leur écosystème par utrophisation :  ils contiennent beaucoup de nutriments, provoquant une prolifération d’algues, entraînant une diminution de l’oxygène dans l’eau qui peut être mortelle pour les animaux aquatiques (voir l'étude du journal Environmental Monitoring and Assessment ici).SOLUTION DU PROJET DE START UP COPHENOLNous voulons empêcher ces déchets de nuire à l'environnement par la construction de bioraffineries durables situées près des plantations de café afin de convertir ces déchets de café en produits chimiques utilisés pour fabriquer du papier, du plastique et des engrais que nous prévoyons de donner aux producteurs de café.OU EN SOMMES NOUS ? Les résultats de nos premières expériences du processus chimique avec les déchets de café ainsi qu’une étude de marché préliminaire nous ont encouragé à continuer d’avancer sur ce projet.Nous souhaitons commencer notre développement au Brésil, plus précisément dans les états de Minas Gerias et São Paulo, en raison de l'importante production de café et de leur économie.C’est pourquoi nous sommes actuellement au Brésil pour un mois afin de rencontrer toutes les parties prenantes nécessaire à la réalisation du projet Cophenol : les producteurs de café et des coopératives, les organisations de protection de l'environnement, les entreprises locales, les centres de recherches sur le café et nos clients potentiels.NOTRE EQUIPECophenol est né en 2014 et son équipe est constituée de membres multidisciplinaires et multiculturels très motivés, qui sont tous très sensibles à la protection de l’environnement. De gauche à droite : Emmanuel Thiéry (25 ans, Français) vient de terminer sa licence de physique chimie après avoir eu un master en neurosciences. Il a travaillé avec Anna Suchy sur le procédé chimique qui transforme les déchets de café en produits chimiques de valeur. Dirigeant le projet, il travaille sur la stratégie du développement de Cophenol et postule avec le reste de l’équipe dans diverses compétitions de start-up afin de trouver soutiens et financements pour le projet.Anna Suchy (25 ans, Polonaise) est actuellement en thèse sur la valorisation de la biomasse dans l'Université d'Aberystwyth, au Pays de Galles (Royaume-Uni). Elle travaille sur l’optimisation du processus chimique utilisé par Cophenol.Pierre Eloi Gay (24 ans, Français) est fraîchement diplômé de l’ESSEC. Il a étudié pendant sept mois à São Paulo et son expertise sur les études de marché nous aide à trouver des clients brésiliens potentiels.Mariana Bittencourt (30 ans, Brésilienne) est actuellement en thèse  sur les éco-innovations en France. Elle communique avec les parties prenantes locales du projet, notamment les coopératives et les producteurs de café qui sont cruciaux pour notre projet. De plus, elle est en contact avec les ministres, le gouvernement et les institutions importantes afin de préparer au mieux notre implantation au Brésil.COMPÉTITIONS GAGNÉESAu cours de son développement, Cophenol a reçu du soutien grâce à plusieurs compétitions de start-up gagnées :               Cophenol a été sélectionné dans la Greenhouse à Paris, qui est un programme de pré-incubation de la Climate-KIC, la structure européenne promeut les initiatives combattant le changement climatique. Nous avons reçu 4 000 € ainsi qu’un accompagnement par un coach de l'incubateur Agoranov.Cophenol a été sélectionné pour faire partie de la finale francophone de la Global Social Venture Competition (GSVC). Nous avons reçu l'aide d’étudiants en master à l'ESSEC et de Florian Buguet qui travaille dans le cabinet de conseil Deloitte afin d’améliorer notre business model.http://www.gsvc-essec.org/cophenol/Cophenol est lauréat de la compétition nationale ""I-LAB"" qui récompense les projets d'entrepreneuriats étudiants. Nous recevrons 5 000 € quand nous lancerons notre start-up en France. Cophenol Lauréat d'I-LabPOURQUOI NOUS AIDER ?En nous aidant, vous soutenez un projet dont le but est de préserver l’environnement pour nous et les générations futures.Grâce à l'aide financière de la Greenhouse, nous avons pu payer les principales dépenses de ce voyage. Mais nous avons toujours besoin de financer nos déplacements au Brésil afin de pouvoir rencontrer plus de producteurs de café et de coopératives qui sont dispersés dans Minas Gerais et São Paulo.Ensemble, nous pouvons faire un grand changement!Suivez nous sur twitter, facebook et sur notre site internet cophenol.comRÉCOMPENSES SPÉCIALES                               Mug Cophenol Collector  (20 dollars, remise en main propre gratuite sur Paris)  : Lorsque que vous boirez votre café dans cette tasse, vous vous souviendriez que vous soutenez un projet qui va rendre votre boisson préférée plus respectueuse de l'environnement.                                               Cadeau Cophenol aléatoire  (30 dollars, livraison gratuite en France). Pendant notre voyage, nous collectons de magnifiques et intéressants objets brésiliens (Cristaux de Minas Gerais, accessoires, gâteaux locaux, vêtements…) Si vous avez des suggestions, n'hésitez pas à nous demander ! MISES A JOUR : 9 août 2015
Merci pour vos dons ! La semaine dernière, nous avons pu aller à Minas Gerais et parcourir environ 2 000 km pour rencontrer 2 coopératives, 2 producteurs de café et un torréfacteur. Nous avons récupérer environ 30 kilos de déchets de café que nous devront envoyer par colis en Europe pour continuer nos expériences.Nous y retournerons dans une semaine afin de rencontrer d'autres producteurs de café ainsi que la fédération des coopératives de la région qui souhaite nous rencontrer.

DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE COFFEE CAME FROM?Billions of people in the world drink coffee everyday and most of them do not know how the coffee is produced. Coffee is a fruit that looks like a cherry and to produce the coffee that everyone drinks every day we only use  the bean, the remain (the pulp) is throw away in the environment, inducing important environmental impacts, for instance:Coffee waste soil deposit can impoverish the soil, reducing his fertility (see the Embrapa study here)
Coffee waste disposal on the soil participates in global warming: coffee waste is usually decomposed by bacterial processes, releasing large amounts of greenhouse gases (methane, CO2 and N2O). Between 23 and 55 Megatons of methane per year are released in the atmosphere by the coffee waste (see the Oxford study here)
Coffee waste disposal in the rivers disturbing the ecosystem: as an organic material, coffee waste contains lot of nutrients, causing an increase of algae. Negative environmental effects include hypoxia, the depletion of oxygen in the water, which may cause death to aquatic animals and results in unpleasant smells (see the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment journal study here)
COPHENOL SOLUTIONCophenol wants to prevent the damage caused by the coffee waste by creating a biorefinery near to the coffee plantations. The Cophenol solution will convert the coffee pulp into valuable chemicals products that can be used to make paper, plastic and biochar. The biochar is a type of natural fertilizer that we will to give to the coffee producer with no charge to enhance soil fertility and agricultural productivity. Inside a circular economy model, we see in the coffee waste an opportunity to implement the 5R model (reduce, recycle, replace, return, reuse) involving the local community on it.WHERE ARE WE NOW ?The results of our first experiments of the chemical process with the coffee waste as well as a preliminary study market encouraged us to continue forward the project.The idea is to start in Brazil, in the states of Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo, due to the important coffee production and also due to the Brazilian scenario of competitiveness and market strategy.Currently, the Cophenol team is in Brazil to meet with important stakeholders to succeed with Cophenol’s project: coffee producers, coffee cooperatives, local environmental and business organisation, coffee research centers and universities.NOW OUR TEAMCophenol was born in 2014 inside a multicultural, multidisciplinary and very motivated team. From left to rightEmmanuel Thiéry (25 years old): is french and he has a neuroscience master's degree and a bachelor of physic and chemistry bachelor degree. He was been working inside our chemical process with Anna Suchy and is working our business, marketing and financial strategy. He has been leading the Cophenol project in some important competitions that help us financially and encourage us to continue the project.Anna Suchy (25 years old): is a polish PhD student in theAberystwyth University, in Wales (UK).

When a tree dies from a nearby gas leak, the tax-payers –rather than the utility–pay to remove the tree and plant a new one (which of course dies too). The municipality and nearby residents rarely suspect what is going wrong. </li>
<li>
<b>Natural gas (or methane)
     is a powerful greenhouse gas</b> 34
     times more destructive than C0<sub>2</sub>. The amount of natural gas being wasted through leaks in Cambridge and Somerville alone is equivalent to the annual emissions of over 10,000 passenger cars.</li>

<b>Pinpoint the very worst leaks</b> and organize local residents to call these  leaks into the local utility once a day (so long as they still smell gas in the area)<span>.  </span>By law, the utility has to arrive at the site of a reported leak within one hour and is fined heavily if the average
     response time rises over 30 minutes. Even if the utility finds a large leak, it doesn't have to fix it unless the utility believes it's potentially explosive. By calling in the worst leaks once a day, we will make it cheaper for the utility to fix these leaks rather than just keep responding. (Oct. - Nov.)</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""></span>

</p><h3>The Impact</h3><p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Fix 10 of the worst leaks</b> to save an expected $44,500 per year and the carbon emission equivalent of taking 500 passenger cars off the road for a year. </li>
<li>
<b>Map, label and publicize at least 10 trees being killed</b> by the leaks.  The clear visual proof of the damage, along with the estimated cost of the total damage to trees in both cities will help persuade both the residents and the municipalities this problem needs to be fixed.</li>

</div></div>","Natural Gas LeaksNatural gas (aka methane) is pumped to our homes through pipes under the ground.In NSTAR's territory, 17% of these pipes are over 60 years old and made of cast iron.  (And what happens to 60-year-old iron that's stuck in the damp earth?)These pipes rust and corrode, leaking natural gas first into the soil, and from there into the atmosphere. 
These leaks are bad because: 


They are potentially
     explosive.  12 people were hurt in Dorchester when
     a house exploded on April 17th.  7 people died in Harlem on March 12th. 

They kill trees by
     suffocating their roots. The City of Brookline estimates the damage to its city trees at over $1 million.  Both Cambridge
     and Somerville are likely to have as much tree damage as Brookline. When a tree dies from a nearby gas leak, the tax-payers –rather than the utility–pay to remove the tree and plant a new one (which of course dies too). The municipality and nearby residents rarely suspect what is going wrong. 

Natural gas (or methane)
     is a powerful greenhouse gas 34
     times more destructive than C02. The amount of natural gas being wasted through leaks in Cambridge and Somerville alone is equivalent to the annual emissions of over 10,000 passenger cars.

The utilities pass the
     cost of this waste onto everyone who pays for gas by factoring the lost gas into the price of the gas
     delivered. Conservation Law Foundation estimates the cost at $38 million per year in Massachusetts alone.  
Fixing the average leak, according to State Rep. Ehrlich, would recoup its cost through saved gas in under three years.  Leaks that are not considered potentially explosive never have to be repaired and so could be leaking wasted gas for decades.

The Plan
This summer, we will drive down every street in Cambridge and Somerville with a
high-precision methane analyzer. 
We
will:


Post the maps of the leaks so residents and the cities can work to address the issue. (Oct.)


Pinpoint the very worst leaks and organize local residents to call these  leaks into the local utility once a day (so long as they still smell gas in the area).  By law, the utility has to arrive at the site of a reported leak within one hour and is fined heavily if the average
     response time rises over 30 minutes. Even if the utility finds a large leak, it doesn't have to fix it unless the utility believes it's potentially explosive. By calling in the worst leaks once a day, we will make it cheaper for the utility to fix these leaks rather than just keep responding. (Oct. - Nov.)


Create a national website where any community can post a map of their leaks and organize citizens to call those leaks in
until they are fixed. There are technical assistance grants offered by the government that can help a community pay for the cost of mapping their leaks. (March, 2015)



The Impact


Fix 10 of the worst leaks to save an expected $44,500 per year and the carbon emission equivalent of taking 500 passenger cars off the road for a year. 

Map, label and publicize at least 10 trees being killed by the leaks.  The clear visual proof of the damage, along with the estimated cost of the total damage to trees in both cities will help persuade both the residents and the municipalities this problem needs to be fixed.

Share the map of the leaks with Somerville and Cambridge so the cities can work effectively with the utilities.

Create a national website that allows local groups to find and fix the worst leaks in their communities.

<p> </p></div>","What is the project about?
Near the most Southerly point of Spain lies the basin of what once used to be the biggest wetland area in the Iberian Peninsula. The rivers that fed this laguna have been dammed, diverted and canalized to create agricultural land. This is considered to be one of the biggest ecological disasters of Spain as it has destroyed vast areas of habitat for the thousands of migrating birds that pass through the area every year. 
         
In the past six months we have been exploring the underlying energy structure of this area. Geomancy is the art of tapping into the subtle layers of the land, connecting to the Essence and Spirit of the place. 
We now wish to invite artists who are interested in 
this type of work for a five day Earth healing event 
in October, to explore and express the story of the 
place, and inspire it with a new movement and 
flow. We intend to do that through site specific 
performance art, photography, installation in the 
landscape and storytelling that arises from the 
energy work we will do together in the dried up 
basin. 
This event will take place during the height of the Autumn migration period of birds back to Africa, allowing us to interact and witness the awesome association of the place with the Spirit of Birds.
 
 
Who we are?
Karmit, Stephen and Sophie have been preparing the the groundwork for this Earth healing event in October. For the past six months we have been working geomantically in the basin of the wetlands with a group of dedicated people. Please read about us and below you can read some of the profiles of the people who are joining our team in October.  
My name is Karmit EvenZur. I am a geomancer and shamanic practitioner. My work is about collaboration with the archetypal and creative forces of Nature as a form of environmental activism, personal growth and human development. www.inlove.org.uk
Stephen Knapp - Stephen is a passionate birder, ecologist and advocate of nature spirituality. For the past seven years Stephen has been immersed in the bird life of the area, particularly in and around the La Janda wetlands. Stephen worked for 25 years as a Nature Reserve Warden in the UK and as co-founder and Project Director for a nature reserve in the Atlantic Rainforest of south east Brazil. www.andaluciabirdtours.com
 Sophie Twiss - Artist, printmaker, Earth inspired dreamer. Sophie explores with vision and imagination the subtle layers of our world. ‘Working in La Janda has brought me a movement in my personal and creative processes, it is an area that resonates with my soul. Connecting to a landscape allows a learning from the earth, her passage through time, the vastness and richness of human experience.’ www.stwiss.net

  
 
How you can help?
From our geomantic explorations so far we see that the place calls for concious interaction, and responds to the openness we bring to it.  We wish to bring people, energy and movement to the place where the flow of water has been dammed, canalised and diverted to restore the balance. 
Between the 8th - 12th of October 2012 we will be holding an Earth healing event in the basin of the laguna. During these 5 days we will work geomantically, birdwatch and engage in creative expression that arises individually and collectively in our group. 
We are asking for your help to:
Provide financial support to offset the 450$ costs per participant. These funds cover tuition, housing, meals, and local transportation for the duration of the program. 
Any additional funds we raise will go towards the exhibition of artwork produced, which will take place at the beginning of 2013. 
The event is open to participants from all over the world. 
 
 

Why is this project important to us and to the area? 
Our two main objectives are:
 1. To bring about balance and healing on an energetic level to an ecosystem that has been deeply scarred. We do this by developing our capacity to listen to the story of the place and working with the archetypal creative forces of Nature.
2. To prepare a body of artwork that reflects this healing process and can serve to raise public awareness for the important and sacred aspect of the wetlands.
         
           This creative and spiritual approach to 
environmental activism can serve as an interesting 
                      model for other projects.

<p>The Walk is an initiative by 13 year old Rachel to create awareness about our Right to Know what’s in our food.  Scientists and Doctors have warned that genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in our food pose irreversible long term risks to our health and the environment.  The Walk will take place at <strong>10 am on Saturday, Nov. 3<sup>rd</sup> from Dundas Square (33 Dundas St. E.) to St. Lawrence Market (95 Front St.)</strong></p>
<p>Please join Rachel, Kids and Parents welcome!</p>

<p><strong>Goal</strong> </p>
<p>To raise funds to cover the costs of coordinating the Kids Right to Know Walk in support of California’s Proposition 37 to label GMO foods and to increase awareness (particularly children) about the dangers of unlabeled genetically modified foods (GMOs) that unsuspecting parents are feeding their families every day.  Foods from companies such as Kellogg’s, Kraft, Sara Lee, McCains, Nestle, and Frito-Lay, just to name a few.</p>

<p>Rachel has devoted years now to writing and speaking about GMO’S (see YouTube).  She believes that the planet is facing a real crisis!  Monsanto, by creating GMOs is trying to re-invent nature, with the potential to completely devastate our entire eco system.  She’s worried that her future won’t include any natural foods.  She’s also worried about the health risks GMOs pose, including allergies, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, autism, cancer, and reproductive disorders to name a few.  This has motivated her to speak and educate kids and families in Canada.  Her hope is that a well informed public will pressure the government, the media, and the multinational food manufacturers to do the right thing by labeling GMO foods, giving consumers the right to choose.  Hopefully, this will lead to consumer rejection of these products, and ultimately the complete elimination of GMOs, before it’s too late!</p>

<p><strong>THE BOUNDLESS BALI EXPERIENCE</strong></p>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>My name is Fatsuma. I am a student in my last year of college and ready to conquer the world! I have always had a passion for music and have recently discovered I want to continue this passion by becoming a record producer. But there is another passion I have as well.</p>
<p>I have recently applied, and have been accepted to, a unique opportunity to go on a journey called the Boundless Bali Experience. This journey is designed to help people fully open themselves, discover who they are, and become the leaders the truly strive to be. This experience is not a vacation, or a retreat, rather it is a journey to help me become the leader and become the wholehearted person I am striving to become, with Bali as my classroom.</p>
<p>I have been exploring a more spiritual path for many months now and I have opened and changed my perspective on many things in life itself.  Through this journey I have been realizing many things.  This world we live in needs help, a lot of HELP.  We are all going after something to make us feel better, whole, accepted, loved, etc. and we don't even realize it.  We fight, hurt, steal, kill, backstab just to get ahead of the game or make it in the world, or just get our boss to notice us so we can get a promotion because we don't have enough. We are hurting each other in so many ways that we have lost sight of who we are, which is <strong>ONE</strong>.</p>
<p>We are all the same, we are all connected. When someone hurts, we can feel the pain, when someone laughs, we light up a little. I believe order to help the world in any way we can, we also have to help ourselves.  As we begin to realize this, and make changes that can positively affect ourselves, we are ultimately positively affecting the world.</p>
<p>It may seem illogical that helping the world through yourself is possible, it may even seem selfish, but stay with me here.  How do you expect to help a friend who is depressed, or upset about something when you yourself are depressed? How can you help the environment become greater and help the healing of mankind when you don't take action or are consumed with bitter or resentful feelings towards someone?</p>
<p>I believe that since we are all connected in some way, as we each improve for the better,  not materialistically or financially, but wholeheartedly, becoming our true selves, with the basis being GIVING, we in effect, help the world become better as well.</p>
<p><strong>THIS IS WHAT MY OTHER PASSION IS AND THIS IS WHY I AM DOING THIS FUNDRAISER</strong></p>
<p><strong>This journey helps people become the leaders that can help change the world.</strong></p>
<p> I am truly honored and blessed to have been accepted and have felt the calling want to go on this journey. This journey is created to better those who embark it and become the best they can be I want to help this world. This is what this journey is about. It is an 11 1/2 day<strong> transformational, experiential, immersion journey </strong>to Bali were <strong>21</strong> people from around the  <strong>WORLD,</strong> yes, <strong>THE WORLD</strong>, who believe that<br/>there is more than this chaos, <strong>that there is a way to contribute to this world in some way, can learn and find out how they themselves can become fully whole hearted and giving so they can become leaders and help the world in some way</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I want to help this world. I don't know how; maybe it will be through my music, or another means, but I know this journey will help me transform into the being that can make a positive impact and contribution to this world.</p>
<p>I ask anyone who reads this to please help me with reaching this goal in this fundraiser<strong>. I am looking for support for this journey and anyone who is able to support me! You can donate whatever amount you have</strong>. Your single act of giving will also not only bring positive effects to me, but yourself and the world. <strong>The slightest act helps, its baby steps that can make  a movement.</strong></p>
<p>If you cannot contribute anything, and if you have any other ideas for help I am more than welcome to accept those as well.  I will truly appreciate any help. If you can pass this on I would be even more grateful as well.  I would really love the support from anyone! Thank you!</p>

<h3><strong>Match a grassroots movement to fight climate change.</strong></h3>
<p>Every spring, Canadian tree planters prove that there is hope in the face of climate change.</p>
<p>Not just by planting trees, as important as that is, but by acting in solidarity with people halfway around the world who struggle with climate change every day. </p>

<p>In partnership with Community Forests International (Forests Intl.), hardworking young Canadians are raising funds for Pemba - a threatened island off the coast of East Africa.</p>
<p>Pemban communities are fighting climate change by restoring their forests and so much more. Canadian tree planters are giving their hard-earned wages to support this hopeful mission and we are asking you to match their generosity.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495645173/t491d0glx7nleixqrt72.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Supporting people directly affected by climate change to take bold action is one of the most important things that we can do to help.</strong> </p>
<p>Please consider joining this effort by giving a portion of your day's earnings to Pemba and help us grow our impact!</p>

Forests Intl. worked hard to secure a partnership with the <a href=""http://www.gcca.eu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Global Climate Change Alliance</a> that effectively quadruples all funds raised for Pemba. Now we need your support to maximize this great opportunity.<br/> </p>

<p>Forests Intl. fights climate change by empowering rural communities to thrive with nature.

<h3>Mangrove Forests</h3>

<p><strong>Working with nature to build resilience to climate change.</strong></p>
<p>Mangove forests hug Pemba’s coastline, surrounding the island with a “bioshield” of trees that live half on the land and half in the sea. Their strong interlocking roots hold soils in place against waves and flooding and provide important habitat for fish and other wildlife.<br/><br/>Mangrove forests are a nature's defense against rising seas but are threatened globally. This year, Forests Intl. will launch a mangrove restoration program in Pemba and <strong>work alongside five coastal communities to replant and conserve mangroves in areas affected by illegal cutting.</strong></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Spice Forests</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495641873/ckx6ji5nwbdtrqezarjp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Can we have our conservation and eat it too?</strong></p>
<p>Our team helps farmers innovate by combining spice growing with forest restoration. A ""spice forest"" is a jungle of trees and vines all producing edible spices – things like cinnamon, black pepper, cloves, and cardamom – in a way that is both profitable and resilient to climate change.<br/><br/>The spice forest program is quickly growing and now involves over 100 farmers! This year we will help farmers expand and market their produce by <strong>establishing a fairtrade cooperative and building an R &amp; D nursery </strong>to grow special trees and new spice varieties<strong>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Empowered communities are the restorative force that world needs.</strong><br/><br/>Forests Intl. has transferred over 100 hectares of land to community ownership to date. This land security is crucial for rural communities – empowering them to make long-term decisions about how their land and forests are managed and protected.</p>
<p>This year, Forests Intl. will <strong>help six new Pemban communities gain legal title to their community land </strong>and support investments in climate change resilience efforts like forest protection and restoration.</p>

<p>Community Forests International was founded in 2008 by four young Canadian tree-planters.</p>
<p>We believe that people around the world can innovate their own solutions to some of the toughest challenges. And when we find a solution that really works, we are committed to giving communities the tools and training they need to get it off the ground.  Together we change the world<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Forests Intl. is a registered charity and all donations of $25 or more will receive a charitable receipt.</strong></p>

Check out our fundraising thermometer below to see how your donation helps us reach our BIG goal!

Match a grassroots movement to fight climate change.
Every spring, Canadian tree planters prove that there is hope in the face of climate change.
Not just by planting trees, as important as that is, but by acting in solidarity with people halfway around the world who struggle with climate change every day. 

In partnership with Community Forests International (Forests Intl.), hardworking young Canadians are raising funds for Pemba - a threatened island off the coast of East Africa.
Pemban communities are fighting climate change by restoring their forests and so much more. Canadian tree planters are giving their hard-earned wages to support this hopeful mission and we are asking you to match their generosity.

Supporting people directly affected by climate change to take bold action is one of the most important things that we can do to help. 
Please consider joining this effort by giving a portion of your day's earnings to Pemba and help us grow our impact!
 

Every dollar raised goes to Pemba, times four!
Every dollar raised goes directly to Pemba. Campaign partners Brinkman and Associates Reforestation have generously covered the overhead costs for this fundraiser so 100% of your donation supports on the ground work in Pemba.

AND every dollar raised is multiplied by four. Forests Intl. worked hard to secure a partnership with the Global Climate Change Alliance that effectively quadruples all funds raised for Pemba. Now we need your support to maximize this great opportunity. 
Our shared challenge.
Climate change affects us all, just not all equally. Finding common ground, matching one good act with another, and sharing in the hard work of positive change is how we build a more hopeful future. Please join us!

Changes in rainfall, sea level rise, and warming are negatively impacting Pemba Island.
 
Your donation supports innovation.

Forests Intl. fights climate change by empowering rural communities to thrive with nature. Funds from this campaign will help Pemban communities pursue forest innovations including mangrove restoration, spice forests, community land rights, and more.
 
Mangrove Forests

Working with nature to build resilience to climate change.
Mangove forests hug Pemba’s coastline, surrounding the island with a “bioshield” of trees that live half on the land and half in the sea. Their strong interlocking roots hold soils in place against waves and flooding and provide important habitat for fish and other wildlife.Mangrove forests are a nature's defense against rising seas but are threatened globally. This year, Forests Intl. will launch a mangrove restoration program in Pemba and work alongside five coastal communities to replant and conserve mangroves in areas affected by illegal cutting.
 
Spice Forests

Can we have our conservation and eat it too?
Our team helps farmers innovate by combining spice growing with forest restoration. A ""spice forest"" is a jungle of trees and vines all producing edible spices – things like cinnamon, black pepper, cloves, and cardamom – in a way that is both profitable and resilient to climate change.The spice forest program is quickly growing and now involves over 100 farmers! This year we will help farmers expand and market their produce by establishing a fairtrade cooperative and building an R & D nursery to grow special trees and new spice varieties.
 
Community Forests

Empowered communities are the restorative force that world needs.Forests Intl. has transferred over 100 hectares of land to community ownership to date. This land security is crucial for rural communities – empowering them to make long-term decisions about how their land and forests are managed and protected.
This year, Forests Intl. will help six new Pemban communities gain legal title to their community land and support investments in climate change resilience efforts like forest protection and restoration.
 
Forests Intl.'s tree planting roots.


Community Forests International was founded in 2008 by four young Canadian tree-planters.
We believe that people around the world can innovate their own solutions to some of the toughest challenges. And when we find a solution that really works, we are committed to giving communities the tools and training they need to get it off the ground.  Together we change the world.
Forests Intl. is a registered charity and all donations of $25 or more will receive a charitable receipt.
For more on Forests Intl. and the communities we work with visit  www.forestsinternational.org and follow us on Facebook.
 
Thank you!

A big thanks to all the tree planters that make our work possible, and to Brinkman & Associates Reforestation for covering the costs associated with this fundraiser. Tuko pamoja - we are together.",12.0,0,"6 Campaigns

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>In 2015, PawsLikeMe helped over two million people connect
with adoptable dogs using the first ever human-to-pet matching algorithm. In
2016, we need your support to finalize the algorithm that will allow us to match
deserving felines nationwide to the families that need them most.</p>

<h3>What is PawsLikeMe pet matching?</h3>
<span style='font-size: 11.0pt;line-height: 107%;font-family: ""Calibri"",sans-serif;color: #5A5A5A;letter-spacing: .75pt;'>PawsLikeMe uses a short and easy
personality quiz to match people with adoptable dogs from shelters and rescue
groups across the country. The quiz is powered by a scientifically proven
matching algorithm that we developed which assesses and scores a person’s
lifestyle, environment and preferences as they pertain to dog ownership.

<span style='font-size: 11.0pt;line-height: 107%;font-family: ""Calibri"",sans-serif;color: #5A5A5A;letter-spacing: .75pt;'>We identified four core personality quadrants
which closely influence the human and canine bond: Energy, Focus, Independence

New off-road motorcycles will greatly help them to do their jobs.

New off-road motorcycles will greatly help them to do their jobs. And the Mongolian government has agreed to provide all maintenance, parts and fuel for the motorcycles.I am raising funds to buy one motorcycle and safety gear to outfit a ranger.  On my own dime I am going to go to Mongolia to deliver it to the ranger in person. Entire airfare comes out of my own pocket, and I am volunteering my time both here with fundraising and coordination, and in Mongolia with coordination and delivery.Lake Hovsgol is one of the last best places!The Lake and surrounding wildlife area is a National Park bigger than Yellowstone and strictly protected as a transition zone between Central Asian Steppe and the Siberian Taiga.  It's one of 17 ancient lakes that are more than 2 million years old, and the water is so clean you can drink it without any treatment.  There are a number of indigenous people that live around it and depend on it for their water supply.  In fact  it contains 70% of all the surface freshwater supply for the whole country of Mongolia.  There is no body of water this clean and this large in America.

<h2>My Story</h2>

<p>Hey everyone! My name is Danny Clark and I'm really into human health and ecology (ie, nature). I studied biology/archaeology in school, yet I've always been more of a big picture philosophical type than a typical scientist. Integration is more my jam than studying little pieces of things (both are needed, of course!). Thus, this project - which is about studying the connection between us and our environment, via movement, food systems, and sensory development - is really the ""lab"" I've decided to work in.</p>
<p>A little more about me (feel free to skip ahead):</p>
<p>I grew up in suburban New Jersey (know to some as the ""armpit"" of America). There was a small patch of marshy woods near the house where I grew up.  My dad took me fishing occasionally, and we vacationed in the Poconos. There's really no logical explanation for why Im so incredibly passionate about all this nature stuff. None of my friends or family are. Yet, for some reason I am.  Big time. Its an inner itch of curiosity that's always been there, and drives me relentlessly down a fairly untrodden path.  Its a trail that ultimately lead me to <a href=""http://www.movnat.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MovNat </a>(an education system that connects people to natural patterns of movement) and Permaculture (the study of nature's patterns to inform human habitation and technology). See my mentor <a href=""http://wholesystemsdesign.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ben Falk's site</a> for more info on Permaculture (and Ben will be a big part of the project!).</p>
<p>Recently, I found myself hitting a wall. As I continued my studies and did my best to apply them to my life, I knew I had to take it to the next level. Further, while I knew that my own small actions/choices do have an impact on the world, I tend to think big. These pursuits aren't just about me, after all....if nature teaches us one thing, its that everything is inextricably connected; that we're all in this together.  Thus, the vision of this project was born...</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>The Vision</h2>
<p>What does nature have to offer humans beyond the feel-good, stress combating ""beauty"" we all recognize and raw materials for civilization?</p>
<p>And, if one were so inclined, why is it so friggin' hard to actually make living close/deeply connected to nature happen?</p>
<p>These were the base questions that drove me to make a truly scary, yet exciting decision: to buy 30 acres in rural Vermont with little financial resources and virtually zero building experience.  What I did have was a willingness to be very uncomfortable, plus a knowledgeable mentor (Ben Falk of Whole Systems Design, who is playing an active part in this project).</p>
<p>As I considered making the property purchase, I thought back to those two questions.  I visualized that if the answers were thoroughly explored and resources were developed to help others with little to zero experience do the same (to any even small degree), the world would change in some meaningful way.</p>
<p>Then, I pulled the trigger, and set out make that vision become reality.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>There are a few ways to contribute to this project, and all of them are much appreciated:</p>
<p>- Show up, move with us, and get some hands-on learning (more about that below) - included are daily lessons in movement ergonomics and restoration practices.</p>
<p>- Pitch in a few bucks </p>
<p>- Help expose the ideas - whether it be this particular project, MovNat, or Permaculture</p>
<p>- Start your own practice (which hands-on learning will expedite, guaranteed) </p>
<p>Here's what you are contributing to:</p>
<p>- The creation of small house (640 sq feet) so I can live on the property year round without freezing my arse off in the harsh Vermont climate</p>
<p>- Infrastructure for guests (water, driveway, waste, tent/movement platforms, shower, and food systems)</p>
<p>- The greater vision, which includes my prototype Permaculture site development and eventual not-for-profit initiatives for helping others do the same (Permaculture isn't just about moving out to the ""sticks"" - it can be done anywhere)</p>
<p>- The greater greater vision, which is for human thought to mature and understand/integrate the spiritual richness and economic value of fitting better into the world that we inhabit.</p>
<p>My track record is full of accomplishing the things I set out to do - with the collaborative effort and input of many - so there's no question all of the above will happen!</p>

<h2>The Cabin Build</h2>

<p>Here's the specs on the cabin:</p>
<p>- 32' x 20' footprint w/ lofted second floor. Passive solar orientation</p>
<p>- The foundation will be a rubble trench</p>
<p>- The exterior walls will be done using slipform stone masonry, a beginner friendly and cheap (yet little known) construction technique</p>
<p>- The interior walls will be a wood lathe, covered in clay plaster</p>
<p>- The first floor will be Earthen (clay) with hydronic heat inlay</p>
<p>- The second floor and roof structure will be made using traditional timber framing (tenon and mortise joinery)</p>
<p>- The power will be 100% supplied by solar photovoltaic panels (this property is ""off grid"")</p>
<p>- The water source will be a spring (already dug) to cistern gravity flow system</p>
<p>- The heat source (beyond the passive solar design) will be a custom made wood stove that burns wood and also heats domestic water and under floor radiant system</p>
<p>- The septic will likely be a composting toilet, though a conventional septic will be dug to fulfill requirement by the state of Vermont.</p>
<p>*A separate campaign of the same nature will be initiated next year for the food systems (and ecosystem creation) part of the project.</p>

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>The Obstacles</h2>
<p><strong>1) Human power</strong></p>
<p>The whole land ownership thing has never sat well with me.  Right away, we create our own barriers, and amplify our own hardships. I want people, animals, and life in general moving freely (and relaxing) on my ""property."" And, that's a big theme of this project - moving beyond our own personal fitness space, our delusions of ""self,"" and actually doing something helpful with our movement.</p>
<p>Long story short: I need some helping hands. Not because Im too cheap to pay some teenagers or big machines to do the work with me. Rather, we need to revive a culture of movement, hands-on learning, and connection. It starts here and will not end here. That's a pledge.</p>
<p><strong>2) Finances</strong></p>
<p>Even if I had the financial power, I wouldn't want to ""muscle"" this project forward just by throwing money at it.  Yet, money is just a modern reality...I envision it as the gas the fuels the vehicle.  Just one vital component of making forward progress.</p>
<p>So, money is a limiting factor.  Frankly, I have no idea how Im going to afford everything.  I'm shooting at the hip on that front. Not really though - if you are interested in the financial/budgeting aspect of the project, just email me.  Or I can post about it in an ""update""</p>
<p><strong>3) Timeline</strong></p>
<p>Vermont has a very short season that is amicable to getting things done.  Hence, obstacles 1 &amp; 2 are much more necessary compared to many other bioregions.</p>
<p><b>4) Work</b></p>
<p>I have a full-time job, running and teaching for MovNat. Luckily, I work from home and my travel schedule is light for the late summer/early Fall. My time dedicated toward this project is limited though - which is good news for participants who want to enjoy swimming, exploring, and relaxing in this beautiful place! </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>Get Involved and Spread the Word</h2>
<p>Ok, here's the nuts and bolts of how to get involved:</p>
<p>- Come pitch in during various phases of the project </p>
<p>- Make a donation on this page</p>
<p>- Share this page</p>
<p>- Email me with questions</p>
<p><strong><i>If you want to pitch in, here's the current opportunities:</i></strong></p>
<p>- July 26-27: Stone Gathering / Form Building</p>
<p>- August 3-Sept 26: Slipform Stone Wall construction</p>
<p>- Sept 27-29: Workshop with Matt Eddy on Traditional Timber Framing, plus roof raising (a $100/day fee (or $249 for all 3 days) to cover Matt's expenses and expertise will be required for this workshop...more details soon).</p>
<p>- Sept 30 - Nov 1: Earthen floor, clay walls, misc finishing details</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>I recommend you stay for at least 2-3 nights to settle in and really enjoy the experience. Kids are welcome. More opportunities will likely be available for later phases of the project. See FAQ for more or email me.</p>

This research site is located in the beautiful White River Valley (exceptional swimming will be happening on the reg) in the foothills of the Green Mountains.  The site is about 3 miles from Rochester, Vermont up 1.25 miles a town maintained dirt road.  Four wheel drive not required.

 

The Obstacles
1) Human power
The whole land ownership thing has never sat well with me.  Right away, we create our own barriers, and amplify our own hardships. I want people, animals, and life in general moving freely (and relaxing) on my ""property."" And, that's a big theme of this project - moving beyond our own personal fitness space, our delusions of ""self,"" and actually doing something helpful with our movement.
Long story short: I need some helping hands. Not because Im too cheap to pay some teenagers or big machines to do the work with me. Rather, we need to revive a culture of movement, hands-on learning, and connection. It starts here and will not end here. That's a pledge.
2) Finances
Even if I had the financial power, I wouldn't want to ""muscle"" this project forward just by throwing money at it.  Yet, money is just a modern reality...I envision it as the gas the fuels the vehicle.  Just one vital component of making forward progress.
So, money is a limiting factor.  Frankly, I have no idea how Im going to afford everything.  I'm shooting at the hip on that front. Not really though - if you are interested in the financial/budgeting aspect of the project, just email me.  Or I can post about it in an ""update""
3) Timeline
Vermont has a very short season that is amicable to getting things done.  Hence, obstacles 1 & 2 are much more necessary compared to many other bioregions.
4) Work
I have a full-time job, running and teaching for MovNat. Luckily, I work from home and my travel schedule is light for the late summer/early Fall. My time dedicated toward this project is limited though - which is good news for participants who want to enjoy swimming, exploring, and relaxing in this beautiful place! 
 

Get Involved and Spread the Word
Ok, here's the nuts and bolts of how to get involved:
- Come pitch in during various phases of the project 
- Make a donation on this page
- Share this page
- Email me with questions
If you want to pitch in, here's the current opportunities:
- July 26-27: Stone Gathering / Form Building
- August 3-Sept 26: Slipform Stone Wall construction
- Sept 27-29: Workshop with Matt Eddy on Traditional Timber Framing, plus roof raising (a $100/day fee (or $249 for all 3 days) to cover Matt's expenses and expertise will be required for this workshop...more details soon).
- Sept 30 - Nov 1: Earthen floor, clay walls, misc finishing details
--
I recommend you stay for at least 2-3 nights to settle in and really enjoy the experience. Kids are welcome. More opportunities will likely be available for later phases of the project. See FAQ for more or email me.
 
How to get involved: email me at drc5n@virginia.edu to reserve your timeframe.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><i>Immersion Travel</i> isn't the kind of magazine that features giant resorts on white sandy beaches. You won't catch us sitting on a beach drinking umbrella-topped cocktails.

<p>Last May I received a letter from county weed control stating that a
neighbor had complained about my tall lawn. Ordinances explain that lawns must
be kept at 6"" or shorter, and some patches of my lawn were at or just
above that length (taller lawns have deeper roots and conserve more soil
moisture). I vowed that if I ever received such a letter I would finally tear
out most of my front lawn -- a small, wasted space that's never used and fries
in the summer -- replacing it with a sustainable, low maintenance landscape
full of Nebraska native prairie plants that will inspire and educate folks in our city and beyond. I'm full of hope and fear: what will
the neighbors think? Can I be one of the few local examples of a professionally
designed, aesthetically pleasing, wildlife supporting front yard in a time of shrinking bee and butterfly numbers? Will I get
another letter in the mail? Will you come visit us when we're done?<br/></p>
<p>I'm Benjamin Vogt, part time English teacher by day, and by night owner of <a href=""http://monarchgard.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Monarch Gardens</a>,
a prairie garden consulting and design business. Over the years I've visited
dozens of homes, acreages, and school landscapes. While working with clients
it's become clear that there are few to no home gardens that feature native
plants, and even fewer that feature them in an artfully designed way; this fact
means that a homeowner wishing to create a more sustainable garden has little
to draw inspiration from. Well, I'm willing to be the guinea pig.
Remaking my front yard will help me teach clients, my neighborhood, and the
city of Lincoln, all while combating the myth that native plants are weedy. <b>I'll host tours and workshops and use this transformation in talks and articles.</b> My <a href=""http://deepmiddle.blogspot.com/p/my-garden.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">1,500'

landscapes (500-1,000 square feet), and using drought tolerant native plants in
a site-specific design, I will create a stunning display showing off
landscaping practices that should be the norm in the 21st century. In addition,

</div></div>","Last May I received a letter from county weed control stating that a
neighbor had complained about my tall lawn. Ordinances explain that lawns must
be kept at 6"" or shorter, and some patches of my lawn were at or just
above that length (taller lawns have deeper roots and conserve more soil
moisture). I vowed that if I ever received such a letter I would finally tear
out most of my front lawn -- a small, wasted space that's never used and fries
in the summer -- replacing it with a sustainable, low maintenance landscape
full of Nebraska native prairie plants that will inspire and educate folks in our city and beyond. I'm full of hope and fear: what will
the neighbors think? Can I be one of the few local examples of a professionally
designed, aesthetically pleasing, wildlife supporting front yard in a time of shrinking bee and butterfly numbers? Will I get
another letter in the mail? Will you come visit us when we're done?
I'm Benjamin Vogt, part time English teacher by day, and by night owner of Monarch Gardens,
a prairie garden consulting and design business. Over the years I've visited
dozens of homes, acreages, and school landscapes. While working with clients
it's become clear that there are few to no home gardens that feature native
plants, and even fewer that feature them in an artfully designed way; this fact
means that a homeowner wishing to create a more sustainable garden has little
to draw inspiration from. Well, I'm willing to be the guinea pig.
Remaking my front yard will help me teach clients, my neighborhood, and the
city of Lincoln, all while combating the myth that native plants are weedy. I'll host tours and workshops and use this transformation in talks and articles. My 1,500'
backyard garden (75% natives) was named a 2012 top outdoor space by
Apartment Therapy, has appeared on two public tours, and has been featured online at Fine Gardening and Garden Design. I also
contributed plant picks to the how-to book Lawn Gone!, write a weekly design and wildlife garden column at Houzz (my pieces have received over 1
million views), and run the pollinator-supporting Facebook page MILK the WEED.

level should be below 500 ppm. Resultantly, the areas adjoining Chinnalapatti

<p>•
The public launch of the project is scheduled for Mahatma Gandhi's birthday,
<b>October 2, 2014</b> by Dhan Foundation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>• Educational Community Building / Public Awareness Workshops:</p><p><b>January 2015 - April 2015</b></p>
<p>• Vaigai River Restoration Pageant Event: <b>April 2015</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""color: #8CC63F;""><b>STRATEGY: Raise Awareness, Mobilize Action &amp;
Implement Solutions</b></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>One of the first steps to
restoring the Vaigai River is building a collaborative partnership of
stakeholders</b>, including environmental organizations, schools, universities,
farming groups, activists, government representatives, cultural
institutions, artisans, performers, and the people of Madurai, who
will be mobilized and work together to positively impact the future of the
Vaigai River. Through the innovative and creative strategy, we will
engage community participants in a grassroots educational and social
action campaign. The community will help identify the issues, raise public
awareness, and participate in direct action and implementation of
solutions. </p>
<p><b>Actions Already Underway since April 2014: </b></p>
<p>• <b>Stakeholders Meetings</b> in Madurai being organized by the DHAN Foundation</p>
<p>• <b>Building partnerships and collaborations</b> for the workshops and pageant
with numerous schools and organizations including TheThiagarajar
College of Engineering and The World Storytelling Institute in Chennai. The
group of partner organizations and community participants is growing every day,
along with our global support network from New York, California, Delhi, Mumbai,
Chennai, Madurai, and beyond.</p>
<p>• <b>Enlisting artisans</b> of folk art and performing
traditions from clay sculpture, paper mache, handloom weavers, Sungadi sari
makers, artisans utilizing traditional organic vegetable dye techniques,
painters, kavadi headdress builders, as well as performers of music, dance,
theater, poetry, storytelling, and ceremony. </p>
<p>• <b>Gathering key environmental educators</b> to work
alongside the artisans for the educational workshops.</p>

<p><b><span style=""color: #8CC63F;""><strong>Educational Community-Building Workshops: January — April 2015:</strong></span></b></p><p><b>Free workshops will be conducted by the artists-in-residence/workshop instructors in collaboration with environmental educators</b> to engage community members and students, educating the participants
on the issues of the Vaigai River and solutions to be implemented. <a href=""http://www.asiainitiatives.org/soccs/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Asia
Initiatives</a> will bring in their unique system of Social Capital Credits
(SoCCs) as a way to incentivize the community to attend the workshops and
contribute towards the river restoration. The work created in the workshops will
raise awareness for specific issues and will be presented in the Pageant.</p>
<p><b>The workshop series engages
youth and adults for 3 months to:</b></p>
<p><span>•  </span><b>Explore
the diversity of plant and animal life</b> as indicators of the river’s
health, as well as discuss current issues concerning pollution and waste through
a ‘place-based’ learning process.</p>
<p>•<span>  </span><b>Work with artists-in-residence</b> to create spectacular
visual arts works such as mobile sculptures/puppets and costumes for the
procession inspired by the species, habitats, issues, and restoration efforts
of the river.</p>
<p>•<span>  </span><b>Utilize ecologically friendly practices</b> in the
creation of art projects, incorporating the use of recycled, natural and
organic materials.</p>
<p>•<span>  </span><b>Engage local artisans</b> to participate in the project creating visual art projects highlighting their folk art traditions such as: clay sculptures, costumes, handloom textiles, bamboo/paper-maché sculpture, decorative processional staffs, headdresses, masks, face painting,
palanquins/processional sculpture carts, kolam rice/chalk powder drawings,
Sungudi saree and dyeing techniques, that revive traditional vegetables dyes
rather than chemical dyes that pollute the river.</p>
<p>•<span>  </span><b>Social Capital Credits (SoCCs)</b>, a virtual currency for social good, will be used to implement the above processes not only during the workshops, but as a long term practice for sustainable ecological and social development. People will be able to earn SoCCs by helping with the pageant, and river cleaning actions such as waste management, maintaining irrigation channels and water tanks, planting trees etc. They will be able to use the SoCCs thus earned to get services like subsidized electricity, telephone talk time, school scholarships, healthcare, etc. </p>

What is the Vaigai River Restoration Pageant Project?The Vaigai River Restoration Pageant Project is an educational, ecological art project that engages the local community, raises public environmental awareness, and mobilizes direct action and support to restore the water quality, species, habitats and health of India’s famous Vaigai River in the ancient temple city of Madurai, Tamil Nadu, South India. The project raises awareness to mitigate the severe crisis of pollution and contamination of a major natural water resource by waste dumping, toxic chemical pollution, poor water flow, and promotes sustainable solutions for agricultural irrigation, safe drinking water, and restoration plans of this vital natural resource that the community depends on for their survival.Earth Celebrations’ Hudson River Pageant to restore native species, habitats, and address climate change, New York City. Photo by William Bourassa Jr.CREATIVE STRATEGIES: Community Building, Public Awareness, Education, Social Action, and Implementation of SolutionsThrough the innovative and creative strategy and model of the Vaigai River Restoration Pageant Project, we will engage community participants in a grassroots educational and social action campaign. We will utilize community-based art and the theatrical pageant (a procession with site specific performances), an indigenous art-form to mobilize the community to identify the issues, raise public awareness, participate in direct action and implement solutions to mitigate the severe environmental crisis of pollution and contamination of a major natural water resource and to counter the effects of climate change.An educational workshop series builds community engagement and awareness of the Vaigai River for 3 months from January to April, 2015 leading up to the culminating Vaigai River Restoration Pageant. Through the workshops, environmental educators inspire community participants to learn about the river issues and solutions. This work provides the inspiration and a “place-based” learning process that is foundation for the creative ideas for the pageant. Community participants work with local artisans/artists-in-residence to create giant mobile sculptures, puppets, costumes, visual artwork, and performances to highlight the Vaigai River, its history, habitat, water quality, related issues of sanitation and climate change, and future restoration. The workshops are offered free of cost to the community and culminate in the Vaigai River Restoration Pageant in April 2015.The culminating Vaigai River Restoration Pageant includes a procession of giant mobile sculptures, spectacular costumes, and musical bands with site-specific performances of theater, music, storytelling, poetry, and dance by local folk performing groups, organizations, schools, and community participants that highlight the issues and solutions of the Vaigai River. Location / Procession Route: The performances are presented at significant sites along the banks of the Vaigai River from Villangudi to Albert Victor Bridge and the Maiya Mandapam, in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, South India. Image Source: Nabuur.com




MADURAI Madurai, situated on the banks of the Vaigai River, in Tamil Nadu, Southern India, is known as the Temple City of India. Marco Polo called Madurai the most splendid province on Earth. The magnificence of Madurai as a cultural center since the Tamil Era 2,500 years ago, as well as the beauty of the Vaigai River that runs through it, has been celebrated for thousands of years in Indian literature and sacred texts. Here the ancient past exists alongside the modern world, with its people still practicing sacred and ancient traditions rooted in its legendary history. Meenakshi Temple is known for its magnificent Dravidian architecture with gopurams (gateways) completely covered with intricate colorful sculptural images of gods, animals, and mythical creatures. Madurai’s significance as a center for textiles dates back to its ancient past. Madurai is also the place where in 1921 Mahatma Gandhi relinquished his western clothing to wear a loincloth made of khadi (homespun cloth) as an act to align himself with the people, and as an act of social change.GOALS: Community Building, Social Action, & SolutionsThe project plans for the Vaigai River Restoration include the following:• Raising awareness for better waste management practices among communities.• Raising awareness for restoration of water quality, efforts to provide safe drinking water, and  DHAN Foundation’s existing projects such as Vayalagam Tankfed Agriculture Development Program (VTADP).• Building partnerships of stakeholders and engaging city officials, corporations, environmental organizations, activists, farming groups, schools and universities to be mobilized and participate in solutions to restore the river• Engaging community participation in creative ecological art project and pageant performance to bring attention to the river, its history, and efforts to restore the health of the river for drinking water, agriculture, recreation, and peaceful open space within the city • Highlight and initiate proposals for visions for the future of the river such as a river park along the banks of the Vaigai and other recreational uses that promote the care and appreciation of the river, its historical legacy, and future as an ecological oasis within the cityTop: R.

STATEMENTS
OF NEED “Once the preliminary work of clearing garbage is completed, measures will be taken to stop public from letting sewage water into the river. We have invited suggestions from people and activists to keep the river clean.”   - Mayor V.V. Rajan Chellappa of Madurai
“The
major area of pollution falls within the city limit… solid waste, plastic
waste, untreated sewage water from institutions and houses act as the major
pollutants. Only by increasing the water flow of the river, it can be brought
to life again. Mixing of sewage water and dumping of solid waste should also be
stopped to set it right.”   - Professor G
Balaji, Department of Architecture, Thiagarajar College of Engineering
“A
proper vision from all stakeholders will help preserve our rivers.”   - K Kalidas,
President of Osai, an environmental NGO
“Untreated
effluents have raised the pollution level of water. The concentration of total
dissolved solids (TSD) in water here is 3,500 to 4,000 ppm, when the acceptable
level should be below 500 ppm. Resultantly, the areas adjoining Chinnalapatti
are fast becoming barren due to underground pollution. Agriculture is also affected.” - S

PROJECT TIMELINE
•
The public launch of the project is scheduled for Mahatma Gandhi's birthday,
October 2, 2014 by Dhan Foundation.

• Educational Community Building / Public Awareness Workshops:January 2015 - April 2015
• Vaigai River Restoration Pageant Event: April 2015

STRATEGY: Raise Awareness, Mobilize Action &
Implement Solutions

One of the first steps to
restoring the Vaigai River is building a collaborative partnership of
stakeholders, including environmental organizations, schools, universities,
farming groups, activists, government representatives, cultural
institutions, artisans, performers, and the people of Madurai, who
will be mobilized and work together to positively impact the future of the
Vaigai River. Through the innovative and creative strategy, we will
engage community participants in a grassroots educational and social
action campaign. The community will help identify the issues, raise public
awareness, and participate in direct action and implementation of
solutions. 
Actions Already Underway since April 2014: 
• Stakeholders Meetings in Madurai being organized by the DHAN Foundation
• Building partnerships and collaborations for the workshops and pageant
with numerous schools and organizations including TheThiagarajar
College of Engineering and The World Storytelling Institute in Chennai. The
group of partner organizations and community participants is growing every day,
along with our global support network from New York, California, Delhi, Mumbai,
Chennai, Madurai, and beyond.
• Enlisting artisans of folk art and performing
traditions from clay sculpture, paper mache, handloom weavers, Sungadi sari
makers, artisans utilizing traditional organic vegetable dye techniques,
painters, kavadi headdress builders, as well as performers of music, dance,
theater, poetry, storytelling, and ceremony. 
• Gathering key environmental educators to work
alongside the artisans for the educational workshops.
Earth Celebrations Workshops in 2012 engaging children in NYC to create Stewards of the River Robes using homemade paint made from fruits, vegetables, and plants.
Educational Community-Building Workshops: January — April 2015:Free workshops will be conducted by the artists-in-residence/workshop instructors in collaboration with environmental educators to engage community members and students, educating the participants
on the issues of the Vaigai River and solutions to be implemented. Asia
Initiatives will bring in their unique system of Social Capital Credits
(SoCCs) as a way to incentivize the community to attend the workshops and
contribute towards the river restoration. The work created in the workshops will
raise awareness for specific issues and will be presented in the Pageant.
The workshop series engages
youth and adults for 3 months to:
•  Explore
the diversity of plant and animal life as indicators of the river’s
health, as well as discuss current issues concerning pollution and waste through
a ‘place-based’ learning process.
•  Work with artists-in-residence to create spectacular
visual arts works such as mobile sculptures/puppets and costumes for the
procession inspired by the species, habitats, issues, and restoration efforts
of the river.
•  Utilize ecologically friendly practices in the
creation of art projects, incorporating the use of recycled, natural and
organic materials.
•  Engage local artisans to participate in the project creating visual art projects highlighting their folk art traditions such as: clay sculptures, costumes, handloom textiles, bamboo/paper-maché sculpture, decorative processional staffs, headdresses, masks, face painting,
palanquins/processional sculpture carts, kolam rice/chalk powder drawings,
Sungudi saree and dyeing techniques, that revive traditional vegetables dyes
rather than chemical dyes that pollute the river.
•  Social Capital Credits (SoCCs), a virtual currency for social good, will be used to implement the above processes not only during the workshops, but as a long term practice for sustainable ecological and social development. People will be able to earn SoCCs by helping with the pageant, and river cleaning actions such as waste management, maintaining irrigation channels and water tanks, planting trees etc. They will be able to use the SoCCs thus earned to get services like subsidized electricity, telephone talk time, school scholarships, healthcare, etc.

<p>Prvi put u historiji Bosne i Hercegovine ulaže se u obnovljive izvore energije pomoću grupnog finansiranja, a <strong>Vi možete postati dio te historije!</strong></p>
<p>Ova kampanja ima za cilj ulaganje u sunčevu energiju za potrebe Zavoda za zbrinjavanje mentalno invalidnih osoba „Drin“.</p>
<p>Ideja je vrlo jednostavna. Ovoj ustanovi potrebna je topla voda 24 sata dnevno i to 365 dana u godini. Dio te energije može se dobiti korištenjem sunčeve energije, te je upravo to ono što možemo postići ovom kampanjom. Na ovaj način smanjiti će se troškovi za energiju ove Ustanove čime pomažemo njenim korisnicima!</p>
<div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540313828/fb1cvq8k7q2kwusoqd3e.jpg"" src=""""/></div>

<p>Zavod za zbrinjavanje mentalno invalidnih osoba „Drin“ Fojnica osnovan je 1955. godine  i predstavlja  centar za socijalno i zdravstveno zbrinjavanje, produženo liječenje i rehabilitaciju, obučavanje za samostalan život osoba sa smetnjama u razvoju i osoba sa smetnjama u duševnom zdravlju. Ono što ovu Ustanovu čini jedinstvenom jeste da je to jedina ustanova ovog tipa u Bosni i Hercegovini koja <strong>zbrinjava i novorođenčad</strong>.</p>
<p>Danas, ova Ustanova ima <strong>oko 500 korisnika</strong> koji tu žive, te 250 zaposlenih. Cilj ove Ustanove je da omogući svojim korisnicima human boravak, da im poboljša kvalitetu življenja, te da kreira ambijent i atmosferu toploga doma.</p>
<p>Liječenje i rehabilitacija samo su dio priče o Drinu koji zapravo predstavlja veliku porodicu koja se svakodnevno suočava sa izazovima života, ali i mnogim drugim problemima. Jedan od problema svakako su i veliki računi za električnu energiju. Godišnje se za električnu energiju izdvaja <strong>preko 250.000 KM</strong>. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1538988591/yi4bydyq912n2hqu0zy3.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Kako bi smanjili troškove za energiju i novac mogli investirati za druge potrebe, ova porodica treba nas, zajednicu! </p>
<p>Ideja je <strong>uložiti novac za nabavku solarnih kolektora</strong> za potrošnu toplu vodu koji će se instalirali na krovove ove Ustanove. Solarna energija, za razliku od fosilnih goriva, dostupna je u neograničenoj mjeri i ne proizvodi štetne emisije. Instalacijom solarnih kolektora moguće je ostvariti <strong>uštede i do 60 % </strong>za pripremu potrošne tople vode,  što će povoljnije uticati i na okoliš. </p>
<p>Sa učešćem u ovoj kampanji omogućiti ćete ovoj velikoj porodici da smanji svoju potrošnju, te novac od ušteda uloži u druge, njima potrebnije stvari!!! </p>

</div></div>","Prvi put u historiji Bosne i Hercegovine ulaže se u obnovljive izvore energije pomoću grupnog finansiranja, a Vi možete postati dio te historije!
Ova kampanja ima za cilj ulaganje u sunčevu energiju za potrebe Zavoda za zbrinjavanje mentalno invalidnih osoba „Drin“.
Ideja je vrlo jednostavna. Ovoj ustanovi potrebna je topla voda 24 sata dnevno i to 365 dana u godini. Dio te energije može se dobiti korištenjem sunčeve energije, te je upravo to ono što možemo postići ovom kampanjom. Na ovaj način smanjiti će se troškovi za energiju ove Ustanove čime pomažemo njenim korisnicima!


Zavod za zbrinjavanje mentalno invalidnih osoba „Drin“ Fojnica osnovan je 1955. godine  i predstavlja  centar za socijalno i zdravstveno zbrinjavanje, produženo liječenje i rehabilitaciju, obučavanje za samostalan život osoba sa smetnjama u razvoju i osoba sa smetnjama u duševnom zdravlju. Ono što ovu Ustanovu čini jedinstvenom jeste da je to jedina ustanova ovog tipa u Bosni i Hercegovini koja zbrinjava i novorođenčad.
Danas, ova Ustanova ima oko 500 korisnika koji tu žive, te 250 zaposlenih. Cilj ove Ustanove je da omogući svojim korisnicima human boravak, da im poboljša kvalitetu življenja, te da kreira ambijent i atmosferu toploga doma.
Liječenje i rehabilitacija samo su dio priče o Drinu koji zapravo predstavlja veliku porodicu koja se svakodnevno suočava sa izazovima života, ali i mnogim drugim problemima. Jedan od problema svakako su i veliki računi za električnu energiju. Godišnje se za električnu energiju izdvaja preko 250.000 KM. 


Kako bi smanjili troškove za energiju i novac mogli investirati za druge potrebe, ova porodica treba nas, zajednicu! 
Ideja je uložiti novac za nabavku solarnih kolektora za potrošnu toplu vodu koji će se instalirali na krovove ove Ustanove. Solarna energija, za razliku od fosilnih goriva, dostupna je u neograničenoj mjeri i ne proizvodi štetne emisije. Instalacijom solarnih kolektora moguće je ostvariti uštede i do 60 % za pripremu potrošne tople vode,  što će povoljnije uticati i na okoliš. 
Sa učešćem u ovoj kampanji omogućiti ćete ovoj velikoj porodici da smanji svoju potrošnju, te novac od ušteda uloži u druge, njima potrebnije stvari!!! 


Angažmanom u ovoj kampanji učestvujte u nabavci i instalaciji solarnih kolektora. 
Za ovaj poduhvat potrebno nam je minimalno 20.000 KM, odnosno 15.000 USD. 
Pripremili smo i ručno rađene poklone. Svi pokloni su dizajnirani i kreirani od strane korisnika ove ustanove. 

Ukoliko niste spremni finansijski podržati ovu kampanju molimo Vas da slanjem e-mailova Vašim kolegama i prijateljima, te postavljanjem ove kampanje na društvenim mrežama, učestvujete u ovoj održivoj priči! 


Promocija inicijativa za građansku energiju, obnovljivi izvori energije i energijska efikasnost su budućnost Bosne i Hercegovine.
Pokažimo da je moguće finansirati projekte građanske energije kako bi se u budućnosti povećao  broj inicijativa. 
Energija mora i treba biti u rukama građana i iz tog razloga želimo da stavimo građane u centar dešavanja.
Vrijeme je da energiju vratimo građanima, vrijeme je za inicijative za građansku energiju.

They are places where children learn the wonders of the world and teachers prepare the next generation of leaders and citizens. Not all schools are built and operated to be full of clean air and sunlight and to be free of toxic materials and harmful chemicals. <br/><br/>We seek to change that by helping Wisconsin schools become more green. For the 2014 Green Apple Day of Service, the Wisconsin Green Building Alliance's Green Schools Committee wants to give support to Wisconsin schools to host interactive projects focused on recycling and waste reduction for the 2014 Green Apple Day of Service. Green Apple Day of Service is officially on September 27, 2014, but projects will be held within a 4 - 6 week span of the date. Here are a few examples of the types of projects your donation may fund:<p></p><ul>
<li>A waste stream sort to learn about where trash goes and the importance of recycling and reusing</li>
<li>Creation of a new recycling program or a recycling campaign</li>
<li>Planning and implementation of a solid waste management policy</li>
<li>An e-waste recycling drive</li>

<p></p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>The Wisconsin Green Building Alliance's Green Schools Committee is collecting donations to support Wisconsin schools participating in Green Apple Day of Service. Our goal is to raise $7000 by May 31, 2014. We hope to give 60 schools $100 towards a project that helps to green their school.</p>
<p>Whether we reach our goal, all funding raised through this campaign will go to Wisconsin schools.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>More than 20% of public schools in the U.S. report having unsatisfactory indoor air quality. Controlling exposure to indoor environmental factors, such as carbon monoxide, dust, and pollen, could prevent more than 65% of asthma cases among elementary school-age children.<br/>
</li>
<li>When ventilation rates are at or below minimum standards, an associated decrease of 5-10% occurs in certain aspects of student performance tests.<br/>
</li>
<li>A green school with acoustical ceiling tiles, lined ductwork and HVAC systems with appropriately placed vents, provides an environment that lessens distractions and encourages participation.<br/>
</li>
<li>Comfortable indoor temperatures enhance productivity and keep students more alert. <br/>
</li>
<li>Green schools use 33% less energy and 32% less water than conventionally constructed schools, significantly reducing utility costs over the average 42-year lifecycle of a school.<br/>
</li>
<li>Students can become ambassadors of social and environmental responsibility, educating their family, friends and community about the value of sustainable lifestyles.<br/>
</li>
<li>Green schools provide a clear opportunity to connect students with curricula in environmental and science technology engineering and mathematics (STEM) education, and can serve as a tool for interactive lessons across all subjects.<br/>

More than 20% of public schools in the U.S. report having unsatisfactory indoor air quality. Controlling exposure to indoor environmental factors, such as carbon monoxide, dust, and pollen, could prevent more than 65% of asthma cases among elementary school-age children.

When ventilation rates are at or below minimum standards, an associated decrease of 5-10% occurs in certain aspects of student performance tests.

A green school with acoustical ceiling tiles, lined ductwork and HVAC systems with appropriately placed vents, provides an environment that lessens distractions and encourages participation.

Comfortable indoor temperatures enhance productivity and keep students more alert. 

Green schools use 33% less energy and 32% less water than conventionally constructed schools, significantly reducing utility costs over the average 42-year lifecycle of a school.

Students can become ambassadors of social and environmental responsibility, educating their family, friends and community about the value of sustainable lifestyles.

<p>Meanwhile, on our to-do list is building a team of volunteers world wide via social media which will organize beach clean-ups. The waste collection from these beach clean ups will be shipped  to the TCOM plant located in Hawaii. COORC not only has a goal to build a team of volunteers but to also  work with corporations that will help fund our clean-up processes in the long term. We are about community and long term improvements that last.  </p><p></p><p>One solution out of the many we  incorporate into our plans is <b>TCOM</b> Biomass technology. 


TCOM  stands for <b>Thermo Combustion of Organic Material</b>.  A long term goal of COORC is to establish self sustaining power plants in remote areas of the world that can revolutionize the value of debris and plastic in our oceans and on our shores. Please be sure to check back here on our IndieGoGo pages to have a look at our updates for more information on TCOM.

COORC Is Proud To Sponsor Algalita Marine Research Institute.  With help from COORC Captain Moore and the crew of the <b>Alguita</b>  set out from Long Beach, CA in July, 2014, to live in the Garbage Patch for six weeks.  The team of scientist conducted research to compliment Captain 
Moore's 15 years of research and sampling the GPGP. COORC.ORG is happy to have  
sponsored Moore with new sails for the voyage along with a new Satellite System for ship to shore communications.  COORC also
 hired a Master of Advanced Studies, Marine Biodiversity and <a href=""https://scripps.ucsd.edu/masters/mas"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Conservation Scripps Institution of Oceanography </a>graduate as a 
videographer and helping hand on board the Voyage.  The footage that she collected in the process of documenting the story of these scientists out there on this scientific journey will be part of a feature length documentary being produced by COORC.  This voyage has data sampled the largest segment of the ocean to-date. They <b>discovered a whole new, seven ton, unnatural, ecosystem</b> made out of Hi-Zex buoys in the middle of the Pacific, fish mutations, and startling  levels of pollution. COORC has other projects on-going that give support to things like the testing of samples and collecting and documenting the story of people's 'body  burden' which will become part of our documentary. Your body burden is a term that describes the levels and types of toxic chemicals in your body; some of those chemicals are there to stay. <br/></p>

We are fund-raising for coastal clean-ups world wide. Come join us. First we are happy to announce that every donation will be matched up to the goal amount when reached! So your $10 donation becomes $20 for COORC and so on and so on.  COORC stands for CLEAN OUR OCEANS REFUGE COALITION.  We are a non-profit organization that I founded shortly after watching the feature length documentary film ""Trashed"". This documentary which is produced by and stars Jeremy Irons is an eye opener to the awful truth and health problems being caused around the world by this ocean pollution problem. I was so moved by this film that I felt a call to action.  I answered that call when I formed COORC and I am here today to tell you more about what we are up to and how you can play your part in the solution.  





Today COORC.ORG is an organization with zero salaries given to our board members and is 100% transparent. In addition to managing our own projects we give aid in various forms to other organizations and individuals that share our goals.





Matching donations until the goal amount is reached

Team Building
Meanwhile, on our to-do list is building a team of volunteers world wide via social media which will organize beach clean-ups. The waste collection from these beach clean ups will be shipped  to the TCOM plant located in Hawaii. COORC not only has a goal to build a team of volunteers but to also  work with corporations that will help fund our clean-up processes in the long term. We are about community and long term improvements that last.  One solution out of the many we  incorporate into our plans is TCOM Biomass technology. 


TCOM  stands for Thermo Combustion of Organic Material.  A long term goal of COORC is to establish self sustaining power plants in remote areas of the world that can revolutionize the value of debris and plastic in our oceans and on our shores. Please be sure to check back here on our IndieGoGo pages to have a look at our updates for more information on TCOM. 

Two Donation Perks We are Offering Qualify You for On-Screen Title Credits in the Documentary Imagine having an Internet Movie Database listing as an associate producer or  producer that you can point your friends, family, and clients to. Imagine going to film festivals and being part of the filmmakers panel and receiving awards and having your name credited in news and magazine articles. Here you can help a great project and build a new career in the film industry with your first title credit or add to your film resume by being the support funding for this film project.  Shooting and editing is underway. 


Our Good Works
COORC Is Proud To Sponsor Algalita Marine Research Institute.  With help from COORC Captain Moore and the crew of the Alguita  set out from Long Beach, CA in July, 2014, to live in the Garbage Patch for six weeks.  The team of scientist conducted research to compliment Captain 
Moore's 15 years of research and sampling the GPGP. COORC.ORG is happy to have  
sponsored Moore with new sails for the voyage along with a new Satellite System for ship to shore communications.  COORC also
 hired a Master of Advanced Studies, Marine Biodiversity and  Conservation Scripps Institution of Oceanography graduate as a 
videographer and helping hand on board the Voyage.  The footage that she collected in the process of documenting the story of these scientists out there on this scientific journey will be part of a feature length documentary being produced by COORC.  This voyage has data sampled the largest segment of the ocean to-date. They discovered a whole new, seven ton, unnatural, ecosystem made out of Hi-Zex buoys in the middle of the Pacific, fish mutations, and startling  levels of pollution. COORC has other projects on-going that give support to things like the testing of samples and collecting and documenting the story of people's 'body  burden' which will become part of our documentary. Your body burden is a term that describes the levels and types of toxic chemicals in your body; some of those chemicals are there to stay.

<h3>Hello,<br/><br/>My name is Johnathan F Mendez. I am currently involved with a small local group of people who are teaching kids and adults alike about the importance of keeping our planet clean. Every week  10 students from different public schools are chosen for our project. What we do is basically get these uninformed children and bring them to places that need to be cleaned Beaches,Metropolitan areas,Business areas, Parks,fields etc. Basically anywhere that our group<br/>might find things to clean we stop and get to work. Some children have a hard time understanding why we do what we do. Many kids never even comeback. But some of them do return and help us randomly. What we are trying to teach these children is basically to get things done sometimes you just have to do it yourself. Meaning do not toss that water bottle out of your car when your on the highway because it will probably be there years to come. So that is where The Quest Project comes in to play. These kids come from all walks of life from the least fortunate to the 16 year old the shows up to help us in his brand new BMW every week. Yes that is one of our best stories. We meet this young individual while cleaning up a river close to a main street. When all of a sudden a bottle comes flying on to a raft we were using. But then for some reason this young man comes walking up to us and says "" hey sorry about that did i hit anybody?"" I was in shock that he actually got out of his car. And i was pretty mad. Long story short he asked what the heck we were doing and i simply said cleaning up. Next thing out of his mouth was and those little kids over there there not supposed to be down here. I said to him yes they are part of our group. Basically this kid had all he ever wanted but no real friends. I noticed this and offered him a spot to help us clean. He actually accepted and started helping us right there. 8 months later we have became very good friends and he now helps us weekly even buys the kids lunch once in a while. <br/><br/>Sorry for the story but if you knew me personally you would understand it a little more. <br/><br/>These Funds i am asking for is to be able to purchase many things to keep on helping these kids out. I am young my self i recently finished College this year and see nothing better to do with my life right now but to help out these children. Not all of them show up with funds to buy a snack neither do i have transportation to pick them up all at the same time. Sometimes they meet up in groups and ride the public bus together to get to where we all meet. I would really like to be able to purchase a vehicle large enough for the kids and junk we acquire weekly. I am not sure if this website really works but you don't know until you actually try. There will be a YouTube page made soon showing what we do and how we do it so stay tuned and enjoy life that's all we really have.</h3>

plant and animal life from the time of the dinosaurs. We should move 
toward clean, green, alternative energy technologies instead of spending
 money on dinosaur technologies like fracking.<br/></p><br/>Fester the Frackasaurus will be an 15-foot high inflatable character, and will provide the large, visual representation of our campaign necessary to get people's attention and drive coverage of our work. Fester will provide people a focal point to raise awareness surrounding fracking harms. Fester will travel the country and be set up at rallies, information sessions and public events to generate conversation about fracking. He'll be hard to miss on roadsides across America!<br/><br/>Fester will be made out of nylon, a PVC-free synthetic material. He will have grey skin with black spots and will be wearing a yellow hard hat, orange vest, and construction boots, helping to represent the oil industry.

<p>Short for hydrofracturing, fracking is the process of injecting a mixture of water, sand and chemicals into deep, horizontal wells under very high pressure in order to fracture rock deep underground, releasing trapped hydrocarbons and bringing them to the surface. Fracking presents a wide range of human and environmental health issues, much of which revolves around contamination of drinking water and disposal of the toxic waste generated by fracking operations. Additionally, it reinforces our reliance on archaic fossil fuel technology.</p>

Due to a fire at our offices March 21st we are pausing this campaign. We are unable to access our server to reach the audience that would likely support building this new friend to assist communities fighting fracking harms.  Stay tuned we'll be back when our offices are fully functional.  Thank you for your support.The Center for Health, Environment & Justice has organized a campaign to prevent fracking harms, and we need a mascot to be the face of our campaign. Why a dinosaur?Because fracking is a dinosaur technology, both 
literally and figuratively. Fracking feeds our reliance on fossil fuels,
 and it accesses the hydrocarbons that are a result of the decay of 
plant and animal life from the time of the dinosaurs. We should move 
toward clean, green, alternative energy technologies instead of spending
 money on dinosaur technologies like fracking.Fester the Frackasaurus will be an 15-foot high inflatable character, and will provide the large, visual representation of our campaign necessary to get people's attention and drive coverage of our work. Fester will provide people a focal point to raise awareness surrounding fracking harms. Fester will travel the country and be set up at rallies, information sessions and public events to generate conversation about fracking. He'll be hard to miss on roadsides across America!Fester will be made out of nylon, a PVC-free synthetic material. He will have grey skin with black spots and will be wearing a yellow hard hat, orange vest, and construction boots, helping to represent the oil industry. He will be built by Gene Stilp, who previously constructed an existing inflatable mascot for us.Why Fight Fracking?

Short for hydrofracturing, fracking is the process of injecting a mixture of water, sand and chemicals into deep, horizontal wells under very high pressure in order to fracture rock deep underground, releasing trapped hydrocarbons and bringing them to the surface. Fracking presents a wide range of human and environmental health issues, much of which revolves around contamination of drinking water and disposal of the toxic waste generated by fracking operations. Additionally, it reinforces our reliance on archaic fossil fuel technology.

<p>The bottom line, is  the very best thing we can do to enhance and restore our marine ecosystem is to build well designed fish reefs.  Any envrionmental project in the ocean must have the support of the fishermen and environmental groups in order to work. The Fish Reef Project has broad based support.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Many natural reefs have been impacted from human use. By creating new ones, we can revive many areas of the seafloor that are currently unhealthy.</p>
<p>The Reefs will convert empty mud seafloor into thriving kelp and coral ecosystems. They will work by allowing  a fraction more plankton to find hard bottom to settle on, and then grow into greater plants and animals. </p>
<p>The Fish Reef Project will create a series of five acre reefs in California and later in Hawaii. Each reef will quicly grow kelp and coral. The reefs are made from igloo shaped cement reef balls and they provide ample feeding and breeding ground  for fish, lobster, abalone, sea birds and marine mammals. The reefs unite the ocean community, they cost no tax payer dollars to maintain or enforce. We will place them on muddy seafloor that has likely already been compromised by human use over the years. The Fish Reef Project is cutting edge and the only operation of its kind in California and Hawaii.</p>

English version
Short summaryUndae is an educational and environmental-friendly video game (only for Windows for the moment).The main character (Undae) is a water drop with super powers used to clean the pollutants it will encounter during the game.It takes place all along the water cycle: beginning in the ocean, then going to evaporation, condensation, precipitation, runoff and finally going back to the ocean.In the 35 playable levels, you will find about 100 pollutants including:

Everyday life wastes such as fruit peeling, cardboard boxes, plastic bags


Heavy fuels, oils,


Various gas,


Particles,...

Each pollutant will have its card on the web site to learn more about it.Cleaning will have a cost in terms of money (crystals) and will give money according to the correctness of the weapon used. When Undae is touched by a pollutant, it loses some life and dies when it's out of life.There are 5 ways to deal with pollutants:

Burrow: representing the easiest way to get rid of pollution: burrowing it, throwing it away. Easy and cheap but limited and give few money.

Fire or Burn: representing incinerating. It works on a lot of pollutants but can create new (worst) pollutants: toxic gas and micro particles.
Filter: representing filtering or collecting the micro particles and oils.
Recycle: self-explanatory, it is used on pollutants whose components can be reused.
Separator: some pollutants cannot be processed without having been separated first.
And what more?The game is based on an open homemade engine. That means that everybody can create the same kind of game with no special computer knowledge.All the game is about some text files describing objects and behaviors (+ images and sound in common formats). It is quite simple to have a few interacting characters but it can become hard to build a full game. In order to make it the simplest as possible, we worked on a graphical editor to allow everybody to be able to create any simple game, and improve it to something sophisticated.The editor even includes features that were not used in Undae such as 2D physics. It could be quite straight forward to clone a level in the ""Angry Bird"" style for example.The editor will be free and we would want everyone to be able to create simple games and distribute it via our/their web site. This tool would be aimed at associations who want to have promotion product or any individual just for fun. Of course it is not intended to compete with the market leaders. As we're mostly working on the game, the editor is not completed yet. But it will be the next improvement, along with including Mac and Linux compatibility.About usWe are Aurélie and David. We have been working on creating Undae for several years. We decided to start with it in 2008 because we were feeling helpless facing the news about increasing pollution, climate change and every environmental concerns.Thinking about what we could do to help, we considered a game for children (and everybody else) to learn about pollution while playing a video game.Unfortunately, we are now stuck because the game is nearly finished but we still need to spend time and money to complete it and the web site on one hand, and to promote it and to meet our clients on the other hand. Unlike ""classic"" games, we need to find the people concerned about environmental issues and also interested in video games. So a lot of time is required to find them and show them our project.Our business model is based on collaboration with associations and NGOs. When someone buy the game, he chooses an association and 25% of the price will be donated to the association. It is mostly to help, and work with, smallest ones. Also, we think this model could be a way to help a lot of small associations and we would want to prove it can work so that other project creators could do the same.What We Need & What You GetTo complete the game, we need to perform some tests to ensure it works on people's computers and do the corrections where needed. Also we must finish and populate the web site with game help. In the meantime, we need to go and show the game to the associations, during exhibition etc... It is a lot of time we need to spend and we're now out of money.Helping us, you will get game product keys and you will be able to suggest associations to work with. Of course, best donators will be credited at the game ending and on the dedicated web site page.If we can't reach the entire goal, we will still make the game available for download, but depending on the amount, we won't be able to correct installation/compatibility issues and develop the editor. Every product key will be delivered in any cases.The ImpactUndae is an usual game, having hero, weapons and enemies. But, here, every action can cause ecological disaster if it is not the good one, and rewards the player otherwise. Even if the child doesn't think about what he is really doing, he will understand quickly which the worst pollutants are, which are easy to clean, and which ones are dangerous and hard to clean. The well documented website will contain the pollutants descriptions and the way to deal with them. This is where parents can be involved by helping children to understand why such action have such consequence.During the development, we have been brought face to face with children and parents. Children are like hypnotized by the game, so hopefully it can have a positive impact on them. Parents, of course are often a bit reluctant to let children play with another computer game. But when we showed them the concept, and we explained that a lot of children will anyway play with video games, they often realize that it is even better to, at least, learn something while playing.On the other-hand, we want to be part of a brand new business model where smallest associations can have the means to act, being supported by other small companies. It's a win-win process where associations are purchasing advisor with little investment (such as flyers/e-mails for their members), and the product creator can access their clients for a low price.Doing that allows to avoid mainstream medias that could be biased and, in any cases, are far too expensive.Other Ways You Can HelpYou can't give money ? We mostly need reputation. We need it for that campaign of course, but we also need it for our project. Having a lot of visitors on the website will give us confidence. Like us on Facebook and share the website link with your friends. Also, talk about us, try the demo and send us your feedback (via the website).

Version française
Résumé du projetUndae est un jeu vidéo éducatif et environnemental (seulement pour Windows pour l'instant).Le personnage principal (Undae) est une goutte d'eau dotée de super pouvoirs lui permettant de nettoyer les polluants qu'elle rencontrera pendant le jeu.Le jeu se déroule le long du cycle de l'eau: il commence dans l'océan puis se déroule lors de l'évaporation, la condensation, les précipitations, le ruissellement, et enfin revient dans l'océan.Durant les 35 niveaux jouables, vous trouverez une centaine de polluants dont:
Les déchets de tous les jours comme pelures de fruits, emballages en carton, sacs en plastique,
Pétrole, huiles,...
Divers gaz,
Particules,...
Chaque polluant aura sa fiche sur le site web pour en savoir plus à son égard.Nettoyer aura un coût en monnaie du jeu (cristaux) et récompensera en conséquence de l'arme utilisée. Quand Undae est touchée par un polluant, elle perd de la vie et meurt quand elle n'a plus de vie.Il y a 5 moyens d'action pour traiter la pollution:

Enterrer: représente le moyen le plus facile de se débarrasser de la pollution: l'enterrer ou jeter les déchets. Facile et pas cher mais limité et n'apporte que peu de monnaie.

Brûler: représente l'incinération. Cela marche sur beaucoup de polluants mais peut causer de nouvelles pollutions encore pires: gaz toxiques et micro-particules.

Filtrer: représente la filtration et la collecte de micro-particules et d'huile.

Recycler: utilisé sur tous les polluants dont on peut récupérer les matières.

Trier: certains polluants ne peuvent pas être traités avant d'avoir été trié.
Et quoi d'autre?Le jeu est construit sur un moteur fait maison. Cela signifie que tout le monde peut créer le même type de jeu sans connaissance particulière en informatique.L'ensemble du jeu ne tourne qu'autour de quelques fichiers textes qui décrivent les objets et les comportements (+ les images et les sons dans des formats courants). Il est assez facile d'avoir quelques personnages en interaction mais il peut devenir plus difficile de construire un jeu complet. Dans le but de faciliter cette tâche, nous avons travaillé sur un éditeur graphique permettant à tout le monde de créer n'importe quel jeu basique et de l'améliorer en quelque chose de plus abouti.L'éditeur inclue même quelques fonctions qui n'ont pas été utilisées dans Undae comme la gestion de la physique 2D. Cela permettrait de facilement cloner un niveau dans le style de ""Angry Bird"" par exemple.L'éditeur sera gratuit et nous aimerions que tout le monde puisse créer des jeux simples et les distribuer via notre site ou le leur. Cet outil sera à destination des associations qui veulent un produit d'appel ou n'importe qui d'autre juste pour s'amuser. Bien sûr, il n'est pas question de concurrencer les gros acteurs du secteur. Comme nous travaillons en priorité sur le jeu, l'éditeur est loin d'être terminé. Mais il sera la prochaine amélioration avec l'ajout de la compatibilité pour Mac et Linux.A propos de nousNous sommes Aurélie et David. Nous travaillons sur la création de Undae depuis plusieurs années. Nous avons décidé de nous lancer dans ce projet en 2008 car nous nous sentions impuissants face à tout ce qui concernait l'augmentation de la pollution, le changement climatique et toutes les questions environnementales.En réfléchissant à ce que nous pourrions faire de notre côté, nous avons pensé à un jeu pour les enfants (et n'importe qui d'autre) leur permettant d'apprendre des choses sur la pollution tout en jouant à un jeu vidéo.Malheureusement, nous sommes maintenant bloqués car le jeu est presque terminé mais nous avons encore besoin de  temps et d'argent pour aller au bout de sa réalisation et de celle du site web d'une part, et d'autre part d'en assurer la promotion et de rencontrer nos clients d'autre part. Contrairement aux jeux ""classiques"", nous avons besoin de trouver les gens à la fois intéressés aux questions environnementales et aux jeux vidéos. Nous avons donc besoin de beaucoup de temps pour les rechercher et leur présenter le projet.Notre modèle économique est basé sur la collaboration avec les associations et les ONGs. Si quelqu'un achète un jeu, il peut choisir une association et 25% du prix est reversé à l'association. Ceci dans le but d'aider et de travailler avec les plus petites structures. De plus, nous pensons que ce modèle peut être un moyen d'aider un grand nombre de petites associations et nous aimerions prouver qu'il peut fonctionner. Ainsi d'autres porteurs de projets pourraient en faire autant.Nos besoins et vos compensationsPour terminer le jeu, nous avons besoin d'effectuer des tests pour s'assurer de son bon fonctionnement sur les ordinateurs de tout le monde, et faire les corrections adéquates le cas échéant.

What's the big deal about water catchment?

The combination of harvesting rain combined with graywater reuse can literally save the world while definitely saving you money.   Did you know that reusing greywater can save well over 50% of the average American family’s household water usage -- and that's without harvesting rainwater?

Water reuse fundamentals

Household wastewater is classified into two groups - greywater and blackwater. Greywater refers to the wastewater from your shower, laundry machines, and bathroom sinks. It contains bacteria, fiber particles, and dead skin cells, which is very nourishing for your garden plants, and doesn’t pose a huge health risk.  Blackwater refers to the wastewater from your toilet and kitchen sink, because it is loaded with feces and grease. It can contain animal parasites and excess nitrogen that will pollute the environment.  Greywater can be fed directly to your garden plants, whereas blackwater needs deeper filtration to be safe for returning to the ecosystem.
Harvesting rainwater off of your roof can fulfill one-third of your household water needs each year. Add that to a greywater system that reuses your household water to water your garden and lawn, and you’ve basically met close to two-thirds of your household water needs. How’s that for saving money on water?

<h3><b>What’s the
problem?</b></h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Polar bears are threatened from many sides. Most people think that the only really big problem they face are the effects of climate change. This myth is being perpetuated by almost all the persons and institutions who have a say in polar bear matters. But in the meantime, a completely unsustainable and anachronistic hunting regime is being allowed to continue. Polar bears are indeed facing extinction. But it is not because of global warming alone - it is because that while global warming continues, we are allowing them to be shot out! </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It is quite simple: The numbers do not add up. There are possibly fewer
than 20.000 polar bears in the world today, their recruitment rate is almost
certainly less than 4% per year, and yet we purposefully shoot about 5% of them
per year. Polar bears are knowingly and systematically being extirpated.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A convergence of interests leads to this being condoned by the majority
of the polar bear nations, Inuit leaders, elite scientists, polar bear managers,
and our largest conservation NGOs. The precautionary principle is not applied
to polar bear management, and there is no arms-length principle between
hunters, managers, scientists and politicians. Conservation efforts are
symbolic at best and totally insufficient.</p>
<p>Even without the hunt, the species’ survival chances in the wild are on
thin ice. Every individual living polar bear increases the survival chances of
the species. Every dead polar bear is worth nothing.</p>

Did you know that most of the 1000/year hunt is legal and condoned by those supposedly responsible
for keeping polar bears safe in the face of climate change and an uncertain
future? And that the community of stakeholders is covering up the facts,
disguising the numbers, manipulating the picture, in order to safeguard
commercial interests rather than polar bears? 
Would you like to do something to change this?
I have written a book documenting the reality of failed polar bear
conservation. The book will be published late April 2015. The more help I get with
the financing, the wider the message can get out. This will hopefully be the
beginning of a worldwide campaign to save polar bears. 


In this impassioned book Morten raises very important, provocative questions that are not being addressed by the international environmental groups. Questions we must pay attention to lest the legacy of our generation be one of being forewarned without acting in the face of species extinction.

And the influx of others of like mind and heart will inspire, uplift and unify all who come.








Learning ancient Ayurvedic techniques to bring nature back to balance and heal the atmosphere


Practicing Yoga and meditation










Practicing creative arts to heal mind body spirit







Learning about how to form and live in small communities


Using folk medicine, wild and organically grown herbs for healing and wellness 






Implementing green architecture and building with sustainable materials


Organic food growing, organic beekeeping and sustainable agriculture







Organic vegetarian cooking for wellness and rejuvenation





Over the years, we have been able to educate and share our collective 
skills and environmental healing methods with literally thousands of 
people. Now has come the time for major expansion in order to 
accommodate the increasing numbers who wish to learn and experience life
 at our Ecovillage.Through our continued practice of ancient 
Ayurvedic science over the past 20 years, we provide the living proof 
that we can offer workable solutions which help correct, heal, nourish, 
and restore balance to whole eco-systems.

So far we have 
completed the first phase of the building, which include foundations and
 basement. Now we are crowdfunding the next stage of this amazing 
project. We need to raise a total of $108,000 USD.
Once this 
next phase is finished, we will be able to offer clay building 
workshops, invite volunteers to learn and work with sustainable building
 techniques, and help complete the structure of our Centre.Any additional funds raised will go into the next phases of building.



Ecovillage Bhrugu Aranya is a blossoming international Homa organic farm community in Poland. At present, 14 adults and 4 children reside here. Residents range in age from 8 to 91, and are an eclectic group of artists, healers, writers, filmmakers, musicians, therapists, gardeners, teachers and herbalists. We are a collection of international pioneers who want to heal the planet from the grass roots up!

<h3>What is at Stake?</h3> <p></p>
<p>Property rights, environment, and economy, are all threatened by an unnecessary pipeline for the profit of a few corporate executives and investors.</p>
<p>Property rights:</p>
<ul>
<li>of those from whom Sabal Trail would take an hundred-foot wide easement;</li>
<li>of anyone within the more than 1,000-foot blast radius;</li>
<li>of anyone whose well might get polluted or whose land might develop a sinkhole due to pipeline drilling;</li>
<li>of taxpayers who would end up paying for leaks, sinkholes, or explosions.</li>

<div>
<p>Environment: the pipeline would go right through the most vulnerable area of the fragile karst limestone which houses our springs and the Floridan Aquifer, the source of a large part of our drinking water. Plus threats to wildlife, to native plants, and of introduction of invasive species.</p>
<p>Economy: tourism is one of Florida's major industries, and everything from agriculture to drinking water depends on the Floridan Aquifer; all threatened by this pipeline.</p>
</div>
<p>WWALS petitioned FL-DEP to deny that permit, and has been granted an administrative hearing to argue many of these points.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Why Florida? Why DEP?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>While Sabal Trail has applied to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for a permit for this interstate pipeline, FERC required Sabal Trail to get state permits such as this one from FL-DEP.</p>
<p>So it appears that without that DEP permit, there can be no pipeline.</p>
<p>According to DEP, without resolution of these proceedings, there can be no permit.</p>
<p>Low-lying Florida is the state with the most at risk from climate change, due to sea level rise, methane is 25 times worse than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas according to the EPA, and fracking, pipelines, and LNG export all leak methane.</p>
<p>As the Sierra Club chapters of Alabama, Georgia, and Florida said back in March 2014, Florida doesn't need to become even more dependent on gas pipelines. The Sunshine State should go directly to solar power, which is faster, cheaper, and far cleaner and safer than any pipeline.</p>

of anyone within the more than 1,000-foot blast radius;
of anyone whose well might get polluted or whose land might develop a sinkhole due to pipeline drilling;
of taxpayers who would end up paying for leaks, sinkholes, or explosions.

 


Environment: the pipeline would go right through the most vulnerable area of the fragile karst limestone which houses our springs and the Floridan Aquifer, the source of a large part of our drinking water. Plus threats to wildlife, to native plants, and of introduction of invasive species.
Economy: tourism is one of Florida's major industries, and everything from agriculture to drinking water depends on the Floridan Aquifer; all threatened by this pipeline.

WWALS petitioned FL-DEP to deny that permit, and has been granted an administrative hearing to argue many of these points.   Why Florida? Why DEP?

While Sabal Trail has applied to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for a permit for this interstate pipeline, FERC required Sabal Trail to get state permits such as this one from FL-DEP.
So it appears that without that DEP permit, there can be no pipeline.
According to DEP, without resolution of these proceedings, there can be no permit.
Low-lying Florida is the state with the most at risk from climate change, due to sea level rise, methane is 25 times worse than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas according to the EPA, and fracking, pipelines, and LNG export all leak methane.
As the Sierra Club chapters of Alabama, Georgia, and Florida said back in March 2014, Florida doesn't need to become even more dependent on gas pipelines. The Sunshine State should go directly to solar power, which is faster, cheaper, and far cleaner and safer than any pipeline.


Who is WWALS?

WWALS Watershed Coalition, Inc., a Waterkeeper® Affiliate, is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation that advocates for conservation and stewardship of the Withlacoochee, Willacoochee, Alapaha, Little, and Upper Suwannee River watersheds in south Georgia and north Florida through awareness, environmental monitoring, and citizen activities.


WWALS represents not only its own members, but also the members of the public in the areas where the pipeline is to be drilled, who will derive no benefit from the pipeline whatsoever, but will bear the burden of damage to the waterways and natural environment, degradation of springs and water quality, adverse effects on wildlife, and the risks of explosions.

WWALS has been fighting this pipeline since at least November 2013, and has been an intervenor on the FERC docket since December 2014.
Two WWALS members were instrumental in getting Sabal Trail to move off of the Withlacoochee (north) River in Florida.
Now WWALS wants Sabal Trail off the Suwannee River, out of Florida, and cancelled.   Other Ways You Can Help

<p>“Click.”  It’s the sound
of fitting together two jagged pieces of a delicate, crystalline cave formation
known as gypsum.  New Mexico natives Jim
Werker and Val Hildreth-Werker volunteer in Mammoth Cave National
Park’s Crystal Cave, diligently searching for that “click”, repairing
damage that occurred in 1995 when three vandals broke formations along a mile
of passageway.  </p>
<p>The Werkers are seasoned cave restorers; the couple
literally wrote the book on cave restoration – <i>CaveConservation
and Restoration</i> describes innovative techniques to repair damaged
formations.  They “click” with this job!</p>
<p>The restoration process is intricate and time consuming.  Gypsum is extremely brittle and heavy, making it
difficult to handle.  The Werkers and
their team often put in 8 to 10-hour days as volunteers. They must find the matching
pieces, glue them back together, and attach the finished product to the wall
using stainless steel rods.</p>
<p>“The big thing is figuring out how to rig it so it will stay
in place,” said Jim. “We use a lot of bungee cords and small clamps.  It takes
several days for the glue to set.” Once the epoxy is dry it can withstand
50,000 pounds per square inch of pressure. Afterwards the seams and bolts are
undetectable. The completed walls are even dusted with a loose powdering
of cave dirt so that the colors match.</p>

</p><p style="""">When maintaining 100 hectares of
unspoiled countryside, tree poaching is not the first problem one
considers.  But in Alentejo, Portugal’s premier wine region, cork oaks are
in high demand despite their protected status.  Gephel Ling’s land has
been hard hit by illegal tree cutting, with whole hillsides denuded of these
small native oaks, some of the only trees hardy enough to withstand the dry,
endlessly sunny summers.  It’s heartbreaking to see the freshly cut stumps
shining among the lavender.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/788968/files/20140814185712-10409399_1388837248021669_3279980748681551437_n.jpg?1408067832"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Gephel Ling is now inhabited
full time and the tree cutting has stopped, but the damage must be
repaired.  We have started this campaign not only to replace the lost
trees but to plant more than were stolen, including fruit trees in order to
make the retreat centre more self sufficient.  Soil erosion is a serious
problem in this region because of the arid summers, and deforestation only
makes it worse.  Additionally, hunting of the native boar and other
wildlife is a popular local pastime, and as a Buddhist centre is it our
aspiration to create a sanctuary for all living things.  Reforesting our
land will help to create that haven.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/788971/files/20140814185933-10302413_1388837284688332_7310807450156636290_n.jpg?1408067973"" src="""" style=""""/></p>In order to plant these trees,
we need your help.  Every Euro donated will go directly to purchasing
trees for planting, with the work being done by volunteers.  This is an

plant some trees.  Any amount you can afford to give will be greatly

<p></p></div>","When maintaining 100 hectares of
unspoiled countryside, tree poaching is not the first problem one
considers.  But in Alentejo, Portugal’s premier wine region, cork oaks are
in high demand despite their protected status.  Gephel Ling’s land has
been hard hit by illegal tree cutting, with whole hillsides denuded of these
small native oaks, some of the only trees hardy enough to withstand the dry,
endlessly sunny summers.  It’s heartbreaking to see the freshly cut stumps
shining among the lavender.Gephel Ling is now inhabited
full time and the tree cutting has stopped, but the damage must be
repaired.  We have started this campaign not only to replace the lost
trees but to plant more than were stolen, including fruit trees in order to
make the retreat centre more self sufficient.  Soil erosion is a serious
problem in this region because of the arid summers, and deforestation only
makes it worse.  Additionally, hunting of the native boar and other
wildlife is a popular local pastime, and as a Buddhist centre is it our
aspiration to create a sanctuary for all living things.  Reforesting our
land will help to create that haven.In order to plant these trees,
we need your help.  Every Euro donated will go directly to purchasing
trees for planting, with the work being done by volunteers.  This is an
ongoing project, and even if we do not reach our goal every month, we can still
plant some trees.  Any amount you can afford to give will be greatly
appreciated, and if you cannot contribute financially please help by sharing
our campaign on Facebook.
Muito Obrigado, from Southern Portugal!****
Thubten Phuntsog Gephel Ling is
a new and growing retreat centre located on 100 hectares (250 acres) in the
Alentejo region of Southern Portugal.  It is owned and operated by the
Centro de Estudos Tibetanos (CET), Pendê Ling, of
the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism in Estoril, Lisbon, under the auspices
of Lama Gyurme and Lama Chökyi Dorje.  Gephel Ling currently offers
retreat facilities for individuals and groups, and hopes to soon be able to
host meditation and other courses, rejuvenating holiday stays, and to offer

<p>The <b>Broad-winged Hawk</b> is a common raptor but its numbers are decline. In 2014, our team tagged four birds in Pennsylvania using satellite telemetry: three juveniles and one adult were tagged, including siblings from the same nest. Now, the birds are moving more than 4,000 miles from Pennsylvania to Central and South America. The tags allow us to track the birds for up to two years.</p>
<p><strong>View the tracking maps now:  </strong><a href=""http://www.hawkmountain.org/birdtracker"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>www.hawkmountain.org/birdtracker</strong></a><br/><br/><strong>NEW: We need to expand this research:</strong><br/>Supporters will help us to observe 8 new broadwing nests from different forest types, and to satellite-tag 10 new birds to expand the data set in 2015. Does food and behavior vary by habitat? Do birds from different areas have similar migration timings? Will the birds winter in the same region? Your support will help answer these questions and more. We also hope to compare adults to juveniles, and (new!) males to females. </p>
<p><strong>Challenges on Migration:</strong><br/>Large numbers of broadwings make them <b>highly vulnerable</b> on their migration journey. Many may not survive, and more than half of all juveniles will perish. The dangers they face include:</p>
<p>*Human persecution<br/>*Industrial wind farms<br/>*Pesticides and other environmental contaminants<br/>*Lack of forest roosting habitat<br/>*Hurricanes and other natural threats</p>
<p><strong>Challenges in Pennsylvania and the Tropics:</strong><br/>Broadwings need large forests to nest and in Pennsylvania, the birds are leaving southern counties and other places as forests disappear. Little is known about habitat use during migration or wintering periods, but deforestation of Neotropics may also limit roost sites, providing yet another challenge to weary migrants.</p>
<p><strong>Work to Date<br/></strong>In the 2014 pilot year, we collected detailed observations and video on four nests to identify prey and quantify parental care in Appalachian forest. We placed four satellite transmitters on three juveniles and one adult Broad-winged Hawk which are now being tracked at our website, see <a href=""http://www.hawkmountain.org/birdtracker"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.hawkmountain.org/birdtracker</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Interesting Findings</strong><br/>In 2014, the adult female we tagged immediately departed after her young left the nest, leaving the male to bring food and protect the recently fledged young. Is her behavior typical of female birds or just an anomaly? We don't know  without tagging additional adults.  In 2014, two of the juveniles we tagged were from one nest, but the birds did not migrate together although they did move along parallel tracks.  We need to mark additional juveniles to see if nest mates will stay together after fledging and during migration.</p>
<p><i><b>Your support is vital to completing this exciting project successfully</b></i>.  We  must match funds donated through the Pennsylvania Game Commission, dollar for dollar, with private donations or Hawk Mountain funds.  In 2015, we need to raise funding for two or more transmitters and for two additional field personnel to  locate and observe  nests,  We  also need funding to pay our graduate student and contract tree climbers as the nest trees are often quite high and the nest difficult to access. </p>

<br/><h3><b>Why Broad-winged Hawks?</b></h3>
<p>The Broad-winged Hawk nests in large, unbroken forests of eastern and central North America. Each autumn they vacate North America and travel thousands of miles to winter in Central and South America. Although highly secretive and rarely seen during nesting, broadwings are conspicuous on migration, forming impressively large flocks, numbering thousands of birds. Nearly the entire world's population will pass through eastern Mexico and Central America on their way to southern wintering areas.</p>
<p><b>                 <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/200124/files/20131115115936-File0004-A.jpg?1384545576"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p>
<p>Because of their amazing concentration, broadwings  face multiple threats during migration and on the wintering grounds, including shooting, deforestation, and contaminants. Moreover, despite the abundance of data on migration numbers recorded by hawkwatchers in North America, very little is known about their habitat use, migration, wintering and nesting behavior, and their conservation threats. Such data are critical to the long-term conservation of this iconic migrant and its migration spectacle.</p>
<p><b><b>The Broad-winged Hawk Project has three main goals:</b></b></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Identify Broad-winged Hawk migration routes and migration behavior in autumn and spring, identify the stop-over and over-wintering sites, overall range, and habitat used during migration and winter periods.</b></li>
<li><b>Compare nesting behavior, migration patterns and timing of birds from within the same nest and from nests of the same region, including departure and arrival times, distance traveled daily, migration routes, and wintering region.</b></li>
<li><b>With data gathered, publish and publicize results, work with government officials, local residents, and conservation organizations across the regions used by the birds to protect critical migration and wintering habitats. </b></li>
</ol>
<p>Hawk Mountain also intends to use the project as a tool to educate the public on the value and beauty of Broad-winged Hawks and other long-distance migrants.

<p>August through November 2015: Track ten  Broad-winged Hawks as they migrate south through North America, Mexico, Central America and possibly South America. Routes and locations will be mapped online and shared with schools, general public, and donors. </p>
<p>Winter 2015-2016: The wintering range of each bird will be mapped, and in spring we will follow birds as they return north, assessing where they choose to spend their first winter and measuring how fast they migrate and other factors.

Check out the ""Select a perk"" section on the right-hand side of the page for a full listing of donor levels and benefits.
If the project goal of $30,400 is not met, all funds will be applied to cover vital project costs, although less nests and birds may be followed.
The Impact
Although the Broad-winged Hawk can be observed by the thousands during their migration, little is known about their ecology and conservation needs.  As deforestation continues throughout its range and other potential threats heighten, it is important we understand more about its biology and ecology throughout its life cycle.
Hawk Mountain Sanctuary is well-suited to successfully implement this exciting project. We are a non-profit organization with a mission of conserving raptors worldwide and an 80-year history of successful wildlife conservation and outreach (see www.hawkmountain.org). We manage 2,500 acres of Appalachian forest and host education programs for 70,000 visitors annually. Our successful international conservation science trainee program boasts more than 300 graduates across the world, who in turn offer global collaboration for the outreach component of this project. We have former trainees in nearly every country traversed by broadwings. In the past decade, we have tracked Black and Turkey Vultures across similar landscapes and shared data through online and print publications.

<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>
<p>The immediate goal of SEASMART is to transform the marine aquarium trade, first in the Philippines and then on an international scale. This industry right now is predominately a high volume, low value, price driven industry with little regard for fishers or for the environment. SEASMART is capable of changing this.  It is our intention to help transform the marine aquarium trade into a force for the global conservation, restoration and sustainable use of the world’s precious coral reefs. SEASMART will help to lay the ecosystem, resource and community-based management foundations for the sustainable use of all fisheries within a management area further expanding SEASMART’s management and marketing benefits at little additional cost.</p>
<p>Without the adoption of sustainable management systems put in place through a transformative process, many reef spawning grounds will be harmed beyond repair, fishers and their coastal communities will decline further economically, and the purchasing public will have access to fewer, less affordable fish. Your funding support will permit EcoEZ SEASMART to take its Papua New Guinea pilot to the next level. With this proposed Stage 2 project, SEASMART will scale up its tested methodologies and evaluation systems as it seeks high rates of adoption by fishers. The initiative will provide guidance and affirmation that the SEASMART approach is replicable, is scalable, and can have global positive economic and environmental impacts.  SEASMART Marine Aquarium Life is Sustainable, Equitable, Profitable, and Affordable.</p>
<p><strong>Our main project objectives are to:  </strong></p>
<p>1) protect and sustainably manage reefs through a public-private sector approach to the marine aquarium trade;</p>
<p>2) enable historically marginalized fisher households to earn substantially higher incomes through first-time ownership and management of their marine aquarium trade;</p>
<p>3) improve awareness and demand for ecofriendly branded marine aquarium practices and products; and</p>
<p>4)  supply affordable, healthy marine aquarium fish and corals to consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Some of our anticipated results  are: </strong></p>
<p>1) widespread adoption of ecologically sustainable fish and coral harvesting best practices via coastal communities ownership;</p>
<p>2) sustainable SEASMART management systems are operational and succeeding;</p>
<p>3) increased number of hectares of marine habitat, number of species of marine life, and hectares of protected areas under management;  </p>
<p>4) marine aquarium buyers expand purchases of SEASMART-sourced marine aquarium life; and</p>
<p>5) substantially higher incomes among primary beneficiaries (fishers, coral farmers, and reef restorers) and secondary beneficiaries (packers, trainers, drivers)</p>
<p>Please join us on this adventure to one of the most beautiful and diverse places on earth in an effort to protect, conserve, and restore these irreplaceable coral reef habitats, usher in a new way of life for these coastal peoples along with a higher standard of living, and bring a much-needed paradigm shift to the concept of true sustainability. We look forward to bringing a sustainable, equitable, and profitable marine aquarium trade to the Philippines and hope that our collective goals develop into a successful partnership that we feel is waiting just beneath the waves.</p>
<p><strong>Why are Coral Reefs so Important?</strong></p>
<p>The Coral Triangle (CT) covers approximately 2.3 million square miles of ocean and encompasses six countries in the Indo-Pacific: Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, the Solomon Islands, and Timor-Leste. An unbelievable amount of biodiversity is condensed into less than 1% of the world's ocean surface area: The CT is home to one-third of the world’s coral reefs, 75% of known coral species (~600 species of corals), nearly 3,000 species of fish, half of the world’s seagrass and marine mollusk species, 75% of known mangrove species, six of the world’s seven species of marine turtles, and more than 22 species of marine mammals. We would like to focus our attention on the most northern point of this triangle, the Philippines, a place that, according to leading authorities in the taxonomy world, contains “the center of the center of marine biodiversity”.</p>
<p><strong>Why did SEASMART choose the Philippines for Stage 2 Expansion?</strong></p>
<p>The Philippines is comprised of 7, 107 islands and is a place of remarkable diversity and immeasurable importance that is considered top priority for conservation along with the Amazon, Arctic, Galapagos Islands and Madagascar. SEASMART proposes to help conserve this oasis of life by sustainably developing a trade that this place is uniquely equipped to support: the marine aquarium trade.  The SEASMART program will operate in the Philippines with the sole agenda of developing a sustainable, equitable, and profitable marine aquarium trade that would benefit all involved. SEASMART would give coastal inhabitants the opportunity to abandon destructive fishing practices such as fishing with dynamite and cyanide that yield immediate but detrimental results, for a livelihood that fosters sustainable development and proper management of an immeasurably important natural resource. </p>
<p><strong>Why is the Marine Aquarium Trade Important to the Future of the World’s Coral Reefs?</strong></p>
<p>UNEP estimates that global trade in marine aquarium fish and coral is $200-330 million annually, mostly in sales to some 2 million marine aquarium owners primarily in the U.S. and Europe. The trade provides income for tens of thousands of local fishers and a substantial source of foreign exchange to poor countries, yet fishers are routinely exploited and their environments are often degraded beyond repair. Most marine aquarium organisms are not harvested sustainably or in ways that benefit local communities, fishers or buyers. </p>
<p><strong>What are the Problems that SEASMART Fixes?</strong></p>
<p>In the Philippines and Indonesia, where 85% of the world's supply of live products are sourced, most exporters and wholesalers have little regard for coastal communities or interest in sound environmental stewardship. Local fishers are paid little and have virtually no ownership, control, or say in an industry that is characterized by a high loss rate from collection methods that employ cyanide and other chemicals to stun fish for capture. The U.S. and Europe may ban imports unless fish and coral are proven to be from sustainably managed sources. If bans are imposed, the result would be economic catastrophe for local fishers and their communities. The importing countries are concerned over the lack of science-based fishery area management plans, destructive fishing practices, and trade in endangered species.</p>
<p>Without sound reef management, the very resource needed to sustain the trade and produce fair prices and income for fishers, could be depleted permanently. SEASMART strives to ensure that this fate does not befall the world’s coral reefs. The marine aquarium trade can be managed in economically sustainable and environmentally sound ways as a supplier of healthy fish and coral to consumers. UNEP claims that the marine aquarium trade has the highest potential to provide sustainable resource management and economic prosperity to coastal communities.</p>
<p>When ecosystems are protected and managed properly, the marine life proliferates and monetary value is added to an area, making it even more desirable to conserve. Investing in SEASMART offers a unique opportunity to drive global change starting with the marine aquarium trade. This trade faces growing threats to its future, and the SEASMART program is truly a force for the global conservation, protection, and sustainable use of the world’s coral reefs and associated ecosystems.</p>
<p>EcoEZ's SEASMART approach overcomes destructive imbalances in the trade's value chain through branded, innovative, practical solutions. Its Papua New Guinea SEASMART pilot improved protection of reefs through a profit-driven approach: incomes rose among first-time ownership by historically marginalized households and demand for ecofriendly marine practices and products also grew. Further testing can show widespread impact, scalability and replicability. SEASMART fish are healthy and sustainably caught with no chemicals using only hand nets, providing customers confidence that their fish are collected, handled and shipped in accordance with best practices through the efforts of fisher-owners and dedicated exporters such as our partner company, SeaStrong.</p>
<p><strong>How Will We Accomplish these Goals?</strong></p>
<p>SEASMART’s mission is to establish a marine aquarium fishery in the Philippines that is sustainable, equitable, and profitable and we can do this with the implementation of five key program components: Resource Assessment &amp; Management (RAM), Management Area Planning (MAP), Fisher and Fishery Development (FFD), Mariculture, Aquaculture &amp; Restoration (MAR), and SeaStrong (Export and Branding). Each one of these components is integral to the development of Fishery Management Areas (FMAs), geographically defined and resource mapped coastal marine areas whose boundaries are determined by traditional local community resource ownership or local government boundaries. </p>
<p>Sustainability is an absolute necessity for the success of a marine aquarium trade in the Philippines and all five of these components can make it a reality. SEASMART’s RAM programing has the ability to provide vital information on the abundance of a FMA’s marine aquarium resources, as well as data on food fish species, and the health of each FMA’s marine ecosystems. Our MAP development process results in a plan capable of growth and change depending on the current needs of an area, and is an essential step towards ensuring the sustainable management of fish stocks and reef health.  SEASMART’s FFD programming provides fishers and fisher communities training in correct fishing, holding, handling, and husbandry techniques and management. Our MAR programming is primarily an activity run by women that provides coral farmer training in coral cultivation methods and reef restoration, and is worth half of the trade’s potential value. SeaStrong programming provides the necessary organism traceability, husbandry, shipping, and marketing needed to maintain the SEASMART goal of a less than 1% organism mortality rate, an extremely low number considering the industry average is between 15-35%. All these components will ensure that the Philippines’ priceless natural resources are protected, conserved, and restored where necessary.</p>
<p>We are dividing our funding efforts into two phases in order to better manage the immediate v. future needs of the SEASMART project by ensuring that each need is met in the necessary order.</p>
<p><strong>Phase One:  Site Preparation - $75,000</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resource Assessment &amp; Management (RAM)</strong></li>
</ul><p>The RAM component conducts the resource assessment of applicant FMA communities; coordinates and trains fishers and locals on resource management; produces Total Allowable Catch (TAC) values for every marine aquarium species surveyed; coordinates with Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) GIS personnel on FMA mapping; evaluates potential sites; provides data to TRADE Management database; identifies suggested no-take areas; and develops FMA site-specific “non suitable species” or “no-take” lists for endangered, rare, dangerous, or inappropriate species. Inappropriate species are those that don’t do well in captivity or shipping, eat corals, or have living requirements that make them unsuitable for aquarium living.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Management Area Planning (MAP)</strong></li>
</ul><p>The MAP component leads the development of an FMA community’s Management Area Plan; coordinates with all SEASMART Divisions to ensure implementation of site assessment recommendations; coordinates and trains local FMA MAP Committees; assists in MAP certification process; coordinates implementation of certification corrective action plans with regards to MAP development; and monitors and evaluates potential sites for future selection.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fisher &amp; Fishery Development (FFD)</strong></li>
</ul><p>The FFD component provides fisher skills training and extension in marine aquarium organism identification, habitat, lifecycle, capture, handling, holding, husbandry and transport; ecosystem conservation and harvest area rotation; fisheries management planning and implementation; Fisher Training and Extension Manual development and adaption; fisher association development and management; and fisher preparation for Marine Aquarium Council (MAC) or equivalent certification.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mariculture, Aquaculture and Restoration (MAR)</strong></li>
</ul><p>The MAR component provides fisher skills training and extension on in situ cultivation of coral species primarily to women that allows them to have a major role in generating income for their families. Different methodologies of coral cultivation are trialed including methods that also act as vehicles for reef restoration such as the use of low cost, community produced Coral &amp; Fish Aggregation Devices (CFADs). The focus will be on producing market quality corals with fairly easy reach of the coral-farming managers (primarily community women).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Phase Two: SeaStrong - $75,000 </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Export Facility Development (EFD)</strong></li>
</ul><p>The EFD component supports the development of export facilities including screening, transport, holding, handling, husbandry, packing, and shipping as well as promotion and marketing assistance for the export of product.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smart Business Development (SBD)</strong></li>
</ul><p>The SBD component provides fisher skills training and extension in small business development; personal financial management training; fisher banking and bank account set-up (paperless and cashless payment system); and support for application to lending institutions and Government managed development funds in support of their marine aquarium fishing activities.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TRADE Management Database-Traceability Systems</strong></li>
</ul><p>The TMD component supports the development and implementation of TRADE Management Software ensuring all product traceability mechanisms are functional and robust.</p>

<p>And a few notes on donation:</p>
<p>We have a lot of great perks that you can buy, but there is of course always the option of buying the perk just for the sake of donating to our cause. If you don’t feel like you want/need any of the items you bought, we certainly won’t be offended. Donating just because you truly believe in something is probably the greatest reward of all. We also don’t expect everyone to be able to donate, but if you think you know someone who would be interested in our campaign, please tell them about us!</p>
<p>If you decide to contribute and you do it via PayPal, you will see that you'll be transferred to the site of a sister organization, Panda Mountain (they love corals too!). Rest assured that your funds will be going to us at SEASMART; we are currently sharing a PayPal page with them becasue it's easier for both of us. Also, if you use PayPal instead of a credit card, the funds are availbale to us quickly. <span>The Team wants to start work right away, and you make this possible by paying through PayPal.</span></p>
<p><span>If you happen to be a marine aquarium hobbyist or industry contributor, we are offering the option of converting your real dollars and perks into “fish dollars”. 25% of the money you donate over $50 could be “redeemed” and essentially converted into fish purchases as animals become available over the next year.</span></p>

When ecosystems are protected and managed properly, the marine life proliferates and monetary value is added to an area, making it even more desirable to conserve. Investing in SEASMART offers a unique opportunity to drive global change starting with the marine aquarium trade. This trade faces growing threats to its future, and the SEASMART program is truly a force for the global conservation, protection, and sustainable use of the world’s coral reefs and associated ecosystems.
EcoEZ's SEASMART approach overcomes destructive imbalances in the trade's value chain through branded, innovative, practical solutions. Its Papua New Guinea SEASMART pilot improved protection of reefs through a profit-driven approach: incomes rose among first-time ownership by historically marginalized households and demand for ecofriendly marine practices and products also grew. Further testing can show widespread impact, scalability and replicability. SEASMART fish are healthy and sustainably caught with no chemicals using only hand nets, providing customers confidence that their fish are collected, handled and shipped in accordance with best practices through the efforts of fisher-owners and dedicated exporters such as our partner company, SeaStrong.
How Will We Accomplish these Goals?
SEASMART’s mission is to establish a marine aquarium fishery in the Philippines that is sustainable, equitable, and profitable and we can do this with the implementation of five key program components: Resource Assessment & Management (RAM), Management Area Planning (MAP), Fisher and Fishery Development (FFD), Mariculture, Aquaculture & Restoration (MAR), and SeaStrong (Export and Branding). Each one of these components is integral to the development of Fishery Management Areas (FMAs), geographically defined and resource mapped coastal marine areas whose boundaries are determined by traditional local community resource ownership or local government boundaries. 
Sustainability is an absolute necessity for the success of a marine aquarium trade in the Philippines and all five of these components can make it a reality. SEASMART’s RAM programing has the ability to provide vital information on the abundance of a FMA’s marine aquarium resources, as well as data on food fish species, and the health of each FMA’s marine ecosystems. Our MAP development process results in a plan capable of growth and change depending on the current needs of an area, and is an essential step towards ensuring the sustainable management of fish stocks and reef health.  SEASMART’s FFD programming provides fishers and fisher communities training in correct fishing, holding, handling, and husbandry techniques and management. Our MAR programming is primarily an activity run by women that provides coral farmer training in coral cultivation methods and reef restoration, and is worth half of the trade’s potential value. SeaStrong programming provides the necessary organism traceability, husbandry, shipping, and marketing needed to maintain the SEASMART goal of a less than 1% organism mortality rate, an extremely low number considering the industry average is between 15-35%. All these components will ensure that the Philippines’ priceless natural resources are protected, conserved, and restored where necessary.
We are dividing our funding efforts into two phases in order to better manage the immediate v. future needs of the SEASMART project by ensuring that each need is met in the necessary order.
Phase One:  Site Preparation - $75,000

Resource Assessment & Management (RAM)
The RAM component conducts the resource assessment of applicant FMA communities; coordinates and trains fishers and locals on resource management; produces Total Allowable Catch (TAC) values for every marine aquarium species surveyed; coordinates with Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) GIS personnel on FMA mapping; evaluates potential sites; provides data to TRADE Management database; identifies suggested no-take areas; and develops FMA site-specific “non suitable species” or “no-take” lists for endangered, rare, dangerous, or inappropriate species. Inappropriate species are those that don’t do well in captivity or shipping, eat corals, or have living requirements that make them unsuitable for aquarium living.

Management Area Planning (MAP)
The MAP component leads the development of an FMA community’s Management Area Plan; coordinates with all SEASMART Divisions to ensure implementation of site assessment recommendations; coordinates and trains local FMA MAP Committees; assists in MAP certification process; coordinates implementation of certification corrective action plans with regards to MAP development; and monitors and evaluates potential sites for future selection.

Fisher & Fishery Development (FFD)
The FFD component provides fisher skills training and extension in marine aquarium organism identification, habitat, lifecycle, capture, handling, holding, husbandry and transport; ecosystem conservation and harvest area rotation; fisheries management planning and implementation; Fisher Training and Extension Manual development and adaption; fisher association development and management; and fisher preparation for Marine Aquarium Council (MAC) or equivalent certification.

Mariculture, Aquaculture and Restoration (MAR)
The MAR component provides fisher skills training and extension on in situ cultivation of coral species primarily to women that allows them to have a major role in generating income for their families. Different methodologies of coral cultivation are trialed including methods that also act as vehicles for reef restoration such as the use of low cost, community produced Coral & Fish Aggregation Devices (CFADs). The focus will be on producing market quality corals with fairly easy reach of the coral-farming managers (primarily community women).
 
Phase Two: SeaStrong - $75,000 

Export Facility Development (EFD)
The EFD component supports the development of export facilities including screening, transport, holding, handling, husbandry, packing, and shipping as well as promotion and marketing assistance for the export of product.

Smart Business Development (SBD)
The SBD component provides fisher skills training and extension in small business development; personal financial management training; fisher banking and bank account set-up (paperless and cashless payment system); and support for application to lending institutions and Government managed development funds in support of their marine aquarium fishing activities.

TRADE Management Database-Traceability Systems
The TMD component supports the development and implementation of TRADE Management Software ensuring all product traceability mechanisms are functional and robust.
 
And a few notes on donation:
We have a lot of great perks that you can buy, but there is of course always the option of buying the perk just for the sake of donating to our cause. If you don’t feel like you want/need any of the items you bought, we certainly won’t be offended. Donating just because you truly believe in something is probably the greatest reward of all. We also don’t expect everyone to be able to donate, but if you think you know someone who would be interested in our campaign, please tell them about us!
If you decide to contribute and you do it via PayPal, you will see that you'll be transferred to the site of a sister organization, Panda Mountain (they love corals too!). Rest assured that your funds will be going to us at SEASMART; we are currently sharing a PayPal page with them becasue it's easier for both of us. Also, if you use PayPal instead of a credit card, the funds are availbale to us quickly. The Team wants to start work right away, and you make this possible by paying through PayPal.
If you happen to be a marine aquarium hobbyist or industry contributor, we are offering the option of converting your real dollars and perks into “fish dollars”. 25% of the money you donate over $50 could be “redeemed” and essentially converted into fish purchases as animals become available over the next year.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>Save the Vrain Regional Park Effort</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Save The Vrain</em> is a Colorado non-profit corporation whose sole purpose is to create a regional park and preserve 817 acres of beautiful ranchland with a unique ecosystem. This proposed regional park already has a rail trail waiting to be constructed which will connect the town of Firestone to Milliken, Platteville, and beyond. The ranch is home to nesting bald eagles, a heron rookery, many birds and wild animals; and the St. Vrain River which meanders within it's boundaries. </p>
</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Our goal is to make this regional park into a world-class park with walking, bicycle and equestrian trails, as well as canoe trips up and down the river. What better way than to have the partnership of The Greenway Foundation to assist us in finding the right people, and organizations for donations and/or grants that will help us in this endeavor. </li>
</ul><ul>
<li>We are a group of citizens that consist of 150 neighbors of the ranch and beyond.  Some of us are 3rd, 4th, and even 5th generation ranchers. We have naturalists, bird enthusiasts, businessmen and women, oil and gas professionals, cattlemen, farmers, environmentalists, and more.  What makes our group unique is the breadth of background we bring! </li>
</ul><ul>
<li>We have already led a successful effort to protect the property from being turned into a gun range!  It was slated to be built 900 feet from the Kurtz Ranch bald eagle's nest, which is illegal. But, this is not enough.  The property is still for sale and could be developed into any number of uses.  We believe that the neighboring towns would greatly benefit from a regional park! The towns of Mead, Platteville, and Milliken already have given their support to this effort.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<p>The ranch is 4 miles from Mead and Platteville, 5 miles from Firestone, 7 miles from Johnstown, and 9 miles from Milliken. It is easily accessible as it is east of I-25 at Exit 243; approximately 4-miles due east at the intersection of County Road 17 and Colorado State Highway 66, in Weld County, Colorado. The proposed regional park would be on the Northeast corner of CR 17.</p>
</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<p>We are partnering with The Greenway Foundation; the firm that reclaimed, restored and revitalized over ten miles of the South Platte River, a portion of which is now known as Confluence Park in Denver, Colorado. The Greenway Foundation has a world-wide reputation and has led efforts with over 20+ parks and natural areas and has constructed more than 100 miles of hiking and biking trails. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The area surrounding the proposed park includes the fastest growing communities in Colorado, with five small towns surrounding the ranch.  This rapid urbanization has not included an opportunity to recreate and enjoy all that a large park has to offer.  The trail on an abandoned rail bed will connect the communities.  The park is approximately two miles long and a mile wide. The St. Vrain River winds through it, providing a variety of recreational activity, while also providing habitat for a wide range of birds and animals.</p>
<p>The Platte River Greenway is generally recognized as one of the premier trail systems in the country.  The principals of that effort are heading the efforts to secure the funds to purchase this almost pristine Ranch and develop it to its highest and best use: a regional park.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>An Art Film on Climate Change<br/>Because  Traditional Documentaries on Climate Change<br/>Have Not Made A Big Difference<br/>Coming in 2020</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.climatediscovery.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Climate Change Now Initiative (nonprofit 501c3)</a> is the oldest independent climate science education organization in the world (EIN 90-1006128.) Founded in 2005, we do things a little differently. And now, four years in the making, we've upped the ante on this film.</p>
<p>We've put together a team. We have a new Executive Producer with a substantial philanthropic donation. We have a new film production, post production, and creative professional to guide, implement and polish. We now have academic, political and cultural resources. This is big. It has to be. There is no planet B.</p>
<p>It's obvious. Past climate science education strategies have not worked out so well. The new science of global warming psychology says we have to create learning through pathways that are different from our old left brain strategies because, the old pathways have been corrupted by money, propaganda, fear, and good sounding ideas that are just not good sound ideas.</p>
<p>This idea of right brain learning is not new. Mr. Rodgers was doing it 55 years ago. Right brain learning uses more of the brain to create deeper thought --emotional thought-- that is more meaningful, more powerful. </p>
<p>Even better, we can hear the message through the lyrics in music. Think about the blues. The blues are all bad, but we enjoy the blues as music. Blues are catchy, melodic, and rhythmic. It plays on our inner psychology. We can relate. The blues are perfect for climate change.</p>
<p>This film will not just be another climate documentary. It's an art film -- with the capacity to make a much bigger difference than those traditional left brain strategies that just haven't worked out so well.</p>
<p>So here we are with our cameras and music, with 27,700 miles in the can and 15,000 coming up, and a big new motivated team.  We are ready to usher in a new era of climate change outreach, and we need your help.</p>

</h3>
<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>It takes place across the spine of North America from Mexico to the Canadian Rockies; from Padre Island to the Outer Banks via Key West; From the California disasters to the Arctic Ocean and Greenland. Global warming psychology says right brain learning comes from stories. This story is about some of the most beautiful and breathtaking landscapes in the world. It's an uncomplicated film, fresh and natural, designed not to frighten but to please. </p>
<p>It's a story of normal environmental changes that happen every time our climate changes abruptly. It's as beautiful as only the natural world can be, and it's fascinating because nobody has ever seen abrupt changes taking place.</p>
<p>The most exciting part of the story is music. The lyrics carry more water than the narrative. And the narrative: who knew that high altitude forests across North America are now emitting more greenhouse gases than they absorb because of 96 million acres of forest mortality caused by native beetles?  Or that Alaska, because of permafrost melt, is now a net emitter of greenhouse gases? Or that sea level rise is now eroding into the dunes on wild barrier island beaches across America up to 20 times per year during normal twice-yearly maximum high tides?</p>
<p>The best ""who knew"" however, is that we can remove the already emitted carbon dioxide from our sky using treatment techniques first used to keep our sailors safe from carbon dioxide poisoning in submarines during WW II. These normal pollution treatment strategies are very similar in technology and cost to those used to ensuring safe drinking water across the planet every year. </p>
<p>This new healthy climate film is different. It's not frightening. It's not about giving things up. It's about our energy infrastructure already being on the best-case scenario pathway of emissions reductions because of ultra-cheap wind, solar and batteries. It's about the solutions that create a better world, a world where we can actually reduce warming AND create a fossil carbon free energy infrastructure.</p>

<h3>What Your Donations Will Pay For</h3>
<p>This is our fourth year of filming for this project. We netted about $4,000 from our <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/climate-change-across-america-music-film/x/16784909#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Indiegogo last year</a>, (Yay!) But it wasn't enough and we had to put last year's West Coast trip on hold. But it's a new filming season and along with last year's donations—California to the Arctic Ocean filming begins June 25.</p>
<p>It's not cheap, even for a low budget production that camps the whole way. Our director pays for almost everything out of his own pocket and this year the Ice Melter (see below) has 198,000 miles on it. The repair list is long, but it beats buying a new one and modding it for 4x4 work with high altitude and desert trails, and grueling beach work. Our director has spent $15,500 on maintenance beginning about 2015. Hopefully these expenditures will last a few seasons. </p>

<h3>The Schedule:</h3>
<p>It's not likely we will get to post production until next year (post production is the computer studio part of making a film). We still have to do the East Coast wild beach erosion tour, plus a new trip to Greenland. We were last in Greenland in 2007 and are really looking forward to repeat photography there with melt that has only accelerated.  This winter we'll do a couple of new videos (see our latest videos below.)</p>
<p>There's still a chance we can get to post production this year if we can get enough folks to share this Indiegogo! We return from the Arctic Ocean early/mid-August and Greenland's peak filming season is late August. Then we can finish with the coastal work in October/November during the King Tide. Post production this year will mean film festival applications in early 2019. Otherwise, it's the 2020 film festival season.</p>

An Art Film on Climate ChangeBecause  Traditional Documentaries on Climate ChangeHave Not Made A Big DifferenceComing in 2020
 
The Climate Change Now Initiative (nonprofit 501c3) is the oldest independent climate science education organization in the world (EIN 90-1006128.) Founded in 2005, we do things a little differently. And now, four years in the making, we've upped the ante on this film.
We've put together a team. We have a new Executive Producer with a substantial philanthropic donation. We have a new film production, post production, and creative professional to guide, implement and polish. We now have academic, political and cultural resources. This is big. It has to be. There is no planet B.
It's obvious. Past climate science education strategies have not worked out so well. The new science of global warming psychology says we have to create learning through pathways that are different from our old left brain strategies because, the old pathways have been corrupted by money, propaganda, fear, and good sounding ideas that are just not good sound ideas.
This idea of right brain learning is not new. Mr. Rodgers was doing it 55 years ago. Right brain learning uses more of the brain to create deeper thought --emotional thought-- that is more meaningful, more powerful. 
Even better, we can hear the message through the lyrics in music. Think about the blues. The blues are all bad, but we enjoy the blues as music. Blues are catchy, melodic, and rhythmic. It plays on our inner psychology. We can relate. The blues are perfect for climate change.
This film will not just be another climate documentary. It's an art film -- with the capacity to make a much bigger difference than those traditional left brain strategies that just haven't worked out so well.
So here we are with our cameras and music, with 27,700 miles in the can and 15,000 coming up, and a big new motivated team.  We are ready to usher in a new era of climate change outreach, and we need your help.
Climate Change Across America
 ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
Your small contributions can make a big difference,because this film will be unique.
Help us make this effort a success,for all mankind. 



The Story
It takes place across the spine of North America from Mexico to the Canadian Rockies; from Padre Island to the Outer Banks via Key West; From the California disasters to the Arctic Ocean and Greenland. Global warming psychology says right brain learning comes from stories. This story is about some of the most beautiful and breathtaking landscapes in the world. It's an uncomplicated film, fresh and natural, designed not to frighten but to please. 
It's a story of normal environmental changes that happen every time our climate changes abruptly. It's as beautiful as only the natural world can be, and it's fascinating because nobody has ever seen abrupt changes taking place.
The most exciting part of the story is music. The lyrics carry more water than the narrative. And the narrative: who knew that high altitude forests across North America are now emitting more greenhouse gases than they absorb because of 96 million acres of forest mortality caused by native beetles?  Or that Alaska, because of permafrost melt, is now a net emitter of greenhouse gases? Or that sea level rise is now eroding into the dunes on wild barrier island beaches across America up to 20 times per year during normal twice-yearly maximum high tides?
The best ""who knew"" however, is that we can remove the already emitted carbon dioxide from our sky using treatment techniques first used to keep our sailors safe from carbon dioxide poisoning in submarines during WW II. These normal pollution treatment strategies are very similar in technology and cost to those used to ensuring safe drinking water across the planet every year. 
This new healthy climate film is different. It's not frightening. It's not about giving things up. It's about our energy infrastructure already being on the best-case scenario pathway of emissions reductions because of ultra-cheap wind, solar and batteries. It's about the solutions that create a better world, a world where we can actually reduce warming AND create a fossil carbon free energy infrastructure.

What Your Donations Will Pay For
This is our fourth year of filming for this project. We netted about $4,000 from our Indiegogo last year, (Yay!) But it wasn't enough and we had to put last year's West Coast trip on hold. But it's a new filming season and along with last year's donations—California to the Arctic Ocean filming begins June 25.
It's not cheap, even for a low budget production that camps the whole way. Our director pays for almost everything out of his own pocket and this year the Ice Melter (see below) has 198,000 miles on it. The repair list is long, but it beats buying a new one and modding it for 4x4 work with high altitude and desert trails, and grueling beach work. Our director has spent $15,500 on maintenance beginning about 2015. Hopefully these expenditures will last a few seasons. 
The ""Ice Melter"" is a good mini-RV and can go where no RV or town car ever dreamed, usually. At 14 MPG, gas for California to the Arctic Ocean will run about $3200.
Cams: Cameras don't last forever and this year we have replaced about half our fleet. The total bill for cams: north of $5k. The same goes for our HD film work station. Our 2011 ""historic"" model is showing major signs of degradation; $1500 in repairs in 2017 and 2018, and a new one will be needed in the fall.  
The Band's mixer will also get replaced this fall to begin work on rerecording many of our old tunes. And Yay! The band will be carrying the bulk of the mixer burden. These are just the big things. Camping fees for example, at 7 weeks and $20 a day, is another $1,000. It all adds up. 

 
The Schedule:
It's not likely we will get to post production until next year (post production is the computer studio part of making a film). We still have to do the East Coast wild beach erosion tour, plus a new trip to Greenland. We were last in Greenland in 2007 and are really looking forward to repeat photography there with melt that has only accelerated.  This winter we'll do a couple of new videos (see our latest videos below.)
There's still a chance we can get to post production this year if we can get enough folks to share this Indiegogo! We return from the Arctic Ocean early/mid-August and Greenland's peak filming season is late August. Then we can finish with the coastal work in October/November during the King Tide. Post production this year will mean film festival applications in early 2019. Otherwise, it's the 2020 film festival season.

The Band Climate Change

The band got started in 2001 as just another non-gigging Austin therapy group (these groups are pretty thick in Austin). By 2007, Melton was writing climate songs (an engineer singer song writer...) and had taken over the lead singer position. They have self published three albums. The band has a studio concert just about every Friday and plays a few special gigs a year. Drop by any time. Use the band entrance around back. If the house is a rockin, don't bother knockin, come on in ~ ~ ~ Left to right above: George Hadash - lead guitar, Philip Fulton - bass, Bruce Melton - rhythm guitar, harmonica, Ken Atwater - drums, Tom Williams - keys, everybody sings.

The so-called Green Revolution, that saw most of Indian agriculture undergo radical changes in the seventies and eighties of the last century, has had a severe impact on the environment and the socio-economic and cultural situation of people, especially in rural areas. Madanapalle, the project region, is an important center for agricultural products and famous for producing tomatoes, mangos, groundnuts and silk. In Andhra Pradesh, like in other Indian states, facing the hopeless reality of debt, scarce workforce and highly fluctuating market prices, many small-scale farmers choose suicide as the last way out. Climate change has a negative impact on this semi-arid area with increasingly absent rainfalls. Extreme heat, dry soil and water shortage reduce crop productivity and demand more resources. The groundwater level has gone down dramatically in recent years. At this moment, more than 60% of the borewells have dried up and most villages are without secure water supply.</p><p>Another core issue is the dependence on hybrid seeds and chemicals.

In addition to ecological agroforestry, Toranam plans to pioneer an e-learning approach to agricultural and environmental education, which is new in the region, to engage with young people with an affinity to technology.The demonstration farm is already being set up as well as the e-learning center. The next step is now to set up processing facilities and actively involve farmers.Agroforestry and processingAgroforestry is a technique where trees are integrated on farmlands in a systematic manner. The trees provide shade, nutrition, biomass and several other benefits to the crops as well as produce that can be converted to value added products. To demonstrate the model for sustainable development, pilot plots with organic agroforestry are established on various farmlands. The pilot plots are designed to be well-adapted to local socio-ecological conditions and climatic mutability. From these locations, a farmer’s cooperative is set to be established with purchase guarantees from Toranam for all produce they harvest with the newly established organic agroforestry.Value addition will be achieved through processing of those crops. It will create a system with increased shelf life and participating farmers will be able to sell their produce for a fixed and fair price independently from the market. The center will also offer eco tourism facilities for additional income generation.This holistic approach will not only benefit the farmers directly, but also tackle the issue of climate change and water scarcity. Through the plantation of trees and better water management on farmlands, effects of climate change will be mitigated, and climate resilient systems can be developed.The Impact and our goalsThe main groups profiting from Toranam are small farmers, students and consumers longing for healthy produce from regional and traceable cultivation. Smallholder farmers can achieve better, diversified yields and hence a more stable income and can emancipate themselves from the chokehold of large agrochemical companies as well as loan sharks. Schools and students also benefit from the Environmental Education Center where soft skills and green business ideas can be developed.The success of this project means that the people can earn decent livelihoods instead of having to migrate to cities in search of petty jobs and live in subhuman conditions. It means that your contribution has aided in helping a village transition to a sustainable and climate resilient type of farming, which is the need of the hour. The effects of climate change are being felt everywhere now and it is the poor and the downtrodden that is the most vulnerable to these changes. As privileged human beings, it becomes our moral imperative to make an effort towards helping those in need.Risks & ChallengesThe primary hurdle that we currently face and will face in the future is the lack of rainfall in this region.The project team here at Toranam comprises of young local and international graduates who have pursued their studies in the field of sustainability, environmental planning, resource management. MORE is a local NGO with more than 30 years of experience in rural development.  We also have a volunteering structure where we accept students to do internships or write their research papers in context to the project we’re working on. This allows us to document the information well and offers new insights to any problem through detailed field research work.To minimize the risks associated with water shortage, we have successfully installed rainwater harvesting systems on every roof on the project site and are storing the rain water for the dry season. We are also applying traditional water catchment systems by using the slope of the lands and building trenches. We hold workshops with farmers where we display these systems to them and help them in implementing the same in their own lands.How your contribution will help With your help we will be able to set up processing units and facilities for eco-tourism to make the project economically independent. By processing locally, we will be adding much more value to the harvest compared to solely selling the harvest directly to the middlemen. Since our project is a social venture, we have decided to procure and use the processing machine within the farmer’s co-operative instead of owning it privately. This means that the processing units would be a common resource for the farmers who will work with us and cultivate organically. The profits made will cover the fixed costs such as salaries of local employees and exceeding profits will go back into the project with an aim of supporting more farmers.With your help and blessings, we can make this happen!",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

For two decades, The Watershed Center has been working to preserve one of the last best places in Addison County, a rare landscape of geological wonders, wild ponds, fertile bogs, stunning vistas, towering forests, and Native American archeological sites. The result has been a string of successes from the purchase of the original Waterworks woodlands to conservation of nearby Lost Pond Forest. Only one piece of this puzzle remains: a privately-owned 194-acre parcel that would link these two separate expanses and connect their trail systems to create a single education and conservation legacy nearly 1,000 acres strong. Now this parcel is for sale. But the clock is ticking. 
A Once-In-A-Lifetime OpportunityRecently the price for this land was cut to just $175 per acre, a remarkable bargain for such a beautiful and ecologically valuable place. This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity has just one hitch: We have only a few months to seal the deal. This land will be sold. But what happens then?Forever Wild or Forever Lost?In addition to linking the two separate woodlands of the Watershed Center, the “Middle Forest” hosts rare and endangered species like the eastern rat snake and the Indiana bat, uncommon vernal pools, hidden groves of legacy trees, and some of the region’s most scenic overlooks. New owners could log this forest’s old-growth trees, plow its meadow habitat, permit ATVs and other intrusive and destructive motorized uses, and manage it for consumption not conservation and education. Together we can create something better: a permanent public preserve that sets aside almost 1,000 pristine acres—over 7% of all the forest land in the Little Otter Creek Watershed—for teaching experiences, student exploration, community programs, hiking, and hunting. This is the Wildlands Project, and its fate is in our hands.Adopt an Acre. Be a Forestkeeper.For just $175, you can become a Forestkeeper and place an acre of the Middle Forest under the Watershed Center’s permanent stewardship. Or collect $17.50 from 10 friends and adopt an acre as a group. All Forestkeepers and groups will be honored on a commemorative plaque to be placed at the trailhead to the forest we’ll share. Big or small, every tax-deductible donation matters. Please give whatever you can to safeguard this priceless natural resource for future generations of explorers young and old. Every dollar counts! Every acre waits!Photo Prints taken by Jonathan Blake at the ""Middle Forest""NewtOwlAcornFlowerTree",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><span>A family forest and farm that has been owned by the same family since the  1940's is being threatened with development. After the conclusion of WWII, a former Navy veteran and his family purchased about 1000 acres of woodlands and hayfields. Through the years the operation of the farm was primarily for the benefit of the family (subsistence farming). They milked a few dairy cows and raised a few beef cows. They raised chickens for eggs and meat, planted a garden for fresh vegetables and canning for the winter months. Firewood was cut for heating the house and the firing up the cookstove. When cash was needed for taxes or other things, they would cut a few pine trees to sell to the mill. It was a sustainable farm. Over the last few years or so it seems that prices have risen so dramatically. Add to that fact the government seems to want more and more. Rising prices and higher taxes are not insurmountable problems. </span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><span>What is needed is a different approach to utilizing this wonderful gift. Instead of utilizing the land as a subsistence type of operation, what is necessary is to look for other operations that can allow the farm to continue intact. We have had a professional Forester develop a Forest Management Plan. We have received approval for a high tunnel by the USDA (greenhouse). This will allow us to extend the growing season by getting crops in the ground sooner as well as extending the harvest. The Forester has developed a plan to sustainably manage the forest to provide a better stream of income while managing the reforestation of the land. He has identified a stand of Sugar Maples from which we can begin to produce Maple Syrup for sale. We are working with the Upper Valley Land Trust to identify the opportunities for enacting any type(s) of conservation easment(s) that might be available to help conserve the land. We are working with Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) to explore the possibilities of the Wetlands Reserve Program (there are over 70 acres of wetlands that provide habitat for many types of birds, animals and amphibians) the land is home to many species of animals. There are deer, bear and moose, beaver, hawks and even Bald Eagles utilizing this habitat. We are continuing to explore the possibilities afforded by programs of the USDA. The goal of this campaign is to help us learn to become good stewards of the land. After all, we can't take it with us! The funds raised by this campaign will purchase farm and logging equipment, renovate or build barns and outbuildings. We will need to purchase equipment to tap the Maple trees and to begin to make maple syrup. Please help us to forge a plan to keep this land intact and make it truly sustainable.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><span>The major impact of this campaign will be that we will be able to pass to the next generation a wonderful piece of land that should remain together and not be developed into a subdivision or other wise broken up. The immediate impact is that we will be able to reduce our carbon footprint by transitioning away from our commute to work of over 300 miles per week each (600 miles total for Husband and Wife based on separate commutes).</span></p>

Brief Description of Campaign to SAVE TREES

When
     we first acquired the property in 2009 we thought to operate the food
     concessions in the summer and if funds permitted or in the future, we
     hoped to resurrect the campground and the infrastructure needed
     to be licensed to operate.  The plan would have the profits from the
     rental of RV sites available to take care of the trees.
Unfortunately
     Art had to retire 2 years early and we have had to go ""all in""
     just to get through this period.  This has left us without sufficient
     funds to construct a bath house facility and upgrade water, sewer and
     power. 
We
     feel responsible for the stewardship of this much needed wildlife habitat.
      We also enjoy being there ourselves so much that rather than sell it
     to some pipe yard outfit, we propose the creation of a Co-operative
     Membership RV community that will have title as soon as we have attracted
     6 members.  
There
     is lots more information on our website at www.PiapotLanding.com

Without
     the support of the surrounding communities, the trucking industry, friends
     and members, this rare historical paradise will fall further into neglect.
     This year we have been unable to haul our water trailer and so the trees
     are not getting sufficient water.  
What We
Need & What You Get

Both money and energy beyond our means are needed to save Piapot
     Landing for future generations.
Funding of early development costs such as installation of a water
     source and septic field are needed.  There is currently a 1000 gal
     holding tank and a porta potty.
We need funding to place appropriate ads in magazines appealing to
     those with RV's who go camping and may be looking for seasonal, long terms
     spots.
A deposit of $10,000 on a conditional offer to purchase the land.
      
The buy-in funds of 25 Members at $15,000 each will be held until
     the start of site development, likely spring of 2015.  These funds
     will be dedicated to delivery of services to each site.  A community
     bank account will be opened with 3 signatures.
Pre-Development costs for management and consultants over the next
     few months are estimated to be 
430,000 with some of that amount being raised from lot member commitments.
How can you Help?

You can help according to your means and interest.   Perhaps
     you already stop to enjoy a rest at Piapot Landing or you just want to do
     your part for the environment.  
Those who adopt existing trees and bushes will get public
     recognition for playing a part in supporting our efforts.   Imagine
     having your Corporate Name on a plaque on a large tree?
RV Equity Members will create a unique community experience where
     everyone has a say in how the Park is operated.
You may never get to experience this magical place but you can
     become an associate member and follow our progress.

Even
     if we don't reach our entire goal in the allotted time we will be spending
     the rest of 2014 and the winter of 2015 recruiting RV Equity members.
     Initial funds received will benefit the trees directly, first by providing
     them a stable source of WATER.
Your contribution will make the
difference in the viability of this little ecosystem that so many wild life creatures
depend on.
Risks
& Challenges
The biggest risk is to the
environment.  Without water the trees are dying.  Here it is mid-August
and leaves are falling because they are so dry.  We have hauled 5 gal
containers this year and watered the smaller transplanted trees by hand, but it
is not enough.  Without people to care about them by pruning, weeding,
transplanting and enjoying them they will not flourish. 
As community builders with property
development experience we can build it and they will come.  All that is
needed is some start-up funds.

In
     concert with this Campaign we will be sharing our plans with a large
     network of colleagues.  

We
     have recorded details and contact information for a large number of
     Trucking Companies this year whose drivers have made use of the parking
     lot.  We will be asking the President or CEO of each one for their
     support by adopting a tree.  Our parking lot has seemed like a public
     rest stop for many years and has had a lot of abuse with drivers enjoying
     it without cost. It is time to ask for their help with funds raised going
     towards parking lot improvements.
