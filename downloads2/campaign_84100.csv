<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>The Original Indy was a coffee shop that evolved into a beloved Music Venue. Instead of being part of a scene it created the scene in our area for young indie bands, comics, and artists. Our stage was the place a lot of musicians performed for the first time because we did not serve alcohol and this allowed people who were too young for bars or just wanted a different vibe to perform and see musicians they might not be able to see otherwise. Now 7 years after closing the scene is no more. Our flagship venue was forced to close after almost 30 years in business. Due to budget cuts we have lost other art outlets. The time has come to BRING THE INDY BACK To Save the Music. These are just some of the messages I have been getting after we started talking about Bringing it back.</p>
<p><strong>Cody Watts </strong>(Life coach)</p>
<p> If you've ever heard me talk about The Indy or if you were one of the many who frequented that place then you may understand what it was and what it meant to everyone.</p>
<p>Good homes for local art have come and gone but there has never been a place like this before or since. It was a quaint little coffee shop that constantly came alive with good people and good art, all led by a man with a good heart. He has an unwavering commitment to see art and music thrive, and to have lovely people gathering for good times. This man is Allen Lloyd, and he has begun work to bring The Indy back for Hammond.</p>
<p>Friends, a return of The Indy would be a GAME CHANGER for our local music scene. This project has my complete endorsement. I pledge myself to support this fellow and this place anyway I can, and I ask that you support however you can when the time comes.</p>
<p><strong>Lilli Lewis </strong>(Award winning and internationally known musician)</p>
<p>Not only was this venue one of the best scenes for indie music I've ever come across, it was the birthplace of The Shiz and a place where I met some of my best friends to this day. Hammond should have never let this one go, and I'm glad she's making a comeback. Thank you Allen Lloyd!! #BringBackTheIndy!!!!</p>
<p><strong>Troy Bennett </strong>(Promoter and Musician)</p>
<p>Hammond needs live music. I had the pleasure for many years of booking shows at Augustine's and we NEED live original music in our little college town. I think it's wonderful Allen is taking the steps to make this happen. Let's bring original music back. #bringbacktheindy</p>
<p>Who am i ?</p>
<p><strong>My name is Allen Lloyd.</strong> I am an experienced business owner and manager along with being a well know local entertainment writer for the Daily Star Newspaper with my full page bi-weekly column going on its 6<sup>th</sup> year in publication. I am also an award winning filmmaker and former director of the Jam Fest International Film Festival. I recently produced several live tracks for an album released by Dive-Bomb records for the band  “Thee Final Chapter” that is being distributed worldwide. I have also been on the planning board for large music festivals such as “The Strawberry Jam and Toast” and have booked many small shows for comedy, music and fundraisers. I have volunteered my services to organizations like The Hammond Art Center, The Reimers Musical Theater, The Louisiana Renaissance Festival, Harmony for Hero’s Music Festival, Opera Louisiana, Louisiana Center for Theatrical Arts , Hammond Horror Festival, LA Public Health Institute, Ponchatoula High Art Club among others. My Resume also includes an 8 episode Variety show formally distributed by Mance Media in Hollywood Ca. several local shows for WSTY television and a pilot for My family Tv network. </p>
<p><strong>Why is The Indy important to me?</strong></p>
<p>I believe people need an artistic outlet whether it is art, music, poetry, film, dance or just being an observer. These are the things that should be at the front of our lives and should be supported by family, friends and in our schools. But as we have seen the arts are the first thing cut from government budgets. Most places in our area are small and want cover songs only. Not that there's anything wrong with cover songs, but personally I would love to hear something that was created by the artist. Our community has a need  and the Indy is the solution.</p>
<p>By contributing to our cause , you will also be contributing to our community.  How great would it be to watch your family and friends perform or perform yourself.</p>
<p>What we Need:</p>
<p>Donations have started coming in with things such as a large sound system, services, furniture, and so on. A few investors have step forward but to open we will need your financial support also to secure a building , pay deposits and get the doors open and stage ready for acts. </p>

<h3><i>The Froth on the Daydream</i></h3>
<p>Boris Vian’s novel The Froth on the Daydream (L' ecume des jours) has given me rise to the composition of new original music material, which blends late-romantic and impressionist harmonic development with a modern jazz approach to the music production of today. The surrealistic side of Vian's writing helped me approach the music by overlooking the traditional jazz form boundaries. Teaming up with an excellent group of Greek Jazz musicians who contributed with their attitude and interstellar performance resulted in a beautiful journey of exploring new musical territories through interaction and improvisations.</p>

<h3>A bit of background</h3>
<p>My name is Stef Conner. I am a composer and musical director, and I conduct a fabulous UK choir called Timeline Choir. I am fundraising to put on an amazing Shakespeare-inspired concert with my choir, in collaboration with <a href=""http://www.juicevocalensemble.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Juice Vocal Ensemble</a> and <a href=""http://kerryandrew.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kerry Andrew</a>. We are offering some imaginative and wonderful perks in exchange for contributions, so please read on!</p>
<p>I founded Timeline Choir in 2014 to provide inspiring choral singing opportunities for people with a range of ability levels, from beginners to experienced musicians. In contrast with the many amateur choirs that rely on popular standard repertoire, Timeline Choir not only encourages beginners to take up singing, but also inspires them to perform cutting-edge new music, push boundaries and challenge preconceptions, bringing experienced and inexperienced singers together in ambitious yet inclusive projects. Members of the choir are not required to read music, but are encouraged pay close attention to how they use their voices, work hard and be open-minded.</p>

<p>Timeline Choir, 2014</p>
<h3>What is British Bard-Song?</h3>
<p>This November, Timeline Choir will collaborate with Juice to produce a vibrant Shakespeare-inspired concert of vocal music, in honour of the 400th anniversary of the playwright’s death. Our eclectic programme evokes the boisterous atmosphere of a Globe performance, in which people from all levels of Elizabethan society – from the richest to the poorest – came together to be captivated by drama. We have commission the brilliant English composer Kerry Andrew to compose a new piece for Timeline Choir and Juice to perform together, which incorporates renaissance texts, folksong and Elizabethan popular songs into her edgy, experimental style, to animate themes and imagery explored in Shakespeare's plays.</p>
<p>The commission capitalizes on Kerry’s knack for combining the cutting-edge and virtuosic with the fun-to-learn and easy-to-execute, allowing mixed ability groups to put on ambitious, high quality performances. Her work will be woven into a programme of contemporary Shakespeare settings, Elizabethan songs and arrangements of folksongs that reflect on Shakespearean themes, all injected with a shot of Juice’s experimental flair.</p>
<p>As well as contemporary settings, we will sing renaissance compositions by Robert Johnson, which were included in the earliest performances of Shakespeare’s plays, and Thomas Ravenscroft, who, unusually, drew his inspiration from the popular songs of the day and the sounds of the street, such as the cries of markets traders, children’s game songs and tunes for making merry. We’re singing the Elizabethan pieces in Original Pronunciation (Shakespeare’s accent), so you’ll hear all the fabulous rhymes, puns and peculiarities that get lost when the music is sung in Modern English. Ravenscroft also had a particular fondness for bird-related rounds, madrigals and part-songs, which, coupled with the prevalence of metaphor-laden references to birds in Shakespeare’s work, inspired the title ‘British Bard-Song!’.</p>

<p>Juice are: Kerry Andrew, Sarah Dacey and Anna Snow</p>
<h3>What are we singing?</h3>
<p>The programme includes:</p>
<p>Thomas Ravenscroft, Robert Johnson, John Dowland, Orlando Gough, Kerry Andrew, Sarah Dacey/Anna Snow, Stef Conner (that's me!), James MacMillan, Wilfrid Mellers, Sally Davies, Damien Harron and John Tavener as well as several excerpts from Shakespeare's plays, with beautiful musical accompaniment...</p>
<h3>Performance dates and times:</h3>
<p>Saturday 19th November 2016</p>
<p>7:30pm (pre-concert workshop at 5:30pm)</p>
<p>Emmanuel United Reformed Church, Trumpington Street, Cambridge CB2 1RR</p>
<p>Saturday 26th November 2016</p>
<p>7:30pm (pre-concert workshop at 5:30pm)</p>
<p>St Martin’s Church, Dorking, Surrey RH4 1DW</p>
<h3>More than just a concert...</h3>
<p>Both performances will be preceded by workshops, providing opportunities for a wide range of people to participate. I love to incorporate imaginative participation opportunities into all of Timeline Choir’s concerts, blurring the boundaries between performers and audience, and allowing people to become totally immersed in the music. Audience members who are willing will have several opportunities to get involved in the music making. (Don’t worry, no-one will be forced to sing!)</p>
<p>We will also film and record the concerts to make keepsakes for the choir members and their family and friends. Using the recordings online will be a huge help to us, boosting the profile of the choir, showing off the members' talent and hard work, and encouraging new members to get involved.</p>
<p>This project is so much more than a pair of concerts to us: it is an opportunity to make an exciting impact on our local music scenes, our first chance to commission new work from a brilliantly creative composer and to work with a world-renowned ensemble, and, most importantly, a chance to raise the bar higher than ever before in terms of Timeline Choir’s artistic ambitiousness.</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We have already raised a large portion of the budget (£4800) ourselves through social fundraising, donations, choir members’ subscriptions, CD sales and grants and we expect to raise £3000 from merchandise and ticket sales. We need a further £1000 to make the project a big success. Here’s where the money’s going (in brief):</p>
<p>Total budget: £8800</p>
<p>£1000 venue hire</p>
<p>£4300 performer fees</p>
<p>£1500 new music commission fees</p>
<p>£500 travel expenses</p>
<p>£200 programme and sheet music printing</p>
<p>£1300 advertising</p>
<p>In addition to the above, the choir members, participating musicians and I have pooled our resources to come up with a whopping £4500-worth of in-kind contributions to the project, including marketing art work, programme design, musical arrangements, costume design, social media, interval drinks, box office, leafleting, staging, fundraising... and a new composition by me. We work hard to make amazing things happen!</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Supporting us is an awesome thing to do and we appreciate every penny so SO much. We also want to make sure you receive amazing, unique perks in return, so you can keep something special to remind you of our mutual awesomeness! We’re all in this together and every little tiny bit of support is precious and crucial.</p>
<p>We’re offering unique, one-off rewards like reserved front-row seats with interval drinks, video links for those of you who can’t attend the concerts, signed CDs (new and old), signed programmes and art work, guest list passes to future concerts... and even the chance to hear your name in an Elizabethan madrigal! We’re also offering creative sponsorship packages including names, messages and logos in our programmes, and on our Youtube videos and website, in combination with the gifts above. There’s something for everyone, so please take a look at the list!</p>
<p>Most importantly of all, the music will be beautiful, imaginative and very, very atmospheric. We’re super proud of the programme already and know that you will be proud to have played a part in making it happen.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Every financial contribution, no matter how small, helps us to bring this project to life and means the world to us! Not everyone has cash to spare, but there are lots of other ways to get involved and help out, all of which also make a HUGE difference.</p>
<p>Please like and share this campaign on Facebook and Twitter (and any other social media you use), tell your friends, check out our website, join our mailing list... aaaand, if you’re Cambridge or Surrey-based, come along to a Timeline Choir rehearsal and sing with us! You’re more than welcome! :)</p>

<h3><strong>What on Earth is a “Keib”?</strong></h3>
<p>Keib is the main musical project of songwriter/producer/keyboardist Bobby Green (that would be me). I am an album-oriented artist, and strive to make my albums flow less like a collection of short stories and more like a novel. I call my style of music “dream prog,” a unique fusion of dream pop and progressive rock. Keib is also the title of my second album, which I’ve been hard at work on for almost three years. I want to build on what I started with my 2014 debut album Scrapbook to create a more complete and unified album which explores some of what I’ve gone through since then. I also want to push myself to explore new territory on this album, such as singing on the songs myself rather than hiring a vocalist. Music is my greatest passion and I use it to express myself, and making this album is absolutely everything to me.</p> <p>The current track list for the album is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Waking</li>
<li>Sisyphus</li>
<li>Metempsychosis</li>
<li>Tunnel Vision</li>
<li>Summer Dreams</li>
<li>The First of July</li>
<li>Drowning, Breathing</li>
<li>Automaton Sings</li>
<li>Grey</li>
<li>So It Goes</li>
</ol>
<h3>Okay, so what do you need me for? What’s in it for me?</h3>
<p>Having real musicians playing real instruments is especially important in rock music. Recording real musicians playing real instruments requires studio recording space and equipment. In addition, I plan to release this album with a lyric booklet containing original artwork, and I plan to release the album on physical CD’s as well as digitally. All of this costs money, which can be difficult for me to come by as a full time graduate student.</p> <p>$2,375 are needed to pay musicians to perform on the album, specifically: a drummer, a bassist, a guitarist, and a background vocalist. I will be playing all keyboard parts and doing all of the lead vocals. As a University of Miami graduate student, I have uniquely affordable access to recording space on campus and will be able to record for $500. $605 will be used to pay for the album artwork, which will be presented in a booklet consisting of 14 paintings with the lyrics to each song. $400 will go towards the printing of physical CDs and booklets for a total budget of $3,880, with the remainder of the $4,000 goal being used to pay Indiegogo’s fees.</p> <p>This budget has been significantly cut down from what I originally planned to ask for, and simply represents the bare minimum needed to produce what I would consider a true album with actual musicians. I have some audio engineering skills, enough to record and mix the album if necessary, but the album will sound much better if I work with a professional audio engineer. For this reason, I’ve set up a few stretch goals. For an extra $2,500 I can have the album professionally mixed by engineer and producer Camilo Rodriguez, and for another $5,000 he will record and co-produce the album in a private, professional studio.</p> <p>So, what do you get for donating? Well, in addition to helping ensure that the album is released at the highest possible level of quality for your enjoyment, I have a number of perks available to the right. Reward fulfillment timing will depend upon how it relates to the production schedule. Some will start immediately, others will start when the album is released, and still others will start after the album is released. All rewards will be fulfilled by the end of the year.</p> <p>I am absolutely determined to make this album no matter what, and while my goal represents the resources I need to make the album properly, if it does not reach the goal I will still find a way to make and release it. In that scenario funds will most likely be used to purchase better equipment and software so I can make the album on my own. I’d like to avoid this scenario, as it would result in many of the instruments on the album being software instruments rather than real instruments played by real musicians, which would put the project on a significantly smaller scale.</p>
<h3>What’s the point?</h3>
<p>I make music to express myself creatively and to make listeners think and feel. Over the past few years I’ve dealt with a great deal of heartbreak, frustration, loneliness, and depression, and my hope is that by processing these things through music, I’ll be able to help others going through similar things. I believe that by giving people struggling with these sorts of issues something to relate to I can help them to feel less alone.</p>
<h3>Can you be trusted to actually follow through?</h3>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, this is my second album as Keib. In 2014 I released an album called Scrapbook, which I wrote, produced, recorded, played keyboards on, and mixed, so this is not unfamiliar territory for me. In addition, I’ve been studying production as a graduate student and have greatly refined my skills as a producer since then.</p>
<h3>What can go wrong and how will you prevent it?</h3>
<p>Of course, there are many obstacles to making an album. Recording sessions can take longer than expected, resulting in higher musicians’ fees and delaying the production schedule. Important files can be damaged or lost, resulting in work having to be redone. Scheduling can be difficult as other obligations get in the way, delaying important steps of production.</p> <p>I learned about these obstacles through experience when I made Scrapbook, and that experience has led to me devising numerous solutions to these problems. I’ve been making fully arranged demos for every track on the album, and am currently finishing up the last two songs while the rest have been completed. I’ve been sharing these demos with everyone working on the album via google drive so they can immediately hear them, and will be providing all musicians with chord charts, sheet music, and isolated audio stems to ensure that they can learn their parts well before coming in to record, which helps greatly in ensuring that recording sessions go smoothly and quickly. All important files for the album will be backed up on multiple drives and in cloud storage to ensure that nothing gets lost.</p>
<h3>What if I want to help, but can’t afford to donate?</h3>
<p>Fortunately, there’s more than one way to support this campaign. Not everyone can afford to donate, but if that’s the case that doesn’t mean you can’t help. Whether you can afford to donate or not, sharing this campaign on social media or directly with anyone that you think might be interested would be a tremendous help. If you’d like to see this album become a reality then please, help get the word out!</p> <p>Thank you for checking out the campaign, I hope you’ll join me in making this album!</p>

<h3>Meet Eluktrick</h3>

<li>
<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/eluktrick"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Eluktrick</strong></a> is an American &amp; Polish indie-rock band who formed in 2008 and are based in Krakow, Poland. From the outset, the band has been an anachronistic melange of styles and histories where lack of a common language has promoted an ever more uncommon and uncompromising sound. The band has hence performed over 150 concerts at clubs and festivals in 10 countries. Now, at long last, Eluktrick are getting ready to release their second album - <strong>Hieroglyphic Apostrophes</strong>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Eluktrick</strong> have spent the better part of the last 3 years working on <strong>Hieroglyphic Apostrophes</strong> including writing, recording, producing and mixing the album in top notch studios with renowned engineers, producers and session musicians.  Needless to say, the band were a bit broke by the end of the process. So to kick off the album promotion campaign this summer <strong>Eluktrick</strong> released a self-produced ‘homemade’ video for the album’s first single <strong>“The Simple Twist”</strong> (featuring <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/SmootaMusic/?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Dave 'Smoota' Smith</strong></a> from <strong>TV on the Radio</strong> on trombone) which you can check out below:</li>

<ul><li><p>While <strong>Eluktrick</strong> are proud of the <strong>“The Simple Twist”</strong> video, we’ll be the first to admit it’s not exactly groundbreaking.

<li>At first we weren’t entirely sure what <strong>Virtual Reality</strong> <strong>Film</strong> actually was, but once Patryk brought us up to speed and convinced us to strap a <strong>Samsung Gear</strong> <strong>VR</strong> on and watch a few high quality full immersion cinematic ‘experiences’, we were sold (check the full HD <strong><a href=""https://www.oculus.com/experiences/gear-vr/1142218535850561/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cirque du Soleil</a> </strong>experiences if you have Gear VR, or check out a low quality youtube <strong>NYT 360</strong> preview<strong> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QOYpIChPzk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a></strong>).</li>

<h3>Why Eluktrick want to make a VR Music Video.</h3>

<ul>
<li>The VR <strong>“Ah ha! moment” </strong>came for <strong>Eluktrick</strong> when we realized that we could literally transport viewers into the very fabric of one of our songs and let them become enveloped by its many layers of imagery and metaphors while simultaneously watching a traditional narrative unfold and being wowed by synesthetic scenery and eye-popping eye-candy.  In the age of viral videos and short attention spans, artistic music videos are often abandoned in favor of cheap gimmicks or low-budget “indie band looking really cool playing their new 3 minute single at a bowling alley” types of videos.  </li>
<li>With <strong>VR Film</strong> we are able to let our imaginations run wild, which is why we chose the longest, most dynamic, lyrically challenging and metaphorically-rich song off of the new album. <strong> <a href=""https://eluktricklp2.bandcamp.com/track/all-most"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">All/Most </a></strong>may not be a rock or pop radio format single, but it is the perfect song for an epic <strong>Immersive 360 VR Film </strong>experience! </li>
<li>As we suggested earlier,<strong> Immersive 360 VR Film </strong>is a much different animal from its gaming and light entertainment counterparts.  It is a completely new medium in fact which is governed by completely new and in many cases, yet undiscovered rules. <strong>VR Film</strong> transports viewers literally ""into the very middle"" of the world presented. Experiencing the world ""from the inside out"", viewers are free to look around and sometimes even interact with various elements of the presented reality. Because the medium is so new there still isn’t much content out there.  As far as we can tell from searching all current platforms, no Indie Rock bands (major label artists excluded) have yet to release a fully <strong>Immersive 360 VR Film</strong>. That is, until <strong>Eluktrick</strong>!</li>

</div><p> </p></div>","Meet Eluktrick



Eluktrick is an American & Polish indie-rock band who formed in 2008 and are based in Krakow, Poland. From the outset, the band has been an anachronistic melange of styles and histories where lack of a common language has promoted an ever more uncommon and uncompromising sound. The band has hence performed over 150 concerts at clubs and festivals in 10 countries. Now, at long last, Eluktrick are getting ready to release their second album - Hieroglyphic Apostrophes.

Eluktrick have spent the better part of the last 3 years working on Hieroglyphic Apostrophes including writing, recording, producing and mixing the album in top notch studios with renowned engineers, producers and session musicians.  Needless to say, the band were a bit broke by the end of the process. So to kick off the album promotion campaign this summer Eluktrick released a self-produced ‘homemade’ video for the album’s first single “The Simple Twist” (featuring Dave 'Smoota' Smith from TV on the Radio on trombone) which you can check out below:


(click here for a larger version on YouTube)
While Eluktrick are proud of the “The Simple Twist” video, we’ll be the first to admit it’s not exactly groundbreaking. The process did, however, whet our appetite to produce a much more expansive and visually stunning second video. Right around the time we finished producing “The Simple Twist”, we ran into an old friend, Polish Cinematographer Patryk Jordanowicz. Patryk runs his own production company, Horizon Films, plus he is a founding member of the Virtual Reality Film production consortium Spacetime One. Spacetime One is the leading producer of 360 VR film experiences in Central Europe. After several meetings consulting with Patryk, we decided  to collaborate on a music video experience for the penultimate Hieroglyphic 's track: All/Most.
 

What is Virtual Reality Film?


At first we weren’t entirely sure what Virtual Reality Film actually was, but once Patryk brought us up to speed and convinced us to strap a Samsung Gear VR on and watch a few high quality full immersion cinematic ‘experiences’, we were sold (check the full HD Cirque du Soleil experiences if you have Gear VR, or check out a low quality youtube NYT 360 preview here).
You  might be more familiar with Virtual Reality as a gaming platform, we certainly were. Or perhaps you're one of the millions of users who’ve recently mouse dragged and/or spun around with your smart phone in hand watching one of the many low-quality 360 films of roller coasters on YouTube or Facebook. While these are impressive and entertaining, they have very little in common with the Full HD full immersion VR music video we are planning to make.
With every passing week VR, in all its various forms, continues to push forward as new consumer hardware and software (Oculus, PlayStation VR, Steam VR, Google Cardboard, Apple VR?) is released and the quality and possibilities expand rapidly. A year from now VR mobile goggles will be as common as selfie sticks (hopefully slightly less annoying though). The technology for producing VR films is also moving rapidly and we are excited to work with Patryk and Spacetime One utilizing the most cutting edge VR cameras and post-production VR video effects processing.

 
Why Eluktrick want to make a VR Music Video.


The VR “Ah ha! moment” came for Eluktrick when we realized that we could literally transport viewers into the very fabric of one of our songs and let them become enveloped by its many layers of imagery and metaphors while simultaneously watching a traditional narrative unfold and being wowed by synesthetic scenery and eye-popping eye-candy.  In the age of viral videos and short attention spans, artistic music videos are often abandoned in favor of cheap gimmicks or low-budget “indie band looking really cool playing their new 3 minute single at a bowling alley” types of videos.  
With VR Film we are able to let our imaginations run wild, which is why we chose the longest, most dynamic, lyrically challenging and metaphorically-rich song off of the new album.  All/Most may not be a rock or pop radio format single, but it is the perfect song for an epic Immersive 360 VR Film experience! 
As we suggested earlier, Immersive 360 VR Film is a much different animal from its gaming and light entertainment counterparts.  It is a completely new medium in fact which is governed by completely new and in many cases, yet undiscovered rules. VR Film transports viewers literally ""into the very middle"" of the world presented. Experiencing the world ""from the inside out"", viewers are free to look around and sometimes even interact with various elements of the presented reality. Because the medium is so new there still isn’t much content out there.  As far as we can tell from searching all current platforms, no Indie Rock bands (major label artists excluded) have yet to release a fully Immersive 360 VR Film.

I thought he was doing a critic. He said that he was really enjoying the music and the vibe. He encouraged me to record a few more songs and to make a CD. I did and we were greatly helped through the sales to contribute to our making Aliyah in 1999 to Israel. One of the songs including on 'Among Us'  is 'Ben Yehudah'</li>

But in 20 years, if you can believe it, despite the countless singles, remixes, DJ mixes, and compilations, I have never made an actual album.

<p>Under the motto “Enriching Folklore”, the group keeps contributing new melodies and verses that highlight the beauty of their warm land, the kindness, joy, and charm of the riverside inhabitants, their river with its beaches, their mountains, their women, their social troubles, among others. They make Tambora music a dynamic genre compromised with peace, culture and their people’s development. <br/></p>
<h3>About this project</h3>
<p>Throughout these 10 years of musical experiences, which have brought to them 15 first prizes in traditional music festivals in the Momposina Depression region, the singer-songwriter Grilbin Sáenz and his band have always dreamed with recording an album that compiles their message and sends it out of their land’s frontiers.</p>
<p>This campaign seeks to collect the funding needed to make this album a reality and to do a release show in Bogotá, Colombia. In exchange, we will guarantee all the contributors that we will do this job with the same dedication and commitment that we have always put on our music.</p>
<h3>About the costs of the project<br/>
</h3>
<p><b>Mixing and mastering</b></p>
<p>A part of the budget must go to these audio postproduction processes.</p>
<p><b>Album's graphic design</b></p>
<p>The water and currents of our Magdalena River will be the main characters in the images and drawings that will make up the album’s art.</p>
<p><b>CD manufacturing</b></p>
<p>In order to make a professional product, the CD will be manufactured in a specialized company.</p>
<p><b>Trip to Bogotá</b></p>
<p>This is one of the project’s most expensive elements because 8 people will have to travel to Bogotá. We will stay there for three days for the album’s release show and then we’ll go back to Barranco de Loba.<b><br/></b></p>

They make Tambora music a dynamic genre compromised with peace, culture and their people’s development. 
About this project
Throughout these 10 years of musical experiences, which have brought to them 15 first prizes in traditional music festivals in the Momposina Depression region, the singer-songwriter Grilbin Sáenz and his band have always dreamed with recording an album that compiles their message and sends it out of their land’s frontiers.
This campaign seeks to collect the funding needed to make this album a reality and to do a release show in Bogotá, Colombia. In exchange, we will guarantee all the contributors that we will do this job with the same dedication and commitment that we have always put on our music.
About the costs of the project

Mixing and mastering
A part of the budget must go to these audio postproduction processes.
Album's graphic design
The water and currents of our Magdalena River will be the main characters in the images and drawings that will make up the album’s art.
CD manufacturing
In order to make a professional product, the CD will be manufactured in a specialized company.
Trip to Bogotá
This is one of the project’s most expensive elements because 8 people will have to travel to Bogotá. We will stay there for three days for the album’s release show and then we’ll go back to Barranco de Loba.
Musician's paymentDuring the recording process and the release show, we will have the special collaboration of several external musicians who will contribute their perspectives to the project.",2.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Mountainwolf is ready to record and produce their follow up to <i>The Silk Road</i>. That follow up is <i>Absinthe Moon</i>. If <i>The Silk Road</i> was an explicit journey through the experimentation of recreational chemistry, <i>Absinthe Moon </i>is an introspective view on the effects on friends, family, and relationships of seeing how far the rabbit hole goes.</p>
<p><i>The Silk Road </i>was written by Tyler and ex MW drummer Henry G in 2012 and was recorded by Tyler, Tom and Chris in 2014 with Nate Lanzino as the producer. <i>Absinthe Moon </i>was written between 2013-2014 as the first collaborative experience with Tyler, Tom, and Chris and therefore more in depth, progressive, and cohesive than TSR.</p>
<p><i>Absinthe Moon</i> is 10 tracks of hard driving psychedelic Mountainwolf madness, all seamlessly streamed together with segues of trippy sounds in-between songs that express anguish, love, mind expansion, frustration, and nature.  With new gear, a new approach to recording, and the use of the beautiful Magpie-cage recording studio in Baltimore, MD, Mountainwolf will be able to deliver their most ambitious, expansive, well produced record to date. </p>
<p>Mountainwolf is asking our friends, family, and MW faithful to help make this record, from the recording process to the production process, happen. The success of our first campaign and following success upon the release of <i>The Silk Road</i> gives us a great deal of hope that with your support we can make this vision happen.</p>
<p>With perks ranging from one of a kind collectibles, your name in the liner notes of the record, custom art, being in the room during the recording process and many more, we feel this is a great collaborative opportunity between band and audience.</p>

<p>The total recording, producing, and distribution process will cost roughly $12,000, including IndieGoGo's fee. We realize this is an incredible amount of money to ask of people; however, we really believe in what this record can be.</p>
<p>The total cost for this project ($12,000) includes the record being produced by Nate Lanzino and Stephen Joseph Antonelli of Songbuilder Studios, all tracking, mixing and mastering, including tracking live in front of an audience at the world famous Magpie Studios in Baltimore, MD home of Jawbox, duplication and shipping costs as well as a short documentary to be made about the band.</p>
<p>For CD and Vinyl production, our last campaign totaled $3,500. Add in shipping costs and things start getting pricey.</p>

<p><u><strong>Project description</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>     Anthems From the Outpost</strong> is a project years in the making. The challenge in it was not in finding enough songs to make a <u>full length album</u>, it was in choosing which songs I wanted to use. For 15+ years I have been writing songs which have flowed from my time in prayer, the most recent of those years being in the prayer room at Dayton Student House of Prayer (the Outpost). When you start to sing about God's love, you realize that the song could go on and on. It transforms into many different anthems which you then trumpet out over your own life as well as others who would stop to listen. These anthems move my heart every day to search deeper for the God who loves me with an unfailing love and wants to reveal Himself. My prayer for AFTO is that the songs would go deep into your heart and reveal the truth of God's love for you.</p>
<p><u><strong>How will it happen?</strong></u></p>
<p>     This coming February 2017, Resurgent Sound<a href=""http://resurgentsound.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> </a><a href=""http://www.resurgentsound.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.resurgentsound.com</a>, a music production company, will be coming to Dayton Student House of Prayer to record my live album. They will bring professional recording equipment along with their expertise to record, mix and master a professionally produced CD. Their slogan is ""one artist, one record, one night"".  Along with their recording equipment, they bring the necessary equipment to master and copy CDs. Before they leave, 300 cd's, complete with sleeves, will be put into my hands. And because they take no copyrights to my songs or album, they will leave me with a master recording to make as many cd's as I need should there be a demand for more. Another benefit to Resurgent is that recording artist Jake Hamilton<a href=""http://jakehamiltonmusic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> </a><a href=""http://www.jakehamiltonmusic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.jakehamiltonmusic.com</a> along with his colleagues, will help me produce the record before the recording night.  </p>
<p><strong><u>What I Need </u></strong></p>
<p>     This is an amazing opportunity, but, like anything worthwhile in life, there's a cost. The total estimated cost for this project is $10,300. Were I to go to a studio to record a full length album, it would cost me anywhere from $30,000-$50,000 depending on the level of quality.  Resurgent Sound offers an excellent sound quality to their live albums along with their expert technicians who will get the most out of me and my band. The cost to bring them to Dayton, pay for their time and receive 300 completed CDs will be $8,300.  Leading up to the recording date, I will be marketing the album. I plan to produce a decal of the ""outpost"" image (castle looking building inside of the circle, it's on the front page). This should cost around $50. There will be a pre-recording night concert where I will invite those who invested in the ""$50"" option to come hear <i>A.F.T.O.</i> before it is released. I'm estimating facility rental costs around $200.There will be shipping costs. Once everything is completed, there will be an album release at Dayton Student House of Prayer where I will invite those who have invested to pick up their CD. Supporters who are unable to attend will need the CD shipped to them. I'm estimating shipping costs at $200-$300.  Jacob Crawford, <a href=""http://virtuojo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">jacob@virtuojo.com</a>,  is a talented marketing consultant and web designer who has helped me with all my artwork for the project. He will also be designing the artwork for the CD sleeve, and his fee is $100. There was no cost for my album photos thanks to Hannah Fleming, <a href=""http://facebook.com/GiliaPhotography/?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">@giliaphotography</a>, who did the photo shoot for free (thanks Hannah).   Then there's my band. I'm so blessed to be surrounded by such talented friends. There are six band members. I plan on having seven practices, one concert and the recording night. My desire would be to pay them $25 per trip. That's $25 x 9 ($225) x 6 members = $1,350        <u> Let's tally that up</u>: Resurgent Sound($8,300) + decals($50) + shipping($300) + rentals($200) + marketing($100) + band members($1,350) = <u>$10,300</u>       So that's the total estimated bill.  That's what I need to make this project happen.</p>
<p><u><strong>What you get</strong></u></p>
</div><div>
<p>     Anyone who invests a minimum of $25 will get a hardcopy of my CD <i>Anthems From the Outpost. </i> The more you invest, the more perks you receive. To see all the perks, view the list on this page. By investing in this project, you will be investing in me as a musician and in the destiny that God has ordained for me. These songs have been birthed in prayer, cultivated with love and I am confident they will be used to impact the hearts of many. It is exciting to think of the prospect of sharing God's love for people through the vehicle of music and I am so happy to get to share it with you.</p>
<p><u><strong>What if you don't receive full funding?</strong></u></p>
<p>     ""What if I invest in this project but you don't reach your full funding, where will my money go?"" I have no option but to raise the full funding. I have signed a contract with Resurgent Sound. They are coming in February and they will have to be paid.  Thankfully, I have no intentions of failing in this. To accompany my indiegogo page, I have also sent out 200+ letters to people who have shown interest in my music. There will also be a pre-recording concert that will have a cover charge to attend. It is reasonable to assume that this will generate additional funding. With these three avenues, I am confident that God will provide the full funding.  I give you my word, this album will be recorded on time and fully funded.</p>
</div><div>
<p><u><strong>Challenges of this project</strong></u></p>
<p>     For this album, I am gathering a group of musicians, who are personal friends but have never played together. Each of them are very talented musicians who have much experience playing in a live setting. While a lack of familiarity with one another adds a certain element of risk to the recording, I am confident the Lord will unite this talented group of musicians to display His goodness and glory. </p>
<p>     The best way to bring us together is to have as much practice as possible before the recording date. Raw recordings of all nine songs have already been made and we are all listening and studying the intricacies of each song so our parts will be made strong and we will make huge impacts in the message of each anthem.</p>
<p>     The Lord has made me ready for this challenge. I have been leading bands for almost 18 years, none of which have been so full of talent. I have unknowingly been preparing for this most of my adult life. With the leading of God and some hard work we will pull together to become a tight unit.</p>
<p><u><strong>My intention for AFTO</strong></u></p>
<p>     There is no intention on my part of making money from this album, my goal is to get the songs out to anyone who would want to listen. When I was 17, I made a vow to God that I would never use my music to make my name famous, but I would always use it to make His name great in the earth. That was 18 years ago and I can say with confidence that I have kept that vow and this album is and will be a continuing fulfillment of that vow.  Any funds that exceed the $10,300 mark will go toward a ""music"" account at the Dayton Student House of Prayer where I currently direct and pastor. The money for our ""music"" account will be for future albums, and trust me, it's not a question of ""if"" but ""when"" the next album comes.</p>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","Project description
     Anthems From the Outpost is a project years in the making. The challenge in it was not in finding enough songs to make a full length album, it was in choosing which songs I wanted to use. For 15+ years I have been writing songs which have flowed from my time in prayer, the most recent of those years being in the prayer room at Dayton Student House of Prayer (the Outpost). When you start to sing about God's love, you realize that the song could go on and on. It transforms into many different anthems which you then trumpet out over your own life as well as others who would stop to listen. These anthems move my heart every day to search deeper for the God who loves me with an unfailing love and wants to reveal Himself. My prayer for AFTO is that the songs would go deep into your heart and reveal the truth of God's love for you.
How will it happen?
     This coming February 2017, Resurgent Sound http://www.resurgentsound.com, a music production company, will be coming to Dayton Student House of Prayer to record my live album. They will bring professional recording equipment along with their expertise to record, mix and master a professionally produced CD. Their slogan is ""one artist, one record, one night"".  Along with their recording equipment, they bring the necessary equipment to master and copy CDs. Before they leave, 300 cd's, complete with sleeves, will be put into my hands. And because they take no copyrights to my songs or album, they will leave me with a master recording to make as many cd's as I need should there be a demand for more. Another benefit to Resurgent is that recording artist Jake Hamilton http://www.jakehamiltonmusic.com along with his colleagues, will help me produce the record before the recording night.  
What I Need 
     This is an amazing opportunity, but, like anything worthwhile in life, there's a cost. The total estimated cost for this project is $10,300. Were I to go to a studio to record a full length album, it would cost me anywhere from $30,000-$50,000 depending on the level of quality.  Resurgent Sound offers an excellent sound quality to their live albums along with their expert technicians who will get the most out of me and my band. The cost to bring them to Dayton, pay for their time and receive 300 completed CDs will be $8,300.  Leading up to the recording date, I will be marketing the album. I plan to produce a decal of the ""outpost"" image (castle looking building inside of the circle, it's on the front page). This should cost around $50. There will be a pre-recording night concert where I will invite those who invested in the ""$50"" option to come hear A.F.T.O. before it is released. I'm estimating facility rental costs around $200.There will be shipping costs. Once everything is completed, there will be an album release at Dayton Student House of Prayer where I will invite those who have invested to pick up their CD. Supporters who are unable to attend will need the CD shipped to them. I'm estimating shipping costs at $200-$300.  Jacob Crawford, jacob@virtuojo.com,  is a talented marketing consultant and web designer who has helped me with all my artwork for the project. He will also be designing the artwork for the CD sleeve, and his fee is $100. There was no cost for my album photos thanks to Hannah Fleming, @giliaphotography, who did the photo shoot for free (thanks Hannah).   Then there's my band. I'm so blessed to be surrounded by such talented friends. There are six band members. I plan on having seven practices, one concert and the recording night. My desire would be to pay them $25 per trip. That's $25 x 9 ($225) x 6 members = $1,350         Let's tally that up: Resurgent Sound($8,300) + decals($50) + shipping($300) + rentals($200) + marketing($100) + band members($1,350) = $10,300       So that's the total estimated bill.  That's what I need to make this project happen.
What you get

     Anyone who invests a minimum of $25 will get a hardcopy of my CD Anthems From the Outpost.  The more you invest, the more perks you receive. To see all the perks, view the list on this page. By investing in this project, you will be investing in me as a musician and in the destiny that God has ordained for me. These songs have been birthed in prayer, cultivated with love and I am confident they will be used to impact the hearts of many. It is exciting to think of the prospect of sharing God's love for people through the vehicle of music and I am so happy to get to share it with you.
What if you don't receive full funding?
     ""What if I invest in this project but you don't reach your full funding, where will my money go?"" I have no option but to raise the full funding. I have signed a contract with Resurgent Sound. They are coming in February and they will have to be paid.  Thankfully, I have no intentions of failing in this. To accompany my indiegogo page, I have also sent out 200+ letters to people who have shown interest in my music. There will also be a pre-recording concert that will have a cover charge to attend. It is reasonable to assume that this will generate additional funding. With these three avenues, I am confident that God will provide the full funding.  I give you my word, this album will be recorded on time and fully funded.

Challenges of this project
     For this album, I am gathering a group of musicians, who are personal friends but have never played together. Each of them are very talented musicians who have much experience playing in a live setting. While a lack of familiarity with one another adds a certain element of risk to the recording, I am confident the Lord will unite this talented group of musicians to display His goodness and glory. 
     The best way to bring us together is to have as much practice as possible before the recording date. Raw recordings of all nine songs have already been made and we are all listening and studying the intricacies of each song so our parts will be made strong and we will make huge impacts in the message of each anthem.
     The Lord has made me ready for this challenge. I have been leading bands for almost 18 years, none of which have been so full of talent. I have unknowingly been preparing for this most of my adult life. With the leading of God and some hard work we will pull together to become a tight unit.
My intention for AFTO
     There is no intention on my part of making money from this album, my goal is to get the songs out to anyone who would want to listen. When I was 17, I made a vow to God that I would never use my music to make my name famous, but I would always use it to make His name great in the earth. That was 18 years ago and I can say with confidence that I have kept that vow and this album is and will be a continuing fulfillment of that vow.  Any funds that exceed the $10,300 mark will go toward a ""music"" account at the Dayton Student House of Prayer where I currently direct and pastor. The money for our ""music"" account will be for future albums, and trust me, it's not a question of ""if"" but ""when"" the next album comes.
Other ways to help

<p>We're THE MDs, a new wave psych band founded in San Juan, Puerto Rico in the 80s. A bunch of guys who grew up listening to heavy rock and punk music and were lucky to “rock out” in Puerto Rico with our debut album “Brain Damage” which during its run played heavily on the local stations. After an extended hiatus, two of the original members rejoined to revive The MD’s. They filled the gaps with new talented musicians, and have been performing some of the band’s classics, some previously unpublished music as well as writing new songs.  We now have in our hands the best music of our career and we are stoked to share it with you. It’s been a long time coming for The MD’s and this is the right time for this to happen. With your help we hope to release this OUR new album entitled, “Vitals.”</p>

<h3>The album ::Vitals</h3>

<p>Nearly two years into it, we already have locked the collaboration of international artists on this new album.  What we need now is the collaboration from supporters like you, to finally make it a reality. We feel fortunate to be able to share this opportunity abroad with those who appreciate rock and roll and can recognize true value in original independent music made without the encumbrance of record labels.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where will the money go?</h3>
<p>Certainly not to our pockets.</p>
<p>The release of an album is an expensive endeavor and we don't expect any personal gain from this and even more so when the final product is a vinyl record. ALL of your donations will go directly to the production of this album, such as and not limited to booking: studio time, award winning sound engineers, mixing, mastering, the pressing of the vinyl record itself and distribution … not to mention additional $$$ for the goodies (t shirts, stickers, etc.). We've set the goal at $9,000 in order to offset these costs. We want to complete a product that truly reflects a collection of life experiences and ideas to see your soul through the music.</p>
<p>We want, the donors, to be part of the process (we even set perks where you can participate in the record itself). No matter the distance we will keep you informed of the entire process by adding you to an exclusive Facebook group we've created which will only be available to donors. There we plan to post stuff like rehearsal videos, obscure vintage recordings, and maybe even some exclusive goodies and interviews.</p>

We feel fortunate to be able to share this opportunity abroad with those who appreciate rock and roll and can recognize true value in original independent music made without the encumbrance of record labels.

Where will the money go?
Certainly not to our pockets.
The release of an album is an expensive endeavor and we don't expect any personal gain from this and even more so when the final product is a vinyl record. ALL of your donations will go directly to the production of this album, such as and not limited to booking: studio time, award winning sound engineers, mixing, mastering, the pressing of the vinyl record itself and distribution … not to mention additional $$$ for the goodies (t shirts, stickers, etc.). We've set the goal at $9,000 in order to offset these costs. We want to complete a product that truly reflects a collection of life experiences and ideas to see your soul through the music.
We want, the donors, to be part of the process (we even set perks where you can participate in the record itself). No matter the distance we will keep you informed of the entire process by adding you to an exclusive Facebook group we've created which will only be available to donors. There we plan to post stuff like rehearsal videos, obscure vintage recordings, and maybe even some exclusive goodies and interviews.

Just as the name of the album, your help is VITAL and with your help we will be able to make this ""lifelong"" dream a reality.

The Eden - EP is an experiment in community distribution, an opportunity for real growth, an invitation to challenge the status quo with something you can touch. This is a EP about going beyond one’s self, of fears, anxieties, worries, selfishness and stepping into the mythical Eden, a place where one see’s themselves in their fullest form, expressing who they truly are within the world. For too long, we've been seduced into believing we should be less. It's time to redefine what we're capable of. We are all artists now, and the economy we live in is one of connection, which rewards those who do work that matters. Once we face our fears, and leave our ghosts in the past, we are left with nothing, a blank page in which we can create a futre to step into. My question to you… what are you waiting for? My first new EP in over a year is combined with two extraordinary bonuses—and the chance to send a message about how recorded music still has value within itself. Seperate to a streaming service/online.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>Can you produce what you're capable of?</strong></h2><p>The Eden - EP is my most daring work yet, a direct statement about the fundamental changes in how we connect with ourselves and with music and the opportunity for individuals to face their fear and make art, to make a difference and to do work that matters.</p><p>Sink or swim--I'll need your help</p><p>If this Indiegogo campaign reaches the minimum, it will help us to introduce the EP to listeners worldwide.

First and cheaper. </p><h2><strong>Bonuses</strong></h2><p>Beyond The Eden - EP, there are many bonuses, some unique to this Indiegogo and never to be offered again. Mostly because we all like bonuses and I like making them. In this case, the two big bonuses worth seeking out are In Dawns New Light, a book of stories based on EDEN, as well as the heavy, huge, long and delightful best-of collection of my diary Hermes, now in print for the first time ever, and never to be sold in this form again. There will only be 100 copies of this collection in print. I'm pretty sure you're going to love it. Only my loyal, intelligent and good-looking Indiegogo backers can get the limited edition book ;). </p><p>THE LIMITED EDITION of my dear Hermes Journal collates more than a 3 years of my thoughts, fears, heartbreaks and dreams, collected in an old-school, easy-to-use hardcover format. This edition will never be sold outside this campaign, so this is your one and only chance to stock up. Expect an abridged, smaller edition to appear in stores one day. </p><h2>Faster and cheaper</h2><p>Sometime after your copy is delivered in January latest, the Eden - EP will show up (at a higher price) in record-stores and online.

<br/><strong>But what is the EP about?</strong>
</h2><p>It's about the connection economy and the value created when we give up doing what we're told (and avoiding what we fear) and start making art instead. The art of important work, of making a difference and of inventing the future. </p><p>It's for anyone who cares about their dream, who seek to overcome fears. I think we can learn a lot from the people who have changed their outlook and changed their lives in their quest to make art.</p><h2>
<br/>The Manifesto</h2><p>fear is simply because you are not living with life. your living in your mind. your fear is always about what’s going to happen next. that means your fear is always about that which does not exist. fear is a lie if you are suffering the non-existential, your fear is 100% imaginary .we call that insanity. fear is a lie. your lost in your imagination thats the basis of your fear. if you were rooted in reality, there would be no fear fear is a liar. </p><h2>Why Indiegogo?</h2><p>It's easier than ever to spread music, especially one that's just digital. You can stream it or give it away for free and reach millions. The challenge is that it's not physical, it's not easy to hand to someone else, and most of all, you lose the record shop. </p><p>This project on Indiegogo is my way to organize a tribe, to send a signal to risk-averse publishers and record companies (who have limited shelf space and limited imagination). We can let them know loud and clear that this is a EP that's going to get talked about. Indiegogo coordinates and it amplifies.</p><h2>
<br/>Why limited?</h2><p>You'll notice that unlike most Indiegogo's, there isn't unlimited upside here, as all the rewards listed so far have a limited quantity. I know that this may disappoint people if we run out, but the point of this project isn't to maximize the income from the tribe, it's to sell things at a fair price while organizing the tribe and persuading the investing world to step up and do a serious job of retail work in January. </p><p>Attention and connection are the goal, not maximizing profit.</p><h2>

<h3>NOT YOUR MAMA'S ROCKABILLY</h3>
<p>Los Angeles is at the center of a retro music revival, with dancehalls and Lindy Hops everywhere, any day of the week. Maureen &amp; the Mercury 5 started at one of the most popular spots, Joe's Great American Bar &amp; Grill in Burbank, with encouragement from beloved promoter and musician, Mark ""Torch"" Tortorici. But M&amp;M5 didn't want to just be a live 50's juke box, as many of the other bands were -- we wanted to find a way to celebrate femme fatales in fishnets and cool cats with ""tats"" with ORIGINAL tunes. Catty Town Records - not only a label but a social media site exclusively for 40's/50's music, fashion, cars, culture - dug our sound and signed us for release in 2017!  Our sound is being compared to Amy Winehouse, Imelda May, Elle King and Brian Setzer -- even Jack White's production of Wanda Jackson. From our first show on the historic Queen Mary to our debut at Viva Las Vegas Festival, you Rockabilly rebels have always supported us. Because of you, we are going into our 5th year at Downtown Disney and we got to open for surf legend Dick Dale, as well as Rockabilly favorites Deke Dickerson and Big Sandy. We are so thankful for our new rock &amp; roll family, our ""Jam Fam"" headed up by Chuck Wright (Quiet Riot) at Ultimate Jam Night at the Whisky A Go Go - as they have helped us cross over into mainstream Pop &amp; Rock. Our pal Scotty Lund and our own saxophone/rhythm guitar player Sylvain Carton have produced GIMME MO! which not only features our current core group: Steve Whalen on bass, Scott McLean on guitar, T. Alex Budrow on drums and Sylvain Carton on saxophone/guitar; but also the talents of Douglas Roegiers on guest vocals, Eitaro Sako on guitar, Tommy Goddard on drums and Jason Eoff on keys. All songs written by M&amp;M5, along with Adam Daniel, Jesse Blaze Snider and Ebony Afiya Mills.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>HOW MUCH ""MO""?</h3>
<p>Yeah - that's the double entendre of the title song - my nickname is ""Mo"" -- but I digress...</p>
<p>We are looking to raise $10,000 to pay for studio production costs (hourly rate and producer fees), rented rehearsal halls, promotional photo shoots, custom cover art, printed materials and some touring money to get over to Europe -- Catty Town Records is in Ireland, but is akin to Rockstar / Rhythm Bomb Records in Germany. (We can also accept frequent flyer miles - but not on the Indie Go Go site...)</p>
<p>We have chosen the ""flexible"" funding program - we will indeed get to keep ALL the money we raise, and we appreciate anything you can pledge. How 'bout this for 'street cred"":  one song off our first record was chosen among the top 25 artists on the Viva Las Vegas compilation; a second song was used in the movie ""Born To Race"" even before our album was released!  A third song was featured in the Lifetime Channel's ""Status:Unknown"" film and a brand new song off GIMME MO! was just placed in the new comedy ""Deported"" starring Eric Roberts, Steven Bauer, Missy Pyle, Megan Park, Robert Davi &amp; Andy Dick - the DAY AFTER we recorded the demo. Not a bad track record, eh? (Side note: I have over 200 songs on tv and in film, most notably country tunes I wrote as The Flutterbies for the Oscar-winning THE DESCENDANTS starring George Clooney). </p>
</div><div>
<h3>GIMME MO, MO-REEN!</h3>
<p>Pledge what you can and get some cool swag: </p>
<p>1. A pre-release download of GIMME MO!</p>
<p>2. A copy of the CD hot off the presses in Ireland!</p>
<p>3. Lyrics of your favorite M&amp;M5 Song - Handwritten, Signed &amp; ""Kissed"" by Maureen</p>
<p>4. Original Signed Poster by Graphic Artist Adam Huntley</p>
<p>5. Custom Made Pinup Photo Book of Maureen  </p>
<p>6. Guest List For Life - any show, big or small! (door charge only - travel NOT included)</p>
<p>7. Sing or Dance With the Band (Southern California Only)</p>
<p>8. PIzza &amp; Beer With the Band (Southern California Only)</p>
<p>9. Home Concert (Southern California Only) </p>
</div><div>
<h3>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</h3>
<p>It's never easy asking your friends, family and fans for funding (say THAT three times fast). Honestly, so many of our shows charge NO COVER and clubs don't pay like they used to and I often end up coming out of pocket to pay the band. MUSIC IS OUR LIVELIHOOD - this is how we pay our rent. But it's also our JOY and we need to keep making it to feed our souls. So - we made this record. Unlike our previous do-it-yourself projects, GIMME MO! has the full support of Catty Town Records, who will release it WORLDWIDE, garner mainstream radio airplay and promote it internationally in the press. What's cool, is that Catty Town is a cooperative record label, where the artists can share in the record sales of label mates. Heck, if ya wanna, you could buy shares in the label too!  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>GOT NO DOUGH, MO...</h3>
<p>Hey, I get it - some of us just don't have cash to flash....Well....we'd love for you to share our Indie Go Go Campaign with your 5000 Facebook friends...tell Aunt Molly that you met the new Ann Margret...tell your boss at that Whiskey company that they might wanna sponsor the coolest retro nouveau band on the scene!  Or - get super creative - and make your own video of one of our songs! We'll put it on our website!</p>

<h3>Hello,<br/>I am so excited to announce the production of my first full length album!</h3>
<h3>
<br/>I'm James Labrosse, a guitarist, composer and producer currently based in New York City where I work, perform, and collaborate with other artists. </h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>This is my second crowdfunding campaign for this project.</h3>
<h3>
<br/>I’ve recently assembled a number of new original songs that I will be putting together for my upcoming album. The album will contain approx. 6 to 7 songs and will be titled ""Orange Night,"" after my song with the same title.<br/><br/>Working alongside with me on this project will be the incredibly talented producer, Javier Escudero. Javier has done some great work in the past with artists such as Dave Fiuczynski, Juan Perez Rodriquez, and more. <br/><br/>In the summer of 2015, I released my debut EP, “Fruta”, which was recorded live with my group the James Labrosse Collective, with special guest, renown harmonica player Antonio Serrano – who was in the late Paco De Lucia’s band for about 10 years. This was an incredible experience, and you can view the full live-session videos on my YouTube page.<br/><br/>Now, my newest music has core influences coming from a blend of Flamenco and Jazz. Recently I’ve been experimenting using electronic music elements such as synthesis and sound design, as well as more American influences like R&amp;B. And by doing so, creating something very, very unique. <br/><br/>I love to have my audience feel something special, within themselves. I’ve found that mixing sounds of different cultures and backgrounds has always been a great platform to make music more powerful. <br/><br/>In order to complete this album, which we’ll start recording in November, I will need to raise about $6,000. – Which is where I need your help. With your pledge - whether it’s one, 20, 100 dollars, or more, it will assist me to cover studio time, hiring musicians, hiring recording engineer, and postproduction fees, such as editing, mixing and mastering the audio. This will also help cover album artwork, promotion and publishing fees. <br/><br/>Thank you for watching.

<h3>I'm an artist. A singer, a writer, a bandleader. I've been privileged to continue making music because of the incredible support of people like y'all. This album was unexpected. Like a romance that knocks you off your feet, I never saw it coming. But here it is, and it's some of the best music I've ever made, and certainly the best time I've had in front of a microphone. Singing with the best band I've ever had the joy to sing with.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>If you can support this project, I can put all this gorgeous romance and beauty in your hands. Or rather, ears. It shouldn't live in my dropbox folder. It should be out in the world. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I didn't create a bunch of goofy tiers because, frankly, you don't have time for that and neither do I. Any amount of money over $15 is going to get you this record and my gratitude. If you want to give $100, and not $500, I will love you just the same. If you want to give $15 I will love you, too. If you want to give $50, same. Love. Don't worry about the amount. Every. bit. helps. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Here's the cost breakdowns:</h3>
<h3>I need about $3,000 for the mix. The album is recorded, but it needs to be mixed and that's where you come in. </h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I need $900 for licenses, album art, including design and photography.</p>
<p>I've got to pay for the recording which was $700.</p>
<p>This will be digital only so we won't have the cost of making CD's. Unless someone wants that specifically and is willing to fund it. It cost about $1300 to print 1000 cds. About $400 to print 200. You get the picture.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The biggest challenge in a recording project is recording it- and that is already done. So this project is halfway completed before it even began, and that's a good thing! </p>
<p>If you can't pre-buy, or contribute right now, a share via FB is a huge help as well. </p>
<h3>Thanks for checking out this new project, y'all. Hope you can become part of it.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Here's the track listing: </p>

<h2><strong>A Little Story For The Little Ones</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>  Once upon a time, one very ugly orc named Ghâsh, was coming back home from a battle thinking only of a good pint of homemade ale.</p>
<p>   First thing he did was to meet his old friend Vargan that was the priest of the local temple. After hours spent talking and drinking some fine ale they both decide to go on an adventure to tell all the orc clans the stories and traditions of their own race.</p>
<p>   Taking with them the first three grunts they met, they started their deed and stopped at the first tavern where they started telling the story of our legendary ""Grunder"".</p>
<p>   Once they finished, an orc female approached Ghâsh saying ""Hey, I’m waaay better playing the accordion. So why don't we just leave this one here to drink and go on without him?""</p>
<p>   Ghâsh didn't need convincing. Her reputation precedes her. ""You are Tuyla. I know who you are. Ok Let's go!""</p>
<p>   After many years spending together, Ghâsh, Vargan and Tuyla decide to leave the other two grunts and Tuyla calls her old friend Axuruk wich she met on one of his campaigns and Rükreb the Noble one.</p>
<p><img alt=""Album cover"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i63.tinypic.com/33w1ftj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>   Many seasons passed. Many tales told. But the orcs missed something. And they didn't knew what it was. It was like a void growing inside their heads.</p>
<p>   One night, when all were at sleep, and was Rükreb's turn to stay on watch, he noticed something moving behind a big oak tree. He approached the mysterious shadow and noticed the hybrid: half orc, half goblin. They all knew that half orcs were forced on a life of exile and loneliness.<br/><br/>    Every one noticed the void starting disappearing when Ghâsh finally asked the question ""What's your name child and would you like to join our band?""<br/><br/>   ""They call me Maerkys, and I’d like that!""<br/><br/>TO BE CONTINUED...   </p>

Included are musical dedications to Sonny Rollins, Bob Cranshaw and others. I know this music will satisfy listeners both spiritually and intellectually for years to come.

The long stretches between recordings were due to the time required to self fund.

As a veteran in the music industry, I've led my own groups and have worked with some of the greatest names in the music business. I’ve managed a record label and merchandise company. I have produced eight CD/DVDs for the worldwide market. One of three highly acclaimed CD's under my own name was voted ""One Of The Top Jazz Releases Of 2012"".   ""Been Down This Road Before"" is the title of my new recording project. It reflects aspects of the human experience that everyone can relate to. “Been Down This Road Before” speaks to the state of our current affairs and likely future issues. The music runs the gamut from hard hitting to introspective. Included are musical dedications to Sonny Rollins, Bob Cranshaw and others. I know this music will satisfy listeners both spiritually and intellectually for years to come. I strive to create music that is not only enjoyable but also thought provoking. I'm constantly evolving my art and this project represents my best work yet.   I have resourced some of the most talented engineers, radio personalities, publicity agents, studios and world renowned musicians all of whom are ready to participate. With quality comes cost and with your help, I can get it done!  My last CD, ""And So We Carry On"" was released in 2012. It received critical acclaim for it's performances, compositions and production. I released ""Decade"" in 2007 and 10 years before that, my ""Landmarks"" CD in 1997. The long stretches between recordings were due to the time required to self fund. It's become increasingly more difficult for indie artists to successfully finance and produce new recordings without additional financial support from contributors like you. That's why it's so important for me to have your support and participation.  I can't wait to present ""Been Down This Road Before to my fans and to the rest of the world! Please contribute whatever you can. Look at the available perks. Those of you that simply can't donate any funds right now can still contribute immensely by spreading the word about it and sharing the campaign with your friends on social media.  All of your contributions will go directly to the costs of recording, mixing, mastering, packaging and promoting the music. I am requesting $15,000.00, but hoping to exceed that amount. It will require considerably more money than that to finish the project. I am happy and proud that you have chosen to be part of this campaign and distinctive recording release.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As most of you know I served in the U.S. Army from 2002 to 2007.  Several years out of the Army, I wrote the title track, ""Worn Down.""  I wrote this song pretty quick and it has stuck to my side to this day.  This song has brought many people to tapping their feet and nodding their heads every time I play it out.  I knew that many of my battle buddies and people who have served would relate to this song once they heard it.  So now, here I am, putting it out there professionally. </p>
<p>On top of that, I am ready for you to have my songs play through your speakers sounding just like we would live at one of todays shows.  You've heard the screaming guitars and now it's time for you to hear the opposite.  With your help, we will get all the necessary things to complete this project. </p>
<p>This album will be recorded in Justin's home studio and will be outsourced to be mastered with a different set of ears.  The duplication of the CDs, digital download cards, etc. will all be done by Disc Makers again.  They have done a great job with my previous projects so, we don't want to change the quality of your product. </p>
<p>Again, I cannot express to you enough how thankful we are to have you guys have our back.  This isn't something that can be created over night and with your help, you will make it a lot easier for us to get the tools that we need to make this possible.  Spread this link on your facebook page and any other social media programs that you use to help make this dream come true.  We love you and we will definitely keep you updated. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So, in a nutshell, the dollar amount given is what we would need for the project to be fully funded and have the end product, my album in your hands.  In addition, your help is needed if not financially, then by socially spreading the word and the link to all your friends via social media websites.</p>
<p>The most exciting thing about this campaign are the ""perks.""  You get something back no matter what you give.  The more you give, the more combinations that are added to your return ranging from a big thank you to your own private show.</p>
<p>If we don't meet our goal the funds will go directly into the meat of the project, which would be all the studio time and mastering.  That process in the making of any album is the foundation of it all.  From there, remaining funds will then be distributed to the duplication of the CD and so on. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact that this album will have is not only on me and the amount of gigs I can get from it, but It's going to have SO much more meaning to YOU.  If you invest in this, you will help make this possible.  The rest of America will be able to listen to what you helped us create.  Just imagine that, together, we will create music that others and Veterans can relate to.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Along with everything else in life, there are hurdles that we must overcome.  With this project, money and time will be our biggest obstacles to over come.  You can trust me to make sure that this project will be completed in a timely manner enabling us to put our music into your hands.  Everything we do today involves planning and that is a strength that I have going into this project.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I totally understand if you cannot help financially at this time.  Keep in  mind, with very little time, you can help tremendously by simply copying this link onto your Facebook page or any other social media websites that you have.  Again, thanks so much!</p>

<p>I am a passionate individual with a dream
of achieving success within the music and gospel ministry. I feel that as South
African Youth, in this day and age, it has sadly become ""not cool""
to be religious or believe in God. However, Music has power! Music is so influential,
and it transcends all boundaries and I feel that using this form, would break
down barriers that youth and young adults are faced with. Music has the ability
to heal and touch hearts on a profoundly spiritual level,
therefore changing one heart at a time.</p>
<p>I have been
blessed to be selected by my parish and the Arch-diocese of Durban to attend World
Youth Day in Poland in July 2016, along with other Pilgrims from across South
Africa and the world. In order to continue on this pilgrimage, I now have the
task of fundraising for the trip. </p>
<p>Many people
came up to me with the idea of recording a CD and selling this would be a good
way to raise the money needed, and at the same time, the people buying it will
be blessed by the music they hear. I, to be honest, did not feel ready to take
the step. However, the more I felt I couldn’t do this, the more God sent people
my way to tell me that I can. After much prayer and discernment, I gained confidence and
decided to seek sponsorship to assist me to record a CD with a few Gospel Covers
and possibly a few of my original songs. Once a final product is achieved, I
will sell this to raise the funds needed for the pilgrimage.
All excess will go to different charities in need, via the <i><b>Nigel Payne Opening
Doors Charity</b></i>. The Charity is in the name of a dear friend who passed on after an inspiring fight against cancer. The charity head by his wife, Lizz Payne, aims to complete the work, Nigel had in his heart. Nigel's dream was for me to one-day record an album and he always gave me courage as he believed in my ability to sing, more than I did myself.</p>

<p>I am very

The aim is to eventually get the message out to the entire world and, God willing, this will allow us to do future CD projects at a larger scale. This is the cherry on top to tie it altogether.</p>
<p>It would be
a huge honor and privilege if you would assist me in any way
possible in order to make this a realisation. Thank you
from the bottom of my heart for allowing me the opportunity to address you and
I pray that together, not only would this allow me to have a dream realised but
allow that we may change the hearts of the youth and nation as a whole

Justin Nanak and I am a Youth and Worship Leader, and Music Coordinator at the Parish of the Blessed
Sacrament in Virginia, Durban North. Apart from every failure or success I have
embraced in my life, I am a firm believer that through hardship and love, God
has blessed me with talent and an understanding of life that I need to use to
touch and change lives of those around me. Though it has never been an easy
road travelled thus far, I know in my heart that God has been here with me,
every step of the way, helping me fulfil His purpose for my life. My greatest
gift I could return to Him is to use my time and talents to help those in need. Below is some of the volunteer work I have done within my community:

Youth
and Band Leader of Parish of Christ The King, Port Shepstone,  2004 2010


Band
member (Vocalist and Pianist) at Parish of Blessed Sacrament, Durban, 2010 –
current


Alpha

Ministers and Youth Groups)


Empower
Durban Youth Ministry Conference, Organizing Committee; Conference Leader;
Speaker & Music Coordinator, Durban, July 2015


Music
Coordinator, Parish of Blessed Sacrament, Durban, 2015


World
Youth Day Pilgrim, Poland, 2016


I am a passionate individual with a dream
of achieving success within the music and gospel ministry. I feel that as South
African Youth, in this day and age, it has sadly become ""not cool""
to be religious or believe in God. However, Music has power! Music is so influential,
and it transcends all boundaries and I feel that using this form, would break
down barriers that youth and young adults are faced with. Music has the ability
to heal and touch hearts on a profoundly spiritual level,
therefore changing one heart at a time.
I have been
blessed to be selected by my parish and the Arch-diocese of Durban to attend World
Youth Day in Poland in July 2016, along with other Pilgrims from across South
Africa and the world. In order to continue on this pilgrimage, I now have the
task of fundraising for the trip. 
Many people
came up to me with the idea of recording a CD and selling this would be a good
way to raise the money needed, and at the same time, the people buying it will
be blessed by the music they hear. I, to be honest, did not feel ready to take
the step. However, the more I felt I couldn’t do this, the more God sent people
my way to tell me that I can. After much prayer and discernment, I gained confidence and
decided to seek sponsorship to assist me to record a CD with a few Gospel Covers
and possibly a few of my original songs. Once a final product is achieved, I
will sell this to raise the funds needed for the pilgrimage.
All excess will go to different charities in need, via the Nigel Payne Opening
Doors Charity. The Charity is in the name of a dear friend who passed on after an inspiring fight against cancer. The charity head by his wife, Lizz Payne, aims to complete the work, Nigel had in his heart. Nigel's dream was for me to one-day record an album and he always gave me courage as he believed in my ability to sing, more than I did myself.
My achievements thus far:

Natalie
Rungan will produce the album.


Catholic Leadership Academy is sponsoring
CD, CD Cover and Inlet Design and Artwork.


Copyright payments which have
been sponsored by Lizz Payne.

I
have received all necessary documents from SAMRO and SAMPRA to start
registration.

KZN Music House is sponsoring the actual recording and post-production.


I am very
hopeful that all is falling into place and that I could change the lives of many through each blessing given to me via this CD...So what do I need from you???I am looking for funding to help me Print (both CD Duplication and Cover Art) as well as setup a marketing campaign for the CD. The aim is to eventually get the message out to the entire world and, God willing, this will allow us to do future CD projects at a larger scale. This is the cherry on top to tie it altogether.
It would be
a huge honor and privilege if you would assist me in any way
possible in order to make this a realisation. Thank you
from the bottom of my heart for allowing me the opportunity to address you and
I pray that together, not only would this allow me to have a dream realised but
allow that we may change the hearts of the youth and nation as a whole
especially during these trying times which we find ourselves faced with.
Kind regards.

<div>Tanya Wells' musical inspirations cover diverse genres from folk/ blues/ jazz to Indian classical music and Sufiana Qalam. Naturally, these influences dictate her eclectic singing style and songwriting. Living in London she has worked with the likes of composer Nitin Sawhney, sitarist Anoushka Shankar, vocalists Natacha Atlas and Joss Stone. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Her YouTube videos and audio recordings of her singing Pakistani songs has gained immense popularity on the internet and fans around the globe! She performs Indian music as well as her original songs live in London and elsewhere around the world. 'The Seed' album with Paulo Vinícius will be her first public debut of original music. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Paulo Vinícius, originally from Brazil, has studied with the greatest virtuoso guitarists in the classical scene such as Fábio Zanon, Pablo Márquez and Franz Halász and has won several awards for his composition and classical guitar performances including the ""Revelation Award"" and ""Raphael Rabello Award"". Upon his arrival in Europe, he was selected to be part of the “Live Music Now” in Munich, founded by the legendary violinist Yehudi Menuhin where over the last four years he was regularly invited to play concerts in Bayern. A researcher of musical performance, Paulo explores innovative approaches for performers' technique and on-stage awareness referring to hindu yogic philosophy and practices.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>As well as playing and composing for this project with Tanya, he is also currently working towards recording an album of solo guitar works which include his own compositions. <br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Coming together to record their first studio album together in Brazil in February 2016, Tanya and Paulo have written and composed an album's worth of new material and plan to record them in a studio aided by other fantastic Brazilian musicians in Minas Gerais. Their songs have recently been received enthusiastically by audiences in Europe and the duo are excited about sharing these new songs with wider audiences. <br/>
</div>
<div>This is where YOU come in. :) </div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Your donations will go towards making this desire of recording this album a reality, playing from your own sound systems!<br/></p>

<p>This particular album interweaves their myriad styles and influences, blending together diverse cultures and languages (english/ portuguese/ hindi/ urdu). The impact of a successful campaign will concretise musical relationships between musicians in Brazil, the UK and the Indian subcontinent, allowing for a dynamic cultural exchange and the production of many future creative works to come. </p>

<div>The album material is ready to roll and all musicians are on stand-by however we realise that we may have some challenges if we do not meet our funding goal, which may include set backs of recording the full album in February 2016 in a state of the arts studio in Minas Gerias, Brazil. Other financial set backs may include not being able to pay musicians which would mean simplifying arrangements of the songs and not having as many instruments featured. Regardless of the challenges, we will try our best to go ahead with recording as scheduled and planned.</div>

        All sponsors will have special behind the scenes access to this process! I will be adding exclusive content on a regular basis, and you will be the FIRST to hear the completed album! I may even give you a sneak peek.. or two.. Depending on your pledge amount, you will also recieve a free digital copy of my single, and dfinished album.
     This is a bit terrifying, to be honest. It's a much different experience to share MY words with an audience, than it is to share the words of an already established artist. I won't pretent to have much experience in the world of writing, but I DO have a passion and desire to share MY music with the world. I can't promise that I will be able to deliver an album full of instant classics, but I can promise that my work will be geniune and raw; I only write from personal experience and my feelings will be prevalent in every track,
    Thank you for taking the time to support me. I promise to use all of the resources collected to make a genuine and raw collection of my work. If you are unable to contribute, you can still help! Please share my story with your friends and family.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>WHAT WE NEED TO KEEP THE MUSIC ALIVE AND GROWING</b></p>
<p>Up until now the passionate team of, Musical Mike, Pastor Matt, and the marketing/design team of Bill and Andrea, have been moving CMR forward. We have used money out of our own pockets and donated countless hours to this project. This allowed us to get the concept up and running, but now we need to have contributions in order to take our project to the next level. This includes making our passion for Christ and Christmas have a broader reach and become accessible to all who want to hear the Christmas message as it was meant to be. Your contribution will fund the following:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Studio Time</b>: more time - more music. If we exceed our goal we will put our funds towards the full development of CMR musical catalog.</li>
<li>
<b>Website</b>: this will allow us to spread the word of our music and communicate our mission to a broader audience. Our ultimate goal is to offer streaming and the downloading of our music through the site for a nominal fee. </li>
<li>
<b>Marketing</b>: we would like to spread the word of <b>CMR</b> via pay per click (PPC) and in Christianity Today, as well as other Christian publications.</li>
<li>
<b>Legal</b>: yes lawyers...we need to copyright the music, which will protect the work we have done and allow you to enjoy the music into the future.</li>
<li>
<b>Musicians &amp; Designers</b>: puts a little cash in the pockets of the people who have worked so hard, and hires more people to help us. This includes a backend web developer, a copy writer, spokesperson and professional videographer.</li>
</ul>
<div><b>THE RISK</b></div>
<div>None really. So far this has been a time investment on all our parts with some cash out lay. If we do not reach our goal we will apply the funds towards studio time first to increase our catalog. However, this project is of a time sensitive nature. Christmas only happens once a year. We would love to be able to make an impact this year. If our goal is exceeded we will use the funds to fully move towards further development of Christmas Music Reborn through Christmas 2016.</div>

<h2><strong>Short Summary</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>I released my debut single ‘Sounds You Made’ with NX Records under the name Niomí Eve and I continued writing and performing as part of a duo, Tidelines. We released three Eps, gaining support from BBC Radio 1, i-D, Dummy, Complex and Thump whilst being represented by Earth Agency. During this time I was also awarded the Lynsey De Paul Prize for Female Songwriters.</p>
<p>Last year, I came back to my solo project and on completion of my self-produced EP I received funding from Wired4Music to make a music video for the title track ‘Sugar’ which I released on Galang, a label I founded that aims to promote female musicians from BAME communities. 'Sugar' was premiered on Dazed and had 3k views in just a week and has now been streamed over 40k times on spotify! It was also screened as part of a Rising Futures panel talk at the Roundhouse, an educational event aimed at 16-25 year olds entering the music industry.</p>
<p>This campaign is to support the cost of making another video for my new single 'Like Fire'. We have the music, the team, the treatment and the location ready to go and now we just need the funds!</p>
<p>Based around the core lyrics of the chorus, for ‘Like Fire’ I will be portrayed as a sorceress who casts a spell on an ex-lover by feeding him a poisoned flower. Demonstrated through subservient and fragile body language and movement, the man falls victim to the witch’s magic..</p> <h2><strong>My Team</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Jesse May Fisher </i>(Director) is a photographer and director based in London. She will be directing the video and overseeing the creative and technical production of the project.</p>
<p>Awards; Aesthetica Art Prize Exhibition, York, 2017, Girl Town, St. Margarets House, London, 2016, 90 Degrees, London College of Communication, London, 2016, Long listed for the Aesthetica Art Prize 2017 for short film We Were Swimming, Best cinematography by FEEDBACK Female Film Festival for film We Were Swimming.</p> <p><i>Luciana Riso</i> (Cinematographer) will be working closely with Jesse to ensure our visuals can be brought to life technically through lighting and camerawork. A cinematographer based in London, she graduated from the National Film and Television School with an MA in Cinematography and has since been shooting fiction, documentary, and music videos. Her latest work THE PACEMAKERS, commissioned by the BBC, premiered at the East End Film Festival this summer.</p>
<p><i>Simona Zemaityte</i> (Producer) is an artist and producer based in London. She teaches film at Royal Holloway and has worked closely with Gillian Wearing, Marianna Simnnett, Wolfgang Tillmans, Sam Taylor wood and other video artists across different sectors from galleries to film production.</p> <p><i>Olivia Lockwood</i> (Choreographer) will be choreographing the movement of myself and dancer Meshach Henry and co-ordinating our rehearsals. Olivia is a choreographer based in London and specialises as a dance artist for music videos. She has previously worked with Jack Garratt, Meadowlark, The Patrons, Carys Selvey, Origamik and Florence and the Machine. Recently she has created work for Carmody and Machineheart and has up and coming projects with Violet,  Holly Walker, Lyves and Only Girl.</p> <p><i>Meshach Henry</i> (Dancer) currently is in his 3rd year of professional dance training at London Contemporary Dance School. He is also represented by Nevs models for his commercial and modeling work and he has performed as part of London Fashion week and also BBC Young Dancer. In the last few years Meshach has featured in music videos for Meadowlark, Carys Selvey and is currently working on a new music video with Onlygirl Music.</p> <h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2> <p>Making the video will be important to my artistic development in several ways. Having the funds to grow the team with a choreographer, dancer, stylist and producer will be crucial in ensuring we can maintain a high quality visual and build on the success of Sugar. Furthermore, by supporting this campaign you will not just be facilitating an emerging independent female artist having full creative control over their own work but giving a whole team of young creatives paid work and an opportunity to grow their portfolios.</p>
<p>This will also help me develop my project Galang, an independent label and community, which focuses on female musicians from BAME backgrounds by providing a visual asset to be released as part of the label to promote the platform and engage a larger audience.</p> <h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>We need £2,000 to supplement our existing fund to make the video. This will go towards a day's studio hire, camera and lighting equipment rental, insurance, Van hire, rehearsal space and the post-production costs.</p>
<p>If our entire goal isn’t reached, all funds will still go toward video production costs.</p>
<p>Perks include: </p>
<p>A signed lyric print</p>
<p>2 x Piano lessons</p>
<p>Exclusive live video</p> <h2><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>Shooting a video is always challenging and working with a large team can be tricky in coordinating everyone’s schedule and roles on the day. However, from my previous experience managing budgets from funders such as PRSF and Wired4Music and from managing teams for previous video shoots I am confident that with this team we will be able to create an even better piece of work to follow up Sugar’s release.</p>

<h3>What</h3>
<p>One, two, three... wives? Too much? We think so too. Young prince  from Vir-Well song has different opinion on the total number of spouses he needs, however.  Folk Group VOLYA is putting together sizzling new album FOREST TWEETS, filled with ancient Belarusian folk songs about the Mermaids, extinct Wild Bull or Tur, songs, describing unique wedding rituals and complicated marital endeavors, and (our favorite) archaic tetratonic ritual Summer Solstice song Kupaylo!</p>

<h3>20 Years of Exzakt</h3>
<p>Exzakt has always been considered a producer and DJ FOR the fans. Once finding his love for electronic music, he was a club goer himself, seeking out music to dance to and beats he could vibe to. He carried that into his production and DJ sets, creating music that would keep him moving as if he too were on the dance-floor with the rest of the crowd. With that thinking in mind, he has set out once again to connect with his audience on the production of the following:</p>
<p>  - ""EvolveD"" Studio album to be released on CD and Vinyl<br/>  - ""Electrology Complete Works 1998-2018"" compilation to be released on  USB and vinyl series</p>
</div><div>
<h3>We Give Them Want, We Give Them What They Need. And what they need is...</h3>
<p>The Exzakt brand has always focused on releasing high caliber products. From the quality of the music production and mixing to the art and graphics that accompany. Exzakt will be producing the entire EvolveD album on hardware, using various pieces of production gear. And to take this project to the next level, Exzakt will be utilizing the million dollar facility, Power Station Studios, one of Fort Lauderdale's leading facilities. This will be the first Exzakt album created in a studio of this magnitude, resulting in a product every participating fan will be proud of, whether it vinyl or CD. </p>
<p>      The Electrology - Exzakt's entire discography starts with his early works in 1998 to the present. In addition, this collection will include the complete works from his other monikers. Totaling over 150 songs, remastered to bring the quality of the recordings up to date to today's standards. This release will be on USB and in part on vinyl.</p>
<p>         These two amazing works are not going to come easy. The cost of studio time is just the beginning. Both EvolveD &amp; Electrology, are getting record pressings. This process alone costs thousands of dollars. Not to mention all of the mind-blowing artwork. It is easy to see why your help is needed to bring this projects alive the right way!</p>
</div><div>

</div></div>","20 Years of Exzakt
Exzakt has always been considered a producer and DJ FOR the fans. Once finding his love for electronic music, he was a club goer himself, seeking out music to dance to and beats he could vibe to. He carried that into his production and DJ sets, creating music that would keep him moving as if he too were on the dance-floor with the rest of the crowd. With that thinking in mind, he has set out once again to connect with his audience on the production of the following:
  - ""EvolveD"" Studio album to be released on CD and Vinyl  - ""Electrology Complete Works 1998-2018"" compilation to be released on  USB and vinyl series

We Give Them Want, We Give Them What They Need. And what they need is...
The Exzakt brand has always focused on releasing high caliber products. From the quality of the music production and mixing to the art and graphics that accompany. Exzakt will be producing the entire EvolveD album on hardware, using various pieces of production gear. And to take this project to the next level, Exzakt will be utilizing the million dollar facility, Power Station Studios, one of Fort Lauderdale's leading facilities. This will be the first Exzakt album created in a studio of this magnitude, resulting in a product every participating fan will be proud of, whether it vinyl or CD. 
      The Electrology - Exzakt's entire discography starts with his early works in 1998 to the present. In addition, this collection will include the complete works from his other monikers. Totaling over 150 songs, remastered to bring the quality of the recordings up to date to today's standards. This release will be on USB and in part on vinyl.
         These two amazing works are not going to come easy. The cost of studio time is just the beginning. Both EvolveD & Electrology, are getting record pressings. This process alone costs thousands of dollars. Not to mention all of the mind-blowing artwork. It is easy to see why your help is needed to bring this projects alive the right way!

<p>Hi, we are Urso Bardo.</p>
<p>We are Tiago Pedroso and Filipe Palha on guitars, Ricardo Canelas on bass, and Ricardo Antunes on drums. We started in early 2014 in Lisbon, Portugal.</p>
<p>Our music lives around sonic landscapes with some Portuguese traits, like melancholy, longing (akin to fado), but also with the energy explosions of rock music.</p>
<p>For the first record, we established a goal of composing ten songs. In 2016 we recorded a self-titled debut album comprised of 12 tracks that we've been touring and promoting throughout Portugal for the last 2 years.</p>
<p>We now have new material and that's what brings us here: we want to tell the story of the 'Life and Death of Dona Antónia', and we want to invite you to be an accomplice in this venture. The mission is to cover the expenses with recording and mixing the album, as well as it's production on CD and vinyl, and cover the costs with artwork and promotion. </p>
<p>There are rewards for the fearless good souls who choose to join us, and you can check them here in the campaign.</p>
<p>Thank you for your venturous spirit!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Karrnnel – yes it’s spelled correctly. I grew up and lived in Saskatchewan until moving to Toronto five years ago. My wife and I welcomed our first child, Jagger, in December 2017. I have played the fiddle since I was 4 years old and grew up playing in a family band with my sisters (Kimberly and Kanndece on fiddle) and my late father (Orest on accordion), traveling across North America as The Sawitsky Family Fiddlers.</p>
<p>Since that time, I have toured all over the world and have been very fortunate to receive multi-nominations and wins at the Western Canadian Music Awards and the Canadian Folk Music Awards. In late 2011, myself and three musical friends formed The Fretless and in 2017 we won the JUNO Award for Instrumental Album of the Year.</p>
<p>Beyond my performance and recording career, I remain active on the education/teaching side of music sharing my musical voice at music camps, workshops and schools that focus on sharing the traditions of old time music and dance. Additionally, my passion for creating music is always at the forefront of my life and this continues to be my focus on a daily basis.</p>

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>What does a copper fiddle sound like? If you don't know, I will show you on two albums: Crazy Old Man and SKMB.</p>
<p>Crazy Old Man - a solo album inspired by bands/artists such as Snarky Puppy, Natalie McMaster, Wade Ward, and Bruce Molsky. The album incorporates experimentation with the use of the copper fiddle, the copper fiddle with two octave strings, and pedal effects. And of course, Karrnnel’s vocals for the first time. All of the instrumental tracks were recorded live off the floor with the full band: Karnnell (fiddle), Nate Douglas (acoustic guitar), Joey Landreth (electric guitar), Don Benedictson (bass), Daniel Roy (drums), and a three piece horn section.</p>
<p>SKMB - a guest-singer album influenced sonically by bands/artists The Tedeschi Trucks Band, Jack White, and Gary Clark Jr. The album title reflects how much Saskatchewan and Manitoba musicians have shaped Karrnnel’s art and music. Three guest vocalists (his favourite singers from SK and MB) bring these cross-genre songs to life: Amy Matysio (award-winning actress and Karrnnel’s wife), Joey Landreth (The Landreth Brothers), and Ken Hamm (JUNO winner). The album is similar in concept to the Santana album, “Supernatural”.</p>
<p>I am doing this IndieGogo pre-sale campaign to help pay for recording, mixing, marketing, and overall promotion of this double album. Your support will help me reach the finish line with this project and ensure that as many people as possible hear this album.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any self-started project, there are risks. I have already produced and released one album along with several with The Fretless and am confident in my programming and organization to do it again - and even better this time. It is an enormous effort, but with your help, I can reach the finish line with this project and get it out to the world.</p>

<p><strong>Europe Now Chamber Orchestra?</strong></p>
<p>     We live in alarming and turbulent times: Brexit, the US election, increasing authoritarianism in Eastern Europe, the rise of populism across other parts of Europe and the advance of the far right within national and international politics. There is a genuine fear that our European continent may be falling apart, both politically and culturally - or at best be reduced to a purely economic entity.  We feel strongly that a cultural call to action is necessary and urgent.</p>
<p>Young musicians from over 13 countries will form a chamber music orchestra that will attract and keep audiences into the timeless bubble of music, in a festival that will include outdoor performances, chamber and orchestral concerts.</p>
<p>By participating with a small donation, you bring us one step closer to prove the world that there are no absolute  boundaries.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</strong></p>
<p>The 30.000 € that we set as a goal will be used for booking the flights, the accommodation costs, meals,  of the 40 musicians that are going to form this Ambassador Orchestra, and for the rent of the concert hall.</p>
<p>Tell people about your unique perks. Get them excited!</p>
<p>If we don’t reach our goal we will still make the project but we will have to make some cutbacks, meaning that the number of participating countries will be smaller.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>PERKS:</strong></p>
<p>-for 1 € we will send you a online certificate of founding member</p>
<p>- for 5 € we will send you an autographed photo of the entire orchestra after the project is finished</p>
<p>- for 10 € you will get access to backstage videos during the entire Festival</p>
<p>-for 20 € we will send you a personalized Europe Now Chamber Orchestra t-shirt</p>
<p>-for 25 € you will have free access to the live stream of the chamber music concert</p>
<p>-for 30 € you will have free access to every concert live streamed</p>
<p>-for 50 € you will receive the CD with the live recording of the concert</p>
<p>-between 500-1000 € and more you will be announce as a sponsor on every video and in the programme</p>
<p>-for 1000 € and above we will put your name or your brand on the every Europe Now Chamber Music material</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What we have to offer?</strong></p>
<p>Musicians understand the importance of listening, of sharing emotions in order to create and recreate one of the highest forms of expression known to man: music, which we believe to be the only truly universal language. Music can capture a moment in time and make it eternal. We want to offer this experience of eternal magic captured in a musical work to a wider audience.</p>
<p>The aim of the project is to build a platform for cultural communication at international level by organizing a chamber and orchestral music festival, initially in Bucharest, then in as many cities as possible throughout Europe. We will promote interculturalism through the formation of a chamber orchestra with selected musicians from the European Union Youth Orchestra (EUYO), Romania and Moldova.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There was a struggle even from the beginning of the project into making people believe that through music we can change the world into a more unite and peaceful place. We believe that there are still persons that believe in the power of music.</p>
<p>We are reaching out to you so you can help us prove that through music we can spread love, peace and the idea of working together beyond borders.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>One of the risks is that if we won’t have enough money we won’t be able to provide the travel and acommodation costs for all the musicians.</p>
<p>A great challenge is the actual forming of the orchestra. Dealing with musicians from different countries will show some difficulties on the way</p>
<p>The idea of one single language which unites all cultures and personalities will help us overcome our challenges. We believe in our baby, and we believe that it has the capacity of working its way until the surface. But only with your help it can do it.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I started my first band when I was just a teenager trying to figure out whether or not I could sing. Since then, I have engaged in numerous musical projects over the course of three decades ranging from a lousy garage rock band to recording electronic rock albums to performing with Chicago blues legend Willie Kent. At present, I am a focused and determined artist with a vision and style honed from years of persistent creativity. My new work is, by far, my best yet and you can help me make this years-long dream a reality!</p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>The money generated will be used to help complete the remainder of the album ""Letter to the Fabled Damned"" and market the record when finished. Every single person who donates will be listed in the liner notes of the album as a contributor to my work!</p>
<p><strong>I Have Fantastic Perks!</strong></p>
<p>To help get you excited about the project, I have a few incredible offerings!</p>
<ul>
<li>First things first, when you fund this project on any level, you get the three-song EP ""Preamble"" for immediate download! It was imperative to me to invest my hard-earned cash into professionally recorded music, so you know that I am committed to this vision in an authentic way.</li>
<li>Another gorgeous perk is the astounding original illustration of the Wise Witch from artist Jas Helena. This thing is BEAUTIFUL. For $150, you get a limited edition lithograph (hand-made by Jas), the EP, and the full digital album when completed. Heads up: Only 100 of the lithos will be made, so act quickly!</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511776514/kwlsbjj1etga6fp5abm0.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>I offer the same illustration in a poster form for the $50 contribution. Still just as gorgeous!</li>
<li>If I hit funding benchmarks, other perks will follow!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Cost of the Project in Greater Detail </strong></p>
<p>I work with professional musicians and artists only. My people pay their rent with their talents, so I pay them what they are worth. Here is an estimate of the cost of the full project:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>$15,000 - $20,000 to FINISH THE ALBUM</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">In my recent experience, it cost $2,000 per song to rehearse, record, produce and mix each song on the EP ""Preamble,"" for a total of $6,000 to create the EP you receive today. That is a fairly low number considering all that went into getting three songs done. Our day in the studio was epic, and I didn't have additional musicians or vocalists on the tracks for the EP. With the full album, I will. Some production elements for the remaining songs include a full gospel choir and a classical quartet. With six songs left to finish, my professional experience tells me that the cost will be at least $15,000, with that number expected to rise, because my professional experience also tells me that it always does.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">For those of you that are curious, these are the elements of making records that require payment:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Arranging the music </li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Rehearsals </li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Recording (paying the musicians, the studio, and the engineer)</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Mixing </li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Mastering (ensures that the various songs are polished and form a cohesive whole on an album to prepare for distribution on all formats)</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>$5,000 to MARKET THE ALBUM</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">A visual presence for a musician is a must. Professional photography gives an artist a sharply defined identity that ultimately serves to support the music. Compelling album art designed by a professional graphic designer adds meaning to the message and helps to entice people into an artist's world. A provocative website is an essential springboard with which to reach fans. And, of course, media outlets (both online and in print) are necessary relationships to make for any artist trying to get their work noticed. All of this amounts to marketing a record, which is another way of saying selling a record.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">These are the essential elements of marketing music that require payment:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Photography (photographs to be used for album art, promotional materials, and media outlets)</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Graphic Design (visual organization for album art, promotional materials, and website design)</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Domain name registry and website hosting</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Marketing professionals, publicists, and managers (people hired to get the work into more hands, generate press exposure, and organize promotional events)</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p>At 47 years old, I am not supposed to keep striving for my musical dreams. No, at this age, I am supposed to admit that my career is ""over"" because I didn't ""make it"" when I was younger. I say to heck with that! </p>
<p>Your support of this project will not only result in a completed work but will also serve as a reminder that we can keep dreaming and creating no matter our age or circumstance. Once ""Letter to the Fabled Damned"" is finished, it is my sincere wish that you will feel proud of this project and equally proud of breaking from the status quo of what a successful artist means in this world. I want you to feel inspired!</p>
<p>That said, should you contribute to my work, I will honor that gift. I will work tirelessly. I will scrutinize every last detail. I will not stop until I finish this album. I am already compelled to do so, but my sense of responsibility to you as a patron dramatically amplifies my commitment. Know that.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The only risks and challenges I see moving forward are circumstantial. As I have already stated, my commitment will not waver. As this is a significant group effort, however, other life challenges might befall my team and me. Somebody might move away. An illness may delay recording. The original run of the posters might not meet my standards. All things that I have experienced in the past, and all things I have overcome by being flexible, focused, and patient.</p>
<p>If something of a significant nature takes place that significantly compromises the project, I will let you know immediately. I hope that you and I enter into a dialog throughout the project, good, bad, or otherwise. If ever you should feel that your patronage of my project is not respected, I will answer you; if that answer requires a refund of your support, then I will issue a refund. I am not here to collect money for arbitrary reasons. I am here to bring a vision dear to my heart into the world, and I will do so with the utmost integrity.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>There are other ways you can help!</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the word out! SHARE this campaign with others. Indiegogo provides effective share tools.</li>
<li>If you purchase the music, please do not share the files. It is vitally important to the funding effort that the free-sharing of files not happen. It stands to reason that people will not pay for what they can get for free.</li>
<li>If you like what you hear, tell me about it! Post on my Facebook page <strong>Jodi Lee Smith Music </strong>or email me at<strong> jodileesmithsf@gmail.com</strong>. As I said, I hope this effort begins a dialog between us.  </li>

First things first, when you fund this project on any level, you get the three-song EP ""Preamble"" for immediate download! It was imperative to me to invest my hard-earned cash into professionally recorded music, so you know that I am committed to this vision in an authentic way.
Another gorgeous perk is the astounding original illustration of the Wise Witch from artist Jas Helena. This thing is BEAUTIFUL. For $150, you get a limited edition lithograph (hand-made by Jas), the EP, and the full digital album when completed. Heads up: Only 100 of the lithos will be made, so act quickly!



I offer the same illustration in a poster form for the $50 contribution. Still just as gorgeous!
If I hit funding benchmarks, other perks will follow!

The Cost of the Project in Greater Detail 
I work with professional musicians and artists only. My people pay their rent with their talents, so I pay them what they are worth. Here is an estimate of the cost of the full project:
$15,000 - $20,000 to FINISH THE ALBUM
In my recent experience, it cost $2,000 per song to rehearse, record, produce and mix each song on the EP ""Preamble,"" for a total of $6,000 to create the EP you receive today. That is a fairly low number considering all that went into getting three songs done. Our day in the studio was epic, and I didn't have additional musicians or vocalists on the tracks for the EP. With the full album, I will. Some production elements for the remaining songs include a full gospel choir and a classical quartet. With six songs left to finish, my professional experience tells me that the cost will be at least $15,000, with that number expected to rise, because my professional experience also tells me that it always does.
For those of you that are curious, these are the elements of making records that require payment:

Arranging the music 
Rehearsals 
Recording (paying the musicians, the studio, and the engineer)
Mixing 
Mastering (ensures that the various songs are polished and form a cohesive whole on an album to prepare for distribution on all formats)

$5,000 to MARKET THE ALBUM
A visual presence for a musician is a must. Professional photography gives an artist a sharply defined identity that ultimately serves to support the music. Compelling album art designed by a professional graphic designer adds meaning to the message and helps to entice people into an artist's world. A provocative website is an essential springboard with which to reach fans. And, of course, media outlets (both online and in print) are necessary relationships to make for any artist trying to get their work noticed. All of this amounts to marketing a record, which is another way of saying selling a record.
These are the essential elements of marketing music that require payment:

Photography (photographs to be used for album art, promotional materials, and media outlets)
Graphic Design (visual organization for album art, promotional materials, and website design)
Domain name registry and website hosting
Marketing professionals, publicists, and managers (people hired to get the work into more hands, generate press exposure, and organize promotional events)

The Impact

At 47 years old, I am not supposed to keep striving for my musical dreams. No, at this age, I am supposed to admit that my career is ""over"" because I didn't ""make it"" when I was younger. I say to heck with that! 
Your support of this project will not only result in a completed work but will also serve as a reminder that we can keep dreaming and creating no matter our age or circumstance. Once ""Letter to the Fabled Damned"" is finished, it is my sincere wish that you will feel proud of this project and equally proud of breaking from the status quo of what a successful artist means in this world. I want you to feel inspired!
That said, should you contribute to my work, I will honor that gift. I will work tirelessly. I will scrutinize every last detail. I will not stop until I finish this album. I am already compelled to do so, but my sense of responsibility to you as a patron dramatically amplifies my commitment. Know that.

Risks & Challenges
The only risks and challenges I see moving forward are circumstantial. As I have already stated, my commitment will not waver. As this is a significant group effort, however, other life challenges might befall my team and me. Somebody might move away. An illness may delay recording. The original run of the posters might not meet my standards. All things that I have experienced in the past, and all things I have overcome by being flexible, focused, and patient.
If something of a significant nature takes place that significantly compromises the project, I will let you know immediately. I hope that you and I enter into a dialog throughout the project, good, bad, or otherwise. If ever you should feel that your patronage of my project is not respected, I will answer you; if that answer requires a refund of your support, then I will issue a refund. I am not here to collect money for arbitrary reasons. I am here to bring a vision dear to my heart into the world, and I will do so with the utmost integrity.

Other Ways You Can Help
There are other ways you can help!

Get the word out! SHARE this campaign with others. Indiegogo provides effective share tools.
If you purchase the music, please do not share the files. It is vitally important to the funding effort that the free-sharing of files not happen. It stands to reason that people will not pay for what they can get for free.
If you like what you hear, tell me about it! Post on my Facebook page Jodi Lee Smith Music or email me at jodileesmithsf@gmail.com. As I said, I hope this effort begins a dialog between us.

<h2><strong>""Full Tilt Boogie"" is finished, and will be available on Friday, 4/27/18</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>All of the hard work of writing, recording, mixing, and mastering this album is finally in the rear view mirror. But, there is still a lot of hard work to be done!</p>
<p>Some very experienced and talented professionals have signed on to help us pitch this record internationally, to major media outlets and chart reporting radio stations. We believe in this record, and we're flattered and grateful that there are others who believe in it enough to do this with us!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>So, why do we need your help?</h3>
<p>When you see articles about your favorite artists, or hear them on a podcast, you probably don't think about the costs of getting music into the media's hands. Something as small as shipping a promotional cd overseas at today's postage rates adds up significantly. Your support is going to help get ""Full Tilt Boogie"" into the hands of programmers, editors, podcasters, and writers who can make a vital difference to the album's success. Here are some of the things your pledges will help do:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The very first vinyl pressing of any James Scott Bullard record!</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>Publicity campaign targeting 325 media outlets</strong>, ranging from Local to National to International - both new media and print</li>
<li>
<strong>Professional pitches to radio for visits and interviews</strong> at supporting radio stations, syndicated radio shows, and Podcasts</li>
<li>
<strong>Provide the manpower for professional telephone outreach to radio stations</strong>, in order to make sure they received the record, gather feedback, and request airplay</li>
<li><strong>Professional email campaigns targeting key chart reporting radio stations</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>Giveaways and promotions</strong> to help reward our loyal fans</li>
<li>Social Media Ad Campaigns to<strong> help us gain new fans</strong>
</li>
<li>Postage, bubble mailers, and printed materials</li>
<li>Professional writing for our new album bio and press releases</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Why do this now?</h3>
<p>""Full Tilt Boogie"" is a record three years in the making. It is James Scott Bullard's eighth studio album, and no detail was spared in its production. There is potential for this album to be enjoyed by A LOT of folks, and we want to do everything  possible to get this music in front of as many people as we can.</p>
<h3>Why not just sell music, why sell personal mementos and experiences?</h3>
<p>Live shows and merch sales are an artist's bread and butter! It's what fuels the everyday existence of most independent musicians. But, this campaign stretches far beyond the every day, into a truly extraordinary realm of new opportunity. The kind that needs fan support - but we know that has to be earned! We are excited to offer some one-of-a-kind items and experiences in exchange for your generous support. Please know, every item from $5 to $5000 is offered in the spirit of taking this record to the next level. <strong>In other words, don't feel bad about snapping up our mementos and sentimental objects.</strong> We WANT our hardcore supporters to have them, as a token of appreciation for those who really step up to help!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other ways you can help the cause</h3>
<p>We appreciate ALL support, in every form it is offered. If you can't contribute to this campaign, that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>

<p>Hey there! My name is Sarah Lightman. I'm an artist and a singer/songwriter originally from Hightstown, New Jersey. I came out to LA to chase my dream: to deliver an influencial outlet for people struggling to connect with each other, and to help people over come their everyday struggles. The outlet I feel is the most universal to help people is through music. I started street performing almost two years ago in Burbank, California. I was really scared to do it at first, but it turned out to help me get over my stage fright, and it lead me to being recruited to Universal City Walk.</p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Universal City walk</strong> is a destination in Los Angeles, California. It attracts thousands of locals, tourists, and executives in the industry everyday. It is also adjacent to<strong> Universal Studios</strong> where magic is made. The reason this campaign means so much to me is because I want the music video to be flawless, I want to help employ the best, and once it is made Universal City Walk will play the video on their big screen. Imagine, how many new fans and executive attention that would bring? Imagine, how many people struggling who heard my music may benefit from the music video? Most likely a decent number of people.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul><li>The funding I need will help get the highest quality film equipment, hire a good film crew, rent locations, pay my people, help put food on the table for freelancers needing work, and it will also help me feed everyone on set! I ALSO ACCEPT VENMO AND PAYPAL! USE THIS EMAIL: LIGHTMAN.SARAH@GMAIL.COM</li></ul>
<h3>I should also mention that backers get some <strong>sweet</strong> perks!</h3>
<ol>
<li>The Sarah Lightman T-shirts I am designing have yet to be released, so you will be the first to receive them.</li>
<li>Backers who receive a signed EP will have a personalized signed message, and who knows that signed CD could be worth a lot someday soon! YOU helped the value be worth that much more.</li>
<li>The free download of the music video will only be available to backers for downloading. Most people will have to follow a link, but they will NEVER own a copy.</li>
<li>Some backers will receive a thank you. Not just via social media, but also in the credits of the music video.</li>
<li>BUT. Most of all, there will be a private concert given to a specific backers. I will play a private show for them in whatever area they live in.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Honestly Though...</h3>
<p>If for some reason my funds goal is not reached, the money will still go toward the music video. However, I may need to cut down on locations and rent lower quality equipment, which may not give the video as much of a punch, and may limit the number of people I can hire.</p>
</div><div>This is my first music video as a solo artist, so I definitely want you to know that I'm scared to do this campaign, and I'm worried my campaign message won't be understood. I also want you to know I have been on set in other music videos for other artists before from indie artists to A lists, and I've even produced, directed, and written my own SAG New Media Short in the past (see Youtube page). I plan to use my past experiences to guide me through creating the best music video collaboration, but I can't do my best without your support.</div><div> </div><div>If for whatever reason you can only give even just a dollar, any amount is appreciated! If you can also help spread the word via social media, your friends, coworkers, your dog, and family that would be a huge help! There are plenty of sharing tools and links to share on my indiegogo campaign.</div><div> </div><div>Thank you for taking the time to read my story, and thank you for listening to what I have to say.

Most of the songs are comedic. All of them are honest, accessible, and a tad offbeat. I'm calling the album ""The Best Medicine"".</p><p>I live in Austin, Texas. I’ve lived here for thirty years. I moved here from North Carolina, where I went to college. But I grew up in Savannah, Georgia. The youngest of 7 kids. A product of parochial schools. While in school, I was in choir from 6<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grades. I fell in love with singing harmonies back then, but only recently did I start singing solo on a regular basis and writing songs. </p><p>I wrote my first song at age 50. By age 54, I've written over 100 songs.</p><p>I've been a student of comedy my entire life. My brother, John, influenced me a great deal in that regard, introducing me to Dr. Dimento, Weird Al Yankovic, Allan Sherman, Eric Idle (Monty Python), Mel Brooks, Ernie Kovacs, and many others who combined music and comedy. </p><p>I tried to be funny for a very long time. Then, one day, something clicked. I stopped trying to be funny. And I was. Not all the time. They can't all be winners. But enough of the time. It brings me great joy to bring joy to people. Life can be hard. If I can help lighten someone's load, I've done my job. My personal goal is to write and perform songs that will lift people's spirits and remind them that we are all connected.</p><p>I've had the opportunity to perform with The Purgatory Players several times in the past year. It's always a hoot and usually three hollers as well. The audience at the Gospel Sunday Brunch (at Backstage at El Mercado in Austin) is such a delightful, fun-loving and generous crowd. They've been very receptive to my music. That's really bolstered my confidence. And I've become friends with quite a few of the regulars, which is a priceless perk.</p><p>A few months ago, my friend Kacy Crowley and I were sharing a table at Gospel Sunday Brunch. (A celebrated singer-songwriter, Kacy is also my artist development coach.) I was tickled pink when The Purgatory Players asked me to join them onstage for a song. I played a tune I had never played at brunch before - a quirky love song that begins with a vocabulary lesson. We had a blast, as always, and I was floored by the audience's response. When I returned to the table, Kacy said, ""That was the best I've ever heard you. I have an idea for your album! You should hire that band and do a live record!""  </p><p>I loved this idea. Fortunately, the band did, too. I love these songs, and I think you will, too. We're going to make a great record, and we're going to have a wonderful time doing it.

I’m going to make a live album, and I’m doing it in the spring. Most of the songs are comedic. All of them are honest, accessible, and a tad offbeat. I'm calling the album ""The Best Medicine"".I live in Austin, Texas. I’ve lived here for thirty years. I moved here from North Carolina, where I went to college. But I grew up in Savannah, Georgia. The youngest of 7 kids. A product of parochial schools. While in school, I was in choir from 6th to 12th grades. I fell in love with singing harmonies back then, but only recently did I start singing solo on a regular basis and writing songs. I wrote my first song at age 50. By age 54, I've written over 100 songs.I've been a student of comedy my entire life. My brother, John, influenced me a great deal in that regard, introducing me to Dr. Dimento, Weird Al Yankovic, Allan Sherman, Eric Idle (Monty Python), Mel Brooks, Ernie Kovacs, and many others who combined music and comedy. I tried to be funny for a very long time. Then, one day, something clicked. I stopped trying to be funny. And I was. Not all the time. They can't all be winners. But enough of the time. It brings me great joy to bring joy to people. Life can be hard. If I can help lighten someone's load, I've done my job. My personal goal is to write and perform songs that will lift people's spirits and remind them that we are all connected.I've had the opportunity to perform with The Purgatory Players several times in the past year. It's always a hoot and usually three hollers as well. The audience at the Gospel Sunday Brunch (at Backstage at El Mercado in Austin) is such a delightful, fun-loving and generous crowd. They've been very receptive to my music. That's really bolstered my confidence. And I've become friends with quite a few of the regulars, which is a priceless perk.A few months ago, my friend Kacy Crowley and I were sharing a table at Gospel Sunday Brunch. (A celebrated singer-songwriter, Kacy is also my artist development coach.) I was tickled pink when The Purgatory Players asked me to join them onstage for a song. I played a tune I had never played at brunch before - a quirky love song that begins with a vocabulary lesson. We had a blast, as always, and I was floored by the audience's response. When I returned to the table, Kacy said, ""That was the best I've ever heard you. I have an idea for your album! You should hire that band and do a live record!""  I loved this idea. Fortunately, the band did, too. I love these songs, and I think you will, too. We're going to make a great record, and we're going to have a wonderful time doing it. I hope you'll join us on this wacky, wonderful journey.I'm grateful for all of the support and encouragement for my music that I've received over the past few years.  I appreciate your contribution to this campaign, in whatever form it may take (financial gift, shares on social media, conversations about it with your friends and co-workers, or all of the above). Love,Kate Howard-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Here's the breakdown of where your contributions will go:Pre-production: $1500Recording (including paying musicians and sound engineer): $3500Mixing and mastering: $2000Design and duplication: $1000Total cost: $8000If we exceed the $8000 goal, 15% of the funds in excess of that goal will be donated to the Dystonia Medical Research Foundation (DMRF).

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Aloha... my name is Toni Childs, I am an Emmy Winner and three time Grammy nominated recording artist, installation artist, environmental activist and yoga teacher. In a nut shell, I am an impact artist, and I have developed a new music driven 3D Mapping Concert Experience - 'It's All a Beautiful Noise'. To listen to my new music click <a href=""https://tonichilds.com/release/its-all-a-beautiful-noise/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here. </a></p>
<p>This is two hours of music and off-the-hook 3D mapping animations by Barcelona based Tigrelab, and other CGI animators from around the world.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/U-u9tFfYvC0?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>My show is designed to inspire a ground swell of support for our littlest angels - the Bees and other Pollinators who are facing collapse. (Click on the video below to watch Tigrelab's Projection Reel. This will give an idea of the quality and scope of their work.)</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/80477646?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div> </div>
<div><p>My show is unique on a few fronts, most notable is that it was designed to keep audiences engaged for up to five months - before, during and after the show by using life size Visy Recycled paper animal installations that are installed three months BEFORE the show comes to town, and six simple white paper hats of pollinators with addressable LED lights that are given to audience members at the show. And guess what? I get to control lights in the hats from the stage - fun fun fun!!</p></div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1514321957/dn7iizsfbwaqwmpetbhz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Now the really cool part for me is that each hat is connected to a different environmental organization with the URL of the organization on the underside of the hat. Each organization is asked to take the audience member on a journey AFTER the concert- a treasure hunt so to speak - to experience five online hero moments that end asking the audience member to send their hat to a yet to be specified physical location where all the hats become part of a large public installation and a beautiful tremendous voice for our pollinators! I am presently in talks with Green Peace, World Wild Life Fund, ICUN Red List and NGOs local to different countries we will be touring.</p>
<p>Bee populations collapsed by 41% in the US last year... !! To give these beautiful creatures a voice I have created a High-Tech inspirational interactive playdate with an environmental message.  The production will travel to regional areas of the US, Canada, Australia and Europe inspiring people to stop buying chemicals and the chemical laden products that are contributing to the collapse of our littlest angels, our pollinators.</p>
<p>The theme for my show is ""We are all pollinators, what we buy we grow!"" </p>
<p>We are actually corporate farmers... if we don't buy it, it won't grow!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact of your contribution is massive! Your contribution will make a real difference to bringing this issue upfront and center into the minds of people in areas where it counts the most!!</p>
<p>Bee Collapse and Pollinator Collapse is a real issue for our time.</p>
<p>Your buy-in means we can bring contemporary art with an environmental message to cities and regional areas. This will give us a real shot at changing some minds about the chemicals people use in areas where chemicals and farming practices are known to contribute to the collapse that is presently happening in the US and Canada and other parts of the world. </p>
<p><i>Maddie Moate at the BBC asks, ""Where would we be without bees? As far as important species go, they are top of the list. They are critical pollinators: they pollinate 70 of the around 100 crop species that feed 90% of the world. Honey bees are responsible for $30 billion a year in crops.""</i></p>
<p>I am deeply concerned that 41% of the honey bee population collapsed in the US last year, and 75% of insects have disappeared in Germany over the past 27 years, with new collections from midsummer showing an even bigger reduction –- 82 percent. This drop has affected Germany's bird population - 15% of the birds are dying because their food supply is disappearing. <a href=""http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809</a></p>
<p><i>""If we lose the bees we may lose all the plants that bees pollinate, all of the animals that eat those plants and so on up the food chain. Which means a world without bees could struggle to sustain the global human population of 7 billion. Our supermarkets would have half the amount of fruit and vegetables.</i></p>
<p><i>It gets worse. We are losing bees at an alarming rate. Possible reasons include the loss of flower meadows, the crab-like varroa mite that feasts on their blood, climate change, and use of pesticides."" - BBC's Maddie Moate​ 2014.</i></p>
<p>I have been recording music and touring internationally for more than 40 years. This is my business.  I am proud to collaborate with so many exceptionally talented artists on this project using spectacle and play to produce a cutting-edge show filled with technological delights to create an 'Awe' experience - proving art can change the world!</p>
<p>I am now at an age and stage of life that it is important to me that what I do creatively contributes in a positive way to us, making the common sense changes that are so important to ensuring that life on planet earth is sustained for generations to come. </p>
<p>The quality of my art installations, the animations, the music, the play and the on-point inspirational common sense message is extremely important to me. It's All a Beautiful Noise is a state of the art immersive music and storytelling experience. It is the quality of the artistry, message and the play that will make this unique show a massive success across the board. </p>
<p>I am worthy of this effort in every possible way.  Everything I have done in my life has prepared me to be here now. I am worthy of your confidence in my ability to execute my vision and to Premiere this show in 2019.</p>
<p>It is not always easy to know how we can have a positive impact in this world. If there ever was a time to come together, now is certainly the time! Your participation means together we get to make a big beautiful noise and have a real shot at changing some minds!</p>
<p>We are all pollinators, what we buy we grow. We are actually corporate farmers. If we don't buy it it won't grow. Collectively, we've got the buying power to take care of our planet. As I see it, we just need vision, personal will, and an artistic vehicle to communicate what is needed simply, powerfully and compassionately! </p>
<p>We've got this!!</p>

<h3>Inspiration</h3>
<p>When I was 21 years old I had a dream.  In the dream, I’m standing at a stone balustrade in front of a French Chateau in the Hollywood hills; which, of course, you can do in the Hollywood hills, and you can do in a dream.</p>
<p>The sun had just set and I was gazing down over the city. I noticed to my amazement the city lights come on-line systematically in large sections across the valley. I had never seen that before.</p>
<p>It was the time of year when the sun goes down you feel the bite of the air on your skin and the clean smell of damp earth. In front of me off in the distance, I could see the silhouette of the Angeles Crest Mountain Range — a black sharp outline against a massive bandwidth of brilliant orange illuminating the sky where the sun had set. I had to look straight up into the night sky to see where it turned to turquoise blue and to see the first star. </p>
<p>This was epic!</p>
<p>I was fully immersed in the waves of beautiful feeling this stunning visual moment brought, when something caught my attention. I turned to look and behind me were two very tall narrow French doors, and inside was a full-blown Hollywood party, with people smoking and drinking and being all fabulous.</p>
<p>But I didn't want to go in. I just wanted to turn around and be back in the vibe of the epic moment. But when I did turn away something caught my eye, and I noticed, behind the far right door there was a woman -  floating a foot off the ground!! She had no clothes on, and no hair on her body. Strangely, her body was like a jellyfish… Now, don’t get me wrong, her anatomy was clearly like ours. Yet, parts of her body were transparent, and had the look and texture of a Box Jellyfish. In fact, I  would have to say her body’s opacity was a combination Box Jellyfish/Gecko.</p>
<p>What I mean was that her breasts and muscle pads were transparent like a Box Jellyfish and her torso had the opacity of a Gecko. Just like we can see its eggs inside a Gecko, I could see her ovaries and I could see her heart beating inside her chest. Her neck and arms and breast were clear like a jellyfish but the torso transparent like a gecko.</p>
<p>I became fascinated by every inch of her body. I noticed she had a blue caste to her body and I thought to myself, ""Oh it’s because our veins are blue.""</p>
<p>I could see her neck vein pulsing up and down, and as I watched closely I could see various systems moving inside her body. I became so wrapped up in her anatomy I forgot there was a person attached to this body, and when I finally did look into her eyes, I got freaked out.</p>
<p>She said, “Don’t be afraid!” But her lips didn’t move.</p>
<p>And I said, ‘Did you just talk to me inside my head?”</p>
<p>“When you reach a certain moment in your human development, you’ll no longer be afraid to allow people to know what you think or feel.”</p>
<p>I thought for a moment, ""That sounds right.""</p>
<p>Looking into her eyes I asked, “Who are you?""</p>
<p>She paused, and said, ""I’m your future self"",</p>
<p>and I woke up.</p>
<p>Meeting my future self all those years ago gave me a trajectory – a star on the distant horizon to point my compass toward. I have now shared this dream with many people around the world. I believe Mik Lavage's music created a portal for my future self to come through. The impact this story, and the new music from It’s All a Beautiful Noise has on people is really something special to experience. As part of ‘The Show’ I share my dream moment in a more dynamic and captivating way, by allowing my future self to come to life! I give my future self the opportunity to sing and talk directly to the audience, reflecting back to us what she thinks is happening on planet earth, and sharing her great belief in humanity’s capacity to evolve and meet the shifting dynamic of the natural world on planet Earth.</p>
<p>The awe experience takes us on a journey, It entices us into a mini revolution, an internal revolt that opens us. It evolves our perceptions, our beliefs and the way we relate to the world around us – without asking for permission. It is an experience that turns on a light inside us when we least expect it. </p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>I have many wonderful Perks to entice you to pollinate It's All a Beautiful Noise and to signal your friends to do the same. I have been busy designing the merch for this show for the last couple of years, so I am really excited to finally share what's on offer here. I have everything from CDs to Concert Packages, Birthday Bundles, Songwriting Retreats, my Radical Alignment Retreats, Posters, Animal Chalkboards &amp; Whiteboards, T-Shirts and more.  Below are some large product photos of some of the things you can purchase as gifts for someone you love or just for yourself!</p>
<h3>Music</h3>
<p>The music for <a href=""http://tonichilds.com/release/its-all-a-beautiful-noise/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">It's All a Beautiful Noise</a> was written and produced in collaboration with Mik Lavage. Mik is a sound designer, noise maker extraordinaire, and AFI award nominee who creates music primarily for film, television and documentary. His vast and epic musical contributions inspired me to explore new possibilities vocally which led me into the territory of DubStep and Trip-Hop. I also wanted to create something unique for the CD cover, and I thought it would be cool to design a popup cover to interface with six Augmented Reality Animations that Tigrelab are creating specifically for this show. If you've yet to hear about augmented reality click on the link and see what it's all about. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH_LfXnklRw%C2%A0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH_LfXnklRw </a></p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I cannot foresee any challenges to producing all aspects of this ground-breaking, awe inspiring show, or in fulfilling the Rewards I've listed in this campaign, other than, of course, failing to make my 350k goal. If this was the case, all your rewards would be created and fulfilled regardless and the money left over will go toward production elements and we will continue to push on to bring the show to market. </p>
<p>I launched a Kickstarter campaign in 2013 and raised $111K, just over my target amount. In 2013, 699 individuals pledged to my Kickstarter to put it over the line. This was my very first crowd-funding campaign, and I learned a lot from that experience.</p>
<p>There were many issues on the first campaign I had to overcome, such as organizing the mailing list and finding the right fulfillment warehouses in China and the US. In China, I had massive delays because I had to prove that the music I was shipping from the China warehouse was in fact my Intellectual property. We recently linked our shop to our two fulfillment centre warehouses New Jersey and Shenzhen. This will ensure our shipments are sent out timely and efficiently as we grow our touring company business. I am bringing all I learned to this campaign.</p>
<p>All of the collaborators on this project are top professionals in their respective fields, with excellent production credentials. The only thing that would actually prevent follow through with the show would be if there was a personal tragedy, but that would not effect delivering on your rewards. and that is not likely...</p>
<p>I am happy announce Rae Mitchell as my new manager with 16 years of sales experience at JB Hi-Fi in Australia of which 10 years were spent as Store Manager. Rae will oversee manufacturing and ensure that all products are produced and delivered effectively and efficiently. The manufacturers producing my rewards have a proven reputation for delivering quality work. With the combined expertise of these professionals, plus my success as a producer and performer over many years in the music industry, I am fully confident I will reach my goal and deliver all my Perks.</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","Short Summary
Aloha... my name is Toni Childs, I am an Emmy Winner and three time Grammy nominated recording artist, installation artist, environmental activist and yoga teacher. In a nut shell, I am an impact artist, and I have developed a new music driven 3D Mapping Concert Experience - 'It's All a Beautiful Noise'. To listen to my new music click here. 
This is two hours of music and off-the-hook 3D mapping animations by Barcelona based Tigrelab, and other CGI animators from around the world.

My show is designed to inspire a ground swell of support for our littlest angels - the Bees and other Pollinators who are facing collapse. (Click on the video below to watch Tigrelab's Projection Reel. This will give an idea of the quality and scope of their work.)

 
My show is unique on a few fronts, most notable is that it was designed to keep audiences engaged for up to five months - before, during and after the show by using life size Visy Recycled paper animal installations that are installed three months BEFORE the show comes to town, and six simple white paper hats of pollinators with addressable LED lights that are given to audience members at the show. And guess what? I get to control lights in the hats from the stage - fun fun fun!!

Now the really cool part for me is that each hat is connected to a different environmental organization with the URL of the organization on the underside of the hat. Each organization is asked to take the audience member on a journey AFTER the concert- a treasure hunt so to speak - to experience five online hero moments that end asking the audience member to send their hat to a yet to be specified physical location where all the hats become part of a large public installation and a beautiful tremendous voice for our pollinators! I am presently in talks with Green Peace, World Wild Life Fund, ICUN Red List and NGOs local to different countries we will be touring.
Bee populations collapsed by 41% in the US last year... !! To give these beautiful creatures a voice I have created a High-Tech inspirational interactive playdate with an environmental message.  The production will travel to regional areas of the US, Canada, Australia and Europe inspiring people to stop buying chemicals and the chemical laden products that are contributing to the collapse of our littlest angels, our pollinators.
The theme for my show is ""We are all pollinators, what we buy we grow!"" 
We are actually corporate farmers... if we don't buy it, it won't grow!
“as Interaction with social media and its tools become more and more sophisticated so to has the expectation of audiences for more than just a music experience. People are seeking to belong, to engage, and participate in change.” - MIT Press





What We Need...
$350,000 to fund the production elements that make up the show plus eight weeks of rehearsals, and the promotional materials that will sell the show.

The design, fabrication and build of three popup sets for touring the show in the US, Europe and Australia. (I am fabricating three sets in three different countries to reduce international shipping costs to our touring company.);
Creation of Two hours of 3D animation filming live action footage;
 Design and fabrication of an exoskeletal suit that brings an Avatar like experience to the show ;
Four weeks with a Dramaturge to really nut-out the flow of the show and tighten the storytelling elements; 
Four weeks of production rehearsals with the musicians in Barcelona bringing all the elements together: the music, the set, 3D animations, lights, sound and storytelling.
A camera crew to document the making of the show and provide us with the key elements that will be used for promotional materials that will sell the show to Performing Arts Centre Networks and Arts Festivals around the world.

By participating in this campaign you will be rewarded with an Indiegogo Perk of your choice, but more importantly you will be rewarded with knowing that you actually did something that has a real shot at turning the tide for our littlest angels on the planet by giving a voice to the Bees!

The Impact
The impact of your contribution is massive! Your contribution will make a real difference to bringing this issue upfront and center into the minds of people in areas where it counts the most!!
Bee Collapse and Pollinator Collapse is a real issue for our time.
Your buy-in means we can bring contemporary art with an environmental message to cities and regional areas. This will give us a real shot at changing some minds about the chemicals people use in areas where chemicals and farming practices are known to contribute to the collapse that is presently happening in the US and Canada and other parts of the world. 
Maddie Moate at the BBC asks, ""Where would we be without bees? As far as important species go, they are top of the list. They are critical pollinators: they pollinate 70 of the around 100 crop species that feed 90% of the world. Honey bees are responsible for $30 billion a year in crops.""
I am deeply concerned that 41% of the honey bee population collapsed in the US last year, and 75% of insects have disappeared in Germany over the past 27 years, with new collections from midsummer showing an even bigger reduction –- 82 percent. This drop has affected Germany's bird population - 15% of the birds are dying because their food supply is disappearing. http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0185809
""If we lose the bees we may lose all the plants that bees pollinate, all of the animals that eat those plants and so on up the food chain. Which means a world without bees could struggle to sustain the global human population of 7 billion. Our supermarkets would have half the amount of fruit and vegetables.
It gets worse. We are losing bees at an alarming rate. Possible reasons include the loss of flower meadows, the crab-like varroa mite that feasts on their blood, climate change, and use of pesticides."" - BBC's Maddie Moate​ 2014.
I have been recording music and touring internationally for more than 40 years. This is my business.  I am proud to collaborate with so many exceptionally talented artists on this project using spectacle and play to produce a cutting-edge show filled with technological delights to create an 'Awe' experience - proving art can change the world!
I am now at an age and stage of life that it is important to me that what I do creatively contributes in a positive way to us, making the common sense changes that are so important to ensuring that life on planet earth is sustained for generations to come. 
The quality of my art installations, the animations, the music, the play and the on-point inspirational common sense message is extremely important to me. It's All a Beautiful Noise is a state of the art immersive music and storytelling experience. It is the quality of the artistry, message and the play that will make this unique show a massive success across the board. 
I am worthy of this effort in every possible way.  Everything I have done in my life has prepared me to be here now. I am worthy of your confidence in my ability to execute my vision and to Premiere this show in 2019.
It is not always easy to know how we can have a positive impact in this world. If there ever was a time to come together, now is certainly the time! Your participation means together we get to make a big beautiful noise and have a real shot at changing some minds!
We are all pollinators, what we buy we grow. We are actually corporate farmers. If we don't buy it it won't grow. Collectively, we've got the buying power to take care of our planet. As I see it, we just need vision, personal will, and an artistic vehicle to communicate what is needed simply, powerfully and compassionately! 
We've got this!!

 
Inspiration
When I was 21 years old I had a dream.  In the dream, I’m standing at a stone balustrade in front of a French Chateau in the Hollywood hills; which, of course, you can do in the Hollywood hills, and you can do in a dream.
The sun had just set and I was gazing down over the city. I noticed to my amazement the city lights come on-line systematically in large sections across the valley. I had never seen that before.
It was the time of year when the sun goes down you feel the bite of the air on your skin and the clean smell of damp earth. In front of me off in the distance, I could see the silhouette of the Angeles Crest Mountain Range — a black sharp outline against a massive bandwidth of brilliant orange illuminating the sky where the sun had set. I had to look straight up into the night sky to see where it turned to turquoise blue and to see the first star. 
This was epic!
I was fully immersed in the waves of beautiful feeling this stunning visual moment brought, when something caught my attention. I turned to look and behind me were two very tall narrow French doors, and inside was a full-blown Hollywood party, with people smoking and drinking and being all fabulous.
But I didn't want to go in. I just wanted to turn around and be back in the vibe of the epic moment. But when I did turn away something caught my eye, and I noticed, behind the far right door there was a woman -  floating a foot off the ground!! She had no clothes on, and no hair on her body. Strangely, her body was like a jellyfish… Now, don’t get me wrong, her anatomy was clearly like ours. Yet, parts of her body were transparent, and had the look and texture of a Box Jellyfish. In fact, I  would have to say her body’s opacity was a combination Box Jellyfish/Gecko.
What I mean was that her breasts and muscle pads were transparent like a Box Jellyfish and her torso had the opacity of a Gecko. Just like we can see its eggs inside a Gecko, I could see her ovaries and I could see her heart beating inside her chest. Her neck and arms and breast were clear like a jellyfish but the torso transparent like a gecko.
I became fascinated by every inch of her body. I noticed she had a blue caste to her body and I thought to myself, ""Oh it’s because our veins are blue.""
I could see her neck vein pulsing up and down, and as I watched closely I could see various systems moving inside her body. I became so wrapped up in her anatomy I forgot there was a person attached to this body, and when I finally did look into her eyes, I got freaked out.
She said, “Don’t be afraid!” But her lips didn’t move.
And I said, ‘Did you just talk to me inside my head?”
“When you reach a certain moment in your human development, you’ll no longer be afraid to allow people to know what you think or feel.”
I thought for a moment, ""That sounds right.""
Looking into her eyes I asked, “Who are you?""
She paused, and said, ""I’m your future self"",
and I woke up.
Meeting my future self all those years ago gave me a trajectory – a star on the distant horizon to point my compass toward. I have now shared this dream with many people around the world. I believe Mik Lavage's music created a portal for my future self to come through. The impact this story, and the new music from It’s All a Beautiful Noise has on people is really something special to experience. As part of ‘The Show’ I share my dream moment in a more dynamic and captivating way, by allowing my future self to come to life! I give my future self the opportunity to sing and talk directly to the audience, reflecting back to us what she thinks is happening on planet earth, and sharing her great belief in humanity’s capacity to evolve and meet the shifting dynamic of the natural world on planet Earth.
The awe experience takes us on a journey, It entices us into a mini revolution, an internal revolt that opens us. It evolves our perceptions, our beliefs and the way we relate to the world around us – without asking for permission. It is an experience that turns on a light inside us when we least expect it. 
What You Get
I have many wonderful Perks to entice you to pollinate It's All a Beautiful Noise and to signal your friends to do the same. I have been busy designing the merch for this show for the last couple of years, so I am really excited to finally share what's on offer here. I have everything from CDs to Concert Packages, Birthday Bundles, Songwriting Retreats, my Radical Alignment Retreats, Posters, Animal Chalkboards & Whiteboards, T-Shirts and more.  Below are some large product photos of some of the things you can purchase as gifts for someone you love or just for yourself!
Music
The music for It's All a Beautiful Noise was written and produced in collaboration with Mik Lavage. Mik is a sound designer, noise maker extraordinaire, and AFI award nominee who creates music primarily for film, television and documentary. His vast and epic musical contributions inspired me to explore new possibilities vocally which led me into the territory of DubStep and Trip-Hop. I also wanted to create something unique for the CD cover, and I thought it would be cool to design a popup cover to interface with six Augmented Reality Animations that Tigrelab are creating specifically for this show. If you've yet to hear about augmented reality click on the link and see what it's all about. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oH_LfXnklRw

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I remember ten years ago when I wrote my first song. I was sitting in my bedroom thinking about how I wasn't very good at talking to anyone and I just wished I could say the things I wanted to say. I had all these feelings that I wanted to understand, and make other people understand. Little did I know that all of that frustration, anxiety, depression &amp; confusion would lead me on the greatest adventure of my life. Now here I am ten years later, sipping a coffee, knowing I'm about to release not just my third, but also my fourth full length album. </p>
<p>Throughout the last ten years I've been blessed with the opportunity to tour the world, play my songs in front of thousands of people, and go to sleep knowing that millions of humans have listened to my songs. The messages I get everyday inspire me to keep growing as a person and an artist, because I want to continue doing my part in spreading my love for creation and hopefully inspire others to do the same.</p>
<p>That being said, I've spent the last few years writing two brand new full length albums. One is a SayWeCanFly album called ""Beautiful Mess"", and the other is an electronic album which I am releasing under my name, Braden Barrie, called ""Limitless"". I was fortunate enough to partner with Epitaph Records on my last two releases, but I've decided to undertake these new releases completely independently. My vision for this album cycle is that WE ARE the record label. It's been an incredible ten years of growth, failure, success, and hard work. And now I believe it's time we truly bring this to the next level.. and that we have the power to do so. The music industry is constantly changing, but the one thing that will always remain the same is the fact that you are the driving force. You decide which artists make it, or don't. And I know that together, if you decide to support the journey I'm embarking on, we have the power to make a monumental impact.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise $100,000 for this record cycle. This is a standard ""big label"" budget for just one album, but this will easily support the creation, release, and promotion of two. I also decided that I want to donate 5% of album sales to an organization called ""To Write Love On Her Arms"" in support of suicide prevention and awareness, because that's something I know hits home for many people who listen to my music, and all over the world. At the bottom of this page you can see an exact breakdown of the budget.</p>
<p>And here are the AWESOME perks you'll get with your donations. I'm really excited about all of these and no matter how much you give, your name will be included in a digital thank you booklet.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If you choose to support my campaign, you are literally helping me create these songs, videos, and the opportunity for them to be heard louder than anything I've ever released. Whether you have followed me for years or this is the first time you found out I existed, these albums belong to you just as much as they belong to me. If we can get these out into the world the way that I plan to, it will only grow our potential to leave a positive mark on the universe. That's what I want, and that's what is most important to me. Whether I know you or not, the fact that we are on this earth at the same time DID have an impact on my life in some small way. Which means it had an impact on these songs. It's not just about the music, it's about the energy. The more these songs are heard, the bigger opportunity we have to step up and work toward effecting peoples lives in a positive way through our connection, bigger shows, and more room to create opportunities like workshops, special events, etc. Along with all of that, you'll be supporting an incredible organization called ""To Write Love On Her Arms"" which solely exists to help people get through depression, loss, and the fight against suicide. They have helped many people that I know personally and supported me greatly back on the Vans Warped Tour when I did my first year. In my eyes, all of this goes far beyond the music itself. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Budget</h3>
<p>Here is a breakdown of where all of the money will go. This is based on a 10 month album cycle.</p>
<p>Production, Mixing &amp; Mastering - $5000</p>
<p>Music Videos - $40,000 (8+ videos)</p>
<p>Print Magazine Promotional Ads - $20,000 ($2000 / month)</p>
<p>Online Promotional Ads - $20,000 ($2000 / month)</p>
<p>Perk Fullfillment - $8000</p>
<p>Indiegogo fees (4%) - $4000</p>
<p>Credit Card fees (3%) - $3000</p>
<p>TOTAL - $100,000</p>
<p>* 5% of album sales will be donated to ""To Write Love On Her Arms"" in support of suicide prevention and awareness.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know some of you may not be able to help out financially with this campaign, but that doesn't matter. If this is something that you're passionate about and want to get behind, you can still have a massive impact on the success of this project by sharing it. At the top of the page there are a bunch of social sharing buttons that you can use to help spread the word. Or if you want to be super personal, you could even write the URL down on paper and mail it to someone you care about. Or put it in a bottle and throw it into the ocean. Anything helps.</p>

Whether you have followed me for years or this is the first time you found out I existed, these albums belong to you just as much as they belong to me. If we can get these out into the world the way that I plan to, it will only grow our potential to leave a positive mark on the universe. That's what I want, and that's what is most important to me. Whether I know you or not, the fact that we are on this earth at the same time DID have an impact on my life in some small way. Which means it had an impact on these songs. It's not just about the music, it's about the energy. The more these songs are heard, the bigger opportunity we have to step up and work toward effecting peoples lives in a positive way through our connection, bigger shows, and more room to create opportunities like workshops, special events, etc. Along with all of that, you'll be supporting an incredible organization called ""To Write Love On Her Arms"" which solely exists to help people get through depression, loss, and the fight against suicide. They have helped many people that I know personally and supported me greatly back on the Vans Warped Tour when I did my first year. In my eyes, all of this goes far beyond the music itself. 
 

Budget
Here is a breakdown of where all of the money will go. This is based on a 10 month album cycle.
Production, Mixing & Mastering - $5000
Music Videos - $40,000 (8+ videos)
Print Magazine Promotional Ads - $20,000 ($2000 / month)
Online Promotional Ads - $20,000 ($2000 / month)
Perk Fullfillment - $8000
Indiegogo fees (4%) - $4000
Credit Card fees (3%) - $3000
TOTAL - $100,000
* 5% of album sales will be donated to ""To Write Love On Her Arms"" in support of suicide prevention and awareness.

<h3>Hard-hitting first-offering EP from Lantern Road</h3>
<p>Lantern Road is nearing completion of their EP. More than five years since the band originated, they've invested hundreds of hours perfecting their sound, and the result is the debut EP, ""Wisdom of the Ancients"".</p>
<h3>Who is Lantern Road?</h3>
<p>We are a collection of serious musicians assembled by veteran player, Carlos Haden. We feature original music with a new, classic rock sound.</p>
<p>We are seeking support to help us fund the logistics and distribution of our music to a mass audience world-wide.</p>
<p>Lantern Road has become extremely tight-knit.  We hope to welcome new fans and contributors to become a part of our family.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We aim to bribe you into helping us!</p>
<p>Contributions will allow us to fund CD and video production, marketing and merchandising efforts, equipment needs, traveling/touring expenses, and pet food for the band member's various critters. </p>
<p>In addition to helping launch the Lantern Road band, contributors will receive cool band merchandise, special recognition from the band, and our undying love and appreciation!</p>
<p>We will strive to fund these goals regardless of if we reach the goal of this campaign, or not. All members have already contributed greatly, in many ways. Due to the youth of the members (2 out of the 4, anyway), it will take far longer to accomplish this without your help.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The goal of all band members is to create music that will move and inspire music-lovers around the world. This campaign will help us reach as many as possible, and to share the music that we have poured our hearts and souls into.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Kalysta Sylvester. I have been singing since I was a young girl, and have been playing piano for over 15 years. With Detroit Motown roots within my family, music has always been a significant part of my life and a true passion. I have always felt a deeper meaning behind my performances and I love the exchange of energy between the audience and the performer. Music has been there for myself and many others, getting us through tough times. If I could help just one person through my own music, I will have accomplished my dream. </p>
<p>I was discovered in 2019, by Michael Barbee, Greta Van Fleet’s (Grammy award winning band) former manager. Proving that this dream really does need to be a reality and I am on my way. I would love to bring back that good soul, rhythm and blues music with strong female vocals. The world needs some soul right now!</p>
<p>In order for me to do so, I need help. Your contribution would help fund my first EP, with my original songs. These songs are meant to bring that old soul back, with flavors of different genres intertwined. I will be headed to Tennessee to record, as well as Detroit for the rest of the production. I plan to create music that will make people feel good, feel chills, and feel loved. I would deeply appreciate your help in contributing to my dream. I can’t wait to bring this new music to you all! </p>

Whether you're a recent college grad, or you've never gone to school in your life, this feeling of uncertainty, fear, and confusion is something that everyone can relate to. The process of writing this album was incredibly healing and helped me cope during a very difficult time in my life. Your support would allow me to share this album with the world, and hopefully help someone who is going through a similar situation. Please donate to help me create this piece of art that is incredibly near and dear to my heart. All of the funds raised for this album will be used to cover promotional costs, compensation for everyone involved in the production of the album, and any extra projects that will go along with the album (music videos, merch, tour, etc). Any donations would be greatly appreciated and would help me get that much closer to achieving one of my lifelong dreams. Every cent counts!</p>

<p><strong>Sarah Khatami</strong> is an Iranian-American singer/songwriter based in Brooklyn, NY. Born and raised in Pittsburgh, PA, Khatami was drawn to R&amp;B icons Aaliyah, Mýa, and Christina Aguilera from a young age. At the same time, her parents' CDs of popular Persian artists Googoosh, Dariush, and Ebi caught her interest, as they constantly played around their house. Influenced heavily by both genres, Khatami developed her own style that combined the smooth, sultry vocals of 90s’-00s’ R&amp;B with the elaborate, yet effortless runs heard in traditional Persian music. Khatami’s lyrics explore a wide variety of relevant topics ranging from relationship ups and downs, to social justice, to the identity issues that many children of immigrants face.

<p><strong>The story of Nergard</strong></p>
<p>Nergard saw the light of day way back in 2010, born within the mind of the Norwegian songwriter Andreas Nergård. He pictured an ambitious project that would unite both local talents and international artists on big scale recordings. Since the beginning Nergard has released two full albums, one remake, two EP’s and two singles with guest performances from well-known artists such as: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Elize Ryd</strong> (Amaranthe) </li>
<li>
<strong>Ralf Scheepers</strong> (Primal Fear, ex-Gamma Ray)</li>
<li>
<strong>Michele Luppi </strong>(Whitesnake)</li>
<li>
<strong>Göran Edman</strong> (ex-Yngwie Malmsteen)</li>
<li>
<strong>Michael Eriksen</strong> (Circus Maximus)</li>
<li>
<strong>Nils K. Rue</strong> (Pagan’s Mind)</li>
<li>
<strong>Mike Vescera</strong> (ex-Yngwie Malmsteen/ex-Loudness)</li>
<li>
<strong>Andi Kravljaca </strong>(Aeon Zen/Thaurorod)</li>
<li>
<strong>Jørn Viggo Lofstad</strong> (Pagan's Mind/Northward) </li>
<li>
<strong>Sanne Mieloo</strong> (Nemesea)</li>
<li>
<strong>Helge Engelke</strong> (Fair Warning)</li>
<li>
<strong>Tony Mills</strong> (ex-TNT/ex-Shy) </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What are you funding?</strong></p>
<p>All income from this campaign goes straight into finalizing the forthcoming concept album Eternal White.  EW is an album based on real events; the tragic story of the Carolean death march and for this one Nergard has taken a new direction going for a grandiose and epic sound centered in the Symphonic Metal genre. The new direction also excludes the many guest singers that have dominated the previous releases. Andreas wanted to make Nergard sound more like a band instead of a guest-project so this time a core of three singers will do the job. One special guest will join us this time; the legendary <strong>Tim ""The Ripper"" Owens</strong>, known from Judas Priest, Iced Earth and Yngwie Malmsteen. </p>
<p>The making of an album is a time consuming and expensive affair: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Salary for musicians</strong></li>
<li><strong>Studio rent</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mixing and mastering the album</strong></li>
<li><strong>Artwork</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cd layout </strong></li>
<li><strong>Music videos </strong></li>
<li><strong>Promotion</strong></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The list goes on. There can never be enough money for making, releasing and promoting an album. It's important to me that every thing about this album is absolutely top notch and I really think I have achieved that with this album, both when it comes to production and songwriting.</p>
<p>The goal for this campaign is to reach <strong>4000 Euros</strong>. As this album is almost done and more than half of the costs have already been covered I can guarantee that your perks will be sent to you in time for the release of Eternal White. The estimated time for delivery is 1st of May 2021. This may change depending on the final release date for the album. You will receive updates on this matter frequently.  </p>

I would really like to help give back to the Vancouver music scene and that will definitely be the focus of our first stretch goal. Closing out: This has been a long time time in the making so all your help in producing a high quality, unique album for anyone to enjoy would be appreciated! If you were at our first show last year, you know that we’ve got some of the best musicians playing this fun music you won’t find anywhere else. Any amount you can contribute helps, but you can also help by coming to the concert on June 15th, and by sharing this campaign with friends and family on social media. Or, if you’re super cool, all of the above!    Thank you so much for your support! Perk-related Disclaimers: Shipping:We have included shipping fees for Canadian and US-based backers on the tiers with a physical tier, but if you live elsewhere and still want those sweet physical goodies, just drop us a line and we'll do our best to accommodate you. For the Space Crate tier, extra shipping costs may apply if you opt for the CD Box option if you are outside the Metro Vancouver area.Fulfillment:We will always make a best-faith effort to fulfill all perks. But should we encounter any significant difficulty in getting your goodies to you, we will do our best do make alternative arrangements to the best of our abilities. As well, for any perks that involves the band, I will try my best to include every member of the band I can but everyone is a busy musician with busy schedules so that is subject to change!Chunk of Space Elevator:If you chose the perk for me to compose a song for your next project, please note that I can fulfill your request within reason, equivalent to a day's worth of work. Should you need more, drop me a line and I will try my best to work out a discounted arrangement!",0.0,2,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Dream</h3>
<p>I am a singer-songwriter, composer, and pianist based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I've got a grand album project in the works, my first working with a studio. It is inspired by the narratives of ancient sagas and musical theater, and infused with a background in classical piano and choral music. It is vulnerable, it is raw, and it is queer. It is called ""Electric Porcelain"". And it needs your help!</p>
<p>I've been busy since relocating to Minnesota in 2015: self-recording and releasing two albums and honing my composing and arranging skills, but most importantly learning to more fully accept my own queer identity. The songs I've written in the past two years delve frankly into the confrontation of queerness with homophobia and heteronormativity, and have coalesced into this album's story of heartbreak and growth.</p>
<p>The album is all planned out, the parts have been composed, rehearsals have begun, the ensemble is forming, and recording dates are in place. But to bring this thing to physicality we’ll need an extra boost! </p>

<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>I conceive of my songs as pieces of larger works. They are chapters in broader stories, waypoints on a long undulating journey. Electric Porcelain is, put simply, a love story. But more intimately, it is an exploration of what it means to live as a queer person in a world, despite its progress, still dominated by heteronormativity. It is filled with vulnerability, flights, falls, heartbreak, triumph, resilience, and growth. It is an epic battle with internalized and externalized homophobia and masculinity. It is the healing of wounds both fresh and re-opened. </span></p>
<p>Alright, deep breath...</p>
<p>Growing up as a gay kid in the rural Midwest, I had little context for my experience aside from shame. Much of my music is a chronicle of the unlearning of that shame. When I look back, I see how far I’ve come. When I look ahead, I see there’s still a lot of work to do. This album is intensely personal. But the experience it describes, that halting, incremental growth, that painful shedding of homophobia’s oppressive exoskeleton, is repeated so often. Electric Porcelain is a hug and “it’s going to get better” to my adolescent-self, and a “hey, me too, we’ll get through this” to all who have been fed such toxicity and are still unlearning and confronting it. <strong>Supporting this project is supporting the existence of more queer art in the world, which is at once an act of healing and resistance. </strong></p>
<p>More selfishly though, you’re helping me realize a DREAM.  While bedroom recordings and home-printed CDs are valuable media for art, I am very excited to take a step in a different direction and work with a studio and release this music more broadly. I will be recording with the incomparable Leo Strei of Tatterwood Gallery at Uptown Church and Northeast United Methodist Church in Minneapolis, and working with a whole gaggle of beautiful soundmakers including a string quartet and a vocal ensemble. And I want to be sure these talented folks are PAID what they deserve, a phenomenon that is not common enough in the arts. It's an ambitious project.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Just a few of those talented folks.</i></p>
<p>I strive to create music that is genuine and heartfelt, that contains a little piece of my being.

This is what you are supporting: the creation of a new album and the fashioning of the little wings that will help it fly. Those little wings are polished tracks, slick packaging, online distribution, promotional materials and the like. (See below for all the costs).</p>
<p>But MOST importantly, this project is important because ART is important in and of itself! Which you all know, because that's what crowdfunding is all about!</p>

<p>“Break My Own Heart”  a song composed and performed by Puerto Rican artist, Xavier Bernazard, will receive its featured length music video, set to premiere in 2021. The project is being developed and produced between Puerto Rico and the United States, by various Puerto Rican independent artists, and directed by filmmaker, Alej Torres.</p>
<p>Singer/songwriter Xavier Bernazard, originated from Caguas, Puerto Rico, and currently resides in Dallas, Texas. He is a classically trained vocalist, composer, and keyboardist. Xavier received a bachelor's degree in Music from Oklahoma State University, and a masters degree in Vocal Performance from the University of North Texas. Xavier grew up in a country that has a diversity of musical genres. His influences stem from Bolero,  Pop, Alternative Rock, Latin Pop, Pop Rock, Classical, and R &amp; B. Xavier is an active performer in the DFW area, and has two original singles on Spotify. “Break My Own Heart” will be his first music video in collaboration with other artists.</p> <p>The video portrays the narrative of the toxic relationship of Anton and Jayden, played by actors Jorge Alexander and Luis Torres. Throughout the video we see how their relationship begins, how it grows, and how it ends. The song exemplifies that sometimes love isn’t enough. As the title conveys, when faced with unrequited love, in order to find your peace, you must break your own heart. </p>
<p>The project seeks to normalize relationships in the LGBTQIA+ community in Puerto Rico. The media frequently portrays the struggle of searching for acceptance in coming out, but seldom exemplifies the struggles of queer relationships. In this video we aim to show the progression of two ill-suited people falling in love. </p>
<p>This collaborative project is produced entirely by independent artists. Given the current global climate, we are seeking donations in order to produce a quality video with fair compensation. We would appreciate any sort of assistance whether it be monetary or simply sharing this incredible message. It's paramount that we bring another perspective to the lives of  LGBTQIA+ individuals.</p>

<h3>I'm LJR, and this is my debut album.</h3>
<p><strong>I'm an indie pop/80's rock singer and composer.</strong> I pull my sound from the artists that inspired me most over the years <strong>(Peter Gabriel, The 1975, Coldplay, Hillsong United, and X Ambassadors)</strong>, and these 12 songs that make up this album are a short window into the past decade of my life. <strong>This theme of this album is the creation of my own identity.</strong> It is also a sharing of the deep loss I felt as I cried out trying to hold on to who I was before, accepting the loss of that person, and in the end finding hope.  Growing up, I looked to other people and communities to tell me who I was, and I desperately clung to that because I was afraid to embrace my own destiny. Now, after many years of self reflection, therapy, heartwork with my family and friends, and unlearning my unhealthy patterns of relating, I feel free for the first time. I'm finally becoming who I was meant to be.</p>
<p><strong>This album is my best work from the past decade</strong>, and represents my first real foray into the music world with my original songwriting and as a lead singer. I've spent years networking and learning the new music business, marketing, video production, audio production, and so much more. I've tried many things, a few of which worked, and most of which failed. With this album and my current promo plan, I think the time is finally here. By the end of this year, I plan to be full time with my music career. However, this won't come easy; there's a long way to go.</p>
<p><strong>Albums are expensive. To do one properly, it can easily be $50,000-$100,000</strong> to finish and promote effectively. This amount covers mixing, mastering, video production, and limited marketing to get it in front of new fans with automated systems to find and keep new listeners.</p>
<p>Alone, I don't know how I could do this. <strong>With your help, however, this is achievable. </strong>I've done everything I can to cut costs (saving over $63K as outlined below), so the goal of this campaign is nowhere near what a typical album will cost<strong> </strong>If we reach the goal of this campaign, not only will we be able to finish creating the actual music on the album, but through the marketing plan I've put together with Spotify playlist promotion, Facebook and Instagram marketing, and working with sync agents (people who get music into TV and movies), it's a real possibility that my music could reach hundreds of thousands of people! </p>

<li>
<strong>$6000 for Facebook and Instagram ads &amp; funnel costs</strong> (critical to actually build a fanbase, without this no one will ever hear the album, covers the first 6 months)</li>
<li>

<li>

<li><strong>Producing, arranging, and playing all tracks myself and with my brother Daniel (saves $10K)</strong></li>
<li>

<h3>The Impact </h3>
<p>There are so many people that are hurting and need hope, especially after this past year. I get so many messages from fans everyday saying how much they are hurting, and I've been shocked and honored when they have expressed how my music has helped them through their divorces, loss of family, cancer, depression, and suicidal thoughts. I never thought my music would have that kind of impact. I hope that these songs will encourage people that they are not alone, and that if I could push through my complete loss of identity, self, and meaning, that they can too.</p>
<p>This is ultimately the impact your contribution will be making on the world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The main challenges here will be in (1) how quickly I can optimize the social media ads to find the right fans and (2), how good the marketing companies are I am partnering with. I've gotten very good results quickly with social media ads before (in less than 1-2 weeks), but some things have changed with Facebook and Instagram so I don't know how that will affect my existing strategies. Since I haven't worked with these marketing companies before, I can't predict exactly what I will get the first round. I've done my best to choose competent companies, so we will see how it goes. I have a good feeling about it. To manage these risks, I'm minimizing my marketing spend by handling as much as I can myself, and because I know how to run basic music marketing campaigns on social media, I'll know when any of my marketing partners don't know what they're doing. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>A brother-sister duo, we founded Outhentic in 2012. Our names are Zhivko Vasilev and Rayna Vasileva, and we are musicians at heart. Outhentic represents the culmination of many years of practice and creative growth, and as we travel the world with our unique musical styling, we could not be any happier with the way that things have gone. Our name – a portmanteau of the words ""out"" and ""authentic"" – expresses our identity clearly, which is always based in authenticity and individuality.</p>
<p>We released our debut self-penned album YesToday in 2016, and it was a hit. Guest performers from locations far and wide collaborated with us, and as much fun as we had putting the album together, we found real joy in just how enthusiastically our audiences received it. That was a major turning point for us: we had already committed ourselves wholeheartedly to our own brand of ethno-jazz, but seeing how many people enjoyed what we were doing, we went back on tour reinvigorated (and immediately started planning for our sophomore album!).</p>
<p>Throughout our journey, we have been fortunate to work with some world-renowned, well-established musicians, including Grammy-nominated bassist Juan Garcia-Herreros, Stoyan Yankoulov, Ian Stevenson, Suchet Mahotra, and Banda Del Padre. Every time we take the stage, we reflect on how far we have come and how deep our vision for the future runs. We are thrilled that we get to continue to produce music, and we are also thrilled to announce that we have started pre-production on another album -<strong>""Transparent""</strong>.</p>
<p>Just as YesToday was a reflection of our duality, drawing on our affinity for the past with our exuberance for the present, [insert name of album here] will be a true and honest look at who we are and what Outhentic has come to mean to us. We continue to combine Bulgarian folk music with modern styles such as jazz, funk, and world in fresh and exciting ways, Zhivko on kaval and piano and Rayna on vocals and percussion. We have already signed up three guests for our new album as well:<br/>* Borislav Iliev (guitar<br/>* Stoil Ivanov (drums)<br/>* Lukas Pamminger (bass guitar)</p>
<p>Based in Sofia, Bulgaria, we will travel to Salzburg, Austria, in order to record our album at White Room Studio alongside music producer Svilen Angelov. ""Transparent"" will feature two original compositions and nine Bulgarian folk songs that we have arranged, putting our own twist on national classics while also producing wholly original music.</p>
<p>As always, we will sing in Bulgarian, but we know that our audience comes from a variety of countries, something that we take great pride in. It is deeply fulfilling for us to know that we are sharing Bulgarian culture with others, some of whom may not have ever experienced it before at all.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Culture of Bulgaria has thrown their support behind our sophomore album, and for that we are very grateful. It means a lot to us to know that our countrymen and countrywomen can look to what we are doing and know that our culture will be carried on into the future. In order to cover all our production costs, though, we need some additional funding. Our goal through this crowdfunding campaign is to raise $5,000. Every dollar helps at this point, and to say thanks to all our contributors, we are offering early access to ""Transparent"", signed copies of ""YesToday"", and merchandise branded with the Outhentic logo, all just our way of recognizing your invaluable contribution to what we are doing.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We have performed internationally, making appearances at European Museum Night 2016, Mini Jazz Fest 2017, Glastonbury Festival 2017, and Jazz Forum Stara Zagora 2018, and since we started Outhentic Foundation in 2018, we have felt more eager than ever to continue on with our mission promoting and spreading Bulgaria traditions. Your support will help us to do that!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>In addition to making a monetary contribution, you can show your support for what we are doing by sharing a link to this campaign with all your friends and family. Know someone who is a fan of jazz? International music? Learning about other cultures? Let them know what Outhentic is doing! We appreciate all your support, both monetary and non-monetary, and we thank you for taking the time to read about our newest album.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>short summary: So its been Close to a Decade since I last stepped foot in a recording studio. I previously played in a local rock band, Endever. Endever was 5 guys who loved playing with each other but as most things happen... Life did. Between families getting started and life pulling members in different directions Endever disbanded. I walked away from music for personal reasons. It is Personal reasons that have resurrected me from the ""dead"". This record is a major therapeutic tool for me. Giving me an outlet and a Door to express and not Dwell on feelings emotions and to reconcile with my own guilt. Music is bringing me back to who I am. The down sided these things cost money to produce and $2500 can be a bit of a chunk when its a unplained expense. Your contributions mean the world to me in helping expedite this process.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What We need! money's approximately $2500 will get this record done. The money goes straight to the production of this album period. It does not go into my pocket it goes into the studio time and to the mixing engineers. This is a massive outlet for me. At the end of the day it is helping me become a better person for myself and the world around me. If you enjoy Red Lights please contribute let me know you like what Im doing and support this album.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I don't go insane and you all get entertained. (And inspired. Am I right!?!?)</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Everything is a risk and a challenge to some degree or another.</p>
<p>We're gonna get this done, and it's going to be a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>I suppose the only risk or challenge would be if you have to patiently wait a few weeks longer than you'd like! </p>

That’s Cool – here is the gist of it all...I am Uriah Duffy, a bass player and musical director from Oakland California and I am finally ready to record my first album. I have some of the Bay Areas most talented musicians ready to hit the studio with me to record some of my original music for your ears!Kicking off this project, on Friday January 17th, in Anaheim CA, I am about to perform with the band from Graham Central Station backing me up with some of my original music. This will take place at the Bass Hang during the NAMM music convention and after we return to the bay we will be hitting the studio hard. Come check us out and let me thank you in person.In order for this album to happen there are some things I need your help with right now: pick a perk and contribute, then spread the word. I would be honored to feel your love and support in this dream of mine. Thanks for being a part of the Bay Area musical history.        For those of you who don’t know me or ever heard me play before, I am a bass player from Oakland and have been very fortunate to tour the world and play with some of the best musicians out there. I have had a bass in my hand for 35 years and have toured and worked with the greats like Whitesnake, Alicia Keys, Prince, Goapale, The Family Stone, Too $hort, Liv Warfield, Starship, Christina Aguilera, Fantastic Negrtio and many more. I have musically directed many artists including Ceelo Green and Lyrics Born. I am also one third of a progressive rock band called Points North.Wikipedia says I am “known for my versatility, with chops ranging from Funk, R&B, Hip-Hop, Rock, Metal and Gospel”. I have been fortunate to play music my whole career and have loved every minute of it. Now I am ready to use the experience I’ve attained to finally create my own original music like so many of my peers and fans have requested from me.             This year, I’m being given the opportunity to headline the Bass Hang during the NAMM music convention and am excited to be bringing some of the funkiest music from the Bay Area down to Anaheim. I’ll be featuring the powerful & historic band Graham Central Station behind me, and I could not be more thrilled. I grew up with the sounds of Larry Graham and his music and am honored that his band is ready and willing to throw down for me. After this show we will be returning home to hit the recording studio. We have been rehearsing some of the original music I intend to record and it sounds ridiculous. We already have the studio selected and will begin the mixing and mastering process ASAP.And it doesn’t stop there. After we record our music, we’ll get to play it for live audiences! My further goal is to get this band on festivals as a beacon of good vibes, funk and celebration for all.                                                  I am looking to raise $15,000 to start. It will take much more to complete this project and to realize my ultimate vision but this will start the ball rolling. Recording an album can be very expensive and an intense labor of love. Here is a break down of what some of the costs are going to look like. At the end of the day its just about making amazing sounding music with amazing musicians I have in my blackbook. For a further breakdown of costs check out the FAQ section below.                                                                   I am so grateful that there is really no limit to what I am willing to give back. But for now this is what I have come up with to give to you for giving to me. Check out the full list --> --> --> --> -->My favorite perk is the ALL ACESS PASS! You get an invitation to my fan page where you get to see behind the scenes footage, live streams, photos and demos and get the most up to date info before it goes out into the world.                                                                                           Music is my life! Being able to record original music with the guys from Graham Central Station is a dream come true. I will finally get to hear the music in my head come to life and move my career forward into the great unknown. I have been in the studio a thousand times recording other peoples music. Now it’s my turn. I can’t wait to work with these incredibly talented musicians.There is no greater joy then making music. I am passionate about my experiences as a bass player and everything I have played thus far has provided me with the skills I have to let the music flow thru me. In short, this album is happening!                       If you are not able to financially contribute, that’s fine. There are other ways you can support that make a huge difference that don’t cost anything. Please share this video far and wide, to your friends and family and on social media. Tell your neighbor, tell your dog, tell your bartender, you never know who is going to show up to help me succeed. I am also accepting help regarding all aspects of the process, donations, advice, a shoulder to cry on and some Baileys.",11.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>About</h3>
<p><strong>Intro</strong></p>
<p>Hey! I'm Katie Sutherland, I'm 13 years old and I'm a singer-songwriter from Los Angeles, California. I'm a goofy, active person with 2 dogs and a brother. :) I'm excited to announce the launch of my first-ever, debut single: ""Every Road I Take."" </p>
<p><strong>Why Music?</strong></p>
<p>As much as I love to be outgoing I could never seem to get myself to do something this bold, but I feel it was an important calling to grasp onto. Music makes me so happy and I regret hiding in my shell for this long. Playing the piano and ukulele, singing and writing music have always brought me great joy. The fact that I am able to even write this song is a blessing that I am forever grateful for. I look up to so many fantastic artists that have great voices and are so unique. I hope to touch people in the same way so many did to me. I also hope to encourage others to stay faithful through everything, good and bad. God has planned things for a reason and I hope to show those in darkness that He is the light. Once again, I love being able to worship, and for those who are shying away, just think how many lives you could possibly touch with one simple verse of a song.</p>
<p><strong>Campaign Reach</strong></p>
<p>I want this to be a growing experience. I am so extremely thankful for this and words can’t explain all the things I am feeling. I am confident the Lord will use this to reach unbelievers and even those who are simply just lost with no where to turn. This song is saying that following God is nothing but easy and when we get distracted with the things of this world and try to run he still finds a way to bring us back to that road that we should’ve been taking all along. All in all He is the only thing we need and the only thing that is important. We need to share what so many people are unaware of and stand strong. Once again this isn’t easy, but we need not be ashamed. Jesus sure wasn’t ashamed to share God’s amazing word while on earth and that’s what he asks for us. I find that through my daily life I have a constant struggle to not follow his path. This song has reassured and reminded me that He has put these words into my mouth for a reason and I’m curious, and excited to see what it’s going to turn into. </p>

For fans of The Cramps, Iggy Pop, Blondie, Queens of the Stone Age, and The Distillers - expect a face full of bash to knock your ass straight from the stage to the pit. Following her recent unreleased single Hot Wired, a romping motorcycle of modern melody infused with vintage vibes and velvety vocals, Vallely has been given the rare opportunity to travel with a full band of miscreants to the legendary Rancho de la Luna in Joshua Tree, Ca. The Rancho is the analog temple of sound built by desert visionary Fred Drake. Since Drake's untimely passing it is now the residence of the esteemed engineer and producer Dave Catching alongside his mojave shamans who have tended to this altar of recording for the likes of The Eagles of Death Metal, Queens of the Stone Age, Kyuss, Iggy Pop, Foo Fighters, Arctic Monkeys, Fu Manchu and many more.  <br/><br/>Vallely has been performing across the globe for over a decade with bands such as Midnight Larks, Spindrift, The Silver Chords, The Mobsters and The Warlocks, guested with The Brian Jonestown Massacre, Mondo Generator, Lords of Altamont, King Adora and members of QOTSA, The Hives, Portishead, Massive Attack, Cat Power, Bauhaus, Love and Rockets, Masters of Reality, The Seeds, The Black Angels, Gong, Dead Meadow, Entrance Band, Yahowha 33 and Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedys along with many others.<br/> <br/>Vallely has also performed at many major festivals such as Atlanta's Sweetwater 420 Fest, PBR Fest and Music Midtown where she performed alongside such acts as Bruno Mars and Mumford &amp; Sons.

She has earned opening slots for acts such as Cypress Hill, Kid Rock, Run The Jewels, Awolnation, Mastodon, NOFX, The Black Angels, Santigold, Black Mountain, Dead Meadow, Flaming Groovies, Strawberry Alarm Clock, King Khan, Shannon and The Clams, Night Beats, Biters and The Coathangers.  Vallely composed and performed on many independent and feature film scores such as El Gringo starring Christian Slater, has directed many music videos, and produced and starred in the documentary Spindrift, Ghost of The West.<br/> <br/>After the tragic loss of her drummer Tony (2 Skulls) Dinneweth, Vallely began co-writing and recording two songs with Tuk Smith of Biters and breaking away from the two piece with a full band, Amy Epperley on bass, both Cullen Curtis and Ben Davidow on guitar, and Jason Monseur on drums.<br/><br/>Vallely and her band have individually sacrificed, out-of-pocket and have put any and all money they make from shows and merch sales towards funding this endeavor.

It's not an exaggeration to say I grew up in recording studios and later built several with my late father, Larry Swist. This background has enhanced my sensibility of the varied roles of studio owner, acoustic designer, recording engineer, producer, arranger, film scorer, composer, and most importantly: performer.</p><p>My recordings mix both solos and collaborations and Standing Wave will feature the heightened performances of Marcia Lehninger, Amy Williams, Craig Bitterman, Jose Lezcano, and Barry Nagel. Capturing honest and virtuosic performance is one of our priorities and EvenFall Studio has been designed to be a live ""performance"" room that rewards contemporary technique.</p><p>The studio was built for composers and performers to be free of hourly fees and deadline constraints of more commercial studios. The facility will be ideal for non-profit and endowment work that is committed to an artistic means, rather than a commercial one.

Beach had long wished to write an opera on an American subject, and eventually found a play by her friend Nan Bagby Stephens which reimagines the story of historical figure Pierre Lafitte, a ‘gentleman pirate’ who escaped imprisonment in New Orleans during the British-American War of 1812 before helping General Andrew Jackson to power. Beach began work on <i>Cabildo</i> in 1932, but her progress was delayed during the difficult years that followed, and it was only in February 1945 that the opera premiered, two months after her death. Despite its importance as one of first operas by an American woman, and its richly textured musical style fusing folk songs, Creole music, and art-song, <i>Cabildo</i> is rarely performed today. </p><p>The opera tells the story of a contemporary tour group visiting the cell where Lafitte was imprisoned. While the tourists celebrate Lafitte and his achievements, one of them dreams up the story of his escape from the cell, bringing a romanticised past to life on stage. Emma Jude Harris' staging will honour the pioneering spirit of Beach’s music whilst also interrogating the dirty underside of the American dream she portrays. Recognising that Pierre Lafitte was a slave trader as well as a war hero, the production will raise questions about nationalism and how nostalgia blinds us.</p><p>Our production will take place at Dalston’s Arcola Theatre as part of Grimeborn Festival, which has been subverting audiences' expectations of opera for the past 13 years.

Last year, of 1,445 classical concerts performed worldwide, only 76 (5%) included a piece by a woman.

My goal for my next album, <i>Folk Songs, Jazz Journeys</i>, is to explore beyond the limits of those conceptions, and to bring you along on the trip. As you will hear, my notion of what constitutes “folk music” is expansive, crossing many borders, so we’ll travel far.</p><p>As a jazz guitarist and composer born in Brittany, the Celtic region of western France, and raised mostly in Piedmont North Carolina, I have always been drawn to both tradition and innovation in music. The more I listen to and the deeper I immerse myself in my home traditions and others, especially those of Brazil and West Africa, the more I realize that tradition and innovation are far from opposites: traditional music, at its best, is relentlessly innovative, and jazz, a genre often thought of as pure innovation, continually renews itself by drawing on its core African and Caribbean traditions and, increasingly, those of other cultures as well.</p><p>In my musical projects and performances these days I am working not just with the familiar jazz trio of guitar, bass, and drums but also with singer-songwriters and musicians from West African and Indian classical traditions who bring instruments like balafon and tabla to my original compositions and arrangements of folk melodies. The three tracks I have already recorded for <i>Folk Songs, Jazz Journeys</i>—the Appalachian ballad “Wayfaring Stranger”; my setting of “Viceversa,” a poem by the Uruguayan writer Mario Benedetti; and “Postal de Bata,” which I wrote after a trip to Equatorial Guinea—are first steps in these explorations and feature vocalist and songwriter Maya Rogers, bassist Tyler Sherman, drummer Keith Butler Jr., and multi-instrumentalist Uasuf Gueye on balafon (West African marimba).</p><p>Other compositions and arrangements will cover a similarly wide range and draw on the talents of some of the Washington, DC, area’s finest musicians approaching jazz from diverse perspectives. For example, my arrangement of “Asa branca,” one of the most famous songs from the folk tradition of rural northeastern Brazil, will feature friends from DC’s Brazilian jazz and popular music scene (some of whom I recorded with on my first CD, <i>Nostalgia da Terra Incógnita</i> [2007]), as will my composition “Triângulo,” inspired by the same tradition of northeast Brazilian <i>forró</i>. My arrangement of “Le temps des cerises,” a nineteenth-century French song long associated with resistance to oppression, is an homage to my French grandmother, who learned it as a young woman in Nazi-occupied Paris. My composition “The Kudzu, the Dust, and You” is a blues ballad that recalls the dirt-road landscapes of my North Carolina childhood. I also plan to include an arrangement of a Breton Celtic melody on this recording.</p><p>I already have been blessed by many creative and supportive hands as we begin to bring this project to life. By adding yours, you will enable a unique set of musical confluences to reach a broader public, through the physical CD, streaming sites, and the increased performance opportunities that a new recording can make possible. The energy in the studio recording the first three tracks was unlike any I’d felt in my musical career. Songwriter jazz? Jazz balafon? Something new here wants to be born.

<h3>THE STORY OF ""MAD"" by Bella DeLong</h3>
<p>Hey! My name is Bella DeLong and I’m an artist born and raised in Helena, Montana. I grew up as the kid of two acting teachers and was lucky enough to be immersed in the art world at a very early age, I became obsessed. The obsession is still alive and well, and my close friends will tell you that witnessing, talking about, and creating art are still the only things that really light me up and make me feel alive.</p>
<p>I think I learned that obsession from my father. He was a true renaissance man. An actor, director, dancer, fencer, singer, designer, writer… the list goes on. Some of my earliest memories consist of him sitting me down to have “listening sessions” in which we would go through a Beatles album and he would break down the dynamics of it. </p>
<p>After he passed away in 2017 the music I’d been hoarding inside of me for all that time just bubbled over. I’d hear songs playing in my head and start writing them down, singing them, learning how to play them. Eventually, I was able to meet a couple of really talented friends that we're able to help me with production- and I’ve been in the pursuit of realizing these creative projects ever since! </p>
<p> My father was an artistic force of nature, and the void that was left by him made me realize how much the creative process and being around creative people means to me.</p>
<p>That fulfillment has only been reaffirmed by working on my latest project “MAD”. </p>
<p>I was lucky enough to have Cyrus Elia produce the track, he’s about to graduate USC with a degree in music production. He’s had so much experience there producing, playing on,  and writing songs for so many groups and up and coming artists- I feel like his expertise really elevated this song.  He really captured its spirit; fun, a little silly, a little sexy,  a little sad. </p>
<p>Now, this incredible music video crew and I are working to really TURN OUT the visual experience that will go along with what Cyrus and I have made. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need money to make this vision come true on-screen, and there are some awesome rewards to choose from when you contribute at any level! This entire team is here working to realize the full potential of this story we’ve created. We’re ambitious, resourceful, and determined- and we think this visual and sonic explosion of self-loathing will leave us with skills to be better creators, better people, and with a product that makes people feel fun and understood! (funderstood???) Isn’t that what making art is all about?</p>
<p>I understand the value of your time, your money, and your attention and I absolutely don’t take it for granted. I’ve seen what life is like without music and creativity- and it’s simply unbearable. I may not be able to promise what comes after the making of this project, but I am sure that nothing in the world means more to this team and me than having the opportunity to do the things that make us LIVE. That’s really what you’re providing, the opportunity for young artists to be really alive. In return, we hope to provide you with a product that will, hopefully, make you feel the same way. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>If you can't contribute now...</h3>
<p>If you can’t contribute now, sharing the page would be incredible. And keep an eye out for the song and video! Follow our Instagram pages, etc. we can be friends. :) We’re all creators beginning our journeys in the world of entertainment, and I’m sure we’re all people you’ll want to watch and remember. ;)</p>

The obsession is still alive and well, and my close friends will tell you that witnessing, talking about, and creating art are still the only things that really light me up and make me feel alive.
I think I learned that obsession from my father. He was a true renaissance man. An actor, director, dancer, fencer, singer, designer, writer… the list goes on. Some of my earliest memories consist of him sitting me down to have “listening sessions” in which we would go through a Beatles album and he would break down the dynamics of it. 
After he passed away in 2017 the music I’d been hoarding inside of me for all that time just bubbled over. I’d hear songs playing in my head and start writing them down, singing them, learning how to play them. Eventually, I was able to meet a couple of really talented friends that we're able to help me with production- and I’ve been in the pursuit of realizing these creative projects ever since! 
 My father was an artistic force of nature, and the void that was left by him made me realize how much the creative process and being around creative people means to me.
That fulfillment has only been reaffirmed by working on my latest project “MAD”. 
I was lucky enough to have Cyrus Elia produce the track, he’s about to graduate USC with a degree in music production. He’s had so much experience there producing, playing on,  and writing songs for so many groups and up and coming artists- I feel like his expertise really elevated this song.  He really captured its spirit; fun, a little silly, a little sexy,  a little sad. 
Now, this incredible music video crew and I are working to really TURN OUT the visual experience that will go along with what Cyrus and I have made. 

What We Need & What You Get
We need money to make this vision come true on-screen, and there are some awesome rewards to choose from when you contribute at any level! This entire team is here working to realize the full potential of this story we’ve created. We’re ambitious, resourceful, and determined- and we think this visual and sonic explosion of self-loathing will leave us with skills to be better creators, better people, and with a product that makes people feel fun and understood! (funderstood???) Isn’t that what making art is all about?
I understand the value of your time, your money, and your attention and I absolutely don’t take it for granted. I’ve seen what life is like without music and creativity- and it’s simply unbearable. I may not be able to promise what comes after the making of this project, but I am sure that nothing in the world means more to this team and me than having the opportunity to do the things that make us LIVE. That’s really what you’re providing, the opportunity for young artists to be really alive. In return, we hope to provide you with a product that will, hopefully, make you feel the same way. 

If you can't contribute now...
If you can’t contribute now, sharing the page would be incredible. And keep an eye out for the song and video! Follow our Instagram pages, etc. we can be friends. :) We’re all creators beginning our journeys in the world of entertainment, and I’m sure we’re all people you’ll want to watch and remember. ;)

<h3>Who we are and what we'll do</h3>
<p>MDI is one of the major contemporary music ensembles in Italy. Mauro Lanza and Andrea Valle are among the most creative composers on the European scene, especially known for their Systema Nauturae 80' cycle for ensemble and electromechanical devices.<br/>After having put together one of most successful live shows on the Italian contemporary music scene in 2018, with the Italian première of Systema Naturae cycle in front of 200 people, they are now willing to record it on CD for the first time, in collaboration with the prestigious Stradivarius label and RepertorioZero.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why do we need your support?</h3>
<p>Recording such a huge work requires a huge equipment but more importantly: time and space.<br/>Despite the recording will be not made out of a live performance, every object and every instrument requires a specific work from the sound engineer, and we need space and time to build up the whole setup in a recording studio and to keep it there until we're finished and happy with it. Don't forget that 80 computer controlled objects and 10 musicians are involved for more than 80 minutes of great music!!</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why the recording</h3>
<p>Systema Naturae has never been fully recorded before, and not even video recorded in its entirety. It's a hard piece to program for artistic directors and festivals because of the energies and the economical effort that the setup requires. However, it's an amazing experience for audiences, as proven by the amazing success for the Italian première in October 2018 in Milan. <br/>We strongly believe that this piece deserves a studio recording that will increase our possibilities to bring this wonderful experience to more and more audiences! Moreover, it would be the first ever monographic CD dedicated to Mauro Lanza's music, another reason to make this project real.<br/>Have a look to what we did in Milan: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hp1mtWT6NOg&amp;t=6s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.youtube.com/watch?v=hp1mtWT6NOg&amp;amp;t=6s</a></p>

<h3>About Us &amp; The Album </h3>
<p>Hi, thanks for coming to our presale page! Here is a little bit about us, Ryan Schilling and I (Christy Lynn) have been writing songs together since we met in 2011. We share a great appreciation for American roots music, taking influence from an eclectic mix of country, folk, and rock n' roll musicians. Sweetheart of the Radio is a collection of 12 brand new country-tinged songs we've written over the last 2 years. The new album has tales of heartbreak and abandonment, an outlaw’s last wishes before the hangman’s noose, a country star’s hidden grief behind the airwaves of her radio success, and more! </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The new album has been recorded, mixed, and mastered and we are truly thrilled with the outcome. It has been a long journey since we started the process earlier this year and your contribution will help us overcome the expensive production process that lies ahead. </span></p>

<p><strong>Style of music/Genre…</strong></p>
<p>To describe my style of music I chose to ask my Mixer and Master, and to my surprise he labeled my music as Pop/Rock/Folk.</p>
<p><strong>Music Inspired By...</strong></p>
<p>As all music is inspired by life experience of the artist, mine is no different. My music is inspired by my aspirations to share my voice, hope, visions, and peace with the world. From my many years of transformational play, spiritual journeying, and meditation I have found a deep peace that continues to build and be with me. I hope that my lyrics will invite the listener to connect deeper to self, nature, the world, and one’s heart. My mission is to open hearts to love and to remind people of their value and power to create. I hope my music will meet you and take you for a ride to live a full and joyous life!</p>
<p><strong>How it can make you feel…</strong></p>
<p>As I spoke of a bit before, my intention is that my music will increase the love, peace, freedom, clarity, prosperity, and joy in your life, and help you relax and find your soul groove.</p>

Num meio conservador e tradicionalista como o fado, tivemos necessidade de inventar um lugar onde pudéssemos criar novas narrativas e explorar diferentes expressões e possibilidades para os nossos corpos e as nossas vozes, que não cabiam nos moldes expectáveis.Fado Bicha is a music band and an artivism project.We are soulful musicians and activists by choice. In a conservative and traditionalist environment like Fado, we needed to invent a place where we could create new narratives and explore different expressions and possibilities for our bodies and voices, which did not fit the normative pattern. Fotografia: Teresa Lopes da Silva As histórias de pessoas LGBTI (e, no geral, as histórias de resistência, opressão e crítica social relacionadas com as minorias sexuais, étnicas, económicas) estavam interditas ao fado, pelo conservadorismo e pelo hábito, e nós quisemos ver-nos retratados no que fazíamos, não subliminarmente mas por inteiro.Começámos o Fado Bicha em 2017. Somos o Tiago Lila (nome de palco: Lila Fadista) e o João Caçador. Já demos mais de 150 concertos, a maioria em Portugal, mas também em Espanha, em França, na Bélgica e no Luxemburgo. Fomos atores num filme independente e num musical criado pelo Teatro Praga e apresentado no São Luiz. Já demos palestras na Universidade de Coimbra e na Universidade do Porto. Tocámos nas Marchas e/ou festas do Orgulho de Lisboa, Bragança, Porto, Viseu e do Funchal e criámos uma festa temática periódica, em que convidamos outros artistas e pensadores de Lisboa.The stories of LGBTI people (and generally the stories of resistance, oppression, and social critique related to sexual, ethnic, economic minorities) were blocked out from fado, by conservatism, and habit, and we wanted to be represented in what we did, not subliminally but fully.We started Fado Bicha in 2017. We are Tiago Lila (stage name: Lila Fadista) and João Caçador. We have played over 150 concerts, mostly in Portugal, but also in Spain, France, Belgium and Luxembourg. We were actors in an independent film and in a musical created by Teatro Praga and performed at São Luiz. We have delivered lectures at University of Coimbra and University of Porto. We played at the Lisbon, Bragança, Porto, Viseu and Funchal Prides and created a periodic themed event, in which we invite other Lisbon artists and thinkers. Fotografia: Aline Macedo Neste momento, estamos a trabalhar com o músico eletrónico Moullinex, que está a produzir o nosso álbum e precisamos do vosso apoio para que isso aconteça. Não quisemos até agora associar-nos a uma editora; queremos ter controlo total sobre a nossa criação e a forma como nos apresentamos. Assumirmo-nos como músicos independentes, avessos à lógica de mercado e anticorrente tem os seus riscos. Sabemos porque estamos aqui e que marca queremos deixar, que caminho queremos desenvolver.We are currently working with electronic musician Moullinex, who is producing our album and we need your support to make that happen. So far we have not wanted to associate ourselves with a record label as we want total control over our creation and the way we present ourselves. Assuming ourselves as independent musicians, averse to market logic and anti-current has its risks. We know why we are here and what footprint we want to leave, the path we want to take. Fotografia: Aline Macedo Esta campanha que levamos a cabo destina-se a ajudar-nos a cobrir os custos de produção, gravação e edição do álbum, a sair em Abril de 2020; de realização de três videoclipes para as nossas músicas, em colaboração com outros artistas e com o objetivo de criar narrativas visuais queer e relevantes; e da criação de músicas novas.This crowdfunding campaign is designed to help us cover the costs of our first album production, recording and editing, expected by April 2020; directing three music videos for our songs, in collaboration with other artists, creating queer and relevant visual narratives; and the creation of new songs. Fotografia: Francisco Neves De uma forma muito concisa, é isto. Ajudar-nos a criar para que consigamos não só realizar tudo isto como estabelecer uma plataforma que nos permita chegar a uma maior sustentabilidade do nosso trabalho através da visibilidade da nossa obra e do nosso compromisso - convosco e com a cultura queer portuguesa. O bolo total do dinheiro que esta campanha pede distribui-se da seguinte forma:A- Produção, gravação, edição e promoção do álbum a ser lançado em Abril 2020 (inclui despesas com direitos autorais de músicas, convites a músicos adicionais, masterização externa, licenciamentos fonográficos, etc) - 11.000 eurosB- Três Videoclips a realizar entre novembro 2019 e março 2020 - 8.000 eurosC- Criação de novas músicas - 6.000 euros Very concisely, this is it. To help us create so that we can not only accomplish all this but also establish a platform that will allow us to achieve greater sustainability of our work the visibility of our music and our commitment - with us, with you and with the queer Portuguese culture. The total amount of money this campaign is asking for is distributed as follows:A- Production, recording, editing and promotion of the album to be launched in April 2020 (including authorship rights for some songs, invitations to additional musicians, external mastering, phonographic licensing, etc.) - 11.000 euros B- Three video clips to be directed between November 2019 and March 2020 - 8,000 eurosC- Creation of new songs - 6,000 euros Fotografia: Carla Rosado Como contrapartida para quem nos quiser e puder apoiar temos um pouco de tudo! Desde o álbum autografado ou uma t-shirt Fado Bicha com o design da Ana Filipa Olímpio; até outras propostas mais originais para quem conseguir apoiar-nos mais expressivamente - um ensaio assistido e partilhado (quem sabe, um dueto impromptu!), uma sessão de maquilhagem criativa connosco e com a nossa maquilhadora Cris Severo, um jantar caseiro feito por nós (aviso: necessariamente vegano e delicioso) ou mesmo uma massagem a quatro mãos (as nossas!!) há de tudo!E queremos mesmo conhecer-vos e partilhar estas experiências convosco porque, para além de estarem a possibilitar que o nosso trabalho avance e se diversifique, fazemos todxs parte de uma comunidade que precisa de se fortalecer pela abertura ao outro, da partilha e da comunicação positiva. As a retribution for those who want and can support us we have some perks to give away. From the autographed album or a Fado Bicha t-shirt with the design of Ana Filipa Olímpio; to some more original proposals for those who can support us more expressively - an assisted and shared rehearsal (maybe an impromptu duet!), a creative make-up session with us and our make-up artist Cris Severo, a home made dinner cooked by ourselves (warning:  vegan and delicious) or even a four hands massage (ours!!): there is a little bit of everything! And we really want to get to know you as well and truly share these experiences with you. Besides supporting our work and creative vision, helping us to grow and diversify our reach, we are all part of a community which needs unity to strengthen our openness to each other, sharing and positive communication. Fotografia: Aline Macedo A contribuição das pessoas que se identificam com o nosso trabalho - e, de certa forma, com a nossa urgência em realizá-lo - é fundamental, neste momento, para que consigamos atingir estes objetivos nos próximos seis meses.Se gostarias de ajudar mas não tens capacidade financeira para contribuir com dinheiro, podes dar um apoio preciosíssimo divulgando a campanha, fazendo com que chegue a mais pessoas, pessoas que até podem nem fazer ideia de que existimos! Conhece-nos um pouco melhor através de alguns dos nossos vídeos. Até já! The contribution of the people who identify themselves with our work - and, to some extent, with our urgency to do it - is crucial now so that we can achieve all these beautiful goals within the next six months.Have a look at the perks page and contribute if you can. If you would like to support us but do not have financial availability, you can still share this crowdfunding project among your friends helping us to reach as many people as possible.

<h3>Hi, we call ourselves j &amp; p . . . </h3>
<p>Thanks for taking a moment to watch our video* and check out our campaign. We are thrilled to launch this project and <i>FINALLY </i>record some of our new tunes to share with <u>you</u> in the new year.  We are two friends who have been creating music together for nearly three years, mostly long-distance. In-between work shifts and cups of coffee, we have cultivated a practice of sending voice memos back and forth from our iPhones with new melodies and chord progressions. This past year, we lived in the same city and started exploring our faith journey through music. We wrote a lot, played a little (small local shows), and think it's about time to capture the magic with recording.</p>
<p>In 2020, we have the opportunity to record three songs with <a href=""http://www.aaronleeaiken.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Aaron Aiken</a> in his studio outside of Los Angeles. In order to make this dream a reality, we need your help. (Aaron produced P's <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/track/2TI1BUjoapBMqT8iMKz3qz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Kingdom Come""</a> in 2016.)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Here's the breakdown . . . </h3>
<p>Let's be honest. <strong><i>A good recording is expensive</i>. </strong>There's no way around it. It takes great talent, time, and skilled attentiveness to capture each song. Aaron and his team are exceptional professionals who do outstanding work in their field. They are honest, respectful, and kind partners. We are excited to work with him! We strongly believe in financial transparency, so here's what it's going to take to do this project well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Production - $2250</li>
<li>Mixing/Mastering  - $1650</li>
<li>Additional Session Musicians (Drums/Bass) - $975</li>
<li>Professional Marketing (Photo/Graphics) - $650</li>
<li>Perks (CDs, Photo + Lyric Books, etc.) - $350 to $500, depending </li>
<li>Travel/Flights/Accommodations for Recording in California - about $800</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional funds raised will act as a safety net for additional recording fees, INDIEGOGO platform fees, &amp; music distribution company fees (hosting on Spotify/Apple Music/etc.). Any funds beyond that will go towards recording a fourth tune. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Why . . . </h3>
<p>We've had a lot of fun writing these tunes and curating this first album about the journey of being human. These songs are an invitation to explore your own process of longing, desire, healing, gentleness, and freedom. This EP has been a marker in our lives and we hope it holds the same power for you.<br/><br/><i>*SPECIAL THANKS TO STEPHANIE LOHN (@smlohn) FOR CAPTURING VIDEO FOOTAGE FOR US!

I’m <a href=""http://lisabmusic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lisa B (Lisa Bernstein)</a>, a jazz singer with five well-received records released from 1999 to 2011 and ""I Get A Kick: Cole Porter Reimagined"" just out on the Jazzed Media label. I’m also a poet, </strong>with a book published by a prestigious university press, publications in 60+ literary journals, and creative writing fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, Headlands Center for the Arts, and others.</p></div><div>
<p><strong>This campaign, now complete, is helping to  launch my sixth record, “I Get A Kick: Cole Porter Reimagined.”</strong> I’m thrilled that after five releases on my own label, this new one was released January 19, 2018 on <a href=""http://jazzedmedia.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jazzed Media</a>, a widely respected boutique jazz label that’s released 75 records and five videos since its founding in 2002, including Grammy nominations for vocalists and instrumentalists.</p>
<h3>Please check out the record, whether a physical CD or mp3s or streams, at retail outlets everywhere, or directly via my website (see link just below).</h3>
<h3><i><strong>If you're interested in any of the perks at right, please contact me directly at<a href=""http://lisabmusic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> lisabmusic.com</a>.</strong></i></h3>
<p>This campaign, now ended, was hugely rewarding personally, teaching me a great deal, and showing me that I had an authentic, enthusiastic, and generous community of supporters. The amount raised exceeds that for 95% of the music projects on Indiegogo ending at the same time (a helpful benchmark).</p>
<p><strong>These 10 classic songs by Cole Porter, and our creative versions of them, are hip, entertaining, romantic, exotic, playful, and deeply expressive.</strong>  “I Get A Kick Out of You,” “What Is This Thing Called Love?,” “In the Still of the Night” – you’ve heard them before from artists like Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald, but you’ve never heard them like this. I believe you'll love them. </p>

<p><strong>This record is a breakthrough for me.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For the first time I’ll have robust distribution to North American and some international stores, including their online storefronts (and people still do buy hard-copy CDs). You can still find it on Amazon, iTunes, and all the ways you find music online today, plus my own website. </li>
<li>The Jazzed Media signing will help more listeners find out about this music.</li>
<li>My previous records were mainly originals, while this one focuses completely – in an original way –  on the great American songwriter Cole Porter, which will attract the attention of his many fans.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>So Why Cole Porter?</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506826429/j9cl2aaqwtjtdtsdmdzo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>When I first started singing, among the first songs I performed were Cole Porter’s</strong> “Night and Day” and “Easy to Love” (both are on this record). Porter, who wrote hundreds of songs for stage and screen from 1929 to 1954, is unusual among the greats in the Great American Songbook because he wrote both words <i>and</i> music rather than working with a collaborator.</p>
<p><strong>As a poet and lyricist, I was drawn to his concise, evocative, witty lyrics.</strong> Hovering between speech and poetry, they conjure up a range of emotion: heartache and wisecrack, hot and cool, sorrow and the sublime. And I made sure to give you almost all of them in each song: intro verses, all the choruses, even the censored parts. </p>
<p><strong>As a songwriter, I swoon</strong> for his gorgeous melodies and chords.</p>

</div></div>","Hello, and thanks for coming here! I’m Lisa B (Lisa Bernstein), a jazz singer with five well-received records released from 1999 to 2011 and ""I Get A Kick: Cole Porter Reimagined"" just out on the Jazzed Media label. I’m also a poet, with a book published by a prestigious university press, publications in 60+ literary journals, and creative writing fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, Headlands Center for the Arts, and others.
This campaign, now complete, is helping to  launch my sixth record, “I Get A Kick: Cole Porter Reimagined.” I’m thrilled that after five releases on my own label, this new one was released January 19, 2018 on Jazzed Media, a widely respected boutique jazz label that’s released 75 records and five videos since its founding in 2002, including Grammy nominations for vocalists and instrumentalists.
Please check out the record, whether a physical CD or mp3s or streams, at retail outlets everywhere, or directly via my website (see link just below).
If you're interested in any of the perks at right, please contact me directly at lisabmusic.com.
This campaign, now ended, was hugely rewarding personally, teaching me a great deal, and showing me that I had an authentic, enthusiastic, and generous community of supporters. The amount raised exceeds that for 95% of the music projects on Indiegogo ending at the same time (a helpful benchmark).
These 10 classic songs by Cole Porter, and our creative versions of them, are hip, entertaining, romantic, exotic, playful, and deeply expressive.  “I Get A Kick Out of You,” “What Is This Thing Called Love?,” “In the Still of the Night” – you’ve heard them before from artists like Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald, but you’ve never heard them like this. I believe you'll love them. 

This record is a breakthrough for me.

For the first time I’ll have robust distribution to North American and some international stores, including their online storefronts (and people still do buy hard-copy CDs). You can still find it on Amazon, iTunes, and all the ways you find music online today, plus my own website. 
The Jazzed Media signing will help more listeners find out about this music.
My previous records were mainly originals, while this one focuses completely – in an original way –  on the great American songwriter Cole Porter, which will attract the attention of his many fans.

So Why Cole Porter?

When I first started singing, among the first songs I performed were Cole Porter’s “Night and Day” and “Easy to Love” (both are on this record). Porter, who wrote hundreds of songs for stage and screen from 1929 to 1954, is unusual among the greats in the Great American Songbook because he wrote both words and music rather than working with a collaborator.
As a poet and lyricist, I was drawn to his concise, evocative, witty lyrics. Hovering between speech and poetry, they conjure up a range of emotion: heartache and wisecrack, hot and cool, sorrow and the sublime. And I made sure to give you almost all of them in each song: intro verses, all the choruses, even the censored parts. 
As a songwriter, I swoon for his gorgeous melodies and chords.
As a singer, I want to dive into his first-person stories, expressing every heartrending or  diverting comma and note.
And as a contemporary person coping with this world, I want to express that poignant Porter position of being both the ultimate insider and yet the lonely outsider, part of the in crowd yet still the observer.

""A True American Original""
What I didn’t want to do with this material is what so many have done already. So, in ways that reveal new essences of the material, this record boldly reimagines 10 of Cole Porter’s classic songs.

This music could be a delightful new soundtrack to your life.

<p><strong>Why now? </strong>Dude, trust me... It's been an uphill battle. Being an independent artist comes with the creative freedom to do whatever I want, but it also means that everything I do comes out of my own pocket. No major label, no big bucks.

<p><strong>Even though</strong> I have the most the supportive parents anyone could ask for, and a manager and friend who took a chance on me because he believed in my potential as a popstar, I've come to a major roadblock financially and that is why I've decided to swallow my pride and ask for help.</p>
<p><strong>I have plans, BIG plans,</strong> to do some incredible things. The album is almost finished but in order to give it a fighting chance in breaking the music industry, I need to hire the right people to properly market my album in hopes of it getting through all the noise.

<p><strong>$10,000?</strong> Yup, and that won't even cover it all. Even though I've been blessed to have received grants and awards throughout my career, it's never enough.

</li>
<li>Hiring a web designer to overhaul my website</li>
<li>Physical marketing assets (CD and vinyl copies of House Arrest)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Investing in an artist can be risky</b> and I'm very confident in this album and what I have to offer, but I can never predict what people are going to resonate with even if I tried to follow every single trend in pop music. Even the greatest artists have duds. </p>
<p>However, I've been doing this long enough to know that money plays a big factor in the success of a song. If I had a major label's marketing dollars to get every major radio station to play my song on the hour, every hour, on the day of release, I'd be off to the races. <strong>I wouldn't give you the choice NOT to like my music. </strong></p>

I feel so grateful!So here is the long and the short of it :) 
I'm running this campaign to help me earn the money I need (while staying home with my boys!) to pay for the equipment to be able to make these dreams a reality!
Your contributions will allow my music to be dispersed to and inspire a world-wide audience!  
Plus, you'll get lots of great music in return - check out the perks!
For more details - read on! :) What is NeededWith the miracles in modern technology, more is possible than ever before! However, technological miracles don't come cheap. Here's what I'm looking for:
A computer that's up to the task of being the ""brain"" of my studio is critical. That's the most expensive piece too.
A keyboard with some ""body"" (weighted keys that feel like a real piano) is the next most important, and the next most expensive. 
Then there's the ""soul"" of my studio setup, the software that I use to record/edit, and that takes what I play on the keyboard and makes it sound like real instruments -- all sorts of instruments! This is actually the piece I'm most excited about. Here's a video demo of one of the software programs:

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hello my friends. I haven't run a crowd funding campaign in over 7 years.  For the first album in many years, LEMONADE will be released with major label distribution on Fishhead/Warner Brothers, the label that released my first Grammy nominated album ""HOLDIN' GROUND"". What this campaign will do is help pay for release expenses including a MAJOR Nashville PR firm, Tour support for the band to do festivals and Radio support across MANY genres. Come on out and have a glass of ""LEMONADE"" with us.</li>
<li>Many of you know me from the many albums I've played on and the artists I've played with. That group has included Steve Winwood, Lou Gramm, Joe Lynn  Turner, Clarence Clemmons, Rodney Atkins Jimmy Wayne and many more over a 4 decade career, and many of you know me from my Contemporary Blues albums, which have all charted and been on radio for twenty years.</li>
<li>LEMONADE is amazing because it was done at the magical Dockside Studios in Maurice, LA with the most amazing musicians I've played with since Steve Winwood. Bob Malone on keyboards(Solo Artist, John Fogerty, Ringo, The Grinch) Doug Belotte on drums ( Jerry Douglas,Sonny Landreth, Rickie Lee Jones, Eric Clapton, Joe Sample) and Carl Dufrene Jr. on bass (Anders Osbourne, North Mississippi All Stars, Tab Benoit)</li>
<li>The production and technical crew on LEMONADE are beyond belief</li>
<li>JoeBaby Michaels and I produced the CD</li>
<li>Josh Fairman and Justin Tocket engineering</li>
<li>Dave Glasser Mastering (Grammy winning Grateful Dead mastering engineer)</li>
<li>Jim Mimna doing an amazing job on Videos.</li>
<li>This campaign is very important to me because for the first time in my solo album career we are going to pull out all of the stops for radio, press and moving multi genre (BLUES, JAM BAND, ROCK) Who says that 40 years into your career you can't have more success than you've ever had.</li>
<li><strong>Because of the caliber of musicians on this incredible album, we'd like to make sure that we can book a number of shows and festivals and be able to keep this amazing ensemble out on the road. Traveling with guys like this is not cheap;;;:)</strong></li>
<li>I believe the songs on LEMONADE are my best writing to date, and I was honored to have the assistance of an incredible star to be, Meredith Reed on the first two singles. Another VERY song of great magnitude to me is the song ""A THURSDAY IN JUNE"". It is a song about a subject that I feel is incredibly important.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>What we'll get is the ability to make this the biggest CD that the Bobby Messano team has ever put out. As you see below, to be able to follow my dream through on LEMONADE, it will take some blood, sweat, tears and money.</li>
<li>The CD has already cost a lot, most of which has come out of my pockets and a few investors. The specifics on the Indiegogo funding are as follows:</li>
<li>PR:$6000</li>
<li>Radio Promotion: $4000</li>
<li>Tour support for the band to tour as a unit: $15,000</li>
<li><strong>PERKS</strong></li>
<li>We're offering a number of cool perks, including a guitar or two, product, concert offers, VIP packages at shows and the like....Please take a look....Perks will be updated.</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<li>Those of you who know my music, know I never give up....I put a record out every two years, but I feel this one can literally have World Wide impact, especially after seeing the reaction to my European Tour last Fall</li>
<li>On the success side, LEMONADE is my 9th solo album. My last 6 have garnered 31 Grammy First Round Ballots, a Billboard #1, weeks on the Billboard Top 10 Chart, a BB King's Sirius/XM #1 Debut with 8 months in the Top 10, a 2017 HMMA award for Best Blues Album, A Blues Blast Nomination in 2015 and my induction into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2012. </li>
