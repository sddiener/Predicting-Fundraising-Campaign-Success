<p><i>In 1905, two American naturalists set out on horseback across the remote deserts of Baja California, Mexico. Their 2,000-mile expedition was the first of its kind to span the entire peninsula and complete a comprehensive survey of Baja's flora and fauna. Zig-zagging from coast to coast across the desolate interior, Edward William Nelson and Edward Alphonso Goldman described plants and animals unknown to science. </i></p>
<p><i>One hundred years later, Goldman's descendants return to Baja to retrace the steps of this landmark expedition on motorcycles, and document the changing nature of this strange and beautiful landscape.</i></p>

<p><br/><strong><i>The Devil's Road</i></strong> is very multifaceted. It is part historical documentary, a re-telling of Baja's natural history, highlighting the significant work both Nelson and Goldman did in this region, in a time when very little was known about Baja. We will be documenting 110-plus years of change on the peninsula, looking at its environmental, economic, and cultural implications. The film is also part journey through several crew members' family history, as three of the frontrunners of the film are directly related to Edward A. Goldman. </p>
<p>At its core, <strong><i>The Devil's Road </i></strong>is an adventure film and travel narrative that aims to entertain viewers, while also being educational, raising awareness about, and paying homage to a uniquely beautiful and inspiring place that is quickly becoming tarnished by the human footprint. <br/> </p>

<p><br/>The crew completed a two-week preliminary expedition in May of 2016 as a proof-of-concept for our main expedition in March of 2017. Our producer, director, and scientific director explored and documented five islands (off both the Sea of Cortez and Pacific coasts) that Nelson and Goldman visited in 1905 and 1906. The team was able to complete this preliminary expedition on a micro budget and a limited timeframe. The result was a series of the five ""episodes"" below.</p>
<p>We were all fascinated by the changes that have occurred over the last century, and this has further motivated the crew to embark on the main expedition. But we can't do it without your help.</p>

<p>The crew spent many hours at the Smithsonian Institution sifting through and scanning most of the photographs, documents, and other treasures found in the archives that belonged to Nelson and Goldman. This is an important historical aspect of the film, as Nelson and Goldman had ties to president Theodore Roosevelt, John Muir, and other historical and scientific figures.</p>

<strike>Why I Made <i>Breaking Legs</i>? Get The Real Story! </strike><p></p>
<p><span><strike>Ok, so <i>Breaking Legs</i> has been a long time coming. A LONG time... When I was 6 years old, I enrolled in dance classes at my own insistence because I knew I wanted to be in the movies. My father was a big film buff, and I was inspired by the stylings of Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire and Donald O’Connor; by great movies like Gone With The Wind and Kings Row, Rebecca and Peyton Place. In 2nd grade I got my first leading role in the epic Twain Harte Elementary play, “Soup for the King”, and I was off and running. Within four years I was dancing on scholarship in Los Angeles and Marin County, and eventually trained at the San Francisco Ballet school year round. Throughout all this time, my poor mom had to shuttle me from place to place, say goodbye for months at a time and inevitably move to San Francisco with me. The sacrifices she made motivated me to push even further, and, after several professional stage productions, I went on to study at the USC film school. All that time I was following my passion for acting and dancing, and then, directing, but I never really fit in during school. Being a boy in a girl’s world, was not acceptable at the time. Hence, I wanted to make a modern day story about a girl's struggle to fit in. This is what inspired me to make Breaking Legs, a coming of age story of triumph &amp; perseverance with the social message of you can do anything if you put your mind to it! It's a great mix of struggle and comedy, because no matter how bad it gets, you can always still laugh. No one can take that away from you!</strike></span></p>

<p>With his mustache, receding hairline and somewhat portly frame, Richard Riehle (PRINCIPAL BATER) has often been cast as corrupt characters whose bravado melts in the face of adversity, He spent over 15 years working in repertory theaters in Oregon, Alaska, Arizona and elsewhere, in addition to teaching acting in Northern California and at the University of Washington. Riehle ventured to Broadway in 1985 and beginning a career as a working character player. After debuting in ""Execution of Justice"", a play based on the murder of Harvey Milk, he remained in New York and often worked with the Classic Stage Company and the Public Theatre. Roles in the movies ""Black Rain"" and ""Glory"" (both 1989) and the miniseries ""Cross of Fire"" (NBC, 1989) convinced him to move to Los Angeles. It was his part in ""Glory"" that actually put Riehle on the potential casting lists in Hollywood; he was featured only in one scene as a quartermaster sneeringly denying the ""Negro"" soldiers shoes while bathing in his own corruption. Riehle went on to give a memorable portrayal of the Reverend Scroggins who twists the truth on the witness stand in Jon Avnet's ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" (1991). In 1993, he was the older guard who survives the train crash with Richard Kimball in ""The Fugitive"" and also appeared as a member of the panel in ""Jury Duty"" and in a small role in ""Casino"" (both 1995). It wasn't until Mike Judge's, cult classic, ""Office Space"" (1999) hit VHS that people really started to recognize Richard and even so far as quoting lines from the movie. </p>

<h3>The Impact - From Rags to Riches - We All Win!</h3>
<p>Coming of Age Stories are those which really leave you feeling fluffy inside. Often done with passion and very little money, they generally aren't the big blockbusters of the summer. However, the blockbuster is the story itself. A prime example is the film called, ""Once."" This little Independent movie became a success, garnering over $9Million at the box-office, even though it was made for an Ultra Low Budget, like ours. This goes to show you that if you really tell a good story others' hearts will watch and follow.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges - The Audience &amp; The Fans - You!</h3> <p> Raising funds is not easy. However, having filmed most of the movie already, we are steps ahead of the rest. We have created these entertaining videos (which you have all seen by this time), a great trailer, and have tagged our product placement sponsors; reaching their market as well. The more we all get involved the more this film will get seen. It's all about social awareness. At the end of the day, it's the audience that benefit from donating or spreading the word about ""Breaking Legs,"" the little film that could. This way we can keep making family friendly films and entertaining all audiences.</p>

Why I Made Breaking Legs? Get The Real Story! 
Ok, so Breaking Legs has been a long time coming. A LONG time... When I was 6 years old, I enrolled in dance classes at my own insistence because I knew I wanted to be in the movies. My father was a big film buff, and I was inspired by the stylings of Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire and Donald O’Connor; by great movies like Gone With The Wind and Kings Row, Rebecca and Peyton Place. In 2nd grade I got my first leading role in the epic Twain Harte Elementary play, “Soup for the King”, and I was off and running. Within four years I was dancing on scholarship in Los Angeles and Marin County, and eventually trained at the San Francisco Ballet school year round. Throughout all this time, my poor mom had to shuttle me from place to place, say goodbye for months at a time and inevitably move to San Francisco with me. The sacrifices she made motivated me to push even further, and, after several professional stage productions, I went on to study at the USC film school. All that time I was following my passion for acting and dancing, and then, directing, but I never really fit in during school. Being a boy in a girl’s world, was not acceptable at the time. Hence, I wanted to make a modern day story about a girl's struggle to fit in. This is what inspired me to make Breaking Legs, a coming of age story of triumph & perseverance with the social message of you can do anything if you put your mind to it! It's a great mix of struggle and comedy, because no matter how bad it gets, you can always still laugh. No one can take that away from you!

But there still wasn’t money… But knowing that delaying production would probably end in defeat, I created the money out of thin air. In other words, I bled my 401K, and put together two other sources to make enough money to get us all the way through production. And thank God, it worked; well, almost.

With his mustache, receding hairline and somewhat portly frame, Richard Riehle (PRINCIPAL BATER) has often been cast as corrupt characters whose bravado melts in the face of adversity, He spent over 15 years working in repertory theaters in Oregon, Alaska, Arizona and elsewhere, in addition to teaching acting in Northern California and at the University of Washington. Riehle ventured to Broadway in 1985 and beginning a career as a working character player. After debuting in ""Execution of Justice"", a play based on the murder of Harvey Milk, he remained in New York and often worked with the Classic Stage Company and the Public Theatre. Roles in the movies ""Black Rain"" and ""Glory"" (both 1989) and the miniseries ""Cross of Fire"" (NBC, 1989) convinced him to move to Los Angeles. It was his part in ""Glory"" that actually put Riehle on the potential casting lists in Hollywood; he was featured only in one scene as a quartermaster sneeringly denying the ""Negro"" soldiers shoes while bathing in his own corruption. Riehle went on to give a memorable portrayal of the Reverend Scroggins who twists the truth on the witness stand in Jon Avnet's ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" (1991). In 1993, he was the older guard who survives the train crash with Richard Kimball in ""The Fugitive"" and also appeared as a member of the panel in ""Jury Duty"" and in a small role in ""Casino"" (both 1995). It wasn't until Mike Judge's, cult classic, ""Office Space"" (1999) hit VHS that people really started to recognize Richard and even so far as quoting lines from the movie. 


The Impact - From Rags to Riches - We All Win!
Coming of Age Stories are those which really leave you feeling fluffy inside. Often done with passion and very little money, they generally aren't the big blockbusters of the summer. However, the blockbuster is the story itself. A prime example is the film called, ""Once."" This little Independent movie became a success, garnering over $9Million at the box-office, even though it was made for an Ultra Low Budget, like ours. This goes to show you that if you really tell a good story others' hearts will watch and follow.   Risks & Challenges - The Audience & The Fans - You!  Raising funds is not easy. However, having filmed most of the movie already, we are steps ahead of the rest. We have created these entertaining videos (which you have all seen by this time), a great trailer, and have tagged our product placement sponsors; reaching their market as well. The more we all get involved the more this film will get seen. It's all about social awareness. At the end of the day, it's the audience that benefit from donating or spreading the word about ""Breaking Legs,"" the little film that could. This way we can keep making family friendly films and entertaining all audiences.

<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">An Important story that hasn't been told...</span></h3>
<p>As a veteran Chicago-based journalist, campaign consultant and filmmaker, I am not often surprised at what goes on at the higher levels of government.  For the last 12 years, I have been researching and writing about wrongful justice cases that occur all to often.  But, when I learned the full story of respected Chicago Teamster leader Bill Hogan's ordeal and the abuses that have occured since the federal government took over the Teamsters union 25 years ago, I realized that a documentary film was needed to explain to the public how and why our constitutional rights can be put in jeopardy.  We've put together a talented crew and we are making progress, but we need your help to finish our shooting schedule. We invite you to become a part of our effort by making a donation of any size and by spreading the word about this project.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">  </span></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">When Bill Hogan spoke out against the government takeover of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, he became the target of an ugly vendetta by the IRB under the Department of Justice.   The film shows how Hogan was expelled on transparently trumped up charges.  Thereafter, the government subpoenaed his phone records and expelled four of his friends-- all elected Teamster officials -- <i>simply for talking to Bill</i>.  The government then charged Hogan with Contempt of Court for speaking to his lifelong friends, a charge which carried a possible six month sentence. <br/></span></p>
<p>Shocked by the actions of the federal government, a group of prominent citizens including elected officials, business and labor leaders, members of the film industry and civil libertarians joined the Free Speech for Bill Hogan Committee to protest this unjust legal harassment.  After an expensive legal battle, the Justice Dept. agreed to drop the charges in 2011, but Bill Hogan still is prohibited from speaking to his friends in the Teamster Union and 1.4 million Teamster members continue to be denied due process and the right to practice free speech.

Thanks you for helping us toward our goal!

The Indiegogo.com total shows $1532 in contributions, but since beginning this campaign we actually raised a total of $22,000 toward our $25k goal counting several larger tax deductible contributions donated through our fiscal sponsor Chicago Filmmakers that are not counted in the Indiegogo total.  The financial support we've received helps us produce a film that will clearly show how basic rights can be abused by the very institutions we count on to protect them and the price that is paid by those who challenge the system.  We will be crisscrossing the country to complete our shooting schedule and will update our supporters along the way!



An Important story that hasn't been told...
As a veteran Chicago-based journalist, campaign consultant and filmmaker, I am not often surprised at what goes on at the higher levels of government.  For the last 12 years, I have been researching and writing about wrongful justice cases that occur all to often.  But, when I learned the full story of respected Chicago Teamster leader Bill Hogan's ordeal and the abuses that have occured since the federal government took over the Teamsters union 25 years ago, I realized that a documentary film was needed to explain to the public how and why our constitutional rights can be put in jeopardy.  We've put together a talented crew and we are making progress, but we need your help to finish our shooting schedule. We invite you to become a part of our effort by making a donation of any size and by spreading the word about this project.  

                                       

Veteran actor Jim Belushi (pictured at right with Hogan) has agreed to narrate the film because he is directly  familiar with events the film will cover,  ""I urge everyone who cares about injustice and defending our basic rights to support this film,"" says Belushi, who worked on four film productions with Bill Hogan (above left) in Chicago. (Hogan with actor Tom Hanks below)
                             
Bill Hogan helped bring the film industry to Chicago by negotiating flexible work agreements with Hollywood studios and productions.  ""Without Bill Hogan there wouldn't be a Chicago film industry,"" says Lucy Salenger, former head of the Illinois Film Office.  Unfortunately, Hogan paid a steep price for his principled stand when he criticized continued government control of the Teamsters.
""A Battle for Free Speech"" is a story about the betrayal of basic constitutional rights -- free speech and due process -- for 1.4 million Teamster members by the Department of Justice, which is supposed to protect our freedoms.  In a highly controversial move, initiated by then US Attorney Rudy Giuliani (pictured below), the government took control of the Teamsters union more than 25 years ago on a supposedly ""temporary"" basis to remove mobsters from a handful of locals out of 700 in the international union.

                                  


 Abuses Follow Misguided Federal Takeover of Union

The mob elements were removed within three years, but the all powerful Independent Review Board (IRB) under the Department of Justice continues to control the union 25 years later.  The film shows that to justify their continued control, the IRB has issued baseless and trivial charges to expel honest officials across the country who were never accused of a crime.

When Bill Hogan spoke out against the government takeover of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, he became the target of an ugly vendetta by the IRB under the Department of Justice.   The film shows how Hogan was expelled on transparently trumped up charges.  Thereafter, the government subpoenaed his phone records and expelled four of his friends-- all elected Teamster officials -- simply for talking to Bill.  The government then charged Hogan with Contempt of Court for speaking to his lifelong friends, a charge which carried a possible six month sentence. 
Shocked by the actions of the federal government, a group of prominent citizens including elected officials, business and labor leaders, members of the film industry and civil libertarians joined the Free Speech for Bill Hogan Committee to protest this unjust legal harassment.  After an expensive legal battle, the Justice Dept. agreed to drop the charges in 2011, but Bill Hogan still is prohibited from speaking to his friends in the Teamster Union and 1.4 million Teamster members continue to be denied due process and the right to practice free speech. This battle to defend our basic rights goes on.
How you can help us.
Please help us tell this important story to a national audience by making a contribution that helps us finish production by pressing the ""Contribute Now"" button at the top.  We welcome small contributions as well as large ones.  There are perks listed below for those who contribute and your support will assure that our experienced documentary crew will be able to produce a powerful story that hasn't been told. 
Equally important, you can help us by spreading the word about the film to educate a public that may not be aware that constitutionally guaranteed rights can't be taken for granted.   Our basic freedoms need to be defended by an informed public.  As the eminent Judge Learned Hand wrote: 

""Liberty lies in the hearts of men and women.  When it dies there, no constitution, no law, no court can even do much to help it.  While it lies there, it needs no constitution, no law, no court to save it."" 
Please use the Indiegogo.com share tools to spread the word about the film!
Why Your Help is Needed
 We need $30,000 to finish our 25 day shooting schedule which will include shooting in the Chicago area, Detroit, Cleveland, New York, Washington DC, Las Vegas and Minneapolis.  This will include the cost of our crew, transportation, equipment and the licensing of archival footage. Any contributions received beyond $30,000 will go to cover the cost of post-production.
If you need a Tax Deduction...
You can donate to our film production and receive a tax deduction by clicking the link to our fiscal sponsor Chicago Filmmakers and then hitting the donate button on the page.  Chicago Filmmakers is a non profit 501(c)3 tax exempt organization.

What Others Say About This Injustice

“the government has clearly
crossed over into a new frontier in law enforcement, injecting itself into the
operation of labor unions and, under the broad terms of the statute,
potentially any other commercial entity.”


  -- Former Senator Sam Nunn, Chair Senate Subcommittee on Permanent Investigations at a hearing of the subcommittee 

 
""Giuliani wants to let the government
take over the whole union through a civil action, where the burden of proof is
considerably less than in a criminal trial.


There is something
inherently unfair about that...we have criminal laws to deal with folks who do wrong.  People are guilty of something, you make your case, convict
them and put them away. Otherwise, lay off. In this nation of laws, the
presumption of innocence must prevail...This time the short cuts are aimed at the Teamsters. Other times they’re
used to grab the property of suspected drug dealers who haven’t been indicted,
much less convicted. Or to seize a company thought to be controlled by the mob.
That’s frontier justice at its crudest.""                                                                                                        --Chicago Tribune editorial. July 8,                                                                                                     1988

And About Bill Hogan

""Before a person’s rights are revoked in America, one must first be accused, tried, con­victed and sentenced in a court of law. Only the courts should have that power.Yet it can happen and it is hap­pening right now to an upstanding, good and decent local civic and la­bor leader, in whose case the pun­ishment is the crime...
Bill Hogan Jr., 60, has been banned for life from the Interna­tional Brotherhood of Teamsters by order of a nongovernmental en­tity known as the Independent Re­view Board. The board is unilater­ally empowered to ban Teamsters from their union, without so much as civil or criminal charges being filed against them...


When Hogan served as president of the Joint Council, he immediately re­duced his own compensation by $80,000 annually because Hogan’s life has been about fighting for jus­tice and fairness for workers, not about enriching himself.Why should any American be prohib­ited from associating with another American, especially with someone like Bill Hogan, who has never even been accused of a crime?""

Something I only ever heard about but knew very little about. But as the months went by and after so many tests, assessments and therapy sessions and watching as my son grew but he wasn't reaching his milestones. He would not respond to his name until he reached 5 years old, he still has no speech and only communicates through waving, taking me to objects he wants or shaking his head for 'No'. </p><p></p><p> At 2 years old Luca was officially diagnosed with 'High-Functioning Autism'. Which meant we could get him the one to one support he desperately needed at school and access Therapy sessions which had amazing results with his behavioural problems.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had his diagnosis it was still a constant battle with getting him the help and support he needed. For example when he started playgroup at 2 years old even though the teachers where aware that he had Autism and needed extra supervision they where not trained and could not cope. I would have calls and letters of complaint saying they do not tolerate bullying when in fact it was just my son doing what he loves to do playing roughly ( he likes to jump on people and get tickled). The teachers where put on a course to help them get the appropriate training to support my son and he was 'allowed' to continue to attend his playgroup sessions. When Luca started Nursery again there was issues with his behaviour. He would go in for 30 minutes a day for a week, then an hour the following week and so on until he reached the full 2 and half hours.

From the age of 10 months my son was being assessed for Autism. Something I only ever heard about but knew very little about. But as the months went by and after so many tests, assessments and therapy sessions and watching as my son grew but he wasn't reaching his milestones. He would not respond to his name until he reached 5 years old, he still has no speech and only communicates through waving, taking me to objects he wants or shaking his head for 'No'.  At 2 years old Luca was officially diagnosed with 'High-Functioning Autism'. Which meant we could get him the one to one support he desperately needed at school and access Therapy sessions which had amazing results with his behavioural problems.Even though he had his diagnosis it was still a constant battle with getting him the help and support he needed. For example when he started playgroup at 2 years old even though the teachers where aware that he had Autism and needed extra supervision they where not trained and could not cope. I would have calls and letters of complaint saying they do not tolerate bullying when in fact it was just my son doing what he loves to do playing roughly ( he likes to jump on people and get tickled). The teachers where put on a course to help them get the appropriate training to support my son and he was 'allowed' to continue to attend his playgroup sessions. When Luca started Nursery again there was issues with his behaviour. He would go in for 30 minutes a day for a week, then an hour the following week and so on until he reached the full 2 and half hours. After the first year Luca settled in nicely and would only occasionally have an outburst where his behaviour was extreme. When Luca was 5 years old he started at primary school which was mainstream but with a special base with 4 others children with special needs like Luca.

<br/>
<p>Ocean wildlife is impacted by many human activities and natural events.  Climate change, pollution,  impacts on food supply and habitat, disturbance and harassment,  marine debris, ghost nets,  related entanglement, and similar issues face many species, from  manta rays to  whales, dolphins, and pinnipeds.  Injured, ill, or entangled marine mammals are sometimes rescued by authorized agencies to have a second chance at life.<br/>
</p>
<p>Species such as seals and sea lions typically live in coastal areas,  are high on a food chain, and can serve as ""indicators"" or ""sentinels"" of ocean health and conditions.<br/></p>
<p>This documentary will uniquely cover and address many issues about marine mammals and ocean habitats.  <b>Education is key to making informed choices.</b><br/></p>
<p>This production will also focus on the behavior and biology of pinnipeds in the wild, showing beautiful, rare,  and compelling footage of these animals engaged in natural behaviors in the wild environment including rare footage of Hawaiian Monk Seals. <b>Providing this vivid imagery will help to inspire and inform, as we see these animals swim and dive in the underwater world, and also, bond with their pups on a natural beach.</b>  <br/></p>

<br/><br/> Seals and sea lions are pinnipeds, marine mammals that live both in the water and also on land.  They live in two worlds.  Like other ocean wildlife, they are impacted by the  many critical issues facing the ocean and coastal environment.<br/>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Mothers and pups need to bond without disturbance <br/></p>
<br/>During the spring of 2015, an acute stranding  crisis for sea lion pups took place on the Pacific Coast of the United States, overwhelming rescuers and rehabilitation facilities. A similar event occurred in 2013.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1238746/files/20150221155331-IMG_1526.JPG?1424562811"" src="""" style=""width: 260.105px; height: 146px;""/></p>
<p><br/></p>Pinnipeds are ""indicator"" species, reflecting issues about conditions in the ocean and coastal environment.  They are ""sentinels"" of the sea.<br/><br/>
<p>Pollution, marine debris, discarded gear and equipment, boat strikes, ocean noise, and disturbance all affect ocean habitats and wildlife. As increased human interactions affect ocean areas, related impacts on wildlife also increase.<br/></p>
<p>Raising awareness is key to helping marine wildlife and habitat protection.<br/></p>
<br/>
<p>With education and awareness, we can make the best informed decisions about our own actions as they affect the ocean and coastal environment.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary 


Documentaries raise awareness, inform, and inspire.


This documentary is being produced by a past acting Executive Director of La Jolla Friends of the Seals, a non profit organization.
This project and fundraiser is supported by the Sierra Club in the Sierra Club Magazine and by Sealwatch.org, a prestigious non profit organization that covers pinniped issues around the world (see links below).
Exclusive interviews with marine mammal experts are featured.
Coverage of discarded net retrieval, and marine mammal rescue  are both included in the production. 
MEDIA FROM WORLD CLASS  PROVIDERS IS BEING UTILIZED IN THE PRODUCTION.
My name is Ellen Stanton. 
I am a film festival winner, a past acting Executive Director of La Jolla Friends of the Seals, a non profit organization, and I have a significant background in marine mammal issues.

I need your help to finish this critically important documentary about ocean wildlife and the serious challenges to the marine environment and its inhabitants.  Seals and sea lions will be featured in this production along with manta rays, sharks, orcas, and more.  I have worked in the area of marine mammal issues for many years.  It is important to bring this material about ocean wildlife to public awareness  as the ocean environment is increasingly impacted by human activity, and wildlife is subjected to many threats and challenges, which range from harmful to deadly.  Wildlife is  very fascinating to study, to learn about the many unique abilities of marine animals.
   
This project will be including topical and current material about research, and environmental impacts, including the current UME""S, or Unusual Mortality Events, that have been declared for Guadalupe and Northern Fur Seals.









https://twitter.com/Sierra_Magazine/status/663867238739374080 I want to be able to bring this documentary to many audiences, to inform, raise awareness, and inspire.  I need your help to complete the production and make it available to many audiences.  Education and awareness are key to making informed choices.  The development of Marine Protected Areas is in some cases part of the solution.  But more attention is needed ...
Please help with your donations.  There is nothing more compelling and moving than watching and appreciating animals in the wild, engaged in natural behaviors. This production shows many natural scenes,  along with providing expert information. 
More Details
As an award winning filmmaker,  and former Executive Director of a marine wildlife organization,  I am producing this critically important documentary  about marine wildlife and ocean conservation challenges. I have also worked with community college students at Mesa College in San Diego,  been interviewed by the Humane Society of the United States' ""All Animals"" magazine, and have produced other documentaries.

Many human activities impact coastal areas and ocean wildlife and habitats. 
  









Ocean wildlife is impacted by many human activities and natural events.  Climate change, pollution,  impacts on food supply and habitat, disturbance and harassment,  marine debris, ghost nets,  related entanglement, and similar issues face many species, from  manta rays to  whales, dolphins, and pinnipeds.  Injured, ill, or entangled marine mammals are sometimes rescued by authorized agencies to have a second chance at life.

Species such as seals and sea lions typically live in coastal areas,  are high on a food chain, and can serve as ""indicators"" or ""sentinels"" of ocean health and conditions.
This documentary will uniquely cover and address many issues about marine mammals and ocean habitats.  Education is key to making informed choices.
This production will also focus on the behavior and biology of pinnipeds in the wild, showing beautiful, rare,  and compelling footage of these animals engaged in natural behaviors in the wild environment including rare footage of Hawaiian Monk Seals. Providing this vivid imagery will help to inspire and inform, as we see these animals swim and dive in the underwater world, and also, bond with their pups on a natural beach.  







 Seals and sea lions are pinnipeds, marine mammals that live both in the water and also on land.  They live in two worlds.  Like other ocean wildlife, they are impacted by the  many critical issues facing the ocean and coastal environment.

Mothers and pups need to bond without disturbance 
During the spring of 2015, an acute stranding  crisis for sea lion pups took place on the Pacific Coast of the United States, overwhelming rescuers and rehabilitation facilities. A similar event occurred in 2013.
Pinnipeds are ""indicator"" species, reflecting issues about conditions in the ocean and coastal environment.  They are ""sentinels"" of the sea.
Pollution, marine debris, discarded gear and equipment, boat strikes, ocean noise, and disturbance all affect ocean habitats and wildlife. As increased human interactions affect ocean areas, related impacts on wildlife also increase.
Raising awareness is key to helping marine wildlife and habitat protection.

With education and awareness, we can make the best informed decisions about our own actions as they affect the ocean and coastal environment.






There is NO OTHER production that covers this range of material, with this kind of footage.  World class experts will be featured, along with the work of non profit groups engaged in ocean conservation and animal rescue activities.

This feature length documentary is geared to have a tremendous impact on public awareness,  like other recent ocean themed documentaries, 

The documentary will include expert interviews and presentations and  cover behavior, biology, habitats, ecological relationships, human impacts, and rescue and rehabilitation.  It includes  extensive footage as acquired by world class cinematographers. The project is near completion, and your help will do a great deal to bring it to the point of distribution, to film festivals, theaters, schools,  broadcast, DVD/Blu-ray, and VOD.  You can play an important part in helping to complete this exciting project.

Team: Throughout the production process, I have been utilizing expert information and resources and consultations on  scientific content and technical matters with experts currently engaged in work in the field.  I personally hold a master's degree in psychology, with additional academic work in animal behavior,  have  obtained a film festival award and produced a short ocean wildlife  documentary shown at events at the Cabrillo National Monument.My ""team"" includes many experts: marine biologists, expert videographers, and production specialists. I am  acquiring rare footage of seals and sea lions in natural settings, and also, utilizing media from world class providers including film festival winners, BBC providers,  and including  rare footage of monk seals,  and  of sharks depicting  symbiotic relationships. 

What We Need and What You Get: Perks!


The production has been significantly  funded, but needs additional funding for completion.  Approximately $22000 has been sent on the production to this point.  Donated and acquired expert media content and completed production tasks have moved the project forward.  Extensive footage has been obtained along with expert interviews.  The script has been completed. 

The remaining funding  needs are for final production and post production tasks, including professional voice over recording.  With funding for these items, the production can be moved toward completion.

<p>In the movie, Scott, an X-ray technician from
a rival hospital, gets sick and ends up in Garfield Community Hospital for his
treatment.  While there, he finds out that his ex-girlfriend Linda is
working there as a nurse.  He decides to try to win her back.  In
addition to this plot, the Hospital Administrator Dr. Logan Crank is informed
by his Board of Directors that Garfield is not showing enough profit, and will
be shut down unless this situation changes.  It's a race against time, as
both Scott and the hospital's staff have only a few days to reach their
respective goals.  In the meantime, the audience is treated to clever
jokes and some of the wackiest characters around.  The script features
slapstick humor as well as satire commentary about the state of healthcare in
our country.</p></span></span></div>

was the last you heard of it. Plus producing a movie is far more expensive than
making web content. So how do you know backing this project
will actually lead to a finished product?</p>
<p style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">1. We have always
made the most of our resources and have created some of the best quality content on the
Internet over the past 20 years. We are going to do this on a bigger scale.</p>
<p style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">2. We have the
infrastructure to produce the content.  The funds we are raising will be used for
production quality. That means most of the dollars will end up
on the screen, which is exactly where you want them.</p>
<p style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">3. Myriad is uniquely qualified to move from web content to narrative filmmaking. Over the
course of the last decade we have nurtured some of the biggest productions on the internet
with over 100 commercial films.  We want you to be an important part of this next exciting step!</p>

slapstick humor as well as satire commentary about the state of healthcare in
our country.







What We Need & What You Get

We've shot the trailer, now we need the rest of the film...and health insurance if you've got it:





• We know. You've backed a crowd-funded project before and that
was the last you heard of it. Plus producing a movie is far more expensive than
making web content. So how do you know backing this project
will actually lead to a finished product?
1. We have always
made the most of our resources and have created some of the best quality content on the
Internet over the past 20 years. We are going to do this on a bigger scale.
2. We have the
infrastructure to produce the content.  The funds we are raising will be used for
production quality. That means most of the dollars will end up
on the screen, which is exactly where you want them.
3. Myriad is uniquely qualified to move from web content to narrative filmmaking. Over the
course of the last decade we have nurtured some of the biggest productions on the internet
with over 100 commercial films.  We want you to be an important part of this next exciting step!



Once the campaign starts, we will begin behind
the scenes perks right away. Here's a list of planned events during the
campaign:
Monday February 9,  2015--
First Supporter update goes out.
Friday March 23,
2015-- Conference call for all early
supporters in which we will cover pre-production including concept art and more
detailed plot description. 
Wednesday April
15, 2015-- Special live stream from Myriad Production to show
clips of the film. 
Monday May 11, 2015--
Special HD download will be available of the film from the campaign. 
And we will have new events and stretch goals announced as the
campaign progresses.



We have tons of ""Great Perks"" for you as ""Our Supporters"".
Most of these items and experiences have never been offered before. For all the
details, check the column on the right.  
We have something less than the cost of a ""HOSPITAL ASPIRIN"" to ""The ULTIMATE PRESCRIPTION""  for a unique good time with a collection of prime-time perks with the media/PR attention for you and the film.

bring when he won his first Student Film Award at the Pittsburgh Art Institute for a short claymation film entitledThe Dance of the Clay People.  He continued to pursue and explore his interest
in film and won other awards at the Telly Awards in the 1990s and with

as an artist, writer, caricaturist, and graphic designer to the Art Direction of “Patiently
Yours"".  Prior to teaching Graphic Design, Communications, and PR at

Tech.

Your contributions will help to fund the rest of the production costs that go into filming a short-length film. This goes into location procurement, equipment maintenance, set materials & supplies, performers, post-production and marketing.  Here is more of the breakdown to see:

<h4>Was he a secret agent or a jilted lover?  Was he poisoned or did he die accidentally? Why were the tags removed from his clothes? </h4>
<h4>We aim to answer these and many other questions
              surrounding the mystery of the Somerton Man ⎯ a man found
              dead on Somerton Beach in 1948 who to this day has not
              been identified.</h4>
<br/>
<h3>The Tamám Shud Mystery</h3>
<p>An unidentified man was found dead on Somerton Beach, Adelaide, Australia, on 1st December 1948. He was physically fit, wearing a smart suit and tie. He had no ID and the labels were removed from his clothes. There were no signs of violence, and to this day we don't know who he is or how he died.  Intriguingly, a slip of paper was found in one of his pockets with the printed words ""Tamám Shud,""  meaning ""ended"" or ""finished"" in Persian. It was from the book of poetry <i>The</i> <i><i>Rubáiyát</i> of Omar Khayyam</i>.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the poetry book was found and recovered 6 months later. Strangely, a sequence of apparently meaningless letters were found on the back cover. Was this some kind of code?  Do the letters hold the key?<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>There are many inconclusive theories on the identity of this man.  Was he poisoned?  Was he a secret agent?  Was he rebuffed from a romantic relationship? Were the strange letters a secret code?</p>
<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Adelaide"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">University of Adelaide</a> has assisted in this case since the outset in 1949. The present university team is committed to solving the mystery of the man's identity.</p>

<h3>Why We Need Your Support     <br/>
</h3>This is an unparalleled mystery that has not been solved for over 60 years. A solution will provide closure to possibly related families, as well as broader impact to the community.  A number of intensive searches of historical records are needed, and collating the information requires extra manpower. There are also legal costs associated with Freedom of Information (FOI) applications. Moreover, samples of the man's hair have been preserved in a museum, and we are performing ongoing work to analyze the isotopes in the hair to find clues as to the man's movements in the last month of his life.<br/><br/><p>We have also determined that the hair stains positive for DNA, and have found that his maternal DNA <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_H_%28mtDNA%29"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">haplotype is H</a>.  However, the DNA concentration levels in the hair are rather low for finding living relatives on genealogical DNA databases. These databases are a tantalizing key to solving the mystery, as we can test for familial matches with over a million currently living people.<br/></p>
<p>We will produce a set of informational videos to raise awareness for the
 need of an exhumation to obtain DNA from the man's teeth, at the nuclear DNA concentration level required for use on genealogical databases. An exhumation will enable us to perform tooth and bone isotope tests to find 
location information, and also find where he was born. In the meantime, we 
will fine tune the cutting-edge forensic DNA extraction and sequencing 
techniques on the hair samples we have ⎯ in preparation ⎯ should an exhumation be granted.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>How Donations Will Be Utilized </h3>
<p>This campaign is<b> Phase 1, </b> where (i) historical searches, (ii) freedom of information (FOI) applications, (iii) ongoing forensic tests, and (iv) video production raising the awareness for the need of an exhumation all require your generous support, as these accrue significant costs. This campaign will fund this phase.  <b>Phase 2:</b> Should an exhumation finally be granted, a future campaign will be initiated to cover that phase, if further support is needed. <br/></p>

</div></div>","Was he a secret agent or a jilted lover?  Was he poisoned or did he die accidentally? Why were the tags removed from his clothes? 
We aim to answer these and many other questions
              surrounding the mystery of the Somerton Man ⎯ a man found
              dead on Somerton Beach in 1948 who to this day has not
              been identified.

The Tamám Shud Mystery
An unidentified man was found dead on Somerton Beach, Adelaide, Australia, on 1st December 1948. He was physically fit, wearing a smart suit and tie. He had no ID and the labels were removed from his clothes. There were no signs of violence, and to this day we don't know who he is or how he died.  Intriguingly, a slip of paper was found in one of his pockets with the printed words ""Tamám Shud,""  meaning ""ended"" or ""finished"" in Persian. It was from the book of poetry The Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyam.
Remarkably, the poetry book was found and recovered 6 months later. Strangely, a sequence of apparently meaningless letters were found on the back cover. Was this some kind of code?  Do the letters hold the key?

There are many inconclusive theories on the identity of this man.  Was he poisoned?  Was he a secret agent?  Was he rebuffed from a romantic relationship? Were the strange letters a secret code?
The University of Adelaide has assisted in this case since the outset in 1949. The present university team is committed to solving the mystery of the man's identity.

A Possible Connection to the USA?There are a number of compelling factors about this case that indicate the Somerton Man is possibly an American.  Read the latest findings here. Your support will enable the necessary tests to confirm or eliminate this hypothesis.
Please click on the Gallery tab at the top of this page to view some of the latest forensic results.





Why We Need Your Support     
This is an unparalleled mystery that has not been solved for over 60 years. A solution will provide closure to possibly related families, as well as broader impact to the community.  A number of intensive searches of historical records are needed, and collating the information requires extra manpower. There are also legal costs associated with Freedom of Information (FOI) applications. Moreover, samples of the man's hair have been preserved in a museum, and we are performing ongoing work to analyze the isotopes in the hair to find clues as to the man's movements in the last month of his life.We have also determined that the hair stains positive for DNA, and have found that his maternal DNA haplotype is H.  However, the DNA concentration levels in the hair are rather low for finding living relatives on genealogical DNA databases. These databases are a tantalizing key to solving the mystery, as we can test for familial matches with over a million currently living people.
We will produce a set of informational videos to raise awareness for the
 need of an exhumation to obtain DNA from the man's teeth, at the nuclear DNA concentration level required for use on genealogical databases. An exhumation will enable us to perform tooth and bone isotope tests to find 
location information, and also find where he was born. In the meantime, we 
will fine tune the cutting-edge forensic DNA extraction and sequencing 
techniques on the hair samples we have ⎯ in preparation ⎯ should an exhumation be granted.

How Donations Will Be Utilized 
This campaign is Phase 1,  where (i) historical searches, (ii) freedom of information (FOI) applications, (iii) ongoing forensic tests, and (iv) video production raising the awareness for the need of an exhumation all require your generous support, as these accrue significant costs. This campaign will fund this phase.  Phase 2: Should an exhumation finally be granted, a future campaign will be initiated to cover that phase, if further support is needed. 


    Societal Impact
By working on a case as tough as this, the improvement in historical search methods and forensic genealogy will provide wider impact. The benefits to society in efficient identification techniques are:


Efficient closure of cold cases and combating crime.

Solving the identity of many unmarked war graves.
Finding the identity of those following a natural disaster.
Closure for those with lost relatives.
Assistance to disconnected families.



Risks & ChallengesThe DNA extraction from old hair is extremely challenging, in this specific case, where we need a large amount of nuclear DNA in order to find familial connections on genealogical databases. Fortunately, The University of Adelaide houses the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA (ACAD) with world-class expertise in developing cutting-edge forensic DNA techniques.

 Other Ways You Can Help
If you are unable to support this funding campaign, your support is still valuable in other ways. Please help promote this campaign on your personal social media, such as Twitter and Facebook.If anyone in your family grew both their canine teeth next to their two 
central teeth, and if you have an unresolved male connection in your 
family tree, anytime between 1900 and the 1940s, then please contact Derek Abbott as you may possibly be part of the solution.
Petition
Moreover, please consider supporting the petition to exhume the Somerton Man.Your support makes you part of  history in solving this case.Assisting The Investigation 

If you are able help the case by performing some historical, genealogical, ship passenger log, or missing persons searches yourself ⎯ or via help in answering some of the open questions surrounding this case, we encourage crowdsourced investigation.  To engage in finding some suitable open questions, try Reddit in the first instance.  Avoid websites with untrusted sources, to avoid disinformation, as there is plenty out there on the internet.

— HELP US SHOOT OUR ""TEASER"" TO SELL THE IDEA FOR A ""SHORT"" —
The #HiddenBloodlines franchise is a delightful jaunt through the mind of Great White North writer: ReGi McClain. 
Faerie Blood
the first of the series, will plunge you into a world filled with fear and hope, wonder and despair, as reality mingles with mythology to bring the story to life. It's slated for release in 2015- this
project is for it's screenplay.                                                    

                                                                





""Harsha Mooreland and her brother are dying of a mysterious disease 
that has already killed their mother and sister.
When Harsha learns their illness may not be of human origin, 

she sets out on a quest to find a cure among creatures 
she thought only existed in faerie tales.""




ReGi McClain is a wife, mother, easily-amused daydreamer, and prima raconteur for Wild Berry 
Publications. She writes fantasy novels, flash fiction in multiple 
genres, and children's books. Her stories are endearing, personal, fun, sometimes dark, and often snarky. Her influences include C.S. Lewis, Tolkein, Agatha Christie, Andrew Lang, and mythology from around the world. 

                                        WildBerry Publications- Facebook


You can see one of the first steps in her series production with a ""behind-the-scenes"" during the book cover shoot:
     

     The end game is to see this series in tv or motion
picture. 
    Taking the wheel on that is supporting actor Matthew ""M@tch"" Ray (Matchiam.com) spearheading this screenplay/ sizzle funding process with hopes to see #HiddenBloodline as a tv or motion picture franchise. 



Kelly Jo Keyser:  (KellyJoKeyser.com) as ""Harsha"",


Joshua Diolosa:  (JoshuaDiolosa.com) as ""Zeeb"", 
Alan Clayton:   (from the goth band Wol) as ""Jason""


Cat LaCohie:  (CatLaCohie.com) as ""Seraph""








 We hope this
production will garnish a following in demographics of Contemporary Fantasy,
Urban Fantasy, Young Adult, and New Adult fans across the world, as well as
securing itself in the growing world of CosPlayers.

<p>The film is to be directed by Cory Bowles (The Trailer Park Boys) and Executive Producer is Craig Cameron (""The Corridor"", ""The Disappeared"", ""Titanic""). <br/></p>
<p>This is a great, funny, unique coming of age love story. ""Full of off the wall funny brilliance"" according to one very experienced film industry professional. <br/></p>
<p>We have a large cast of mainly young people and have been work-shopping with 50+ young people since April 2014. We hope to start some stars of the future on their careers with this film! Set on the beautiful north shore of Nova Scotia, we'll be shooting in summer 2015. <br/></p>
<p>Our budget is a modest $250,000 and any money we can raise this way, will mean we can have the music soundtrack we want, and that we can spend more on marketing (we plan to screen at festivals around the world), and spend more in post-production to get a better 'polished' production.</p>
<p>If this film could become the ""Gregory's Girl"" for north shore Nova Scotia, we'll be happy!<br/></p>
<b>What we need</b><br/><br/>We have secured finance for the film - but any money we can raise through crowd-funding will allow us to make the film better - or to reduce some of the finance required from other sources. Every cent or penny we get will help us towards both of these goals. <br/><br/><b>What You Get</b>
</div><div> <p>Well, the most important thing you'll get is the warm, fuzzy feeling that you helped a really great little project get up to the next level. Or that you helped loads of young people have a truly great opportunity to have their talent recognized. <br/></p>
<p>Yes, we can give you perks, and we'll keep you informed of all sorts of unique items as a way of saying ""thank you"" and ""we love you"". Great little gifts such as bottles of award-winning Jost wine with a special ""The Only Game in Town"" label. Signed posters or advance DVDs. Invites to screenings.</p>
<p>More than that, we can offer the chance to be in the film - either as an extra, or even a named character with at least a line of dialogue. Great little gift idea for someone...anyone!</p>
<p>You know, the simplest way to look at this is that you are buying a DVD in advance - okay with a bit of a premium - but look how much good that simple act could do!<br/></p>
<p>Beyond that, we're the most friendly film-makers you've met. Once you're a friend you'll stay a friend and you feel like you're part of the family. <br/></p>
<p>It has been said that making a film is like going into war. We don't buy that. It's fun and we want to share that fun - this great journey - with you.<br/></p>
<b>The Impact</b>
</div><div> <p>This film tells a story of boy, different because of his Asperger's symptoms, that falls in love with a girl far out of his league. But it's about his friendship with the three boys and how they stand by each other. Yes, it's a comedy, but one that will stay with you for all sorts of reasons.</p>
<p>The film will launch the acting careers of some great young performers and promote the wonderful north shore of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>The team behind the production have years of experience in the film and TV world. Stuart Cresswell has written comedy plays for young people for 14 years. He was part of the team that launched a satellite TV channel in the UK. He has produced and directed some quality programs and documentaries, and short films such as ""Broken"".</p>
<p>Cory Bowles is part of the ""Trailer Park Boys"" team - and in recent months has begun to direct episodes of Canada's top TV series. His own short film ""Righteous"" received wide acclaim and was screened around the world at festivals.<br/></p> <ul></ul> </div> <div>
<b>Risks!</b><br/><br/> <p>Risks?? This is a feature film - there's no risk in producing feature films...well...we have a realistic and manageable budget, with full finance approved - all we're doing is trying to replace some of that finance with crowd-funding donations. Wouldn't it be great to have all of it raised through crowd-funding? <br/></p>
<p>But the production team have been down this road before. We're confident of festival screenings around the world and hope to secure distribution as we get closer to production.<br/> </p>
<b>Other Ways You Can Help</b>
</div><div> <p>Regardless of what you donate or take as a perk, please help us by spreading the word - let your facebook friends know, connect with us on twitter and all that, Or just drop us a line and ask if there's anything you can do to help.<br/></p>Remember to use the Indiegogo share tools!<ul> </ul> </div> <p>Thanks <br/></p><p>Stuart, Cory, Craig and the cast of young people from north Nova Scotia<br/></p></div>","Summary Writer/Producer Stuart Cresswell, known for producing quality documentaries and short films such as: ""The Bridge Rising"" (BBC, 2012); ""Painting the wilderness"" (2010) and ""Broken"", has come up with a wonderful comedy feature film (100 mins) about a teenage boy with Asperger's Syndrome who has an uncanny gift for never failing to get out of the game of solitaire.

What we needWe have secured finance for the film - but any money we can raise through crowd-funding will allow us to make the film better - or to reduce some of the finance required from other sources. Every cent or penny we get will help us towards both of these goals. What You Get
 Well, the most important thing you'll get is the warm, fuzzy feeling that you helped a really great little project get up to the next level. Or that you helped loads of young people have a truly great opportunity to have their talent recognized. 
Yes, we can give you perks, and we'll keep you informed of all sorts of unique items as a way of saying ""thank you"" and ""we love you"". Great little gifts such as bottles of award-winning Jost wine with a special ""The Only Game in Town"" label. Signed posters or advance DVDs. Invites to screenings.
More than that, we can offer the chance to be in the film - either as an extra, or even a named character with at least a line of dialogue. Great little gift idea for someone...anyone!
You know, the simplest way to look at this is that you are buying a DVD in advance - okay with a bit of a premium - but look how much good that simple act could do!
Beyond that, we're the most friendly film-makers you've met. Once you're a friend you'll stay a friend and you feel like you're part of the family. 
It has been said that making a film is like going into war. We don't buy that. It's fun and we want to share that fun - this great journey - with you.
The Impact
 This film tells a story of boy, different because of his Asperger's symptoms, that falls in love with a girl far out of his league. But it's about his friendship with the three boys and how they stand by each other. Yes, it's a comedy, but one that will stay with you for all sorts of reasons.
The film will launch the acting careers of some great young performers and promote the wonderful north shore of Nova Scotia.
The team behind the production have years of experience in the film and TV world. Stuart Cresswell has written comedy plays for young people for 14 years. He was part of the team that launched a satellite TV channel in the UK. He has produced and directed some quality programs and documentaries, and short films such as ""Broken"".
Cory Bowles is part of the ""Trailer Park Boys"" team - and in recent months has begun to direct episodes of Canada's top TV series. His own short film ""Righteous"" received wide acclaim and was screened around the world at festivals.   
Risks! Risks?? This is a feature film - there's no risk in producing feature films...well...we have a realistic and manageable budget, with full finance approved - all we're doing is trying to replace some of that finance with crowd-funding donations. Wouldn't it be great to have all of it raised through crowd-funding? 
But the production team have been down this road before. We're confident of festival screenings around the world and hope to secure distribution as we get closer to production. 
Other Ways You Can Help
 Regardless of what you donate or take as a perk, please help us by spreading the word - let your facebook friends know, connect with us on twitter and all that, Or just drop us a line and ask if there's anything you can do to help.Remember to use the Indiegogo share tools!

<p>The trip into Toogie’s subconscious is a vessel to discuss the portrayal of violence in cinema today. Her fantasies, as well as visions of her past, reflect her personal stance on the issue.</p>
<p>Cinema has the ability to penetrate our subconscious, change our perception, and blur the lines between dreams and reality.

<p>I do hope that this initiative to speak openly about violence and sexuality will be able to break the 'taboo' surrounding such topics, one that is never explored much in Singapore. This project also hopes to break out of the usual mould of films revolving around familial life and nostalgia that is a rather common trend, to inspire more artists and filmmakers to present bolder and more personal statements than what is commonly seen. </p>
<p>The film also functions as a form of therapy. It empowers myself within the realm of fantasy to voice out personal opinions regarding sex and violence, topics I was never able to articulate in the real world due to judgement and preconceived notions imposed on me by society. <br/></p>
<p>As this film is a rather ambitious project, it'll require a good amount of resources. That is why I need this campaign to ask for your help. </p>

</div></div>","I’m Clare Chong, a graduate of School Of The Arts Singapore (SOTA). I am currently taking a gap year in hopes of creating this film, “Toogie’s Trip to Bukuokuka”.  It is my post-graduation endeavour before I embark on the next phase of university.Prior to this film, i've made several other short films, some of which has garnered a bit of attention in the recent months, such has 'Stranger By Night' that has been screened at the 11th Singapore Short Cuts 2014,  nominated for Best Fiction, Best Director, Best Performance, Best Script for the 6th Singapore short film awards, screened with a post screening dialogue at Yale NUS Arts Festival 2015, and had a debut International screening in University of Cambridge’s “DOUBLE EXPOSURE: Film Screenings ft. Independent Shorts” as part of a double bill promoting SG short films.[Still from 'Stranger By Night']Why am I making this film?
Toogie's Trip To Bukuokuka was born out of my documentation of dreams. Most of my dreams consists of violent imagery due to my avid consumption of gore and horror since a young age, with films such as A Clockwork Orange by Stanley Kubrick, The Holy Mountain by Alejandro Jodorowsky, and Ichi The Killer by Takashi Miike. Aware of the effects these imageries had on myself, I compiled my opinions, dreams and fantasies revolving around the portrayal of violence into a film. 
The trip into Toogie’s subconscious is a vessel to discuss the portrayal of violence in cinema today. Her fantasies, as well as visions of her past, reflect her personal stance on the issue.
Cinema has the ability to penetrate our subconscious, change our perception, and blur the lines between dreams and reality. As such, spectators - represented by The Girl - behind the television screen fervently and mindlessly consume these portrayals of violence, up to the point where we no longer question the morality of such images. 


I do hope that this initiative to speak openly about violence and sexuality will be able to break the 'taboo' surrounding such topics, one that is never explored much in Singapore. This project also hopes to break out of the usual mould of films revolving around familial life and nostalgia that is a rather common trend, to inspire more artists and filmmakers to present bolder and more personal statements than what is commonly seen. 
The film also functions as a form of therapy. It empowers myself within the realm of fantasy to voice out personal opinions regarding sex and violence, topics I was never able to articulate in the real world due to judgement and preconceived notions imposed on me by society. 
As this film is a rather ambitious project, it'll require a good amount of resources. That is why I need this campaign to ask for your help.

What's the film about?

The film revolves around Toogie, a 17-year old school girl who is lost in a cemetery. Due to certain occurrences, a man in an orange suit appears in front of her and offers her a flower. She eats the flower, triggering a hallucination of sorts.
The man in an orange suit brings her on a journey into barren landscapes and shows visions of her past and deepest fantasies, metaphorically portrayed through the Bukuokuka Tribesmen who act as Toogie’s chess pieces in the film.

Why should I contribute? 
Yes, we know this is a rather bold request, and we were surprised at how much it requires to make a film too.
For the pre-production process, the sets and props we are making will be extremely intricate, with specially hand crafted wire body harnesses, hand sewn wardrobe, and various other materials.
Production itself will cost quite a bit as we need to factor in transport, crew and cast welfare, and location rental. In order to achieve the shots that we envision for the film, we'd require several rather heavy camera and light equipment that will be a little more expensive to rent.
Finally, post production itself includes hiring editors and musicians to score the film.
No doubt, it sounds rather indulgent. However, I have already compromised on various aspects, and compromising it any further will change the original vision of the film, making it subpar. What's the point in making a film then?

Here is a breakdown of how the funds raised from indiegogo will be used: 
1. Cast - 1,000 USD
2. Crew - 1,000 USD

4. Camera Equipment - 4,500 USD
5. Lighting and sound Equipment - 3,500 USD

friend, an Iraqi war veteran, who is a mother of an infant and was 9 months
pregnant at the time of this incident. She was a victim of domestic abuse and
left the home with her young son. An over reaching and over zealous CPS got
involved and told her they needed her whereabouts to do a health and safety
check on her son. She invited them to her parents home. They arrived with 3
sheriff's department deputies who announced they were taking the child. When
she questioned the CPS worker and asked to see the court order, she was deemed
noncompiant, and beaten, while restrained, in front of her child, and
thankfully in front of home security cameras. You can clearly hear her scream
""I'm  pregnant!"" right before one deputy repeatedly punches this
restrained  mother.<br/>
<br/>
She was taken to jail and her son was placed in foster care even though there
were family members willing to care for the child. She was charged with
assulting a police officer although she denies any assault took place. While in
jail she repeatedly asked to have her injuries examined and documented and was
fearful for her unborn child. The jail nurse said she didn't want to get
involved fearing for her own job. No prenatal care was offered either. She was
segregated because she was pregnant in an isolation cell where she slept on
bare concrete and blankets and the lights were left on 24 hours a day. She was
awakened every 15 minutes not because she made any threats of self harm but
because that was the procedure in the isolation cells. She remained there for 6
days and when released she immediately went to her OB/GYN. They were able to
take pictures of her injuries still present 8 days after the attack. They were
also able to verify that these injuries were not present before as they saw her
the day before the incident. They also documented that she lost weight while in
captivity, not a good thing for a pregnant woman. <br/>
<br/>
She gave birth to another son soon after being released and once again CPS
swooped in and confiscated the newborn at the hospital and placed him with a
family member with severely restricted visits destroying the bonding and
breastfeeding process.<br/>
<br/>
I am pro-police. They have a thankless, dangerous job. But there are bad apples
who have no business being police officers. There are also bad departments who
through their bad leadership set an environment where this behavior is taught
and encouraged. <br/>
<br/>
I have known Deanna Jo since we served in Iraq together.  It is not cliche
when I say we went through some sh** together there. There is a very short list
of people who I say I trust with my life blindly. She is one of them. <br/>
<br/>
Deanna was first victimized in a domestic incident then once again by CPS and
the sheriff's office. There needs to be questions asked and accountability of
this shocking incident.</p><br/></div>","My

Seriously, we’re over it. These messages are sent to girls everyday. It’s time to rewrite the script. We believe every girl has a story, and behind that story is a community waiting to be heard.
Since November 2014, we’ve trained 20 girls in Oakland by supplying the equipment, education and mentorship necessary to help them become digital journalists, telling stories through the lenses of their experiences, communities and values.


Our girls have created beautifully-woven narratives about their families and neighborhoods that are meaningful and powerful.They are the modern-day storytellers. They are healers in their communities. WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU’LL GETWe want to connect communities through the power of storytelling and create even greater opportunities for underserved girls to realize their fullest potential. By helping us reach our goal of $20,000, you will take part in the launch of our Girls Speak Oakland summer program to create awareness in the push for more inclusive media and to empower girls to become heroines of their own stories. This goal will cover the cost of training 100 girls -- including providing digital tools, resources for trainers, and stipends for the girls.
BEYOND MONEY— WE NEED YOUR HELP SPREADING THE WORDGlobal Girl Media is a grassroots movement driven by youth, parents and community leaders who believe that there are stories yet to be told. Our Oakland girls are the embodiment of everything Global Girl stands for, and we are determined to give them the best training possible. Whether you are able to donate to our campaign or not, you can still help make history.

<p>At Beth Zion Messianic Synagogue, we restore the foundations of faith in Messiah, which was and always will be a Jewish faith for the whole world! (<i>Rom. 11</i>)<i>  </i>G-d has blessed us abundantly over the past 22 years that we have come together to worship as one family and share the truth of Yeshua (Jesus) through Jewish eyes. Without a permanent building, we have been renting at restaurants, parks, and churches that have opened their doors to us. Year after year, we have seen G-d’s hand moving in our synagogue, raising us up as central New Jersey’s only Messianic Jewish Synagogue. In 2001, we were blessed with the opportunity to purchase a 7 acre lot in Jackson, New Jersey with a colonial house where we could host our luncheons and mid-week Bible studies. A few years later, we were even more blessed with the completion of a barn space on this property that we use for outdoor events and community outreach. With each addition to the property, we seek to serve His kingdom in bigger ways.</p>
<p>After much prayer and waiting on the Lord’s direction for us, we feel led to embark on this next chapter of our ministry and expand our colonial house with a full worship space! We will finally be able to meet together in our own place, and we won't have to pay rent any more!</p>
<p>We’ve paid off the property, we have all the permits and we are finally ready to break ground on our own building where we can meet and worship together. However, we can’t do it alone. With your prayer and partnership, we believe G-d will bring this to happen. He has placed a strong calling on our hearts to reach His people and all those who seek to know Him. We are confident that He who began a good work will carry it on to completion.

<div><p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;"">Marketing strategies:</span></p></div>
<div></div>Our advertising strategy will be on all social media sites available, red carpet events, billboard advertising, mobile advertising, word of mouth, and flyers. <div> <div>
<p>Once Marbles is made and in theaters around the world, it has the<b> potential to make over 100 million</b>. Countries such as Japan, Africa, Europe, thrive on nostalgia. Marketing will be substantial in those markets, and create a wave of marble mania.  Our target market is for the whole family, ages 8 - 65. A PG rating.  Marbles has no age limit.<br/></p>

<div>
<h3>The horrible thing I dislike about Hollywood is</h3> <p>the constant remakes, an overload on sequels, and blue style comedies.  No offense, but hollywood is running out of ideas, and it obviously shows. </p>
<h3><span style=""line-height: 30px;""><b>What Makes Marbles Different?</b></span></h3>
</div>
<div> <p></p>
</div>
<p>Marbles is a comedy that is unique and never been seen in theaters.  It's a curve changing comedy.   Marbles is going to have an advantage of a built-in audience from the old school generation that played marbles in their day, and played at the parks on the playground throughout their childhood.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438844423/thxyzo73im3u5c6l7uli.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Marbles is going to be a memorable comedy, <b>and bring races of all cultures all over the world together</b>, and produce something that allows everyone an opportunity, poor or rich, to be good at something other than basketball, football, or the sports of the norm that requires you to be the quickest, the tallest and strongest.  </p>
<p>Marbles doesn't require any of those traits to be great.  <b>Marbles will be an inspiration to poor countries, by introducing a game that is economical, easy to learn, and player friendly, and can be competitive on a high level.</b></p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h3>The Pros and Cons of getting Marbles Produced.</h3>
<p></p>We feel that we won't have a problem competing with other comedies, considering our comedy will be the one people will want to see out of curiosity, based on the built-in audience, and the title alone.  We're going to stand alone from the other cluster of comedies being made.</div>
<div>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438919778/i00ehs7mwt26kh2q0yno.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>A so-called risk, very minimal, I like to say...</h3>
<div>if Marbles flop, which it won't, either way, will go down as one of the most memorable comedies of all time. </div>
<div>
<br/><p>A slight setback is, as of yet, putting a face on our product to sell it quicker, and  make it more lucrative.  <b>The cast that we have is unbelievably talented and can</b> <b>easily pull this film off without a famous face to play a minor role available</b>.  The main lead roles are filled already. A face to add on our project is a bonus, not a dagger.   I'm all about bringing out new talent.  Hollywood could use some new faces of comedy.<br/></p>
<p><b>I don't believe in risks, I believe in Faith.  Every decision we make is suppose to happen and is going according to plan, as I see it. If something fails, keep trying, whether it's another avenue or the same. Just as long as you reach your destination. </b></p>
<p>If we don't reach our ultimate funding, Marbles is still going to get filmed. It's a movie destined to be made.</p>

<div><p>                <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438883919/sr9enmqb0huo4ny95mfz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<div>He's a writer/actor/director/producer.   Arthur started in the entertainment business as an actor at a young age in a feature film titled, ""The Drifting Classroom,"" where he played the role of Kenny. After several commercials and entertaining audiences throughout, he left Japan and settled in Kansas and started modeling and doing pageants, where he won Mr. Congeniality in the Mr. Mahogony Pageant and placed third.  Arthur decided to audition for American Academy of Dramatics Arts, an accredited acting school in Los Angeles, and got accepted. After finishing school, Arthur was chosen from hundreds to be the lead in two of the end-of-school-year plays, and received a standing ovation.  <b>Arthur, then, developed a knack for writing comedy, and used his acting skills to develop unique movies and characters, which led to over 40 short films and 3 screenplays written and ready to produce.</b>

</div></div>","the title alone, if you let it ponder enough, becomes catchy.  Marbles is unilke any other comedy you've ever seen. It's a comedy for the whole family.  It'll make you LOL. It'll make you fall out of your seat L'n OL. It'll make you cry. Marketing is going to be profitable all over the globe, especially in Japan and all of Asia and Africa.  The possibilities are going to be endless. Marble bags, marbles, entitled t'shirts, anime cartoons, video games, all have the potential to be a top seller. And we have a sponsor, Marble King, ready to get this film started. Their marble products has been in movies, such as, Goonies, Peter Pan, Disney features, and has a creditable history within the movie industry.Now... A little insight into the Marble world.Marbles is a world within a world, when a marble name can define a player and intimidate his opponent, and the dress code: Baggy jeans, entitled t'shirt, knee pads, and flashy colored bandannas,           with the exception of the blue and red ones, those are banned.Introducing the Top Dog Marbleist, the highest pinnacle of a marbleist, just a handful, who's character is bigger than life, similar to an A-list actor, equipped with their own Sidekick, same as a caddy.Marble tattooes under their eyes symbolizing how many marble tournaments they've won. Not to mention, the marble groupies,                                              and the paparazzi, they just come with the territory of being a Top Dog Marbleist. Introducing the New School Marbleists, they flock in the thousands, they're just an average marbleist, with the exception of a few that just can't get over the hump, desperate for stardom, seeking a savior to join forces with them to take down the Top Dog Marbleist, Marboclepto, undefeated, winner of 4 tournaments in a row, becomes an instant fugitive, on the attempted murder of Marboki, The Ambassador to Marbles.  Years later, upon Marboclepto's ressurection, found innocent due to an investigation, and the awakening of Marboki from a coma, the New School Marbleists have taken over, led by Marbeast, a prodigy, New Schooler, the new kid in town, crushing and tormenting everyone that gets in his path, causing some to have a mental breakdown, giving no mercy.Marboclepto, a bit rusty, wants to reclaim what was his, and challenges Marbeast to an epic battle,                 and ends up in oblivion,spinning out of control, due to the consequences of his actions from a long layoff, and uncovers a secret that is going to blow the marble world wide open upon his rise back to the top.                                      The inner instincts of a Top Dog Marbleist.  What fuels his fire.

Although our budget is more substantial, this is guaranteed to get our film started, and eventually made.Development money will cover the cost of administration and overheads until the film is officially in pre-production.


We've already done a huge part on our behalf for part of the developmental phase. We have the budget plan in place, pay listing for the actors, schedules, possible shoot dates, insurance, tax breaks.

We will keep you posted on where the monies will be spent on during all phases of the production. Everyone one of you can say, you were apart of Marbles when it becomes a huge hit. 

A huge part of our budget will be spent on over 75 Cast members, not including extras,  B-list Actors for small roles we have on our list, Producer, Director, Travel and Living, Production Staff, Set Dressing, Special Effects, Camera, Wardrobe, Catering, Extras, Locations, Hard Drives/ Media, Sound, Marketing, Construction, Editorial, Music, Post Production, Post Tape/ Film Lab, Insurance, General Expenses, Indiegogo campaign gets a small percentage, managing and shipping out the perks.


Once we get past the 1st phase, our next step will be a much easier path to make this movie a success.  A network backer with a high level of interest, red carpet events, and theater play will be in place.
A specific itemized budget plan.

Marketing strategies:
Our advertising strategy will be on all social media sites available, red carpet events, billboard advertising, mobile advertising, word of mouth, and flyers.  
Once Marbles is made and in theaters around the world, it has the potential to make over 100 million. Countries such as Japan, Africa, Europe, thrive on nostalgia. Marketing will be substantial in those markets, and create a wave of marble mania.  Our target market is for the whole family, ages 8 - 65. A PG rating.  Marbles has no age limit.


The horrible thing I dislike about Hollywood is the constant remakes, an overload on sequels, and blue style comedies.  No offense, but hollywood is running out of ideas, and it obviously shows. 
What Makes Marbles Different?

 

Marbles is a comedy that is unique and never been seen in theaters.  It's a curve changing comedy.   Marbles is going to have an advantage of a built-in audience from the old school generation that played marbles in their day, and played at the parks on the playground throughout their childhood.


Marbles is going to be a memorable comedy, and bring races of all cultures all over the world together, and produce something that allows everyone an opportunity, poor or rich, to be good at something other than basketball, football, or the sports of the norm that requires you to be the quickest, the tallest and strongest.  
Marbles doesn't require any of those traits to be great.  Marbles will be an inspiration to poor countries, by introducing a game that is economical, easy to learn, and player friendly, and can be competitive on a high level.




The Pros and Cons of getting Marbles Produced.
We feel that we won't have a problem competing with other comedies, considering our comedy will be the one people will want to see out of curiosity, based on the built-in audience, and the title alone.  We're going to stand alone from the other cluster of comedies being made.





A so-called risk, very minimal, I like to say...
if Marbles flop, which it won't, either way, will go down as one of the most memorable comedies of all time. 

A slight setback is, as of yet, putting a face on our product to sell it quicker, and  make it more lucrative.  The cast that we have is unbelievably talented and can easily pull this film off without a famous face to play a minor role available.  The main lead roles are filled already. A face to add on our project is a bonus, not a dagger.   I'm all about bringing out new talent.  Hollywood could use some new faces of comedy.
I don't believe in risks, I believe in Faith.  Every decision we make is suppose to happen and is going according to plan, as I see it. If something fails, keep trying, whether it's another avenue or the same. Just as long as you reach your destination. 
If we don't reach our ultimate funding, Marbles is still going to get filmed. It's a movie destined to be made.
A bit about myself and the crew

Arthur is the creator of Marbles.  
                
He's a writer/actor/director/producer.   Arthur started in the entertainment business as an actor at a young age in a feature film titled, ""The Drifting Classroom,"" where he played the role of Kenny. After several commercials and entertaining audiences throughout, he left Japan and settled in Kansas and started modeling and doing pageants, where he won Mr. Congeniality in the Mr. Mahogony Pageant and placed third.  Arthur decided to audition for American Academy of Dramatics Arts, an accredited acting school in Los Angeles, and got accepted. After finishing school, Arthur was chosen from hundreds to be the lead in two of the end-of-school-year plays, and received a standing ovation.  Arthur, then, developed a knack for writing comedy, and used his acting skills to develop unique movies and characters, which led to over 40 short films and 3 screenplays written and ready to produce.

</div><div><br/></div><div>Hi, I'm Jim Tushinski, director and producer of the feature documentary <span style=""font-style: italic;"">I Always Said Yes: The Many Lives of Wakefield Poole, </span>which tells the story of an overlooked gay liberation and independent filmmaking pioneer. Poole's life as dancer, choreographer, director, independent filmmaker, artist, pornographer, and chef intertwines with American and LGBT history in remarkable ways. <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>For the last two years, the documentary has screened at film festivals around the world -- from Israel to New Zealand -- playing to delighted and moved audiences.</p>
<p>But the number of people who can see <i>I Always Said Yes</i> at a film festival are just a small part of the potential international audience.</p>
<p>I want to take the next step and make the documentary available through major Video on Demand platforms such as ITunes, Netflix, Google+, Hulu, Vimeo on Demand, and Amazon, and on Blu Ray and DVD. And I want to donate copies of the DVD/Blu Ray to any libraries, archives, and non-profits who request it and sell the remaining copies online. All this will bring <i>I Always Said Yes</i> and Wakefield Poole's remarkable story to everyone who wants to see it.</p>
<p>But I can't do it without your help. Please consider making a tax deductible donation during this fundraising drive. Non-US donors are also very welcome. Some of our most passionate audiences for the documentary have been outside the US.</p>
<p> This is the final fundraising push for <i>I Always Said Yes</i>. Reaching our goal means the documentary can be widely available just ahead of Wakefield Poole's 80th birthday in early 2016. </p>

<p>I wanted to try and change that. In the midst of production of <i>I Always Said Yes</i>, I also facilitated the restoration and re-distribution of Poole's films. Then I screened the documentary at festivals.  Now you can help me achieve the next goal - making the documentary widely available.</p>
<p><b>Yet if we don't raise at least $22,000 by the end of this campaign,  <i>I Always Said Yes</i> will no longer be available for screenings and can't be released on VOD or DVD/Blu Ray.</b> Licensing and technical issues would make it impossible. It will have to be shelved. So, I'm placing the future of this documentary and of Wakefield's story in your hands. </p>

<p>Audiences and critics think <i>I Always Said Yes</i> is entertaining, enlightening, and essential.</p>
<p>""Wakefield Poole...gets the reverential treatment he deserves in this incredibly well-reported, <b>riveting</b> documentary. Poole's life of personal and professional invention and reinvention is staggering in its own right, but his shrewd insights into the radical political and social significance of early gay porn prove him a formidable queer theorist and activist in his own right.""</p>
<div align=""right"">Ed Hardy, <i>LA Weekly</i>
</div>
<br/>
<p>""The aging Poole proves a feisty and unabashedly emotional guide to his own creative highs and private lows, acknowledging the wayward nature of his career path without a trace of self-pity. [<i>I Always Said Yes</i>] is cinema as archive—an impulse that remains <b>essential</b> even in the era where sophisticated documentary/fiction hybrids and self-reflective non-fiction practice gains much of the spotlight.""</p>
<div align=""right"">Matthew Connolly, <i>Film Comment</i>
</div>
<br/>
<p>""One of the best character studies I have ever seen... When you hear it deals with a subject like pornography, the mind tends to take the naughty route, dismissing the film as a fluff piece. But in the hands of director Jim Tushinski...Poole’s life is <b>enriching and fascinating</b>.""</p>
<div align=""right"">Kevin Thomas, <i>Progressive Pulse</i>
</div>

</div>
<div>
<b>Why do you need a publicist?</b>
</div>
<div>Just because a documentary is available to the public doesn't mean anyone knows about it. Hundreds of movies are released every week. Without a publicist working to get reviews, interviews, mentions on prominent blogs, and so on, we would never be able to reach a large part of our potential audience. <i>I Always Said Yes </i>would just get lost in the shuffle. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>How can a commercial release also be tax deductible?</b></div>
<div>My plan all along has been to make this documentary not-for-profit. Part of this decision was pragmatic - it's very difficult for documentaries, especially documentaries about LGBT artists, to make money. They usually don't. But I didn't create <i>I Always Said Yes</i> to make money. I wanted Wakefield Poole's story and his achievements to take their place in LGBT history and in the history of independent film. So I partnered with the San Francisco Film Society, who provided this project with fiscal sponsorship. The rules of fiscal sponsorship do not forbid making a profit. In fact, I have to pay taxes on all donations I receive through the SFFS. If we are lucky enough to see any profit from this commercial release, that money will go directly to paying back some of the crew who donated their time and expertise, as well as to pay for the maintenance of the web store and project web sites.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>What is Errors and Omissions insurance?</b></div>
<div>E&amp;O Insurance is vital for a documentary release. It protects the filmmakers and distributors from legal action if something in the documentary was not properly licensed. I've made every effort to ensure all music, film clips, interviews, and so on are licensed, but there is always a chance that something was overlooked or a previously unknown rights holder comes forward. Considering the sheer amount of material we used to create <i>I Always Said Yes</i>, there is always a chance a mistake was made. Errors and Omissions insurance protects us and allows us to handle any legal issues that may arise. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>What makes you think you can release this without a traditional distributor?</b></div>
<div>Because I've done it before. My production company, Gorilla Factory Productions, has successfully released three DVDs on our own (two separate Peter Berlin films and a double feature of Wakefield Poole films). We've also negotiated VOD deals and foreign DVD deals for my previous documentary <i>That Man: Peter Berlin</i> and for Peter Berlin's films. I know what needs to happen and how to get the word out. These days, for niche releases, an individual or small production company can do everything a traditional distributor does -  only better.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Can't you just cut the clips that aren't currently licensed?</b></div>
<div>If it were that easy, I would consider it. Unfortunately, the clips that need additional commercial licensing are key parts of the documentary - particularly the footage of Wakefield Poole dancing with Gwen Verdon on TV and some of the amazing footage of the Castro in the mid-1970s. Deleting this footage would hurt the documentary immeasurably. Remember that the vast majority of clips HAVE been properly licensed. The clips that have not been licensed for commercial release were licensed for Festival Only and the remaining commercial rights were more than we could pay at the time. It's a common practice for documentary filmmakers who are working with limited budgets.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Why bother with DVD/Blu Ray? No one buys them anymore.</b></div>
<div>In fact, there is still a decent market for films being released on physical media, despite what you might have heard. There are still a large number of DVD and Blu Ray collectors who prefer physical media. And there is still a segment of our potential audience who have not embraced streaming and downloading films. Releasing the documentary on physical media also allows us to create a more complete package, including deleted scenes, extra interviews, director's commentary, subtitles, photo galleries, and more. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Having a commercial DVD and Blu Ray available also means that the documentary can be donated to libraries, universities, archives, and other non-profits.</span>

</div></div>","I Always Said Yes: The Many Lives of Wakefield Poole is a fiscally sponsored project of The San Francisco Film Society, a non-profit arts  organization. Contributions to I Always Said Yes are paid to The San Francisco Film Society and are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law.


Hi, I'm Jim Tushinski, director and producer of the feature documentary I Always Said Yes: The Many Lives of Wakefield Poole, which tells the story of an overlooked gay liberation and independent filmmaking pioneer. Poole's life as dancer, choreographer, director, independent filmmaker, artist, pornographer, and chef intertwines with American and LGBT history in remarkable ways. 

For the last two years, the documentary has screened at film festivals around the world -- from Israel to New Zealand -- playing to delighted and moved audiences.
But the number of people who can see I Always Said Yes at a film festival are just a small part of the potential international audience.
I want to take the next step and make the documentary available through major Video on Demand platforms such as ITunes, Netflix, Google+, Hulu, Vimeo on Demand, and Amazon, and on Blu Ray and DVD. And I want to donate copies of the DVD/Blu Ray to any libraries, archives, and non-profits who request it and sell the remaining copies online. All this will bring I Always Said Yes and Wakefield Poole's remarkable story to everyone who wants to see it.
But I can't do it without your help. Please consider making a tax deductible donation during this fundraising drive. Non-US donors are also very welcome. Some of our most passionate audiences for the documentary have been outside the US.
 This is the final fundraising push for I Always Said Yes. Reaching our goal means the documentary can be widely available just ahead of Wakefield Poole's 80th birthday in early 2016. 



 
Through the process of making my previous documentary, That Man: Peter Berlin, I met and spent time with Wakefield Poole and realized his remarkable story and his cultural and artistic accomplishments were largely ignored or, worse, completely unknown by the general public.
I wanted to try and change that. In the midst of production of I Always Said Yes, I also facilitated the restoration and re-distribution of Poole's films. Then I screened the documentary at festivals.  Now you can help me achieve the next goal - making the documentary widely available.
Yet if we don't raise at least $22,000 by the end of this campaign,  I Always Said Yes will no longer be available for screenings and can't be released on VOD or DVD/Blu Ray. Licensing and technical issues would make it impossible. It will have to be shelved. So, I'm placing the future of this documentary and of Wakefield's story in your hands. 






Audiences and critics think I Always Said Yes is entertaining, enlightening, and essential.
""Wakefield Poole...gets the reverential treatment he deserves in this incredibly well-reported, riveting documentary. Poole's life of personal and professional invention and reinvention is staggering in its own right, but his shrewd insights into the radical political and social significance of early gay porn prove him a formidable queer theorist and activist in his own right.""
Ed Hardy, LA Weekly


""The aging Poole proves a feisty and unabashedly emotional guide to his own creative highs and private lows, acknowledging the wayward nature of his career path without a trace of self-pity. [I Always Said Yes] is cinema as archive—an impulse that remains essential even in the era where sophisticated documentary/fiction hybrids and self-reflective non-fiction practice gains much of the spotlight.""
Matthew Connolly, Film Comment


""One of the best character studies I have ever seen... When you hear it deals with a subject like pornography, the mind tends to take the naughty route, dismissing the film as a fluff piece. But in the hands of director Jim Tushinski...Poole’s life is enriching and fascinating.""
Kevin Thomas, Progressive Pulse


""Excellent...I Always Said Yes is not only a tribute to a life fully lived, but a testament to a truly talented individual who remained true to his artistic side.""
Steve Weinstein, Edge


My previous documentary, That Man: Peter Berlin, opened at the prestigious Berlin International Film Festival and was successfully released theatrically, on cable TV, and on DVD around the world.
Wakefield Poole and I have also appeared on two great podcasts talking about his life, his films, and the documentary. Check out The Projection Booth and The Rialto Report episodes.

<b>THE CASTING </b><br/>
</div>
<div>A film in reality is only as good as the people acting in it, it may have highly detailed costumes, amazing locations, and stunning camera work, but if the acting is poor the rest becomes futile. Due to this, we will be taking our casting extremely seriously putting aside a large proportion of the budget just to ensure a realistic and true representation of the characters.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>As in all aspects of Deliverance, we will be focusing on protecting the performance of the actors/ actresses. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">After all, an ODST suit, no matter how cool, is only a costume until an actor gets inside.</span>

<div>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">LOCATIONS</b><br/>
</div>
<div>In any film, locations have a huge impact on the story, but that comes at a huge cost...  in Deliverance this is no different; filming in areas such as Forests, Quarries, Cliffs, and Military Facilities. All the locations mainly are situated around the greater London area. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Despite this, we want to give you an authentic Halo Experience! This is why, if our funding goes beyond the stretch goal of $14,000, we will be heading straight to the mountain ranges of Wales! This is a location full of natural beauty and outstanding views, we believe this would hugely benefit the end viewing experience of the film, and would fit well into the Halo Universe (more info on Stretch Goals further down page).</div>

</div></div>","Halo: Deliverance is an unofficial, non-profit, live action film produced by a team of Halo Fans. Set during the time of the Insurrection (2521) an Elite ODST Soldier known as 'Elias', is sent on a covert operation to investigate claims of UNSC prisoners being held within Insurrectionist territory. What he finds changes everything.

We at Smart Wolf Productions, want to make a film which really inspires the Halo community, a film that each and every Halo Fan deserves!


With over 40 MINUTES of Action-Packed sequences and a full cast, we are reaching as high as humanly possible to deliver a fantastic film! We recognise the frustration when films you have funded in the past do not live up to what was originally pledged, or when films have dropped dead after a couple weeks of production, if you help us reach our $10,000 goal we will finish what we started!





There are a significnat amount of expenses we need to pay in order to make this film. Although what does $10,000 actually have to be spent on?
PROPS AND COSTUMES








Props and Costumes take a huge effect on the overall cost of producing the film. Keep in mind that we are not just making costumes for principle characters, but also an additional 30 EXTRAS... and that's just in one battle scene! This takes a significant toll on the budget, and we as filmmakers want nothing but the best to be shown on screen. 

As you may have noticed we already have invested in a full suit of ODST armour - ready for filming. We would like to express our gratitude to Anthony Lennon at AJL Armouries for his expect craftsmanship, and for making one bad ass costume!

List of Props:

MA37 Assault Rifles
MH6 Magnums
Explosives! (e.g. Prop Grenades and a Rocket Launcher!!)


List of Costumes:


ODST Costume

Multiple UNSC Marine Costumes
UNSC Officer Uniforms
Insurrectionist Costumes (30+)






THE CASTING 

A film in reality is only as good as the people acting in it, it may have highly detailed costumes, amazing locations, and stunning camera work, but if the acting is poor the rest becomes futile. Due to this, we will be taking our casting extremely seriously putting aside a large proportion of the budget just to ensure a realistic and true representation of the characters.

As in all aspects of Deliverance, we will be focusing on protecting the performance of the actors/ actresses. After all, an ODST suit, no matter how cool, is only a costume until an actor gets inside.




LOCATIONS

In any film, locations have a huge impact on the story, but that comes at a huge cost...  in Deliverance this is no different; filming in areas such as Forests, Quarries, Cliffs, and Military Facilities. All the locations mainly are situated around the greater London area. 

Despite this, we want to give you an authentic Halo Experience! This is why, if our funding goes beyond the stretch goal of $14,000, we will be heading straight to the mountain ranges of Wales! This is a location full of natural beauty and outstanding views, we believe this would hugely benefit the end viewing experience of the film, and would fit well into the Halo Universe (more info on Stretch Goals further down page).

<h3>Fasten Your Seatbelts, Bonnetheads!</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hi. My name is Kelly Hughes. I'm a filmmaker. Got my start creating a horror anthology on Public Access TV (anyone remember that?) in Seattle back in the '90s. But besides loving horror, I've always been a big<strong> Little House on the Prairie</strong> fan. And have wanted to work with Alison Arngrim for years.</li>
<li>I'm raising money to produce a TV series that will give Arngrim a new iconic role: the conflicted daughter of a Satanic cult leader. Will she resist the dark forces of her past? Or will she give in to them and usher in a new wave of demonic intrigue? (I'm hoping for the latter.)</li>
<li>With your help we can expose Arngrim to a new audience while giving her established fans a once-in-a-lifetime treat.</li>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
</div><div><ul>
<li>We will put your money directly into production costs: video equipment and salaries for cast &amp; crew. Our $25,000 goal for this campaign will allow us to edit Season 1 (which we have already shot), and to move directly into production for Season 2 and expand Arngrim's role. We have some amazing things planned for her character: diabolical plot twists, creepy new locations, and a Glam/Goth wardrobe that would make Stevie Nicks drool.</li>
<li>PERKS! We've got 'em. And we'll be adding some new ones as we go along, including some unique contributions from Arngrim herself (yes, one perk is having Nellie Oleson record your voicemail greeting. Imagine the reactions you'll get from that!)</li>
<li>We've structured the campaign so that regardless of the amount we raise, the production will move forward. The main thing is that the more you give, the sooner we can start on Season 2, and the more production value we can add (special effects, guest stars, etc.)</li>

<li>Can we create another role for Arngrim as iconic as Nellie Oleson? I'm not sure that can ever be repeated. But I do know we are creating something new and vivid with her character ""Leeza"". And that it will be an exciting new chapter in Arngrim's career.</li>

<p>My name is Barak Shavit
and i'm a filmmaker from Israel. I'm working on a short film and need your
support to make it happen.<br/><br/>I truly believe that we have to make a change; we live in a very hectic time, stress is everywhere, and we so often lose ourselves in media and social networks. We lose touch with our own mind and misunderstand it. <br/>As once said before ""If you don't take control over your mind, someone else will"". Let's keep up the good vibe and make a change together!  <br/></p>
<p>Six years ago i started my way as a director
and a producer. In that period i've worked wearing different hats in many projects such as the award
winning feature film <i>""It's
never too late""</i>, the short<i> ""F
is for Falling""</i> for the<i> ABC's of Death2</i> by<i> Magnolia Pictures,</i> the<i> finalist music clip</i> in
the<i> Barcelona MusiClip</i><a href=""http://musiclipfestival.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> </a><i>Festival</i> and
many other cool projects. Along with my wife Or, i've established Blue Monkeys Productions, where
we produce promotional
videos, commercials and
video clips. <br/>
The last few years have been a period of incredible growth for me, and I've learned more than I
could ever dreamed. I'm eager to go on our short film venture

<p>iSyndrome is a 20-minute narrative film taking place in Israel during the 2014 Gaza war. The stressful situation causes a brilliant brain researcher to suffer from
Depersonalization Disorder, and losing his mind. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">His wife, a post-materialist
researcher, tries everything she can to save him. After everything fails, they
try as a last resort to perform a NDE (near death experience), basing on the ""restart
effect"" it has over the human mind.</span></p><p>
This is the story. Now to take it a step back to our reality; it is documented in
many cases of NDE that consciousness activity continued after death. This is
being supported by the fact that many people could have recalled in details
events while they were clinically dead. And more than that, they sometimes
could deliver information about events they were not physically present in.
This means that consciousness is not only formed in the brain and that the
brain might be some kind of a receiver of consciousness. On top of that, most people who came back after NDE, were extremely changed in
the way they saw the world and how they acted to the people around them. <br/>
Inspired by the NDE findings and a few spiritual teachings I came up with the
term iSyndrome. iSyndrome is a term describing the misidentification of one
self. It usually <span>occurs when
consciousness identifies itself with a physical or a mental process.

Since the attention is given to the screen and not to the projector,
confusion is created. Just like you lose yourself for a moment in a movie, you
can be lost in iSyndrome for life. </span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435900007/xkwcurlnosogy9y7z6ew.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">It's

fact remains that there are still lots of things that need to be purchased,
acquired and/or rented before we can get out there and shoot iSyndrome. These
include paying for a professional cast of actors, their make-up and wardrobe,

My name is Barak Shavit
and i'm a filmmaker from Israel. I'm working on a short film and need your
support to make it happen.I truly believe that we have to make a change; we live in a very hectic time, stress is everywhere, and we so often lose ourselves in media and social networks. We lose touch with our own mind and misunderstand it. As once said before ""If you don't take control over your mind, someone else will"". Let's keep up the good vibe and make a change together!  
Six years ago i started my way as a director
and a producer. In that period i've worked wearing different hats in many projects such as the award
winning feature film ""It's
never too late"", the short ""F
is for Falling"" for the ABC's of Death2 by Magnolia Pictures, the finalist music clip in
the Barcelona MusiClip Festival and
many other cool projects. Along with my wife Or, i've established Blue Monkeys Productions, where
we produce promotional
videos, commercials and
video clips. 
The last few years have been a period of incredible growth for me, and I've learned more than I
could ever dreamed. I'm eager to go on our short film venture
and use everything I've learned and to create a great film about mind and consciousness. iSyndrome Teaser:What is iSyndrome?
iSyndrome is a 20-minute narrative film taking place in Israel during the 2014 Gaza war. The stressful situation causes a brilliant brain researcher to suffer from

researcher, tries everything she can to save him. After everything fails, they

props amongst other things), festival fees, and of course
feeding our highly skilled crew.

In addition, we need to
shoot not only the scenes themselves, but also a couple of camera and lens tests before our production period begins. We are using anamorphic lens (special

of friendship. In 1948, Amélia
who struggles to communicate with her mother after the death of her
father, is sent to the provincial town of Elvas. There, she meets
Thomas, an Austrian boy who is being fostered by her Aunt and Uncle
while they try to find his parents from whom he was separated during

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>Hi everyone! My name is Laura and I'm the director of Belonging. We have finished the short-film in the beginning of January and we have already sent it to quite a few festivals. The film was made with 2K and of course with the unimaginable help of all of Elvas population. We are a professional crew working <i>pro bono</i> because we believe in this story and all of the ideas that it stands for. It's a story about the essence of human nature, what bounds us together even when there seems to be no common ground. </p>

<h3>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">(Z) è una zombie web-series interattiva ambientata a Roma, che,
sulla falsa riga di serie come the Walking Dead e film come L’alba dei morti
viventi, prende il concetto di zombie e lo espande in nuove direzioni,
coinvolgendo direttamente gli spettatori nella serie.</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>L’idea alla base di (Z) è di prendere uno scenario di zombie
invasion, come ne abbiamo visti ormai tante volte al cinema e in televisione in
molteplici vesti e ambientazioni, e di trasportarli a Roma, per mostrare cosa
succederebbe nel caso di un’invasione zombie, e come si comporterebbe un gruppo
di persone normali, di ragazzi poco più che ventenni, catapultati
improvvisamente in una situazione del genere.</p>
<p>Inoltre, per dare un’impronta più originale all’ormai abusato
concept di invasione zombie e per caratterizzare il racconto e renderlo unico e
originale, (Z) vuole dare una motivazione e una spiegazione alla base
dell’infezione che trasforma tutti in zombie, legandola, come gli spettatori
avranno modo di scoprire man mano, a concetti che non sono mai stati esplorati
prima nell'ambito degli zombie, come la matematica, l'evoluzione della specie e
la genetica. </p>
<p>Per di più, l’universo di (Z) sarà ulteriormente corroborato da
una vera e propria interattività tra gli spettatori e la serie. </p>
<p>Sul sito di (Z), infatti, saranno presenti contenuti virali
volti a espandere l’universo narrativo e a creare un contesto credibile in cui
si svolge il racconto degli episodi, sviluppando una vera e propria realtà
parallela in cui l'invasione zombie ha il suo corso. Gli spettatori, tramite il
sito e questi contenuti speciali, potranno entrare anche loro a far parte dell'universo
di (Z) e percepire la realtà della serie come vera e tangibile.</p>
<p>Lo scopo principale del fornire questa interattività è di creare
un universo credibile dove la zombie invasion ha il suo corso, rendendo la
storia raccontata nei vari episodi soltanto uno dei molteplici e possibili
punti di vista, e rendendo la narrazione di (Z) potenzialmente ampliabile
all’infinito.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>What is (Z)?</h3>
<p>(Z) is the first zombie web-series set
in Rome, that, along the lines of series like the Walking Dead and movies like
Dawn of the Dead, uses the concept of zombie and takes it in new unexplored
directions, involving directly the viewers into the story.</p>
<p>The idea behind (Z) is to take a zombie
invasion scenario, that we have seen so many times in movies and tv in
different settings and variations, and transport it to Rome, in order to show
what it would be like if a zombie invasion was to happen there, and how a group
of regular twenty-something young people, would behave and react to it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to give a more original
imprint to the so much abused concept of zombie invasion, and in order to make
the story unique, (Z) will provide an explanation to the infection that turns
everyone in a zombie, and will tie it to concepts that have never been
introduced in a zombie story before, such as maths, evolution of the species
and genetics.</p>
<p>The universe of (Z) will also be
expanded by real time interactivity between the viewers and the series. </p>
<p>The website of the series, in fact, will
contain viral contents that will create a believable context in which the
episodes will take place, developing an actual parallel reality in which the
zombie invasion will have its course. Through the website and these viral
contents, the viewers will be able to become part of the universe of (Z) and to
perceive the story as real and tangible.</p>
<p>The main goal of this interactivity is
to create a believable universe, in which the story of the episodes represents
only one of multiple point of views, giving infinite possibilities to expand and
create new stories in the universe of (Z).</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Di cosa abbiamo bisogno?</h3>
<p>(Z) è una produzione completamente indipendente, che vuole
nascere dal web per il web. </p>
<p>Realizzare una web series zombie di questa portata con la
qualità che abbiamo in mente è un progetto molto ambizioso e impegnativo. </p>
<p>Per questo motivo, per non dover scendere a compromessi e
sacrificare la qualità nella realizzazione della serie, abbiamo deciso di
realizzare prima un mediometraggio della durata di circa 40 minuti che dia il
via alla serie vera e propria e che possa essere usato come proof of concept
della serie, per poter trovare ulteriori fondi e eventualmente produttori e
partners interessati a rendere (Z) una realtà.</p>
<p>Tutti i fondi che riusciremo a raccogliere andranno nella
realizzazione del mediometraggio e copriranno tutte le spese di realizzazione:
attori, crew, equipment, montaggio, post-produzione, sound editing,
musiche, promozione, ecc.</p>

<p>Il motivo per cui abbiamo iniziato questo progetto e vogliamo
portarlo a compimento è la nostra passione e il nostro amore per il genere
Zombie. Un genere che, in questi ultimi anni, è stato fin troppo abusato ed è
diventato stantio e ripetitivo. </p>
<p>Il nostro desiderio è di poter contribuire, nel nostro piccolo,
al genere, introducendo degli elementi nuovi e mai utilizzati prima, e usare un
setting, Roma, e dei personaggi, dei comuni ragazzi, inesplorati nel genere,
fin troppo saturo di metropoli americane e protagonisti dal grilletto facile.</p>
<p>Essendo degli appassionati del genere, è comunque nostra
intenzione rifarci ai canoni dell'Horror, e in particolare di quello italiano
vecchia scuola, mantenendo una componente thriller molto forte nella storia e
utilizzando uno stile fatto di richiami e citazioni, a partire dalla scelta di
girare tutto in bianco e nero. Tuttavia, il tutto sarà integrato da
dinamiche piu' fresche da serie televisiva moderna, introducendo
espedienti quali cliffangher e misteriose trame orizzontali che si dipaneranno
nel corso di tutta la serie.</p>
<p>Inoltre, è anche nostro desiderio di poter trattare a testa alta
un genere, l'horror, e in particolare il sottogenere zombie, nel panorama
italiano, in cui è molto difficile vedere progetti di genere validi e ai
livelli di progetti esteri (non per forza d'oltreoceano, la Francia e la Spagna
ne sono un esempio). </p>
<p>Per questo motivo è nostra prerogativa imporre uno stile personale
e di alta qualità (dalla regia e la fotografia alle musiche) al materiale
girato, come si può vedere nel teaser che abbiamo realizzato, per poter
realizzare un prodotto che sia competitivo e paragonabile a progetti esteri che
ci fanno fin troppo spesso voler dimenticare i prodotti realizzati sul suolo
nostrano.</p>
<p>Ultimo ma non ultimo, la nostra idea è di poter sfruttare, ai
fini della serie, mezzi come internet, il viral marketing e i social per poter
creare una vera community in cui gli spettatori della serie possano partecipare
e sentirsi parte del mondo di (Z).</p>

<h3><b>Why should you help us?</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>The reason why we started this project
and we want to see its end is our passion and love for the Zombie genre, a
genre that, in these last years, has been too much abused and has become still
and repetitive.</p>
<p>Our wish is to contribute, however
small, to the genre, introducing new elements that has not been used before,
and to use a setting, Rome, and characters, just some young people, that have
not been explored before in the genre, too much saturated with American
metropolises and trigger-happy characters.</p>
<p>Since we are very passionate about the
genre, we will navigate within the canons of the Horror genre, especially the
old school Italian horror, by keeping a strong thriller nature to the story,
and by employing a style rich with references and homages, starting with
choosing to shoot in black and white. Though, this will be integrated with
fresh dynamics belonging to most modern TV series, such as cliffhangers and horizontal
plots that will be explored throughout the whole series.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is our wish to treat a
genre, Horror and in particular the Zombie genre, in the italian market, where
it's very hard to see strong genre projects that can go head to head with
foreign projects.</p>
<p>For this reason, we intend to
characterize the production of the series with a very personal style with a
very high quality value (from the directing and the photography to the music),
as you can see in the teaser we shot, in order to have a product that can be
considered competitive and can be compared to foreign projects of the same
kind, that nowadays stand on much higher sole than most of italian projects.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we intend to exploit
the means provided by the internet, viral marketing and social networks to
create an actual community where viewers of the episodes can participate and
feel they are part of the world of (Z).</p>

</div></div>","Che cos'è (Z)? 

(Z) è una zombie web-series interattiva ambientata a Roma, che,
sulla falsa riga di serie come the Walking Dead e film come L’alba dei morti
viventi, prende il concetto di zombie e lo espande in nuove direzioni,
coinvolgendo direttamente gli spettatori nella serie.

L’idea alla base di (Z) è di prendere uno scenario di zombie
invasion, come ne abbiamo visti ormai tante volte al cinema e in televisione in
molteplici vesti e ambientazioni, e di trasportarli a Roma, per mostrare cosa
succederebbe nel caso di un’invasione zombie, e come si comporterebbe un gruppo
di persone normali, di ragazzi poco più che ventenni, catapultati
improvvisamente in una situazione del genere.
Inoltre, per dare un’impronta più originale all’ormai abusato
concept di invasione zombie e per caratterizzare il racconto e renderlo unico e
originale, (Z) vuole dare una motivazione e una spiegazione alla base
dell’infezione che trasforma tutti in zombie, legandola, come gli spettatori
avranno modo di scoprire man mano, a concetti che non sono mai stati esplorati
prima nell'ambito degli zombie, come la matematica, l'evoluzione della specie e
la genetica. 
Per di più, l’universo di (Z) sarà ulteriormente corroborato da
una vera e propria interattività tra gli spettatori e la serie. 
Sul sito di (Z), infatti, saranno presenti contenuti virali
volti a espandere l’universo narrativo e a creare un contesto credibile in cui
si svolge il racconto degli episodi, sviluppando una vera e propria realtà
parallela in cui l'invasione zombie ha il suo corso. Gli spettatori, tramite il
sito e questi contenuti speciali, potranno entrare anche loro a far parte dell'universo
di (Z) e percepire la realtà della serie come vera e tangibile.
Lo scopo principale del fornire questa interattività è di creare
un universo credibile dove la zombie invasion ha il suo corso, rendendo la
storia raccontata nei vari episodi soltanto uno dei molteplici e possibili
punti di vista, e rendendo la narrazione di (Z) potenzialmente ampliabile
all’infinito.

What is (Z)?
(Z) is the first zombie web-series set
in Rome, that, along the lines of series like the Walking Dead and movies like
Dawn of the Dead, uses the concept of zombie and takes it in new unexplored
directions, involving directly the viewers into the story.
The idea behind (Z) is to take a zombie
invasion scenario, that we have seen so many times in movies and tv in
different settings and variations, and transport it to Rome, in order to show
what it would be like if a zombie invasion was to happen there, and how a group
of regular twenty-something young people, would behave and react to it.
Furthermore, to give a more original
imprint to the so much abused concept of zombie invasion, and in order to make
the story unique, (Z) will provide an explanation to the infection that turns
everyone in a zombie, and will tie it to concepts that have never been
introduced in a zombie story before, such as maths, evolution of the species
and genetics.
The universe of (Z) will also be
expanded by real time interactivity between the viewers and the series. 
The website of the series, in fact, will
contain viral contents that will create a believable context in which the
episodes will take place, developing an actual parallel reality in which the
zombie invasion will have its course. Through the website and these viral
contents, the viewers will be able to become part of the universe of (Z) and to
perceive the story as real and tangible.
The main goal of this interactivity is
to create a believable universe, in which the story of the episodes represents
only one of multiple point of views, giving infinite possibilities to expand and
create new stories in the universe of (Z).


Di cosa abbiamo bisogno?
(Z) è una produzione completamente indipendente, che vuole
nascere dal web per il web. 
Realizzare una web series zombie di questa portata con la
qualità che abbiamo in mente è un progetto molto ambizioso e impegnativo. 
Per questo motivo, per non dover scendere a compromessi e
sacrificare la qualità nella realizzazione della serie, abbiamo deciso di
realizzare prima un mediometraggio della durata di circa 40 minuti che dia il
via alla serie vera e propria e che possa essere usato come proof of concept
della serie, per poter trovare ulteriori fondi e eventualmente produttori e
partners interessati a rendere (Z) una realtà.
Tutti i fondi che riusciremo a raccogliere andranno nella
realizzazione del mediometraggio e copriranno tutte le spese di realizzazione:
attori, crew, equipment, montaggio, post-produzione, sound editing,
musiche, promozione, ecc.
Abbiamo bisogno del tuo aiuto!


What do we need?
(Z) is a totally independent production,
that is born on the web for the web.
The making of a project of this
magnitude with the quality standards that we want to achieve is a very
ambitious and challenging task.
For this reason, in order to not have to
make compromises and sacrifice the quality, we decided to make a
 medium-length feature, about 40 minutes long, that is meant to be the
starting point of the series and that can be used as a proof of concept for the
whole series, to find the necessary funds, and eventually producers and
partners interested to make (Z) happen.
All the money that we will be able to
raise will go into the making of the medium-feature length, and will cover all
the production expenses: actors, crew, equipment, editing, post-production,
sound editing, music, promotion, etc.

<p>ABOUT  ""THE HAG""</p>
<p>      A innocent essay in a college creative writing class sets off a terrifying and deadly chain of events.  Girls just having fun, inadvertently summons an evil entity with a deadly thirst!  Now, they must figure out how to stop her. Will they be able to, or will she take them all? Find out in 2016! The Hag!<br/></p>
<p>     We are so excited to get this project out of pre-production and into Production.   We are scheduled to start shooting in the beautiful city of Shreveport LA in late spring.  We already have crew in place, locations being scouted, and the script is in the hands of our Director.  Now we just need your help.  The $12,000 just gets us thru the pre-production.  We will need more to complete, so don't stop giving when we reach the first goal.   The sequel is being written right now, as I already let slip, and  we want to make this the next great horror series.  The next Freddy, Michael, and Jason all rolled into one!  However, we can only do it with your help!  </p>

<p>FUNDRAISER.</p>
</div><div>     We are running a one of a kind fundraiser that will help us raise the funds, and be fun for you.  We are letting you help cast the movie.  We have posted pictures of some young and up coming super starts  that all want to be in our movie.  However, only one girl and one guy will get a featured roll.  You will vote with your donations under their names.  Make sure you check back from time to time and make sure your favorite is still in the lead!  Help make two young actors dreams come true. </div><div>   Hey Everyone, just wanted to clear up some confusion about our Indiegogo Fundraiser. We are asking for funding to make our feature film ""The Hag"". We feel this will become the next big horror franchise. We decided it would be fun to run a competition that would give one young lady and one young gentleman a ""Featured Roll"" in the movie. This means a guaranteed speaking roll. The others will get to be ""Extras"", which means they will be in the movie, but not in a speaking roll. Extras are people in the background such as in a classroom, or party scene.

ABOUT  ""THE HAG""
      A innocent essay in a college creative writing class sets off a terrifying and deadly chain of events.  Girls just having fun, inadvertently summons an evil entity with a deadly thirst!  Now, they must figure out how to stop her. Will they be able to, or will she take them all? Find out in 2016! The Hag!
     We are so excited to get this project out of pre-production and into Production.   We are scheduled to start shooting in the beautiful city of Shreveport LA in late spring.  We already have crew in place, locations being scouted, and the script is in the hands of our Director.  Now we just need your help.  The $12,000 just gets us thru the pre-production.  We will need more to complete, so don't stop giving when we reach the first goal.   The sequel is being written right now, as I already let slip, and  we want to make this the next great horror series.  The next Freddy, Michael, and Jason all rolled into one!  However, we can only do it with your help!  

FUNDRAISER.
     We are running a one of a kind fundraiser that will help us raise the funds, and be fun for you.  We are letting you help cast the movie.  We have posted pictures of some young and up coming super starts  that all want to be in our movie.  However, only one girl and one guy will get a featured roll.  You will vote with your donations under their names.  Make sure you check back from time to time and make sure your favorite is still in the lead!  Help make two young actors dreams come true.    Hey Everyone, just wanted to clear up some confusion about our Indiegogo Fundraiser. We are asking for funding to make our feature film ""The Hag"". We feel this will become the next big horror franchise. We decided it would be fun to run a competition that would give one young lady and one young gentleman a ""Featured Roll"" in the movie. This means a guaranteed speaking roll. The others will get to be ""Extras"", which means they will be in the movie, but not in a speaking roll. Extras are people in the background such as in a classroom, or party scene. I can tell you that NONE of these six want to be an extra. They all want the featured rolls, and need your help!    Voting starts at $1, but if you want to, and are able, you can put more money on your favorite and get some really nice ""perks"".   Thank you for your support!

What is Three Days of Glory
Three Days of Glory is a web series submerged in the culture of cosplaying, conventions, and all the things in between. From the ‘Noobs’ to the ‘Veterans’, the ‘Elite’ to the ‘Wanna-be’s’ and the ‘Super Fan’s’ to the ‘Haters’; witness how their lives weave together into a web of love, hatred, lust, and envy that will make you ask yourself, is life truly better behind the mask? 
  

We as creators want to bring you this world in a beautifully and meticulously crafted web series. Most web series asking for money will give you a micro amount of content for your money. We want to produce 13-16 Issues (episodes) for the first Volume (season).

<h3>The World of Acid Reign</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>Hi, Ben and Nathan here and we are passionate storytellers
and love the dystopian, post-apocalyptic genre. Over the past half year we've been
focused on a story that has grown into this vast and epic world; the world of
Acid Reign.</p>
<p><b>Vignettes</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>To begin the process, we are filming a series of vignettes.
These are short films, only a few minutes long, which will introduce you to the
world and characters of Acid Reign. More importantly, they will give us an
opportunity to define our style, look and production process for the next step –
the Acid Reign feature film. This crowdfunding campaign is specifically for
the production of our vignettes, but will have a real and lasting impact on the
feature. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>The Story</b></p>
<p>Acid Reign is a film about a post-post-apocalyptic world. The story follows Ripp and his group of smugglers through a dangerous and mutated landscape. While dealing with life in this post-apocalyptic world they are pulled into a war they didn't even know existed. </p>
<p><b>Producer's Notes</b></p>
<p>We're excited to bring this epic world to you, but we have ran into a hiccup. The story has a ""character"" we need to acquire. Ripp's car. Though some may say a car is a car is a car, but in our case Ripp's car is critical to the identity of not only our protagonist, but to the story itself. </p>
<p>We have most of the elements in place to move ahead with production except for this key element and a handful of props. Your contribution will allow us to get what we need to create this world and provide a new playground for the post-apocalyptic genre. We are passionate and know you are, too. With your help we will rock the post-apocalyptic world.<br/></p>

<p><b>Back Story</b></p>
<p>In a hundred years from now a nuclear apocalypse will rain down upon the Earth. In a hundred years after that war, life on this planet will undergo an extreme transformation and never be the same. But then again, some things never change. Factions will rise and fall. Politicians will struggle for power and domination.</p>
<p>Like the old pirates of the seven seas, Smugglers become the middlemen in commerce and trade. They feed a black market that flourishes under the impotent leadership of the Nucrean ruling class. Amongst the smugglers, Ripp has become an expert at his craft and is known for having a style all his own. With his cohorts, Lilly and Gus, he travels the broken byways of a once great civilization. Scavenging the wastelands for plunder and spoils that will go to the highest bidder.</p>
<p>The lifestyle, though lucrative is not without risk, for along the waste, between civilization and the epicenter of nuclear fallout, is an area known as the Fringe, where nuclear radiation is still well above any safe limit. The Fringe is where packs of animals, who were once men, now roam and hunt! These “Fringers,” as they are called, are derelict nut jobs who have been demented by the high levels of radiation within the Fringe. They are only alive, because they don’t realize they're supposed to be dead.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><i>Since
the disappearance of her parents, Anna has felt her world slowly tilting on its
axis. She’s found her faith tested and is struggling to keep hope alive, but
it’s the increasingly toxic relationship with her brother, Anton, that is
poisoning Anna’s spirit the most. Will Anna find the strength to stand fast
against the rising waves, or will she let go and succumb to the pressing
loneliness? </i></p>
<p>
</p><p>_____________________________________________________________________________</p><p>Beyond the faith we may have, or beliefs we
might hold, hope is like a spring within our hearts that we drink from when
times are at their toughest. But there can only be hope if we allow there to
be. So, in the cruelest twist of irony, often when someone is dying of thirst,
the spring runs dry.</p>
<p>Inspired by the complexities of Darren
Aronofsky’s lead characters in <i>The
Wrestler</i> (2008) and <i>Black Swan</i>
(2010), <i>KNOTS</i> is driven by the
reality of hopelessness: sometimes the respite can be bittersweet, and despite
everything, you can’t be your own hero. Other times, an individual sees hope as
black and white, the difference between success and failure. They hold
themselves to a standard others can’t support, let alone appreciate. Elements
of this isolation and desperation manifest in the Anna and Anton characters,
referencing the sheer destructive focus of Damien Chazelle’s <i>Whiplash</i> (2014).</p>
<p>However, the film’s thematic origins come
from a letter of correspondence between two of the world’s most powerful men at
the time. Errol Morris’ documentary<i>, The
Fog Of War</i> (2003), considers the lessons Robert McNamara, former US
Secretary for Defense (1961-68), learned during his tenure. At one point,
McNamara refers to a letter he received from the then leader of the Soviet
Union, Nikita Khrushchev, who cautioned, “we and you ought not to pull on the
ends of a rope which you have tied the knots of war. Because the more the two
of us pull, the tighter the knot will be tied.” Khrushchev’s poetic political
image of the <i>knots of war</i> is the
perfect metaphor of conflict for the film’s key relationship. Throughout the
story, Anna and Anton each tug at this rope, questioning the most important
parts of each other: religion, family, strength of will.</p>
<p>We will watch Anna walk along a cliff edge,
her brother calling up to her from the dark valley below, and those who care
about her trying to coax her away from the precipice. In the end, it’s her
yearning for freedom – to be unburdened and relieved of doubt – that grips Anna
most tightly. </p>

Is anything we see and do actually real or is it simply a figment of our overactive imagination.  My name is Patrick Mattes. I am the Director of the short film Conscious.

We plan on overcoming these obstacles by buying the appropriate costumes, building the most believable and realistic sets, and renting props such as the fake syringe.    Other Ways You Can Help Unfortunately some people can't contribute, but that doesn't mean that you can't help:  Please help us get the word out and make some noise about our campaign.

<p><b>Adventure of a Lifetime</b></p>
<p>My name is Luke Jones, and I’m
currently a sophomore at Indiana University Purdue University of Indianapolis
studying Media Arts.  I have been working
on developing a board game about bringing the video game fighting experience to
life on the tabletop. I’d soon like to show off the completed prototype at Gen
Con this August of 2015.</p><p><b>What is the Clash of Adventurers Game?</b></p><p>Clash of Adventurers is a 2 player fighting game set in the fictional lands of Paradise Islands. Adventurers from around the islands duke it out over treasures using unique abilities and their love for adventure to lead them to victory. The game simulates 2D fighting games such as Street Fighter, Killer Instinct, and Injustice and includes other mechanics form other fighting games. Its goal is to simulate  the real feeling of playing a fighting game, removing all of the difficulties players have when learning fighting games like controllers and hours needed to learn characters. With these difficulties removed, players can join the clash and learn the details of each fighter quickly and be able to perform cool combos and moves!</p>

<p><b>Every Cent Counts</b></p>
<p>No matter how much money I receive,
it will help support my project as I juggle school and other academic

Amber and her S.H.E.! sisters used spoken word paired with choreography to create 10-25 min performances that explored race, gender identity, sexuality, feminism, whiteness and power in America as experienced by women from vastly different social locations. As an individual artist, Amber has continued to perform her poetry with a focus on the experience of Black women in America, colorism, love as form of resistance. Amber believes that viewing the world through a Queer, Black feminist lens creates a space for progressive transformation.

is a wonderful story which we wish to tell as a short film full of

Natura
is a wonderful story which we wish to tell as a short film full of
action and adventure. We will use a mix of animation with real footage. It will be like Microcosmos meets Indiana Jones: sounds great, doesn’t it? 


Like every year,
we will produce a new short film with the members from Chamán
Animation Studio. Our objectives are increasingly ambitious and this
year is no exception since we will be combining film with realistic
animation.

Azul Maduro (teaser de cortometraje 2014)

We want to use all our experience to make a twenty minute film. We wish to make a new short film with all of you, the fundraisers, to which you will have access, and will also include two exclusive premieres followed by a party for all the fundraisers who choose that.Your help will be the water that will make the seed we have planted grow. We will take care of the hard work, since that is what we do best.
Natura
is the story of a miniature world, a small park full of mysterious
and magical things. Impulsive and cheeky, Rose, our heroine, lives
within a world that is about to change. She will have to find a way
to save her people and herself.


In a nutshell,
Natura
tells a story of adventure and solidarity. After all, we are not

</div></div>","About the project 
Have you ever thought how you would spend municipal money? Would you build roads or maybe finance sport classes for kids? How would it be to decide about it with your neighbours? Actually, many people around the world do it; it’s called participatory budgeting.The film “La Comuna 9. Reclaiming a city” aims at showing what happened when the people of Comuna 9 – a district in Medellin, Colombia, were allowed to take control over the resources available through participatory budgeting.The film takes you for a fascinating trip through the barrios of Comuna 9 where you will meet ordinary people who let the politics into their daily lives in order to transform the reality they live in. It is also a ‘manual’ of participatory budgeting that, hopefully, will be an inspiration for other community leaders around the world.
 

Where are we?


We completed shooting in 2013, currently we are on the final stage of editing. Up until this point it was a self-funded project. To finish the film and share it with the world we need more professional support. We will use raised money for color correction, sound mix and animations that will make sophisticated democratic process more clear and understandable. 

Why participatory democracy?Democracy is on the crossroads.The tools of the representative 
democracy, so deeply rooted in European and American tradition, are no 
longer suitable to answer the needs of the modern, ever-changing 
society. So if we want to secure fair and inclusive society, we need to 
find an alternative to the existing political system.Social movements 
all around the world, which are now growing stronger than ever, demand 
citizens’ inclusion in decision-­making processes. What they are trying 
to prove is that people know best what they need in their lives so their
 voice must be heard.Participatory
 budgeting, among many tools of participatory democracy, is now in the 
spotlight. This method provides people with an opportunity to decide 
about the money that comes from taxes. First implemented in Porto 
Allegre, Brazil, 25 years ago, participatory budgeting is now spreading 
around the world.Why Medellin?
Medellin is the second biggest city in Colombia. Once rapidly developing, it became a refuge for people running away from ongoing war. It is worth noting that Medellin did not hold the disgraceful name of the most violent city in Columbia without a reason. In this favorable circumstances created a space for illegal activities of drug cartels emerged quickly. Moreover, the ongoing military conflict between leftist guerrillas and the army supported by paramilitary groups has deeply transformed urban areas. 
It was social movement that brought an answer to the rising crisis, corruption and violence, demanding inclusion in urban governance and redistribution of public resources. Participatory budgeting was one of grassroots movement proposal. 


What is the story?
The film pictures four months of the participatory budgeting process in the Communne 9. The social situation in the district mirrors the everyday reality of the whole city – with highly active drug cartels, growing slums, urban wars between neighborhoods, but also with strongly rooted resistance against violence and poverty.
From July to October 2013 we accompanied local leaders as they were discussing and looking for solutions for the problems of their neighborhoods. You will see them struggling to identify the  needs of their community, negotiating with authorities, discussing how to design appropriate projects and mobilize members of the neighbors to be more willing to participate.
Showing us the kitchen of the participatory budgeting process, and the way around community is Sandra – municipal civil servant with grassroots background who serves as an intermediary between authorities and the community. Sandra, mother of two teenage sons, local leader with strong belief in humanity, is extremely compassionate, but at the same time critical of the reality she lives in.


Who are we?

We are two sociologists striving to find a balance between conducting social research and filmmaking. In 2013 we were in Medelin on 5-month internship in the field of participatory urban planning and civic engagement. That was when we decided to make a film about participatory budgeting. Being able to live and work in the dynamic social scene of Medellin made us rethink the concept of democracy and civil engagement  in politics.This movie is the record of our everyday reality we experienced in Medellin, and a way to say „thank you” to people who showed us how social alternatives can be put into practice.

He had his first camera at age 11 and constantly make films with the help of his friend, Ben Griffin. As he got older, he put the camera down and focused on school. That is until he started to get back into making movies with his friends Austin Barr and Jimmy Zacher. After a few semesters in college, Anthony decided to make his own path. He wanted to make something. So, he began writing a series loosely based off of him and his old friends and, after finishing the first season, decided to make the show a reality.

</div></div>","Who am I? 

My name is Wisdom Da Costa. I am an Independent Councillor for the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, and also the 2014/15 Chairman of the largest
local residents association in Windsor with around 1,100 member households. I
care about people.



What am I trying to achieve?
I
want to raise funds to help me get elected as the Independent Community MP for
the Windsor Constituency and this is why.
Politics is broken & Democracy is crumbling, with voting figures and confidence in
party politicians at an all time low, with polls revealing, ""deep levels of cynicism towards politicians among the British public.""



I hear many people saying that they are fed with politicians, ""They're all the same, making promises they will never keep, fiddling expenses, putting party loyalty before people's needs, behaving in an immature manner (e.g. Prime Minister's Question time), and out of touch with the voter""

I think it’s time to do things differently,

To put people first,
To fight for local issues rather than party politics,
To listen, rather than preach, using technology to engage with residents,
To be honest, 
To attack issues, and not individuals, and
For politicians to act with integrity & lead by example








Einstein is reported to
have said that the definition of “Insanity: doing the same thing over and over
again and expecting different results.”
So, let's change things
for good, the good of the people.

What you can help me achieve
You
can help me to develop a better standard of democracy, one that 



Puts people first,


Engages with folk where they are, young or old,


Empowers voters, 


Uses technology to better connect the individuals, you, with their
elected representatives, and allows a greater level of accountability, integrity, responsiveness, and transparency including emerging crowd-sourcing platforms
like Vouliwatch emerging around the world.



Together
we can bring democracy, health, alive and well into 21st Century
So
help me help you, help our communities.
NB The Windsor Constituency includes 70,000 voters, covering a wide area
including Ascot, Binfield, Bracknell, Colnbrook, Datchet, Old Windsor,
Sunningdale, Sunninghill, Warfield, Windsor, Winkfield, or Wraysbury
   

 

What We Need & What You Get
I
need around £14,000 funding for a basic General Election campaign, to reach out
to 70,000 voters across the Constituency, or £20,000 for a more substantial campaign, broken down into;


Leaflets   -
£5,000


Postage, packaging, delivery  -
£5,000


Software, deposit, and promo-materials  -
£2,000


Website & IT  -
£1,000


Perks  -
£1,000

Second phase leaflet & delivery - £6,000

If
I don’t achieve the goal, we will have to deliver fewer leaflets, and run a
more virtual campaign.

The perks
We’ve
split our perks into two types; what you get now; what you get if I am elected;


£10   -
Thank you email, email updates, name on website, as above plus


£50   - Certificate,
mentioned in election speech, plus the above


£100 - Thank you
card, coffee morning briefing, plus the above


£250- Individual
briefing, plus the above


£500 - Evening
engagement, plus the above


£1,000  - up
to two evening engagements, plus the above


If
I am elected, you will also get;


Thank you on House of Commons paper – all


Visit to House of Commons – all


Tea at House of Commons – for donations at £250 or above


Attend evening engagement as MP – for donations at £1,000 or above





The impact 
Your
contribution will 



Help me get established in the Windsor Constituency, and it will also help to


Create a template to empower you, and others up and down the Country, to raise
the standard of democracy, and also run Independent “people focused” campaigns.



So
your contribution could create a movement in the UK that puts the needs of the
people first, ahead of party political tribalism and dogma. You come first.
I’ve
mentioned my track record above, and you can read more about me at www.wwra.org.uk
or do Google search on me.
Follow
me on Twitter @wisdomdacosta, or on Facebook, “Councillor Wisdom Da Costa” – just watch out for the cheesy
grin :-)   


The Risks & challenges  
At a time when
the reputation of MP’s has never been at a lower ebb, interest in the general
election has never been higher across all age groups whether teens, twenties,
or eighties.
The population
has never been more unsure of where to cast their vote.
And
as Rick Edwards recently pointed out in a Ted Talk, ""How to get young people to vote"", we can engage people,
and our young adults, we can change who influences our government, and make democracy representative of all.
So
I will 



Continue to fight for people locally on issues – I am already well
publicized locally because of this


Engage with them, and convince opposition, though discussions on social
media, and through blog articles at the popular local website www.wwra.org.uk


Create a media campaign to excite the media – Independent voices is a developing theme across the country see Chris Davis MBE & Queen guitarist, DrBrian May


Produce and deliver leaflets to each household

Meet influencers up and down the Constituency to move them


I
have a track record in Windsor



As an advocate for local people, and local issues, fighting on issues
party politicians shy away from like Heathrow noise, and planning
irregularities


Acting with honesty & integrity explaining clearly what is really
going on with the Budget, Community Wardens, and planning


Attacking issues not people despite dirty tricks being used against me


Holding myself accountable to people, telling residents what I am doing, using Blogs, social
media, and traditional media


Empowering people
with events, campaigns, and connecting them together and to others


Meeting people
where they are face-to-face, in meetings, and using social media, blogs, and
other social portals like Streetlife, or Facebook groups, Twitter, Google+, Youtube etc..



Have
a look at my “Independent Behaviour Model”,  and check out my Councillor Blogs at http://www.wwra.org.uk/ – this is how I do business; openness, honesty, integrity, humility, but also fearless tenacity.

<p><b>Will Brainboard v2 become available again if the campaign does
not succeed?</b></p>
<p>In small quantities it is not possible to reach this price,
in terms of manufacturing and shipping. But you can still purchase Brainboard
v2 at retail price and higher shipping charges.</p>
<p><b>Why are we doing a Flexible funding Campaign?</b></p>
<p>Because of the financial restrictions imposed by the Government of
India we cannot go for fixed funding.</p>
<p><b>What will I get?</b></p>
<p>Back us by choosing a perk. You will receive Brainboard v2 at a cheaper
price and if our campaign exceeds our goal you will be eligible for all the Stretch
Goal benefits. Also your name will be featured on our website.</p>
<p><b>Who pays customs fee on international orders?</b></p>
<p>Customs fee (import duties/taxes) are the backer’s
responsibility and are not included in the perks. These are imposed by the
receiving country, so they will be different for each country. In most
countries there will not be any duties for single boards.  Please check with your country's customs office
to determine what these additional costs will be. In most cases there will be no duties for single boards.</p>
<p><b>Can
I get more than one board?</b></p>
<p>Sure! If you want more than one board, just multiply the perk
amount by required number and add additional $10 per additional perk for
shipping.</p>
<p><b>What
if I forgot to add shipping?</b></p>
<p>Simply select $25 perk to add international shipping. Shipping within India is $7.</p>
<p><b>What
is the need of enclosure?</b></p>
<p>Brainboard v2 has a compatible industrial
grade laser cut aluminum enclosure. It is not mandatory to use it if you are
using your own cooling setup. Proper ventilation allows power electronics to
operate at full capacity and also reduces their chances of failure. The
enclosure also provides a compact and rugged solution for electronics.</p>
<p><b>Can I use the CPU module as a standalone development board?</b></p>
<p>CPU module is
designed in a manner that it allows the module to operate as a great standalone
development board. It is compatible with popular mbed online compiler. It has 4
status LEDs, Ethernet Interface, USB device, RTC, ISP, reset, Micro SD card,
standard JTAG header and all pins broken out to male headers.</p>
<p><b>What
all host software are supported?</b></p>
<p>Brainboard v2
communicates with Host software using standard G-codes. Wide range of
connectivity options allow Brainboard v2 to communicate via standard USB or
telnet. And we have tested it with most common host software. </p>
<p><b>What
kind of display does GLCD control panel have?</b><br/>
GLCD control panel has 128x64 resolution serial LCD which communicates with
Brainboard v2 over SPI interface. Standard version of panel comes with a green
backlight. Blue and white backlight versions are also available.  </p>
<p><b>Is the firmware updatable?</b><br/>
You can update main firmware (Smoothieware) using one of the available
methods-via Ethernet, via USB, via SD Card or via serial boot loader. </p>
<p>To update bootloader only option available is via serial
bootloader for that you need to connect FTDI cable to serial expansion port.</p>
<p>You can download pre compiled binaries from our website.</p>
<p><b>What all SD cards are compatible?</b></p>
<p>Any Micro SD or Standard SD cards with capacities up to 32GB are
compatible.</p>
<p><b>Where can I find source files?</b></p>
<p>Brainboard v2 runs on a customized version Smoothieware and SD bootloader.
You can find link to all the software and hardware design files on our website.
</p>
<p>Original Smoothie firmware can be downloaded from Smoothieware
website.</p>
<p><b>Why so many jumpers on the bottom side?</b></p>
<p>These jumpers allow Brainboard v2 to operate in different configurations

<p>The 60s were a tipping point in US history – and 1963 was
the crux of that era.</p>
<p>One year after the Cuban missile crisis, tensions ran hot
between Washington and Moscow. Spies lurked in the shadows while nuclear war
loomed on the horizon. </p>
<p>It was a time of great technological advancement, with the
space race in full sprint and great strides in transportation, communication
and computing power made by both countries. </p>
<p>It was a year of great tragedy, with the assassination of President
Kennedy on November 22, 1963. </p>

</div><p></p>Born and raised in Southern California, storytelling is in AJ’s blood. Graduating high school in 2011, AJ decided to teach himself the art of writing, producing and directing.<div>
<br/><div>
<div>
<div>
<div style=""display: inline !important;""></div>
<p>Combining a self-imposed regimen of book learning with a slew of internships and PA jobs, AJ
honed his cinematic craft with a singular goal in mind: to direct a feature film in 2015.
</p>
<p>Four years later, AJ has made filmmaking his full time career. At age 21, he has written two feature
films, served as DP on a handful of cable shows, worked for Clint Eastwood’s Malpaso Productions
and directed several short films, music videos and documentaries.
</p>
<p>His full-service video production company, Section 3 Films, has serviced hundreds of small
projects and is lauded for its cost effectiveness and efficiency.
</p>
<p>He hopes to apply this invaluable education on his first feature film “Red Fish Blue Fish” –
currently in pre-production.

</div></div>","Moscow, 1963- A lone American operative receives orders to hijack
a nuclear missile and launch it at the United States. 
Half-way across the globe a military industrialist – Arthur Blackmark
– wakes up to the sound of a red telephone. 
Red Fish Blue is a 1963 Cold War Spy Thriller. It follows
Arthur Blackmark, Timothy Daniels and Alexi Popolovski as they race against the
clock to stop an international incident, which threatens the very existence of
the world.
The 60s were a tipping point in US history – and 1963 was
the crux of that era.
One year after the Cuban missile crisis, tensions ran hot
between Washington and Moscow. Spies lurked in the shadows while nuclear war
loomed on the horizon. 
It was a time of great technological advancement, with the
space race in full sprint and great strides in transportation, communication
and computing power made by both countries. 
It was a year of great tragedy, with the assassination of President
Kennedy on November 22, 1963. 
These elements perfectly set the stage for an action packed,
high stakes political thriller.As historical fiction, Red Fish Blue Fish aims to mesh with history, using real events to create a plausible story that could have (and may have) happened. $15,000 - Finish Production $35,000 - Finish Post Production (Unlock an exclusive clip)$65,000 - All Production Costs Covered and production value increased

Section 3 Films is dedicated to low-budget, high quality
film production. Funding will be used efficiently and effectively to
deliver a truly cinematic experience to the screen. 
All funding will go directly toward the cost of
producing this film. Section 3 Films has raised enough to finish set
construction and make it through the first half of the shoot but the film
requires additional funding to complete the project. 
Funding will go directly to:
Work on Red Fish Blue Fish began Summer of 2014.It took AJ three months to go from initial concept to first full draft of the screen-play.After completing the second draft, mid-august, the film went immediately into pre-production and casting.As his first feature film, AJ opted for a nearly year-long pre-production process. This allowed him time to construct the various sets needed to complete the film.By mid-December the core cast and crew was assembled, gathering together for the first time at a table read where the script came to life.January through March consisted of set construction, casting, crewing and preparation for the first official shoot day on Easter Sunday, April 5, 2015.After April 5, construction will continue until May 4, when the rest of the film will be shot on stage in Alhambra.

Red Fish Blue Fish was selected for Panavision’s “New
Filmmaker Program” – a highly competitive grant allowing us to film on an Arri Alexa with Panavision Primo Lenses!

<p></p>
<p>By chronicling these powerful stories, this film provides an unparalleled opportunity to empower, engage, and enlighten worldwide audiences. The Islamic State - constantly spewing out an ideology of hatred, oppression, and murder – has become a global bane with widespread ramifications for an increasing number of people, wreaking havoc with unwarranted bloodshed tantamount to full-fledged war. </p>
<p></p>
<p>What sets this documentary apart from the plethora of news stories surging out of the war against ISIL is that the footage and stories come straight from the front lines - of valiant fighters who are battling IS on the ground and at the grassroots level. The Islamic State has made it clear that it will not hesitate to kill aid workers, reporters, or prisoners of war in public and brutal ways. The constant state of paranoia has profoundly discouraged the reporters and filmmakers who were prepared to go out and get first-hand accounts. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Freelance journalist and documentary maker, Bud, has witnessed the horrors of war first-hand. He shares his experiences with the world at large so that these anonymous and valiant soldiers have a face, and a voice. In this documentary, Bud will travel to both Iraq and Syria to contact the Kurdish boys and girls, some as young as 16, who battle the IS on our behalf. </p>
<p></p>

He delves deeply into the young soldiers’ pasts, and their hopes for the future.<p></p>
<p>It has become increasingly difficult for major broadcasters and news agencies to cover Iraq and especially Syria. The kidnappings and continuing battles with the Islamic State make it almost impossible for journalists to travel to those countries. Many broadcasters and news agencies are, therefore, dependent on freelancers. These are often highly-motivated and idealistic people who put their lives on the line because they care. The job of freelance journalists in war zones is never without danger. The documentary follows such a journalist and finds out what inspires and motivates him to go to dangerous countries. When he meets the soldiers fighting this war, they discover they have something in common. As much as this documentary is about war and the fight against the Islamic State, it is also about dreams, devotion, and drive: things we can all identify with.</p>

<p>Just how does it feel to be young, naïve and untroubled and then, in the blink of an eye, be in fear of your life and not have anyone to run to, or anywhere to seek refuge? You must fight; kill or be killed. </p>
<p>As a soldier, his watchtower overlooks the small town. He is ultimately the one responsible for the protection of friends and families. He is no stranger to gunfights and the horrors of war, and although his shots are precise, his heart is not in it.</p>
<p>Since he became a member of the army, he has learned that both of his parents were murdered when Islamic State fighters ambushed his father’s cafe and brutally murdered everyone inside.</p>
<p>He dreams of returning to his home and becoming the successor of his father's pizzeria as an act of honoring and continuing his family’s tradition. However, his dream has become a hopeless whisper among the explosions since he joined the Kurdish army. </p>

The
only distinction between Rochin and any other 16-year-old is that she is compelled
to keep her childhood behind. She must take up arms to secure the ones she
loves.</p>
<p>Can you imagine
your 16-year-old child put through the same ordeal as Rochin? No one should
ever have to encounter the disasters that she has to, especially not a
teenager. This challenging position is bound to leave her scarred. As she has
already fought in several battles and acknowledges that, the experience will
stay with her for many years.</p>
<p>Rochin is a
well-trained sniper, known by her colleagues for her precision, but this does
nothing to reduce the pressure that she feels. She is disappointed that she has
the job of a sniper, for she is too young to be given such a demanding role. </p>
<p>One of her
greatest worries is being killed before her life has even begun. Even though
she is scared of death, she is also fearless and understands that she breaks ground
as a female soldier. She knows she is paving the way for other females to get
into battle and help to stem the spread of fear that is taking root in their
nation.</p>
<p>Women in her world
are usually seen as desperate, even as property, but she can show the entire
world that is not so, that she is strong, real and deserving. She keeps doing
her job for her family, with the hope that one day she will see them again. </p>

<p>“On the frontline of the war on terror, I found young
fighters, giving up their dreams and their lives to fight for a future without
war or terrorism. Of course, I have my doubts; is their story worth risking my
own safety over? The realization that they are fighting “our” war against the
Islamic State makes all the risks worth it. </p>
<p>I was raised in the Netherlands, a
wonderful and privileged country. It could have been otherwise for me. I was
born in Jakarta, in one of the city’s worst slums. Because I was adopted, I
understand that my life could have been different in so many ways from how it
is today. I feel compelled to tell the story of these people, and I do not
have the option to do it from a distance. They are fighting a war for us, in
conditions that most of us cannot really fathom. They deserve to be brought

</div></div>","TEENAGE DREAMS SHOT TO PIECES...

Logline: A Western video journalist travels to Iraq
and Syria to produce a personal documentary on the young, undersupplied Kurds
and the harsh realities of their battle against Al Qaeda and the Islamic State.
""""Our
world is a global community, where far more unites us, as human beings, than
divides us. We have to understand that 'the people over there' are no different
from us. Our
joys and sorrows are intrinsically linked, they are shared.""


Tagline: Fight young, die young.
TEENAGE DREAMS SHOT TO PIECES is an ambitious and daring 60-minute, unscripted documentary film - targeted to worldwide audiences - that takes a fresh and unprecedented look at the war against the Islamic State, with a slew of extraordinary, personal stories from selfless soldiers and one courageous, caring journalist.

By chronicling these powerful stories, this film provides an unparalleled opportunity to empower, engage, and enlighten worldwide audiences. The Islamic State - constantly spewing out an ideology of hatred, oppression, and murder – has become a global bane with widespread ramifications for an increasing number of people, wreaking havoc with unwarranted bloodshed tantamount to full-fledged war. 

What sets this documentary apart from the plethora of news stories surging out of the war against ISIL is that the footage and stories come straight from the front lines - of valiant fighters who are battling IS on the ground and at the grassroots level. The Islamic State has made it clear that it will not hesitate to kill aid workers, reporters, or prisoners of war in public and brutal ways. The constant state of paranoia has profoundly discouraged the reporters and filmmakers who were prepared to go out and get first-hand accounts. 

Freelance journalist and documentary maker, Bud, has witnessed the horrors of war first-hand. He shares his experiences with the world at large so that these anonymous and valiant soldiers have a face, and a voice. In this documentary, Bud will travel to both Iraq and Syria to contact the Kurdish boys and girls, some as young as 16, who battle the IS on our behalf. 



Bud will follow the soldiers around and capture their daily lives - constantly witnessing death and destruction in the process - to paint an intimate and realistic portrait of people who have no choice but to defend their family and their homes. He delves deeply into the young soldiers’ pasts, and their hopes for the future.
It has become increasingly difficult for major broadcasters and news agencies to cover Iraq and especially Syria. The kidnappings and continuing battles with the Islamic State make it almost impossible for journalists to travel to those countries. Many broadcasters and news agencies are, therefore, dependent on freelancers. These are often highly-motivated and idealistic people who put their lives on the line because they care. The job of freelance journalists in war zones is never without danger. The documentary follows such a journalist and finds out what inspires and motivates him to go to dangerous countries. When he meets the soldiers fighting this war, they discover they have something in common. As much as this documentary is about war and the fight against the Islamic State, it is also about dreams, devotion, and drive: things we can all identify with.

BUD WICHERS – THE JOURNALIST



Bud Wichers was born in Indonesia, in one of the most deprived slums of its capital, Jakarta. His biological mother and father saw such a gloomy future for him that they felt they had no other choice than to go through a hospital and orphanage to provide him with a better future, and Bud was adopted. My adoptive parents in Holland provided me the opportunity to improve myself and motivated me to become anything I wished."" Bud chose to become a reporter. Naturally curious, Bud always sought adventure. He is consistently attracted to global news, and has an interest in exposing the fact by discussing a good, sincere, and exciting tale.

Bud felt drawn to conflicts and disputes at an early age. Captivated by the stories of the Israelis and Palestinians, he first went to visit the Middle East during the Second Intifada.  He wanted to know more about the situation. There, he learned the value of life. This feeling is continuously leading him to travel to, witness and report on areas of high risk such as the frontline of disputes, where life is seemingly useless - yet it is important, and worth filming.

BERFIN - THE REFUGEE


This battle is deeply personal for 17-year-old Berfin. After the Islamic State pitilessly murdered her two brothers during an ambush at their school, she escaped, looking for refuge in Turkey with her mother. Could you imagine the hardships and disasters if you found yourself in this situation? Your brothers brutally murdered, your father gone, and then having to flee from your home, your country, in search of safety? This is what Berfin and her mother had to go through, to reach where they now stay in a refugee camp that is situated in the town of Suric.
She often awakens in the evening, sweating and trembling, her heart beating faster after thinking about the slaughter of her brothers. She does not think she will ever be able to come to terms with losing them, and wishes that she could have somehow been there and done more to save them. 
Berfin is a sympathetic and intelligent young girl. She wants to be able to help her mother, who suffers so much due to the war.  She struggles to cope and hold everything together for her mother's sake. She knows that she must overcome this to survive, but it is challenging. 

SAMAN - THE SOLDIER



Saman is 20 years old, but he is not your conventional 20-year-old. He has been tossed into a role, which many of us could not, or would not, dare to do.
Just how does it feel to be young, naïve and untroubled and then, in the blink of an eye, be in fear of your life and not have anyone to run to, or anywhere to seek refuge? You must fight; kill or be killed. 
As a soldier, his watchtower overlooks the small town. He is ultimately the one responsible for the protection of friends and families. He is no stranger to gunfights and the horrors of war, and although his shots are precise, his heart is not in it.
Since he became a member of the army, he has learned that both of his parents were murdered when Islamic State fighters ambushed his father’s cafe and brutally murdered everyone inside.
He dreams of returning to his home and becoming the successor of his father's pizzeria as an act of honoring and continuing his family’s tradition. However, his dream has become a hopeless whisper among the explosions since he joined the Kurdish army. 
Since the fighting started, this once happy and caring young man is transforming into a depressed and cynical person.
These memories are from a time before he joined the army, but now he often wonders if there is anything left worth fighting for. He is struggling daily, trying to find the will to continue fighting, and the hope that, one day, everything will be normal again. 



Rochin - The
Sniper  



Before she joined
with the JPG Kurdish, female military, 16-year-old Rochin was just a regular
college student. She was enjoying her life, like any teen anywhere. Her favorite
lessons were sociology and world history and, after class, she loved playing
with her siblings.

 
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
 

 
 
The
only distinction between Rochin and any other 16-year-old is that she is compelled
to keep her childhood behind. She must take up arms to secure the ones she
loves.
Can you imagine
your 16-year-old child put through the same ordeal as Rochin? No one should
ever have to encounter the disasters that she has to, especially not a
teenager. This challenging position is bound to leave her scarred. As she has
already fought in several battles and acknowledges that, the experience will
stay with her for many years.
Rochin is a
well-trained sniper, known by her colleagues for her precision, but this does
nothing to reduce the pressure that she feels. She is disappointed that she has
the job of a sniper, for she is too young to be given such a demanding role. 
One of her
greatest worries is being killed before her life has even begun. Even though
she is scared of death, she is also fearless and understands that she breaks ground
as a female soldier. She knows she is paving the way for other females to get
into battle and help to stem the spread of fear that is taking root in their
nation.
Women in her world
are usually seen as desperate, even as property, but she can show the entire
world that is not so, that she is strong, real and deserving. She keeps doing
her job for her family, with the hope that one day she will see them again. 
HELP THEM TELL THEIR STORY!

WHY THIS FILM IS IMPORTANT TO ME

(Bud was adopted as a child by a Dutch family.)
“On the frontline of the war on terror, I found young
fighters, giving up their dreams and their lives to fight for a future without
war or terrorism. Of course, I have my doubts; is their story worth risking my
own safety over? The realization that they are fighting “our” war against the
Islamic State makes all the risks worth it. 
I was raised in the Netherlands, a
wonderful and privileged country. It could have been otherwise for me. I was
born in Jakarta, in one of the city’s worst slums. Because I was adopted, I
understand that my life could have been different in so many ways from how it
is today. I feel compelled to tell the story of these people, and I do not
have the option to do it from a distance. They are fighting a war for us, in
conditions that most of us cannot really fathom. They deserve to be brought
into the world’s spotlight. 
I would like to give something back since I have
been given so many opportunities in life. In my documentary, Teenage Dreams
Shot to Pieces, you will meet these teens, get to know them, and get a glimpse
into their world. I hope you want to help me to make this film.”
HOW YOU CAN HELP?
Your generous funding will help me get things started in order to realize our film. It will assist me with the cost of further development. More importantly, you get the chance to be a part of this unique experience.
Where will your hard earned money go to?
How can we expect you to donate something, if I don't do my part? We want all your hard earned money to go to the story, so I've invested in video equipment. Your money will go to: travel expenses, security expenses, post-production costs and medical insurance.

<p>My name is David Toms, I am a filmmaker from Birmingham, UK.
</p><div>
<p>Everyone involved in this film <span>are
aspiring filmmakers, who are dreaming big and wanting to achieve something
outstanding. A couple of us went to University together and now several years on we are working on our next project, which is a short drama/triller.</span></p>
<p><span>Harry is left alone on his family's farm in a remote location following a world-changing event. Without his wife and son, he tries to make do with his own company and daily chores that sustain his well-being and life. - That is until Dylan runs from the forest and into his life. We explore their relationship and the difficulty in coming to terms with company after being alone.<br/>
<br/>The team's previous projects have gone on to be selected at film
festivals including the Pasadena International Film Festival in California as well as the
Green Bay Film Festival in Wisconsin, which was pretty amazing for us.</span></p>
<p><span>Along with film festivals, our last short was supported by the Kevin Spacey Foundation, which not only took us by surprise, but also helped us finish the film.<br/>
<br/>On to now though and the scope of the project is noticeably bigger and better than we have
done before, this is something we try to do increasingly with each project. We want to be able
to match our dream for the project with the reality. So this is why we need
your help. The bigger the budget we have, the better the resources available to
us, the higher the production value.<br/>
<br/>
A film like this takes months of planning and thought, from the obvious bits
like the script, to the more particular details like set and costume design. </span></p>
<p>We've made the lowest perk at a pound so even someone who
can’t afford much, can still chip in if they’d like to. But even if you could
spread the word, that is a huge help too. We think we have some great perks available, and we hope that we can send you a DVD when it's all done.</p>

<h3>Budget</h3>
<p></p>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The film needs £2200 to happen - this is a low budget
short film and that money will go towards creating high production values, not to mention actually paying our
cast and crew, which we believe is the right thing to do.</span>
<p>“Put the money on the screen"" is what most
filmmakers are told, so that is what we are trying to do. The films production
design is very important as we are dressing the set to look like it has been
lived in, without power for years. Candles, lots of candles...</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here is what our budget is made up of:</p>

<p>
We scoured the country for a farm with the right look and we found it a few
times, but more specifically, we found exactly what we wanted on a small farm
in rural Shropshire. A family run and owned business, they agreed to let us
invade their home for two days. They also agreed to let us pay a fraction of
what a normal production would. Seriously nice people. You can see the location
on our gallery tab, we think you'll agree it really does look fantastic. <br/>
<br/><b>
Cast and Crew</b></p>
<p><b><i><b><small>""If you're good at something, never do it for free""</small></b><small>- </small></i><small><i>The Joker, The Dark Knight (2008).</i></small></b></p>
<p>For those of you who aren't working in or reading up on independent filmmaking,
there has been a rather lengthy discussion lately between everyone - ""To
pay or not to pay"". Whilst the core production team are making this as a
labour of love, we can't fill every role and we certainly can't act! Thankfully
there are some talented groups of people, some who can produce cinematic
high-end results and some who are incredibly driven to give it all on camera.
One thing these people have in common though, is that they make a living doing
these incredible things. It's fair then, that we should pay them for helping us
to craft a great film and not expect a freebie. We've been there, many times,
but if we can help it, one less noticeable way that we can raise our game is to
do the professional and right thing. <br/></p>
<p><br/><b>
Equipment Hire</b><br/>
We are very passionate about filmmaking kit, that's why we want the best for
our latest outing. For the first time we will be utilising 4K video to enhance
not only the look of the film, but to bring us on level with many mainstream
productions. <br/>
<br/><b>
Props and Costumes</b><br/>
A film that is set after some world changing event, sure sounds expensive.
Thankfully we've become very used to stretching our pennies and making a little
look a lot. This film will be no different.<br/>
<br/><b>
Distribution</b><br/>

</div>","Our Story
My name is David Toms, I am a filmmaker from Birmingham, UK.

Everyone involved in this film are
aspiring filmmakers, who are dreaming big and wanting to achieve something
outstanding. A couple of us went to University together and now several years on we are working on our next project, which is a short drama/triller.
Harry is left alone on his family's farm in a remote location following a world-changing event. Without his wife and son, he tries to make do with his own company and daily chores that sustain his well-being and life. - That is until Dylan runs from the forest and into his life. We explore their relationship and the difficulty in coming to terms with company after being alone.
The team's previous projects have gone on to be selected at film
festivals including the Pasadena International Film Festival in California as well as the
Green Bay Film Festival in Wisconsin, which was pretty amazing for us.
Along with film festivals, our last short was supported by the Kevin Spacey Foundation, which not only took us by surprise, but also helped us finish the film.
On to now though and the scope of the project is noticeably bigger and better than we have
done before, this is something we try to do increasingly with each project. We want to be able
to match our dream for the project with the reality. So this is why we need
your help. The bigger the budget we have, the better the resources available to
us, the higher the production value.

A film like this takes months of planning and thought, from the obvious bits
like the script, to the more particular details like set and costume design. 
We've made the lowest perk at a pound so even someone who
can’t afford much, can still chip in if they’d like to. But even if you could
spread the word, that is a huge help too. We think we have some great perks available, and we hope that we can send you a DVD when it's all done.


Budget

The film needs £2200 to happen - this is a low budget
short film and that money will go towards creating high production values, not to mention actually paying our
cast and crew, which we believe is the right thing to do.
“Put the money on the screen"" is what most
filmmakers are told, so that is what we are trying to do. The films production
design is very important as we are dressing the set to look like it has been
lived in, without power for years. Candles, lots of candles...

Here is what our budget is made up of:




Location fees

We scoured the country for a farm with the right look and we found it a few
times, but more specifically, we found exactly what we wanted on a small farm
in rural Shropshire. A family run and owned business, they agreed to let us
invade their home for two days. They also agreed to let us pay a fraction of
what a normal production would. Seriously nice people. You can see the location
on our gallery tab, we think you'll agree it really does look fantastic. 

Cast and Crew
""If you're good at something, never do it for free""- The Joker, The Dark Knight (2008).
For those of you who aren't working in or reading up on independent filmmaking,
there has been a rather lengthy discussion lately between everyone - ""To
pay or not to pay"". Whilst the core production team are making this as a
labour of love, we can't fill every role and we certainly can't act! Thankfully
there are some talented groups of people, some who can produce cinematic
high-end results and some who are incredibly driven to give it all on camera.
One thing these people have in common though, is that they make a living doing
these incredible things. It's fair then, that we should pay them for helping us
to craft a great film and not expect a freebie. We've been there, many times,
but if we can help it, one less noticeable way that we can raise our game is to
do the professional and right thing. 

Equipment Hire
We are very passionate about filmmaking kit, that's why we want the best for
our latest outing. For the first time we will be utilising 4K video to enhance
not only the look of the film, but to bring us on level with many mainstream
productions. 

Props and Costumes
A film that is set after some world changing event, sure sounds expensive.
Thankfully we've become very used to stretching our pennies and making a little
look a lot. This film will be no different.

Distribution
How much do you think it costs to send a film off to a festival? The cost of
postage? Surprisingly, most festivals charge anything from five founds to 80
pounds just to look at your film. It is though, the only way of really getting
your film seen at the moment. We've had a taste of the festival circuit in
recent years and we'd like to make it a trend, not a fluke, with your help we
can.

</p>
<p>Hello! We are the production team behind the upcoming feature film <i>Drinking Games</i>, directed by Hayward Suggs. Our team is based just outside of Chicago, IL.  Since we were young, each of us have dreamed of writing, directing, and producing our own films. This is an opportunity for each of us to take a step in that direction. We are dedicated and passionate filmmakers who have been working tirelessly to bring this film to life. </p>
<p><i>Drinking Games</i> is a comedy/drama (dramedy, if you must) about four close friends who celebrate their annual tradition, The Beer Olympics, at a cabin in the woods. When two of the friends, Brian and Kyle, both admit to each other that they have feelings for their friend Liz, they decide to use the Beer Olympics as a chance to compete for her affection. As the games and the weekend progress, the two find increasingly sadistic ways to sabotage one another.</p>
<p>Our goal is to raise enough money to help our crew accomplish the endlessly challenging task of making a movie, and a good one at that. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>

Hello! We are the production team behind the upcoming feature film Drinking Games, directed by Hayward Suggs. Our team is based just outside of Chicago, IL.  Since we were young, each of us have dreamed of writing, directing, and producing our own films. This is an opportunity for each of us to take a step in that direction. We are dedicated and passionate filmmakers who have been working tirelessly to bring this film to life. 
Drinking Games is a comedy/drama (dramedy, if you must) about four close friends who celebrate their annual tradition, The Beer Olympics, at a cabin in the woods. When two of the friends, Brian and Kyle, both admit to each other that they have feelings for their friend Liz, they decide to use the Beer Olympics as a chance to compete for her affection. As the games and the weekend progress, the two find increasingly sadistic ways to sabotage one another.
Our goal is to raise enough money to help our crew accomplish the endlessly challenging task of making a movie, and a good one at that.    What We Need & What You Get 

After much deliberation and discussion, we came to the conclusion that we would be able to make the best movie possible with a budget of $10,000.
This money will be used to acquire film equipment, locations, hardware and software, food for our cast and crew, props, makeup, and other various expenses. If there's anything we've learned from working on other indie films in the past, its that the more money you have the more comfortable your shoot can be. Money not only affords us food and nice equipment, it also gives us the opportunity to do things on screen that we wouldn't be able to on a lower budget. Camera movements, soundtrack choices, quality sound (one of the most important things there is and apparently the hardest to get right), good performances ,etc. 
For your generous contributions, we are offering various perks, rewards, and services for select prices. Items include a finished copy of the film, a prop from the movie, a copy of the script signed by the cast and director, and other various prizes.
If we do not make our intended goal, the amount of money we make will be used for the essentials of our film like food and transportation to keep our cast and crew well nourished (to keep them working for free) and anything left over will be used on hardware and equipment expenses.
    The Impact 

Our producers attached to this film have worked on various films and projects that have given them the experience and knowledge to do the job. They have years of knowledge of film equipment, organizational skills, and people skills (seriously, this one is important) at their disposal.   
    Risks & Challenges

We know it won't be easy to make our goal, and we expect it to be a very trying task, but we feel confident in our script, our director, and our producers to do the job to the best of their ability. Whether we make the money or not, we will be filming Drinking Games this summer AND IT WILL BE GOOD.... but it will definitely be better if we make our budget.

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <ul> <li><p>After fifteen years, Audrey is forced to share the truth regarding the circumstances surrounding her teenage sons adoption, putting all that she's established at risk. </p></li>
<li><p>The idea for Market Value is derived from a news segment I was watching one evening about a same sex couple who were having difficulties adopting a child due to their sexual orientation. I don’t know if it was conveyed as lucidly, but it was safe to assume considering that the couple met all other adoption requirements. This wasn't my first time hearing a story such as this. <br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p></li>
<li><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">However, this particular segment caused me to consider how extremely arduous the adoption process must be for this couple. Beyond the normal requirements for legal adoption, they were clearly being challenged in their efforts to provide love and refuge to a child who had been neglected, which made absolutely no sense to me. Being a father of two, my first thought was, “what about the child?” Who’s considering what’s best for the child? So, I decided to write a story, not completely like the situation from the news segment, but one that would cause people to ask: what is most important when it comes to seeing that a child is well taken care of? And what price are you willing to pay to ensure their well-being?</span><br/></p></li>
<br/><li>By contributing to this project, you're not only playing a huge role in getting this film made, but you are giving independent filmmakers an opportunity to produce work outside the conventional Hollywood studio model. That is extremely important for filmmakers like myself who desire to tell stories that are human, and socially relevant without the fear of plummeting at the box office. Although we would love to be a huge success at the box office as well :-)!     <br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <ul> <li>We're asking for a total of $40,000 to get this film in the can. Your contributions will help cover the expense of: equipment, cast, crew, wardrobe, insurance, permits, locations, legal expenses, and transportation. If we don't reach our goal, we can still begin filming, however, we won't be able to complete it without cutting corners, and I refuse to cut corners - this is hard work. Too many of us compromise the integrity of our work to get films made, so please help us produce the finest product we can possibly make with our budget.</li>
<li>Check out our PERKS!<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>To what extent would you go to save the life of a child? This story highlights the importance of a strong family unit, whether it be traditional or non-traditional. And despite the films battle between ethics and legalities, it is not a political
film, but allows viewers of all social and political persuasions to weigh in
with their own perspectives. This film also deals with issues regarding LGBT adoption, same-sex marriage 
and human trafficking. But at the heart of the film, LOVE is the theme.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> Anyone who has made a film knows how difficult the process can be. There can be many set backs even after obtaining a budget. There's lots of risk involved, and very little to gain most times. Many times the reward is just actually completing the project entirely. <br/></p>
<p>However, this project is nearly two years in the making, which has allowed us more than enough time to plan properly. As mentioned in the video, a portion of the budget has already been raised. In fact, we've raised enough to start filming right away, but unfortunately we wouldn't have enough to finish, which is one of the existing pitfalls when budgets aren't suitably put together. That is why we are requesting the amount of $40K - to comfortably secure and solidify the essential needs of our project.  <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span></p>

</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4196826/?ref_=rvi_tt"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i><u>Hands to the Sky</u></i></a>, a documentary that turns a lens
on deejays, musicians, fans and the feelings inspired by the experience of
house music dance-parties.  House music
was born out of the inner-city underground clubs of the late 1970s, music that
still influence the latest dance music offerings of today.  House Music conveys raw and emotional
expressions of love, pride, acceptance and unity-layered over its signature
funky 4 by 4 beat.  House music strikes a
universal chord among its fiercely loyal fans who can be found the world
over-of any age, of any race, of any demographics.  Over a two-year period, the filmmakers
followed this music out of the clubs, house parties and into the parks and
beaches where an estimated 100,000 house music fans gather to dance, commune
and rejoice in the summer heat.  From
Coney Island to Fort Greene Park to various public spaces in and around New
York City, Hands to the Sky interviews dancers, event promoters, deejays and
performers who share personal, often poignant anecdotes and recollections of
how house music in general, and these outdoor functions specifically, have
shaped their world-views, established lasting relationships and inspired dreams
and aspirations. </p>

</p><div>
</div><p>Are you a “Club Kid” at heart?  Would you like to know how it all started?  Check out our new documentary; “Hands to the
Sky”.   We need funds to finish and distribute this
compelling new documentary about house music and dance culture. </p><div>
</div><p>In today’s film distribution climate, it has been established
that independent film projects struggle to break even or simply incur heavy
financial losses using the strategies based on the traditional distribution
paradigm.  Due to the film industry’s
organic shift to a digital landscape with high-definition and
ultra-high-definition platforms coming within the New Year—in addition to the
increasing modification of “Day and Date” windows—it has become more cost efficient
for independent film projects to take
advantage of these platforms and strategies. 
The goal here would be to establish an industry presence and exposure for
the <i>Hands To The Sky</i> with the
intention to sell content directly to consumers globally through digital
platforms.  </p><p>
</p><p>The film is nearly finish—we are at the home stretch—if we
can’t come up with the finishing funds and digital distribution cost for the
major digital platforms (Netflix, Amazon Prime, iTunes, CinemaNow, Vudu, etc.),
there will be no other cost effective
way to reach our audience for this independent film.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1265014/files/20150303093745-digital_distribution_video_1_.png?1425404265"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div>
</div><p>This approach will allow indie filmmakers like ourselves;
get this special film to the fans of the dance music culture all over the
world. </p><div>
</div><p>
</p><p>The film is about 90% finished; we only need a little

Hands to the Sky, a documentary that turns a lens
on deejays, musicians, fans and the feelings inspired by the experience of
house music dance-parties.  House music
was born out of the inner-city underground clubs of the late 1970s, music that
still influence the latest dance music offerings of today.  House Music conveys raw and emotional
expressions of love, pride, acceptance and unity-layered over its signature
funky 4 by 4 beat.  House music strikes a
universal chord among its fiercely loyal fans who can be found the world
over-of any age, of any race, of any demographics.  Over a two-year period, the filmmakers
followed this music out of the clubs, house parties and into the parks and
beaches where an estimated 100,000 house music fans gather to dance, commune
and rejoice in the summer heat.  From
Coney Island to Fort Greene Park to various public spaces in and around New
York City, Hands to the Sky interviews dancers, event promoters, deejays and
performers who share personal, often poignant anecdotes and recollections of
how house music in general, and these outdoor functions specifically, have
shaped their world-views, established lasting relationships and inspired dreams
and aspirations.

   What We Need & What You Get 

Are you a “Club Kid” at heart?  Would you like to know how it all started?  Check out our new documentary; “Hands to the
Sky”.   We need funds to finish and distribute this
compelling new documentary about house music and dance culture. 
In today’s film distribution climate, it has been established
that independent film projects struggle to break even or simply incur heavy
financial losses using the strategies based on the traditional distribution
paradigm.  Due to the film industry’s
organic shift to a digital landscape with high-definition and
ultra-high-definition platforms coming within the New Year—in addition to the
increasing modification of “Day and Date” windows—it has become more cost efficient
for independent film projects to take
advantage of these platforms and strategies. 
The goal here would be to establish an industry presence and exposure for
the Hands To The Sky with the
intention to sell content directly to consumers globally through digital
platforms.  
The film is nearly finish—we are at the home stretch—if we
can’t come up with the finishing funds and digital distribution cost for the
major digital platforms (Netflix, Amazon Prime, iTunes, CinemaNow, Vudu, etc.),
there will be no other cost effective
way to reach our audience for this independent film.
This approach will allow indie filmmakers like ourselves;
get this special film to the fans of the dance music culture all over the
world. 

The film is about 90% finished; we only need a little
help to take this unique film to the next level:

<span>Joe is an awkward cubicle-dweller whose days consist of paperwork and coffee runs for his big shot boss, Ace. In case the name didn't give it away, Ace is a grade A douche-bag. Joe, however, is captivated by his boss's glamor and success. With a mid-life crisis hitting full force, Joe questions his self-worth. <br/><br/></span><blockquote>
<span>""Who do you want to run with, Joe? The wolves? Or the sheep?"" - Ace Morgan</span><br/><span></span>
</blockquote>
<span></span>Inspired, Joe decides that he must become a big shot! The next day, he arrives at work stylin' in a crisp suit. He ""walks the walk and talks the talk"", trying to take charge of his life.  Little does he know that his co-workers think he looks like an idiot. They quickly resent him for being like Ace, who is <i>actually</i> the office bully. <br/>Jiminy Crocket (... see what we did there?) is Joe's eccentric friend and Ace's #1 victim. He feels betrayed by Joe. <br/> <br/><span>A moment of self-discovery occurs when Joe is forced to make a life-changing decision: follow in Ace's footsteps... or stand up for Jiminy.</span><br/><br/><h2>

I am originally from Rhode Island and came to Columbia College Chicago 
to escape small town suburbia. I have always loved editing and have had 
several years experience working with advanced production films. When I get the footage, I work to assemble the director’s 
vision and tell a great story.
 I love having the ability to put
 together and manipulate footage like a puzzle.

I am the Casting Director for Mr. Big shot. I'm very outgoing and 
passionate about filmmaking. I really like to tell stories about every 
day life (that everyone can relate to), but with a hint of comedy and 
romance because I believe that this is how life should be.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Gregoria es una señora española de 63 años, tímida, introvertida y seria, que vive prácticamente encerrada en su casa junto
a su esposo Francisco, un personaje controlador. A víspera de la fiesta que organiza para su esposo, Gregoria conoce a una peculiar costurera, Tania. Es una mujer brasileña de 60 años,
divertida, regia y vibrante que cada fin de semana pone a bailar a más de uno
con su show de Celia Cruz. Gracias a la nueva amistad, Tania le propone a Gregoria superar todos sus miedos
para hacer posible su felicidad y descubrir como disfrutar de la libertad. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Este cortometraje elogia la
libertad, los deseos de gozar y la búsqueda de la felicidad. Propone una visión
del mundo y de la vida libre de prejuicios, temores, amenazas y miedos.<br/></p>

<p>Gregoria is a Spanish 63 year old lady, shy,
introvert and serious, who lives practically locked in her house besides
Francisco, her husband who is a control freak. On a party organized by her
husband, Gregoria meets Tania, a peculiar needlewoman. She is a 60 year old
Brazilian, funny, regal and vibrating, who each weekend, makes dance more than
one, with her Celia Cruz’s show. This new friendship will be the reason why
Tania proposes Gregoria to overcome all her fears to make possible her
happiness and discover how to enjoy freedom.</p>
<p>This short praises freedom, the desires of
enjoying and the happiness search. It proposes a world point of view and a life
free of prejudices, fears, and threats. </p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">El
maltrato psicológico que se ejerce contra la mujer es invisible y está normalizado. Si deseamos mantener una sociedad en la que sea posible la convivencia y la resolución de conflictos de
modo pacífico tendremos que promover todo tipo de acciones preventivas que
vayan dirigidas a la eliminación de los estereotipos y roles de género.</p>

Este
pensamiento me lleva a crear la historia de dos mujeres mayores que se conocen
y emprenden una relación de amistad, dos mujeres muy distintas pero con gran
fuerza en su interior para luchar y lograr 
superar cualquier obstáculo. </div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">

<p>This thought led
me to create a story of two older women who begin a friendly relationship, two

a su esposo Francisco, un personaje controlador. A víspera de la fiesta que organiza para su esposo, Gregoria conoce a una peculiar costurera, Tania. Es una mujer brasileña de 60 años,
divertida, regia y vibrante que cada fin de semana pone a bailar a más de uno
con su show de Celia Cruz. Gracias a la nueva amistad, Tania le propone a Gregoria superar todos sus miedos
para hacer posible su felicidad y descubrir como disfrutar de la libertad. 
Este cortometraje elogia la
libertad, los deseos de gozar y la búsqueda de la felicidad. Propone una visión
del mundo y de la vida libre de prejuicios, temores, amenazas y miedos.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Gregoria is a Spanish 63 year old lady, shy,
introvert and serious, who lives practically locked in her house besides
Francisco, her husband who is a control freak. On a party organized by her
husband, Gregoria meets Tania, a peculiar needlewoman. She is a 60 year old
Brazilian, funny, regal and vibrating, who each weekend, makes dance more than
one, with her Celia Cruz’s show. This new friendship will be the reason why
Tania proposes Gregoria to overcome all her fears to make possible her
happiness and discover how to enjoy freedom.
This short praises freedom, the desires of
enjoying and the happiness search. It proposes a world point of view and a life
free of prejudices, fears, and threats. 








El
maltrato psicológico que se ejerce contra la mujer es invisible y está normalizado. Si deseamos mantener una sociedad en la que sea posible la convivencia y la resolución de conflictos de
modo pacífico tendremos que promover todo tipo de acciones preventivas que
vayan dirigidas a la eliminación de los estereotipos y roles de género.

Este
pensamiento me lleva a crear la historia de dos mujeres mayores que se conocen
y emprenden una relación de amistad, dos mujeres muy distintas pero con gran
fuerza en su interior para luchar y lograr 
superar cualquier obstáculo. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The emotional
abuse is against women is invisible and standardized. If we wish to maintain a
society where living and the resolution of conflicts is possible through
pacifist ways, we must promote all kinds of preventive actions that are focused
on eliminating stereotypes and gender roles. 

This thought led
me to create a story of two older women who begin a friendly relationship, two
women very different but with a strong sense of will to fight and overcome any
obstacle.

<h1>INTRODUCTION : </h1>
<p>What does the term left behind stand for? Left behind children are children whose parents had to go to the cities to work and make their end meet, while leaving their loved ones in the villages which usually results in 5-10 year old children cooking for themselves, washing their own clothes and doing daily works that otherwise would be done by the grown-ups. With more than <b>61 million Left Behind Children in China</b>, which is almost equivalent to the population of United Kingdom, it is a real issue which should get more attention. </p>

With all the horror icons that he came to know and love being remade, re-imagined and spoofed. He made it his goal to create a horror icon for a new generation. At the time being a newbie in film, he knew he needed to look for help. That's when he met Ketrick Copeland. Ketrick explained to Eric that he needed a great story. He encouraged Eric to start writing as soon as possible, so Eric spent 2009 to 2010 writing the first draft of Blackmere Harvest. When Eric showed the script to Ketrick, he didn't get the response he had hoped. Ketrick said the villain and horror elements were on point, but it needed work. This is when Ketrick introduced Eric to Sandy Bucy, a seasoned amazing writer who helped Eric take Blackmere to the next level. 
From 2010 to mid-2010, Sandy and Eric worked on revamping the story, characters and Blackmere world. By 2011, the script was done, while the two were all still doing a variety of other projects, they started shopping the script around. Ketrick and Eric went from small studio to small studio, not getting the reception they wanted. They kept hearing the same thing, the script did not fit the typical Hollywood horror tropes. One of the biggest elements of Blackmere Harvest is that it stars a 90% ethnic cast, with the goal of not being stereotypical or cheesy. 
In 2012, Eric fell victim to one of the worst civilian Massacres in American History in Aurora Colorado Century 16 Movie Theater. Being in the theater parallel to the main crime scene, many bullets came through the wall striking more victims rising the count of the injured. Coming out of this, just about took his heart for film as he was there to watch a film. The physiological road back to normal was a treacherous and long one. With being called a hero for helping people, to the media bombarding him at home with calls, to portions of the online community trying to tear his name apart with conspiracy theories. Eric ended up moving to Houston, Texas for a fresh start for himself and his family.
 In Houston, Eric met a up and coming director, actor, and writer by the name of Malcolm Carter. Already in school for film, Malcolm was making short films and web series building his skills up. From the moment they met, Eric knew he was the kind of guy he needed to partner up with. Together they created Final Line Entertainment, together they built a great team of people inspired to make films and work their way to the top.  In 2015, Sandy reached out expressing very exciting news about how they had a decent named director wanting to take helm on Blackmere. Sadly, this never amounted to a film. The same thing happened two more times leaving them back to square one in a sense. 
Eric sat back and looked at the great team they built in Houston and all the people that are really connected working for the same success. That's when Eric realized, together they could make this film happen themselves and of course with the help of the crowd funding community!</p><p><br/></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474670302/wRITER_AND_DIRECTOR_ERIC_HUNTER_brproz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Through hypnosis the listener goes in a state of deep relaxation in which the heart rate, blood pressure and breathing rate decrease.

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Recent research from around the world has shown that the more distress a woman reports prior to infertility treatment, the less likely she is to conceive ( Philip Quinn DR and Michael Pawson MB BS FRCOG ""<i>Psychosomatic Infertility"" European Journal of Clinical Hypnosis</i> Volume 4). There are a number of things that could possibly be
hindering your ability to bear a child – and not all of them are physical. Thus, in order to both improve the quality of her life, as well as to optimise the chances of treatment success, hypnosis techniques are an excellent complement to standard infertility treatment.  In fact, studies show that 50% of women who were hypnotised during IVF treatments successfully became pregnant.

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">In my own practice, I tend to see women after they have hit rock bottom. Some of them have endured years on end of heart-breaking negative birth tests, devastating miscarriages, failed IVF cycles and endless doctors’ appointments that have done nothing to change their situation. They lie awake worrying about the chance of never having a baby, crying for days after hearing of a friend's pregnancy, second-guessing every step of their treatment, wondering about the ability of their marriage to withstand this crisis and so, so much more.</span></p>

Aside from studying engineering and business, we both share a passion for film making. Throughout our high school years we have tampered with video editing on YouTube for countless hours. From YouTube we have been teaching ourselves about every aspect surrounding film making, from video editing to sound design. We've made many different test videos, video series and even done some paid work for clients, however we have yet to display our full potential. We can’t just sit here and wait for an opportunity to pop up, we have to get up and make an opportunity for ourselves. That's when we realized that by making a film we could compile everything we knew into one big production and showcase our skills. Ideas are amazing and all but at the end of the day there is no such thing as a free lunch, in our case a movie. Of course we’re not jumping into a multi-million dollar Michael bay Hollywood style picture, we are trying to go as low budget as possible without looking low budget at all.</span><br/></p>
<p>          The idea for this movie came to us one night when we were talking about a short deep web story from YouTube. We were thinking how awesome it would be if someone made a short film about the story. Then as we were discussing how we would do it, ideas started flowing like crazy and we bought some notebooks and started filling them up with our ideas. Eventually we came up with a solid script.</p>
<p>          We have been working hard in order to come up with funds to shoot this project. We had set a budget of $5000 without including some equipment we already had. Since this January have been working tirelessly in order to come up with the money. So far we have come up with $3500 and the shooting date is approaching very quickly, which will be this July. This is where you guys come in. We would use the money to help pay for actors and props. We are doing all of the editing, visual effects and stunt work ourselves. This way we can cut costs, plus we can control how the final product looks from the inside out. Any extra money that will be made will go to increasing our production value with better equipment and scenes.</p>

<p>A Hair Repair From Out Of This World!</p>
<p>Are you tired of hair that lacks shine and feels dehydrated? LRM is the solution to your problems. When you get your hair colored it opens the cuticle layer of your hair, after two or three weeks if not using the right professional salon product, this causes you to lose your shine. LRM closes the cuticle layer quickly and keeps it closed longer than other products on the market and therefore gives you a longer lasting shine and maintaining you hair color for much longer. LRM has been designed with 30 years of experience in the salon industry. A lot of thought has gone into LRM and it has 3 purposes in one bottle. You can use LRM as a repair mask, regular conditioner and a leave in conditioner. No more of having to buy 3 separate bottles now you can buy just one. Do your hair a favor and take advantage of this Indiegogo campaign and  get a bottle of LRM today at half of the cost!</p>
<ul>
<li>A revolutionary blend of high quality ingredients and science<br/>enabled us to create: DDF ""Delayed Deployment Factor""</li>
<li>LRM keeps working for about 24 hours after rinse out.</li>
<li>11 Different Roots Extracts as Natural Ingredients</li>
<li>LRM restores moisture and can bring back dull, over stressed hair and even stop hair breakage.</li>
<li>After first use, hair feels stronger and healthier and the <br/>relationship is only getting better from there.</li>
<li>Get ready to leave your regular conditioning treatment,<br/>hot oil treatments, etc. abandoned and forgotten.</li>
<li>No animal testing</li>
<li>No Aliens were harmed</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><br/>The first 950 investors who support this Indigogo crowdfunding<br/>campaign will receive this product at no additional<br/>cost (except shipping) plus many more benefits!</p>
<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>My name is Philippe Schaedler and I have been in the hair and beauty industry for over 3 decades.  Many years of working behind the chair, in the US and internationally, has given me the knowledge to know precisely what kind of products would be beneficial for those individuals with dry, colored or chemically stressed hair.  LRM is the result of the latest technology in product development with some of the finest and purest natural ingredients available today.  LRM can be used as a regular conditioner, as an intensive hair repair treatment, as well as a leave-in conditioner.  It can even stop hair breakage from chemical over processing.  LRM is a very unique product that will make a lot of women very happy because their hair will be happy!  During our 6 months trial period, each model was ecstatic about the lasting benefits of using LRM.</p>
<p>I have always been very passionate about my industry and the innovative products it offers, however, oftentimes, I discover a great hair product and then it ends up discontinued, much to my dismay!</p>
<p>So in 2013, I set out to make my own product because this way I have control over keeping it on the market and never have to worry about a sufficient replacement or substitute product.  And best of all, I have put all my knowledge over the past 3 decades into my product formulation with the help of some very knowledgeable and highly creative chemists…. and the end result was the creation of LRM.</p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign, you will help me create a product line that is free of animal testing and has 11 different root extracts as natural ingredients and has much longer lasting benefits than any other product on the market today. Plus, with each purchase, you make the world a better place knowing that I am committed to donating funds and supporting Best Friends Animal Sanctuary and Sojourn - a battered women's shelter in Santa Monica, California.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>My video will explain in more detail how, when, and why.</p>
<p>There are a lot of unique perks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proud feeling of being a founding member.</li>
<li>One 7.4 oz Lunar Repair Module</li>
<li>One year of LRM supply at 50% off the retail price (Limited to 6 Tubes)</li>
<li>Lifetime 10% discount on all LRM purchases.</li>
<li>For the first three years, with your participation and a successful campaign, we will donate 2% of all LRM sales to “Best Friends Animal Sanctuary” in Utah, and “Sojourn,"" a<br/>Battered Women’s Shelter in Santa Monica, California.</li>
<li>If the 100% goal is not reached, I will look for the remaining gap financing elsewhere.</li>
</ul>
<ul><li><strong>The Impact</strong></li></ul>
<ul>
<li>You participation will help create a revolutionary hair repair product, second to none.</li>
<li>A successful campaign will create donations to ""Best Friends Animal Sanctuary"" in Kanab, Utah, and ""Sojourn,"" Battered Women Shelter in Santa Monica, California.</li>
<li>The production of LRM will pave the way to four more equally unique hair products.</li>
<li>You will make a lot of women very happy because their hair will be happy!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Contributing to an Indiegogo campaign is not the same thing as making a purchase in a store. By contributing to a campaign you are supporting an idea, project, or cause you care about. One of the amazing parts of crowdfunding is pitching in and helping ideas you'd like to see come to life! It's very rewarding to see projects that you fund go from idea phase, to seeing the stages of its development, and (if all goes according to plan) see the project be successful.</p>
<p>It's important to know that you are not buying an existing product.</p>
<p>My contribution to this project so far is approximately $ 6,800.- Dollars + 4,000 hours.  That investment enabled me to come this current point of the development stage of my project.</p>
<p>This has allowed me to overcome the biggest risks and challenges that I was facing at that time. I purposely did not want to hit the ""Launch Button"" until all large risk factors were eliminated. One being, the complex process of the Acquisition of Lunar Proterozoic Anorthosite, and finding the right laboratory who knew how to creatively work an ""Anorthosite Fusion / Liquifaction"" into my existing formula.</p>
<p><strong>Important for you to know:</strong></p>
<p>If the fundraising goal is not reached, I will do either of two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find Gap financing elsewhere.</li>
<li>Refund the money to each contributor.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you cannot contribute, you can still help this project in a big way: Spread The Word About This Campaign! Tell your friends on Social Media, because there will be many among them who will greatly benefit from the existence of LRM.</li>
<li>To make it easy, please use the Indiegogo share tools!</li>

For the first three years, with your participation and a successful campaign, we will donate 2% of all LRM sales to “Best Friends Animal Sanctuary” in Utah, and “Sojourn,"" aBattered Women’s Shelter in Santa Monica, California.
If the 100% goal is not reached, I will look for the remaining gap financing elsewhere.

The Impact

You participation will help create a revolutionary hair repair product, second to none.
A successful campaign will create donations to ""Best Friends Animal Sanctuary"" in Kanab, Utah, and ""Sojourn,"" Battered Women Shelter in Santa Monica, California.
The production of LRM will pave the way to four more equally unique hair products.
You will make a lot of women very happy because their hair will be happy!

Risks & Challenges
Contributing to an Indiegogo campaign is not the same thing as making a purchase in a store. By contributing to a campaign you are supporting an idea, project, or cause you care about. One of the amazing parts of crowdfunding is pitching in and helping ideas you'd like to see come to life! It's very rewarding to see projects that you fund go from idea phase, to seeing the stages of its development, and (if all goes according to plan) see the project be successful.
It's important to know that you are not buying an existing product.
My contribution to this project so far is approximately $ 6,800.- Dollars + 4,000 hours.  That investment enabled me to come this current point of the development stage of my project.
This has allowed me to overcome the biggest risks and challenges that I was facing at that time. I purposely did not want to hit the ""Launch Button"" until all large risk factors were eliminated. One being, the complex process of the Acquisition of Lunar Proterozoic Anorthosite, and finding the right laboratory who knew how to creatively work an ""Anorthosite Fusion / Liquifaction"" into my existing formula.
Important for you to know:
If the fundraising goal is not reached, I will do either of two things:

Find Gap financing elsewhere.
Refund the money to each contributor.

 
Other Ways You Can Help

If you cannot contribute, you can still help this project in a big way: Spread The Word About This Campaign! Tell your friends on Social Media, because there will be many among them who will greatly benefit from the existence of LRM.

<p><b>""The Alone""</b> means everything to us!!! We are gamers and <b>""The Alone""</b> is the horror game we have always wanted to play. <b>""The Alone""</b> is the game that starts all of our future games. To us, this game's success brings the possibility of so much more. First, the success of this great game and more great games to come. Second, the growth of our companies into something that will allow us to change this industry for the better. Third, so our families can eat and we can afford to pay our rent. Seriously!!!! I mean we love video games and that's why we got into this field. I, Julien McGregor, have 5 daughters..... they need to eat and my savings account is running dry (not to mention Gamer's Studios 16 other employees!). <br/></p>

GAMER'S STUDIOS & CATMAC ENTERTAINMENT
Gamer's Studios is a company founded on the principle ""By GAMERS for GAMERS""  and that is why we, at Gamer's Studios, want to give you the best game possible. Over a year ago, we started a journey to make a survival/horror game that blends the old with the new.  By combining what we love about our favorite horror genre games, and legends of monsters and demons from around the world, we will truly make a game unlike any other. But how do we do this, we asked? Well we sat down and brain stormed.... and we came up with 3 key ingredients in making an amazing game. 1. A great story! 2.  A wonderful  cast, crew, and creative team, and finally 3.  Belief that you will help to make this the best game ever!



We teamed up with long time Producer and Casting Director Catrine McGregor owner of CatMac Entertainment. Catrine has been working in the film, video and gaming industry for 40 years, and has won three Codie Awards (the gaming equivalent of the Oscar) for her work on  the acclaimed Tex Murphy series, which includes Tesla Effect, Tex Murphy: Overseer, The Pandora Directive,  and Under a Killing Moon. She has also produced and cast over 400 films and TV series such as Poolhall
Junkies, Cover Me: Based on the True Life of an FBI Family, 3 of a Kind,  Halloween 5,
and  Firestarter. 

WHAT ""THE ALONE"" MEANS TO US.
""The Alone"" means everything to us!!! We are gamers and ""The Alone"" is the horror game we have always wanted to play. ""The Alone"" is the game that starts all of our future games. To us, this game's success brings the possibility of so much more. First, the success of this great game and more great games to come. Second, the growth of our companies into something that will allow us to change this industry for the better. Third, so our families can eat and we can afford to pay our rent. Seriously!!!! I mean we love video games and that's why we got into this field. I, Julien McGregor, have 5 daughters..... they need to eat and my savings account is running dry (not to mention Gamer's Studios 16 other employees!). 



WHAT YOU ARE HELPING US ACHIEVE.
You are helping us achieve something that is more than your average video game, you are helping us achieve a dream - a dream to make video games that redefine what it means to be a Gamer. You are helping to make something which will submerse you into a whole new world  of terror and suspense. Isn't that why you play games?  To go someplace else and live a whole new experience? If so, join us on this adventure and be a part of ""The Team."" Together we can make ""The Alone"" become a reality.  
WHAT WE NEED.

We need $350,000 to get ""The Alone"" produced! It takes substantial funding to create a game with amazing visuals, a great script - crew costs, actors, and hardware.  With our team and our combined know-how, we can bring ""The Alone"" to life for less than a large company with high overhead costs.  This is where YOU come in. With your contributions, we will be bring this game to life. Let me break down our plan of action so you can see where the money is going.


THE BREAKDOWN.
We want to share with  you our business plan. Remember when we talked about how we discovered how to make an amazing game with three key ingredients? Well, let's break them down:1. A GREAT STORYHaving a great story is key when you are making a video game. It's what draws us in and holds our attention. ""The Alone"" combines myths from Japanese/  Okinawan beliefs along with western demonology beliefs. When we add our amazing story, we get ""The Alone.""


2. A WONDERFUL CAST, CREW, AND CREATIVE TEAM!
Let's start  with our cast:DAVID H. STEVENS:David H. Stevens is an actor that will take your breath away. We at Gamer's Studios are truly proud to have him on board as the lead character of our game, as you saw in our teaser. Also we are also proud of his recent success as Jesse James in the AMC mini series ""The American West."" See clips and learn more about David at davidhstevensactor.com.

DON SHANKS:

Don Shanks is known far and wide for his role as Michael Myers in Halloween 5, Nakoma, in Grizzly Adams, and The Fisherman, in I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer. Also known for his excellent work as a stunt man, we are thrilled to have such a well known horror movie icon involved in our project.JANET LO:
Janet Lo is no newbie in the film industry and her amazing creativity in her life is what drew us to this actress. You might have seen her in such films as Pay The Ghost, Diary of the Dead, and To Die For, or on television on MADtv, Cracked, or The Border. Currently, besides being involved in ""The Alone,"" she is producing and starring in a play called ""Madam Mao,"" the story of chairman Mao's wife. It's a must see!!!JULIEN McGREGOR:Julien McGregor is no stranger to the film world and is the owner of Gamer's Studios. Working his way up the film ladder, he is now working on two video game projects and  is producing ""Vision"", a short that will be in Crypticon's film festival next year. Julien spends time with his wife and five adorable daughters, while juggling a company and doing independent film contract work. Not only has he worked in the film industry for almost 10 years, he was raised in the industry, shadowing his Mother and now business partner, Catrine McGregor. They have teamed up to make a game unlike any other.   CATRINE McGREGOR:
As you saw earlier on her reel,  Catrine McGregor is one seasoned veteran in the film industry and we are proud to have her on board. With her knowledge of the film and video game industry she will take "" The Alone"" to a whole new level. TOM SANFORD:

Tom is an award-winning Independent Film Director and has joined the team to co-direct  and co-produce ""The Alone"" with Julien McGregor. Tom Sanford is a valued member of the team and there is truly no better creative combination than Tom and Julien. ""The Alone"" will have an amazing look that will blow other games out of the water.

DAVID BRACKETT:

David Brackett isn't just our line producer, he was a long-time coder and programmer for HP and Micron. David also worked for the DOD and Air Force, running joint force operations overseas. If there is anyone who understands what it takes to lead a project, it is him. 

TREY STIMPSON:

He may look young, but Trey Stimpson is a talented animator and one of the creative heads of ""The Alone."" The creation of the monsters in this game is largely credited to Trey. With his tireless efforts and amazing work, Mr. Stimpson is living proof of what it takes to be dedicated to a project. Trey is a newlywed, with a child on the way. Without Trey, we would not be here today.


SEAN DAHLMAN:

When you think of the mood of a game, you usually turn to music. That is why we turned to Sean Dahlman. Sean is the man when it comes to music. We are thrilled with the mood his track brings to our teaser.Dahlman is a classically trained composer and musician and brings an incredible body of work to ""The Alone.""THE REST OF THE  CREW:
There are so many people who have helped us get to this point on  ""The Alone."" We wish to acknowledge and thank Josh Decime, Andrew Klosterman, Jeremy Brown, Nyk Fry, Conner Talbot, Danyale Cook, Ashley Ashcraft, Brandy Hunter, Krystle Lake, Ben Anderson, Ashton Jenicek, Carter Burenheide, Easton Lay and Micheal Becker.
3. BELIEVE!!!!!
We truly believe this game will be amazing and ask you to BELIEVE with us! We want you, THE GAMER, to play ""The Alone"" and feel like you have played an EXCELLENT game and crave the excitement for our next release.
THE BUDGET
We want to be transparent!!! Here is where your money is going, and why. PLEASE NOTE that a  SALES and MARKETING PLAN is in play, with negotiations underway. Without the SALES, the fun and excitement of playing ""The Alone"" can not be shared worldwide!




1, Let's talk about the crew, for which we have a budget of $162,000 USD.   They will be paid as contractors, except for a few full time employees. 2.

""We, The Survivors"" is a FEATURE film, that follows Corporal Lincoln Hunt, who returns home after his final tour in Iraq, only to realise that for some... the war is never really over.

Linc struggles to come to terms with his Combat PTSD, (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder), as he tries to re-calibrate back into his civilian life. Although he is physically back home with his wife Elisha and 9 year old daughter Lila... He isn't 'really' home. The horrific flashbacks and silent screams in his head finally become to much to bare, and after an emotional confrontation, Linc snaps and attacks Elisha and Lila.

Scared out of their minds they leave and seek solace with Jack, Elisha's father; who is also an ex Vietnam Vet.Jack loves Linc like his own son, but more-so he understands him in a way that only another soldier could. Linc is tired of living as an empty vessel of his former self, and want's to 'LIVE' not just 'EXIST', and after an emotional exchange of words, Linc breaks down and realises that he can't get passed the PTSD on his own; and better yet he doesn't have to, he accepts responsibility for his actions at war (good or bad, whatever they may be), and finally opens himself up to receiving help and treatment.

<div><br/></div>
<div>This campaign is to raise money for Sophistiglam LLC, the Production company with heart and soul. The donations will go toward the purchase of camera and set equipment and operating expenses, all of which has been borrowed or rented thus far. </div>
<div>I have lived to tell people's remarkable stories, either through the lens or with a microphone. When I sit down to an interview, my eyes are wide open and ears are ready to receive the blessing of information from the presence in the opposite chair. As a producer who is constantly seeking wisdom and ways to visually translate the message through universal content, I have dedicated my career to reaching  toward the women in this world that are living out their purposes, despite overcoming insurmountable odds.</div>

<h3>The Struggle is Real</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<p>At age 35, I decided to switch industries. I went from being a lead producer for a nationally syndicated radio show (The Tom Joyner Morning Show) to work in television. I left a steady bi-weekly paycheck to seek the unknown. Because I followed my instinct, I landed in the right apartment in the right neighborhood and within a year, I was working with the right people. Then in 2014, I had to have a serious surgery and I could only work freelance gigs in short distances. You can only guess how things changed financially after that. After nearly 2 years of living on God's grace and glory, I had decided to take matters into my own hands - no longer relentlessly applying for jobs and waiting for someone to hire me, but creating the work and the clientele myself. I have the faith, the intelligence (that Spelman College degree) and the curiosity to create the life I've dreamed. <b>That dream WILL come true</b>. </p>
<br/>
</div>

<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">So, we're in Los Angeles where hundreds of production teams and individuals compete for the same business. I'm looking forward to traveling to reach out for more work, but keep our home base here in La La land.

<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>

</div></div>","The Dream (what I know for sure)

This campaign is to raise money for Sophistiglam LLC, the Production company with heart and soul. The donations will go toward the purchase of camera and set equipment and operating expenses, all of which has been borrowed or rented thus far. 
I have lived to tell people's remarkable stories, either through the lens or with a microphone. When I sit down to an interview, my eyes are wide open and ears are ready to receive the blessing of information from the presence in the opposite chair. As a producer who is constantly seeking wisdom and ways to visually translate the message through universal content, I have dedicated my career to reaching  toward the women in this world that are living out their purposes, despite overcoming insurmountable odds.
After years of connecting and waiting, my crew and I are currently on standby for a call from the White House to interview Michelle Obama. Need I say more? 

Ok, just a little....






THE FUTURE - I'm looking toward focusing my attention on highlighting philanthropic organizations, the women who turn the world - including single moms and teachers, and survivors of domestic violence and abuse over the next 2-3 years. I hope to one day have a philanthropic arm of Sophistiglam LLC, with programs benefiting women and children. 



The Struggle is Real

At age 35, I decided to switch industries. I went from being a lead producer for a nationally syndicated radio show (The Tom Joyner Morning Show) to work in television. I left a steady bi-weekly paycheck to seek the unknown. Because I followed my instinct, I landed in the right apartment in the right neighborhood and within a year, I was working with the right people. Then in 2014, I had to have a serious surgery and I could only work freelance gigs in short distances. You can only guess how things changed financially after that. After nearly 2 years of living on God's grace and glory, I had decided to take matters into my own hands - no longer relentlessly applying for jobs and waiting for someone to hire me, but creating the work and the clientele myself. I have the faith, the intelligence (that Spelman College degree) and the curiosity to create the life I've dreamed. That dream WILL come true. 


The Ask (what we need)

So, we're in Los Angeles where hundreds of production teams and individuals compete for the same business. I'm looking forward to traveling to reach out for more work, but keep our home base here in La La land. I've been networking like crazy and while it's paying off, the cash flow needs to increase and I am still operating at a loss. 

Monies are needed for:

- Filming equipment (Canon and Sony DSLR/4K Cameras, RED rentals, crane rental, mics, boom, monitors, drone, etc.)

- Travel, transportation and food (the goal is to one day afford union crews). This is to also meet with out-of-state talent and be available to work as a local hire in other cities 

- General operating expenses (production salaries, work/studio space, keeping the lights on and the landlord happy - and because no one should have to work for free)

- Post-production, licensing and clearances

- Registration fees for Minority Business Certification


With unwavering faith, I will continue this pursuit. But, I need your help! 



The Work (all about)

Throughout my career I've interviewed stars like Jerry Seinfeld and George Wallace to Phylicia Rashad, Tyler Perry, Kristin Bell, Kevin Hart, Denzel Washington and the list goes on. I have hours of exclusive interviews, both on-camera and recorded of many artists and entertainers, countless film casts and many national civic leaders. I'm so thankful for each opportunity. 

The focus continues with: 

- Digital Content for businesses and organizations (including the little pizza stand on the corner who can't afford thousands of dollars for a full crew and setup). 

- TV pilot/Film production

- Voiceovers 

I've gathered lots of contacts and built solid PR relationships and now it's time to put those to good use on my own entertainment brand with integrity. 

The Perks: 

Aside from huge prayers of thanks and paying it forward, 

- The top 2 contributors will receive Executive Producer credit on the next 2 major projects under Soulglo Productions. This includes any major interviews.


- Those contributing $500 or more will receive a customized, personal HD video thank you with their name (or company name) and/or logo visible. This video will be distributed via social media on as many platforms as possible. 

- For contributions over $350, Soulglo Productions will send you a free inspirational social media video for you to post with a note of thanks for your contribution. You will also received special mention on any public occasions. 

Anyone contributing to this campaign will be featured in the credits of the next full-length project under Soulglo Productions.

Chloe a recent dumpee and Bex a recent dumper, they choose to deal with their break ups in very different ways. Whilst Chloe seeks comfort in girlfriends, candlelit baths and balancing her Chakras, Bex thinks the best way over it is to ‘swipe right’.Thrown into this car crash are lecherous landlord Harry, wind up merchant Sally and a string of disastrous and inappropriate sex. Despite their repelling magnetism the girls do manage to get ‘over it’ and a real friendship grows with hilarious consequences.  Over It (full details)Teaser ScenePlease enjoy the teaser scene below, taken from Episode Three

 
After (another) one night stand, Bex is dragged to yoga by Chloe. Suitably unimpressed, Bex thinks Chloe could be spending her time elsewhere...Why Fund it?Sisters are doing it for themselves.The statistics for female written and directed comedy is pathetically low. Directors UK recently published a report on gender and between 2011 and 2012 only 8% of comedy and entertainment programmes in the UK were directed by women. 8%!Rather than wait for the industry to ‘take our calls’  we are just going to get on with it and get it done.  This production has two female leads,  has been written by women and is going to be Directed, Produced and Edited by women. Here’s your chance to be part of readdressing the balance.TimelinePre-production has already happened and we are ready to shoot Episode One in mid October, post production in November ready to air in December.  Writing, casting, locations and crew are all ready to go we just need you! Where your money goes: The CreatorsJess Collett and Gabriella Parsons met through Ewa ‘Own Your Shit’ Kolodziejska’s class at The Actor’s Centre in 2014.They played opposite each other in Neil LaBute’s two-hander ‘Good Luck (In Farsi)’ at the Hen & Chickens Theatre last October.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">We are Terrence Chan and Ross Henry, co-host and producer of the Two Plus Two Pokercast, and we are creating an independent audio documentary about the $270000 fight between poker pros Juan Carlos “JC” Alvarado and Olivier Busquet. The story of Alvarado and Busquet’s fight is a fascinating one. Both men have no formal experience in mixed martial arts, but agreed back in November 2015 to train for an MMA fight in April 2016. With just these six months training, they have both dropped their lives, faced their fears, and dedicated everything towards this monumental climax.</span></p></li>
<li><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">We’ll explore their backgrounds, their fears, their triumphs as they go on this journey. We’ll capture the sound and atmosphere of the fight itself, talk to the key players and navigate the listener through the insanity of this big-money fight between two complete novices of the fight game.</span></p></li>
<li><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">We'll capture the full audio experience before, during, and after the fight, including interviews with the fighters, teammates, coaches and friends.</span></p></li> <li>

</ul> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>In more detail:</p> <ul> <li>Although we are covering this event for the love of the story, we have incurred and continue to incur significant costs (hardware, server space, travel expenses, research, production, editing) and intend to spend hundreds of hours in the creation of this audio documentary.

Two high rollers who fight with their wits now fight with their fists. 

For a quarter million dollars.
Summary

We are Terrence Chan and Ross Henry, co-host and producer of the Two Plus Two Pokercast, and we are creating an independent audio documentary about the $270000 fight between poker pros Juan Carlos “JC” Alvarado and Olivier Busquet. The story of Alvarado and Busquet’s fight is a fascinating one. Both men have no formal experience in mixed martial arts, but agreed back in November 2015 to train for an MMA fight in April 2016. With just these six months training, they have both dropped their lives, faced their fears, and dedicated everything towards this monumental climax.
We’ll explore their backgrounds, their fears, their triumphs as they go on this journey. We’ll capture the sound and atmosphere of the fight itself, talk to the key players and navigate the listener through the insanity of this big-money fight between two complete novices of the fight game.
We'll capture the full audio experience before, during, and after the fight, including interviews with the fighters, teammates, coaches and friends. 
We appreciate any contributions and all will help us to reach our process and end goals more completely.  

   What We Need & What You Get In more detail:  Although we are covering this event for the love of the story, we have incurred and continue to incur significant costs (hardware, server space, travel expenses, research, production, editing) and intend to spend hundreds of hours in the creation of this audio documentary. We are hoping to offset these costs with the donations of people interested in making our work a reality.
 We are offering unique perks for donations; have a look!  If we don't reach our entire goal, all funds contributed will still go towards the costs of production and distribution. If we over achieve, we will invest contributions towards future series.     The Impact More about our campaign and what your contribution will mean:  Your contribution will allow our production team the ability to dedicate their time to creating a high-quality audio documentary for listeners. 
As tremendous fans of the podcast and audio medium, we aspire to produce a high-quality narrative complete with the production values, script, high calibre interviews and the feel of the podcasts and audio stories which inspire us.

We hope to provide value and bring exposure to both the poker and mixed martial arts communities. We hope to inspire participation, interest, understanding, and appreciation.

<p>Kristina Paltén, a 45-year old Swedish runner, became the first lone woman ever to run across Iran (1144 miles) on 2nd of November 2015. </p>
<p>Kristina, with her two world records in both 12-hours and 48-hours running on a treadmill, chose Iran for her run for three main reasons. The beautiful nature, the long distance and her own prejudices against the country and its people.<br/><br/>She wanted to explore a, to her, unknown country upon which she only had the western media coverage to rely on to understand.<br/><br/>During two months Kristina therefore challenged her own fears for the unknown and her own prejudices about what a muslim country means for a lone woman running 1144 miles.<br/><br/>- Today I feel like “muslim” has become synonymous with ""terrorist"" or ""fundamentalist"". There are around 1,5 billion muslims around the world today, and I'm guessing most of them are really nice. With this run I want to question my own prejudices, learn more about a culture I know little about and meet a lot of people. I hope my run will contribute to more openness, trust and tolerance both within myself but also in the world, says Kristina.<br/><br/>We have followed Kristina since she came up with the idea, ran through Iran and since she came back to Sweden. During her 58 days on the road our local cameraman was with her for a total of 8 days to make sure Kristina truly was alone during her run. Much of the film is therefore based on Kristina's own footage making the film incredibly intimate, honest and touching. </p>

It will then be available for private and small community screenings while we also start to pitch it to TV-channels around the world. (2 TV-channels have already contacted us and shown interest in showing the film)

<div>An adopted African-American named Lewis Clark, falls in love with a young woman named Lisa Adams, who is the victim of a magical curse. The curse causes Lisa to transform into 5 different races, Caucasian, Indian, Chinese, Hispanic, and African-American. Lewis and Lisa struggle with their relationship as Lisa continuously changes skin color, and the two of them explore their own opinions about race and how much it really matters in their relationship.</div> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What Inspired this Film?</h3>
<div>
<i>""All I ever wanted was to be like one of those people in the movies. I have always dreamed of saving the world from aliens, or riding dinosaurs, or being a superhero. My friends and family always told me that I was crazy for dreaming that because I'm not a famous white actor. Being an Indian filmmaker in America, I have often had to accept the fact that people of my race are not taken seriously in the American film industry. However, being an Indian born-and-raised in America, I have also had to accept the fact that some films I want to make, such as sci-fi or fantasy films, might not be taken seriously in the Indian film industry. I have grown-up in two different worlds, and yet I am not truly a part of either of them. So I wanted to make a film that shows that it doesn't matter what race you are or how you are raised. You have the potential to do whatever you want and be whoever you want and you don't have to justify it to anyone. I may not be white and I may not be famous, but I, and people like me, still deserve to make movies."" </i>
