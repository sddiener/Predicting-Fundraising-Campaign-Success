<p><b>Now enters E²-kWh</b> with its proprietary combination of
components. We at SunGroup Energy have addressed all your problems and
concerns; by designing and building power units that <b>uses no combustible
fuels</b>, scald your hands, or are loud. You don’t need sun or wind. They will
not burn or catch fire. You don’t need ridiculously tall towers, or tons of
space with rivers flowing through your property. <b>So what makes us
unique?</b></p>
<p>Our <b>digitally
operated controllers using an on Demand approach </b>leverages rpm’s and
torque through variable speed. By utilizing built in timers we give you the
versatility to customize required power output for individual home needs. So
with the<b>push of a button you can make more or less power whenever you desire</b>.</p>
<p>For example, If you
need 1kWh per hour it will be built and priced for that need, if you need 10kWh
per hour then it will be built and priced for your need. The point is whatever
your power needs <b>we can make it happen.</b></p>
<p>By using our
proprietary blend of Hybrid components including but not limited to, diodes,
rectifiers, charge controllers, inverters, internal and external disconnects,
system meters, along with dump and overcurrent protectors. Components that are
ul listed are under certification 1741. <b>We are giving you versatility,
cost effective, danger free, reliable</b>, on or off the grid power. Systems
include proper balance of systems equipment, and will meet electrical safety
criteria. </p><p><br/></p><h2>What does it look like?</h2><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe border=""0"" height=""326"" src=""https://media.embed.ly/1/frame?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DyexaGmlvDpg&amp;width=580&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;height=326&amp;secure=true"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>

</p><p><b><span>This is the Prototype
that proves all my theories work.</span></b> The unit is producing 1812 watts per 60 minutes being fed
right into my home. This unit is consuming 300 of the watts its making,
to <b>sustain itself. </b>giving an <b>actual net profit wattage
of 1512.</b> </p>
<p><b>As you can see, with
this unit here we can achieve real power with no consumables. </b>This prototype is
an example of general mechanics, but this does not reflect what the final build
will look like. Keep in mind I have been building and changing these for over 5
years in spare time, with spare money. From hydraulics to a parallel bearing
model, our new kWh, 5th generation combines the very best of methods and
technology. The final model will be a lot cleaner, newer, and customizable. We will keep you updated with the changes in look as we go along. </p>

Hi my name is Kris
Giles. I am the Owner and CEO of SunGroup Energy, We are in the business of
power production. I realized early on that people in the 21st centurywant
to be energy independent for a variety of different reasons, whether it is
Environmental Impact, saving money, or just pure independence. We crave
sustainable energy.Here is a video that goes into most of this story that you will read down below. Watch it to get a better understanding of our project. 
We at SunGroup Energy
have been working on E²-kWh prototypes for over 5 years. We are currently on
our 5th generation platform. We have cranked up about 1 new version every
year, with the scrap funds we were able to scrape together. Now we are
100% confident in our final design to be able to offer it to all of you.
We have in the past built two
prototype power units to run a home or business.   These units
need no consumables in energy production: such as sun, wind,
water, gasoline, propane, natural gas or oil.   They used a reclaiming
process and operated off 1 gallon of hydraulic fluid.   Both units cut
the power bills by 30% at both test sites. Our new Units can supply an unlimited amount of power. 
Take a look at the
full video of our first generation of this unit. (note we don’t use half of
these components now), I was sharing this video with my partner Matthew
Chiapetta. Let's watch it together!Oh man, I am almost
ashamed to see this video again. But hey you have to start somewhere. This was
my first prototype to stop paying the power company, and be independent from
the grid so my family didn't have to suffer with no air conditioning or TV.
Sadly since I never intended on offering this unit to others, I didn't shoot
video of the other prototypes. But we do have some footage of the current
prototype on down the page. 
Once I finally got it
right, I wanted to share with you (and the world) this
technology, so that you do not have to go through the headache of doing
this yourself. 
The current
generation being introduced uses no fluids.  Is also 99% maintenance
free.   We have found a way to harness vs (variable speed), and by
regulating torque, along with rpm's, we can rectify and condition produced
power to 120v or 240v at 60 hz. The unit can be used on grid or off
grid.   Based on our proposed cost divided by output for a 8 year period,
1 kwh will cost you 1/2 a cent.   That is .12 cents a day for

Here is why Solar

for why wind is not a good source of production in general. Now you might ask well
what about hydropower, we have been doing that for a long time. Well there are
certain conditions that hydropower needs. Lets take a look. Now you say ""Ok
you got me I don't have a river by my house with a large hydro unit that costs
a ton of money...but I do have a generator! What about that?"" Well I do
have some thoughts about generators, and as a parent of three kids, this idea
worries me. Here is why.So that is the reason
most of these methods are not really feasible. 
Plus they are really
expensive, and to me the costs outweigh the benefits. How does this invention work? 
Now enters E²-kWh with its proprietary combination of
components. We at SunGroup Energy have addressed all your problems and
concerns; by designing and building power units that uses no combustible
fuels, scald your hands, or are loud. You don’t need sun or wind. They will
not burn or catch fire. You don’t need ridiculously tall towers, or tons of
space with rivers flowing through your property. So what makes us
unique?
Our digitally
operated controllers using an on Demand approach leverages rpm’s and
torque through variable speed. By utilizing built in timers we give you the
versatility to customize required power output for individual home needs. So
with thepush of a button you can make more or less power whenever you desire.
For example, If you
need 1kWh per hour it will be built and priced for that need, if you need 10kWh
per hour then it will be built and priced for your need. The point is whatever
your power needs we can make it happen.
By using our
proprietary blend of Hybrid components including but not limited to, diodes,
rectifiers, charge controllers, inverters, internal and external disconnects,
system meters, along with dump and overcurrent protectors. Components that are
ul listed are under certification 1741. We are giving you versatility,
cost effective, danger free, reliable, on or off the grid power. Systems
include proper balance of systems equipment, and will meet electrical safety
criteria. What does it look like?

This is the Prototype
that proves all my theories work. The unit is producing 1812 watts per 60 minutes being fed
right into my home. This unit is consuming 300 of the watts its making,
to sustain itself. giving an actual net profit wattage
of 1512. 
As you can see, with
this unit here we can achieve real power with no consumables. This prototype is
an example of general mechanics, but this does not reflect what the final build
will look like. Keep in mind I have been building and changing these for over 5
years in spare time, with spare money. From hydraulics to a parallel bearing
model, our new kWh, 5th generation combines the very best of methods and
technology. The final model will be a lot cleaner, newer, and customizable. We will keep you updated with the changes in look as we go along. 
Imagine what we can
achieve together with
the proper equipment! 
Here are some
component pictures, to get an idea of the technological idea and design of the
5th generation production unit.This an example of the variable speed and pushbutton controlRPM and Torque Precision GearboxPower InverterBattery Pack
This is a simple Tony
Stark linear drawing of our main generation process. So as you can see with the
readily available components, and this design, we will turn ""Mark I""
into mark ""Mark V"" with your help.WE NEED YOUR HELP!
In order for us to
bring this unique unit to life and into your home we have to have your
help. In 2013, there is a lot of talk about clean energy in this country from companies that spend over 300 billion dollars to develop products that still produce harmful emissions, endanger our environment, wildlife and still use consumables. I do not enjoy watching all the ""commercials"" about clean energy on TV, and knowing what I know, it makes me even more ambitious. I want to get this unit into your homes as soon as possible. It is our endeavour to completely eliminate our dependence on fossil fuels, and truly clean up our environment for our future generations.
Our initial pledge
amount of $250,000, will enable us to
utilize resources and modify Engineering, they will enable us to buy and set up
needed machines for production assembly. We need to secure a larger space
during our setup period. This will enable us the ability to manufacture E²kWh on a large scale,
and we will have the resources and space to buy and produce components
needed to manufacture the units on a production scale. We will
be hiring additional personnel, including but not limited to factory
workers, packers, shippers, etc. 
Finally as proud
Americans, we promise to only manufacture the units in America, and use
American workers.
STRETCH GOAL!
If we surpass our needed
pledge amount, we will have the ability to do further research and
development into different energy alternatives to popular items we use every
day, including your boats and cars. We will be able to secure an even
larger space, and hire more personnel. We are striving to manufacture
all components at our facilities, currently that is not possible because other
suppliers have stuff we can use, and it is really expensive to buy the
machines, and presses to make the components. We want to make our own
custom components across the board, and you can help make that happen.
Since we are one of you, we want
every average person in the world to be able to afford our products. We
are estimating our products to cost dramatically less than any alternative
options available today. Your contributions above and beyond
our minimum pledge will enable us make this possible. We cannot
do this without your help.
REWARDS! What is in this for You?
We have a variety of rewards for
you when you pledge to support us. We have wristbands,
stickers, t-shirts, phone cases, a poster, and other incentives.You can call yourself an E²
kWh Supporter based upon what level you decide to back us on, you can
henceforth be known as a (for example) a TerraWatt level backer. It is fun, we
took the time to find a fun way to name them, so be proud of your level.Here are the Back on T-shirt design for Most Supporters. These will also be the Sticker Design. We are offering a few limited edition T-shirts for the Megawatt level backersHere is my favourite one, the first Limited Edition Zombie Apocalypse Ready Design.And for the people who are like us and prepare for worst case scenarios, and power outages, we have the second Limited Edition TEOTWAWKI (The End Of The World As We Know It) Design.Depending on what you get for the T-Shirt we will give you the option of one of the three designs for the Iphone/Galaxy Phone Cases.Also we are giving away discounts on the product once we are ready for retail selling. At the highest Tier we are guaranteeing you a fully functional unit, that you can install at your site. Your Impact on the WorldWith this unique one of a kind project we will be helping people no longer be at the mercy of the power companies, no longer will we sit and go why don't we have any power? And most importantly these units will not break a bank! I have been running my Pool Company business for over 10 years, and the number one question I get asked a lot is how can this save me on my power bill? So I know first hand what people are seeking, how to deliver the most cost effective equipment into their homes, and now soon I will be able to offer a whole new solution to not even worry about asking that question. Aren't you excited? Other Ways YOU can help!Even if you cannot contribute even the smallest amount, please pass this on to your friends and collegues, let them decide if they want to be part of the revolution. They will probably be glad you did. :)Feel free to use the Indiegogo share tools!We are really excited about this project, and I cannot wait till you are part of the energy revolution.

<p>Lulla's unique patent pending design was inspired by research on kangaroo care, the effects of heartbeat and breathing sounds, and the effects that smell, sight and touch have on babies and small children.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Hear</strong>- When the chest is pressed, Lulla plays a <em><span>real-life</span></em> recording of the breathing and heartbeat of a mother at rest. Her name is Gudrun, she is a dear friend, a mother of four and a Kundalini yoga teacher.</p>
<p><strong>Look</strong>- Babies prefer to look at something that resembles a human face. The colors of the doll were chosen for the purpose of making the doll gender and race neutral.</p>
<p><strong>Touch</strong>- The outer layer is made from soft <em><span>natural cotton.</span></em> The filling is made from ultra fine microfiber that is <em>hypoallergenic</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Smell</strong>- The fabric of the doll can absorb smell from parents if they first keep it close to their skin before giving it to their child for extra feeling of security.</p>
<p><strong>Clean and safe</strong>- The doll is machine washable in warm water making it safer for small babies with underdeveloped immune and respiratory systems.</p>

<h3>Why Lulla?</h3>
<p>There can be many reasons and situations when it is simply not possible for parents to keep their little ones close. Some babies take frequent naps, go to sleep early in the evening and it´s not safe for some people to co-sleep with their babies. There are also more serious reasons like illness and hospitalization of parents and babies, and last but not least, sometimes we just need a little break and a good nights sleep.</p>
<p>The Lulla doll imitates closeness with its soft touch and soothing sounds, so when parents have to be away for whatever reason, their babies can still experience the positive benefits of closeness.</p>

The purpose of most other sleep related toys is to help babies fall asleep with the help of white noise, sometimes resembling womb sounds. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">The Lulla doll, on the other hand, is designed to help babies stay asleep for longer periods at a time, and help babies stabilize and feel safe. The doll is imitating closeness to another person, more than trying to replicate the womb experience. The doll aims to do this with its unique real life sound that plays for 8 hours.

Lulla doll imitates closeness with its soft natural touch and by playing a real-life recording of the breathing and heartbeat of a mother at rest. Lulla's aim is to help babies stabilize their own breathing and heartbeat, resulting in longer and better quality sleep as well as added security. 
 

 
 
 
Lulla's unique patent pending design was inspired by research on kangaroo care, the effects of heartbeat and breathing sounds, and the effects that smell, sight and touch have on babies and small children.
 
Hear- When the chest is pressed, Lulla plays a real-life recording of the breathing and heartbeat of a mother at rest. Her name is Gudrun, she is a dear friend, a mother of four and a Kundalini yoga teacher.
Look- Babies prefer to look at something that resembles a human face. The colors of the doll were chosen for the purpose of making the doll gender and race neutral.
Touch- The outer layer is made from soft natural cotton. The filling is made from ultra fine microfiber that is hypoallergenic.
Smell- The fabric of the doll can absorb smell from parents if they first keep it close to their skin before giving it to their child for extra feeling of security.
Clean and safe- The doll is machine washable in warm water making it safer for small babies with underdeveloped immune and respiratory systems.

Why Lulla?
There can be many reasons and situations when it is simply not possible for parents to keep their little ones close. Some babies take frequent naps, go to sleep early in the evening and it´s not safe for some people to co-sleep with their babies. There are also more serious reasons like illness and hospitalization of parents and babies, and last but not least, sometimes we just need a little break and a good nights sleep.
The Lulla doll imitates closeness with its soft touch and soothing sounds, so when parents have to be away for whatever reason, their babies can still experience the positive benefits of closeness.
 
 

 
What do parents say?

""Our little boy never had problems falling asleep but had trouble sleeping alone. He woke up frequently during the night and his naps during the day were short. The Lulla Doll has helped him a lot, he slept for longer at a time which made it easier for the whole family to rest. For that mom and dad are truly grateful.“ 
- father of 7 month old Ólafur, Iceland
 
 
""Our experience of the Lulla Doll was very positive. Our daughter was born prematurely and she has slept with the doll by her side more or less the first months of her life. It gave her, and us, a feeling of safety and comfort“ 
- mother of 5 month old Bryndís, Iceland
 
 
""My children have had a hard time falling asleep on their own. Lulla helps them fall asleep and also stay asleep, giving their tired mother a long wanted break.“ 
- mother of 3 year old Ísgerður and 6 month old Eyþór, Iceland
""I cannot rate Lulla enough. My one year old was waking every 40 mins even with co-sleeping and I was at my wits end and crippled with exhaustion. I purchased Lulla as a last resort thinking that we had absolutely no hope. On the first night in her cot she woke twice and the second and third night we had a baby that slept through the night. I feel like a human again thank you so much for bringing this into my life.""
– Nikki, Australia
 
""I took a chance and bought the Lulla doll. I had heard such amazing reviews and though I had nothing to lose! My 17 month old sons constant waking was sending us mad! We have had Lulla for two weeks and he has slept though almost every night, settling himself when he wakes. It´s been amazing!""
 – Amber, Australia
""Just to say thank you so much for your great invention. Not only does my son love it, but it has the added benefit that when the Lulla doll is on, my husband does not snore! I´ve tested it a few times an as soon as I switch the doll on he stops snoring. It´s a miracle! We all sleep better, so thank you two times. ""
– Jessica, Denmark

 

 
Awards & Grants
The doll has been in development and testing for 3 years. It has received awards for both innovation and design. We have also been blessed with numerous grants.

 
Q & A - about the Lulla Doll

How is the Lulla doll different from other soothing plush sound machines?Both the purpose and the design of the Lulla doll differs from other seemingly similar products. The purpose of most other sleep related toys is to help babies fall asleep with the help of white noise, sometimes resembling womb sounds. The Lulla doll, on the other hand, is designed to help babies stay asleep for longer periods at a time, and help babies stabilize and feel safe. The doll is imitating closeness to another person, more than trying to replicate the womb experience. The doll aims to do this with its unique real life sound that plays for 8 hours. Other products only stay on for 15-45 minutes (or are movement activated), the sound file is not this large and the sounds are usually not real-life.What is the recommended age for the Lulla doll?The Lulla doll is suitable from birth. We recommend it for age 0-24 months when closeness is vitally important to a child´s early development and sleeping routine.Would you recommend it for toddlers?We know that many parents let their toddlers use the doll as well and they loved it. Toddlers can face many sleep related challenges like newborns. However, just of a different kind. Like switching to a bigger bed, sleeping in their own room, sleeping outside of the home overnight, and going to daycare. In these cases the Lulla doll can help to make them feel calmer and safer.    Is the doll safe for newborns?The Lulla doll has been thoroughly safety tested to be suitable for newborns. The whole design is with safety in mind. The doll is very light, made from natural materials, has no loose items nor toxic chemicals. However, it is not recommended to have loose items in a crib with a sleeping newborn. We strongly recommend that from birth to 12 months the doll is kept away from their face and not loose in the crib during sleep. The doll has Velcro fasteners so you can attach the doll to most cribs, strollers and other carriers.How long can I leave my child unattended with the doll?The doll is not a babysitter and we do not recommend that you leave your child unattended for extended periods of time. Human touch, attention and affection should always be number one, the doll is thought of as a second best when needed.Why is it not sound activated?Many sleep- toys are sound activated with the purpose of helping babies fall back asleep if they wake up during the night. We, on the other hand, want to help babies keep sleeping and not to wake up as frequently. The aim is also to help them keep their heartbeat and breathing more stable during sleep. This is achieved by having the sound on continuously.Is the Lulla doll machine washable?Yes, it can be washed at 40 degrees celsius. The soundbox has to be removed prior to washing which is easily done as it is placed in a velcro pocket on the back of the doll.How long do the batteries last?The Lulla doll comes with batteries that last up to 80-120 hours of playtime. We recommend that they be replaced with rechargeable batteries for better usage. That is also more eco-friendly, which we are all for!Q & A- about pre ordersWhen will the dolls be delivered?We are in our second round of production as sales far exceeded our expectations after our successful crowdfunding campaign. This production is due to be delivered in June of 2016. Do I have to have Paypal to buy?No, you can also pay with credit card. Do you ship to anywhere?Yes, global shipping is available!

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h3><strong>My background</strong></h3>
<p>I am a Mechanical Design Engineer with over 15 years of extensive manufacturing and product development experience. Also, my experience consist of conceptual design, machine design, packaging, injection molding, and Project Management.</p>
<h3>Why this campaign is important to me</h3>
<p>My passion was derived from a deep connection for my parents who are very dear to me. During the product inception, my parents were at a point in their life where they no longer could bath themselves properly. After realizing how important it was for them to be able to bath themselves without any assistance, I immediately knew I had to design and develop a product to meet their needs. In the process, not knowing at the time, that thousands of individuals with similar and other issues, would benefit from me developing this product. The reality of loosing such a basic ability, of being able to care for their personal hygiene was devastating to my parents, who had been independent all of their life. They finally allowed me to give them baths, but was still very uncomfortable with my doing so. Well, my parents died before they got a chance to see or use this patented product that I developed. My parent’s death made me more determine to finishing the development and manufacturing of the product for others with similar issues. You and I working together can help thousands or millions of people around the world in giving them a sense of independence in bathing themselves, which unfortunately my parents never got that opportunity. The elderly, person with limited range of motion, obesity and diabetes are real concerns and I am happy to know that I am playing a major role in helping to make many lives better. It gives me great pleasure to think that the product I have developed could be instrumental in saving someone from having a foot amputation or maybe saving a life. Because the facts are, after two amputations the average person does not live more than five years.</p>
<h3>What contributors will help me achieve</h3>
<p>I desire to raise funds to purchase inventory and market the product to make it available for everyone having limited range of motion and other health related issues. Your contribution will enable us to reach a wide audience by marketing this product on DRTV, social media, hospitals, doctors, nursing homes, etc. Currently we have little inventory and need funds to purchase parts and market the product. The funds will strictly be used for this purpose only. Your contribution will help us make this product available to millions of people. I am sure you know of someone who has a need for this product. Most people who have limited range of motion, have difficulties reaching to clean their lower extremities. Persons who are diabetic, need to inspect their feet every day for sores or ulcers.  Also, the product will help facilitate people with multiple sclerosis who have problems standing on one foot to wash underneath the other foot. This product can also help individuals who have hip, knee and back problems as well as obese individuals. Our product will benefit returning Veterans who have war time injuries to their back or lower extremities. Some veterans are also diabetic.</p>
<h3>                                      Returning Veterans</h3>

<h2>                                         Diabetes  </h2>
<p><strong>Will you help me to prevent this from occuring?</strong> you can by simply supporting my cause. After two amputations the average person does not live more than 5 years.</p>

<p>Foot ulcers are sores on the feet that can involve just the skin’s surface or can develop into more serious wounds, possibly leading to the loss of a limb. People with chronic conditions, such as <a href=""http://www.everydayhealth.com/diabetes/index.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">diabetes</a>, are particularly susceptible to foot ulcers. In fact, about 15 percent (over 4 million nation wide) of all people with <a href=""http://www.everydayhealth.com/foot-health/get-the-facts-on-foot-ulcers.aspx"" id=""_GPLITA_1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""text-decoration: underline;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by Text-Enhance"">diabetes</a> will develop a foot ulcer at some point in their lives. Practicing good foot care can put the brakes on foot ulcers before they start.</p>
<p>Looking carefully at your feet each day, including between the toes is extremely inportant. If you cannot do this yourself, you should get someone else to do it for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Looking at your feet is particularly important if you have reduced sensation in your feet, as you may not notice anything wrong at first until you look.</li>
<li>having a mirror to monitor your feet each day is extremly inportant for (cut, bruise, blister, redness or bleeding)</li>
<li>Use an aparatus for moisturising oil or applying cream for dry skin to prevent cracking.</li>
<li>Look out for athlete's foot (a common minor skin infection). It causes flaky skin and cracks between the toes, which can become a sore and than infected. If you get athlete's foot, it should be treated with an antifungal cream.                                   </li>

<p>The Centers for Disease Control recently released its <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/Features/VitalSigns/AdultObesity/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Vital Signs report</a> on adult obesity, based on a telephone survey of 400,000 people, and the numbers were undeniably alarming. According to the report, about 2.4 million more adults were obese in 2009 than in 2007. In fact, more than 72 million U.S. adults—or 26.7 percent—are now obese. This is an epidemic in America among adults and children. Of the many statistics about childhood obesity, one in particular highlights the urgency of the problem: One of every three children in America is now considered overweight or obese, and childhood obesity has more than tripled in the past 30 years. As this number continue to climb there are going to be some health issues associated, like type 2 diabetes. Being able to monitor and cleanse areas of your body is going to be an issue with some overweight or obese person. Managing good hygiene is going to be a real concern for some who can’t reach their lower extremities because of being overweight or obese.</p>
<h3>What and Why we need the funds for this campaign</h3>
<p>I want to raise $165K dollars that will help with marketing needed for DRTV, Internet marketing and purchasing inventory. Your contribution will change so many lives throughout the world. Therefore we would encourage you to contribute in some way. The funds donated for this worthy cause will make a major impact by providing individuals with a better quality of life. It is my passion and full commitment in getting this product into the hands of thousands of individuals that can benefit from its usage. I have been focused on this project for a few years and I am totally committed, because of the needs that so many people have.  We have built a relationship with the VA hospitals and other non profit organizations in helping those individuals with health issues. This product will help the elderly, diabetics, obese indiviuals, veterans, person with multiple sclerosis and so many other people. The benefits from the use of this product is enormous!</p>

Persons who are diabetic are at risk of having foot amputations if they don’t take care their feet. Statistics show that normally after two or more amputations a person dose not live more than five years. Therefore, the product can be used in helping to prevent this from occuring. National statistics reports that 65% of the country is overweight and 31% of those persons are morbidly obese. In addition, there are over 28 million people in the U.S. who are diabetic and millions more with arthritis and other conditions. People in those categories form a massive market totaling over 180 million. This problem is not limited to the USA but worldwide. Our product simply will make it easier for those with the above conditions, who simply can’t reach those hard to reach areas, to take care of their personal hygiene without any assistance. This product will foster a sense of independence, pride and confidence.</p>
<h3>This is the first patented health care product of its kind</h3>
<p>This product is the only health related product that I have developed. To date, I have successfully gotten the product into local Walgreens stores, local hospitals,Veteran's Hospital and Paralyzed Veterans of America news letter a none for profit organization. This is why funding is needed to give the product more exposure.</p>
<h3>My Dedication</h3>
<p>I have been working to get this product out to the general public and finally its finished. We have identified groups like Paralyzed Veterans of America as being one of the organizations that we would like to make this product available too. In my research I realized that many of our Veterans are diabetic, living alone and need medical care of their feet . I am fully committed to making this happen as I see the need and have personally witnessed the joy on the faces of people that have purchased the product. Several people have thanked me for developing this product as it has met their needs and simplified their lives dramatically. I know by marketing the product via info commercial will open up the awareness of the product to millions of people. Until people start to take full responsibility for their health and eating habits, the problem will only worsen.</p>

<p> </p></div>","My background
I am a Mechanical Design Engineer with over 15 years of extensive manufacturing and product development experience. Also, my experience consist of conceptual design, machine design, packaging, injection molding, and Project Management.
Why this campaign is important to me
My passion was derived from a deep connection for my parents who are very dear to me. During the product inception, my parents were at a point in their life where they no longer could bath themselves properly. After realizing how important it was for them to be able to bath themselves without any assistance, I immediately knew I had to design and develop a product to meet their needs. In the process, not knowing at the time, that thousands of individuals with similar and other issues, would benefit from me developing this product. The reality of loosing such a basic ability, of being able to care for their personal hygiene was devastating to my parents, who had been independent all of their life. They finally allowed me to give them baths, but was still very uncomfortable with my doing so. Well, my parents died before they got a chance to see or use this patented product that I developed. My parent’s death made me more determine to finishing the development and manufacturing of the product for others with similar issues. You and I working together can help thousands or millions of people around the world in giving them a sense of independence in bathing themselves, which unfortunately my parents never got that opportunity. The elderly, person with limited range of motion, obesity and diabetes are real concerns and I am happy to know that I am playing a major role in helping to make many lives better. It gives me great pleasure to think that the product I have developed could be instrumental in saving someone from having a foot amputation or maybe saving a life. Because the facts are, after two amputations the average person does not live more than five years.
What contributors will help me achieve
I desire to raise funds to purchase inventory and market the product to make it available for everyone having limited range of motion and other health related issues. Your contribution will enable us to reach a wide audience by marketing this product on DRTV, social media, hospitals, doctors, nursing homes, etc. Currently we have little inventory and need funds to purchase parts and market the product. The funds will strictly be used for this purpose only. Your contribution will help us make this product available to millions of people. I am sure you know of someone who has a need for this product. Most people who have limited range of motion, have difficulties reaching to clean their lower extremities. Persons who are diabetic, need to inspect their feet every day for sores or ulcers.  Also, the product will help facilitate people with multiple sclerosis who have problems standing on one foot to wash underneath the other foot. This product can also help individuals who have hip, knee and back problems as well as obese individuals. Our product will benefit returning Veterans who have war time injuries to their back or lower extremities. Some veterans are also diabetic.
                                      Returning Veterans
                                

America’s paralyzed veterans have sacrificed so much to protect our country and preserve our freedoms. A donation to Veterans will help our veterans overcome their setbacks and live rich, productive lives. Your support will help us provide rehabilitation and health services, job training, family support, and funding for research working toward better treatments for spinal cord injury and ultimately, a cure. However you choose to support Veterans, your help will make a real difference in our heroes’ lives. Thank you for it. 

                                         Diabetes  
Will you help me to prevent this from occuring? you can by simply supporting my cause. After two amputations the average person does not live more than 5 years.
                                           
Foot ulcers are sores on the feet that can involve just the skin’s surface or can develop into more serious wounds, possibly leading to the loss of a limb. People with chronic conditions, such as diabetes, are particularly susceptible to foot ulcers. In fact, about 15 percent (over 4 million nation wide) of all people with diabetes will develop a foot ulcer at some point in their lives. Practicing good foot care can put the brakes on foot ulcers before they start.
Looking carefully at your feet each day, including between the toes is extremely inportant. If you cannot do this yourself, you should get someone else to do it for you:

Looking at your feet is particularly important if you have reduced sensation in your feet, as you may not notice anything wrong at first until you look.
having a mirror to monitor your feet each day is extremly inportant for (cut, bruise, blister, redness or bleeding)
Use an aparatus for moisturising oil or applying cream for dry skin to prevent cracking.
Look out for athlete's foot (a common minor skin infection). It causes flaky skin and cracks between the toes, which can become a sore and than infected. If you get athlete's foot, it should be treated with an antifungal cream.                                   
                                                        Obesity
                                            
The Centers for Disease Control recently released its Vital Signs report on adult obesity, based on a telephone survey of 400,000 people, and the numbers were undeniably alarming. According to the report, about 2.4 million more adults were obese in 2009 than in 2007. In fact, more than 72 million U.S. adults—or 26.7 percent—are now obese. This is an epidemic in America among adults and children. Of the many statistics about childhood obesity, one in particular highlights the urgency of the problem: One of every three children in America is now considered overweight or obese, and childhood obesity has more than tripled in the past 30 years. As this number continue to climb there are going to be some health issues associated, like type 2 diabetes. Being able to monitor and cleanse areas of your body is going to be an issue with some overweight or obese person. Managing good hygiene is going to be a real concern for some who can’t reach their lower extremities because of being overweight or obese.
What and Why we need the funds for this campaign
I want to raise $165K dollars that will help with marketing needed for DRTV, Internet marketing and purchasing inventory. Your contribution will change so many lives throughout the world. Therefore we would encourage you to contribute in some way. The funds donated for this worthy cause will make a major impact by providing individuals with a better quality of life. It is my passion and full commitment in getting this product into the hands of thousands of individuals that can benefit from its usage. I have been focused on this project for a few years and I am totally committed, because of the needs that so many people have.  We have built a relationship with the VA hospitals and other non profit organizations in helping those individuals with health issues. This product will help the elderly, diabetics, obese indiviuals, veterans, person with multiple sclerosis and so many other people. The benefits from the use of this product is enormous!

<p>Dear Family and Friends,</p>
<p>In May of this year, my mom was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.  The doctors caught the cancer late and she spent the next 2 months undergoing chemo and radiation, five days per week. </p>
<p>But let’s rewind her story just a bit… prior to being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer months ago, what some of you may not know is that my mom was a 2x cancer survivor. </p>
<p>Her first bout with cancer was in 1970, when she was diagnosed with Ovarian Cancer.  She won her battle with Ovarian Cancer but lost her ability to have children.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter my parents adopted me – another tidbit most people do not know – and she lived every day with a single goal: to be the best mother, ever.  And she succeeded; never faltering. </p>
<p>Jump to 2004 and she was diagnosed with Thyroid Cancer.  Again, as if someone was watching over her from above, she beat the disease again. </p>
<p>Now back to her recent battle with cancer… just before Labor Day weekend, she was retested and informed the cancer spread to her liver, bones and lungs.  The Doctors gave her 1-3 months to live!</p>
<p>Despite the news she vowed to fight because she wanted to attend my wedding.  (I got engaged in June, and it was her dream to see my wedding, and the grandchildren that will hopefully follow.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no matter how strong her resolve was to attend my wedding, on 10/1/12 her body had other plans.  She was admitted to Lower Cape Fear Hospice Hospital for care.  Her vitals were strong and they said she had weeks left to live. </p>
<p>Despite the news that she had weeks left to live, on Wednesday morning something guided me to get on a plane and go to her side.  And I did.  Just in time. </p>
<p>After a 13 hour travel day, I arrived at the Hospice facility.  I was able to thank her for everything she taught me, gave me and instilled in me.  As much as I wanted her to make it to my wedding, I told her it was okay to let go; that she was the best mother ever; and now that I have a career I’m proud of and a fiancé that I love, God is telling her that her job on this earth as a mom is complete and it is time for her to rest peacefully.  That it is time for her to go be with loved ones past; that dad and I will be fine.  We’ll always love her and her memory will live on.   </p>
<p>Within hours of having that conversation with my mom, she peacefully passed away.  It was the hardest, but most rewarding and selfless conversation of my life.  But it could not have been scripted any better. </p>
<p>This was the toughest 5 months of my life, but I am very thankful to my Microsoft and NBCNews work family as they allotted me the good fortune to work from home on a week-by-week basis so I could spend precious moments with my mom and dad.  My mom would light up like a kid at Christmas every time I walked thru the front door.  She was truly an inspiring woman and her memory shall never fade.  </p>
<p>I had initially thought of asking for donations to be made in her name to the Cancer Society, but after learning that the Hospice Hospital is funded by donations, I would like to make a donation to the Hospice Hospital in her name.</p>
<p>The Hospice facility is amazing.  It rivals a 4 star resort.  Nurses and doctors on-premise 24 hours a day.  The care and compassion the staff showed my mom during her four days at the facility was touching and I want to make sure that for years to come other families have the fortune of being able to lean on the facility during their time of need.</p>
<p>With each $1000.00 donation that is made to the hospital, an inscribed glass tile is added to the facilities “wall of tributes”.  I’d love nothing more than to raise enough to add 3 tiles to the wall, in memory of: Helen Elizabeth Kapral, Jack, John and Kelly Kapral, and “Family and Friends of the Kapral’s”. </p>
<p>If you have any questions about the donation, the Hospice facility or would like to share stories of other cancer patients, please feel free to reach out to me.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>John</p>

Although I fully advocate for care within ones own home, I recognize that there does come a time for many when difficult decisions have to be made, like placing a loved one in a long term care facility. This I can tell you, is amongst the hardest.

Mum has Alzheimer's, so it seemed befitting to volunteer at the Alzheimer's Society, I have attended many of their confrences, work shops etc. so as to gain an understanding of the illness, and the challenges we would face caring for mum at home.Taking the advice of Mum's care team, my sisters and Iexplored all our options, and as we visited day programs, nursing homes and long term care facilities etc. with Mum, I realized,There is an urgent need for, specialized care residences', designed to address the unique needs of people with Alzheimer's.   
 I run an Eldercare Company, I'm a Champion for Demintia, volunteer at the Alzheimer's Society, undergone specialized (AD)training, and have over 2 decades experience running my own Nursery School business in the UK, this has equipped, and given me insight as to the appropriate care & stimulus required, for persons afflicted with AD .   

Alzheimers disease (and related Dementia) causes physical changes to the brain that affects all areas of functioning and behavior, it is crucial for facilities providing careto adapt their program to meet these unique needs, by developing a very different approach to the traditional care and activities. 
An Alternative To Traditional Long Term Care Institutions
A boutique residence , with a design concept & program, especially for people diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease(AD) or a related dementia. No more that 6 residents... because there are no obvious visible signs of the disease, relating to those invisible losses are one of the most difficult aspects of caring for someone with AD. The Most Important Aspect of our care is, it is completely free of restraints, neither chemical nor physical restraints will ever be used & flexibility so that the residents can:
~ Eat when they are hungry.      
~ Sleep when they are tired.~ Wander around and go outside when they want. ~ Residents feel like they have some independence and control.~ Plan care around each resident  
 Did You Know ?According to the Canadian Institute for Health Information, in 2006-2007, 37.7% of residents residing in long-term care homes on public drug programs were prescribed antipsychotic versus only 2.6% of older adults living in the community?

<h3>About Kadeisha &amp; her Diagnosis</h3>
Kadeisha is a 37-year-old mom of two adorable toddlers (Elijah and Yasmin) and fiancée to Nery Madrid. In December of 2011 Kadeisha discovered a lump in her right breast and after 4 months of seeking answers was diagnosed with aggressive stage 3 cancer.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Kadeisha chose to utilize alternative methods of treatment by seeing a Naturopathic doctor, using juicing, colon therapy, hydrotherapy and high dose Vitamin C to treat cancer sells in a more natural and supportive way to the body. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>By the time she had surgery in May, her tumor had shrunk over a centimeter.  She has made the bold and courageous decision to forego recommended chemotherapy and radiation and stay firm in her conviction that using alternative methods of healing is a more positive and safer way to treat her whole body. Kadeisha's doctors at Three Rivers Natural Medicine in Fort Collins, Colorado are treating her with high dose vitamin C IV, oxidative treatments, ST8 machine and hyberbaric chamber all to introduce high doses of oxygen into the body to kill cancer cells.<br/><p>To deal with the excess estrogen that feeds her cancer response, Kadeisha has chosen also to go natural.  Instead of using Tamoxifen, which is given to block estrogen receptors, she used Indole-3-Carbinol a compound found in cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage, broccoli, kale and cauliflower. It has powerful antioxidant properties and the ability to increase the body’s anti-toxin enzyme activity. Indole-3-carbinol has the ability to break down cancer causing estrogen and dioxin (a pesticide) rendering them harmless.  She is now using DIM, similar to Indole-3-Carbinol, but has been easier on her system.</p>
</div>
<div>Kadeisha has responded very well to these treatments and her last Thermograph body scan showed that currently there are no signs of cancer growing.  The focus is now on getting her inflamed lymphatic system healthy in her breast and throughout the rest of her body.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Your extra helpful support! In order for Kadeisha to continue her treatments for the next six-months to a year, our goal is to raise at least 5,000 dollars.  This would help pay for her naturopathic doctor visits, high dose vitamin C IV’s, natural medicines and continued juicing regimen.  It also helps Nery (her fiancée) and her family, take time from work to support her and their two kids during this process.  Although we know the cost will far exceed $5000, we hope that her story of beating this cancer with alternative medicine will help us surpass our goal significantly.</p>
<p>As Kadeisha heals herself from breast cancer, our intention is to help the family be free of worry and financial burdens. We want our family’s focus to be on helping her back to health and wellness!</p>
<p>Many of you know this family and many of you may not, but know that no matter how you can help- your contribution will help ease the burden of this wonderful family.</p>
</div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Supporting and sharing this campaign will not only support Kadeisha and her family but will also raise awareness about innovative, safe and effective therapies to facilitate healing and prevent disease.  Therapies like homeopathy, acupuncture, herbal medicine and nutrition encourage full and complete healing of mind and body.</p>
<p>It is our hope to promote a path of empowerment for all families to become healthy and vital and to prevent illnesses like cancer, heart disease, etc and improve the quality of all of our lives.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p>Please keep Kadeisha in your thoughts and prayers.  Your positive energy and words of encouragement are always welcomed.  We truly appreciate all of your kindness and support during this difficult time. </p>
<p>Please share this page with everyone you know, such as posting this link on your Facebook page.  Together we can come together to show the greatness of alternative medicine, and show support to Kadeisha on her journey to getting well!</p>

<h3>What is MinBalans?</h3>
<p>Up to 95 % of people that try to get in shape or be healthier, without proffesional assistance, fails. The ones that invest in a personal coach get the real results. Everyone should be able to get a personal coach to finally get in shape,. MinBalans is an application for smartphones that is easy and effective, and puts you in contact with a living coach that supports you and makes you succeed.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Who is it for?</h3>
<p>The system is for<strong> You</strong> who want to get in shape and look and feel your best. It will help you find your weight, be active, stress less and sleep more. From the proffesional athlete to the overworked inactive parent. All in one tool.</p>
<p>It's for the C<strong>oach</strong> (trainer, psychologist, physical therapist, nutritionist) that is lacking a system to work close with their client/patient, and keep them on track between your sessions, or want the opportunity to work and make profit as a <strong>distance coach</strong>.</p>
<p>It's for the C<strong>ompany</strong> that wants to help their employees become and stay healthy, and proactively keep track on their well-being and minimize sick leave.</p>

<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""> </span></p>
<h3 class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">What's so special with the App?</span></h3>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">We are creating a different App, <strong>MinBalans. </strong>The name is Swedish<strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong>it simply<strong> </strong>means ""My Balance"". Having the App is like having <strong>your own</strong> <strong>coach in your pocket </strong>and it will help you make the changes you can’t make on your own. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">It is also a very powerful tool for <strong>existing coaches</strong> to take your clients/patients to new levels.</span></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why is it different than other health tools on the market?</h3>
<p class=""p1""><em><strong>You are no longer on your own. Your Personal Coach will guide you </strong></em></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">MinBalans is the first health tool on the market that offers the user access to a personal distance coach through the app. A living person, a professional, who can follow your steps and guide you. This opens up a world of opportunities to help you succeed. We believe having a distance coach is one of the most cost-effective solutions to create the lasting health changes we lack today. Learn more about the coach system below. </span></p>
<p><em><strong>It's complete</strong></em></p>
<p>MinBalans is different than other health tools and apps on the market. We want to see to the whole of you - <strong>food, activity, sleep and stress</strong>. Just focusing on your diet won’t help you become healthy if you are stressed all the time.</p>
<p><em><strong>It teaches you how to balance</strong></em></p>
<p><span>We don’t believe that you have to live as a robot to achieve good health. That's why most people fail in creating change. It's about knowing how to balance negative impacts with positive behaviors. Live life and feel good about it. Let the app teach you how.</span></p>
<p><em><strong><span class=""s1"">The design is unique. Steve Jobs had it right - Keep it simple</span></strong></em></p>
<p><span class=""s1"">The first step is becoming aware of your habits. This is done </span><span class=""s3"">by logging information on how you live and behave </span><span class=""s1"">in the app. To make people really want to do this, MinBalans has a new type of design and user interface that makes logging easy, effective and fun. Several global studies show that logging lifestyle is one of the strongest factors to help create change. It simply works. </span></p>

<em>* </em>In Swedish ""MinBalans"" simply means ""My Balance"". People need to learn how to balance their lives and get the support they need.</h3></div>","This is a public crowd funding project. The product is NOT on the market yet. With your support we can finish the product. This is how it works:

We need your support to finish the App and the Distance Coach System.
See the movie and/or read the text (at least the first part) to find out why you should support us.
Buy a ""perk"" for a campaign discount, on the right side of the page. You will of course get something in return.
Or, share the project with your friends. Be sure to come back and check in on our progress. 
 
What is MinBalans?
Up to 95 % of people that try to get in shape or be healthier, without proffesional assistance, fails. The ones that invest in a personal coach get the real results. Everyone should be able to get a personal coach to finally get in shape,. MinBalans is an application for smartphones that is easy and effective, and puts you in contact with a living coach that supports you and makes you succeed.
 
Who is it for?
The system is for You who want to get in shape and look and feel your best. It will help you find your weight, be active, stress less and sleep more. From the proffesional athlete to the overworked inactive parent. All in one tool.
It's for the Coach (trainer, psychologist, physical therapist, nutritionist) that is lacking a system to work close with their client/patient, and keep them on track between your sessions, or want the opportunity to work and make profit as a distance coach.
It's for the Company that wants to help their employees become and stay healthy, and proactively keep track on their well-being and minimize sick leave.

 
What's so special with the App?
We are creating a different App, MinBalans. The name is Swedish and it simply means ""My Balance"". Having the App is like having your own coach in your pocket and it will help you make the changes you can’t make on your own. 
It is also a very powerful tool for existing coaches to take your clients/patients to new levels.
 
Why is it different than other health tools on the market?
You are no longer on your own. Your Personal Coach will guide you 
MinBalans is the first health tool on the market that offers the user access to a personal distance coach through the app. A living person, a professional, who can follow your steps and guide you. This opens up a world of opportunities to help you succeed. We believe having a distance coach is one of the most cost-effective solutions to create the lasting health changes we lack today. Learn more about the coach system below. 
It's complete
MinBalans is different than other health tools and apps on the market. We want to see to the whole of you - food, activity, sleep and stress. Just focusing on your diet won’t help you become healthy if you are stressed all the time.
It teaches you how to balance
We don’t believe that you have to live as a robot to achieve good health. That's why most people fail in creating change. It's about knowing how to balance negative impacts with positive behaviors. Live life and feel good about it. Let the app teach you how.
The design is unique. Steve Jobs had it right - Keep it simple
The first step is becoming aware of your habits. This is done by logging information on how you live and behave in the app. To make people really want to do this, MinBalans has a new type of design and user interface that makes logging easy, effective and fun. Several global studies show that logging lifestyle is one of the strongest factors to help create change. It simply works. 
Log information quickly by swiping instead of writing.

 

Direct feedback on your progress through the coach and easy-to-follow statistics.
 
How the Personal Coach works
Tired of not making your goals, as the other 95 % that can't reach them on their own? Then it's time for you do get your personal coach:
-Sign up on a special price Indiegogo deal by buying a coach package, out on the right side of the page, for yourself or a friend.
-When the coach system is finished, you download the app on Appstore (later for Android) and we connect you with our professional coaches.
-Together with the coach we set a plan after your goals.
-You log your progress in the app. The Coach will follow, assist and guide you towards your goal, no matter where you are. This will motivate you like never before, it's proven.
 


If you are working as a trainer, psychologist, physical therapist, nutritionist etcetera, the MinBalans Coach Platform is the tool you've been missing. Take your clients to new levels and profit from it.
The Coach platform allows coaches to assist their clients from their computer or mobile device. In our Perk Section to the right, you can support us and be the first to get access to the web client.

<div>
<p><span><span><strong>Please help us get Ruthie HOME!!!</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong> </strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The two-year mark of that horrific day that ROCKED the Hebden's world is quickly approaching. We are in the process and planning phase of reaching the ultimate goal of this journey... </span></span><strong><span><span>GETTING RUTHIE ""HOME"" FOR GOOD</span></span></strong><span><span>. As most of you recall, Ruthie was in a near fatal automobile accident on December 22, 2010. She sustained a traumatic brain injury, had 3 strokes and has recovered from many other complications resulting from the accident. She has worked so very hard over the past 18 months to regain her life back. She has had to relearn EVERYTHING (eat, walk, talk, etc.). Her survival and recovery has been nothing short of a true miracle. </span></span><strong><span><span>Thanks be to GOD.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span> </span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>We want to take this opportunity to thank all of our </span></span><strong><span><span>""Friend's of Ruth"" </span></span></strong><span><span>for your continued prayers, love and support. Without all of you Ruthie would not be where she is today in her recovery. The funds raised during the ""Friends of Ruth"" benefit in June 2011 enabled Ruthie to attend a 10-week long Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) camp in Canada this past spring. Ruthie made such tremendous progress, and experienced so much healing at Ability Camp that we knew at the conclusion of the spring session that another would be needed in the future. We documented her entire successful journey on a blog web site to share with all of you, </span></span></span><a href=""http://www.friendsofruth.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span><span><span><span lang=""EN""><span><span><span>www.friendsofruth.com</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span lang=""EN""><span><span>. Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy is very expensive and unfortunately is </span></span><strong><span><span>NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE.</span></span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span lang=""EN""><strong><span><span> </span></span></strong></span></span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span><span>We are in the process of having Ruthie evaluated for a piece of equipment called the WalkAide. Ruthie's main obstacle in walking on her own now is due to a problem called Foot Drop. The stroke and/or brain injury caused a neurological disconnect from the brain to the nerve that tells you to lift your foot while walking. This device sends an electrical stimulation to that nerve and lifts her Foot Drop.

Two months prior to Ruthie's tragic accident she trained, raised entry funds and completed the 39-mile Avon Breast Cancer Walk in NYC (with dyed PINK HAIR and all). One day a few months ago Ruthie saw the TV ad for this years Avon Walk. She became very animated and excited when she saw the commercial. She obviously REMEMBERED the hard work training, the grueling raising of donation funds, the excitement of the walk and the total self-satisfaction she felt at the finish line.

<p><span class=""notranlsate"">Calling all Friend's of Ruth. We need your help again. Please help get Ruthie HOME!!! The two-year mark of that horrific day that ROCKED the Hebden's world is quickly approaching. We are in the process and planning phase of reaching the ultimate goal of this journey... GETTING RUTHIE ""HOME"" FOR GOOD. As most of you recall, Ruthie was in a near fatal automobile accident on December 22, 2010. She sustained a traumatic brain injury, had 3 strokes and has recovered from many other complications resulting from the accident. She has worked so very hard over the past 18 months to regain her life back. She has had to relearn EVERYTHING (eat, walk, talk, etc.). Her survival and recovery has been nothing short of a true miracle. Thanks be to GOD. We want to take this opportunity to thank all of our ""Friend's of Ruth"" for your continued prayers, love and support. Without all of you Ruthie would not be were she is today in her recovery. The funds raised during the ""Friends of Ruth"" benefit in June 2011 enabled Ruthie to attend a 10-week long Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) camp in Canada this past spring. Ruthie made such tremendous progress, and experienced so much healing at Ability Camp (<a href=""http://www.abilitycamp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.abilitycamp.com</a>) that we knew at the conclusion of the spring session that another would be needed in the future. We documented the entire successful journey on a blog web site to share with all of you, <a href=""http://www.friendsofruth.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.friendsofruth.com</a>. Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy is very expensive and unfortunately NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE. We are in the process of having Ruthie evaluated for a piece of equipment called the WalkAide. Ruthie's main obstacle in walking on her own now is due to a problem called Foot Drop. The stroke and/or brain injury caused a neurological disconnect from the brain to the nerve that tells you to lift your foot while walking. This device sends an electrical stimulation to that nerve and lifts her Foot Drop. The WalkAide is a very expensive piece of equipment and unfortunately NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE. Ruthie has a very ambitious goal of something very dear to her heart that she wants to participate in this fall. The Avon Breast Cancer Walk in NYC. Two months prior to Ruthie's tragic accident she trained, raised entry funds and completed the 39-mile Avon Breast Cancer walk in NYC (with dyed PINK HAIR and all).

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Rani Hughes. I am an occupational therapist and master trainer in tai chi for health programs. I have been learning and teaching tai chi for over 15 years.  In 2011, I visited Sri Lanka and trained 30 physiotherapists and occupational therapists in Kandy General Hospital in how to conduct safe and effective modified tai chi classes for their patients with chronic health conditions. This training was a great success, the therapist continuing to teach the program to their patients today. All of the costs associated with this workshop was completely covered by me. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Immediately after this workshop, I had many other hospitals, universities and the National Wushsu Coaches Council of Sri Lanka request me to run similar workshops in their region. Unfortunately I had to return to Melbourne, Australia for work.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I want to return to Sri Lanka in January 2013 to offer an update for the health professionals I trained in 2011, and to offer another tai chi 'train the trainer' workshop. However I need your help to make this happen. I can not afford to fund these workshops alone. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As the standard of living in Sri Lanka improves, so too does number of people with chronic disease such as diabetes, heart disease and cancer. Currently Sri Lankan therapists (eg. physiotherapists and occupational therapists) work 1:1 with their patients. This is very time consuming and expensive way to treat patients. Soon, Sri Lanka's public health system will not be able to cope with these new demands. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The benefits of tai chi as a self management strategy to improve health in people with chronic conditions is well established within the medical literature (Journal of Nursing and Healthcare of Chronic Illness, 2011). Modified Tai Chi is taught by therapists to small groups of people with chronic illness, decreasing the demands on therapist's time and saving the government much precious health care money. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Currently, no one in Sri Lanka is able to teach therapists how to conduct safe and effective modified tai chi classes for their patients with chronic illness. Therapist needs to travel abroad to receive this training. As a qualified master trainer in tai chi for health programs, I would like to offer this training in Sri Lanka for health professionals at no cost for the individual or for the hospital they work in. </p>
<p><br/></p>

of KBBI, we are asking you for help in replacing our two beloved audio consoles.
This vital equipment makes it possible for you to hear the programs you cherish
on AM 890. A 23% decrease ($30,500) in state funding prevents
KBBI from launching this project alone and it cannot be held off any longer. <br/><br/><span>We wanted to be realistic and achievable with this online campaign goal of $12,000 though the funding gap is $22,000. All donations will support this vital project.</span> We are excited that we are exceeding the goal. Thank YOU!<br/><div>

<b>What are Audio Consoles:</b><br/>
The
audio consoles are pieces of equipment KBBI uses to route audio from the studio
to broadcast on the airwaves. So when a host is reading your daily Bushlines,
playing music, or patching callers into our live<i> Coffee Table </i>show; our
hearty sound boards are maintaining volume, audio clarity, and much, much more.
This is how we broadcast City Council and Borough Assembly meetings, your
favorite local music shows and the voices of our daily Morning Edition and Weekend Hosts. <br/>
<p>Basically, the
consoles are like a train station. All the trains change tracks and travel in and
out through them. Without them we have no way to use our studio microphones,
play music <span>or as Ron
Burgundy would say, “read the news.” Without them we can’t give you <i>quality local radio.</i></span></p>
<p></p>

<p><b>What's Wrong with KBBI's Current Audio Consoles:</b><br/>
These analog consoles are the heart of KBBI and have been in use 24/7 since 2002. They are old and challenging to operate. The manufacturer doesn't even carry replacement parts anymore. Technology has advanced rapidly over the
years and the consoles have exceeded their lifespan. The reality of the situation
is that these consoles can no longer be repaired and if they fail we will be
off the air.</p>
<b>The Financial Situation:</b><br/>The total cost of the new consoles
and their installation is roughly $52,000 and we are striving to raise 
at least
$12,000 through this crowdsourcing campaign. We are grateful to have 
secured a $25,000 Rasmuson Foundation grant and a $5,000 grant from the 
Homer
Foundation. Thanks to these grants, we are over half-way there which is a fantastic
start! <br/>
</div><b></b><p></p><p><span><b>
</b><span>Although
the funding gap is $22,000, we are only asking for $12,000 through this campaign because we want to set
an achievable goal. If we exceed this goal the additional money
will continue to support this vital project.</span><b><i> <br/></i></b></span></p><p><span><b><i>Timing is urgent</i></b>. Alaska Public Broadcasting Inc. can only pay the labor costs
associated with this project <span>through
the summer. That financial support may not be an option next year due to
the heavy impact of state budget cuts. The labor cost is about $6,000, and is not
included in the project budget.</span><b><b><br/>
<br/>
The Plan</b>:<br/>
</b>We
have consulted a trusted engineer with years of experience working in public
radio stations throughout Alaska. We've researched two audio consoles that we must purchase, with your help, and install this summer.<br/></span></p><p><span><b><b>Getting this show on the Road…with perks!</b><br/>

<br/><p></p></div>","Friends
of KBBI, we are asking you for help in replacing our two beloved audio consoles.
This vital equipment makes it possible for you to hear the programs you cherish
on AM 890. A 23% decrease ($30,500) in state funding prevents
KBBI from launching this project alone and it cannot be held off any longer. We wanted to be realistic and achievable with this online campaign goal of $12,000 though the funding gap is $22,000. All donations will support this vital project. We are excited that we are exceeding the goal. Thank YOU!



What are Audio Consoles:
The
audio consoles are pieces of equipment KBBI uses to route audio from the studio
to broadcast on the airwaves. So when a host is reading your daily Bushlines,
playing music, or patching callers into our live Coffee Table show; our
hearty sound boards are maintaining volume, audio clarity, and much, much more.
This is how we broadcast City Council and Borough Assembly meetings, your
favorite local music shows and the voices of our daily Morning Edition and Weekend Hosts. 
Basically, the
consoles are like a train station. All the trains change tracks and travel in and
out through them. Without them we have no way to use our studio microphones,
play music or as Ron
Burgundy would say, “read the news.” Without them we can’t give you quality local radio.




What's Wrong with KBBI's Current Audio Consoles:
These analog consoles are the heart of KBBI and have been in use 24/7 since 2002. They are old and challenging to operate. The manufacturer doesn't even carry replacement parts anymore. Technology has advanced rapidly over the
years and the consoles have exceeded their lifespan. The reality of the situation
is that these consoles can no longer be repaired and if they fail we will be
off the air.
The Financial Situation:The total cost of the new consoles
and their installation is roughly $52,000 and we are striving to raise 
at least
$12,000 through this crowdsourcing campaign. We are grateful to have 
secured a $25,000 Rasmuson Foundation grant and a $5,000 grant from the 
Homer
Foundation. Thanks to these grants, we are over half-way there which is a fantastic
start! 

Although
the funding gap is $22,000, we are only asking for $12,000 through this campaign because we want to set
an achievable goal. If we exceed this goal the additional money
will continue to support this vital project. Timing is urgent. Alaska Public Broadcasting Inc. can only pay the labor costs
associated with this project through
the summer. That financial support may not be an option next year due to
the heavy impact of state budget cuts. The labor cost is about $6,000, and is not
included in the project budget.

The Plan:
We
have consulted a trusted engineer with years of experience working in public
radio stations throughout Alaska. We've researched two audio consoles that we must purchase, with your help, and install this summer.Getting this show on the Road…with perks!
We have some unique perks to offer. Like co-pilot a DJ show (Ryjil Christianson pictured below with Glenn Caldwell during Slack Tide). Check them all out on the right side of
this page. Click on a perk to go to a payment page. If you wish to keep your support private, select ""Hide my name on the campaign page."" Want to support at a different level? No worries, just enter the amount on the top right above ""contribute now.""
Where Your Donation Will Go:
All funds raised will support this project 100%.

The purchase of two new Wheatstone audio consoles, one for the on-air studio and one for audio production.
Shipping costs to Homer.
Parts, adapters and modifications inside the studios to
     meet the needs of the new digital equipment.
Travel and hosting costs for an engineer to install
     the equipment and reroute our electrical matrix (about 10 days). 
Immense gratitude from KBBI’s staff, volunteers, your fellow listeners and supporters of this project.
Best of all you'll help keep KBBI alive and available in our
     community 24/7.

Together
We Can Make This Happen!

Q.  In what colors will the Get Outside Ball be available?
A.  Each run will feature a different combination of colors; we like colors that remind us of the outdoors: sky blue, sunflower yellow, grass green...

Q.  Will you be featuring ""Social Butterfly Blue""?

A.  No.

Q. Where can I use my Get Outside Ball?
A.  Your Get Outside Ball is compact and its super-lightweight configuration lets you carry it anywhere--to the beach, parties, sports events, political rallies, concerts, MacWorld conventions... anywhere it's OK to have balls.

Q.  Is there anything to download?
A.  There's nothing to download, no drivers to update, no security releases, no registration, no passwords to remember, no hardware or software conflicts, no dongles and no AC adapters. Just get outside and enjoy the sunshine!

Q.  Does the Get Outside Ball give back?
A.  Yes. A portion of our proceeds will be donated to nonprofit organizations that help children in foster care. As much fun as it is to get outside, at the end of the day everyone needs a place to call home. 



The Impact


Your contribution will help our team move from prototype to archetype... no wait, that's not it. We'll move from prototype to purchasing our first run of 1,000 Get Outside Balls. We've sourced them from Europe, so you can expect them to have excellent manners and be snappy little dressers, too. Did we mention they are made from recycled content? Save the oceans! Take care of the turtles, too.
The Get Outside Ball is meant to encourage people to log off and live. Imagine doors opening across the land and people pouring out into the sunshine... frantically searching for a power switch on the Get Outside Ball until they realize, ""This is what freedom feels like.""
It's a good feeling and we hope you will be a part of it. 




Our GratitudeThank you for reading this far! We really appreciate it. 

Please take a minute, step outside, and breathe in some fresh air. Ahhh...
Feeling energized? If you have the time, would you let a friend know about the Get Outside Ball? The pun possibilities (that's how you roll, time to bounce, that one gets around...) are endless, but we'll leave it at: log off and live, log off and love. 


And that’s all there is to it.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello everybody, Thank you for taking the time to visit my page and
learn about my cause. </p>
<p>Every year around Christmas time, I select a charity to donate money
too, one that has some sort of personal connection to me and that I know will
use the money I donate to directly benefit the people they represent. The
organization I chose this year represents something very important to me, which
is why I am seeking out friends, family, and strangers alike to help me make a
large impact.</p>
<p>Within the past year, two of my close friends lost mothers to this horrible disease, and an uncle of mine was recently diagnosed with stage 4
non-smokers lung cancer. </p>
<p>This year in memory and honor of them, the Non-for profit I am donating to, is the Lung Cancer
Alliance. By donating you will:</p>
<p> . Help provide counseling
and guidance for individuals and the families of individuals diagnosed with
lung cancer</p>
<p>. Help fund research to develop better treatments and cures.</p>
<p>. Spread awareness and help eliminate stigma of lung cancer in the
community</p>
<p>Lung cancer is the most deadly cancer in the United States, killing
more people than breast, colon, and prostate cancer combine; it is also the least
funded. Unfortunately Lung cancer is stigmatized as a “smokers disease”, therefore
viewed by many as less deserving of their money. The harsh reality is that 15-20%
diagnosed are non-smokers, another 50% are people who quit smoking before
diagnosis. Regardless of the cause, People affected are still loved and valued
by others and deserve the same amount of compassion. </p>
<p><b>The goal is 1,000 dollars by 12/20/13.</b></p>
<p>I understand many of the people reading this may be a college student,
recent graduate, or simply not in the best financial situation, but Even the
smallest donation will help. If you cannot donate, sharing this page with
somebody who has the means to do so would be greatly appreciated. If you have
any more questions about my efforts or about lung cancer in general, </p>

I have been battling Thyroid Disease since I was 12 when I had a nodule removed. I had a goiter for about 30 years, and then RAI (radio active iodine) treatment for Apathetic Hyperthyroidism which killed off most of my thyroid. Now my dear thyroid has grown a 3cm growth. The FNA biopsy found some suspicious cells which cannot be determined to be cancerous or beign unless it is surgically removed and then biopsied. They are only taking half of my diseased thyroid now, but if the tests come back positive for cancer, I will need to have a another surgery, total thyroidectomy and follow up.</p>
<p>I go to a wonderful clinic here in the Memphis area. Because of the many health challenges this past year, I am currently unemployed but the clinic offers discount rates on medical services. Which means I still have to pay my share of the office visit and surgeon fee. The hospital, anesthesiologist, and other costs associated with the surgery would not be discounted. I am already struggling to pay off over $5,000 in hospital bills and there is no way I can come up with the money needed for this surgery in the near future. </p>
<p>The sad thing I have learned this past year is that there are so many who are without any health insurance and struggle to afford and obtain quality health care. I was recently diagnosed with diabetes which makes me pretty much unable to obtain health insurance even if I were employed and could afford it. I am thankful there are places and caring people that help the uninsured and underinsured.</p>

</li>
<li>C2E2 (Chicago, April 25-27)</li>
<li>Wizard World (Rosemont, August 21-24)</li>

<li>Integrating with your local comic shop and online retailers to help you pick up that issue you missed last month.</li>
<li>Support for more platforms, such as tablets and desktop computers. Find out what you want, anywhere you may be.</li>
<li>Collection management support. Catalog your collection so that you fill the holes without accidentally picking up the same issue twice.</li>

<li>For the super fans who support us in the range of $10 to $100 donations, we'll set you up with a full package of the swag we'll be giving out to fans at the show.

<br/><br/><h2>Our Compelling Story</h2>
<p>Over a decade ago, Baxter and Isabelle met in Mallorca and 
were invited to inspect a rare piece of jungle in South-East Asia that 
nobody had seen since the French in 1945. The trip forged a strong friendship and mutual respect where they slept in caves, swam in the Mekong, and ended up on a fig farm in Australia (special plug here for Willabrand figs). <br/></p>
<p>Isabelle returned to Spain where she developed her talents in filmmaking and editing, baby making and raising.<br/></p>
<p>It was a journey which also 
led Baxter to the Yoga mat. Within a year, she traveled to India, studied in an ashram and become an instructor. Since then, there has 
rarely been a day that Yoga hasn't featured in Baxter's life. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>A
 desire to apply Yoga in a more beneficial way lead Baxter to study a 
post graduate with Yoga Therapy Australia under some of the most experienced teachers
 in the world from the KYM lineage.<br/></p>
<p>Wanting to create an on-line presence to deliver 
the benefits of Yoga more efficiently without compromising the 
principles of Therapeutic Yoga, she realised that breath practices hold 
the key - for three reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can be customised to the user via a simple assessment.<br/>
</li>
<li>They create no harm or injury.</li>
<li>They are simple and efficient, no matter how complex the issue.</li>

<p>14 years later, Baxter and Isabelle reunited in LA and, given their qualifications, skills, and creative compatibility, they decided to work on this Breath Taking project together. <br/></p>
<p>And because things come full circle, Baxter is now the proud Godmother of Sienna, Isabelle's 6 month old daughter.<br/></p>
<p>The rest of the team came together under synchronistic circumstances, like a chance conversation in a Yoga classes, or a bike ride along a desert trail.</p>

</div><h2><i>""Why can’t I just use my own breath to calm me down?""</i></h2><p>It’s very difficult for anybody to maintain a conscious breathing 
pattern for longer than one minute (try it for yourself and see how it

It's the first app of its kind in the world.
""The breath is the intelligence of the body""

T.K.V. Desikachar

Breath Taking is based on a collective 40 years of leading breath professionals including renowned biologists, yoga therapists 
and doctors.It’s this experience, combined with the fact that the digital health market is one of the fastest growing industries (80% every year) that led us to developBreath Taking: a series of apps which will address conditions like: 

Blood Pressure


Sleep Issues 

Fear of Flying and wait for it....

Erectile Dysfunction (Yes, there's a breath for that).



Click on the play button above. It's only a short sample to give you a taste. 

You can also try the tracks in their full length here (they are live for 2 weeks only)

The Blood Pressure Breath
The first, and most essential app we've created is designed to target your parasympathetic nervous system and induce calming effects.To measure this, we've also included tools to record your vitals (BP, pulse, and state of mind).We've called it Breath Taking for Blood Pressure (BT4 Blood Pressure)  and it will be test (beta) launched in Dec 2015.
We know how calm we feel after a relaxing practice like breathing.Science has done the research.But when we graph your results, you can actually SEE how relaxed you FEEL and thereby become your own research experiment. 


You'll
 be able to share this information with your practitioner or friend; set
 yourself reminders, choose your own background music, length of 
practice, and breath length. The app will be rich in content yet simple to use. 
""Slow and regular breathing was found to be efficacious in reducing high
 BP during 2 months of self-treatment by patients at home""Ehud Grossman, Journal of Human Hypertension

You, as a donor, will have a direct impact on someone’s health.That's a pretty fabulous contribution, don't you think?


Our StrategyBecause we're interested in the creative process, we decided to build this from scratch and learn many of the systems it requires to successfully design, market and inspire. Once this BT4 Blood Pressure breath has been released, we'll focus on subsequent apps:

BT4 Sleep Issues 

BT4 Fear of Flying 

BT4 Erectile Dysfunction
BT Library


Here are some more situations our BT Library will address:
Pitching an idea
Performance anxiety (on the stage, as an athlete, or in the boardroom)
Interviews
Exams

Addictions
High Anxiety
Grief/ Trauma
Pre-natal preparations
The First Date
Paramedic’s breath for victims at-the-scene 
Panic Attacks
Traffic jams
Drowsy driving
The Dentist chair
A Difficult Conversation
Relationship challenges at home or at work
Anticipating an Upcoming Event that we’re not looking forward to (like surgery)

Dealing with an Upset Child
A Noisy Neighbor

From our extensive research, we believe that these apps will be the first of their kind in the world in terms of delivering customised breaths for common situations.

</div></div>","""Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring, all of which have the potential to turn a life around."" - Leo F. BuscagliaThe first thing that jumps out when you first see Jeanne is her radiating smile.  A smile that has been a constant throughout all the hurdles she has overcome in her life.  Jeanne worked tirelessly multiple jobs as a single mom to raise and support her two kids, all while coping with family members suffering from cancer.  Tragically she lost her mother, aunt, sister and brother to this deadly disease, but her smile kept her and the people she loves around her going strong.Although not done with ease, Jeanne eventually prevailed and started over.  In August 2008, her hard work paid off; she rebuilt her life in North Carolina and she fulfilled her lifelong dream of owning a Home Decor Store, known as Mee Shells, that expressed her artistic talents.  In May 2011, just when the business started thriving, Jeanne was diagnosed with HER-2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2), an aggressive form of breast cancer.  Fortunately for her it was found at Stage 1, however it can easily jump to Stage 4.  After a double mastectomy and several treatments of chemotherapy, the life she fought to rebuild is under attack once again due to mounting debt caused by her absence throughout this trial.I am Jeanne's friend Valerie.  After enduring the loss of my mother, Jeanne stepped in and picked me up off the floor when I fell, like she has done for countless people throughout her life.  Now is our chance to return her selflessness. 

Jeanne is on the verge of losing her life's work.  Your support will help pay for the bills that accumulated during her treatments, and get her back on track to keep her home and business alive.  100% of your donations will go to Jeanne's cause.

One of
our dearest friends, Carl & Whitney DeJohn have been faced with caring for
their amazing two year old son (Carl Joseph DeJohn III) whom has a congenital heart defect
(Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome). 
CJ was born August 19, 2009 while they were
living in Colorado Springs, but these circumstances caused them to move their
lives back to Cleveland this past year.



CJ just
had his third heart surgery September
2, 2011, just
days after his second birthday. 
While the heart surgery was a success, CJ suffered a stroke and
subsequent seizures during his recovery, and is now in intensive therapy to
regain movement of the left side of his body and re-learn many of the motor
skills he has lost.

Our group
of friends has watched from the sidelines for far too long, as Carl and Whitney
have been absolute rocks, rising to meet every earth shattering challenge that
approaches CJ.  As medical bills
pile up dating back to CJ’s birth, and Whitney being the primary care-giver for
CJ and unable to work, we are coming together to raise money to alleviate the
pressure on these amazing parents.

We felt
compelled as friends to do something. Carl and Whitney have been nothing less than stoic throughout this
experience, cherish every moment with CJ, and would never ask for anything.  CJ is the happiest and sweetest little
guy who touches everyone’s hearts that come in contact with him.

In CJ's Parents Words...
Starting our life together in
Colorado Springs, we were excited to welcome what we thought was a perfectly
healthy baby boy. All the doctors, tests, and ultrasounds throughout the
pregnancy told us that everything looked normal. We had no idea the kind of
devastating and life altering changes that were coming. During labor and
delivery there was still no indication of any problems.  The umbilical cord was wrapped around
his neck so they took him to the NICU for “just a few tests”.  Next thing we knew he was being flown to
Denver Children’s Hospital and told that our newborn baby, who we hadn’t even
held yet, had a potentially fatal heart defect called Hypoplastic Left Heart
Syndrome (HLHS). We had 2 options, a heart transplant or a series of 3
surgeries over the first few years of his life.
It was decided the best option for CJ was a series of
surgeries called the Norwood Procedure. This meant he would be on the operating
table for his 1st open heart surgery at just 5 days old. He made it
out of surgery and stayed in the hospital for 5 weeks with both of us at his
bedside, not going to work, not living in our home, and not sure if he would

2nd surgery he developed a bad infection under the incision on his
chest. After multiple trips back and forth to the hospital and concerns of
infection and blood disease, the surgeon took CJ once again to the operating

lead into his 2nd open heart surgery at 5 months old, the Glenn

During this time we discovered
that the 7000ft elevation in Colorado would eventually cause problems with CJ’s

but we knew it was all for CJ.

Before we knew it, it was time
for CJ’s 3rd  and
hopefully final open heart surgery, the Fontan Procedure. We had been told that

they have more energy and are more medically stable. We were so excited to move

<p>ph360 is the engine behind Shae.

Shae is mobile and designed to remove the hard work from health, giving you the personalized advice you need when you need it, and removing the effort for you where it can. For example, Shae will update your breakfast menu if you work out harder than you thought you would in the morning so you have plenty of energy for the rest of the day, or Shae might order a personalized meal to arrive at your door right when it's the perfect time for your body to eat.</p>

</div></div>","Shae is your very own virtual health assistant that uses interactive voice and text conversation to communicate a personalized health plan with you in real time via your phone, tablet, laptop, desktop, smartwatch, or any connected device.
Shae lets you know exactly what and when to eat & drink to be healthy, formulating advice 100% specific to your body, lifestyle and preferences - not one person in the world receives the same information.

Welcome to Shae: Health Without Thinking™ - finally you don't need to know anything about health, or even remember your health, to be healthy.

Imagine having a whole encyclopedia just about you - your health history, your genetic circumstances, your optimal lifestyle. 100% specific to you. And imagine this encyclopedia had been built by the most incredible minds in science and medicine from all around the world. It even knew how any specific food would interact with your body to support, or challenge, its biochemistry, physiology, and genetics - the things that determine its health and wellbeing. 




And now imagine that there’s an assistant that can read that encyclopedia super fast and answer any food or lifestyle question you ever have, in real-time. And even better, this assistant can intuitively read ahead, and notify you in advance of what to eat and how to live to keep your body at it’s optimal health all the time, without you even asking it.



Shae was created by an international team of leading medical doctors, scientists and researchers who have been working on an evidence-based solution to prevent chronic pain and disease on a global scale for more than 10 years.


Shae has been making waves in the media since 2014. What’s all the buzz about? Read on to find out why we created Shae, what Shae does, how Shae works, and more.



Shae is so much more than your average $4.99 health app – here’s why...



Shae is not just your health assistant. Shae is your life assistant, providing you with information, motivation, and skills to accomplish all that you want. 

Shae’s job is to know the detailed health status of your body at any given moment in time, and to decide what you need to eat or drink to obtain, or maintain, your optimal health.
Shae knows the imbalances or deficiencies in vitamins and minerals you may have that can affect the function of your vital organs, tissues or genes which can contribute towards disease or illness.
Shae knows what you need to be healthy and happy, will communicate this with you in advance in a fun and interactive manner, talk with your wearables, and will guide you to achieve the health you’ve always wanted without you having to even think about it.
Shae makes being healthy so simple. Here’s how.
With Shae, Janice knows just when and what to have for dinner to feel her best.
With Shae, Joey’s no longer rushing to find last-minute food options that suit him.He’s prepared well in advance to keep his energy and productivity up. 
Having a hard time deciding what to order? With Shae, Orlando goes out to eat with his friends, and feels great sharing laughs and eating a delicious meal that’s perfectly healthy for him.
With Shae, Rebecca and Robert know whether - and why - to go for that extra slice of cheese.
With Shae, health is accessible and achievable for Janice, Rebecca, Robert, Joey, Orlando, and every one of us.


That’s right. Shae can pretty much do everything but eat your food for you. Thanks, Shae.

participate in Lendon Gray's 2016 Winter Intensive Training program (WIT) in
Wellington, Florida. Lendon is a 2-time Olympian, president of Dressage 4 Kids
and an advocate of youth in dressage. The WIT Program starts January 2016
and continues for 3 months.  My 10 hour days will be filled
with rider fitness, theory, riding lessons, lectures and field
trips... and of course the care of BoBo. The program is scheduled for 6 days a
week with one day off. My day off will be spent working for my supportive trainer JJ
Tate.  </p>
<p>The WIT Program is designed for young riders who strive to be the best
they can be and show determination, drive and passion for the sport of
dressage. Riding daily under the tutelage of Lendon Gray will take my riding to
a whole new level. Lendon has a way of pushing you to be the best you can be. I
eagerly look forward to this challenge. I plan to ride and train dressage horses as a professional and hope to represent the United States in international competition.</p>
<p>I am 15 years old and began riding when I was 7. My riding focus changed to dressage in my 10th year after watching Edward Gal and Moorlands Totilis freestyle in the 2010 World Equestrian Games. I have been riding BoBo since June of 2015. </p><p></p><p>BoBo is a 16 year old Dutch Riding Pony
with the personality the size of a large warmblood. We are leasing him from
Dressage 4 Kids and it is my goal to compete in the FEI Pony Classes in
Wellington and quality for the Festival of Champions in 2016. BoBo and I
successfully competed at the National Pony Cup in Kentucky and Dressage at
Devon. We are developing a wonderful bond of trust and respect. BoBo is one of
the sweetest and smartest ponies I have ever ridden. Once you gain BoBo's
trust, he throws his heart into his work.    </p>
<p></p><p>Total training in
Wellington will cost a minimal of $15,950 which includes my training, board for
BoBo, a rental, vet and farrier expenses and transportation.  It is our
goal to raise $8,250 through Indiegogo to cover our training and board for
BoBo.  I am covering the remainder of the fees from my summer savings of

<h2><strong>WHY MASHUP™ ?</strong></h2>
<p>We know what you are thinking, another workout video that you can do at home. It's way more than that. </p>

<p>We are looking to take our fitness program to the digital world to make our program more accessible to a number of coaches and potential participants. While we currently have a DVD series available for purchase online, we are looking to grow our brand with three specific digital projects. With this campaign we would be able to fund these key projects: filming videos for our fitness app, a coach’s online portal and building an online coach’s certification program.</p>
<p>With these projects, we will be able to take <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">MASHUP™ </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">to the next level and help others truly achieve overall optimal wellness. </span></p>
<p>MASHUP™ <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">is not just a workout, but a scientific formula to live a balanced lifestyle.</span></p>
<h2><strong>THE SCIENCE BEHIND MASHUP™ </strong></h2>
<p>MASHUP™<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> is a variable-intensity interval training (VIIT) program that allows participants to attain true HIIT intervals combined with Mind/Body (yoga/Pilates) and Agility &amp; Strength at 3 different fitness levels. Every workout challenges the entire body in numerous ways you are performing every type of movement. The  Mind/Body helps to prevent injury and provide core strength while the Agility and Strength help to strengthen muscles and increase your metabolism up to 48 hours post workout as your body rebuilds and repairs. The high-intensity intervals have been shown to stimulate production of human growth hormone (HGH) from 450% - 721% during the first 24 hours after your workout. HGH not only promotes fat loss but also provides anti-aging effects, contributing to vigor and optimal wellness. If you want to change your body you need MASHUP™'s formula to get you there!</span></p>
<p>MASHUP™ has no choreographed movements, but instead unites all three modalities for all fitness levels in every workout. It can be experienced in 15, 30, or 45-minute workouts, while utilizing the body's five major muscle groups. These unique science-generated formats allow instructors to utilize various movements to customize each class making each experience fresh, dynamic, and challenging for participants.</p>

<p>Kenko is an herbal daily supplement that came to life after my unsuccessful search for honest and reliable access to the medicines of the Eastern cultures.<br/></p>
<p>It started in February of 2014. A coworker commented on my sluggish entrance to the break room. After describing two days of scheduling mishaps, expensive doctor visits, and multiple failed attempts to pick up my prescription, my coworker looked me over and said, Well, you still don't look very good.""</p>
<p>""The doctor told me it will take a couple days for the meds to kick in,"" I replied.</p>
<p>""You know, you should drink some ginseng tea with a couple drops of oil of oregano.""</p>

<p><i>At GNC, for example, the agency found that five out of six samples from the company’s signature “Herbal Plus” brand of supplements “were either unrecognizable or a substance other than what they claimed to be.” In pills labeled ginkgo biloba, the agency found only rice, asparagus and spruce, an ornamental plant commonly used for Christmas decorations.""</i></p>

Kenko is an herbal daily supplement that came to life after my unsuccessful search for honest and reliable access to the medicines of the Eastern cultures.
It started in February of 2014. A coworker commented on my sluggish entrance to the break room. After describing two days of scheduling mishaps, expensive doctor visits, and multiple failed attempts to pick up my prescription, my coworker looked me over and said, Well, you still don't look very good.""
""The doctor told me it will take a couple days for the meds to kick in,"" I replied.
""You know, you should drink some ginseng tea with a couple drops of oil of oregano.""

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>While there are many electric toothbrushes on the market already, they almost uniformly come with three major disadvantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>They’re inconvenient to carry.</li>
<li>The toothbrush heads are expensive.</li>
<li> They’re not sterile.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Allegro Sonic Electric Toothbrush is engineered in response to all three of these disadvantages. This portable electric toothbrush, equipped with a more economical toothbrush head, simply makes more sense than the electric toothbrushes that are on the market right now. Well made and intelligently designed, the Allegro Sonic Electric Toothbrush is available in two versions, one featuring a cup with inductive charging, UV sterilization, and drying functions, and the other featuring our more basic, economical kit.</p>
<p>The “Cup” version of the Allegro Sonic Electric Toothbrush is just as portable as the standard version, taking up a minimum of space in your luggage.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Right now, we have come to you,Indiegogo, for help raising $59. These funds will cover the costs of manufacturing, marketing, and distributing the first run of the Allegro Sonic Electric Toothbrush. As a thank-you, we are offering our kits at a steep discount on the MSRP, and the more kits you buy (Why not stock up or get one or two as gifts?), the bigger the discount is!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We all know how important dental hygiene is, and the facts remain that the electric toothbrushes that are being sold are sub-par in more ways than one. The Allegro Sonic Electric Toothbrush is a solution that we can all get behind, as powerful as it is convenient. This is the electric toothbrush done the right way.</p>

Throughout the year we have been learning about philanthropy and the Jewish values associated with it. The main principle we are focusing on is the Jewish value of <em>tzedakah</em>. Though literally translated as righteousness or justice, <em>tzedakah</em>is used in Judaism as the concept of a religious obligation to do what is right.

Throughout the year we have been learning about philanthropy and the Jewish values associated with it. The main principle we are focusing on is the Jewish value of tzedakah. Though literally translated as righteousness or justice, tzedakahis used in Judaism as the concept of a religious obligation to do what is right. Our group feels that supporting charities is one of the ways we can make the world a better place, which is part of what Judaism is centered on.

<p>My name is Nyasha Tirivayi and I live in the Netherlands. More than two weeks ago I received a medical appeal from a colleague in Kenya about Baby Chloe who needed immediate life saving heart surgery. As a mother of 2 , the youngest being 11 months old, I was indeed touched by Baby Chloe's condition. She had a severe case of  v<span>entricular septal defect i.e. there were no chambers in her heart</span>. This condition results in the mixing of oxygenated blood and deoxygenated blood in the heart. We set up this campaign to help her get life saving surgery before she reached six months in January. Sadly Chloe passed away on Christmas morning.  Apparently she succumbed to the complications of her condition, as she had low oxygen saturation and was convulsing repeatedly. </p>
<p><br/>Nancy, myself and Nyasha have been thinking about the way forward. We decided that its best to remit all donations to children's heart charities so we can help other  babies and children like Chloe. To this end we have identified Open Hearts for Kids in the Netherlands (<a href=""http://www.openheartsforkids.nl/index2.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.openheartsforkids.nl/index2.php</a>) and Take Heart Association project in Kenya (<a href=""http://www.thapkenya.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.thapkenya.org/</a>) as the charities we can send our donations do.</p>
<p><span>We are sad Chloe is no longer is with us. Yet, we take heart in that there are people like you in this world who care! </span></p>
<p>You can help by contributing and getting word out about children with congenital heart disease . </p>

Who we are:First Steps Wellness Centre (FSWC), a non-profit organization, is one of Canada’s leading facilities for spinal cord injury and neuromuscular recovery.How it all started:First Steps Wellness Centre (FSWC) was approached by a family asking if we provide any services that could be used for their child who has cerebral palsy. The family explained that they have been in search of a program that will help correct their child’s movement patterns, improve function, and enhance quality of life. Unfortunately we did not have a program specific to these elements.  We started talking about it and realized, "" why couldn’t we implement such a program?""  The elements wanted by the family, aligns perfectly with the views and goals FSWC already has in place.  And so began our search for an established and successful program designed specifically to improve functional movement and quality of life for children with neuromuscular or congenital disorders such as Cerebral Palsy or Spina Bifida.Our research led us to a highly successful program called the TheraSuit Method®. Developed by two physiotherapists, this program is a unique and cutting edge service that is being used all around the world to improve a child’s functional movement. This creative approach is exactly the kind of program that can change a child’s life.Stats
In a recent TheraSuit® study, the following astonishing results were reported:

Traditional therapy assists people to adapt to life with a disability. FSWC along with  the TheraSuit Method®, aims to increase the function level of the child to improve  quality of life.  The TheraSuit® has been able to help children with conditions such as Cerebral Palsy and Spina Bifida learn or re-learn a movement in as little as 3 weeks as compared to traditional therapy where learning to do this same movement could take up to a year! There is no other program of this kind that is reporting such astounding results and that’s what really caught our eye.We want to help children have a chance at reaching their full potential and improve their quality of life.  There is not a service offered in Saskatchewan that provides a program for children that targets improvement in movement patterning and function. We feel the TheraSuit Method® can provide just that!We are raising money to bring the TheraSuit Method® to Saskatchewan! We need your help to get our therapists trained in this exciting new technique so that together we can change a child’s life and to do this we need $25,000.Let’s all come together and provide a service that can really change a child’s life.Perks:

<p>In the year that RIDE has been open, we have served our community in many ways such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Daily free RIDEs for at-risk youth from Kinwell Academy and Indiana Academy.</li>
<li>RIDEs for the Grant County Rescue Mission where you RIDE for free by bringing in a non-perishable item for their food bank.</li>
<li>Local school sports teams from Marion High School and Mississinewa High School rode for free for team-building and encouragement.</li>
<li>A child abuse awareness and prevention RIDE where 100% of the proceeds went to a Grant County Child Abuse Prevention organization.</li>
<li>Anti-bully RIDE where 100% of the proceeds went to Big Rob Non-Profit Organization for their anti-bully program.</li>
<li>Provided 30 kids with shirts and water bottles to make their RIDE more comfortable.</li>
<li>Partnered with local schools to offer RIDEs to teachers and staff at a discounted rate to help with stress management. </li>
</ul>
<p>For this school year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Additional schools want to participate at RIDE with their life skills programs.</li>
<li>A local non-profit that works with special needs junior and seniors wants to partner with RIDE for exercise and life skills activities.</li>
<li>More sports teams wants to utilize RIDE for cross training when weather is not conducive to outdoor training.</li>
<li>A non-profit organization that helps abused and homeless women has reached out to partner with RIDE.</li>
<li>A Y12SR addiction relapse prevention leader has partnered with RIDE to teach two Saturdays a month. These classes will be offered free of charge.</li>
<li>We have also partnered with a 3rd Degree Blackbelt and certified instructor to teach self-defense. These classes will be free to attend.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just the start of our vision to reach out to the community. We had previously planned to become a non-profit, but intermingling profit and non-profit is a challenge we were not ready to take on. So we are keeping the faith that God will provide and calling on all angels that want to see a change and revival in our community. Each one reach one. </p>
<p>In addition to RIDE, we want to open a plant-based cafe and juice bar to provide juices, smoothies, salads, and quick on-the-go healthy food. We truly believe that part of healing involves your nutrition.</p>
<p>We hope we can come together as a community and accomplish the goals set for the year ahead. With a little contribution from many we believe the sky is the limit for positive change in our community.  <br/> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>We need your support to help fund the outreach programs and bring a healthy food cafe to our community. In addition to the satisfaction you will get from contributing to the greater good, you will also receive tangible rewards, as noted in the perks section. </p>
<ul>
<li>We estimate it will take &gt;$50k to support the RIDE outreach programs plus remodel the building and get all the restaurant equipment. In the event, we don't reach our entire goal, we will use the funds to first support the most needed programs such as at-risk youth, addiction recovery, self-defense, etc.  </li>
<li>Our perks range from a shout out on social media to coupons for juice and smoothies to a big banner on our building which is located on Main Street of a very busy highway. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will make a positive difference in the life of the most vulnerable among us:</p>
<ul>
<li>At-risk youth learning valuable life-skills that will help them get a job and start a career (or business) after high school/college, such as gardening, exercise instruction, customer service, and restaurant management,</li>
<li>A place for abused women to find support, a positive outlet, and hope for a brighter future.</li>
<li>Help those with health and allergy issues have a whole food plant-based alternative when dining out and on the go. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Instead of focusing on what if for some unforeseen God given reason this thriving business was to close down and you didn't get your name on the founders wall, or didn't get to finish out your year membership, or lost out on some free juices, let's instead talk about the REAL risk factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>What if you don't contribute and one of our youth could have experienced a culture of health and wellness and positive environment full of encouragement and motivation that they didn't even know existed.</li>
<li>What if even one person struggling with addictions could be mentored and helped. </li>
<li>What if women feeling hopeless and despair could have been given an outlet and shown that she is surrounded by a community that is willing to show her love, positivity, and pray with her.</li>
<li>What if one person can be helped to get off their medications because of proper nutrition and fitness.</li>
<li>What if one person can reverse years of self-doubt and self-sabotage by surrounding themselves with health conscious people that have been exactly where they are at.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are there risks to investing? Absolutely! There is always a risk, but ask yourself what is the risk of not investing? </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot contribute at this time, we understand, but you can still help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spread the word. Let's make some noise about this community-minded, mission-driven business and the crowdfunding campaign to serve more people in Grant County Indiana and the surrounding area, plus travelers looking for healthy vegan food. </li>

</div><p> </p></div>","In the year that RIDE has been open, we have served our community in many ways such as:

Daily free RIDEs for at-risk youth from Kinwell Academy and Indiana Academy.
RIDEs for the Grant County Rescue Mission where you RIDE for free by bringing in a non-perishable item for their food bank.
Local school sports teams from Marion High School and Mississinewa High School rode for free for team-building and encouragement.
A child abuse awareness and prevention RIDE where 100% of the proceeds went to a Grant County Child Abuse Prevention organization.
Anti-bully RIDE where 100% of the proceeds went to Big Rob Non-Profit Organization for their anti-bully program.
Provided 30 kids with shirts and water bottles to make their RIDE more comfortable.
Partnered with local schools to offer RIDEs to teachers and staff at a discounted rate to help with stress management. 

For this school year:

Additional schools want to participate at RIDE with their life skills programs.
A local non-profit that works with special needs junior and seniors wants to partner with RIDE for exercise and life skills activities.
More sports teams wants to utilize RIDE for cross training when weather is not conducive to outdoor training.
A non-profit organization that helps abused and homeless women has reached out to partner with RIDE.
A Y12SR addiction relapse prevention leader has partnered with RIDE to teach two Saturdays a month. These classes will be offered free of charge.
We have also partnered with a 3rd Degree Blackbelt and certified instructor to teach self-defense. These classes will be free to attend.

This is just the start of our vision to reach out to the community.

<b>Q</b>uick Summary (English)</h2><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p>Very important information about your health is hidden in your DNA. We
can decode your DNA <span><del></del>to provide
information about your potential health status. Using predictive gene
diagnostics, we can identify
which genetic diseases you are at risk of developing. Furthermore, in </span><span>pharmacogenomics </span><span>we can
analyze your DNA to determine which
medications will be most
effective for you, and at what dose. We can also analyze genetic
predispositions to food intolerance and other genetic health factors. Our
special offer is Whole-Genome-Sequencing, including genes of as yet
unknown function. New research results relating to genes, health and disease
can be immediately translated and applied to your genetic profile without
further lab testing.</span></p>
<p><b>Background and Aims</b></p>
<p><span>We are
different due to our genetic profile or DNA sequence – some of us are tall and
some short, some have blue eyes and others brown eyes. Similarly, our response
to medications may also be different depending
on our DNA. In some people a standard
drug dose may be ineffective,
while in others it may have a
toxic effect. Instead of being reliant on standard medication regimes, our
technology allows for providing specific therapies (personalized medicine) tailored to
individual needs. Our aim is to increase your quality of life.</span></p>
<p><b>Your benefit</b></p>
<p>You can obtain the correct
dose of medication adjusted to your body. Don’t try <span>ineffective
drugs and don’t take the risk of toxicity by
medication. Is there an increased risk of developing specific diseases in your
family? Our technology allows for providing you with a personal risk profile. With this
knowledge you have the option of taking preventive steps or making more
informed choices about your treatment. </span></p>
<p><b>Our barrier</b></p>
<p>Our barrier is to finance a
laboratory with state-of-the-art technology, which is able to produce reliable,
high-precision and reproducible results, which can be analyzed by our highly
qualified scientists.</p>
<p><b>Support</b></p>
<p>To provide this valuable
service we need your financial support. Please share this campaign with your
friends and relatives via Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other social media. As
an expression of gratitude for your support we will offer you genetic analyses at an exclusive<span><del></del>
reduced Indiegogo price. We will analyze your samples in 2015. If we are unable
to start our company, your donation will be fully refunded.  </span></p>
<p><b>Perks</b></p>
<p>Every single donation counts,
it doesn’t matter how low or high. It shows us your interest in our genetic
health service. We need your support to start this company. You will receive your
genetic analysis from the special price of 250 Euro<span></span> <span>(starting at 450 Euro). <span>You can select different
gene analyses, diseases and drugs of <del></del>interest to you, and after
analyzing your DNA, we can provide you with important health information, which is tailored to your DNA profile. Please ask us for medication
and genetic diseases which are not listed here, because we may also analyze
them.</span></span></p>

<br/><br/><h2 align=""left""><b>Kurzbeschreibung – <br/></b></h2>
<h2 align=""left""><b>Dr. Seibt Genomics (Deutsch)</b></h2>
<p>Viele sehr wichtige Informationen über Ihre Gesundheit
liegen in Ihrer DNA verborgen. Wir entschlüsseln dieses Wissen für Sie. Mit der
prädiktiven Gendiagnostik klären wir Sie darüber auf, welche genetischen
Krankheiten Sie erwarten oder verschonen. Anhand Ihrer DNA können wir Ihnen
vorhersagen, welche Arzneimittel bei Ihnen wirken und welche nicht. Außerdem
passen wir mittels Pharmakogenomik die Dosis individuell auf Ihre DNA an.
Zusätzlich untersuchen wir genetisch bedingte Lebensmittel(un)verträglichkeiten
und genetische Gesundheitsfaktoren. Eine Besonderheit ist die gesamte Genomanalyse
inklusive Auswertung, bei der alle Gene untersucht werden, auch diejenigen,
deren Bedeutung heute noch nicht erforscht ist. Bei neuen Forschungsergebnissen
ist ein einfacher und schneller Abgleich, ohne erneute Analyse, möglich.</p>
<p><b>Hintergrund und Ziele</b></p>
<p>Menschen sind unterschiedlich - manche sind groß oder
klein, haben blaue oder braune Augen. Wie ein Arzneimittel wirkt ist genauso
unterschiedlich. Eine Standarddosis hat bei manchen Menschen keine Wirkung und
bei anderen bereits eine toxische. Verlassen Sie die übliche Massentherapie und
gehen Sie zusammen mit Dr. Seibt Genomics zur maßgeschneiderten
Individualtherapie über.<span> Unser Ziel ist
die Verbesserung der Lebensqualität eines jeden Menschen.</span></p>
<p><b>Ihr Vorteil </b></p>
<p>Probieren Sie keine unwirksamen Arzneimittel aus und
liefern Sie sich nicht mehr der Gefahr der Überdosierung aus. Sind in Ihrer
Familie vermehrt bestimmte Krankheiten aufgetreten? Erfahren Sie mit Dr. Seibt
Genomics Ihr individuelles genetisches Krankheitsrisiko. Mit diesem Wissen
können Sie frühzeitig präventiv handeln und richtig reagieren. Ist es nicht
auch beruhigend zu wissen, welche Krankheiten genetisch ausgeschlossen werden
können?</p>
<p><b>Unsere Hürde</b></p>
<p>Ein Labor mit Hightech-Geräten auszustatten, die in
der Lage sind, zuverlässige, hochpräzise und reproduzierbare Daten zu liefern
und diese von unseren hochqualifizierten Wissenschaftlern analysieren zu
lassen, kostet sehr viel Geld.</p>
<p><b>Unterstützung</b></p>
<p>Für den Firmenstart benötigen wir Ihre finanzielle Unterstützung.
Bitte verbreiten Sie unsere Kampagne bei Ihren Freunden und Bekannten via
Facebook, Twitter, YouTube und weiteren sozialen Medien. Sie werden durch Ihre
Unterstützung exklusiv unsere ersten Kunden und Sie erhalten unsere Leistungen
zu einem günstigeren Preis, der nur hier bei Indiegogo angeboten wird. Ihre
Analyse wird 2015 erfolgen. Sollten wir in 2015 nicht mit der Firma starten
können (was wir nicht hoffen), dann erhalten Sie ihr gespendetes Geld in voller
Höhe zurück.</p>
<p><b>Perks</b></p>
<p>Jede
einzelne Spende zählt und ist uns sehr wichtig, unabhängig von der Höhe. Es zeigt Ihr Interesse an unserem speziellen genetischen Gesundheitsservice. Wir
benötigen Ihre Unterstützung, um die Firma aufzubauen. Unsere genetischen
Untersuchungen gibt es ab 250 € (normaler Preis ab 450 €). Wählen Sie zwischen
unterschiedlichen Gesundheitsmarkern, Krankheiten und Arzneimitteln aus. Wir
untersuchen Ihre DNA daraufhin. Bitte fragen Sie nach Arzneimitteln und
genetischen Krankheiten, die hier nicht aufgelistet sind, da wir diese
möglicherweise ebenfalls untersuchen können.</p>

<br/><h2><b>Resumen Corto – Dr. Seibt
Genomics (Español-Sudamerica)</b></h2>
<p>Su ADN contiene muchas
informaciones importantes sobre su propia salud. Nosotros analizamos su ADN, le
aclaramos cuales son las enfermedades genéticas que usted podría desarrollar
durante su vida y cuáles se puede excluir genéticamente (diagnóstico genético
predictivo). Mediante su ADN le podemos sugerir cuales son los medicamentos que
le hacen efecto a usted y cuales no. Para los medicamentos que le hacen efecto,
adoptamos la dosis individualmente a su ADN (farmacogenómica). Adicionalmente
exploramos (in)tolerancias a los alimentos condicionados genéticamente y
factores de salud genéticos. Una singularidad es la secuenciación del ADN
completo incluyendo análisis y evaluación. Se examina todos los genes,
incluyendo los genes cuales funciones no se ha investigado todavía. Con nuevos
hallazgos de investigación la comparación será más fácil y más rápida sin tener
que hacer un nuevo análisis. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Trasfondo y
metas</b></p>
<p>Seres humanos son diferentes;
algunos son altos, otros chicos, algunos gordos otros flacos. Cada medicamento
impacta de manera diferente a cada ser humano. Una dosis estándar no puede
tener ningún impacto en algunas personas, mientras que para otras puede ser
tóxica. Dejemos la terapia convencional de masas y vamos juntos hacia una
terapia individual hecha a la medida con Dr. Seibt Genomics. La meta es la
mejora de la calidad de vida de cada ser humano. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Su ventaja</b></p>
<p>No pruebe más medicamentos que
no le hagan efecto. No se arriesgue a tomar una sobredosis de algún fármaco. </p>
<p>¿En su familia se repitieron
ciertas enfermedades? Conozca a través de Dr Seibt Genomics el riesgo
individual de tener enfermedades genéticas. Con este conocimiento puede actuar
acertadamente de manera preventiva. En caso que ocurra la enfermedad puede
reaccionar rápidamente y de manera acertada para poder hacerle frente en la
fase del desarrollo. Es tranquilizante también saber cuáles son las
enfermedades que se puede descartar genéticamente durante su vida. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Nuestro obstáculo</b></p>
<p>Nuestro obstáculo es el
financiamiento de un laboratorio con los implementos de alta tecnología, con
los cuales se puede entregar datos confiables y precisos que se puede
reproducir para que puedan ser analizados por nuestros científicos altamente
calificados. </p>
<p><b>Apoyo</b></p>
<p>Para el lanzamiento de la
empresa necesitamos su generosa ayuda financiera y la distribución de esta
campaña entre amigos y conocidos a través de Facebook, Twitter, YouTube y otros
medios sociales. Por su ayuda será uno de nuestros primeros clientes y recibirá
nuestros servicios a un precio menor, que solamente se dará acá en Indiegogo.
Su análisis será realizado a partir de 2015. Si no nos fuera posible de lanzar
la empresa en el transcurso de 2015 (algo que esperemos que no pase) recibirán
la donación completa de vuelta.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Beneficios/Perks</b></p>

Cada donación,
independiente del monto, cuenta. Demuestra su interés en nuestro servicio
genético de salud. Nosotros necesitamos su ayuda para lanzar la compañía. Por
su valiosa donación usted recibirá un análisis genético por el precio especial
de 250 Euros (normalmente a partir de 450 Euros). Usted puede elegir entre
diferentes análisis de genes, enfermedades o medicamentos que pueden ser de
interés para usted. Después de analizar su ADN nosotros le proveemos
informaciones importantes sobre su salud, hecha a la medida basado en su perfil
de ADN. Por favor consulte por medicamentos y enfermedades genéticas que no
encuentre en la lista ya que las podríamos analizar también.<p></p>

Quick Summary (English)
Very important information about your health is hidden in your DNA. We
can decode your DNA to provide
information about your potential health status. Using predictive gene
diagnostics, we can identify
which genetic diseases you are at risk of developing. Furthermore, in pharmacogenomics we can
analyze your DNA to determine which
medications will be most
effective for you, and at what dose. We can also analyze genetic
predispositions to food intolerance and other genetic health factors. Our
special offer is Whole-Genome-Sequencing, including genes of as yet
unknown function. New research results relating to genes, health and disease
can be immediately translated and applied to your genetic profile without
further lab testing.
Background and Aims
We are
different due to our genetic profile or DNA sequence – some of us are tall and
some short, some have blue eyes and others brown eyes. Similarly, our response
to medications may also be different depending
on our DNA. In some people a standard
drug dose may be ineffective,
while in others it may have a
toxic effect. Instead of being reliant on standard medication regimes, our
technology allows for providing specific therapies (personalized medicine) tailored to
individual needs. Our aim is to increase your quality of life.
Your benefit
You can obtain the correct
dose of medication adjusted to your body. Don’t try ineffective
drugs and don’t take the risk of toxicity by
medication. Is there an increased risk of developing specific diseases in your
family? Our technology allows for providing you with a personal risk profile. With this
knowledge you have the option of taking preventive steps or making more
informed choices about your treatment. 
Our barrier
Our barrier is to finance a
laboratory with state-of-the-art technology, which is able to produce reliable,
high-precision and reproducible results, which can be analyzed by our highly
qualified scientists.
Support
To provide this valuable
service we need your financial support. Please share this campaign with your
friends and relatives via Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other social media. As
an expression of gratitude for your support we will offer you genetic analyses at an exclusive
reduced Indiegogo price. We will analyze your samples in 2015. If we are unable
to start our company, your donation will be fully refunded.  
Perks
Every single donation counts,
it doesn’t matter how low or high. It shows us your interest in our genetic
health service. We need your support to start this company. You will receive your
genetic analysis from the special price of 250 Euro (starting at 450 Euro). You can select different
gene analyses, diseases and drugs of interest to you, and after
analyzing your DNA, we can provide you with important health information, which is tailored to your DNA profile. Please ask us for medication
and genetic diseases which are not listed here, because we may also analyze
them.


Where and for
whom is ‘Dr. Seibt Genomics’ service available?

Kurzbeschreibung – 
Dr. Seibt Genomics (Deutsch)
Viele sehr wichtige Informationen über Ihre Gesundheit
liegen in Ihrer DNA verborgen. Wir entschlüsseln dieses Wissen für Sie. Mit der
prädiktiven Gendiagnostik klären wir Sie darüber auf, welche genetischen
Krankheiten Sie erwarten oder verschonen. Anhand Ihrer DNA können wir Ihnen
vorhersagen, welche Arzneimittel bei Ihnen wirken und welche nicht. Außerdem
passen wir mittels Pharmakogenomik die Dosis individuell auf Ihre DNA an.
Zusätzlich untersuchen wir genetisch bedingte Lebensmittel(un)verträglichkeiten
und genetische Gesundheitsfaktoren. Eine Besonderheit ist die gesamte Genomanalyse
inklusive Auswertung, bei der alle Gene untersucht werden, auch diejenigen,
deren Bedeutung heute noch nicht erforscht ist. Bei neuen Forschungsergebnissen
ist ein einfacher und schneller Abgleich, ohne erneute Analyse, möglich.
Hintergrund und Ziele
Menschen sind unterschiedlich - manche sind groß oder
klein, haben blaue oder braune Augen. Wie ein Arzneimittel wirkt ist genauso
unterschiedlich. Eine Standarddosis hat bei manchen Menschen keine Wirkung und
bei anderen bereits eine toxische. Verlassen Sie die übliche Massentherapie und
gehen Sie zusammen mit Dr. Seibt Genomics zur maßgeschneiderten
Individualtherapie über. Unser Ziel ist
die Verbesserung der Lebensqualität eines jeden Menschen.
Ihr Vorteil 
Probieren Sie keine unwirksamen Arzneimittel aus und
liefern Sie sich nicht mehr der Gefahr der Überdosierung aus. Sind in Ihrer
Familie vermehrt bestimmte Krankheiten aufgetreten? Erfahren Sie mit Dr. Seibt
Genomics Ihr individuelles genetisches Krankheitsrisiko. Mit diesem Wissen
können Sie frühzeitig präventiv handeln und richtig reagieren. Ist es nicht
auch beruhigend zu wissen, welche Krankheiten genetisch ausgeschlossen werden
können?
Unsere Hürde
Ein Labor mit Hightech-Geräten auszustatten, die in
der Lage sind, zuverlässige, hochpräzise und reproduzierbare Daten zu liefern
und diese von unseren hochqualifizierten Wissenschaftlern analysieren zu
lassen, kostet sehr viel Geld.
Unterstützung
Für den Firmenstart benötigen wir Ihre finanzielle Unterstützung.
Bitte verbreiten Sie unsere Kampagne bei Ihren Freunden und Bekannten via
Facebook, Twitter, YouTube und weiteren sozialen Medien. Sie werden durch Ihre
Unterstützung exklusiv unsere ersten Kunden und Sie erhalten unsere Leistungen
zu einem günstigeren Preis, der nur hier bei Indiegogo angeboten wird. Ihre
Analyse wird 2015 erfolgen. Sollten wir in 2015 nicht mit der Firma starten
können (was wir nicht hoffen), dann erhalten Sie ihr gespendetes Geld in voller
Höhe zurück.
Perks
Jede
einzelne Spende zählt und ist uns sehr wichtig, unabhängig von der Höhe. Es zeigt Ihr Interesse an unserem speziellen genetischen Gesundheitsservice. Wir
benötigen Ihre Unterstützung, um die Firma aufzubauen. Unsere genetischen
Untersuchungen gibt es ab 250 € (normaler Preis ab 450 €). Wählen Sie zwischen
unterschiedlichen Gesundheitsmarkern, Krankheiten und Arzneimitteln aus. Wir
untersuchen Ihre DNA daraufhin. Bitte fragen Sie nach Arzneimitteln und
genetischen Krankheiten, die hier nicht aufgelistet sind, da wir diese
möglicherweise ebenfalls untersuchen können.

Resumen Corto – Dr. Seibt
Genomics (Español-Sudamerica)
Su ADN contiene muchas
informaciones importantes sobre su propia salud. Nosotros analizamos su ADN, le
aclaramos cuales son las enfermedades genéticas que usted podría desarrollar
durante su vida y cuáles se puede excluir genéticamente (diagnóstico genético
predictivo). Mediante su ADN le podemos sugerir cuales son los medicamentos que
le hacen efecto a usted y cuales no. Para los medicamentos que le hacen efecto,
adoptamos la dosis individualmente a su ADN (farmacogenómica). Adicionalmente
exploramos (in)tolerancias a los alimentos condicionados genéticamente y
factores de salud genéticos. Una singularidad es la secuenciación del ADN
completo incluyendo análisis y evaluación. Se examina todos los genes,
incluyendo los genes cuales funciones no se ha investigado todavía. Con nuevos
hallazgos de investigación la comparación será más fácil y más rápida sin tener
que hacer un nuevo análisis. 

Trasfondo y
metas
Seres humanos son diferentes;
algunos son altos, otros chicos, algunos gordos otros flacos. Cada medicamento
impacta de manera diferente a cada ser humano. Una dosis estándar no puede
tener ningún impacto en algunas personas, mientras que para otras puede ser
tóxica. Dejemos la terapia convencional de masas y vamos juntos hacia una
terapia individual hecha a la medida con Dr. Seibt Genomics. La meta es la
mejora de la calidad de vida de cada ser humano. 

Su ventaja
No pruebe más medicamentos que
no le hagan efecto. No se arriesgue a tomar una sobredosis de algún fármaco. 
¿En su familia se repitieron
ciertas enfermedades? Conozca a través de Dr Seibt Genomics el riesgo
individual de tener enfermedades genéticas. Con este conocimiento puede actuar
acertadamente de manera preventiva. En caso que ocurra la enfermedad puede
reaccionar rápidamente y de manera acertada para poder hacerle frente en la
fase del desarrollo. Es tranquilizante también saber cuáles son las
enfermedades que se puede descartar genéticamente durante su vida. 

Nuestro obstáculo
Nuestro obstáculo es el
financiamiento de un laboratorio con los implementos de alta tecnología, con
los cuales se puede entregar datos confiables y precisos que se puede
reproducir para que puedan ser analizados por nuestros científicos altamente
calificados. 
Apoyo
Para el lanzamiento de la
empresa necesitamos su generosa ayuda financiera y la distribución de esta
campaña entre amigos y conocidos a través de Facebook, Twitter, YouTube y otros
medios sociales. Por su ayuda será uno de nuestros primeros clientes y recibirá
nuestros servicios a un precio menor, que solamente se dará acá en Indiegogo.
Su análisis será realizado a partir de 2015. Si no nos fuera posible de lanzar
la empresa en el transcurso de 2015 (algo que esperemos que no pase) recibirán
la donación completa de vuelta.

Beneficios/Perks

Cada donación,
independiente del monto, cuenta. Demuestra su interés en nuestro servicio
genético de salud. Nosotros necesitamos su ayuda para lanzar la compañía. Por
su valiosa donación usted recibirá un análisis genético por el precio especial
de 250 Euros (normalmente a partir de 450 Euros). Usted puede elegir entre
diferentes análisis de genes, enfermedades o medicamentos que pueden ser de
interés para usted. Después de analizar su ADN nosotros le proveemos
informaciones importantes sobre su salud, hecha a la medida basado en su perfil
de ADN. Por favor consulte por medicamentos y enfermedades genéticas que no
encuentre en la lista ya que las podríamos analizar también.

</p><p><strong>Humble
Beginnings…</strong></p>
<p>Many
people have asked, how did you come up with the idea for Rather Lather?
Actually, the origin of Rather Lather Soap Creations came from my grandmother.
Grandma Susie, as she was affectionately called, was quite resourceful and
resilient. Born in 1908, she lived to be nearly 101 years old, before passing
away in August 2009. She and I were extremely close, and she imparted a lot of
wisdom, knowledge and creativity to me during her lifetime. One of her most
remarkable skills was her ingenuity. She reused, recycled and repurposed
household items long before it became known as “going green.” When I asked her
how she survived the Great Depression, Grandma Susie’s response was, “What
depression? We were already depressed. It was just another day, as I recall.”</p>
<p>Full
of Mother Wit and keen insightfulness, Grandma Susie didn’t believe in wasting
things. She would take soap scraps or pieces, and store them in an old Mason
jar under the bathroom sink. She’d add a little water, and eventually, the soap
pieces would soften and partially liquefy. She’d add a little to our bath
water, creating a makeshift bubble bath. It didn’t quite have the same bubbly
effect or the same pretty packaging as my preferred Mr. Bubbles, but it was
better than nothing.</p>
<p><b>Everything Old
is New Again…</b></p>
<p>I
grew up looking at that jar, and was often repulsed by its unsightliness. It
just looked icky, and moreover, anyone who saw it always wondered what the heck
it was. So, to avoid any explanations or looks of disgust, I slyly moved the
jar to the rear corner of the cramped bathroom cabinet, and hoped that my
grandmother wouldn’t notice. Thankfully, she eventually forgot about it. And
over the years, my memories of that hideous jar filled with globs of
multi-colored soap pieces and murky water were also forgotten.</p>
<p>However,
the inspiration behind this was never forgotten. One day, while brainstorming
new ideas with my business partner, Danielle, we talked about how the world was
changing, and how green products and services were the new trend. Having become
more eco-conscious myself, I thought about how repurposing things was just
about being more conscientious. I glanced over, and saw the picture of my
grandmother’s hands, and the thought of her old soap jar suddenly came to mind.
At that moment, the idea of Rather Lather was born. Instantly, we
started discussing and researching existing methods for recycling soap
pieces. The internet was filled with crafty ideas and homespun methods. But
nothing like what we envisioned. We were determined to develop a more
attractive, fun and inspiring way to reuse these soap pieces so that everyone
would find it appealing. And we did. These are the humble beginnings of Rather
Lather Soap Creations. And my Grandma Susie would be so proud!</p>
<p><b>Help Us Make
“Going Green the New Black!”</b></p>
<p>Now
comes the real challenge. Getting the word out. To the eco-friendly and those
becoming more eco-conscious. And we really appreciate you taking the time to
visit our website. Please tell ten friends! We are committed to creating
products that will become part of your daily routine. Granted, we
feel that our name is pretty memorable, however, we’ve also created a jingle
that we hope you will also find just as memorable… and catchy. Please scroll down to hear our jingle…</p><p> and soon you’ll
say, <i>“I’d Rather Lather!”</i></p>
<p>Thanks
for your support,</p>

</p><p><strong>      GREEN IS NOT ONLY ECO-FREIENDLY, IT'S ECONOMICALLY FRIENDLY</strong><strong>!</strong> </p>
<p>Everyday,
consumers use millions of bars of soap around the world. From the most

</div></div>","OUR STORY                                               ""From the Teaching Hands of our Elders""
Humble
Beginnings…
Many
people have asked, how did you come up with the idea for Rather Lather?
Actually, the origin of Rather Lather Soap Creations came from my grandmother.
Grandma Susie, as she was affectionately called, was quite resourceful and
resilient. Born in 1908, she lived to be nearly 101 years old, before passing
away in August 2009. She and I were extremely close, and she imparted a lot of
wisdom, knowledge and creativity to me during her lifetime. One of her most
remarkable skills was her ingenuity. She reused, recycled and repurposed
household items long before it became known as “going green.” When I asked her
how she survived the Great Depression, Grandma Susie’s response was, “What
depression? We were already depressed. It was just another day, as I recall.”
Full
of Mother Wit and keen insightfulness, Grandma Susie didn’t believe in wasting
things. She would take soap scraps or pieces, and store them in an old Mason
jar under the bathroom sink. She’d add a little water, and eventually, the soap
pieces would soften and partially liquefy. She’d add a little to our bath
water, creating a makeshift bubble bath. It didn’t quite have the same bubbly
effect or the same pretty packaging as my preferred Mr. Bubbles, but it was
better than nothing.
Everything Old
is New Again…
I
grew up looking at that jar, and was often repulsed by its unsightliness. It
just looked icky, and moreover, anyone who saw it always wondered what the heck
it was. So, to avoid any explanations or looks of disgust, I slyly moved the
jar to the rear corner of the cramped bathroom cabinet, and hoped that my
grandmother wouldn’t notice. Thankfully, she eventually forgot about it. And
over the years, my memories of that hideous jar filled with globs of
multi-colored soap pieces and murky water were also forgotten.
However,
the inspiration behind this was never forgotten. One day, while brainstorming
new ideas with my business partner, Danielle, we talked about how the world was
changing, and how green products and services were the new trend. Having become
more eco-conscious myself, I thought about how repurposing things was just
about being more conscientious. I glanced over, and saw the picture of my
grandmother’s hands, and the thought of her old soap jar suddenly came to mind.
At that moment, the idea of Rather Lather was born. Instantly, we
started discussing and researching existing methods for recycling soap
pieces. The internet was filled with crafty ideas and homespun methods. But
nothing like what we envisioned. We were determined to develop a more
attractive, fun and inspiring way to reuse these soap pieces so that everyone
would find it appealing. And we did. These are the humble beginnings of Rather
Lather Soap Creations. And my Grandma Susie would be so proud!
Help Us Make
“Going Green the New Black!”
Now
comes the real challenge. Getting the word out. To the eco-friendly and those
becoming more eco-conscious. And we really appreciate you taking the time to
visit our website. Please tell ten friends! We are committed to creating
products that will become part of your daily routine. Granted, we
feel that our name is pretty memorable, however, we’ve also created a jingle
that we hope you will also find just as memorable… and catchy. Please scroll down to hear our jingle… and soon you’ll
say, “I’d Rather Lather!”
Thanks
for your support,

PRODUCT DEMONSTRATION VIDEO    NEVER BE WITHOUT SOAP AGAIN... WITH RATHER LATHER!
     We’ve
created the Rather Lather Soap Creations kit, a patent pending product that converts soap scraps into luxuriously, rich lathering hand soap in minutes!
The process will revolutionize the health and beauty care industry because there is nothing else like it on the market! It's so simple and easy that anyone can do it!
We are embarking
on the future wave of eco-friendly soap products!

      GREEN IS NOT ONLY ECO-FREIENDLY, IT'S ECONOMICALLY FRIENDLY! 
Everyday,
consumers use millions of bars of soap around the world. From the most
expensive to the most economic. Regardless of cost, consumers use them
until they are a mere sliver of its former self, in an effort to get the most out of each bar.  Afterwards, those slivers are usually regarded as useless
and usually discarded.                                        GOING GREEN IS THE NEW BLACK!
It's easy to become more eco-conscious. In these harsh 
economic times, and as resources become scarcer, consumers are becoming more
conscientious with their spending and concerned about the environment. That’s why we’ve developed a line of
economical. eco-friendly products that reduce waste and encourage recycling.
                            
HEY KIDS...THIS IS JUST FOR YOU!We want to get kids involved in conserving their
planet, for their generation, as well as future generations to come. We have a
fun and exciting eco-friendly product line for kids under development that kids
will love! It too, is unlike anything else on the market. Kids will be begging
to wash their hands and bathe, just to use our products! 
Meet our mascot…                                                 
                                                                                                      DC GREEN FESTIVAL EXHIBIT
                         

We’re a
partnership that is eco-friendly, earth-conscious, and overall committed to
making a positive impact on our world. Our goal is to have everyone using our
products... and enthusiastically say, “I’d Rather Lather!""
Our mission
is to introduce the Rather Lather Soap Creations kit to the masses, as well as the
many other eco-friendly products coming down the pipeline. We make quality products that appeal to everyone; not just the eco-friendly!
Appropriation of Funds:Being the first to market, we have to establish product recognition, quality and value to create brand loyalty. Therefore, any future competitors will have a difficult time challenging our products.  Marketing
& Promotion

To broaden our Brand product visibility via an aggressive marketing and
promotion campaign.  
With
a new product, introducing a never before seen concept, it is essential that we
develop and complete a professional, informative, high quality product
demonstration video. We feel that producing an informative commercial would best display our product. 

To reach the largest possible market, we want to use the most effective
media tools available (television and internet)! 

It
is critical that we attend the largest Eco Exhibition in the country this year; South by
Southwest (SXSW) to reach an audience of global sustainability
experts and leaders.

Inventory

We
need to purchase additional inventory to prepare for the sales increase we hope
to generate as a result of this campaign and the awareness it raises.
As
a small company, we do not have the funds to employ a sales support team which
is greatly needed, since we ultimately want to get our products in the hands of
major retailers. We are currently selling our products online on our website at
www.rlsoaps.com.



 Let's make this product the global success we know it can be! This is where we'll be in the future with the help of our Rock Stars!

<h3>Hi, I'm Jennifer, Derek's sister.  I created this page to try and help raise some money for Derek to help pay his medical bills from his recent surgery and on-going expenses such as physical therapy.  It is my hope that we can at least get him $3,000 to help with these expenses.  They do not know when Derek can return to work, so any financial support we can give them will help tremendously.  (And your body heals better when you're less stressed, and we all know what the stress of money can do to us.)</h3>
<p>Here's some background info on all Derek's been through, for those of you who don't know the details:</p>
<p><em><span class=""il"">Derek</span> was born with, a Coarctation of the Aorta Artery,( a narrowing of part of the aorta artery, causing high blood pressure on the top of his body, and low pressure on the bottom; the normal- should be the same pressure)  He was also born with a Bicuspid Aorta Valve, and a Prolasped Mitral Valve.  The Bicuspid valve has two leaflets, instead of the normal valve which have three. The valve had a leak, but was functioning.</em><br/><br/><em> At age three, <span class=""il"">Derek</span> had heart surgery to repair the coarctation of the aorta artery, they removed the narrowed section.</em><br/><br/><em> At age 16, scar tissue had built up in the artery, causing blood pressure problems again. Second surgery was, an artificial aorta artery put in to by pass the coarctation of the original artery.  The two heart valves  continued to function, so they were left alone.</em><br/><br/><em> At age 36, doctors found a 7.5cm aortic artery aneurysm.  Surgery to by pass from his carotid artery to the left brachiad artery to his left arm.( this had to be done before, so blood flow would go to <span class=""il"">Derek</span>'s left arm during surgery to get to the aneurysm) A stent was put in <span class=""il"">Derek</span>'s carotid artery, and also, a stent in the artificial aorta artery. After that procedure, surgery to cut off all blood flow to the aneurysm, using a plug of some sort! I am sure there is a medical term for it, but we called it a plug.</em><br/><br/><em> At age 37, plug did not seal off all of the blood flow to the aneurysm, it continued to grow. Nothing left to do, but go in through the chest. Pre surgery tests done, showed <span class=""il"">Derek</span>'s Aortic Valve had a serious leak, and needed to be replaced!  Open heart surgery ( 10 hours) to have a valve replacement and cut off all blood flow to the original aorta artery. Also, another carotid artery by pass done.  They checked on his Mitral Valve, said it was wiggly, but functioning and not leaking at this time. They will keep and eye on it.   <span class=""il"">Derek</span>'s new aorta valve is a mechanical valve, due to his age. It should last his lifetime!</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>So as you can see, he is a trooper and no stranger to recovering.  He is currently recovering nicely, but deals with a good amount of pain on a regular basis.  The physical therapy helps and will keep on helping, but it is costly as well.  Lets all pull together and give him a cushion to soften the blow to all of those bills!</p>

Since it was discovered in the very early stages, i have pretty much a 100% chance of beating this. I know there are no sure things in life other than death and taxes, but I also know a strong and positive attitude is one of the greatest keys to good health and recovery, so I am continuing to live in that mode. The reason I started this campaign is to help defray some of the expenses that will be associated with my fight. I am working again for the first time since June of 2011, but it is part time (about 15-20 hours per week), and I have no health insurance. My HIV care is paid for by a non-profit organization, but since the cancer isn't HIV related, they don't cover those costs. My doctor is about an hour south of me in Vero Beach, and I'll probably have to make some trips into Orlando for care as well, and I drive a gas hog, so your help will go towards time lost from work for care, gas to get me to my care, and any other help I may need that my already compromised immune system decides to throw my way. I promise to keep you all updated on my treatment and health so you know that your support is working. I don't know what else to say other than thanks for taking the time to read this, and extra special gratitude and thanks to you if you can help. Cheers!</h3>

</div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>Fortunately there are few barriers The Milwaukee Bubblers anticipate having to hurdle. That
having been said, we'd like to be as transparent as possible. So, here are the
possible challenges we want everyone to be aware of.</p>
<p><b>First: Our Balls. </b><br/>
We like to think that we've got the biggest and best ball (suits) in the country,
however since they are currently manufactured overseas there is always the chance that delivery could be stalled or arrive in poor condition.  We anticipated for this and have already ordered a set of adult ball suits, so when game time comes,  we'll be prepared with extras (just in case). We are
also working with MSOE faculty to create special projects for the students to
work on our suits. We're looking forward to seeing what the creative young minds at MSOE can design!</p>
<p><b>Second Potential
Challenge: Too Many People Want to Play With Our Balls. <br/></b>
It's not very often that this is a concern, but when your balls are as
expensive and specialized as ours, you need to be careful with them. We are
currently planning for two primary types of bubble play: Tournament and private rental.
Since our ball suits have an actual life/usage span, we are aware that if we become
too popular, our balls will wear out.  To address with problem, we have rolled the
cost of ball replacement and staffing into the overall cost of tournament play
and rental costs. We want to stay affordable and competitive, but we also need
to make sure we have the capital necessary to ensure consistent and healthy
play. By partnering with MSOE, we're also hoping to develop stronger, more affordable bubble suits to make the game even more affordable and fun!</p>
<p><b>Third Possible Hiccup:
Not Enough People Want to Play With Our Balls. <br/></b>
Sometimes, even if people say they want to get involved, they will forget to
sign up, have conflicts or simply won't have the means to
secure a private rental. To encourage local and regional Bubble Play, we have
partnered with WMSE 91.7fm. They will be working with
us on marketing and promotion. We will provide introductory discounts as we roll out our brand and support student and
veteran discounts to help with those on a tighter budget.  Physical activity and social interaction are powerful tools to staying healthy, we want to do what we can to keep Milwaukee Bubblers accessible to the general population. We're also integrating lower cost ""drop-in"" games throughout Southern Wisconsin to provide a time and cost effective option.</p>

balls rolling by teaming up with ... 


The Lowlands Restaurant Group (Cafe Hollander, Cafe Centraal, Cafe Benelux, Trocadero and Bavaria) 
WMSE 91.7fm ""Community Powered Radio"" 

Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE) Kern Athletic Center 


We are honored to have earned the trust of these local businesses. These community
partnerships will provide stability and strength to our programming.  The Lowlands Group allows us regular and affordable post gaming social space throughout the Greater Milwaukee area and into Madison, WI and Mequon, WI by 2015. They are also generously donating space, food and beverages to our Gala Event on October 29th at Café Benelux (see rewards to the right to purchase your tickets now...quantities limited)Having WMSE 91.7fm as a partner is so exciting!  Co-branding on events and having access to marketing experts (radio, print and social media) will grow our visibility and brand dramatically.  We're thrilled to have the Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE) as one of our Founding Partners! 
The MSOE Kern Athletic Center, a state of the art athletic complex nestled in the MSOE campus, is going to be ""home base"" for quarterly tournaments, winter drop-in games and will provide a unique opportunity connect with students.  The Kern Center is also generously providing the space we need to host our Inaugural Tournament on October 29th (tickets available n the rewards section to the right).   We are also getting ready to partner with MSOE professors to provide exciting ""real-world"" classroom projects and internship opportunities as well.
  
Risks & Challenges  
Fortunately there are few barriers The Milwaukee Bubblers anticipate having to hurdle. That
having been said, we'd like to be as transparent as possible. So, here are the
possible challenges we want everyone to be aware of.
First: Our Balls. 
We like to think that we've got the biggest and best ball (suits) in the country,
however since they are currently manufactured overseas there is always the chance that delivery could be stalled or arrive in poor condition.  We anticipated for this and have already ordered a set of adult ball suits, so when game time comes,  we'll be prepared with extras (just in case). We are
also working with MSOE faculty to create special projects for the students to
work on our suits. We're looking forward to seeing what the creative young minds at MSOE can design!
Second Potential
Challenge: Too Many People Want to Play With Our Balls. 
It's not very often that this is a concern, but when your balls are as
expensive and specialized as ours, you need to be careful with them. We are
currently planning for two primary types of bubble play: Tournament and private rental.
Since our ball suits have an actual life/usage span, we are aware that if we become
too popular, our balls will wear out.  To address with problem, we have rolled the
cost of ball replacement and staffing into the overall cost of tournament play
and rental costs. We want to stay affordable and competitive, but we also need
to make sure we have the capital necessary to ensure consistent and healthy
play. By partnering with MSOE, we're also hoping to develop stronger, more affordable bubble suits to make the game even more affordable and fun!
Third Possible Hiccup:
Not Enough People Want to Play With Our Balls. 
Sometimes, even if people say they want to get involved, they will forget to
sign up, have conflicts or simply won't have the means to
secure a private rental. To encourage local and regional Bubble Play, we have
partnered with WMSE 91.7fm. They will be working with
us on marketing and promotion. We will provide introductory discounts as we roll out our brand and support student and
veteran discounts to help with those on a tighter budget.  Physical activity and social interaction are powerful tools to staying healthy, we want to do what we can to keep Milwaukee Bubblers accessible to the general population. We're also integrating lower cost ""drop-in"" games throughout Southern Wisconsin to provide a time and cost effective option.

  WHAT CAN YOU DO?

EVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS!

While money goes a long way to pay the bills, we also need people to spread the word about what we're doing and are always in need of volunteers to help us with charity and outreach events.  If you are available to help or would like to get more involved, email us right away!

<p></p><p>My name is <b>Jon Fernandez</b>. I am a
28 year software developer, and my goal is to make software development, in
general, easier, faster, and less costly. What would it mean for us as
consumers if software was simpler to develop? If important software took less
time to create, wouldn't you expect new applications to arrive sooner, and do
more than a product that was rushed to market? Companies might balk at the idea
of developing a four year project that they might consider if it only took two years.
If software takes less time to create, maybe we will all see new and better
applications that do more than they would have otherwise.</p><p>
</p><p>I've spent over five years developing this system, called
FIOSys (File Input Output System), <strong>a software developer's tool</strong>. It is finished now and ready to develop an
advanced prototype for, so that we can demonstrate for other developers and
investors its market readiness. We are asking for your help to develop this
prototype so that we can demonstrate the benefits of incorporating FIOSys as
the foundation for all new software development.</p><p>
<b>What is a prototype?</b> A prototype is like a real life software
application we create in-house that uses FIOSys to handle its work. The FIOSys
prototype will act like an airline reservation system, with customers trying
to reserve seating for airplanes that must be filled before they can take off.
FIOSys manages the entire system, handling conflicts when multiple customers
want the same seat, when the system goes down, and any other need that a robust
reservation system requires. With this prototype, we can demonstrate to other
developers how using FIOSys can speed up and enhance their own development
efforts with the applications they are trying to create.</p><p><strong>You might be tempted to think that FIOSys has nothing to do with you?</strong> Did you use a computer today,
a smart phone, mp3 player, or a tablet? Did you look up the news online, check email,
or send a text? Consider that almost everything you see is ""smart""
now - from going through the checkout register at a store, while visiting your
doctor, to just about everything you do at work. Cars are even starting to
drive themselves. Technology changes so fast, that it's hard to imagine
what tomorrow will look like. Innovative software is what makes it all happen.<br/></p><p>
</p><p></p><hr/><h3>What is the potential impact of FIOSys?</h3><p></p><p>
</p><p>The promise of FIOSys is that new
software development could forever change. FIOSys seeks to become a standard,
so that all significant new software development starts with FIOSys as the
foundation. The lure for doing this is twofold.</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<b>Eliminate
     years of future software development time.</b> What would it mean for a
     tech company to get their products out to market sooner, and those
     products were better and more reliable? It means less risk for the
     company, and more time to add the features into their products that would
     make them outstanding.</li>
<li>
<strong>Encourage standardization.</strong> If more and more applications use FIOSys, they are in a position to ""talk"" to each other more easily. This could mean that software we are proficient with can be used in more and more ways. It could mean we as consumers don't have to continuously learn new software that does something we already know how to do. It could mean the easing of frustrating incompatibility issues between old and new software, and between different types of software. FIOSys can improve the ability, for all of us, to share applications and data more fluidly.</li>
</ol><p>
</p><p></p><hr/><h3>Video Presentation</h3><p></p>

<hr/><h3>What we need funding for</h3><p></p>
<p>Primarily we need funding to
create the FIOSys prototype. This prototype will demonstrate the readiness of
FIOSys for the market and illustrate what FIOSys can do. An additional benefit
of this prototype is as a high speed testing platform that stresses the
underlying system in a way that ensures and promotes its robustness in a high
pressure environment. To accomplish this, we need funding for:</p>
<ol>
<li>High
     end <b>computer</b> equipment to enhance prototype development and create
     high definition video presentations.</li>
<li>
<b>Development
     Time</b> so that the team can dedicate all its resources to this effort.</li>
<li>
<b>A
     patent</b> - primarily to protect us from someone else trying to say that
     ""they got here first"" and obstruct FIOSys's expansion into the
     market.</li>
<li>
<b>FIOSys
     Promotion</b>. A vigorous Crowd Funding campaign will put us in contact
     with many developers. An adequate budget to connect with the right people
     at the right time could be crucial.</li>
</ol><p>
</p><p>
</p><hr/><h3>What else could we use funding for?</h3><p></p>
<p>Beyond creation of a prototype,
equipment, and a patent - we could use additional donations for many purposes.
With more funds, we can <b>hire programmer(s)</b> to help bring FIOSys to
market. There are three additional tasks that need to be developed for
this.</p>
<ol>
<li>A
     <b>developer's application</b> that shows the developer what's going on
     behind the curtain, so that they can see what they are doing and that they
     are using FIOsys correctly.</li>
<li>An
     <b>Administrator application</b>. For large business (enterprise) users,
     an admin app is necessary to setup user and file access rights, so that
     proper personnel have the desired rights to the company's data. This
     application can also be used to monitor what files are in use and by whom,
     and what activities are being performed.</li>
<li>A
     <b>support website</b> - complete with tutorials, walkthroughs, sample
     applications, guides, and a forum so that developers can find the
     information they need to quickly and efficiently utilize FIOSys.</li>
</ol><p>The next step if we obtain even
more funding, would be to grow the FIOSys company. It will take a concerted
effort to reach out to other companies small and large, to encourage them to
base their development efforts on FIOSys. Especially larger arenas like
government, medical, science, research, and business, will all take a
significant amount of outreach to seriously consider the benefits of what
FIOSys can do for them.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p><hr/><h3>Funding Rewards</h3><p></p>
<p>Most likely the FIOSys model will be similar to
technologies like Adobe Flash and PDF - which are given away free to the
consumer (but not the developers). Beyond our undying gratitude for your
helping us change the world, what can we give you that you won't receive for
free anyway? Fortunately, there are certain awards we can provide you in token
of our appreciation (you can remain anonymous if you wish).</p><p>

</p></div>","What is FIOSys?
My name is Jon Fernandez. I am a
28 year software developer, and my goal is to make software development, in
general, easier, faster, and less costly. What would it mean for us as
consumers if software was simpler to develop? If important software took less
time to create, wouldn't you expect new applications to arrive sooner, and do
more than a product that was rushed to market? Companies might balk at the idea
of developing a four year project that they might consider if it only took two years.
If software takes less time to create, maybe we will all see new and better
applications that do more than they would have otherwise.
I've spent over five years developing this system, called
FIOSys (File Input Output System), a software developer's tool. It is finished now and ready to develop an
advanced prototype for, so that we can demonstrate for other developers and
investors its market readiness. We are asking for your help to develop this
prototype so that we can demonstrate the benefits of incorporating FIOSys as
the foundation for all new software development.
What is a prototype? A prototype is like a real life software
application we create in-house that uses FIOSys to handle its work. The FIOSys
prototype will act like an airline reservation system, with customers trying
to reserve seating for airplanes that must be filled before they can take off.
FIOSys manages the entire system, handling conflicts when multiple customers
want the same seat, when the system goes down, and any other need that a robust
reservation system requires. With this prototype, we can demonstrate to other
developers how using FIOSys can speed up and enhance their own development
efforts with the applications they are trying to create.You might be tempted to think that FIOSys has nothing to do with you? Did you use a computer today,
a smart phone, mp3 player, or a tablet? Did you look up the news online, check email,
or send a text? Consider that almost everything you see is ""smart""
now - from going through the checkout register at a store, while visiting your
doctor, to just about everything you do at work. Cars are even starting to
drive themselves. Technology changes so fast, that it's hard to imagine
what tomorrow will look like. Innovative software is what makes it all happen.
What is the potential impact of FIOSys?
The promise of FIOSys is that new
software development could forever change. FIOSys seeks to become a standard,
so that all significant new software development starts with FIOSys as the
foundation. The lure for doing this is twofold.


Eliminate
     years of future software development time. What would it mean for a
     tech company to get their products out to market sooner, and those
     products were better and more reliable? It means less risk for the
     company, and more time to add the features into their products that would
     make them outstanding.

Encourage standardization. If more and more applications use FIOSys, they are in a position to ""talk"" to each other more easily. This could mean that software we are proficient with can be used in more and more ways. It could mean we as consumers don't have to continuously learn new software that does something we already know how to do. It could mean the easing of frustrating incompatibility issues between old and new software, and between different types of software. FIOSys can improve the ability, for all of us, to share applications and data more fluidly.

Video Presentation
We have created seven videos to
explain clearly what we're trying to accomplish and the potential for this
technology.


Introduction
     (5 minutes): This is an explanation of FIOSys - what it is and what it seeks to accomplish.



Benefits
     (3 minutes): What are the primary benefits that FIOSys provides?




Standardization
     (4 minutes): One of the primary goals for FIOSys is to encourage
     standardization in the software industry. Why is standardization so
     important, and is it even possible?




Software development takes time (4 minutes): You may not realize how long it takes to create new and important software. We can change this.




Why
     me? Why files? (4 minutes): Enhanced file handling has been my world for 28 years. Why am I suited for this effort, and why is this so important to me?




The
     Team (2 minutes): The FIOSys team has over five decades of experience developing retail software, and building and supporting small business.




Technical
     Overview (18 minutes): If you prefer a technical approach, this may be the one and only video you need to watch to fully understand what FIOSys does and its potential (this video was created in low definition, so is better watched at its current size on this page).


What we need funding for
Primarily we need funding to
create the FIOSys prototype. This prototype will demonstrate the readiness of
FIOSys for the market and illustrate what FIOSys can do. An additional benefit
of this prototype is as a high speed testing platform that stresses the
underlying system in a way that ensures and promotes its robustness in a high
pressure environment. To accomplish this, we need funding for:

High
     end computer equipment to enhance prototype development and create
     high definition video presentations.

Development
     Time so that the team can dedicate all its resources to this effort.

A
     patent - primarily to protect us from someone else trying to say that
     ""they got here first"" and obstruct FIOSys's expansion into the
     market.

FIOSys
     Promotion. A vigorous Crowd Funding campaign will put us in contact
     with many developers. An adequate budget to connect with the right people
     at the right time could be crucial.


What else could we use funding for?
Beyond creation of a prototype,
equipment, and a patent - we could use additional donations for many purposes.
With more funds, we can hire programmer(s) to help bring FIOSys to
market. There are three additional tasks that need to be developed for
this.

A
     developer's application that shows the developer what's going on
     behind the curtain, so that they can see what they are doing and that they
     are using FIOsys correctly.
An
     Administrator application. For large business (enterprise) users,
     an admin app is necessary to setup user and file access rights, so that
     proper personnel have the desired rights to the company's data. This
     application can also be used to monitor what files are in use and by whom,
     and what activities are being performed.
A
     support website - complete with tutorials, walkthroughs, sample
     applications, guides, and a forum so that developers can find the
     information they need to quickly and efficiently utilize FIOSys.
The next step if we obtain even
more funding, would be to grow the FIOSys company. It will take a concerted
effort to reach out to other companies small and large, to encourage them to
base their development efforts on FIOSys. Especially larger arenas like
government, medical, science, research, and business, will all take a

Most likely the FIOSys model will be similar to
technologies like Adobe Flash and PDF - which are given away free to the
consumer (but not the developers). Beyond our undying gratitude for your
helping us change the world, what can we give you that you won't receive for

<p></p>
<p>What the Money is for~</p>
<p>1. Registration of a non profit association in Mexico City to enable Carolina to make this simple and inexpensive technology available to the most deprived corners of Mexico.  With the help of generous and open minded people, Get Mobile Enterprises will reach its goals to help others in all parts of the world.  </p>
<p>$10,000</p>
<p>2. Design and making of Production Molds for the Super Mini Mobilizer and the Mini Mobilizer, which will be made  made primarily of durable plastic and aluminum the production of accessories and educational materials that will accompany it. </p>
<p>$10.000 </p>
<p>3. Company international Liability insurance.</p>
<p>$10,000 annually</p>
<p>4.  UL approval is the equivalent of CSA approval for the USA.  We require UL approval for the Mobilizer 1 and we require CSA and UL approval for the Super Mini Mobilizer and the Mini Mobilizer.</p>
<p>$10,000</p>
<p>5.  Web Master to design and maintain the Get Mobile site to enable us to provide support for those individuals and their families who are already using our products and easy access for those who want to attain more information or to purchase any of our products.</p>
<p>$5,000</p>
<p>6. Funding for full time administration, legal documentation and distribution for equipment available through Get Mobile Enterprises.</p>
<p>$25,000</p>
<p>7. Funds to help launch the 1st production run of the Mini Mobilizer which will óaccommodate children from approximately 12 - 24 months of age.  This will give these young children an opportunity to encourage and maintain proper body alignment. build muscle mass and support a healthier immune system because of the circulation this system enhances in the body.  The use of the Super Mini Mobilizer  allows caregivers to focus on the the problem the child has been diagnosed with, rather than the unknown complications that come with lack of movement and circulation.  Some examples of such complications are future hip and tendon operations, atrophied muscles, contracting of the muscles and additional medical complications with the immune system and general poor health.</p>
<p>$10,000</p>
<p>8.  Attain ISO 13485 level two custom system certification program certificate.  This program certificate verifies that the Company has passed all the necessary requirements to allow it to produce the Mobilizer 1, as well as future products that can be sold internationally as motorized pieces of medical equipment.  This would allow the Mobilizer 1 to be used in hospital settings.  At this time the Mobilizer 1 is CSA approved and Get Mobile Enterprises holds a patent in both Canada and the USA.</p>
<p>$70,000 </p>
<p>9. Fulfill our promise to donate a Mobilizer 1 to one Canadian and one American Veterans Rehabilitation Hospital to help support  those who have so bravely protected their Countries. (Each Mobilizer 1 has the value of $27,000)</p>
<p>Cost of Production</p>

These vouchers suitable for donations to your local community/rehabilitation center honor others if you wish to be honored Buddhism!



What the Money is for~
1. Registration of a non profit association in Mexico City to enable Carolina to make this simple and inexpensive technology available to the most deprived corners of Mexico.  With the help of generous and open minded people, Get Mobile Enterprises will reach its goals to help others in all parts of the world.  
$10,000
2. Design and making of Production Molds for the Super Mini Mobilizer and the Mini Mobilizer, which will be made  made primarily of durable plastic and aluminum the production of accessories and educational materials that will accompany it. 
$10.000 
3. Company international Liability insurance.
$10,000 annually
4.  UL approval is the equivalent of CSA approval for the USA.  We require UL approval for the Mobilizer 1 and we require CSA and UL approval for the Super Mini Mobilizer and the Mini Mobilizer.
$10,000
5.  Web Master to design and maintain the Get Mobile site to enable us to provide support for those individuals and their families who are already using our products and easy access for those who want to attain more information or to purchase any of our products.
$5,000
6. Funding for full time administration, legal documentation and distribution for equipment available through Get Mobile Enterprises.
$25,000
7. Funds to help launch the 1st production run of the Mini Mobilizer which will óaccommodate children from approximately 12 - 24 months of age.  This will give these young children an opportunity to encourage and maintain proper body alignment. build muscle mass and support a healthier immune system because of the circulation this system enhances in the body.  The use of the Super Mini Mobilizer  allows caregivers to focus on the the problem the child has been diagnosed with, rather than the unknown complications that come with lack of movement and circulation.  Some examples of such complications are future hip and tendon operations, atrophied muscles, contracting of the muscles and additional medical complications with the immune system and general poor health.
$10,000
8.  Attain ISO 13485 level two custom system certification program certificate.  This program certificate verifies that the Company has passed all the necessary requirements to allow it to produce the Mobilizer 1, as well as future products that can be sold internationally as motorized pieces of medical equipment.  This would allow the Mobilizer 1 to be used in hospital settings.  At this time the Mobilizer 1 is CSA approved and Get Mobile Enterprises holds a patent in both Canada and the USA.
$70,000 
9. Fulfill our promise to donate a Mobilizer 1 to one Canadian and one American Veterans Rehabilitation Hospital to help support  those who have so bravely protected their Countries. (Each Mobilizer 1 has the value of $27,000)

<h3>Health Risks &amp;The Impact of Obesity</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>With the obesity epidemic that is currently going on in the
United States, fitness and weight loss has been growing in popularity, if not
becoming an obsession, for Americans. The rate of obesity grew steadily from
1987 to 2007 and all states except Colorado consider at least one fifth of
their population obese. Over 72 million Americans, or one third of the
population of the United States, are considered clinically obese. One
billion people around the world were considered over ideal weight.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>One trend in the industry is the change in demographics of
those who use fitness centers membership used to be concentrated fairly
highly on the 18-34 range, but the popularity has spread out over all age
groups, and increased particularly amongst Americans over 50 and children and
teenagers. Appealing to America's aging demographic will be essential for gym
franchises. One way to appeal to this audience is to add amenities such as
health maintenance and monitoring like checks for blood sugar, blood pressure
and bone density.</p>

</div></div>","Washington Governor Jay Inslee has proposed a 95% tax on ALL vape products, and that is just the beginning...
  Flavor Ban, with the exception of plain Menthol or Tobacco Banning Internet Sales of all Vape-related products Raising the age of Vaping to 21 
Redefining Vape products as Tobacco  If action isn't taken immediately by the Washington community and pro-Vape supporters across the country, other states will implement similar laws. 
New York is already on their way to having Vaping completely banned.
The two bills in question are HB-1645 and SB-5573. Please take the time to read the Bills, so you can be as informed as possible. 

HB-1645 
Proposes to raise the purchasing age from 18 years to 21; Implementing a heavy tax on tobacco and vapor products in order to fund other health departments to develop programs to prevent and reduce tobacco use by youths.
SB-5573 Promoting HB-1645; Prohibiting the sale of flavored e-liquid other than traditional tobacco and menthol flavors; Implementing 95% tax on vapor products, 90% to general state fund and only 10% to public health services; Out-of-state distributors will be unable to do business without a proper license approved by the state of Washington.

Here's what you can do:
Proactive WA vape shops have teamed up with national trade organizations and quite frankly, we need your support to raise funds to hire lobbyists and raise awareness through marketing campaigns.  Please Contribute!
Lobbying is the ONLY way your government will listen! Everyone with an interest in vaping needs to band together - this may be our last chance to fight the ignorance and corruption impeding on your freedom to vape.
Our 2015 goal is to collect $50,000. Everything collected will be used to combat any unfair legislation now and in the future. Money is not the only way you can help.

<p>If you have ever had horses or know anyone who has horses, you know that the horse fascination is a strong one indeed. Genetics and horses share a common theme:  They are addictive.  As ""Addicts"" (us) we require an ""Enabler"" (you) to keep going forward with the obsession in order to further develop the technology and test more horses<i><b> to both prevent disease and enhance performance.</b> </i> The great thing about having this particular addiction (and spreading it) is that it will ultimately benefit humans and the development of human therapeutics.  </p>

<div><h3>What else??</h3></div>
<ul> <li>Who wouldn't want to know more about their horse's health, abilities and an Etalon T shirt to boot?  Not just any T shirt, but one with DNA sequences from your very own horse - now that's custom!!</li> <li>We have several studies waiting in line at our lab on horse samples we've already collected from friends, family, and local rescue groups.  Any funding we receive will go to completing those studies, providing as much diagnostic information as possible to those people/horses and finding the traits or markers we set out to discover (for example: OCD, Laminitus, or susceptibility to EHV, etc.)  </li>
<li>If you choose to fund the Rescue Horse testing (see Perks) we will send you pictures and information on the horses that you've helped fund and rehome. </li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>People helping horses who ultimately help people in so many ways...</p> <ul>
<li>Science is a funny thing.  While people work really hard to create diagnostics and therapeutics for the health of people, it turns out that people are the hardest species in the world to work with, especially when it comes to medical and clinical trials:  You've got heavy expense, regulation, liability, lawyers and doctors, patient confidentiality and reliability, and just one big moral dilemma after another. Not to mention what might happen if doctors ran around tearing chunks of hair out of patients for good DNA samples!  Horses and other mammals like dogs, on the other hand, make excellent subjects.  They couldn't care less about their coat color or what you think of it, they don't have HMO issues, miss appointments, or lie about what they had for lunch.  They are happy in their barn with their friends, eating and working out on the same schedule and performing their best each day.  They do what they can with what they were given and they don't bat an eye at losing a lock of mane or tail.  In short, they make perfect clinical subjects.  What's more?  <b>They are mammals just like us and if we can discover a genetic disorder or predisposition in a horse or dog,<i> it's highly likely that we'll find it in people</i> - we may even know where to look at that point and, possibly, how to treat it.  </b>
</li>
<li>Case and point: In addition to the aforementioned Congenital Night Blindness, the list of <b>genetic disorders suffered by both horses and humans</b> consists of many, including Severe Combined Immunodeficiency, Glycogen Branching Enzyme Deficiency, various metabolic disorders and so on.</li>
<li>Therefore:  Feel good about funding painless research on your horse for the good of horses and know that, ultimately it's also good for people:  you.  This is a better, faster way to discover genetics traits, abilities and disease without victims, pain or HMOs!</li> <li>The <a href=""http://www.etalondx.com/#!team-etalon/cszr"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Etalon team</a> is composed of not only carefully chosen experts in their fields, but of those obsessed with science and animals.  Each of us is driven to research and discover.  We actually do this stuff for fun - really.  Nerdiness aside, however, each of us, from advisors and scientists to business folks and hard-core riders has a demonstrated track record of success and accomplishment.  </li> <li>One last little thing to mention:  <b>We are also working on dogs! </b> We have this theory that if we could help determine talents and temperament, there would be no end to the help we could provide in the training and placement of service dogs, homeless dogs, and dogs in distress.  Think about it...</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The idea that genetic tools can be so very powerful and reveal so much about us is often hard to grasp and even harder to explain.  Getting our message out there that we can, in fact, do this right now is really important.  Understanding what we're on the brink of finding can be simply mindblowing.  Below are some of the conditions and traits we are currently working to find</p> <ul>
<li>Resistance and susceptibility to multiple viruses including EVA, EHV, etc.</li>
<li>Serious and terminal career ending conditions like Laminitis, Navicular, OCD, and Tendonopathy </li>
<li>Fantastic and fun traits like curiosity, vigilance, confidence, and ""bombproofness"" over spookiness</li>
<li>Highly competitive traits such as speed, ability, dressage extension, dressage collection, jumping and more</li> <li>Using our proven platform and, you, our horsey owners, riders, trainers and fans, we can start to parse out who is who in the horsey world and turn those traits hidden deep within pedigrees into real genetic proofs.  </li>
<li>We actually <i>want </i>to hear all about your horse and the silly things he does or won't do, so sign up and tell us all about your horse.  Send us pictures, show us the show scores, <i>we love it</i> and we'll try to provide you with even more in return!</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Even if you're just not in the position to fund us, there are lots of ways you can help</p> <ul>
<li>Pass it on!  Make noise and send this on to your friends and family - one of them is bound to have a horse (or three) and they'll love you for it.</li> <li>Think about the horses and dogs you know who could use a little help, if there's one (or a particular group) tell us their story and we'll see if we can help!</li>

Wouldn't it be great if there was a way to test for these genetic traits all in one affordable test and from one simple lock of hair?  There is now!
Find multiple underlying diseases and health risks, traits and discover abilities (even personality insights) now with one simple test - know your horse, inside and out:

After all, this is likely a major decision and one you'll have to live with for quite some time. 
As an avid horse enthusiast, buyer and owner, I have plenty of horror stories about buying a horse that later turned out to have undisclosed problems (like Navicular & PSSM) or breeding for foals that didn't quite turn out as expected.  I wished many times for some kind of insight, a peek beneath the exterior of each horse so I could understand what was there, what wasn't there, and what I might be faced with later on so I could be prepared or even possibly prevent the oncoming disaster from happening in the first place.  To help you understand exactly how different genes interact, and how predictable they can be,  here's a fun tool we use to illustrate coat color - click here and see for yourself!
As biotech scientists and preclinical specialists we see a way to provide genetic screening for all equines to identify everything from health problems (such as metabolic disorders and viral susceptibility) to color, patterns, and even performance traits, like gaits and speed.  While we're aware that there are scattered genetic tests out there now, they are primarily individual tests leaving the normal horse owner puzzling over which tests to choose and at great expense. For example:
The average cost per trait test is anywhere from $25 to $85 each with some traits going as high as $350 - $1000.  If you wanted to test your horse for everything currently available in the market today, you would have to visit more than 3 labs and shell out over $2000.00.  The situation might look like this
Average cost of testing a horse for the following (assuming the lowest $25 per) is
 Black/Red + Agouti + Cream + HYPP + SCID + PSSM =  $150
Using cutting edge technology, we set out to create an ""All-in-one"" test where one sample is submitted for a single, comprehensive test at one economic price: multiple traits, diseases, multiple colors, patterns and abilities along with a Discovery ability all on one test - a Couture Service designed to detect and reveal as much information as possible for the discerning owner or buyer.  Once we had created, ""the one test to rule them all"" and by popular demand, we chose the most commonly requested traits that would work on a lighter, faster, and even more economical platform and the Minipanel was born. So now, what was
BEFORE:  Black/Red + Agouti + Cream + HYPP + SCID + PSSM =  $150
becomes
NOW:  Black/Red + Agouti + Brindle + Champagne + Cream + Dominant Whites (1-20) + Gait + HERDA + HYPP +  Lavender Foal Syndrome + Lethal White Overo + PSSM + Sabino + SCID + Silver + Speed + Splashed Whites (1-4) + West Nile Virus Susceptibility + more = $150
That means, we can offer 30 + traits and growing for the same price -see below:


We designed our couture platform (or the Complete Panel) as a true ""Discovery"" panel allowing us to not only provide the current known traits, but also to uncover new ones in the process.  The result is a larger comprehensive panel which detects mutations and unknown changes as well as an in depth ongoing research project buzzing away in the background of normal diagnostics but at a much reduced cost in terms of time and money.  We are offering the Complete Panel at $300 (as seen on our website and in the image below):

""The gene that causes Appaloosa spotting(and thus, Congenital Night Blindness) was first uncovered through horse research, which led the human geneticists to realize it was responsible for many ""unknown"" cases of human congenital stationary night blindness, and gave us more of an idea of what this gene's function is!""  Dr. Heather Holl, Equine Geneticist
By supporting our research you'll not only personally benefit from being one of the early adopters and elite Genetically Educated horse folks wandering the streets (and barns), but you'll also have contributed to a major movement in the guardianship and responsible ownership of horses.
For example:  People breed many many horses for the purposes of racing, but, not every foal born to racehorse parents is suited to become a racehorse.  Due to the nature of genetics and statistical chance, that baby might be a crummy racehorse but a fantastic eventing or dressage mount.  In fact, according to Jockey Club statistics, between 2009 and 2012 roughly 86,000 thoroughbred foals were registered, less than half of them ever actually made it to the races.  What happened to the rest? Some are lucky and get adopted for other careers, but in many cases, however, there are not so lucky.  Many face permanent injury, abandonment, and the slaughterhouse.  Wouldn't it be better for both the foal, the breeder, and the future owner to have had that insight as soon as possible to avoid injured or abandoned horses?
The more horses we test and the faster we test them, the faster the discovery platform works (especially with owner and trainer input) and we find new abilities and genetic disorders in weeks and months rather than years.  The equipment and techniques needed to do this are expensive, tricky, and take serious dedication to run.  It takes both funding and expertise along with a whole lot of good will and stubborness to make this happen.  We've got some of those things covered (the expertise, the stubborness and good will for sure) and it got us off to a great start, but we your need help to keep going!  Raising $100k would afford things like:



 leasing equipment, buying reagents, and affording manpower to complete several of our ongoing studies


a stonger outreach program so we can focus more on our rescue horses from collaborators such as the SPCA for Monterey County (where we are currently processing testing on several horses in need of homes)


completing our process of creating a fantastic client-user web interface where your horses' information, profile, health reports, photos, videos, show scores and breedmatching information can be kept and monitored or shared as you wish. (see preview photos in our gallery)  *Building a website is one thing, but building a good one with client security controls is on another level altogether and we want to do this right.


What else??
 Who wouldn't want to know more about their horse's health, abilities and an Etalon T shirt to boot?  Not just any T shirt, but one with DNA sequences from your very own horse - now that's custom!! We have several studies waiting in line at our lab on horse samples we've already collected from friends, family, and local rescue groups.  Any funding we receive will go to completing those studies, providing as much diagnostic information as possible to those people/horses and finding the traits or markers we set out to discover (for example: OCD, Laminitus, or susceptibility to EHV, etc.)  
If you choose to fund the Rescue Horse testing (see Perks) we will send you pictures and information on the horses that you've helped fund and rehome.  
  The Impact People helping horses who ultimately help people in so many ways... 
Science is a funny thing.  While people work really hard to create diagnostics and therapeutics for the health of people, it turns out that people are the hardest species in the world to work with, especially when it comes to medical and clinical trials:  You've got heavy expense, regulation, liability, lawyers and doctors, patient confidentiality and reliability, and just one big moral dilemma after another. Not to mention what might happen if doctors ran around tearing chunks of hair out of patients for good DNA samples!  Horses and other mammals like dogs, on the other hand, make excellent subjects.  They couldn't care less about their coat color or what you think of it, they don't have HMO issues, miss appointments, or lie about what they had for lunch.  They are happy in their barn with their friends, eating and working out on the same schedule and performing their best each day.  They do what they can with what they were given and they don't bat an eye at losing a lock of mane or tail.  In short, they make perfect clinical subjects.  What's more?  They are mammals just like us and if we can discover a genetic disorder or predisposition in a horse or dog, it's highly likely that we'll find it in people - we may even know where to look at that point and, possibly, how to treat it.  

Case and point: In addition to the aforementioned Congenital Night Blindness, the list of genetic disorders suffered by both horses and humans consists of many, including Severe Combined Immunodeficiency, Glycogen Branching Enzyme Deficiency, various metabolic disorders and so on.
Therefore:  Feel good about funding painless research on your horse for the good of horses and know that, ultimately it's also good for people:  you.  This is a better, faster way to discover genetics traits, abilities and disease without victims, pain or HMOs! The Etalon team is composed of not only carefully chosen experts in their fields, but of those obsessed with science and animals.  Each of us is driven to research and discover.  We actually do this stuff for fun - really.  Nerdiness aside, however, each of us, from advisors and scientists to business folks and hard-core riders has a demonstrated track record of success and accomplishment.   One last little thing to mention:  We are also working on dogs!  We have this theory that if we could help determine talents and temperament, there would be no end to the help we could provide in the training and placement of service dogs, homeless dogs, and dogs in distress.  Think about it... 
  Risks & Challenges The idea that genetic tools can be so very powerful and reveal so much about us is often hard to grasp and even harder to explain.  Getting our message out there that we can, in fact, do this right now is really important.  Understanding what we're on the brink of finding can be simply mindblowing.  Below are some of the conditions and traits we are currently working to find 
Resistance and susceptibility to multiple viruses including EVA, EHV, etc.
Serious and terminal career ending conditions like Laminitis, Navicular, OCD, and Tendonopathy 
Fantastic and fun traits like curiosity, vigilance, confidence, and ""bombproofness"" over spookiness
Highly competitive traits such as speed, ability, dressage extension, dressage collection, jumping and more Using our proven platform and, you, our horsey owners, riders, trainers and fans, we can start to parse out who is who in the horsey world and turn those traits hidden deep within pedigrees into real genetic proofs.  
We actually want to hear all about your horse and the silly things he does or won't do, so sign up and tell us all about your horse.  Send us pictures, show us the show scores, we love it and we'll try to provide you with even more in return! 
  Other Ways You Can Help Even if you're just not in the position to fund us, there are lots of ways you can help 
Pass it on!  Make noise and send this on to your friends and family - one of them is bound to have a horse (or three) and they'll love you for it. Think about the horses and dogs you know who could use a little help, if there's one (or a particular group) tell us their story and we'll see if we can help!

Wherever man has left his footprint in the long ascent from barbarism to civilization we will find the hoofprint of the horse beside it.  ~John Moore",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>We're Out of Toothbrushes!</h3>
<p>Did you know that there is only <strong>one dentist</strong> for every <strong>30,000 Samoans</strong>? Samoans on average have the worst dental hygiene in the world. This is mostly because the ability to access high sugar and high calorie foods has increased, but their knowledge of and access to good dental hygiene has not. Some Samoans have <strong>never owned a toothbrush</strong>, and don't know how to use one.</p>
<p>My name is Kyle Roth, and my grandparents have been running a free dental clinic in Samoa for about half a year. They are hard at work, and are swamped with patients! They arranged to bring a few hundred toothbrushes with them, but are giving away many more brushes than they expected. They are in desperate need of supplies.</p>
<p>My family and I will be visiting them this spring to work on several service projects, and we would like to restock their toothbrushes so they can continue to provide Samoans with necessary dental care. We have a goal of bringing <strong>1000 toothbrushes</strong> with us on our visit. With your help, we can reach this goal and <strong>provide one thousand Samoans with the first step in dental care</strong>. 100% of the donations collected will go directly to funding the dental care of these people.</p>
</div>

<h3>What We Need</h3>

<h3>What They're Doing in Samoa</h3>
<p>Here's a story about my grandparents' recent trip to the neighboring island of Savai'i:</p>
<p>""Savai'i is a lovely place where life is simple and peaceful... we headed up to Vaiola Church College to set up our equipment for the next day of dental work. We had a million <span>dollar view of the jungle and beautiful ocean...</span></p>
<p>""The next day we were up early and off to the school to get started. We gave a short program about how to <strong>brush and floss teeth</strong> to the primary school kids and then had them come up by class, to the teacher's room where we were set up... Talk about beautiful kids! They have <span>these big brown eyes and curly dark hair...</span></p>
<p><span>""There were so many that <strong>only had little black stubs for their front teeth</strong>. Some had most teeth decayed away. We spent the day doing check-ups and painting fluoride varnish on their teeth to slow decay.</span></p>
<p><span>""Most were<strong> very grateful and gave us a big smile and a thank you</strong>... We had a wonderful experience helping all those beautiful kids.""</span></p>

questions simple, fast and fun by making the user experience
interesting so that anyone regardless of age would enjoy. For
example, one part of the questionnaire, we allow everyone to have the
ability to create their own fortune cookie or personal quote for

<p>The results will
help a person understand themselves with clarity. It will help
remove their own human perception on who they think they are and/or
how they believe others view them. It will help
them remove themselves from the confusion which wastes their time and
energy. These are common struggles that everyone faces in life from
childhood throughout adulthood. <i>Who Am I Now</i>

everyone around the world will be able to use.</p>

<h3> How Did We Get Here? <br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Together we have met a variety people
that are lost and wandering through life in confusion. Many of these
individuals seem to have jobs or careers they don't like. They're
upset that they went to college to get a degree but have a completely
different career then what they went to school for. Some of them are
upset that they're stuck in a repetitious job and are just realizing
what they actually love.  

</p>
<p>We started to question this occurrence
and believed there had to be a way where everyone no matter who they
were or what age they may be, would be able to discover who they are.
Collaborating, we came up with a solution that would help everyone!</p>

walking, blurred vision and fatigue.</p><p>There are 2 kinds of pain that goes along with MS. You can have <b>Acute pain</b>:<br/></p><p>which is often intense but can be brief in duration. The description of
these acute pain syndromes are sometimes referred to as burning,

Americans and more than two million people worldwide have multiple
sclerosis, many of them, women first stricken in their 20s. The
disease is believed to occur when the body’s immune system attacks
the insulation around nerve fibers, causing symptoms like difficulty
walking, blurred vision and fatigue.There are 2 kinds of pain that goes along with MS. You can have Acute pain:which is often intense but can be brief in duration. The description of
these acute pain syndromes are sometimes referred to as burning,
tingling, shooting, or stabbing.

<h3>Family Is Family!</h3>
<p>Remember that most orphans are orphans for life. They have special needs. A family that will always love them and that will be with them for life is one of them. </p>
<p>""Help SXS Sorority Make Good Magic For Orphans!""</p>
<p>House of XI Maidens! SXS Sisters of XI Sorority Orphans! <br/><a href=""http://www.houseofxi.com/hxi/sorority/sorority_orphans.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>http://www.houseofxi.com/hxi/sorority/sorority_orphans.htm</u></a></p>
<h3>Diamonds In The Rough!</h3>Sisters of XI Sorority Orphan Resource will be seeking out orphan candidates to sponsor through college level studies and career preparation. The areas of SXS Sorority sponsored studies can include endeavors such as Rhythmic Gymnastics, Dance, Tennis, Volley Ball, Graphic Arts, Swimming, Marine Studies, Geological Studies, Agriculture, Archery, Fencing, Cheer Dance. Audio Video Production, and even Fashion Design - We've been an accredited employer at F.I.D.M. Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising for many years. For Example, students enrolled at FIDM can receive school study credits for working on SXS Sisters of XI Sorority ""Vie de Elegance! (TM)"" Fashion Projects.<h3>Love Is Good, Yet It Is Best When It Is Shared!</h3>
<p>For starters we need initial funds to properly setup a lasting trust that will make certain that the resources actually get where they are supposed to go. SXS Sorority has friends and contacts living in regions and cities into which we send assistance, cutting through the red tape of politics and self serving religious organizations, </p>
<p>The cities which we have chosen to send help to, indefinitely, are Sophia Bulgaria, Belfast Northern Ireland, Dublin Ireland, Prague Czech Republic, and Bucharest Romania. </p>
<p>SXS Sorority is committed to freeing forgotten and abandoned children from the constrains of poverty and social status, by giving them the education and international association to know, without a doubt, that they do count and that they are able to live the life they had hoped for. They will receive support through college and beyond. </p>
<p>The Impact - More Means More!</p>
<p>What must be understood is this... It is very difficult for a ten year old student to strive with confidence, when they expect to be expelled and later abandoned to the world, once they've reached a certain age, anyway. </p>
<p>Support from the SXS Orphan Resource gives that same ten year old the hope and surety that their efforts will count and that their accumulated skills, education and experiences are meaningful. A family for life, no matter what, supercharges and inspires that Kid to believe in them self, learn more, and be better prepared for a productive and more expressive life. </p>
<h3></h3>
</div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>Our campaign financial goal is very small to help insure that at least the first step (organizing a 501c3 Trust) gets accomplished. Then we will need your help to raise much more and start sponsoring some Kid's educations and career preparatory activities for them! Let's Do This! </p><p>Help Us Be Able To Tell Another Abandoned Child That People Care About Them So Much That Their Education Is Funded!</p><p>And That They Have A New Family!</p><p>For Life!</p><p>SXS Sisters of XI Sorority - We Really Can Change The World - One Life At A Time!</p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Don't just wait for us or someone else to help these Kids. Get on the web, get on the phone, and find orphans or orphan care givers and ask them what they need. You can probably help more than you think that you can.</p><p>Here are just a few things the SXS Sisters of XI Sorority found that orphans really need Right Now! </p><p>Clothing, grooming supplies, school supplies, medical care, school uniforms, rail passes to get to school, books, art supplies, technical supplies, computers, eye glasses, documentations - they are expensive and a constant set back for orphans at every stage of life, hearing aids, wash towels, food, and nutritional supplements - these Kids deserve vitamins too. </p><p>Just contact an orphanage and see for yourself how much is needed and what you can do about that, You Can Do It!</p><p><br/></p></div>","Family Is Family!

The areas of SXS Sorority sponsored studies can include endeavors such as Rhythmic Gymnastics, Dance, Tennis, Volley Ball, Graphic Arts, Swimming, Marine Studies, Geological Studies, Agriculture, Archery, Fencing, Cheer Dance. Audio Video Production, and even Fashion Design - We've been an accredited employer at F.I.D.M. Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising for many years. For Example, students enrolled at FIDM can receive school study credits for working on SXS Sisters of XI Sorority ""Vie de Elegance! (TM)"" Fashion Projects.Love Is Good, Yet It Is Best When It Is Shared!
For starters we need initial funds to properly setup a lasting trust that will make certain that the resources actually get where they are supposed to go. SXS Sorority has friends and contacts living in regions and cities into which we send assistance, cutting through the red tape of politics and self serving religious organizations, 
The cities which we have chosen to send help to, indefinitely, are Sophia Bulgaria, Belfast Northern Ireland, Dublin Ireland, Prague Czech Republic, and Bucharest Romania. 
SXS Sorority is committed to freeing forgotten and abandoned children from the constrains of poverty and social status, by giving them the education and international association to know, without a doubt, that they do count and that they are able to live the life they had hoped for. They will receive support through college and beyond. 
The Impact - More Means More!
What must be understood is this... It is very difficult for a ten year old student to strive with confidence, when they expect to be expelled and later abandoned to the world, once they've reached a certain age, anyway. 
Support from the SXS Orphan Resource gives that same ten year old the hope and surety that their efforts will count and that their accumulated skills, education and experiences are meaningful. A family for life, no matter what, supercharges and inspires that Kid to believe in them self, learn more, and be better prepared for a productive and more expressive life. 

Risks & ChallengesOur campaign financial goal is very small to help insure that at least the first step (organizing a 501c3 Trust) gets accomplished. Then we will need your help to raise much more and start sponsoring some Kid's educations and career preparatory activities for them! Let's Do This! Help Us Be Able To Tell Another Abandoned Child That People Care About Them So Much That Their Education Is Funded!And That They Have A New Family!For Life!SXS Sisters of XI Sorority - We Really Can Change The World - One Life At A Time!Other Ways You Can HelpDon't just wait for us or someone else to help these Kids. Get on the web, get on the phone, and find orphans or orphan care givers and ask them what they need. You can probably help more than you think that you can.Here are just a few things the SXS Sisters of XI Sorority found that orphans really need Right Now! Clothing, grooming supplies, school supplies, medical care, school uniforms, rail passes to get to school, books, art supplies, technical supplies, computers, eye glasses, documentations - they are expensive and a constant set back for orphans at every stage of life, hearing aids, wash towels, food, and nutritional supplements - these Kids deserve vitamins too. Just contact an orphanage and see for yourself how much is needed and what you can do about that, You Can Do It!",0.0,0,"7 Campaigns

The Backmate weighs under 4lbs and has removable end caps to easily fit a standard size carry-on suitcase, making it perfect for taking it to the office, the hotel, and even the gym. Because so many of our friends and beta-testers are professional athletes, we made sure The Backmate was travel-ready.  
 
 
 Hi, I’m Eric Bostrom. That's me in the picture above from Sports Illustrated, sliding on the ground at 100 MPH, about to wear a 400 lbs motorcycle on my head.I spent 25 years racing motorcycles and winning multiple championships for Kawasaki, Harley-Davidson, Ducati and Honda. Ever since I was a little kid, being on bike has been my passion. It’s always been the one thing that has kept me focused and happy to be alive. And then it happened…I suffered a traumatic spine injury and was left with relentless neck and back pain. All of a sudden, my entire life was put on hold. When you wake up in pain each day—life feels hopeless. I visited medical experts around the country, tried addictive pain pills, and even contemplated risky surgeries—nothing worked and my pain and depression grew.Unwilling to give up, I deciding to take things into my own hands. Combining years of research, science, and using my own broken body as a guinea pig, I developed The Backmate SELF-MASSAGE DEVICE to come back stronger than ever. If I can find pain relief, so can you.  
 
 
 While I searched for a solution for relief, I saw first hand the reason so many people live with pain.For one, physical therapy is incredibly expensive. And my insurance (like many others) would not cover me. Secondly, there was nothing that gave me long-term pain relief. Even when I did find relief with massage therapists, my symptoms would quickly return because I couldn’t be there everyday.There was also no other massage devices that could effectively reach all areas of the body. I needed to work on all muscles groups to properly relieve my back and neck pain. To make matters worse, the pain medications doctors prescribed were making me sick and miserable. My brain was foggy, my bank account was drained, and my body was still broken.  
 We realized the world deserves an all-in-one self-massage system that is EASY and EFFECTIVE for fighting pain and stress and helping more people feel amazing in their bodies. 
 
 We didn’t set out to make a tool that helped “take the edge off” or make pain “more manageable.” The Backmate was always and will forever be a tool that leads to a healthier life where humans can thrive and continue to push themselves in all areas of life. It isn’t a rehab device, it’s an accelerator to reach the next level in anything you want to do, both in body and mind. But getting here wasn’t easy… It took tons of trial and error. Tons of feedback from friends, family, and other professional athletes. Some things worked, some didn’t. But we slowly inched closer and closer to what would ultimately become the ultimate self-massage device.We created this Indiegogo campaign to get the Backmate into your doorway as soon as possible! Our patent pending design is 90% done and now we NEED your help! Join the Backmate community and help us make The Backmate even better! 
 We added the dual-roller, fully rotating massage head to fit into any and all muscle groups. It allows you to hit the perfect angle no matter what type of tension and pain you’re feeling. 
 
 Unlike other self-massagers, The Backmate lets you easily use your own body weight to apply the perfect amount of pressure.No more tensing your upper body to massage your back and neck... No need to tire out your hands or arms working other areas...Just pure and simple pain relief.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 

The rollers come off with a simple press of a button and can be swapped out with a variety of options. The Backmate comes with a set of the standard ball rollers AND a set of blade-shaped rollers. Upgrade to the premium perk to get an additional set of rollers that can be heated or cooled by placing in your microwave or freezer and take your massage therapy to the next level!

 Once I had The Backmate, it only took a few weeks before I was on a bike.

<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">With the funds in place, we will be able to purchase a generator in Cameroon and truck it to Djohong.  The cost for a generator and shipping would be $10,000.00.  We'd like to be able to cover $9,000.00 of this cost and look for local contributions to cover additional costs like the cost of installing it, building a shed to house it, maintenance and fuel.  </span></p>

<p>Strips is the world’s thinnest magnetic sensor. So thin that it can be
placed invisibly on windows and doors! </p>
<p>Strips is your new window and door guard. It can notify you if you’ve left anything open or if something goes wrong and can
communicate with other smarthome devices.</p>
<p>From the very first day we have pushed the limits of what a
magnetic sensor could be. Today we are proud to present Strips, a sensor that’s
less than 3 mm thick, comes with a battery life of up to ten years, and is easy to
use. We believe, and several people in the industry agree, that Strips will be
the next generation of magnetic sensor.</p>
<p>That’s why we are at Indiegogo. We need your support to make
invisible sensors the new standard for windows and doors.</p>
<p>Support our campaign by liking, sharing and becoming one of
the first Strips owners in the world.</p>

<h2>What Strips can do for you:</h2>
<p>Strips can offer you complete perimeter protection and can keep you and your home protected, whether you are there or not. Strips makes your everyday life easier, you are able to check that everything is OK, it alerts you if something unexpected happens or, if you’ve simply forgotten to close a window or door. By placing it between the window/door and its frame, it becomes your invisible guard.</p>

<h2>Why we developed Strips: </h2>
</div><div>
<div>Smart homes make sense, but we see a lot of smart home products that are not good enough. They are: </div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Too difficult to mount</li>
<li>Too visible</li>
<li>Too complicated to connect</li>
</ul>
<div>And, you (or your installer) needs to replace the battery far too often (every second year in many cases).</div>

<p>In order to make an invisible window and door sensor, we have really pushed the limits to make Strips as thin as possible while still meeting the 10 year battery life target. Here are some of the actions we took:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Dual processors. A dedicated ultra-low power application processor manages all built-in sensors and wakes the Z-wave processor only to send data to the gateway.</li>
<li>A completely new battery, optimised for Strips, based on smart card battery technology.</li>
<li>An ultra-thin plastic cover design using our experience from mobile phone development.</li>
<li>A small surface-mounted anisotropic magnetoresistive sensor , instead of traditional bulkier reed switches.</li>
<li>An ultra-thin PCB board which also acts as the lid of the sensor.<br/>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Designing the concept</h4>
<p></p>
<p>Our team accepted the challenge to create a great looking and incredibly thin magnetic sensor with world-class battery performance.</p>
<p>At first we used replaceable batteries and existing built-in batteries. We made a lot of design sketches. Finally we came up with a good conceptual design. Next we made a few really good looking mock-ups, tried it on friends and business partners and we got a fantastic response. We also found our battery partner and designed the advanced architecture needed to get it to an expected life of 10 years. </p>
<p>Voila! Strips was born! </p>

<h2>The Story of Sensative</h2>
</div><div>
<p>Fredrik Westman, a young student and Anders Hedberg, an experienced tech wizard, met during an innovation competition and submitted an idea for an ultra-thin magnetic, window and door sensor.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">They didn’t win.</span><br/></p>
<p>But Fredrik and Anders truly believed in their idea and became committed to proving their concept. They soon validated that they would be able to make a sensor so thin that it could fit invisibly on most doors and windows. And, a short time later, Sensative AB was born.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">This idea later turned out to become the revolutionary, ultra-thin sensor, Strips.</span><br/></p>
<p>During the early development of Strips, Mats Pettersson, a Sony Mobile veteran with hands-on experience from concept designs, technology &amp; product development as well as product planning and executive management joined the team as CEO and project manager. </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">With Mats on-board we attracted a few more members with mobile phone experience and soon had a complete and skilled team ready to take Strips all the way to market.</span></p>

<h2>FAQ:</h2>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What is Strips?</b></p>
<p>Strips is an ultra-thin, wireless, magnetic sensor that can be mounted invisibly on most windows and doors to detect if it is open or closed. It uses the Z-Wave smart home communications protocol to communicate with your smartphone through a Z-Wave gateway and your internet connection. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Where do you mount Strips?</b><br/></p>
<p>Strips is designed to be placed on a window or door, between the sash/door and the frame. However, Strips and its magnet will not work satisfactory if placed on a solid metal surface or in a metal cavity.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>You should also check how the window´s opening mechanism is designed. There may be moving parts that Strips could interfere with.</p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Can I mount Strips on every window/door?</b><br/></p>
<p>Strips works with almost any window and door. Whether you can mount it invisibly or not will depend on the gap between the window and its frame. You’ll need at least a 3 mm gap. You may do the “coin test” to check if your gap is wide enough.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The “coint test” is a simple test to verify that there is space for Strips in your windows and doors. Here are some coins you can use to verify, in different currencies:</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>- USD: 1 x 50C + 1 x 25C coin</p>
<p>- EURO: 1 x cent + 1 x nickel</p>
<p>- CAN: 2 x 5 cent</p>
<p>- GBP: 2 x 20 p</p>
<p>- NK: 2 x 1 kr </p>
<p>- DK: 2 x 1 kr</p>
<p>- SEK: 2 x 1 kr</p>
<p>
And we do not recommend that you place Strips inside a window made of solid aluminum or other metal, because it will significantly decrease its radio performance.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">What if Strips does not fit between the window/door and its frame?</b><br/></p>
<p>There are many different doors and windows. Strips fits in most modern windows and doors. But there will certainly be times when Strips will not fit into this space. </p>
<p>First check all four sides of the frame and all four sides of the window.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If it still doesn’t work, Strips can be placed like a regular sensor on the outside of the frame and the magnet on the window. Thanks to Strips discreet design and white color it will still look good, however it will no longer be invisible.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">How is Strips Powered?</b><br/></p>
<p>Strips uses an environmental-friendly LiMnO2 battery cell designed as a integrated unit in Strips. </p>
<p>

</div></div>","In Demand to end on October 9th, 2015.

Thank you to all of our Sensative Hero's!
Thanks to you all, we've reached 265% (and counting) of our goal! We'll be around for a little while longer (till October 9th, 2015) as an In Demand campaign to give those heros who may have been a little late the chance to support us by contributing or sharing our message.
We are so honored to have received this tremendous outpouring of support, compliments and well wishes. We know that Stips is going to change the way people see, or rather don't see, magnetic sensors and this is just the start for Sensative.
We're certain you're going to see many more great things from us. Thanks for supporting us from the start!
 

Strips by Sensative is the world's thinnest wireless, magnetic, window and door sensor! It is so thin it can be mounted invisibly on most windows and doors.









Meet Strips:

Strips is the world’s thinnest magnetic sensor. So thin that it can be
placed invisibly on windows and doors! 
Strips is your new window and door guard. It can notify you if you’ve left anything open or if something goes wrong and can
communicate with other smarthome devices.
From the very first day we have pushed the limits of what a
magnetic sensor could be. Today we are proud to present Strips, a sensor that’s
less than 3 mm thick, comes with a battery life of up to ten years, and is easy to
use. We believe, and several people in the industry agree, that Strips will be
the next generation of magnetic sensor.
That’s why we are at Indiegogo. We need your support to make
invisible sensors the new standard for windows and doors.
Support our campaign by liking, sharing and becoming one of
the first Strips owners in the world.


Measuring less than 3 mm (< 0,12 inches), Strips is the thinnest wireless magnetic sensor in the world.


What Strips can do for you:
Strips can offer you complete perimeter protection and can keep you and your home protected, whether you are there or not. Strips makes your everyday life easier, you are able to check that everything is OK, it alerts you if something unexpected happens or, if you’ve simply forgotten to close a window or door. By placing it between the window/door and its frame, it becomes your invisible guard.






Why we developed Strips: 

Smart homes make sense, but we see a lot of smart home products that are not good enough. They are: 


Too difficult to mount
Too visible
Too complicated to connect

And, you (or your installer) needs to replace the battery far too often (every second year in many cases).


(Example of today's magnetic sensor. Not good enough!)

Strips by Sensative, now that makes sense! 



It is as easy to mount as a sticker
Neither you or a burglar will see Strips
When a window or door is closed, Strips is protected from tampering
Stips will be Z-Wave plus certified for enhanced compatibility and ease of use
And, you can forget about needing to change a battery for up to 10 years! 







Mounting Strips is easy! Use the adhesive backing to easily mount
Strips and the magnet in place. Almost as easy as a sticker! 

Strips Features:

Strips is a unique sensor, here are some of the features it provides:





Invisible and simple mounting: The days of drilling and wires are gone! At just under 3 mm, the sensor fits invisibly between the door/window and its frame. All you have to do is connect Strips to a Z-Wave gateway, then use the adhesive backing to stick the magnet to the door or window and the sensor to the frame.
Indoor & outdoor usage: Strips is designed for both indoor and outdoor environments. That means you can use it as an outdoor thermometer or to monitor your storage or garage door. 
Don’t forget: With a battery that has a lifespan of up to ten years it's easy to forget about the sensor once it's mounted. But, the sensor keeps track of the remaining power in the battery and will let you know when it’s running low. 
Temperature: No bulky sensors, only a slim, sleek design which detects the temperature in a room in order for you to better manage your energy usage and lower your energy bills. (Stretch Goal 100 000 USD)

Connectivity: Strips uses Z-Wave technology. Z-Wave enables communication between smarthome devices, Strips can talk to you through your smart phone. In order to do this, you will need a Z-Wave gateway to include Strips into your smarthome network. 
What is a gateway?

Z-Wave is a communication technology which makes it possible to connect Strips and other Z-wave devices in your home.
You connect a Z-Wave gateway to your internet router. The gateway will connect an app on your smartphone to Strips and your other Z-Wave devices so you can be in control of your smart home.
During the campaign, we can offer a great opportunity to buy a complete kit from our friends at WeBeHome. We have tested and optimised the performance for your best experience. Here is a link for more information https://www.webehome.com/Doc/WeBeHome_HG2_product_sheet.pdf
Now you can get started on a smaller scale with our Starter Hero Kit. The same WeBeHome gateway, 1 year service and only 3 Strips to get your smarthome system up on running!





SUPPORT US, BECOME A SUPER HERO
PERKS: 




The Strips Design
In order to make an invisible window and door sensor, we have really pushed the limits to make Strips as thin as possible while still meeting the 10 year battery life target. Here are some of the actions we took:


Dual processors. A dedicated ultra-low power application processor manages all built-in sensors and wakes the Z-wave processor only to send data to the gateway.
A completely new battery, optimised for Strips, based on smart card battery technology.
An ultra-thin plastic cover design using our experience from mobile phone development.
A small surface-mounted anisotropic magnetoresistive sensor , instead of traditional bulkier reed switches.
An ultra-thin PCB board which also acts as the lid of the sensor.






Designing the concept

Our team accepted the challenge to create a great looking and incredibly thin magnetic sensor with world-class battery performance.
At first we used replaceable batteries and existing built-in batteries. We made a lot of design sketches. Finally we came up with a good conceptual design. Next we made a few really good looking mock-ups, tried it on friends and business partners and we got a fantastic response. We also found our battery partner and designed the advanced architecture needed to get it to an expected life of 10 years. 
Voila! Strips was born! 








The different layers of Strips:


How it works:
Check out the video to see how the latest prototype works, how you connect Strips to a Z-Wave gateway from WeBeHome.


The Story of Sensative

Fredrik Westman, a young student and Anders Hedberg, an experienced tech wizard, met during an innovation competition and submitted an idea for an ultra-thin magnetic, window and door sensor.
They didn’t win.
But Fredrik and Anders truly believed in their idea and became committed to proving their concept. They soon validated that they would be able to make a sensor so thin that it could fit invisibly on most doors and windows. And, a short time later, Sensative AB was born.
This idea later turned out to become the revolutionary, ultra-thin sensor, Strips.
During the early development of Strips, Mats Pettersson, a Sony Mobile veteran with hands-on experience from concept designs, technology & product development as well as product planning and executive management joined the team as CEO and project manager. 
With Mats on-board we attracted a few more members with mobile phone experience and soon had a complete and skilled team ready to take Strips all the way to market.

Our journey from idea to market





Support us and become a hero
Developing a cutting edge product like Strips is not easy. Funding from our Indiegogo campaign will go in part to the following important activities. 
Certification: The battery and the complete Strips sensor needs to be certified for sales in both Europe and North-America at certified test houses. We will also conduct Z-Wave compliance tests to make sure that Strips works flawlessly with other Z-wave devices and systems.
Production: Setting up the factory for production and ordering the parts that go together to create Strips.
Delivery: Shipping Strips to our heroes! We are really looking forward to this day! 


Why your support is really important for us
We are proud to present Strips and the team that made it possible.  We truly believe our unique and revolutionary sensor will change the industry. We simply see no reason why there should be visible, complicated and even ugly sensors when they could be invisible, easy to use and beautifully designed! Do you? 
Now you can be a hero! Become one of the first in the world to protect your home with Strips. Just as important, you can also support us by spreading the word through social channels, reaching out to your networks through email, sharing with bloggers and others in the media.

Risks & Challenges:
Developing a product like Strips is demanding.  The only way to succeed is to really push the limits further than you (and everyone else) thinks is possible. When we started, we were constantly told this was an impossible task and we still often get that response when we show Strips to someone new. But, we are now proud to say that we will succeed, all critical design parts are validated and we are looking forward taking Strips to market.Now our main attention is on remaining software functionality, certifications, quality and production ramp up. We are working very hard to secure any issues as we know that even a tiny flaw could have a large impact on the product or delivery to our customers.Strips will make it to market. Of this we have no doubt. However, If any challenges cause some perks to be shipped later than expected, our supporters can count on being notified of any delays as soon as we become aware of any issues.
FAQ:



What is Strips?
Strips is an ultra-thin, wireless, magnetic sensor that can be mounted invisibly on most windows and doors to detect if it is open or closed. It uses the Z-Wave smart home communications protocol to communicate with your smartphone through a Z-Wave gateway and your internet connection. 


Where do you mount Strips?
Strips is designed to be placed on a window or door, between the sash/door and the frame. However, Strips and its magnet will not work satisfactory if placed on a solid metal surface or in a metal cavity.


You should also check how the window´s opening mechanism is designed. There may be moving parts that Strips could interfere with.
Can I mount Strips on every window/door?
Strips works with almost any window and door. Whether you can mount it invisibly or not will depend on the gap between the window and its frame. You’ll need at least a 3 mm gap. You may do the “coin test” to check if your gap is wide enough.


The “coint test” is a simple test to verify that there is space for Strips in your windows and doors. Here are some coins you can use to verify, in different currencies:


- USD: 1 x 50C + 1 x 25C coin
- EURO: 1 x cent + 1 x nickel
- CAN: 2 x 5 cent
- GBP: 2 x 20 p
- NK: 2 x 1 kr 
- DK: 2 x 1 kr
- SEK: 2 x 1 kr

And we do not recommend that you place Strips inside a window made of solid aluminum or other metal, because it will significantly decrease its radio performance.


What if Strips does not fit between the window/door and its frame?
There are many different doors and windows. Strips fits in most modern windows and doors. But there will certainly be times when Strips will not fit into this space. 
First check all four sides of the frame and all four sides of the window.


If it still doesn’t work, Strips can be placed like a regular sensor on the outside of the frame and the magnet on the window. Thanks to Strips discreet design and white color it will still look good, however it will no longer be invisible.


How is Strips Powered?
Strips uses an environmental-friendly LiMnO2 battery cell designed as a integrated unit in Strips. 


What is the expected battery life?
The estimated battery life is up to 10 years under normal usage. Of course, extreme usage and conditions may affect this.


What mobile platforms will Strips work with?
Strips will be Z-wave plus compliance tested to work any Z-Wave system. Most Z-wave systems support at least both IOS and Android.


Does Strips talk directly to my phone?
Strips communicates with a Z-Wave Gateway connected to your internet connection. The gateway will forward Strips information to a cloud service that sends the notification to your phone.
Sensative says that Strips is weatherproof. What does this mean?
Strips is designed to withstand normal outdoor climates. The mounted PCB is coated in a moisture protective film before it is placed and sealed in the plastic casing. All components are specified to work between -30 degrees Celsius (-22 F) up to + 80 degrees Celsius (176 F).


What colors does Strips come in?
Initially Strips will come in a very gentle off white to fit in your white windows. If the interest is large for Strips in any other color, we would be happy to look into that


What gateways will Strips work with?
Strips will be Z-Wave plus certified and compliance tested to work with any Z-wave gateway. 


Strips doesn’t work with my gateway. What should I do?
If you have followed the inclusion directions and still can’t include Strips in to your gateway, please send an email to support@sensative.com and describe the problem.

The Impact
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step....Lao-tzu
If we can help just one person fight obesity, it is worth the effort.  We cannot fall victim to circumstance, ignorance or indifference.  Make the effort to help, be that change.

<h3>Help Us Help My Parents</h3>
<p>My Dad unexpectedly went in to the hospital with a heart problem. We were all beside ourselves. He is at home recovering from procedures that worked to regulate his heart beat. It was at this point that we realized that they are too far away from us kids, and we desperately need to get them moved closer. </p>
<p>They are on a fixed income.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>We Need Help With the Cost of the Moving my Parents:</h3>
<p>$1,500 for fuel expesnes. We will need to make several trips with trucks and trailers, unless we could afford a moving company. The trip is 3 hours one way.</p>
<p>$150 additional security depost so they can keep their beloved dog. </p>
<p>$380 security deposit</p>
<p>Any and all contributions will be used to make this move happen. Excess funds will be donated to a good cause.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Help us Help them</h3>
<p>I have never asked for anything, until now. </p>
<p>If one of my parents were to pass away tomorrow, I would be devastated. We would then be moving one of them and planning a funeral. It is extremely important to get them moved so I can help them and make sure they have what they need. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Please spread the word. </h3>
<p>I understand that there are other people in serious need. We are not asking for much - just a little. Please help us so we can help them. </p>

<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>
<p>The United States produces approximately 6 million tons of medical waste each year.  Much of this is equipment and supplies that are still in usable condition.</p>
<p>At the same time, Cameroon suffers some of the worst supported health care on earth.  Cameroon was ranked number 164 out of 190 countries considered by the World Health Organization.  The Cameroonian government spends only 0.9% of its GDP on health, contrary to the World Health Organization’s recommended minimum of 4%.  With 48% of the population living below the poverty line, this leaves a burden for health payments the Cameroonian people cannot afford to bear: 80% of the population cannot afford even basic health care. </p>
<p><strong>Our Mission</strong></p>
<p>SHARE is dedicated to promoting sustainable healthcare through the recycling of used medical equipment from the US for use in Cameroon.  SHARE aims to bridge the disconnect between the excess of recycled equipment in the United States and the need for equipment in Cameroonian hospitals.</p>
<p>The basis of SHARE can be summarized by 4 Cs: Contact, Collect, Consign, and Coach. Contact hospitals in the developing nations that are in dire need of supplies and equipment, collect the medical supplies, consign the needed supplies to developing nations (starting in Cameroon), and coach the physicians on proper care and use of equipment. Our focus is not only to provide support in the initial stages with medical supplies and extensive internal training, but also to foster the hospitals abroad to become self-sufficient without us in the long-run.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Your contribution will make a real and lasting impact.  Our pilot partner hospital is one of only two mental health hospitals serving the entire Cameroonian population of 20 million people. The hospital also has pulmonary and HIV/AIDS divisions, and the staff is dedicated and passionate about their patients.  However, there is a severe lack of equipment, particularly beds.  Your contribution will help us ship beds and other equipment to this hospital, transforming the lives of the patients there.</p>
<p><strong>Our Vision</strong></p>
<p>SHARE is unique in that we are training and providing long-term support to develop hospital autonomy. In addition, our final goal is to differentiate SHARE from other organizations by creating enduring connections between hospitals in the United States and Cameroon.  To do so, we plan to implement a “Sister Hospital” program, as well as to create an online database to improve the connection between suppliers of equipment in the United States and seekers of equipment abroad.</p>
<p>Within one year's time following the first shipment, SHARE will collaborate with the partner hospital to create a statistical analysis of the impact of the equipment, which will involve both qualitative and quantitative studies.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our vision is for a world in which Cameroonian hospitals can function to their full potential, and provide their patients with the care they deserve. </p>
<p>Please join us in our efforts! Every little bit counts.</p>

<li><p>Not at all! Many products you already own will fit in the bottom layer of the Renzoe Box.</p></li>
<li><p>Of all those palettes and products you own, you probably have your <strong>go-to favorites</strong> that you <strong>use often</strong> and <strong>re-buy</strong> every few months. Order just your favorites in Renzoe Pods to start.  </p></li>
<li><p>Anything too large that doesn't fit? Keep it! Use it at home! All those really fun colors are great to have in your collection, but you probably rarely use and doesn't make sense to take a whole palette with you. Whereas your Renzoe Box will be your perfect <strong>daily essentials</strong> on-the-go case.</p></li>

<li>Yes, you can certainly wait until Renzoe Box is available through our website, but by backing today you'll own a Renzoe Box at an exclusive price that won't be offered again commercially.  Why not save $50 now?</li>
<li>Also please keep in mind we sold out of our first production round. We highly recommend reserving a Renzoe Box from our second production round by ordering today.</li>

<li><p>Any brand! No matter the product, you will be able to purchase it in a Renzoe Pod from our online store.</p></li>
<li><p>The Starter Kit comes with FREE makeup by Kismet Cosmetics. Use these or save them for later. After you receive your Starter Kit, you can fill the rest of your Renzoe Box with any brand and product you choose by placing an order for Renzoe Pods.</p></li>

<li><p>Rather than a preset palette with preset colors, with the Renzoe Box you can mix &amp; match brands, products and shades into a single palette. Say, for example, you use foundation by Lancôme, blush by NARS, and eyeshadow by MAC. Now you can have them all in one palette! With the prefab kits you cannot customize with different brands.</p></li>
<li><p>Aren't you tired of buying a big palette with shades you know you'll never use? Now you can have one easy-to-carry kit with JUST the colors you ACTUALLY use.</p></li>

About the Brush Set (included)About Kismet Cosmetics (included FREE)Frequently Asked Questions What about the makeup I already own? Do I have to start all over?//
Not at all! Many products you already own will fit in the bottom layer of the Renzoe Box.
Of all those palettes and products you own, you probably have your go-to favorites that you use often and re-buy every few months. Order just your favorites in Renzoe Pods to start.  
Anything too large that doesn't fit? Keep it! Use it at home! All those really fun colors are great to have in your collection, but you probably rarely use and doesn't make sense to take a whole palette with you. Whereas your Renzoe Box will be your perfect daily essentials on-the-go case.
 Why buy now?  I could just wait until later...//
Yes, you can certainly wait until Renzoe Box is available through our website, but by backing today you'll own a Renzoe Box at an exclusive price that won't be offered again commercially.  Why not save $50 now?
Also please keep in mind we sold out of our first production round. We highly recommend reserving a Renzoe Box from our second production round by ordering today.
 What brands can I get in my Renzoe Box? //
Any brand! No matter the product, you will be able to purchase it in a Renzoe Pod from our online store.
The Starter Kit comes with FREE makeup by Kismet Cosmetics. Use these or save them for later. After you receive your Starter Kit, you can fill the rest of your Renzoe Box with any brand and product you choose by placing an order for Renzoe Pods.
 What's the difference between this and prefab palettes I can find at Ulta or Sephora? //
Rather than a preset palette with preset colors, with the Renzoe Box you can mix & match brands, products and shades into a single palette. Say, for example, you use foundation by Lancôme, blush by NARS, and eyeshadow by MAC. Now you can have them all in one palette! With the prefab kits you cannot customize with different brands.
Aren't you tired of buying a big palette with shades you know you'll never use? Now you can have one easy-to-carry kit with JUST the colors you ACTUALLY use.
 Can I really get ANY brand? How does this work? //Yes, you can really get any brand. We are working with brands to provide their best selling products & shades in Renzoe Pods. These we will keep in inventory available for purchase at our online store. If we don't have stock available of the particular product you want, we will source it and make a custom Renzoe Pod for you in our cosmetic laboratory based in Texas. Additional processing time and fee may apply for non-stock items, but no matter the product, you will be able to get it in a Renzoe Pod. How far along are you in production? //We are currently producing our first round of Starter Kits. Our first production round is just starting to roll out and we delivered the first Renzoe Box to a happy customer on 08/03/18! We anticipate delivery of all the first round of Starter Kits by mid September 2018, after which we will begin production on the second round. By purchasing today you are reserving a unit from our second round of production. I still don’t understand. Can you explain step-by-step? //
