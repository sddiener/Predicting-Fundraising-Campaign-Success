<h3><strong>What do we want to do:</strong></h3>
<p>We want to make the first in the history of our Adygs (Circassian) people Historical-Geographical Map. Names of about 1,000 inhabited localities and about 1,500 geographical locations (mountains, rivers, lakes, caves, waterfalls) will be put on this map – in the original Adygs (Circassian) language with explanatory material about the origin of these names, also in Russian, English, Arabic, Hindi….</p>
<p><u>The history should be available to everyone.</u></p>
<p><u><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://adygahasa.com/IndieGoGo/(1).gif"" src=""""/></u></p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Why do we want to do it:</strong></h3>
<p>Nowadays Adygs people (Circassians) live for generations in more than 15 countries, our total number is about seven and a half million people, which is less than 0.1% of world’s population.</p>
<p>Ban on studying our mother tongue in schools, ban on the demonstration of our culture, constant changes in the name of settlements and geographic locations, as well as natural processes in the form of degradation and assimilation led us to the fact that - <u>we are endangered people.</u></p>
<p>The general map of our homeland will allow: at least to slow down these harmful processes, and at most to reverse them, <u>strengthen the connection of all Adygs people (Circassians) on the planet.</u></p>

I have been working hard in the Philadelphia comedy scene over the last  8yrs to establish myself as a fixture. If you've been to any Philadelphia Open Mic you probably have seen me.

<h3>Short Summary - Descripción</h3>
<p>ARS Colombiana is a musical practice and teaching center for adults and seniors. With a strong social sense, we believe in music as an unparalleled means to improve the quality of life of those who have given us so much. That is why at ARS Colombiana we have created, more than a music school, a group of friends in which the most important thing is the welfare of each of our students.</p>

Con un fuerte sentido social, creemos en la música como un inigualable medio para mejorar la calidad de vida de aquellos que nos han dado tanto.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get - Lo Que Necesitamos</h3>
<p>However, we still have much to fulfill our dream: a site perfectly suited to the limitations and needs of our members, in which we can provide, in addition to the musical activity, spaces for recreation, well-being, health and cultural enrichment. We are on the good way; our musical groups are in constant activity and, eventually, we have presentations and concerts that enhance the activity that our adults perform with so much love. We have great challenges: we need to adapt the spaces of our headquarters with easy access, adequate furniture, coffe space and quality instruments. It is necessary to adapt ourselves to the requirements of the law for the protection and prevention of disasters, to install security measures to protect the assets that we have achieved and, why not?

</div></div>","Short Summary - Descripción
ARS Colombiana is a musical practice and teaching center for adults and seniors. With a strong social sense, we believe in music as an unparalleled means to improve the quality of life of those who have given us so much. That is why at ARS Colombiana we have created, more than a music school, a group of friends in which the most important thing is the welfare of each of our students.
 
ARS Colombiana es un centro de Práctica y Enseñanza musical para adultos y adultos mayores. Con un fuerte sentido social, creemos en la música como un inigualable medio para mejorar la calidad de vida de aquellos que nos han dado tanto. Por eso en ARS Colombiana hemos creado, más que una escuela de música, un grupo de amigos en el que lo más importante es el bienestar de cada uno de nuestros estudiantes.
 

What We Need & What You Get - Lo Que Necesitamos
However, we still have much to fulfill our dream: a site perfectly suited to the limitations and needs of our members, in which we can provide, in addition to the musical activity, spaces for recreation, well-being, health and cultural enrichment. We are on the good way; our musical groups are in constant activity and, eventually, we have presentations and concerts that enhance the activity that our adults perform with so much love. We have great challenges: we need to adapt the spaces of our headquarters with easy access, adequate furniture, coffe space and quality instruments. It is necessary to adapt ourselves to the requirements of the law for the protection and prevention of disasters, to install security measures to protect the assets that we have achieved and, why not? Dreaming of our own headquarters one day. Surely with the help of all we will achieve it.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! Kuzuzampu-la! We are Michael Hughes and Emily Little, long time guides for Northwest Rafting Company. We had the opportunity this fall to go to the Kingdom of Bhutan and explore a culturally diverse country high in the Himalayas. We left Bhutan with a commitment to start this page, tell the story of Chencho and Thinley, and raise enough money to bring them to Oregon for the same type of opportunity we had.</p> <p>While in Bhutan, we led two guided tours with American travelers and worked side by side with our counterparts in Bhutan. While there we embraced the culture, explored famous Dzongs, monasteries, and watched as western culture blended with the long standing traditions of Bhutan. Lifelong friendships were created working and boating with our Bhutanese guides. Being a country with a Gross National Happiness, the Bhutanese strive to make those around them happy so they can be happy. Our guides generously showed us this attitude and by shared their culture. We want to return the hospitality. This page is dedicated to the Bhutanese guides and providing a life changing trip for them to travel to the US to be immersed in our culture and explore our rivers.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1513641218/qbz6jgzfw0ub2whwzn5g.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Chencho and Thinley have been guides and kayakers for 10 years, paddling rivers throughout Bhutan, even making some first descents. They have never left their country. Bhutan is a country where wealth is measured by happiness and western influences are just recently becoming prevalent. The people of Bhutan do not have an excess of money. The goal of this fundraiser is to raise money to bring Chencho and Thinley to Oregon, specifically the Columbia River Gorge and Southern Oregon next spring, to paddle the rivers we know best and expand their knowledge of professional river guiding.</p> <p>After watching the short video, we hope… 1. You will be envious and want to go to Bhutan. 2. You won’t be able to avoid the contagious smiles of Chencho and Thinley and see what badass kayakers they are. 3. Hopefully feel generous and willing to share your wealth by kicking in a few bucks.</p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>

<h2>The Importance of Our Campaign</h2>
<p>Stembis.com is an e-commerce startup located in Ottawa, Canada. Similar to many businesses in the cannabis industry, our team anxiously waited for the legalization of recreational Cannabis. We saw a need to incorporate modern design and an interactive user experience in order to help businesses grow and change the way consumers shop… for the better. Instead of creating a marketplace where any product can be listed, our team focuses on quality, to create a trusted source. It’s important to us that the marketplace exemplifies a level of sophistication that matches our makers’ quality and our enthusiasts’ expectations.</p>
<p>The current cannabis landscape is filled with uncomfortable stores and an overwhelming amount of noise from bulk purchasing sites, which makes the quest to find unique and well-designed accessories difficult. We are cutting out all of the second-guessing and endless searchings, with a marketplace that has all of your quality cannabis accessories in one place.</p>
<p>We understand how frustrating operating in this space can be (at times), and the challenges many businesses have encountered, even after legalization. Some businesses have been rejected from e-commerce sites (accessory brands included). Others have been unable to receive funding, or have been turned down by media companies in order to showcase their brand publicly. While others have been fined and banned from social media. This is why we created Stembis.com, for the cannabis community to continually expand and grow, without judgment.</p>
<p>With your donations, our generous makers are gifting their products to you. All of our makers create and distribute modern, designer products. These gifts include high-quality accessories like decorative rolling papers, stylish travelers (Italian leather and vegan), and sophisticated smoke boxes. Help us create a memorable experience driven by art and design to excite your inner <i>cannasseur</i><i>.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The Magnitude of Your Contributions</strong></h2>
<p>We want to build a platform where makers and enthusiasts can connect in a meaningful way and evolve the industry together... but there are still barriers to overcome. Stembis.com believes that through design and artistry, we can create an experience that best reflects and represents the truth about the culture, to ultimately reduce stigmas. We can't wait to bring our marketplace to life where you can shop in one location for beautiful, high-quality, modern products.</p> <p>For our enthusiasts we want to create:</p>
<ul>
<li>An easy shopping solution to find all your desired products in one location</li>
<li>Access to trusted, hand-crafted, designer products</li>
<li>Concierge-style customer service.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>For our makers we want to create:</p>
<ul>
<li>A place to expand and grow, so you can reach enthusiasts who are looking for your products</li>
<li>A hassle-free, turn-key setup, and the ability to start merchandising products immediately</li>
<li>A marketplace geared to help our makers gain traction and build further momentum in the space.</li>
</ul> <p>With your support, the Stembis.com community can usher in a new era of Cannabis to move beyond the past.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2><b>How Your Donations Help</b></h2>
<p>As a startup our funding is limited, and the cost associated with developing, hosting and managing a marketplace like this are high. We need your help in order to deliver the level of sophistication you deserve. We aim to raise at least $15,000, which will be used to purchase our makers’ gifts to you (including shipping), further development, design and hosting. Initial marketing costs, such as paying for the creation of our crowdfunding video, has priority. A special shoutout to Neil Dowling, a talented filmmaker!</p>

<h3>What Happens to Donations If We Don't Reach Our Goal</h3>
<p>“Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars.”</p>
<p>Reaching our entire goal would be monumental for us and the community we are trying to grow. We understand, however, we may land among the stars and we'll need to prioritize. In this case, the allocation of funds will go to our talented filmmaker, Neil Dowling, as well as our generous makers who provided gifts to you.</p>
<p>As a startup, reaching our full goal will help us greatly. We will focus on engaging a rockstar resource to improve the UX and UI of our explore portal (this is where makers and enthusiasts can build a long-lasting relationship through engagement -- think of it in terms of bridging the best parts of Pinterest, Snapchat, and Facebook). We will enlist the help of an experienced database engineer to bring all of our siloed databases into a single, serviceable one. With this, we can then truly provide a tailor-made customer experience for our enthusiasts.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>Our team wants to push the cannabis industry to unparalleled new heights where enthusiasts get more, and makers get recognized. We want to deliver a wide selection of designer and hand-crafted accessories that reflect your modern style. We embrace a contemporary perspective, and with the help of our talented makers, we aim to remove stigmas and change perceptions of the cannabis industry.</p> <p>We come from a diverse background of business, product development, marketing, consulting, and customer relations. We have previously worked in e-commerce, tech, health &amp; wellness, and advertising &amp; marketing agencies/companies. Each team member believes in this industry, for a plethora of reasons. We are all enthusiasts who want to create the modern commerce experience for the cannabis industry that is driven by art and design and incorporates innovative technology.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>We had trouble finding one place to purchase unique, premium accessories that complement modern taste... so we built one. Stembis.com reflects contemporary style and a progressive view of the cannabis industry... but building a marketplace is a long and risky journey; it takes a lot of time, money, and coffee.</p>
<p><br/>As a startup, we will continue to enhance the marketplace for you (with or without donations). With donations, we can improve the quality we present to you and establish a community that you can trust. And let's be real, with the Cannabis Act, marketing regulations and spreading awareness is tough, so we need to get creative to reach fabulous supporters like you.</p>

What Happens to Donations If We Don't Reach Our Goal
“Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars.”
Reaching our entire goal would be monumental for us and the community we are trying to grow. We understand, however, we may land among the stars and we'll need to prioritize. In this case, the allocation of funds will go to our talented filmmaker, Neil Dowling, as well as our generous makers who provided gifts to you.
As a startup, reaching our full goal will help us greatly. We will focus on engaging a rockstar resource to improve the UX and UI of our explore portal (this is where makers and enthusiasts can build a long-lasting relationship through engagement -- think of it in terms of bridging the best parts of Pinterest, Snapchat, and Facebook). We will enlist the help of an experienced database engineer to bring all of our siloed databases into a single, serviceable one. With this, we can then truly provide a tailor-made customer experience for our enthusiasts.
 

The Impact
Our team wants to push the cannabis industry to unparalleled new heights where enthusiasts get more, and makers get recognized. We want to deliver a wide selection of designer and hand-crafted accessories that reflect your modern style. We embrace a contemporary perspective, and with the help of our talented makers, we aim to remove stigmas and change perceptions of the cannabis industry. We come from a diverse background of business, product development, marketing, consulting, and customer relations. We have previously worked in e-commerce, tech, health & wellness, and advertising & marketing agencies/companies. Each team member believes in this industry, for a plethora of reasons. We are all enthusiasts who want to create the modern commerce experience for the cannabis industry that is driven by art and design and incorporates innovative technology.
 

 

Risks & Challenges
We had trouble finding one place to purchase unique, premium accessories that complement modern taste... so we built one. Stembis.com reflects contemporary style and a progressive view of the cannabis industry... but building a marketplace is a long and risky journey; it takes a lot of time, money, and coffee.
As a startup, we will continue to enhance the marketplace for you (with or without donations). With donations, we can improve the quality we present to you and establish a community that you can trust. And let's be real, with the Cannabis Act, marketing regulations and spreading awareness is tough, so we need to get creative to reach fabulous supporters like you.

 And also a lot of other similar events have to be done.Therefore I ask everybody, who has got acquainted with the informational gist of my appeal, to inform their families, friends and acquaintances about it to reach maximum amount of potential SPONSORS.Because in this world targeted audience which is spiritually close to me consists of ≈ 2,5 billion of Christians,for whom this subject has to be interesting and clear.Appeal of the Holy Pope Francis to Christians. Vatican. Christians near the Cathedral of Christ the Savior. Moscow. Christians are near the statue of Christ the Redeemer. Rio de Janeiro. Notre Dame Cathedral. Paris. Head of the Anglican Christian Church Elizabeth II at the Divine Liturgy. London. So, even if only a hundredth part sides with me and come forward with my appeal and everybody supports and gives at least one dollar in the name of victory of light over the evil, as a result it will be acomplete guarantee that all the assigned tasks , connected with this great spiritual idea, will be necessarily solved.As a first step I have to raise $ 250.000. And that is why I reckon on a serious help of as many SPONSORS as it can be.In order that I could go ahead with continuing my mission for a successful achievement of the goal which was set to the greatest possible extent.Because in the spiritual dimension this truly great and glorious matter should become a Super-Project of the third Millennium.The exhibition of the painting ""Adam and Eve in Paradise"" - ""Glorification of God "". The Krasnoyarsk region. Russia. The picture ""Adam and Eve in Paradise"" at the exhibition ""History of the Russian State"". Moscow. Consequently, let’s all together, in other words by the whole world, at this precise point in time do everything to beat the evil one without postponing this truly important affair neither for a day nor for a thousand years!!!So that as a result everybody, having a great psychic income, could legitimately and wholeheartedly tellabout themselves: ‘I’ve helped - and we’ve done it!!!’.This is all in behalf of the fact that we absolutely cannot let it be in such a disgusting for the truth way, the doctrine about the devil and satan, that he used to be the highest and the most perfect Angel of light from the beginning, which has been accepted in the world Christian dogmatic theology from old times.Because such dogma absolutely is not a redemptive goodness for the Holy mother - ecumenical Church!!!And therefore, unless we do it ourselves, nobody will do it instead of us!!!However, when we raise the truth of God worthily, God will raise us in the same way, as it is truly acceptable before Him!!!As it is really acceptable before God that we refuse our previous delusions in time as well as turn to the holy verity and the truth of God in time!!!Because everything should be done at the time, and on time!!!",19.0,0,"1 Campaign

Le abitazioni saranno ristrutturate usando metodi e materiali naturali della tradizione e con tutti i comfort di una casa contemporanea.A Wonder Grottole troverai:● Un borgo storico autentico tutto da esplorare● Delle residenze speciali rigenerate da edifici pieni di storie● Una community, locale e internazionale, con cui mettersi in rete● Dei momenti di convivialità (cene, feste, camminate, raccolta delle olive...)● Un patrimonio immenso di tradizioni, storie, paesaggi, profumi, sapori, cultura materiale.● Un territorio in cui sperimentare delle azioni concrete (organizzare una festa, creare un laboratorio di terracotta, sperimentare delle nuove forme di mobilità…) You for Wonder Grottole You can come to Wonder Grottole to stay with us, to have fun, to establish close relationships with those who live here, to create events (like a party, why not even celebrate your own birthday!), and to experience community activities (e.g. maybe opening an old wine cellar and creating a home restaurant for a day?). You can invite friends and other people to visit you!We ask you to support us in the creation of this shared residency space that will be the starting point to bring people together, all based on the desire to switch off, being outdoors and enjoying the slow life and strong relationships that eventually will last for a lifetime.///Potrai venire a Wonder Grottole per stare insieme a noi, per divertirti, instaurare rapporti stretti con chi vive qui, inventarti delle cose da fare qui (tipo una festa, perché no festeggiare anche il tuo compleanno!) sperimentare delle attività da fare con la community (ad esempio aprire una vecchia cantina e creare per un giorno un home restaurant?), potrai invitare amici e altre persone a venirti a trovare!Ti chiediamo di sostenerci per realizzare questo spazio di condivisione con residenze che creeranno il punto di partenza per aggregare persone, tutto basato sulla voglia di staccare la spina, stare all’aria aperta e godersi la vita lenta e le relazioni forti che durano, poi, una vita. Basilicata  Basilicata is a land full of charm and opportunity, full of cultural and landscape contradictions, which make diversity the most fascinating element of its beauty.Since 2013 we have travelled all over the region and we created a map with all the active people and projects in the territory. Today this map is an incredible resource that we will make available to visitors and supporters of Wonder Grottole, to create connections, networks and relationships.///La Basilicata è una terra piena di fascino e opportunità, piena di contraddizioni culturali e paesaggistiche, che fanno della diversità l’elemento più affascinante della sua bellezza.Matera, Basilicata Dal 2013 abbiamo viaggiato per tutto il territorio e abbiamo creato una mappa con tutte le persone e le realtà attive sul territorio, oggi questa mappatura è una risorsa incredibile che metteremo a disposizione di chi verrà a Wonder Grottole, per creare connessioni, corti circuiti e relazioni. What will we do with the money? Houses in Grottole are not expensive. With € 20,000 we can buy two houses, with another €20,000 we can renovate them, and with a further € 10000 we can manage the start-up phase.If we reach our goal of € 50000, we will have enough money to have comfortable and flexible spaces to start the project. If we raise € 65000, we can buy another piece of land to create an outdoor space, for beautiful summer events. We’re also hoping to have an agricultural field where dedicate ourselves to production, conversations and simply enjoy the wonderful Italian sun.If we reach € 80000, we will buy an olive grove so we could produce olive oil for the community of Wonder Grottole.Come on! Help us to make Wonder Grottole real!///Le case non sono costose a Grottole. Possiamo avere due case per € 20.000, con altri € 20.000 possiamo ristrutturarle e con 10.000€ gestiamo la fase di startup. Se raggiungiamo il nostro obiettivo di € 50.000, avremo abbastanza soldi per disporre di spazi confortevoli e flessibili per iniziare il progetto.Se arriviamo a 65.000 €, potremmo acquistare un'ulteriore pezzo di terreno per creare uno spazio esterno da sfruttare soprattutto nella bella stagione. Inoltre sarebbe fantastico avere un campo agricolo per dedicarci alla produzione, conversare e goderci il meraviglioso sole italiano. Se raggiungiamo gli 80.000 € compreremo un uliveto così potremmo produrre l’ olio d'oliva per la comunità di Wonder Grottole.Dai, vieni! Aiutaci a rendere Wonder Grottole reale! The Impact Wonder Grottole is an experiment that can generate a great positive impact on the territory, because:- It contributes to the rehabilitation of the historic centre of the country- It reconnects the threads of tradition and life in contact with nature, and simplicity to modern paths of life - which often too fast and needs more balance.- It connects people who bring their knowledge and time to Wonder Grottole, for the purpose of imagining new futures with the local community, innovating existing activities, and experimenting with new human and technological relationships and housing solutions.///Wonder Grottole è un esperimento che può generare un gran impatto sul territorio perchè:- Contribuisce a riabitare il centro storico del paese,- Riconnette i fili della tradizione e della vita a contatto con la natura e con la semplicità a percorsi di vita nuovi, a velocità spesso troppo alte che cercano nuovi equilibri.- Aggrega persone che portano i propri saperi a Wonder Grottole, il proprio tempo, per immaginare nuovi futuri con la comunità locale, per innovare le attività esistenti, per sperimentare nuove relazioni umane e tecnologiche, nuove soluzioni abitative. Together We Can Do It! This project brings together a large team of people.

<li>Attached is a document that sets out the budget and its requirements. This gives an indication of the amount needed in order to execute all three marches perfectly. The costs of organizing such a complex and coordinated event are very high.</li>

<li>The use of funds is laid out in the documents attached on the bottom of this campaign proposal. The impact we are hoping for is to make even more people aware of this great cause and to get the general population to understand the benefits of cannabis.</li>
</ul><h3><u><strong>These include:</strong></u></h3><ul>
<li>
<strong>Health benefits </strong>– cannabis has been proven to treat, and in many cases cure, diseases such as cancer, epilepsy, parkinson’s disease and many other dread diseases, too numerous to mention.</li>
<li>
<strong>Economic benefits</strong> – Cannabis will be cultivated under controlled conditions, creating jobs for thousands of people and helping to relieve our current high unemployment rate.</li>
<li>
<strong>Environmental benefits</strong> – Cannabis is completely biodegradable and can be used as an alternative to plastics, thus reducing harmful pollution to our rivers, oceans and landfills. In addition it can also be used in the manufacture of textiles, paper, and can even be used in the production of building materials, which will lead to cheaper housing and ‘green’ houses which are more environmentally friendly.</li>
<li>
<strong>Crime reduction</strong> – If cannabis is decriminalized, it will free the police up to investigate far more serious crimes. It will also ease the plight of those trapped in the misery of unemployment. As we all well know, unemployment is a perfect breeding ground for crime. Your donation will ensure that we can move forward at a much quicker pace, thereby enabling more lives to be saved, more jobs to be created and equality for all. I believe that this project should be important to all South Africans because of the magnitude of the difference this will make in the lives of many people in our great country, from all walks of life. It will give hope to thousands of cancer sufferers as well as others with the dreaded diseases which have thus far defeated doctors, scientists and medical science.</li>
</ul><h2><u><strong>Risks and Challenges</strong></u></h2><ul>
<li>At Bongalong we believe in being open and honest. We face very real challenges on a daily basis when it comes to fighting for the cause. There is a huge push back from Big Pharma, a misinformed public, and our oh-so competent Government that seeks to delay us at every turn!</li>
<li>We firmly believe, however, that we can overcome all these obstacles if we can reach the masses through our education programme. These issues will be addressed via the social movement of which you, as a donor, will form the basis.</li>
<li>With our huge market presence, culture and community based activations we believe that if we all stand up for what is right, we will push this cause towards a fair and positive outcome. An outcome where we can save lives and uplift South Africa as a whole. <strong>So, once again we encourage you to join us!</strong>

<h3>This is a funding campaign for 4 unique and Independently designed Catalan Independence T-Shirts</h3>
<p>I work in Barcelona, mostly with Catalan people, and I love the passion they have for their independence. This inspired me to create a series of designs, celebrating this drive for independence.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503132900/n4giblxkhioj7bzvgfph.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The reason I'm making these shirts, is because I'd love to see people turn out on September 11, or on voting day, proudly wearing something that expresses their passion, and message. Having looked around for official shirts, I didn't see anything that I thought captured the passion that I felt from my co-workers and friends.</p>

<p>I have a quote on hold with a screen printing company, and I'm ready to put in my first order as soon as I hit the first funding goal. I'm aiming to reach the goal ASAP, as I'd love to get the shirts to people before September 11, and I've been assured by the printing company that this is possible, with the dates I've set. </p>

<h3> </h3>
<p>A core team of independent artists and organizers, including Manoj Kesavan, Quentin Talley, Matt Cosper and Camerin Watson, first got the idea for BOOM in 2014. Despite a minuscule budget, the first BOOM (2016) got an incredible response from the community, with coverage from every major Charlotte news outlet and an attendance of over 1,000. Since then, BOOM has grown to , over 100 performances and over 15,000 attendees annually. </p>
<p>BOOM is bigger than a performing arts festival. For the past few years, the city of Charlotte has reeled from reports listing it last in the nation for economic mobility. Those born poor in this New South city are likely to never rise economically. One of BOOM’s missions is to change that through exposure to and support of the arts. BOOM Festival showcases dozens of visual, musical, theatrical and spoken word performers, more than half of the artists are people of color—fitting the demographics of the city. Not only is there proper representation, but many of the installations are interactive, encouraging all to tap into their inner creativity and become part of the artistic expression. With community support, we are changing the story of Charlotte from one of stagnation to one of incredible opportunity. Together, we are making Charlotte BOOM!</p>
<p><strong>The Vision</strong></p>
<p>A three-day event for attendees and artists to share an out-of-body arts experience</p>
<p>This includes musical performances, theatrical shows, poetry, dance, interactive installations, communal creation, and more. All ages, ethnicities, orientations and abilities take part in this together, strengthening community bonds through support of the arts.  We keep entrance accessible to all by offering much of the festival for FREE and ticketed event are only $10, with discounts when you buy a 5 Show or Weekend Pass.  We know that access to art and culture is fundamental right for all, not a privilege for a few, but in order to offer such amazing work to so many we need your help.  BOOM can't happen without your support. </p>

<h3>Why Alcohol Free?</h3>
<p>We now stock over 125 alcohol free drinks from all over the world, but the vast majority are made here in the UK. Long gone are the days of boring, chemically tasting drinks, alcohol free drinks have burst into life. Some of the wines and beers have even won awards against alcoholic equivalents and the ever growing range of spirits are creating brand new flavours and ways to enjoy drinks booze free!</p>
<h3>About Wise Bartender</h3>
<p>We are a family start-up company based in the South West. Me, Tom along with my wife Bia and dad Kim have searched for the best alcohol free drinks. We want to make these drinks as accessible as possible and attend as many markets, events and festivals as possible bringing you the latest and greatest drinks to try.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In 2018 our purpose made bar and single gazebo did a fantastic job of introducing alcohol free drinks to around 200,000 people...but we want to go bigger with more drinks! We are trying to raise £5,000, this will purchase:</p>
<ul>
<li>one 6x3m gazebo</li>
<li>four interlocking 3x3m gazebos</li>
<li>four very different custom made bars</li>
<li>Flags and Banners to promote the pop up bar</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully your starting to get the picture, we want one big gazebo (the drinking area) with four smaller ones dotted around. We want to create a relaxed sociable space where you enjoy alcohol free drinks and all being well a bit sun :) </p>
<p>In return we have teamed up with some great brands to thank you for your pledges this includes glasses from Pistonhead brewery, tote bags and t-shirts &amp; bottle openers from Adnams. There is also the opportunity to be one of two annual bar sponsors :) </p>
</div><div>
<h3>But Why</h3>
<p>We aren't on a crusade to stop people drinking alcohol, but we do want to give people choice. For many people alcohol free drinks are very new and this is a great way for them to be introduced. For others who are already fans of the drinks this is great way to try new flavours and socialise with friends.</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can contribute thats great, but no worries if not please share the campaign and tell family and friends! Hopwefully soon we will be visiting a town near you!</p>

<p><strong>Intro:</strong></p>
<p>My name is <strong>Aryeh Capella</strong> and I'm from Colombia with a ten year experience as social activist in many areas like animal rights or peace. I was one of the activists who built a <strong>Peace Campament in the Bolivar Square</strong> after the defeat of the ""Yes"" option in the Colombian peace agreement referendum and now I want to make a new effort in that line.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>Why am I doing this project?</strong></i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Today Colombia has a final peace agreement with the FARC-EP guerilla and another peace agreement is being intended with the ELN guerilla. So, the time has come to look to the present and the future without forgetting, but without focusing in the past. Today is time to know and to recognize all the stories at the margin of History, discover the treasures and the peoples hidden behind years of war, to appreciate antagonistic ideas and ideologies, some simultaneously so close and so far away, that their existence seemed impossible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>SUMA-PAZ </strong>is a project that seeks to show current stories of how people do live daily in places which were only visited to emphasize war and its consequences. This project is a look at the people who construct peace every day without fuss and without expecting any reward. The <strong>SUMA-PAZ</strong> team seeks through written and audiovisual documents to show those forgotten experiences and stories that do not cross beyond a gossip or some Indy Media.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>How will the funds be spent? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In this stage we are a team of only four people, and ask for financiation for:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Costs related to research logistics in the field: stay, food and equipment insurance, in addition to rental of cameras and recording equipment.</li>
<li>Costs of production and printing of final material.</li>
<li>Legal creation expenses and minimum maintenance expenses of an <strong>umbrella NGO</strong> that will continue <strong>in the long term (at least five years</strong>) with the entire project.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><i>What will happen after the funds are raised?</i></strong></p>
<p> </p>

</div></div>","Intro:
My name is Aryeh Capella and I'm from Colombia with a ten year experience as social activist in many areas like animal rights or peace. I was one of the activists who built a Peace Campament in the Bolivar Square after the defeat of the ""Yes"" option in the Colombian peace agreement referendum and now I want to make a new effort in that line.
 
Why am I doing this project?
 
Today Colombia has a final peace agreement with the FARC-EP guerilla and another peace agreement is being intended with the ELN guerilla. So, the time has come to look to the present and the future without forgetting, but without focusing in the past. Today is time to know and to recognize all the stories at the margin of History, discover the treasures and the peoples hidden behind years of war, to appreciate antagonistic ideas and ideologies, some simultaneously so close and so far away, that their existence seemed impossible.
 
SUMA-PAZ is a project that seeks to show current stories of how people do live daily in places which were only visited to emphasize war and its consequences. This project is a look at the people who construct peace every day without fuss and without expecting any reward. The SUMA-PAZ team seeks through written and audiovisual documents to show those forgotten experiences and stories that do not cross beyond a gossip or some Indy Media.
 
How will the funds be spent? 
 
In this stage we are a team of only four people, and ask for financiation for:
 

Costs related to research logistics in the field: stay, food and equipment insurance, in addition to rental of cameras and recording equipment.
Costs of production and printing of final material.
Legal creation expenses and minimum maintenance expenses of an umbrella NGO that will continue in the long term (at least five years) with the entire project.

 
What will happen after the funds are raised?
 
When the goal is met immediately Suma-Paz will be constituted as a permanent NGO, so that it has an umbrella organization of the project. A maximum of fifteen days after obtaining the funds, we will leave for three weeks to the first area where we will fulfill the work of documentation of stories. Ninety days after the goal we will officially present the final materials, printed and audiovisual, to fulfill our main objective. However, in case of not achieving the goal, the funds will be donated to projects that fulfill the dissemination of stories and experiences related to peace in Colombia.
 
I want to thank you a bunch for taking the time to read this and I can't wait to start this project with all of you, friends of the good colombian people.
 
Thanks from my heart,

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>We <strong>empower nomadic communities</strong>, too often marginalized by governments and settled folks. Their know-how, traditions, relations to the environment are unique, endangered, and need to be sustained.  </p>
<p>As a newly established eco-tourism and the organic market, we aim to preserve the nomadic lifestyle by organizing Kooch (transhumance) tours with nomad families and sell numerous of their organic produce and handicrafts on our online store.<br/>Our work contributes to :<br/>- Bring <strong>supplementary income </strong>to nomad families</p>
<p>-Teach values of nomads' <strong>minimalist lifestyle</strong> to travelers<br/>- Grow nomad people’s<strong> self-esteem</strong> about their lifestyle<br/>- Reinforce the pride in their <strong>heritage</strong><br/>- Support the continuing of <strong>traditional customs</strong><br/>- Promote the role <strong>nomadic lifestyle</strong> has in the preservation of Iran's unique <strong>ecosystem</strong></p>
<p>However, due to Covid19, we have been unable to conduct tours in partnership with nomad families. The online <strong>IRANomad Market</strong> started in the global Covid-19 pandemic as a solution to keep our social business alive, pursuing both the social goal of ""revival of the nomadic intangible assets"" and the business goal of ""financial independence"".  Today, your support means everything in our goal of <strong>saving Iran's indigenous people</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We need you to support our efforts to maintain, despite all current difficulties, our goals of <strong>supporting nomadic communities</strong> and families. To achieve this, we need :<br/>- a committed team working<br/>- means to develop the nomad market for sharing their productions<br/>- communication tools and content to share the uniqueness of the nomadic lifestyle</p>
<p><br/>As a sign of gratitude for your support, we will offer you unique and personal gifts.  These gifts are 100% natural and hand-made, living proofs of the traditional handicrafts and special relations with the environment of the nomads. Coming straight from nomad families, these gifts will be a special acknowledgment of your commitment.</p>
<p><strong>Attention:</strong> Keep in mind that some countries have customs regulations that ban the import of dried herbs and honey from other countries (like Australia). Please look up the customs regulations in your country before getting a perk. If you purchase a perk that can't be shipped to your country, you can change the perk or have your money returned. </p>

<p><strong>How It All Started:</strong></p>
<p>It was around three and a half years ago when we, a group of friends, went trekking with a Bakhtiari nomad family. After that, it occurred to us that we can work to stop the imminent extinction of this authentic nomadic lifestyle. So, we got the idea of creating a social business, to kindle a sense of self-esteem in the nomads in a way that they continue their precious lifestyle. In other words, they do not abandon their tents for living in cities.<br/>Read more about us: <a href=""https://nomad.tours/other/21130/a-brief-history-of-iranomad/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://nomad.tours/other/21130/a-brief-history...</a></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Our Story During Years</p>
<p>So, we came up with a complementary model for rural development. The decision was made after consultation with professional anthropologists and professors. You can read their quotations in the following pictures.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Who Are We?</strong></p>
<p>IRANomad consists of three different groups working towards the same goal which is <strong>preserving</strong> <strong>micro-cultures</strong>, <strong>empowering nomads,</strong> and <strong>rural development</strong>. These three business lines will be explained in more details in the following paragraphs:</p>
<p><strong>1. IRANomad Tours</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Environmentally and culturally <strong>sustainable tours</strong> based in Iran with a focus on nomads and nomadic culture</li>
<li> An <strong>authentic</strong> and <strong>unfiltered,</strong> rarely-witnessed side of Iran that focuses on Iran’s indigenous people: the nomads</li>
<li>A <strong>supplementary income</strong> for nomad families in the form of tourism</li>
<li>Live like a nomad and become a part of a nomadic family: ""<strong>Nomads' Odyssey</strong>"" is our featured experience with the most authentic nomads of Iran: the Bakhtiari people</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. IRANomad Market</strong></p>
<ul>

</div></div>","Short Summary
We empower nomadic communities, too often marginalized by governments and settled folks. Their know-how, traditions, relations to the environment are unique, endangered, and need to be sustained.  
As a newly established eco-tourism and the organic market, we aim to preserve the nomadic lifestyle by organizing Kooch (transhumance) tours with nomad families and sell numerous of their organic produce and handicrafts on our online store.Our work contributes to :- Bring supplementary income to nomad families
-Teach values of nomads' minimalist lifestyle to travelers- Grow nomad people’s self-esteem about their lifestyle- Reinforce the pride in their heritage- Support the continuing of traditional customs- Promote the role nomadic lifestyle has in the preservation of Iran's unique ecosystem
However, due to Covid19, we have been unable to conduct tours in partnership with nomad families. The online IRANomad Market started in the global Covid-19 pandemic as a solution to keep our social business alive, pursuing both the social goal of ""revival of the nomadic intangible assets"" and the business goal of ""financial independence"".  Today, your support means everything in our goal of saving Iran's indigenous people.

How It All Started:
It was around three and a half years ago when we, a group of friends, went trekking with a Bakhtiari nomad family. After that, it occurred to us that we can work to stop the imminent extinction of this authentic nomadic lifestyle. So, we got the idea of creating a social business, to kindle a sense of self-esteem in the nomads in a way that they continue their precious lifestyle. In other words, they do not abandon their tents for living in cities.Read more about us: https://nomad.tours/other/21130/a-brief-history...

Our Story During Years
So, we came up with a complementary model for rural development. The decision was made after consultation with professional anthropologists and professors. You can read their quotations in the following pictures.

 
Who Are We?
IRANomad consists of three different groups working towards the same goal which is preserving micro-cultures, empowering nomads, and rural development. These three business lines will be explained in more details in the following paragraphs:
1. IRANomad Tours

Environmentally and culturally sustainable tours based in Iran with a focus on nomads and nomadic culture
 An authentic and unfiltered, rarely-witnessed side of Iran that focuses on Iran’s indigenous people: the nomads
A supplementary income for nomad families in the form of tourism
Live like a nomad and become a part of a nomadic family: ""Nomads' Odyssey"" is our featured experience with the most authentic nomads of Iran: the Bakhtiari people

2. IRANomad Market

An online shop focused on selling organic nomadic produce such as dairy products and wild herbs
 Collected and provided by the nomads
 Selling nomadic products straight from the nomads to the customers
Helping the sustainability of nomadic lifestyle by providing a supplementary income
Bringing recognition to the nomadic families and their heritage by sharing their story with the customers in each purchase

3. IRANomad Cultural House

Café and hub for travel and culture-enthusiasts
Charming traditional house in Tehran’s oldest neighborhood
A place to host our nomadic friends and return the hospitality 
Introducing the different nomadic cultures in Iran by organizing workshops, seminars, and talks hosted by other avid travelers

How Do We Help to Preserve Nomadic Lifestyle?
In our work model, the social goal of «Preserving the Nomadic Lifestyle» is valued above all. Here are two examples in the tours and market section that showcase how we try to make each nomadic family an independent unit so that they can become financially self-sufficient even if they choose not to work with us.
1-Sustainability, small group travel, responsible visitors, respect of traditional culture: these are the main principles that we live by in our business. We also take in mind to bring travelers to different families so that no family abandons their actual nomadic life to only make money from tourism.
2-In IRANomad Market, our goal is to make nomads financially independent, in a sustainable way. We cut out all middlemen, and sell the authentic nomadic products straight from the nomads to the customers, ensuring that our nomad partners get the maximum benefit from the sales. Moreover, we tell the story of these nomadic families to every person who makes a purchase. 

Our Strengths & Challenges

<h2><strong>The Vision</strong></h2>
<p>We created an event to bring back the once famous suburb Sophiatown of the 40´s and 50´s! We want people to actively dive back into the mood of an outstanding era. We want them to experience the vibe this suburb radiated.</p>
<p>Through dance workshops, literature readings, and other cultural activities visitors can experience actively what Sophiatown was about. The event will peek in a concert with famous South African artists that will pay tribute to the musical legacy of Sophiatown.</p>
<p>Included in every ticket is a</p>
<ul>
<li>guided tour with Sophiatown expert Mbali Zwane</li>
<li>a dance workshop with professional dancers teaching Township Jive and Marabi</li>
<li>a literature workshop telling Sophiatown´s story through important authors</li>
<li>a visit in a Sophiatown museum.</li>
</ul>
<p>After the cultural activities people have time to relax with food and drinks and get ready for the show with South Africa´s famous Jazz artists:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mc Coy Mrubata</li>
<li>Sibongile Khumalo</li>
<li>Sibusiso Lerole</li>
</ul>
<p>The concert will be accompanied by a photo show with pictures of Sophiatown Photographer Jürgen Schadeberg. </p>
<p>With this event we hope to evoke worldwide recognition for the rich cultural and political heritage of Sophiatown. We hope that this will become an annual event. We hope to contribute to the further development of Sophiatown and therefore educate people about the impact this suburb had on South African history.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The Background</strong></h2>
<p><i>“Mayibuye”</i> translates to <i>“come back”</i>. Sophiatown in the 1940´s and 1950´s was rich in arts and culture. Its inhabitants had created a lifestyle that would shape African urban life and culture for ever. Though segregational issues were already on the rise in South Africa, in Sophiatown people of any skin colour and origin lived together in this neighbourhood. Sophiatown was crowded and people were rather poor, but it brimmed with rich life.</p>
<p>Its Shebeens (*illegal bars established in houses of so called Shebeen Queens) were the meeting point for the neighbourhood, political activists, writers, journalists, photographers, musicians and dancers. Sophiatown in the 1940´s and 1950´s became a melting pot, a unique environment where music, dance, literature, photography, language and fashion evolved as an outstanding culture and a form of political protest.</p>
<p>Many of South Africa´s most famous icons like Miriam Makeba, Hugh Masekela, Dolly Rathebe, Can Themba, Nat Nakasa, Jürgen Schadeberg, Dollar Brand and many more began their careers here. Nelson Mandela held one of its first outrageous speeches in the Odin Cinema in the famous Good Street, Sophiatown´s epicentre.</p>
<p>Jazz was the constant companion of political and cultural movements. No suprise Sophiatown was nicknamed “Little Harlem” in reference to New York´s vibrant suburb that took Jazz and African-American culture to the next level. But Sophiatown was not just a copy of Harlem. It created its own art. Jazz blent with African music to new styles like Kwela, Tsaba-Tsaba and Pennywhistle music. Swing and Jazz dances blent with African dances to Pantsula, Township Jive and Marabi.</p>
<p>It even created its own language, Tsotsitaal, that is still spoken until today in the townships all over South Africa. Famous photographers like Jurgen Schadeberg and Bob Gosani captured the daily life of Sophiatown, leaving an ever speaking footage for the generations yet to come. Writers like Nat Nakasa and Can Themba would become important witnesses that would leave an unexampled written documentary on what Sophiatown was like.</p>
<p>But as much as all those mixed cultural influences shaped its upcoming they would soon seal Sophiatown´s downfall. The Apartheid Regime who had risen to power in 1948 favoured racial segregation over anything and would establish laws to follow through with that vision. In 1955 it decided to destroy Sophiatown and remove its inhabitants to SOWETO and other townships according to their race.</p>
<p>They came at the break of dawn on the 9th of February 1955 and levelled Sophiatown to the ground. To mock Sophiatown´s people even more they named the left over area Triomf (Afrikaans for, well, triumph) and settled white people. Sophiatown was gone by any means. Though its artists mostly followed their careers in exile, and it was renamed Sophiatown in 2006, its cultural heritage never fully recovered from that stroke and some of it is considered to be lost and forgotten.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The Budget</strong></h2>
<p>In order to see our vision come to life we have calculated a budget in the total sum of ZAR 213.000 or € 14.760 . The Budget consists of the following:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498734382/alvgxj08tpljfg785upc.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The biggest part of the budget will go to the technical support. With the kind support of the renowned companies <strong>Gearhouse South Africa</strong> and <strong>Mushroom Productions </strong>we could already reduce the costs for Technical Support and Production Support by 60% from their normal quotations. The musical artists we want to work with also kindly agreed to reduced fees.</p>
<p>The costs for venue hiring will go to the Trevor Huddleston Memorial Center in Sophiatown, where the event will take place. Costs for the Photo exhibition consist of copyright fees.</p>
<p>This Chart might give you an even better understanding of how the budget will be spent:</p>

The Team
Who is pursuing this vision? Three individuals from two different continents who share one vision.

Mtsembeni Masina (left) from South Africa, 31 years old, based in Johannesburg, worked in the arts and entertainment industry as a lighting auto technician and sound engineer for 10 years. He produces films for the past 4 years.
""I have been always highly involved within the arts. My music and literature appreciation was shaped by the golden era and generation of Sophiatown.""
Dr. Kristina Kreul (center) from Germany, 34 years old, based in Berlin, worked as a lawyer and branch manager in the healthcare sector for five years. Dances Flamenco for the past nine years and Lindy Hop and Solo Jazz for one year.
""As a Lindy Hop dancer I saw Sophiatown´s history with the mindset that the Lindy Hop culture, which originated in the late 1920´s, once was lost but was brought back by some few Swedes in the 1980´s. Now it is a worldwide hopping community of roughly 60.000 dancers. I am wishing for a worldwide recognition of Sophiatown and its incredible rich cultural heritage. ""
Sakhile Gumbi (right) from Swaziland, 29 years old, based in Mbabane, works as graphic designer, university lecturer and photographer. Generally gifted with creative expression, he will release his first music album soon.
""As a photographer I always was and keep on being influenced a lot by the work of Jurgen Schadeberg and Bob Gosani, photographers that captured the essence of life in Sophiatown through the camera lense.""

<p><strong>Britain's poorest town has decided to offer free breakfasts to all its primary school pupils in an extravagant first for the country.Why is that?</strong></p>
<p>Blackpool is one of the most famous seaside tourist towns in Britain.Beaches, bars and roller coasters make you linger.</p>
<p>Behind all the hype is a jarring fact: Blackpool is the sixth-poorest district in Britain.A quarter of adults are on the dole, and the rate of living off benefits is double the national average.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The ""luxury"" of a poor town</strong></p>
<p>Earlier this year, Blackpool local council teamed up with the University of North Sambria in a three-month experiment to provide free breakfasts to pupils at 33 primary schools across the region.Breakfast consists of milk, juice, bread, cereal, yogurt and fresh fruit.</p>
<p>After three months of eating, I came to the following conclusions:</p>
<p>Kids who get free breakfasts eat healthier</p>
<p>Free breakfasts can reduce inequalities in the nutritional quality of children's diets</p>
<p>Students are happier, more active and more focused</p>
<p>Attendance and class performance improved significantly</p>
<p>Parents and teachers are demanding that it be continued</p>
<p>Blackpool council has announced it will introduce free breakfasts from next year based on the results of the trial, with £1.3m earmarks to provide free nutritious breakfasts to all 12,000 primary school pupils in the borough.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>12, An hour in the day is worth breakfast</strong></p>
<p>There's a little background here.Public primary and secondary schools in Britain are required to provide lunches for their pupils.Children from poor families can apply for free meals, while other students pay a certain percentage of the cost of food.Schools are not obliged to provide breakfast.Some schools organize ""breakfast clubs"" where students pay extra for breakfast.</p>
<p>Blackpool council's decision, the first of its kind in the country, to offer free breakfasts to all schoolchildren is currently the only one.</p>
<p>Blackpool local authority leader John Blackburn says primary school teachers across the district report that many students are coming to school hungry and unable to concentrate.And as benefits have been cut, the number of students going to school hungry has increased significantly.</p>
<p>In fact, says Blackburn, the experiment proved its worth from day one: ""I'm proud that we took such a bold decision and that no other local authority has tried anything like it.I'm even prouder of the results of our experiment.</p>
<p>Hodkins, the head teacher, said children who had eaten little or no breakfast before were now able to eat a big breakfast before the start of the day and were significantly more active and alert.It is too early to say whether it will help improve academic performance, but there has been a marked improvement in students' class attention and attendance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>To feed</strong></p>
<p>Blackpool's initiative is the first of its kind in the country, but the reason for offering free breakfasts to children is not unique.</p>
<p>The Blackpool experiment comes as the Royal College of GPs, the National Association of Head Teachers and the Royal Society of Paediatrics and Child Health have joined a petition calling on the government to provide free breakfasts to pupils who qualify for free school meals.</p>
<p>Their separate surveys found that four out of five teachers reported having students in their class come to school on an empty stomach.A third of teachers said they regularly brought their own food such as biscuits and bread to keep pupils hungry.One in six primary school teachers spend an average of ￡25 a month on their own food for their children.</p>
<p>There are two main reasons why children do not eat breakfast. One is that parents do not pay attention to or have no energy to prepare breakfast, and the other is that they have no money to provide breakfast for their children.</p>
<p>The Royal College of GPs said ensuring children had a good breakfast could tackle a range of childhood illnesses caused by poor diet.</p>
<p>Eradell, president of the National Association of Head Teachers, said it was sad for children to go to school hungry.How do you study on an empty stomach?The National Association of Head Teachers is calling on the government to try offering free breakfasts to all pupils who need or are entitled to free school meals.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The pauper</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps, like Blackpool, the rich-world hat does not cover the gap between rich and poor in British society.</p>
<p>Official government figures show that one in five children in the UK live below the poverty line, one of the highest rates in any developed western country.(Britain's official poverty line is defined as a family earning less than 60% of the national average.)</p>
<p>In some traditional industrial cities, and even some parts of inner London, almost half of all children live below the poverty line.</p>
<p>The government insists its target of eradicating child poverty by 2020 remains unchanged.But efforts to lift children out of poverty have been severely hampered by deep cuts in public spending since the financial crisis.</p>
<p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies predicts that the number of children living in poverty in the UK will instead rise by 800,000 by 2020.</p>
<p>Deep cuts in public spending in Britain have forced local authorities to close and roll over many welfare and convenience programmes.In a penny to break into two spend time, spend money where, focus on what to protect?</p>
<p>One poor English town has its answer.Let's hope the free school breakfasts in Blackpool continue.</p>
<p><strong>Our free breakfasts will also keep more children from hunger and cold！！</strong></p>

<h2>Saving St. Ignatius Hospital</h2>
<p>A turn-of-the-century hospital, tucked away and abandoned in a rural town. Would you save it if you could?</p>
<p>Saint Ignatius Hospital was designed and built by fearless nun and architect, Mother Joseph. Completed in 1893, the hospital continued for decades until it was eventually decommissioned in 1968. The building continued to be used as a home for elderly and mentally disabled adults, until 2003, when it was finally abandoned.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1626135540/ijklry3hk1xrkwqkmako.png"" src=""""/><strong>Nearly 20 years of neglect have brought St. Ignatius dangerously close to ruin.</strong> The hospital has been on Washington state's ""Most Endangered"" historic buildings list since 2015. A massive hole in the west side of the roof has caused four floors to notably sag. It's difficult to tell how close we are to the “point of no return”— major structural failure which would put the building beyond reasonable repair. We need to raise the sagging floors and replace the roof soon in order to preserve the building.</p>

<h3>St. Ignatius needs your help</h3>
<p>And so do we! We're Austin and Laura Storm, and small business and historic preservation is our catnip. We currently run two independent secondhand stores—one in Moscow, Idaho, and one in Colfax, Washington. Plus we’ve got plans for a bookstore, a downtown hotel, a bar...the list goes on! But St. Ignatius Hospital trumps all those. It’s the white whale, the pearl of great price, the cherry on top, the thing that makes us mix our metaphors.</p>

<p>Now, we’re embarking on a quest larger than any we’ve yet attempted—to preserve and restore the St. Ignatius Hospital. This is an immense project, and it will literally take a village. The Whitman County Historical Society has approved the preservation of St. Ignatius as a sponsored project; we have a partnership with the Colfax Chamber who runs haunted and historic hospital tours; and thanks to all of you, an army of heartfelt volunteers and enthusiastic old-building fanatics! Together we <i>can</i> save St. Ignatius!</p>
<h3>Long-term vision</h3>
<p>St. Ignatius began as a place for others, and we want to restore it to that again. We would love to see it shine as a historic event venue and hotel, with space for artist retreats, maker classes, food &amp; drink, small businesses, and more. It'll be a long, wonderful haul to bring it back!</p>
<h3>Current goals</h3>
<p>Right now, we have two key challenges:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Retire the mortgage.</strong> We have a short-term mortgage of $50,000 which is coming due soon. Once this is paid off, it will free up funds every month to continue to do vital repairs.</li>
<li>
<strong>Roof and structural rescue.</strong> This incredible building needs time to dry out with a proper roof, but every spring, fall, and winter, it just gets hit with more rain, sleet, and snow. It's wearing the structure down, and it's unlikely that the hospital can withstand many more wet seasons without significant repairs.</li>
</ol>
<p>We realize those are both big goals, so we’re very thankful to share that an anonymous donor has pledged a generous “matching gift” of up to $50,000 for the preservation of St. Ignatius. This means that <strong>every dollar you donate during this campaign will be doubled, up to $50,000!</strong></p>

<h3>The Short, Short Version</h3>
<p>A New England Martial Arts Studio is in danger of being lost, along with the 60-year history of their Grandmaster instructor, who passed away at the beginning of 2020. Two students have found a way to get the studio back, secure the history of their teacher, and pass on his lessons to future generations.</p>
<h3>His Legacy, Our Future...</h3>
<p>On January 29, 2020, the students of the Beaudoin Academy of Karate of Waterbury, CT USA lost their Master Instructor and Academy owner, Dr. Robert E. Beaudoin. He was a prominent figure in American Martial Arts with a career that spanned six decades and ended with him being the Grandmaster of the World Tang Soo Do Association.<br/><br/>With his passing began a series of legal trials and tribulations only made more difficult by a global pandemic, resulting in the near loss of his studio, where he taught thousands of students for more than 30 years. But now we have an opportunity to return the Academy to its students, and turn it into a proper Memorial site of this amazing human being. <strong>But we need your help to make it happen.</strong></p>
<h3>
<br/>Who is Grandmaster Robert Beaudoin, what is the Academy of Karate, and Why Does it Matter?</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607034793/jthmvvlq9jwskiejtcfd.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/>While stationed in Korea with the U.S. Air Force during the Vietnam War, Robert Beaudoin started training in Tang Soo Do, a traditional Korean Martial Art and earned his black belt in 1963 under his teacher- Grandmaster Jae C.

</div></div>","The Short, Short Version
A New England Martial Arts Studio is in danger of being lost, along with the 60-year history of their Grandmaster instructor, who passed away at the beginning of 2020. Two students have found a way to get the studio back, secure the history of their teacher, and pass on his lessons to future generations.
His Legacy, Our Future...
On January 29, 2020, the students of the Beaudoin Academy of Karate of Waterbury, CT USA lost their Master Instructor and Academy owner, Dr. Robert E. Beaudoin. He was a prominent figure in American Martial Arts with a career that spanned six decades and ended with him being the Grandmaster of the World Tang Soo Do Association.With his passing began a series of legal trials and tribulations only made more difficult by a global pandemic, resulting in the near loss of his studio, where he taught thousands of students for more than 30 years. But now we have an opportunity to return the Academy to its students, and turn it into a proper Memorial site of this amazing human being. But we need your help to make it happen.

Who is Grandmaster Robert Beaudoin, what is the Academy of Karate, and Why Does it Matter?
While stationed in Korea with the U.S. Air Force during the Vietnam War, Robert Beaudoin started training in Tang Soo Do, a traditional Korean Martial Art and earned his black belt in 1963 under his teacher- Grandmaster Jae C. Shin. Not long after returning to the states, he opened the Academy of Karate in Connecticut and began training students in 1965. He would later become a charter member of the World Tang Soo Do Association in 1982. Today, the WTSDA has over 100,000 members across 36 countries. He then became Grandmaster of the Association in 2010. But the Academy was always his school and the students that trained there learned from him directly. No matter what corners of the world Association business brought him to, he always made sure to come home and teach his students. Martial Artists would come from all over the world to train at the Academy of Karate to learn from this remarkable and warm man.  He would receive gifts and lessons from the different cultures and his Academy became a Mini-Museum of his travels.The Academy of Karate is a symbol of Traditional Martial Arts in New England and for his students, some who have also become instructors and Masters over the years, it's a home and a family. 

The Passing of an Icon

Grandmaster Beaudoin's passing was sudden and unexpected. It presented a host of legal issues over who owned the multiple decades-old property and who would take over as Master Instructor, if one of the students could even regain control of the property. Multiple businesses wanted the location and didn't much care about the lineage of an aging Martial Arts school.Then two months later, the global pandemic hit. Further turmoil met the Academy as it had to close down completely until all of the red tape could be worked through. Insurance issues meant that taking care of the property wasn't allowed as ownership was in purgatory. Repairs needed to be made. If something wasn't done soon, 55 years of history would be lost. 

Someone steps up to the Plate


Enter Anthony Bracco and Dan Farrelly. Anthony is a long time local small business owner and student of the Academy for over 20 years. Dan is a Computer Science Engineer and trained under Grandmaster Beaudoin for over 30 years.

<h3>Giving All Access</h3>
<p>I'm author, editor, speaker, and entrepreneur John Edward Lawson. My background is as an award-winning publisher of cross-genre books nobody else will publish because they'll be difficult to market. A regular day for me involves making products other business people avoid, and proving those products can succeed.</p>
<p>Now I'm taking that experience, along with my work as an event planner, and launching virtual conventions, workshops, trade shows, and more…with your help.</p>
<p>This project isn't about developing a single stand-alone convention, it's about building an online platform to continually provide the experience of conventions and workshops for those who cannot attend such events in person.</p>
<p>For the first time, all members of the science fiction, fantasy, and horror communities and beyond — regardless of worldwide location, mobility, identity, or resources — will have regularly-occurring access to convention guests, vendors, keynote speeches, and networking opportunities with other fans and industry professionals through virtual events that function in the same way as in-person events.</p>
<p>All of which will be offered for a much lower price point than brick-and-mortar versions of these events, typically in the $27 to $47 range as opposed to the standard $80 to $300 plus travel, food, and accommodations.</p>
<p>Our community has members who are not just underserved, they are often mistreated or left out entirely. Your contribution will make our plan even more effective, make the scene as powerful as possible, and give you lifetime access.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How We Get There Together</h3>
<p>Here's the best part: this is all within reach. The amounts of money we're talking about are not outrageous.</p>
<p>The bare minimum to purchase the technology needed for achieving our goal is $600. That's it! At $2,000 we cover a lot of the business-related expenses that would otherwise prevent us from delivering events to you right away. Above $2,000 in funding helps establish our infrastructure and publicity efforts for reaching and working with the communities we intend to engage.</p>
<p><strong>Evergreen Attendees</strong> get free lifetime basic admission to our online events. <strong>Evergreen VIPs</strong> receive lifetime VIP admission to our online events. <strong>Evergreen Vendors</strong> unlock lifetime access to the vendor area of our online events to sell or market their product, company, or service in addition to being part of the event as an attendee. <i>UPDATE: public-facing chat is now enabled in the vendor booths so you can interact with attendees and answer their questions!</i> <strong>Evergreen Sponsors</strong> will have sponsorship status at our online events for life along with a virtual vendor booth in the expo area, in addition to having an Evergreen attendee membership. The benefits of those four contribution levels are active for any and all of our public events but may be subject to restrictions from business partners on the occasions when we cohost an event with another organization.</p>
<p><strong>Evergreen Legacy</strong> contributors get all the benefits listed above, plus we'll create a grant in your name to allow free access for people who wouldn't otherwise be able to attend our events. We administrate the grant through an easy to find, easy to understand application process. Your name becomes that of a benefactor and philanthropist.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal any money received goes into a version of this that, while good, does not allow us to support the community to the extent we know is possible. So, regardless of the outcome, your contribution brings something good to life!</p>

<h3>Your Influence</h3>
<p>Your contribution, combined with our experience, will make an immediate and valuable impact:</p>
<ul>
<li>That favorite author who lives in a remote area, that reviewer who expanded your horizons before a car crash limited their public life, that instructor who inspired your heroes before aging out of traveling the convention circuit…these people and more are waiting to hang out with you just on the other side of the donate button.</li>
<li>During our time publishing, we have successfully planned and coordinated workshops, conventions, book tours, retreats, and more with organizations, individuals, and businesses not just for ourselves and the authors we work with, but on behalf of other communities as well. With your help, we'll be able to eliminate all the associated waste and massive carbon footprint our events currently generate.</li>
<li>My personal work as vice president of Diverse Writers and Artists of Speculative Fiction, combined with my own experience, has demonstrated to me the necessity of removing barriers to entry for marginalized groups, people without extra resources, those who typically experience harassment, and people whose sobriety is put at risk in the ""party"" atmosphere of conventions hosted in hotels with bars. You deserve access to pursue your interests in the arts, career advancement, and more, with the biggest crowd possible so let's get rid of any obstacles together.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Despite a track record of operating businesses 20+ years, starting with a recording studio in the mid-1990s, there are still always challenges. Some of those include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The exact thing that makes this a great opportunity…nobody else is doing it! There are unknowns here, but looking at online summits in the information product space gives us clues as to how fandom and arts communities will respond.</li>
<li>The fact we have 20 years of experience in the business is a liability in addition to being a bonus because our other businesses are still operational and will require our attention. That's why we are using this platform to build the necessary infrastructure and team, in order to prevent budgetary confusion between businesses and to avoid overworked team members losing customer focus or giving up entirely.</li>
<li>One challenge to overcome is that our perks are only guaranteed for <strong>PUBLIC</strong> virtual events. Occasionally we will host <i>private</i> virtual events and cannot guarantee access…look, if somebody is having a private family reunion or virtual funeral service, do you really want to be there anyway? Equally important to note is that <i>if</i> we partner with another company to host an event that company <i>may</i> place restrictions on attendance. We'll work to ensure all our early adopter supporters have as much access as possible in those situations, though, since that's the point of All Access Conventions.</li>
<li>The other challenge is that while it's cool to reach unlimited thousands of attendees for life as a vendor or sponsor the above restrictions will apply for vendor/sponsor backers as well. We can't guarantee the ability to vend at or sponsor private events, or at events we cohost with other businesses. The good news is private events tend to have much smaller crowds, and cohosted events might be focused on really narrow niches outside your target audience, so you might not be missing much anyway.</li>
<li>Due to legal constraints for public events in the United States of America, we cannot accept sponsors or vendors who promote illegal activities or hate and/or violence.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other Questions</h3>
<p>If we're so great at business then why resort to crowdfunding?</p>
<p>As alluded to above we're intent on not letting down stakeholders in our established business efforts with unplanned expenditures. The opportunity to acquire the tech needed to launch this effort (massive online events that mirror real-world events, which has been a goal of ours for years) fell into our laps but time is limited for the price that is within reach for us. We're nearly there but just can't put the money together in the required timeframe.</p>
<p>So, instead of going after a loan or scrambling for investors we are taking it to the streets. This not only ensures the working capital necessary but also makes it possible to have users on board from the start, and a focus group who can help shape the way our online events develop. After all, the events are not for us, they're for the community of attendees, vendors, and sponsors.</p>
<p>You can find more in the FAQ section. If your questions aren't covered here please do reach out to us for answers! Thanks. And now, one final thing…</p>

<p>The Red Museum is an old fruit-packing warehouse on the outskirts of Mansion Flats that has transformed into an epicenter of experimentation and raw arts culture in Sacramento. We provide affordable practice/studio space to local creatives and occasionally host highly-curated events that bring people of different ages, ethnicities, genders, economic backgrounds, and tastes together to experience new music, performance, food, and visual art for a reasonable entry price. We believe in the cultural value of providing exposure for emerging artists and we never want money to be a barrier between a good artist and a successful artist. We also want the public, no matter their demographic, to have access to this culture through our events.</p>
<p>This is the fourth year (skipping 2020) we have produced the Red Ex event, which raises funds that help us continue to operate throughout the year. Simply put, this event is how we survive. We’re looking to the community for support, but we are also giving back an event that represents the diversity of the current up-and-coming talent in our city. Sacramento has a warm community of artists and art supporters who are open to experiencing new things, making our city a unique incubator for creativity.</p>
<p>The success of this project will demonstrate that there is a path to helping art spaces survive in a changing and gentrifying city. By galvanizing support from they city, local businesses, and the community, we can ensure that the future of the arts is secure here in Sacramento. The Red Ex event tickets are the foundation of this campaign and we have added other special perks from there. We appreciate any support and hope we will see you soon at The Red Museum!</p>

<p><strong><span><i>Can you support a much-needed community arts event? Periscope are excited to announce that we are preparing a brand-new creative event to be held in Stroud town centre in October 2019, drawing together members of the public, commissioned artists, speakers, researchers, youth groups and community outreach groups in a wonderful communal creative project!</i></span></strong></p>
<p>Hello! Periscope is a creative partnership between artists Alison Cockcroft and Emily Joy.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1557161041/cvvfuosnlc4bcctbhsll.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We are based in Stroud, Gloucestershire and both have many years experience of teaching in the area and nationwide. As educators and facilitators, we are passionate about breaking down barriers to participation with art and creativity and challenging hierarchies in teaching and learning.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545167700/g3bkvqlz9bgnsekkhm5a.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We are also passionate about working within our own community, and committed to the importance of art and creativity being available to everyone. We believe strongly in the power of the arts to strengthen community, empower individuals and bring about social change. As Periscope we have developed a unique methodology, which cuts through barriers including age, experience, confidence and ability. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545167916/wftzzweq7qwqqganfkp6.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Over the last 4 years we have provided 10 short duration Periscope events, reaching many hundreds of people in the area. From the 'Inventor's Workshop' to the 'Dream of the Plant Collector', Periscope have created unique spaces in which to explore and be creative.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545167625/umhbnnrauregl9vseoui.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>We are excited to announce that we are now fund-raising for a month-long event to be held in Stroud town centre in October 2019!</h2>
<p>'The Explorer's Dream' will reach a wider public and we hope will it become the start of a permanent creative presence in the town...</p>
<p><strong>WHY? </strong>We believe that non-outcome based creative provision is now crucial; in relation to cuts to arts in schools, a reduction of adult involvement with the arts, and prohibitive costs of standard art workshops.  The value of participation in the arts to support wellbeing and improve mental health is now well documented. </p>
<p>We are also excited by the possibility that open ended creativity can encourage the questioning of accepted social norms, creating alternative narratives that can empower individuals and connect people. Through a short scoping event we held in Stroud in October 2018, we could already see how by being in the town centre Periscope was reaching people who would otherwise not engage with the arts or with standard workshops.</p>
<p>We began to see what we hoped for: passers by popping in for a chat, a reminisce, some company... and being drawn gently into creative action; whether that was telling us a story, adding to a written piece, playing with some of our strange equipment and machinery to create a piece of work, or spending time drawing using some of our beautiful materials.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545172542/mg8bubmtlz2r62ygfx7l.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>SO WHAT IS IT WE ARE PLANNING? </strong></p>
<p><strong>'The Explorer's Dream' </strong>will explore how our imagination and memory create our ideas of place, wildness, the familiar and strange. A theatrical environment with props, tools and equipment will enable playful creative acts focusing on looking, making and drawing.</p>
<p>As with all Periscope events, this event will be free, drop-in, and structured to accommodate all ages and abilities.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545170443/nusyyrntable1fihjxih.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>AND THERE'S MORE! </strong></p>
<p>We are also fundraising for a <strong>one-day creative symposium</strong> which will explore Periscope’s methodology within the context of art, creativity and education. This symposium will explore ideas of creative education, social change, the reimagining of social narratives and the place of non-outcome based play, bringing together artists, researchers and theorists alongside the public of all ages. </p>
<p>Contributors and speakers include</p>
<p><strong>Dr Wendy Russell</strong> (Senior lecturer in play and play work, University of Gloucestershire) </p>
<p><strong>Sophie Christophy</strong> (consent based education)</p>
<p><strong>Rowan Salim</strong> (Director, Free we Grow; democratic and alternative education),</p>
<p><strong>Dougald Hine </strong>(Author, co-founder of Dark Mountain, Home - social change) </p>

<h2> </h2>
<p>On the evening before this exciting symposium we will be welcoming <strong>hedgespoken</strong> (Tom and Rima Staines; travelling theatre and storytelling) and their beautiful van to the Goods Shed in Stroud for an evening of imaginative travels into the known and the unknown, drawing upon myths and ancient stories and looking at our relationship to the wild - tying in with our event space theme.

<p> </p>
<h2>To make this event happen we need your generous and wonderful help!</h2>
<p>We are fundraising to cover some of our costs for this event...</p>
<p>These sorts of events are not cheap: we work many months to research, prepare and get other creative people involved. We also provide beautiful quality materials and equipment plus a lot of props to create a truly unique environment. We value our contributors, whether they are speakers at events, our photographers, technical support or artists helping us create elements of the event. </p>
<p>We also know that participants like to feel involved, and as all our events are free we know that many participants have wanted to help us continue providing these amazing and valuable experiences. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545171896/obosi8ksw5sej3ucdk0e.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>We are looking to you to help us raise £500 to cover our materials and equipment costs for this event. </strong></p>
<p>We will be buying inks, specialist clay, paper and fantastic props, and hiring projectors and buying other materials including wood and paint to create our interactive and immersive space.</p>
<p>If you can help us towards raising this initial £500 we will use it as part-funding for a larger funding bid which covers all other aspects of the event and symposium, including paying contributors and speakers, employing a local young filmmaker and a local evaluator. </p>
<p>Even if we don't reach our entire goal, all the funds raised will go into the project as planned, funding as much as we can and delivering a fantastic experience! </p>

<p><strong>Are there rewards for supporting us?</strong> </p>

<p>Those able to support us will be given a thank you gift ranging from their name featured on the supporters page on our blog, to our symposium tickets.</p>

<p>We are excited by this new project and are using it as an opportunity to fully evaluate our approach, which is why we are working with Alice Goodenough (evaluator) throughout the month long event.</p>

<h2>Who are you supporting?</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Vinotok is an autumn equinox festival celebrating nature, community and the harvest. The week of events includes a Harvest Mother Celebration at our local Farmer’s Market; a Mythology Workshop on the symbolism of our celebrations; women’s gatherings; a Storytelling evening with elders of our community; a Liar’s Night competition; an all organic, locally grown farm to table Community Feast; street theatre performances with a host of ancient and archetypal characters; and the Burning of the Grump Bonfire to release our grievances.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Support sacred activism that honors nature and community by donating to our truly grassroots, volunteer organized harvest festival. For 34-years we have celebrated the innate transitions in our world. We honor the arrival of fall and winter as well as the completion of a fleeting summer. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Support an opportunity for a community to come together to revel with each other. Pay homage to the bond between generations within our community. Share the history of the people that treasure living here. Bring forth the storytelling traditions from our community’s ancestral ranching and mining heritages, and unite them with the stories we are creating in the present.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Support a time of year where grievances against one another and ourselves are forgotten. Help us gather a community to celebrate the wildness, understand we are connected to the rhythms of nature. This will let us teach ourselves and our visitors to revere the bounty of a summer with harvest of wildflowers and food. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Support us as we gather to be thankful for what we have been given. We will dance around a fire in abandon, to let go, and begin afresh our human role in the every-cycling circle of life.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</h3>

<ul><li> ​<strong>Andy Bamberg Celebration Bonfire</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>This tradition of burning an effigy filled with the past years wrongs was first enacted by the original miners in our valley. As nonunionized workers in the early 20thcentury they were only worth their physical capacity. Once a year the mining boss would look away and allow the common people a day of protest. They would burn an image of the “boss” with impunity.</p>
<p>We continue this tradition with a bonfire in the center of our town, we invite everyone who danced in the streets with us and watched the Trial of the Grump to follow us and celebrate with a spectacle you will not see the like of anywhere else.</p>
<p>CHARACTERS</p>
<ul><li><strong>Harvest Mother</strong></li></ul>
<p>This goddess on Earth is chosen from the pregnant women in town. She is our symbol of fertility and grace. The center of the Vinotok troupe she determines the fate of the Grump. Dressed in white she speaks for the Earth and brings new life to us as winter approaches. </p>
<ul><li><strong>The Grump</strong></li></ul>
<p>In Slovenian traditions, effigies were burned on the boss man’s lawn as a rib. These effigies have morphed into the Grump, a symbol of what we want to release from the previous year – what has blocked us.  It is giving to the flames our grievances, to make room for what we want in the new year.  This utterly unique art installation takes months to plan and prepare is unveiled only on the final night of festivities. Filled with personal written wrongs of the last year, and designed to represent the threats to our environmental, and personal freedom.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Green Man</strong></li></ul>
<p>Chosen as a symbol of nature, one man each year is bestowed the honor of Green Man. He must represent qualities of joy, honesty, love, wildness, and respect. He must be of community and invested in the valley’s growth and protection. He is the symbolic partner of the Harvest Mother, and leads the trial accompanied by twelve maidens.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Red Lady</strong></li></ul>
<p>An embodiment of a geographic location, the Red Lady is chosen by our local grassroots environmental organization to provide a human element to our mountains. Constantly under threat from those who see mountains not for their beauty but for their resources this theater of activism is essential to preserving our landscapes. This individual embodies the story of the longest successful community lead preservation campaign. Our Red Lady allows the mountain to become human so that we may never forget how important she is to our landscape and community. Embody and encourage relationship to wilderness within and without. She honors those who can’t speak for themselves; plants, animals, humans, watersheds, and mountains. </p>
<ul><li><strong>The Dragon</strong></li></ul>
<p>The Dragon represents primordial, wild, unfettered nature in its most original sense.</p>
<ul><li><strong>The Knight</strong></li></ul>
<p>The Knight represents technology. In the beginning of the play, this technology is misused. Yet at its end, the Knight vows to protect the Red Lady, the earth and to forego his ways of thoughtless advancement</p>
<ul><li><strong>The Magistrate</strong></li></ul>
<p>The Magistrate represents fairness and balance</p>
<ul><li><strong>The Squire</strong></li></ul>
<p>A youth selected from the community to represent the future and hope of the land.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Supporting Characters</strong></li></ul>
<p>Vinotok’s Theatre Troupe is additionally full of 12 maidens, representing the 12 months of the year, female energy and the evolving seasons; 12 torchbearers as the male, protective energy for the town; 12 flagbearers as the markers of and holders of space; as well as a host of other Maidens, Lads, Mood Makers, Spirit Watchers, Forest Creatures, Fire Spinners, Drummers, Musicians and Dancers. </p>
<p>GREEN INITIATIVES</p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Zero Waste</strong> </li></ul>
<p>As a celebration of the environment it is our responsibility to reduce our trash as much as we possibly can. For this we have a constant aspirational goal of  zero waste from our festivities that we are always working towards. We have an enormous volunteer crew we call our Green Team. They organize our recycling, compost and trash. It is not a task to take lightly and is essential to our values. We perform a grand experiment in sustainability in our microcosm. We show visitors to our valley that conscious living is possible. If we can’t do it here, where can we?</p>
<ul><li><strong>Green Spirit Award</strong></li></ul>
<p>A local is honored for their contribution to the wellbeing of our natural world. This takes place at The Feast and they join us for the celebration as recognized environmental crusaders.</p>
<h2>The Impacts:</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Vinotok is a community event that works to cultivate a culture of respect for our planet and our people. Our performance fosters a devotion to understanding nature where we impart the principles of protecting and preserving, as we recognizing the fragile balance of nature at the Autumn Equinox. For our people we focus on community, balance, transformation, diversity and inclusion.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We create a space for the community to come together, feast and celebrate. Vinotok supports and promotes local and regional food producers by providing a platform for their organic labors to feed 350 people. With food grown as naturally and as locally as possible we break bread among new neighbors and old friends. Because of your donations we can ensure our farmers are paid upfront, our space guaranteed and our prices remain affordable. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Vinotok is an active response to current issues, needs, nuances, moods and challenges both local and global. Vinotok demonstrates to the world a possibility of balance in a future that considers nature when approaching growth. Through your contributions we can continue to strive towards our zero-waste goals for nearly 4,000 participants with more efficient systems and increased oversight.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We nurture grassroots, creative leadership within our community.We mentor each new generation, sharing our values of respect for nature and people, inclusion, diversity, transformation and balance.  We honor and foster individual creativity and vision by bringing in over 200 volunteer members of this community to offer their talents and experience. We have costume designers, sculpture builders, graphic artists, volunteer coordinators and culinary experts who all donate their time. With your donation we can free up funds raised from our events to recognize their hours of unpaid efforts with artists stipends and community acknowledgment.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Vinotok began over 34 years ago as an idea that has since generated ongoing seasonal celebrations throughout the valley. For nearly four decades we have fostered generations of Harvest Mothers and Babies. It has truly become a generational tradition. These additional funds will help our full-time community keep this our culture intact. Vinotok is a statement of who we are, what we hope to maintain, and who we constantly aspire to become.</p>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges:</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We are a seven-day ceremony with events each day or evening, and over thirty individual volunteer gatherings that come together to prepare for the celebrations. Maintaining our events faces increasing challenges each year.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Having previously entirely relied on event-based funding our celebration is dependent on many variables. If it snows on our feast less people attend and we lose crucial funding. If there is music the same night as Liar’s Night, we lose revenue. As our town grows, and our insurance costs rise, and our dependence on the support of local businesses becomes uncertain, we need donations to keep our authenticity. Every year our expenses grow as more and more regulations are placed on us to provide these events to our community.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Keeping costs of participation intentionally free or very low is vital to how we operate and integral to our values. We do not want this to become an exclusive event. We need your donations and participation to make certain this remains an event for the entire community.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Vinotok is planned each year by a volunteer council of thirty active full-time residents, making decisions through consensus to overcome hurdles, tighten up our operations, and improve our celebrations. Your donations allow us to cover the basic expenses it takes to put on the week of celebrations. This takes pressure off of our events and allows our volunteers a less stressful and more sustainable experience by not relying entirely on their output for income. Extra funds allow us to support them in financial ways as they strive to provide this grassroots experience for the community.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Your donations free up any income we make from our events to be used on unanticipated safety and permitting expenses which arise each year; improve our Zero Waste Initiative Plan; provide well-deserved Artist Honorariums for the creatives that concoct our costumes, sculptures, printed materials, and performances and more. These creatives have been generously donating their time and talent for decades of time and it’s time we are able to show them our appreciation.   </p>

<ul><li><strong>Go to dinner</strong></li></ul>
<p>           If you are not part of the mumming crew one of the best ways to experience it is to be in a restaurant on Elk Avenue from 5:00 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. on Saturday. The Vinotok Theatre Troupe perform the mumming play.  If you’re really feeling the spirit, offer the Troupe wine and bread from your table, as is the ancient tradition.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Wear a costume, make a head wreath, be in the streets</strong></li></ul>
<p>           Community members are encouraged to dress for any Vinotok event. Forest creatures and pan descendants also welcome. This is especially true for Liar’s Night, the Community Feast and Vinotok Day.  Make your own head wreath at the Vinotok Renaissance Booth at the Farmer's Market on Sunday (where there will also be a body art booth available), and at the Community Feast on Friday.  Grab a poet’s shirt, lace up your corset, make a jester’s hat.  </p>
<p>            On Vinotok Day as the mummers make their way through the restaurants, they will also be dancing in the streets. Dress up and meet them in the streets to dance to the live drums. While only the Vinotok Theatre Troupe will be mumming the restaurants, the streets should be full of community members dancing in costume.</p>

            There's way more to Vinotok than just the bonfire. Begin with the Celebration of the Harvest Mother; attend A “Myth, Meaning and Ritual” workshop;bring an offering for the Harvest Blessing & Mandala Creation, womenfolk join our Goddess’ Red Tent; listen to old-timer’s yarns around the pot-bellied stove of the museum; come get wild on Liar's Night.
Bring your music, poetry and stories
            If you write poetry, short stories, essays, rants, songs or compose spoken word, we invite you to share your creativity at the Community Feast on Friday night, around the fire.  We also invite musicians of all kinds to bring their instruments for community jam sessions.

Come eat together     
            The Community Feast is generously prepared by local talent. Feast on locally and regionally grown, organic food for economic prices. Enjoy, wine, spiced rum and hard apple cider at our cash bar. In order to accomplish our Zero Waste goal no eating tools are provided, help us by bringing your own and one to share.
Bring your Children
           Children are welcome at Vinotok activities. Celebration of the Harvest Mother at the Farmer's Market on Sunday, the creation of the Harvest Mandala on Tuesday, Storytelling on Wednesday at the Mountain Heritage Museum, the Community Feast on Friday, and Vinotok Day are all good kid opportunities.
Go to dinner
           If you are not part of the mumming crew one of the best ways to experience it is to be in a restaurant on Elk Avenue from 5:00 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. on Saturday. The Vinotok Theatre Troupe perform the mumming play.  If you’re really feeling the spirit, offer the Troupe wine and bread from your table, as is the ancient tradition.
Wear a costume, make a head wreath, be in the streets
           Community members are encouraged to dress for any Vinotok event. Forest creatures and pan descendants also welcome. This is especially true for Liar’s Night, the Community Feast and Vinotok Day.  Make your own head wreath at the Vinotok Renaissance Booth at the Farmer's Market on Sunday (where there will also be a body art booth available), and at the Community Feast on Friday.  Grab a poet’s shirt, lace up your corset, make a jester’s hat.  
            On Vinotok Day as the mummers make their way through the restaurants, they will also be dancing in the streets. Dress up and meet them in the streets to dance to the live drums. While only the Vinotok Theatre Troupe will be mumming the restaurants, the streets should be full of community members dancing in costume.
            Vinotok is for everyone. We’ll see you in the streets.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>Welcome to Music Broth: Scotland’s first musical instrument and equipment library</strong></h3>
<p>At Music Broth, we believe that everyone should have easy and equitable access to musical instruments and equipment. We support individuals, bands and organisations to pursue their musical ventures. This includes loaning out instruments, offering instrument repairs, creating workshops and supporting events.</p>
<p>After opening our library doors in Govanhill, Glasgow, in Sept 2018 we have had a growing number of instruments kindly donated and members joining. We have created this Hardship Fund to maintain and repair instruments and support music access for community members who otherwise couldn’t afford - through sponsored annual memberships to the library or funded places in music workshops.</p>
<p>We’d like your help to grow our Hardship Fund before Christmas, to ensure that in the New Year, we can make a quick start on repairing some of our instruments in need, getting them out to community members and creating music workshops.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our initial goal for our Hardship Fund is £3,500. Depending on donations, this could support:</p>
<ul>
<li>50 instrument repairs - care and restoration of our quality donated instruments</li>
<li>30 library memberships - annual access to any musical instruments in our library</li>
<li>25 workshop spaces - music and instrument education and repair workshops starting in the new year</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of our perks allow you to sponsor community participation with Music Broth – whether it’s for people you know or by paying-forward our services for others. Maybe your niece isn’t sure if she wants to learn the guitar or the violin - you could sponsor an annual library membership for her so she can try both. Or, perhaps you have no idea what to buy your musical pal for Christmas, as they’ve already hoarded enough instruments – you could sponsor a music workshop for a community group on their behalf (and, ask them kindly to donate any of their unused instruments to us!).</p>
<p>As well as knowing the impact of your chosen donation, you’ll receive a combination of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you email</li>
<li>Christmas Card with a custom Music Broth plectrum</li>
<li>Music Broth tote bag</li>
<li>Music Broth t-shirt</li>
<li>Invitation to our donors event<ul><li>This celebratory event will be held in February at the library, and will involve live music, food and drink, and a chance to tour our library and see the impact you've made</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our Music Broth Musical Instrument and Equipment Library is the first of it's kind in the UK. Library Founder and Co-Founder Felix Slavin and Jen O'Brien are musicians themselves and recognise the great benefit playing instruments and being involved in music can have on individual happiness, self-confidence and mental health. We strongly feel everybody should have the opportunity to at least try an instrument regardless of social or economic situation. We're also keen on preserving our planet's resources so keeping instruments and equipment in good use by many people is better than instruments gathering dust and new learners being put off by having to make new purchases.</p>
<p>The wonderful Glasgow community have already donated over 400 instruments to our fledgling library established in 2017. We want to make best use of these and get them out to as many library members as possible. We are already supporting lots of people with instruments they otherwise would be unable to access, through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Partnerships with local organisations; such as Youth Community Support Agency where we are helping a group of 10 young asylum seekers to take instruments home with them while they take part in music workshops and Girls Rock Glasgow Summer Rock School which has 40 young people learning instruments and forming bands.</li>
<li>Helping parents and carers access instruments for their children in an affordable way - and if they drop guitar after 2 months they can always try ukulele or trombone instead! ;-)</li>
<li>Bands in the music scene - helping to make gigs happen through providing backline and transportation, and showcasing exciting new music.</li>
<li>Supporting music tutors to make lessons more accessible and more effective through our library of instruments being available to learners both during the workshops and to take home; such as Wevolution guitar and ukulele lessons in Glasgow's east end.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your contribution will help us do more of this great work and help us reach more people.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>In the event that we achieve less than our target the funds raised will still be used to repair instruments, support library memberships and workshops places - just fewer than we'd hoped!</p>
<p>We're an entirely voluntary run social enterprise so we'll continue to dedicate our time to sustaining and growing our library, and seek further support through fundraising and paid for services. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>New Music Broth advocates and volunteers are always welcome:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spread the word - we want to be the loudest library in Scotland so give us a shout out through the social media links below!</li>
<li>Contact us if you have time, expertise or musical instruments or equipment to share</li>

But a quick study of the invalidated signatures plainly shows that the state,

<br/><br/><br/></div>","On June 3, 2014, Edward Forchion filed his petition to be
included on the General Election ballot in November 2014.
____________________________________________________________
June 9th: The NJ Democratic State Committee challenged my petition by fax—late and out of time.
Nevertheless the Administrative Office of the Courts held a challenge hearing.
On June 10th-11th: the Administrative Office of the Courts held a 15-hour
challenge hearing. The AOC’s Judge Bingham officially ruled that I was 3 short
of the required 100 signatures—after I had originally submitted more than 200.
But a quick study of the invalidated signatures plainly shows that the state,
at the behest of the Democrats/Republicans, has invalidated numerous citizens
in error or on purpose. Many of the citizens whose signatures have been
invalidated were disenfranchised—they are in fact valid registered voters!
I AM A VALID CANDIDATE: REMOVING ME FROM
THE BALLOT IS CORRUPT
On June 11th I immediately VOWED TO FIGHT THE DEMOCRATS and FILED AN APPEAL TO THE NJ APPELLATE COURT on June 18th. I
motioned the courts:
(1) to
proceed in an emergent matter
(2) to
proceed without costly transcripts
On July 21st the NJ appeals court ruled NO: DENIAL OF
MOTION TO PROCEED WITHOUT TRANSCRIPTS. — So I must pay for the transcripts
in order to pursue Ballot Access. The cost of transcripts for a 15-hour-long
session is estimated at $5,000. But the court has ignored the emergent motion!

OUT-PRICING AVERAGE CITIZENS
This is a technique that lawyers, government
bureaucrats, and authoritarian types consistently employ to keep poor citizens
from accessing the courts: They out-price them—they keep the costs
prohibitively high so as to avoid arguing the merits of the actual content
within the context of a legal argument.
I ask you—“WE THE PEOPLE”—and specifically the
CANNABIS CONSUMING COMMUNITY of AMERICA to help me with this fight for ballot access.
Democracy is democracy for all, not just
Democrats and Republicans with money to burn. No matter what your viewpoint on
cannabis in general and me in particular, this is a fight for fair ballot
access, and it’s something every American citizen should be able to relate to.
Slowly but surely the freedoms that underpin our democracy are being eroded.
Let’s show them that we won’t take it lying down—that the populace is paying
attention and will not tolerate the elitist exclusionary red-tape tactics of
those who seek to maintain their monopoly on governance so as to suppress us
“plebeians,” so that real change need never occur.

<h2>LA CHISPA</h2>
<p>In September 2014 I was on a train leaving central London. I'd just been blown away by a live storytelling event in a huge old chapel in Islington and I was flying home to Madrid the next day. I remember wondering how I could share what I'd experienced with all of my friends and loved ones in Spain? It would be a problem as some only spoke Spanish, and others only spoke English.</p>
<p>By the time the train reached the outskirts of the city, the main concept of La Chispa had been created. An event for true stories told live, but with two in English and two in Spanish. </p>
<p>In the first year it took place in the cosy Café Atilier, hosting to small groups of people through the year, but things were still very informal. </p>
<p>In spring 2016, Nanor joined the team and that's when version 2.0 began. We moved into bars, theatres and gardens to present stories to ever-growing audiences and we started to create free audio content from those events. </p>
<p>We have been delivering something unique; live entertainment where we share languages and learn through the real experiences of others - help us create even more!</p>
<p>--</p>
<p><i>La Chispa es uno de lo más originales eventos creados en Madrid, ya que se trata de una experiencia única en el arte de narrar en dos idiomas. La Chispa busca y presenta las mejores 4 historias reales, 2 en inglés y 2 en español, que se cuentan en vivo, y sin apuntes.</i></p>
<p><i>La Chispa no es poesía, ni teatro ni monólogo, sino historias reales de nuestros ‘madrileños’, nativos o no. Estamos intentando promover la diversidad de nuestras experiencias y conectar con la comunidad a través de este arte de narrar.</i></p>
<p><i>La Chispa fue creado por Natasha Yaworsky en 2014 y empezó de nuevo al unirse Nanor Rose Demirjian en 2016 con una energía y diseño nuevo y para traer historias reales a un público más amplio y a varios lugares de Madrid.</i></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>CAMPAIGN</h3>
<p>We want to bring La Chispa Storytelling to wider audiences and become a high quality resource for language learning and bilingual entertainment. </p>

<p> </p>
<p><u>*If we don't reach our entire goal, funds will go to audio recording equipment and to cover the costs of video production.</u></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>THE IMPACT</h3>
<p>The world is becoming more and more bilingual and multicultural. This projects allows us to bring storytelling to the scene in Madrid in a truly bilingual way; we believe the social impact on sharing our cultures and language will be hugely positive. This campaign helps us continue to grow, carry out even better and more frequent events, and bring FREE podcasts to people all around the world, in two languages.</p>
<p>We have shown that we are up to the challenge, since 2014 we have been working on La Chispa alongside our full-time jobs taking it from a small audience of 15-25 to theatres and bars attracting audiences of 65-80! We have invested a considerable amount of our own time, and without outside help, and it's because we can see that La Chispa is growing. This shows us that there is a real interest, and maybe a need, for bilingual entertainment.</p>

La Chispa es uno de lo más originales eventos creados en Madrid, ya que se trata de una experiencia única en el arte de narrar en dos idiomas. La Chispa busca y presenta las mejores 4 historias reales, 2 en inglés y 2 en español, que se cuentan en vivo, y sin apuntes.
La Chispa no es poesía, ni teatro ni monólogo, sino historias reales de nuestros ‘madrileños’, nativos o no. Estamos intentando promover la diversidad de nuestras experiencias y conectar con la comunidad a través de este arte de narrar.
La Chispa fue creado por Natasha Yaworsky en 2014 y empezó de nuevo al unirse Nanor Rose Demirjian en 2016 con una energía y diseño nuevo y para traer historias reales a un público más amplio y a varios lugares de Madrid.
 
CAMPAIGN
We want to bring La Chispa Storytelling to wider audiences and become a high quality resource for language learning and bilingual entertainment. 
This campaign is to fund our audio equipment, our event production costs and website maintenance. We can see that as La Chispa continues to grow, we need to be constantly improving and raising the quality of what we provide.

Audio and Recording Equipment (recorder, ID3 editor, SD card, cable): 315€
Website maintenance yearly fee: 286€
Improved event experience (photographer, banner, two way radio): 410€

500€   2 free tickets, VIP seating, 2 drinks at one show in 2018 and free La Chispa tote bag with stickers inside

 
*If we don't reach our entire goal, funds will go to audio recording equipment and to cover the costs of video production.
 

THE IMPACT
The world is becoming more and more bilingual and multicultural. This projects allows us to bring storytelling to the scene in Madrid in a truly bilingual way; we believe the social impact on sharing our cultures and language will be hugely positive. This campaign helps us continue to grow, carry out even better and more frequent events, and bring FREE podcasts to people all around the world, in two languages.
We have shown that we are up to the challenge, since 2014 we have been working on La Chispa alongside our full-time jobs taking it from a small audience of 15-25 to theatres and bars attracting audiences of 65-80! We have invested a considerable amount of our own time, and without outside help, and it's because we can see that La Chispa is growing. This shows us that there is a real interest, and maybe a need, for bilingual entertainment.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What We're Building</h2>
<p><strong>We've spent over a year</strong> working on ePluribus to deeply understand how representatives process and understand constituent messages and how we can help them do it better. We're now extremely well equipped to do so.</p>
<p>ePluribus has four main components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>social media integration</strong></li>
<li><strong>embeddable widget</strong></li>
<li><strong>website</strong></li>
<li><strong>data dashboard</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The following sections detail these components.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Social Media Integration</h3>
<p>People routinely talk about politics on Facebook and Twitter, but it doesn't make much difference because <b>social media is a bubble</b>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502828988/zpihapuo2bbirqbgdrkv.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our <strong>social media integration</strong> helps you <strong>break that bubble!</strong> It lets you post on Facebook or tweet on Twitter and <i>simultaneously </i>send an official message to your representatives. It lets you tell your friends <i>and </i>your representatives what you think about political issues at the same time. You simply choose a representative from a dropdown menu, and ePluribus takes the text of your post or tweet and sends it as an official message to that representative. Check out the animation below to see how it works.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohhwfXw9AYGpn4rok/giphy.gif"" src="""" style=""width:100%;""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Facebook</i></p>
<p><strong>This is a huge deal. </strong>Social media today is the ultimate echo chamber. Stuck in our own bubbles, what we say goes only to our friends and has little impact on the outside world. <strong>ePluribus breaks the bubble so that you can be heard</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Embeddable Widget</strong></h3>
<p>The <strong>embeddable widget</strong> is a web form that any website can use to let its users send messages to their representatives. Representatives themselves can use the widget, as can news publications, blogs, government agencies, and many others. Check out the animations below for an example of how this could be used on Speaker of the House Paul Ryan's website. Notice how much easier it is to use than his current contact form!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/T5iZ1vo5Rg8hi/giphy.gif"" src="""" style=""width:100%;""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Embeddable Widget</i></p>
<p><strong>This is game-changing technology. </strong>When representatives embed the ePluribus widget, you'll be able to talk to them directly and finally have <i>real impact</i>. Other websites can also embed the widget so that you can write to your representatives anytime, anywhere. Imagine reading about the latest healthcare debate in the <i>New York Times </i>or the <i>Wall Street Journal </i>and being able to send an official message to lawmakers from the same page. ePluribus will make it <strong>easier and more impactful than ever before</strong> to talk to your government. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Website</h3>
<p>The <strong>website </strong>will allow you to send messages to multiple representatives at the same time. It will also let you see the messages you've sent, control which personal data is attached to your messages, and change your account settings. The website will be mobile-friendly and accessible on any device -- whether a desktop computer in a public library or the latest iteration of the iPhone.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502545969/t3d5mrtneukn7cmkykap.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Mobile-Friendly Website</i></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Data Dashboard</h3>
<p>The <strong>data dashboard </strong>is what representatives and their staff will be able to access. They'll get messages on one side and aggregate data about those messages and the people who sent them on the other side. Because ePluribus ensures unique identity and verifies personal information (see the sections below), representatives will know with certainty <i>for the first time ever</i> who's contacting them and what they're saying.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502546049/afkuxacqltcxunuuxxaf.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Data Dashboard</i></p>
<p>These four components (the social media integration, embeddable widget, website, and dashboard) make ePluribus <strong>the world's first</strong> <b>civic network.</b></p>
<ul></ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""#"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502834341/s0yoyhmuemjy7dhe9rui.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Campaign Goals</h2>
<p>We need at least $10,000 to make ePluribus a reality. <strong>We're putting in $10,000 of our own money</strong>, not to mention the past year of hard work, so we're very much personally invested in ePluribus. </p>
<p>We're running this campaign to accomplish two crucial goals:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>raise as much funding as possible</strong></li>
<li><strong>reach as many people as possible</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We've made it this far with grant funding we won through competitions and our own money, but now <strong>we need your help! </strong>The more funding we raise, the better ePluribus will be. The more people we reach, the more impact it will have.</p>
<p>Our campaign goal is <strong>$10,000</strong>. That funding will supplement the money we've already raised and will go partly toward development and partly toward marketing and service costs. We anticipate the spending breakdown to be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$5,000: </strong>additional development of social media integration, optimization of virality, Safari extension (in addition to Chrome)</li>
<li>
<b>$3,500: </b>marketing of social media integration and embeddable widget, Facebook and Twitter ads</li>
<li>
<b>$1,500:</b> embeddable widget service costs (for major publishers), data dashboard service costs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We hope to raise far more than $10,000</strong> if at all possible because we can do so much more if we have more resources. Here are a few of our stretch goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>with $20,000 total: </strong>dedicated salesperson, deals with online media and representatives, validation of business model, additional online marketing</li>
<li>
<strong>with $50,000 total: </strong>dedicated part-time developer for all technical needs and product iteration, furthering of development timeline as described below, additional online and analog marketing</li>
<li>
<strong>with $100,000 total: </strong>dedicated full-time developer to prepare for large user base and iterate product along development timeline below, significant additional marketing</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505221120/vudmpp3w7zzsgkeiveil.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""#"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502834341/s0yoyhmuemjy7dhe9rui.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Problem</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505222525/c87j1f98qylvmxgdrmsn.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The real<i> </i>problem we're addressing may not be obvious. It's that <i>representatives can't process, let alone understand, the enormous number of messages they receive</i>. Because of this, <strong>the solution is not to send <i>more </i>messages but rather to send <i>better </i>messages</strong>: ones that representatives can process and understand.</p>
<p>One of the hardest things about civic tech is remembering what the problem <i>isn't<i>. </i></i>Here's a list:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>It's not that we need better access to information. </strong>Anyone who wants to read a bill, see information about their representatives, or learn about how government works can do so very easily with the help of a huge number of resources. Even the most obsessed political junkie would never run out of information.</li>
<li>
<strong>It's not that <i>sending </i>messages to representatives is hard.</strong> <i>Sending messages</i> is easy; <i>being heard</i> is hard. It isn't very difficult to fill out a contact form, make a phone call, or even send a letter or fax. The problem is that none of these traditional channels give you any <i>impact<i>. </i></i>
</li>
<li>
<strong>It's not that people don't care about politics. </strong>People talk about politics, protest, and petition all the time. Sure, some people are apathetic, but there have always been a huge number of people who care deeply about politics, and there always will be. Particularly following the most recent election cycle, more and more people are engaging with the political system.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502830381/tt55ohx0osbvdnvkkcum.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Like most people working on civic technology, we cycled through these problems-that-aren't-really-problems until we learned better. Through our research, we identified what the problem <i>truly</i> is: it's that <strong>civic communication lacks unique identity</strong>, which is <i>why</i> <strong>you have no impact</strong>. When you send a message to your representative, they don't even know for sure if you're their constituent or if you're a unique person. They know nothing about you and can't process your message is a meaningful way. Meanwhile, advocacy groups flood representatives with thousands of messages. No wonder contacting representatives doesn't work: <strong>your voice is drowned out in the crowd.</strong></p>
<p>We're building ePluribus to make <strong>unique identity the new standard for civic communication</strong>. You'll complete a simple, easy, one-time registration process to verify that you're a person (not a bot), a <i>unique<i> </i></i>person with one account, and that you're the person you say you are. It's no different than signing up for a bank account. You expect your bank to make sure you're actually <i>you</i>, and with ePluribus you can expect the same from your representatives.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""#"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502834341/s0yoyhmuemjy7dhe9rui.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
</div><div>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Why Is This New?</h2>
<p>Our emphasis on unique identity is <strong>completely new</strong>. Everyone else is building bigger loudspeakers, but <strong>volume is the problem not the solution</strong>. We're not building any kind of loudspeaker. We're building a direct line to your representatives so that <strong>you won't have to shout to be heard</strong>.</p>
<p>Civic technology has for the past couple decades focused mainly on two areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>making it very easy for people to contact representatives in traditional ways (all of which lack unique identity)</li>
<li>giving lobbyists and special interests high tech tools that make it worse for the average American, not better</li>
</ol>
<p>Both of these make civic communication worse, not better. The first one ironically makes it even harder to be heard: the number of messages representatives receive has increased at least 10x, but the technology to process and understand those messages has hardly improved. The second only helps big money get bigger: most Americans are completely left out of the loop.</p>
<p>Strangely, <strong>advocacy groups are a big part of the problem</strong>. Let's say you run an advocacy group, and you run an online petition campaign to show support. If you get 25,000 clicks on your petition, you don't care if those clicks came from 25,000 unique people or just 1,000. Even if you know they came from only 1,000 people, you certainly won't tell anyone else! It looks like you have more support than you actually do, and that helps your cause.</p>
<p><strong>This is an extremely problematic incentive</strong>: it makes it impossible for representatives to know where support really lies. What are they supposed to make of online petitions and mass mailings? How are they supposed to hear real people with real concerns who send them individual messages? They can't because those messages are buried in the avalanche of communications advocacy groups are sending them every hour of every day. No wonder we don't like what our representatives represent: <strong>they're not representing us!</strong></p>
<p>Unique identity is the clear solution to this problem. With the help of ePluribus, representatives will know that the people contacting them are real people with only one account. They'll finally be able to listen to you and tune out the noise, and <strong>you'll finally be heard</strong>. Advocacy will be <i>meaningful </i>again.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Why Us?</h2>
<p>Civic technology is hard to do well. To build the product, you need to work with people in technology who generally know nothing about politics. To make the product matter, you need to work with people in politics who generally know nothing about technology. And to get the product used, you need to work with people all over the country who often don't know much about either.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502832247/jdlnlhst6dl5qhay7awj.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>There aren't many people with the right skills, backgrounds, and professional networks to create such a product successfully. But <strong>we're just those people</strong>. As students at Stanford, we live in the heart of Silicon Valley, the epicenter of technology. We spent much of this summer in Washington, DC and built a network of over 250 people across politics, media, activist organizations, and many other areas. And because we grew up in suburban Wisconsin, we know lots of (and are ourselves) middle-of-the-country Americans who will ultimately use ePluribus to talk to their government. </p>
<p><strong>We're also not new to crowdfunding.</strong> Liam successfully raised the money he needed to publish his book <i>Data and Power</i>, which we mentioned above. You can check out that campaign <a href=""https://igg.me/at/data-and-power/x/8573246"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Why Now?</h2>
<p>No matter your political affiliation or beliefs, <strong>American politics is a mess right now</strong>. Partisanship has crippled Congress for almost a decade, and <strong>we the people aren't being heard</strong>. People all over the country are struggling with stagnant wages and outdated infrastructure. Most of us feel like there's no point trying to tell our representatives what to change, and those who still try to are just drowned out by louder voices backed by bigger checks. <strong>Better technology won't cure every problem, but it sure is a good place to start.</strong></p>
<p>We've spoken to a huge number of people about the state of American politics, and what we hear over and over is <i>frustration</i>. Everyone knows things aren't the way they should be, but <strong>people don't know where to turn</strong>. They don't know what could possibly move the needle because their government seems stuck in the mud. We think it is, too, and we're building ePluribus to make it a little less stuck.</p>
<p><strong>The time is now</strong> to make a better tool. Talking to your representatives shouldn't be so hard. You shouldn't have to navigate government websites that look like they were built 25 years ago. You shouldn't have to rely on mass mailings and online petitions to get your voice across because those methods don't work. <strong>The technology exists to fix this problem, and the passion does too.</strong> So let's do it, together. Let's make the system work better, for everyone.</p>

(1) Nonprofits depend on donations from wealthy individuals and organizations, which inevitably have partisan political ties. We're extremely intent on staying completely <i>nonpartisan</i>, so we don't want to be beholden to partisan interests. (2) Nonprofits spend an enormous amount of their time and resources raising money. For-profits can grow much more quickly, and growth is how we'll have a big impact. (3) Based on current legal statutes, it's possible that ePluribus would be considered a ""lobbying organization"" under the law because it stores political data (though of course we're not in the business of lobbying!). If that were to happen, ePluribus would be legally required to be a for-profit. To avoid breaking any laws, we've decided to be a for-profit upfront.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>How does ePluribus make money?</strong></p><p>The ePluribus platform is completely free for people to use. We will also make the embeddable widget and data dashboard free for representatives if at all possible, since our mission is to improve the political system. ePluribus makes money by selling aggregate, non-personally identifiable data and analytics to interested organizations, like media and academic institutions. Privacy is of the utmost importance to us, and we can assure you that all personal data will be completely safe on ePluribus. (If you're not convinced that we care deeply about this, note that Liam wrote a whole <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Data-Power-Corporate-Control-America/dp/0692391142"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>book</i></a> on issues of data and privacy.)</p><p><strong>How are you building the product?</strong></p><p>Liam designed and built everything you see in this campaign, including the logo, social media integration design, widget design, website prototype, and data dashboard prototype.

Why ""ePluribus""?
""ePluribus"" is a play on the ""e-"" commonly used to abbreviate ""electronic,"" as in e-Mail or e-Commerce. ""ePluribus"" is also inspired by the unofficial motto of the United States ""e pluribus unum"", which is Latin for ""out of many, one"". You may not realize it, but this motto is all around you! Take out a one dollar bill and look at the back side.

""E PLURIBUS UNUM""
 
In Brief



We're brothers and students at Stanford University building an online platform to help you be heard.
We're working with a team of world-class developers and advisors to equip democracy with 21st-century tools.
ePluribus lets you turn tweets and Facebook posts into official messages to your representatives. It also provides a contact form that any website can embed to let its users talk to their representatives.
ePluribus users complete a one-time registration process that verifies their identity. This ensures that unique identity will be the new standard for civic communication, which is crucial for helping real people like you be heard.
We give representatives aggregate, non-personally identifiable data to help them process your messages. We also give some of the data to media so that they can hold your representatives accountable.

We need your help! We're raising money to make ePluribus a reality and would so appreciate your help. We'd also love it if you'd help spread the word!




What We're Building
We've spent over a year working on ePluribus to deeply understand how representatives process and understand constituent messages and how we can help them do it better. We're now extremely well equipped to do so.
ePluribus has four main components:

social media integration
embeddable widget
website
data dashboard

The following sections detail these components.
 
Social Media Integration
People routinely talk about politics on Facebook and Twitter, but it doesn't make much difference because social media is a bubble.

Our social media integration helps you break that bubble! It lets you post on Facebook or tweet on Twitter and simultaneously send an official message to your representatives. It lets you tell your friends and your representatives what you think about political issues at the same time. You simply choose a representative from a dropdown menu, and ePluribus takes the text of your post or tweet and sends it as an official message to that representative. Check out the animation below to see how it works.

This is a huge deal. Social media today is the ultimate echo chamber. Stuck in our own bubbles, what we say goes only to our friends and has little impact on the outside world. ePluribus breaks the bubble so that you can be heard.
 
Embeddable Widget
The embeddable widget is a web form that any website can use to let its users send messages to their representatives. Representatives themselves can use the widget, as can news publications, blogs, government agencies, and many others. Check out the animations below for an example of how this could be used on Speaker of the House Paul Ryan's website. Notice how much easier it is to use than his current contact form!

Embeddable Widget
This is game-changing technology. When representatives embed the ePluribus widget, you'll be able to talk to them directly and finally have real impact. Other websites can also embed the widget so that you can write to your representatives anytime, anywhere. Imagine reading about the latest healthcare debate in the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal and being able to send an official message to lawmakers from the same page. ePluribus will make it easier and more impactful than ever before to talk to your government. 
 
Website
The website will allow you to send messages to multiple representatives at the same time. It will also let you see the messages you've sent, control which personal data is attached to your messages, and change your account settings. The website will be mobile-friendly and accessible on any device -- whether a desktop computer in a public library or the latest iteration of the iPhone.

Mobile-Friendly Website
 
Data Dashboard
The data dashboard is what representatives and their staff will be able to access. They'll get messages on one side and aggregate data about those messages and the people who sent them on the other side. Because ePluribus ensures unique identity and verifies personal information (see the sections below), representatives will know with certainty for the first time ever who's contacting them and what they're saying.

Data Dashboard
These four components (the social media integration, embeddable widget, website, and dashboard) make ePluribus the world's first civic network.


 
Campaign Goals
We need at least $10,000 to make ePluribus a reality. We're putting in $10,000 of our own money, not to mention the past year of hard work, so we're very much personally invested in ePluribus. 
We're running this campaign to accomplish two crucial goals:

raise as much funding as possible
reach as many people as possible

We've made it this far with grant funding we won through competitions and our own money, but now we need your help! The more funding we raise, the better ePluribus will be. The more people we reach, the more impact it will have.
Our campaign goal is $10,000. That funding will supplement the money we've already raised and will go partly toward development and partly toward marketing and service costs. We anticipate the spending breakdown to be as follows:


$5,000: additional development of social media integration, optimization of virality, Safari extension (in addition to Chrome)

$3,500: marketing of social media integration and embeddable widget, Facebook and Twitter ads

$1,500: embeddable widget service costs (for major publishers), data dashboard service costs

We hope to raise far more than $10,000 if at all possible because we can do so much more if we have more resources. Here are a few of our stretch goals:


with $20,000 total: dedicated salesperson, deals with online media and representatives, validation of business model, additional online marketing

with $50,000 total: dedicated part-time developer for all technical needs and product iteration, furthering of development timeline as described below, additional online and analog marketing

with $100,000 total: dedicated full-time developer to prepare for large user base and iterate product along development timeline below, significant additional marketing

Problem

The real problem we're addressing may not be obvious. It's that representatives can't process, let alone understand, the enormous number of messages they receive. Because of this, the solution is not to send more messages but rather to send better messages: ones that representatives can process and understand.
One of the hardest things about civic tech is remembering what the problem isn't. Here's a list:


It's not that we need better access to information. Anyone who wants to read a bill, see information about their representatives, or learn about how government works can do so very easily with the help of a huge number of resources. Even the most obsessed political junkie would never run out of information.

It's not that sending messages to representatives is hard. Sending messages is easy; being heard is hard. It isn't very difficult to fill out a contact form, make a phone call, or even send a letter or fax. The problem is that none of these traditional channels give you any impact. 


It's not that people don't care about politics. People talk about politics, protest, and petition all the time. Sure, some people are apathetic, but there have always been a huge number of people who care deeply about politics, and there always will be. Particularly following the most recent election cycle, more and more people are engaging with the political system.


Like most people working on civic technology, we cycled through these problems-that-aren't-really-problems until we learned better. Through our research, we identified what the problem truly is: it's that civic communication lacks unique identity, which is why you have no impact. When you send a message to your representative, they don't even know for sure if you're their constituent or if you're a unique person. They know nothing about you and can't process your message is a meaningful way. Meanwhile, advocacy groups flood representatives with thousands of messages. No wonder contacting representatives doesn't work: your voice is drowned out in the crowd.
We're building ePluribus to make unique identity the new standard for civic communication. You'll complete a simple, easy, one-time registration process to verify that you're a person (not a bot), a unique person with one account, and that you're the person you say you are. It's no different than signing up for a bank account. You expect your bank to make sure you're actually you, and with ePluribus you can expect the same from your representatives.


Why Is This New?
Our emphasis on unique identity is completely new. Everyone else is building bigger loudspeakers, but volume is the problem not the solution. We're not building any kind of loudspeaker. We're building a direct line to your representatives so that you won't have to shout to be heard.
Civic technology has for the past couple decades focused mainly on two areas:

making it very easy for people to contact representatives in traditional ways (all of which lack unique identity)
giving lobbyists and special interests high tech tools that make it worse for the average American, not better

Both of these make civic communication worse, not better. The first one ironically makes it even harder to be heard: the number of messages representatives receive has increased at least 10x, but the technology to process and understand those messages has hardly improved. The second only helps big money get bigger: most Americans are completely left out of the loop.
Strangely, advocacy groups are a big part of the problem. Let's say you run an advocacy group, and you run an online petition campaign to show support. If you get 25,000 clicks on your petition, you don't care if those clicks came from 25,000 unique people or just 1,000. Even if you know they came from only 1,000 people, you certainly won't tell anyone else! It looks like you have more support than you actually do, and that helps your cause.
This is an extremely problematic incentive: it makes it impossible for representatives to know where support really lies. What are they supposed to make of online petitions and mass mailings? How are they supposed to hear real people with real concerns who send them individual messages? They can't because those messages are buried in the avalanche of communications advocacy groups are sending them every hour of every day. No wonder we don't like what our representatives represent: they're not representing us!
Unique identity is the clear solution to this problem. With the help of ePluribus, representatives will know that the people contacting them are real people with only one account. They'll finally be able to listen to you and tune out the noise, and you'll finally be heard. Advocacy will be meaningful again.
 
Why Us?
Civic technology is hard to do well. To build the product, you need to work with people in technology who generally know nothing about politics. To make the product matter, you need to work with people in politics who generally know nothing about technology. And to get the product used, you need to work with people all over the country who often don't know much about either.

There aren't many people with the right skills, backgrounds, and professional networks to create such a product successfully. But we're just those people. As students at Stanford, we live in the heart of Silicon Valley, the epicenter of technology. We spent much of this summer in Washington, DC and built a network of over 250 people across politics, media, activist organizations, and many other areas. And because we grew up in suburban Wisconsin, we know lots of (and are ourselves) middle-of-the-country Americans who will ultimately use ePluribus to talk to their government. 
We're also not new to crowdfunding. Liam successfully raised the money he needed to publish his book Data and Power, which we mentioned above. You can check out that campaign here.

Why Now?
No matter your political affiliation or beliefs, American politics is a mess right now. Partisanship has crippled Congress for almost a decade, and we the people aren't being heard. People all over the country are struggling with stagnant wages and outdated infrastructure. Most of us feel like there's no point trying to tell our representatives what to change, and those who still try to are just drowned out by louder voices backed by bigger checks. Better technology won't cure every problem, but it sure is a good place to start.
We've spoken to a huge number of people about the state of American politics, and what we hear over and over is frustration. Everyone knows things aren't the way they should be, but people don't know where to turn. They don't know what could possibly move the needle because their government seems stuck in the mud. We think it is, too, and we're building ePluribus to make it a little less stuck.
The time is now to make a better tool. Talking to your representatives shouldn't be so hard. You shouldn't have to navigate government websites that look like they were built 25 years ago. You shouldn't have to rely on mass mailings and online petitions to get your voice across because those methods don't work. The technology exists to fix this problem, and the passion does too. So let's do it, together. Let's make the system work better, for everyone.

 FAQCan I invest in ePluribus?Yes, we are open to equity investment. We're happy to discuss terms with interested angel investors and venture capital firms. Please reach out to us (contact@epluribus.io) if you'd like to know more.Can I join your Advisory Board?We're always on the lookout for new advisors who can help us navigate the technological and political landscape. If you'd like to join, please reach out to us (contact@epluribus.io) for more information. We offer standard stock options for advisors.Is ePluribus for-profit or nonprofit?ePluribus is mission-based for-profit organization, for three reasons. (1) Nonprofits depend on donations from wealthy individuals and organizations, which inevitably have partisan political ties. We're extremely intent on staying completely nonpartisan, so we don't want to be beholden to partisan interests. (2) Nonprofits spend an enormous amount of their time and resources raising money. For-profits can grow much more quickly, and growth is how we'll have a big impact. (3) Based on current legal statutes, it's possible that ePluribus would be considered a ""lobbying organization"" under the law because it stores political data (though of course we're not in the business of lobbying!). If that were to happen, ePluribus would be legally required to be a for-profit. To avoid breaking any laws, we've decided to be a for-profit upfront. How does ePluribus make money?The ePluribus platform is completely free for people to use. We will also make the embeddable widget and data dashboard free for representatives if at all possible, since our mission is to improve the political system. ePluribus makes money by selling aggregate, non-personally identifiable data and analytics to interested organizations, like media and academic institutions. Privacy is of the utmost importance to us, and we can assure you that all personal data will be completely safe on ePluribus. (If you're not convinced that we care deeply about this, note that Liam wrote a whole book on issues of data and privacy.)How are you building the product?Liam designed and built everything you see in this campaign, including the logo, social media integration design, widget design, website prototype, and data dashboard prototype. However, we're now working with a team of freelance designers and developers that we met through the Stanford Graduate School of Business. With their decades of experience at top tech companies, they're doing fantastic work to bring ePluribus to life.Are you staying in school while you work on ePluribus?Yes. We will remain students at Stanford, but Liam is a rising senior and will take the lead on ePluribus immediately following his graduation in June 2018. Aidan is a rising junior and will join immediately following his graduation in June 2019.",34.0,2,"2 Campaigns

<h2>This Year’s Goal: Cover the Fest!</h2>
<p>Help take our Not-For-Profit Society a step closer to self sustainability!</p>
<p>An important step in becoming more sustainable is reducing our yearly rental overhead. This year's crowdfunding cause is focused on just that, specifically purchasing our own tents! </p>
<p>In four short years, Bear Creek Folk Festival has quickly become a treasure of the Arts and Culture landscape of Grande Prairie. Proudly presenting world-class lineups every year, including artists such as Feist, Blue Rodeo, case/lang/veirs (Neko Case, k.d. lang, and Laura Veirs), Bruce Cockburn, Alan Doyle, Corb Lund, City and Colour, Colin James, Michael Franti and Spearhead, and many more, and drawing crowds of thousands from all around Western Canada and beyond, it is exciting to think of the legacy event that this festival is poised to become. Additionally, we are working to become more sustainable and cut down on our yearly overhead. To this end, we are raising funds to help “Cover the Fest!” and purchase our own tents to cut down on the thousands of dollars in annual rental costs for our current tent needs.</p>
<p>The tents we want to purchase are the beautiful, high-peaked, white, wind-resistant tents that you have grown used to seeing on our site every year. Over time, we aim to own all of our own tents site-wide. This would make a big difference to our annual financial stability. We are excited to finally take the first step towards this important goal through this funding campaign!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601274086/ukxaefllbwczhwralmxg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Be part of history in the making and help us to not only make 2021 a year to remember, but also build the foundation to become stronger and more sustainable! Twenty years from now, when this festival has become an important mainstay in Alberta's rich cultural landscape, you can proudly say that you helped to make it happen!</p>
<h2>The Event</h2>
<p>The 2021 Bear Creek Folk Fest will take place August 13-15 on a picturesque hill in Muskoseepi Park, in Grande Prairie. The festival features over 30 artists from around the world, performing in multiple workshops and concerts, on four stages over three days. The music ranges from traditional folk to blues, country, Celtic, rock, and many points in between, and features a great combination of world-famous headliners, emerging artists, and undiscovered gems.</p>
<p>First and foremost, this is an inclusive and family-friendly event. Children under 12 and seniors 80 and over are free. This year will mark a special expansion of our very popular kids area with the launch of our “Kids Zone Fest within a Fest” and the addition of children’s performers and other programming. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601296854/zafsvqkc0n100pknvitw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The site also features an artisan crafts area, food vendors from around Western Canada, and a beer garden with sight lines to the  main stage.</p>
<p>Many will attest that this is a magical weekend. Everywhere you turn, you see friendly volunteers, families gathering, old friends reuniting, and new friendships being formed. It is truly the gathering and creation of a community.</p>
<p>This year marks new challenges and uncertainties as we all work to overcome the COVID pandemic. We are committed to continuing to be a safe and friendly environment for all festival participants and are taking major steps to ensure that we are prepared to present a fantastic event in 2021. It will be both a celebration of world-class family entertainment worthy of our Fifth Anniversary and an event that is safe and accessible to all, one that will adhere to any and all public health guidelines that may exist at the time of our event.</p>
<p>This has been a difficult time for people around the world. We look forward to playing an integral role in drawing our community back together and breathing new life into our local economy, local tourism, and civic morale. </p>
<h2>The Goal</h2>
<p>The first $7,000 of our goal will buy us the tents needed for our newly expanded Kids Zone. Funds we raise beyond that would cover the cost of our Snack Shack tent, Beer Garden shade tent and volunteer shade tents. Though we have set a fundraising goal of $15,000, the more tents we are able to buy through this campaign, the more secure and sustainable the fest will become!  </p>
<p>To show our gratitude, we are offering tokens of appreciation for each funding level. These are special promotions that will not be available beyond this campaign. For the first time ever, we are also offering the opportunity to purchase and dedicate a particular tent and have your own legacy that lives on our site. More than anything, years from now, you can be proud that you were one of the people that supported this great event and helped to create a legacy.</p>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>If you are not in a position to give financially, you can still help! For anyone who is a fan of the festival or excited to give it a try, please spread the word about this campaign and encourage those who can participate to do so. Even the smallest of contributions can add up to make a huge difference!</p>

The <strong>British Museum of Food </strong>is announcing a crowdfunding page to bring the first major exhibition that explores the history and sensory pleasure of the nation’s favourite summertime treat, ice cream, to the capital.</p><p>The campaign is being fronted by museum founders <strong>Bompas &amp; Parr</strong>. If you pledge to make the exhibition happen, not only will you have free tickets to <strong>SCOOP: The Wonderful World of Ice Cream</strong>, but your name will feature on the Patron’s Wall of Frozen Fame. Other prizes include having your face made into ice cream, and even having ice cream for breakfast with Sam Bompas and Harry Parr in five years time. </p><p>SCOOP will open at the height of summer for three months if the crowdfunding target is reached and will feature the world’s largest collection of historic ice cream paraphernalia. This never-before-exhibited collection will be drawn from 14,000 vintage equipment, service-ware, advertising, and music collected over 40 years by <strong>Robin and Caroline Weir</strong> ranging from Victorian ice cream moulds to an Andy Warhol print. Robin and Caroline Weir are the authors of the award-winning book — ""Ice Creams Sorbets and Gelati: The Definitive Guide"" from Grub Street Publishers.</p><p>The exhibition will coincide with the<strong> 300th anniversary </strong>of Mary Eales’ Receipts (1718), the first printed volume to feature ice cream in an English publication and the 399th anniversary of the first ice house built in Britain (to make ice cream) in Greenwich Park by order of James I.</p><p>A special feature of this exhibition will be a focus on the life and ingenuity of <strong>Agnes B. Marshall</strong>, known in Victorian times as the Queen of Ices. Far ahead of her time, Marshall wrote several successful cook books, patented an ice cream machine and even suggested using liquid nitrogen to make ice cream as early as the late 1800s. Visitors will get to ‘meet’ Agnes’s amanuensis as part of an immersive and interactive theatre performance. Heston Blumenthal, recipient of multiple Michelin stars, called Marshall: “one of the greatest culinary pioneers this country has ever seen.”</p><p><strong>SCOOP: The Wonderful World of Ice Cream</strong> will further include curated galleries, and a programme of talks, events, workshops and wonders including real glacial ice, ice cream weather and glow-in-the-dark ice cream. More details will be announced pending the success of the Indiegogo campaign. </p><p> </p><p><strong>About the British Museum of Food</strong></p><p>In November 2015 Bompas &amp; Parr opened the British Museum of Food, the world’s first dedicated cultural institution entirely devoted to the history, evolution, science and art of food.

The British Museum of Food is announcing a crowdfunding page to bring the first major exhibition that explores the history and sensory pleasure of the nation’s favourite summertime treat, ice cream, to the capital.The campaign is being fronted by museum founders Bompas & Parr. If you pledge to make the exhibition happen, not only will you have free tickets to SCOOP: The Wonderful World of Ice Cream, but your name will feature on the Patron’s Wall of Frozen Fame. Other prizes include having your face made into ice cream, and even having ice cream for breakfast with Sam Bompas and Harry Parr in five years time. SCOOP will open at the height of summer for three months if the crowdfunding target is reached and will feature the world’s largest collection of historic ice cream paraphernalia. This never-before-exhibited collection will be drawn from 14,000 vintage equipment, service-ware, advertising, and music collected over 40 years by Robin and Caroline Weir ranging from Victorian ice cream moulds to an Andy Warhol print. Robin and Caroline Weir are the authors of the award-winning book — ""Ice Creams Sorbets and Gelati: The Definitive Guide"" from Grub Street Publishers.The exhibition will coincide with the 300th anniversary of Mary Eales’ Receipts (1718), the first printed volume to feature ice cream in an English publication and the 399th anniversary of the first ice house built in Britain (to make ice cream) in Greenwich Park by order of James I.A special feature of this exhibition will be a focus on the life and ingenuity of Agnes B. Marshall, known in Victorian times as the Queen of Ices. Far ahead of her time, Marshall wrote several successful cook books, patented an ice cream machine and even suggested using liquid nitrogen to make ice cream as early as the late 1800s. Visitors will get to ‘meet’ Agnes’s amanuensis as part of an immersive and interactive theatre performance. Heston Blumenthal, recipient of multiple Michelin stars, called Marshall: “one of the greatest culinary pioneers this country has ever seen.”SCOOP: The Wonderful World of Ice Cream will further include curated galleries, and a programme of talks, events, workshops and wonders including real glacial ice, ice cream weather and glow-in-the-dark ice cream. More details will be announced pending the success of the Indiegogo campaign.  About the British Museum of FoodIn November 2015 Bompas & Parr opened the British Museum of Food, the world’s first dedicated cultural institution entirely devoted to the history, evolution, science and art of food. For three months, the museum presented a series of exhibits that aligned with the quirky and disruptive style of the studio’s approach to communicating food and drink, coupled with the mission, ethos and values of a new national museum open to everyone.Located at a temporary site at London’s Borough Market, Bompas & Parr collaborated with the market’s managers, trustees and traders alongside artists and scientists to initiate a new cultural institution for the capital.From a cinematic journey that positioned the audience as the food on the end of a fork and followed its journey into the body, to a chocolate research project hosted in an anechoic chamber and a temperature and humidity-controlled butterfly house, the exhibits were multi-sensory and multi-disciplinary explorations of the significance of food in our lives. In addition, the museum presented traditional museum showcases, including a gallery of disruptive food artworks and an archive of food and drink menus stretching nearly 300 years.The museum's aspirations, as it seeks a permanent home, are to change people’s lives by helping them refocus their attention on what they eat and to recognise the ways in which food impacts our culture, politics, economy and history.A multi-sensory and experiential space, the museum is committed to developing new forms of participatory art/science projects designed to provoke new thinking, spark curiosity and inspire wonder about humankind’s responses – past, present and future – of one of our basic, fundamental needs: the need to eat.www.bmof.orgAbout Bompas & ParrBompas & Parr is globally recognised as the leading expert in multi-sensory experience design. The studio works with commercial brands, artistic institutions, private clients and governments to deliver emotionally compelling experiences to a wide variety of audiences. Sam Bompas and Harry Parr first came to prominence through their expertise in jelly-making, but the business rapidly grew into a fully-fledged creative studio offering food and drink design, brand consultancy and immersive experiences across a diverse number of industries. The founders’ backgrounds in marketing and architecture play a key role in the positioning and nature of the studio’s output and, along with a diverse spread of talents among the 20-strong team, Bompas & Parr activations boast a bold ambition, distinct aesthetic style and interpretive vigour that’s unrivalled among creative agencies.

<p>We want to provide a safe and supportive environment for our member artists, communities that access our space and  audiences who attend our events.</p>
<p>Over the past 4 years we have refurbished a 5500 sq ft industrial building into a modern artist studio with studio spaces, large build workshop, photography darkroom, screen-printing darkroom and facilities, print area, project room, electronics area, meeting room and artist library. We have invested thousands of euros of personal capital, thousands of hours of sweat equity and reinvested the majority of  membership fees paid to us into the building. Now we need a little bit of help from the outside.</p>
<p>During 2017 we focused a lot of time in securing a long term lease for the building to ensure that value for money was guaranteed when investing into the building itself. In Jan 2018 we secured a 10 year lease and this means for the next 10 years we can confidently continue to provide safe and affordable studio space to artists working in Dublin.

<h3>About Lost Property Arts Collective</h3>
<p>Lost Property is a not-for-profit Community Interest Company with background in experimental and improvised music, sound and art. We are a group made up of individuals devoted to our creative endeavours and devising memorable events for curious people.</p>
<p>In 2013 we joined forces to realise the first Fort Process festival, and since then have staged some acclaimed events, such as our retrospective concerts of Terry Riley and Alvin Lucier, the film season Lumen, and our workshops in areas such as gamelan and field recording. The second Fort Process was another great success, held in 2016.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Fort Process</h3>
<p>Fort Process is a unique festival that has grown to establish an important place on the UK experimental events calendar. It is held within Newhaven Fort, a 19th century structure built to protect the coast of Newhaven, East Sussex. This site offers a dizzying number of spaces of all shapes and sizes, each possessing a unique sonic and visual character. There are tunnels, arches and caverns that draw visitors through the ground itself and into the depths of the interior. These possess rich resonant and reverberant acoustics. The exterior features numerous fortifications dotted over the grasslands, some facing out across the English channel. In every case the setting provides a remarkably unconventional backdrop for installations, performances and interactive experiences.</p>
<p>Fort Process is as much about the journey as it is about the individual acts on the programme. Festival goers have an opportunity to explore the grounds throughout the day, uncovering more and more as they go. </p>
<p>Our curation offers opportunities to national and international artists working at all levels; we work with young, emerging creators as well as high profile names whose influence spans decades, and we involve a significant number of locals, showcasing the talents of those living and working in the East Sussex area. The festival also helps draw attention to Newhaven, a quiet port town that links the UK with the continent. </p>
<p>More information on the festival can be found on our website: <a href=""http://fortprocess.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://fortprocess.co.uk</a> </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What's the deal?</h3>
<p>We need to raise some funds as part of our arrangement with Arts Council England, so we're doing it in a way that offers you some bargains and rather special Fort Process memorabilia. This extra funding will help us execute an amazing festival. Items on offer include:</p>
<ul>
<li>T-shirts and tote bags: a new look to match the 2018 event theme, these are hand screen printed in Brighton and are available in various sizes.<br/> </li>
<li>Great ticket bundle deals: with these deals you can save money on the standard ticket price and bring along friends and family.<br/> </li>
<li>Workshops - we are offering tickets to the Tasos Stamou instrument building workshop that is scheduled for 23rd September in Newhaven, the day after the main event.  <br/> </li>
<li>Fort Processor synths: these have been designed and built especially for the festival by Tim Drage and Lisa McKendrick, taking their visual design from the shape of the site itself. They are available as DIY PCB circuits, with fully built synths available too. The design progress is being published on their blog here; <a href=""https://isntses.weebly.com/blog"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://isntses.weebly.com/blog</a>   Please note that as this is a newly developed model there may be some difference between the plans they have posted and the finished  item.  </li>

In every case the setting provides a remarkably unconventional backdrop for installations, performances and interactive experiences.
Fort Process is as much about the journey as it is about the individual acts on the programme. Festival goers have an opportunity to explore the grounds throughout the day, uncovering more and more as they go. 
Our curation offers opportunities to national and international artists working at all levels; we work with young, emerging creators as well as high profile names whose influence spans decades, and we involve a significant number of locals, showcasing the talents of those living and working in the East Sussex area. The festival also helps draw attention to Newhaven, a quiet port town that links the UK with the continent. 
More information on the festival can be found on our website: http://fortprocess.co.uk 
 

What's the deal?
We need to raise some funds as part of our arrangement with Arts Council England, so we're doing it in a way that offers you some bargains and rather special Fort Process memorabilia. This extra funding will help us execute an amazing festival. Items on offer include:

T-shirts and tote bags: a new look to match the 2018 event theme, these are hand screen printed in Brighton and are available in various sizes. 
Great ticket bundle deals: with these deals you can save money on the standard ticket price and bring along friends and family. 
Workshops - we are offering tickets to the Tasos Stamou instrument building workshop that is scheduled for 23rd September in Newhaven, the day after the main event.   
Fort Processor synths: these have been designed and built especially for the festival by Tim Drage and Lisa McKendrick, taking their visual design from the shape of the site itself. They are available as DIY PCB circuits, with fully built synths available too. The design progress is being published on their blog here; https://isntses.weebly.com/blog   Please note that as this is a newly developed model there may be some difference between the plans they have posted and the finished  item.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are the <strong>oldest international theatre organisation in the world</strong>, the Union Internationale de la Marionnette (<a href=""https://www.unima.org/fr/unima/presentation/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">UNIMA</a>), a Non-Governmental Organization affiliated to UNESCO. Our association is made up of a vast body of people (more than 7000 members), coming from all over the world, who believe in puppetry and<strong> human values</strong>, and whose aim is to promote the art of puppetry. </p>
<p>We are entering a very special year for our association: UNIMA's 90th anniversary. We must celebrate its long history, as a tribute to our founders and there is no a better way to do it than working together with the new generations,  to make known our history, our heritage and therefore, be able to think about the future.</p>
<p>Today, two main axes of the organization are reflected into these two events:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Youth</strong>, with a project named <i>“4 Creations, 4 continents”</i>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Heritage</strong>, with an exposition called <i>“People &amp; Puppets. UNIMA: Believing in and Creating a Common Future for Puppetry (1929 - 2019)”</i> and the edition of the book, the catalogue of the exhibition: The History of UNIMA.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Dear friends of puppetry world, Dear colleagues,</p>
<p>To achieve our goal, to be able to develop the projects we have in mind, we need your help, we need your support. The cost of these two events is not as expensive as it could be but we need more money than we have, and even though we are getting some special grants from French and Spanish Institutions, still it is not enough, we need more money. Therefore, WE COUNT ON YOU. We have set a goal to reach 20.000<strong>€. </strong>Your contributions will help us a lot to carry out these two huge projects. On one hand, the staging of the work ""Customs"" that will be done by young people coming from different countries, different cultures, having a unique experience full of values like cooperation, integration, interculturalism, universalism, mutual understanding and peace. On the other hand, the exhibition “People &amp; Puppets. UNIMA: Believing in and Creating a Common Future for Puppetry (1929 - 2019)” that will help to keep alive a long puppetry history and to show it to a wide audience.</p>
<p>UNIMA is generous and, especially during this year of anniversary, likes to recognize those that help the organization, so we have designed these original perks related to UNIMA  and puppetry world. We hope you will like them:</p>
<ul>
<li>UNIMA Screen saver</li>
<li>UNIMA 90th Anniversary Poster</li>
<li>UNIMA Totebag</li>

<li> VIP access and guided tour to the exhibition “People &amp; Puppets. UNIMA: Believing in and Creating a Common Future for Puppetry (1929 - 2019)” during the FMTM in Charleville- Mézières, France. (Date to be confirmed: from 20 to 29 September)</li>

<li>Shadow collector puppet: Specially designed, handmade and painted in leather by <strong>Andhra Pradesh</strong>, shadow puppeter from India.</li>
<li>Limited edition numbered illustration</li>

<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As mentioned before we are now focusing the activity of our association on two fundamental pillars:</p>
<p><strong>Youth</strong></p>
<p>We want to point out the importance of the values and ideas of <strong>universalism, openness and cooperation</strong>, which have been promoted since the creation of our association in 1929, and to emphasize its relevance.</p>
<p>To do this, we are creating the project: 4 creations, 4 continents</p>
<p>The five geographical zones, joined in four, that make up UNIMA (Europe, America, Asia-Pacific and Africa) will propose a different version of the same story, using puppets. Each zone will be represented by schools and / or young puppeteers that will work together coming from different countries in their continent and will create an original production.</p>
<p>They will work on the same scenario, CUSTOMS, of the young Brazilian puppeteer Marcos Nicolaïewsky, who was selected by the international jury, last September in Charleville-Mézières. Marcos shares UNIMA's desire to eliminate borders and spread common values for <strong>peace and art.</strong></p>
<p>The four creations will be presented at the next UNIMA Congress in Bali, in 2020, giving all people there the possibility of appreciating how the same work can be interpreted depending on where you are coming from.</p>
<p>The objective of this initiative is to emphasize the importance of values like <strong>cooperation, integration, interculturalism, universalism, mutual understanding, and peace…</strong> through puppetry art</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Heritage</strong></p>
<p>On the era of the technology we must preserve our roots, our history, OUR ANCESTRAL ART. We must not forget that puppetry is one of the oldest art. The art that became the founding element of many theatrical adventures of the 20th and 21st centuries...</p>
<p>Our goal is to make visible the evolution and progress of the puppetry arts throughout the history of those who have ""made"" UNIMA.</p>
<p>For this, our organization carries out the exhibition project: “People &amp; Puppets. UNIMA: Believing in and Creating a Common Future for Puppetry (1929 - 2019)”. An exhibition in which we will be able to see the history of puppetry</p>
<p>Through this exhibition, one can see what an important role UNIMA has played and continues to play in the world of puppetry – from the <strong>development of the medium, to training new puppeteers and preserving the old traditions, and spreading puppetry</strong> from one continent to the other.</p>
<p>UNIMA has played a very important and critical role in bringing together puppeteers from all over the world.  This exhibition highlights that role, showing how many countries in which UNIMA has National Centers, keep puppetry alive, and help puppeteers and local talent to achieve their objectives.</p>
<p>With this exhibition, UNIMA will also pay tribute to the important Individuals who believed in puppetry, and were able to create a Common Future for all of us. We, those that are the successors of our founders, are obliged to continue bringing the torch forward as they do in the Olympic Games. <strong>We cannot let this bright fire extinguish, we must keep the fire alive for the future generations, and keep the emotions alive, so that this millennial art will continue living and flourish year after year.</strong></p>
<p> </p>

The objective of this initiative is to emphasize the importance of values like cooperation, integration, interculturalism, universalism, mutual understanding, and peace… through puppetry art
 
Heritage
On the era of the technology we must preserve our roots, our history, OUR ANCESTRAL ART. We must not forget that puppetry is one of the oldest art. The art that became the founding element of many theatrical adventures of the 20th and 21st centuries...
Our goal is to make visible the evolution and progress of the puppetry arts throughout the history of those who have ""made"" UNIMA.
For this, our organization carries out the exhibition project: “People & Puppets. UNIMA: Believing in and Creating a Common Future for Puppetry (1929 - 2019)”. An exhibition in which we will be able to see the history of puppetry
Through this exhibition, one can see what an important role UNIMA has played and continues to play in the world of puppetry – from the development of the medium, to training new puppeteers and preserving the old traditions, and spreading puppetry from one continent to the other.
UNIMA has played a very important and critical role in bringing together puppeteers from all over the world.  This exhibition highlights that role, showing how many countries in which UNIMA has National Centers, keep puppetry alive, and help puppeteers and local talent to achieve their objectives.
With this exhibition, UNIMA will also pay tribute to the important Individuals who believed in puppetry, and were able to create a Common Future for all of us.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h2>Overview</h2><p>Celebrating the Asian American LGBTQ+ Experience is an annual community event founded by author CB Lee that brings together LGBTQ+ Asian Americans for an evening of discussion, performances, and audience Q&amp;A in historic downtown Los Angeles as part of Lambda Litfest. This year's event takes place on September 27, 2019 at the Chinese American Museum with Kay Ulunday Barrett, Nick Dong, Addie Tsai, Henry Lien, and Muriel Leung, moderated by CB Lee, and is free to the public.</p><h3>WHY LGBTQ+ ASIAN AMERICAN EVENTS?</h3><p>Hello! I’m CB Lee, author of the SIDEKICK SQUAD series. As a queer Chinese-Vietnamese American, growing up, I felt pretty isolated and unsure of who I was, as part of the LGBTQ+ community and growing up as part of multiple cultures. Maya Reddy states in the Mission Statement of the Gaysian Project, “When we are not seen, we are not known. That sense of loneliness is overpowering. Rarely are all Asian ethnicities recognized. And just as rarely are all identities of queerness celebrated, especially within Asian American representation.”  Representation is just a small part of this event—it’s about creating and fostering community.</p><p> As a writer, I seek to tell stories that not only entertain but also inspire others and show inclusive characters who reflect the world we live in. In 2017, I curated the first iteration of this event in partnership with the Chinese American Museum, and was overwhelmed by the amount of amazing people who turned up for what I thought would be a modest reading and panel. Instead, the CAM courtyard overflowed with community and people who came together to see our performers, explore the exhibits and participate in a lively discussion. This year, with your support, I’m hoping to create a unique and enriching experience for the community, working with the Chinese American Museum and the Gaysian Project to encourage people to explore the amazing exhibits at the museum and also participate in an evening of discussion.</p><p>CELEBRASIANQ seeks to bring together Asian Americans in the LGBTQ+ community with events that celebrate who they are in a space that inspires creativity, conversation and celebration.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>2019: CELEBRATING THE ASIAN AMERICAN LGBTQ+ EXPERIENCE</h3><p> </p><p>CELEBRATING THE ASIAN AMERICAN LGBTQ+ EXPERIENCE brings together Asian American artists, writers, and creative industry professionals in the LGBTQ+ community in historic downtown Los Angeles at the Chinese American Museum for Lambda Literary’s LitFest 2019 for an evening of community and celebrating art and creativity. CAM’s current exhibition, “Lightscapes: Reenvisioning the Shanshuihua,” reimagines the philosophies of Chinese landscape paintings with new media and immersive light-based installations.

This year's event takes place on September 27, 2019 at the Chinese American Museum with Kay Ulunday Barrett, Nick Dong, Addie Tsai, Henry Lien, and Muriel Leung, moderated by CB Lee, and is free to the public.WHY LGBTQ+ ASIAN AMERICAN EVENTS?Hello! I’m CB Lee, author of the SIDEKICK SQUAD series. As a queer Chinese-Vietnamese American, growing up, I felt pretty isolated and unsure of who I was, as part of the LGBTQ+ community and growing up as part of multiple cultures. Maya Reddy states in the Mission Statement of the Gaysian Project, “When we are not seen, we are not known. That sense of loneliness is overpowering. Rarely are all Asian ethnicities recognized. And just as rarely are all identities of queerness celebrated, especially within Asian American representation.”  Representation is just a small part of this event—it’s about creating and fostering community. As a writer, I seek to tell stories that not only entertain but also inspire others and show inclusive characters who reflect the world we live in. In 2017, I curated the first iteration of this event in partnership with the Chinese American Museum, and was overwhelmed by the amount of amazing people who turned up for what I thought would be a modest reading and panel. Instead, the CAM courtyard overflowed with community and people who came together to see our performers, explore the exhibits and participate in a lively discussion. This year, with your support, I’m hoping to create a unique and enriching experience for the community, working with the Chinese American Museum and the Gaysian Project to encourage people to explore the amazing exhibits at the museum and also participate in an evening of discussion.CELEBRASIANQ seeks to bring together Asian Americans in the LGBTQ+ community with events that celebrate who they are in a space that inspires creativity, conversation and celebration.   2019: CELEBRATING THE ASIAN AMERICAN LGBTQ+ EXPERIENCE CELEBRATING THE ASIAN AMERICAN LGBTQ+ EXPERIENCE brings together Asian American artists, writers, and creative industry professionals in the LGBTQ+ community in historic downtown Los Angeles at the Chinese American Museum for Lambda Literary’s LitFest 2019 for an evening of community and celebrating art and creativity. CAM’s current exhibition, “Lightscapes: Reenvisioning the Shanshuihua,” reimagines the philosophies of Chinese landscape paintings with new media and immersive light-based installations. The masters of Chinese landscape art would often retreat to nature to examine the themes of harmony and balance in the cosmos, as well as find sanctuary in nature. For the LGBTQ+ community, finding balance and safety to express ourselves is one of the challenges of everyday life. Where do we go as a community to retreat and how do we find balance in our lives?Lambda Literary and CAM invite you to join us for an evening of special performances, poetry readings and activities articulated with CAM’s current exhibitions and “Lightscapes: Reenvisioning the Shanshuihua, featuring KAY ULUNDAY BARRETT, MURIEL LEUNG, NICK DONG, ADDIE TSAI, HENRY LIEN and moderated by CB Lee. Followed by a panel discussion and networking reception, this multimedia event celebrates art and creativity at the intersection of Asian American identity and the LGBTQ+ community.  THE IMPACTCommunity events like these are pivotal towards our understanding of ourselves and others, and offer a chance for people within the community to meet others, to validate their existence and to see that they are not alone in their experience. This celebration inspires and invigorates the culture of arts and creativity and also provides a way for people to connect and discover new creators and works to support.  GOALS EVENT LAUNCHOrganizing events like this requires investment in administrative organizing, donations to nonprofit venues, managing volunteers, and also paying for necessary expenses such as audio and visual equipment rentals, staging, lighting, parking, and providing honorariums for speakers. As working artists and creators, it is important to compensate people for their valuable time and to value their contributions. DONATION TO CAUSES WE BELIEVE INOur goal is to raise enough funds to donate to our venue, the Chinese American Museum, a 501C nonprofit organization, and also three nonprofits we believe strongly in: Lambda Literary, CAPE, and the Trevor Project. AN ANNUAL CELEBRATION AND MORE We also want to continue to curate this event annually, and expand and grow as a point of connection for our community, and be able to sponsor short films and more events like these. HOW YOU CAN HELPWe have a number of ways you can support this event, regardless if you wish to attend the September 27, 2019 event in Los Angeles.

<p><u><strong>Infringement</strong></u></p>
<p>The Infringement Festival is a vital part of Buffalo's art culture, and a summer tradition that's been going strong for 15 years. We have acts that cover theater, music, art, dance, spoken word, film, and even some artists that defy genre categorizations altogether.  All proceeds---cover charges, pass-the-hat donations---go directly to the artists, with the bare minimum set aside to cover technical expenses. We need your financial help to produce the festival program and cover technical expenses.</p>
<p>Can you support us in this endeavor? You'll be able to say that you directly support the arts in Buffalo.</p>
<p><u><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></u></p>
<p>We publish a large insert in the Public, one of the local ""alternative"" weeklies, as well as ads in other publications. We also rent PA and stage gear for a limited number of venues.</p>
<p>We still need about $2000, on top of what we've raised through fundraiser concerts.</p>
<p>We offer festival t-shirts and stickers/decals as rewards for funding us.</p>
<p>Every little bit counts. We've never fallen short, and with your help, 2018 will be no different.</p>
<p><u><strong>Impact</strong></u></p>
<p>We are the largest (but not the only) festival of our kind. Although the original Infringement Festival was started and is still run in Montreal, QC by one of the original founders, Buffalo's festival is the only one that has expanded to 11 days and 400+ artists.</p>
<p>Your donation supports artists. It allows for works to be presented both in interesting, unique spaces and by artists who do not normally get a lot of exposure. We cover a range of aesthetics, experience-levels, and we allow artists to get out of their comfort zones and present original, new, and challenging work.</p>
<p>Your donation also supports audiences. Without the people who come out to shows, this festival would not continue to exist.</p>
<p><u><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></u></p>
<p>There is always the risk of a budgetary shortfall, or that some venue will suddenly close. Our organizer committee is our biggest strength. Collectively, we have 100+ years of experience making this thing a reality. We are also constantly bringing in new people to help us figure out how to make things happen.</p>
<p><u><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></u></p>
<p>We understand that you may not be able to help us financially. Here's how you can help us:</p>
<p>Share our campaign with your networks.</p>

<p>My name is Matt Gilbert. I'm Gwich'in Athabascan. I grew  up in Arctic Village, Alaska, but I travelled arounda  lot in the states and overseas. I returned home and finished my Masters Degree in Rural Development with my thesis on oral history translations of ancient Gwich'in stories. The work lead to cultural preservation work that lasted 7 years.</p>
<p>About 4 years ago, I worked with an Elder Kias who was 90 years-old, because no one had ever spoken to him. Fearing all his knowledge would be lost, I walked over to his house and worked with him on commenting on an existing placename map. Little did I know, this would lead to 4 years of hard work mapping traditional placenames and trails and adding to the placename data that had already been done by Richard Caulfield in 1980. </p>
<p>I hired dozens of Gwich'in Elders and Hunters in almost all the Gwich'in villages to comment on work that had already been done in Gwich'in Placename mapping and also adding new commentary to the existing ones. </p>
<p>The work is now culminating in a giant database system that the Council of Athabascan Tribal Governments and the University of Alaska Fairbanks have partnered to create. This giant database will include all Gwich'in Placename and trails. I will add my materials to it too, and then it will turn into a Web Portal, which will be accessible to any Gwich'in person with a computer. </p>
<p>I need $500.00, $400 of it will go toward paying the fees of Barret Ristroph, so she can help me complete my Gwich'in maps by September 15, because the company I am contracted with gave me the date to complete the work. The rest will be fees associated with using IndieGoGo and miscellaneous expenses related to the project. </p>
<p>Barrett Ristroph is a PhD Student at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, but also has a law degree. She will be assisting me with two things: </p>
<p>1. She will bring together hand-drawn notes and maps from various elders and organizing them according to place. </p>
<p>2. She will draft notes or transcripts associated with a place and enter them into Google Earth. </p>
<p>I will hire her for 4 hours, so she will finish the Arctic Village Placenames and trails. The two Elders left to do in Arctic Village is Gideon and Allen, their information and placename information is vast, so Barrett will organize it and enter the information into Google Earth or a customized database, while I finish Venetie's vast information. </p>
<p>We hope to finish by September 15. </p>
<p>The perks of the Gwich'in Postcards is something that was required by IndieGoGo, but I can make those for you. </p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal, the funds will to get as many hours as I can out of my assistant to finish the project. </p>
<p>I have been completing these projects like this for 4 years. I will get it done. </p>
<p>By donating, you will be apart of an historical event. </p>

</div></div>","My name is Matt Gilbert. I'm Gwich'in Athabascan. I grew  up in Arctic Village, Alaska, but I travelled arounda  lot in the states and overseas. I returned home and finished my Masters Degree in Rural Development with my thesis on oral history translations of ancient Gwich'in stories. The work lead to cultural preservation work that lasted 7 years.
About 4 years ago, I worked with an Elder Kias who was 90 years-old, because no one had ever spoken to him. Fearing all his knowledge would be lost, I walked over to his house and worked with him on commenting on an existing placename map. Little did I know, this would lead to 4 years of hard work mapping traditional placenames and trails and adding to the placename data that had already been done by Richard Caulfield in 1980. 
I hired dozens of Gwich'in Elders and Hunters in almost all the Gwich'in villages to comment on work that had already been done in Gwich'in Placename mapping and also adding new commentary to the existing ones. 
The work is now culminating in a giant database system that the Council of Athabascan Tribal Governments and the University of Alaska Fairbanks have partnered to create. This giant database will include all Gwich'in Placename and trails. I will add my materials to it too, and then it will turn into a Web Portal, which will be accessible to any Gwich'in person with a computer. 
I need $500.00, $400 of it will go toward paying the fees of Barret Ristroph, so she can help me complete my Gwich'in maps by September 15, because the company I am contracted with gave me the date to complete the work. The rest will be fees associated with using IndieGoGo and miscellaneous expenses related to the project. 
Barrett Ristroph is a PhD Student at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, but also has a law degree. She will be assisting me with two things: 
1. She will bring together hand-drawn notes and maps from various elders and organizing them according to place. 
2. She will draft notes or transcripts associated with a place and enter them into Google Earth. 
I will hire her for 4 hours, so she will finish the Arctic Village Placenames and trails. The two Elders left to do in Arctic Village is Gideon and Allen, their information and placename information is vast, so Barrett will organize it and enter the information into Google Earth or a customized database, while I finish Venetie's vast information. 
We hope to finish by September 15. 
The perks of the Gwich'in Postcards is something that was required by IndieGoGo, but I can make those for you. 
If I don't reach my goal, the funds will to get as many hours as I can out of my assistant to finish the project. 
I have been completing these projects like this for 4 years. I will get it done. 
By donating, you will be apart of an historical event.

It is our hope that we can make a modest but enduring contribution to the building of such a place.</p><h3> </h3><h3>From So Boring to Black Window</h3><p>In a previous incarnation, we were once known as the So Boring kitchen, a ramshackle hole in the wall vegan ‘restaurant’ operating on the street. On any given night, you could show up and find yourself faced with a menu packed with dishes that you had never heard of, pairing, perhaps, a Cantonese soup with a West African stew and Thai pudding for dessert. For lack of waiting staff, you would have to find a place on the curb among a throng of misfits, place an order in a cramped, noisy hole-in-the-wall kitchen and patiently await the arrival of food that could very possibly be sold out by the time the cooks begin preparing your portion. </p><p> </p><p>Despite all of this, So Boring became an infamous destination for the adventurous, the destitute, and of course those who wanted a nutritious meal and company without having much money to pay for it. So infamous, in fact, that the district councillor became as ardent to snuff out this den of vagrants as he did all the impromptu homeless shacks that have been wiped out in the area over the years. Tired of the constant raids by government departments invoked by the councillor and realizing that our tiny space had perhaps exhausted its potential, we decided to close the space and the street that we had inhabited  with friends near and far for the better part of 6 years. Too much of our time and energy ,time that could have been devoted to endeavors that were far more worthwhile, was occupied in our efforts to evade and defy the letter of the law, dodging punishment for not being a properly licensed and registered restaurant. This evasion was not motivated by a simple taste for criminality, we simply did not regard ourselves as being a restaurant, and we certainly didn’t treat the street as the dining room for a food and beverage establishment. The space that housed our kitchen just happened to serve food, but serving food was simply one among many things that we did, though it eventually became the case that everything else that we did was eclipsed by the kitchen, its notoriety and the demands that it placed upon those of us who had to keep it running through times of scarcity and need. Also, there was the fact that people who came to the kitchen had no real idea about the people behind it, what exactly their principles were beyond the odd political pronouncement every now and then on our social media, what other things they were engaged in. As a consequence, it was easy to mistake those of us in the kitchen as being ‘chefs’ in the business of cooking for clientele.</p><p> </p><p>It is clear, then, that we need a considerably bigger space, for one thing, and that we need to license and register it properly, for another, so that we don’t waste inordinate amounts of time devising strategies to outsmart the authorities. All of this attention and concern will instead go into coordinating screenings, curating our library, organizing discussions and workshops, as well as creating a solid and sustainable basis to support ourselves and, hopefully, other folks that require our support or assistance (for example, So Boring once ran collaborative nights with the Bethune House, which provides shelter for domestic migrant workers in need, and which was facing closure because of the withdrawal of funding). Because we have resolved to maintain appearances and adopt the guise, superficially at least, of a ‘legit’ restaurant, this will create costs and headaches that we have never known before. This is also why, despite all of our own efforts to save money ourselves, we are asking for your kind and deeply appreciated assistance to build the foundations of our space, and to help us establish a reserve fund so that we can weather the unpredictability of the post-pandemic climate and create a foundation upon which we can continue to build for the next few years.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619951708/pomgo94sj1yqhh3ifwt8.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619951707/dieaphylpiuklj5ug03v.jpg"" src=""""/><br/>Charity dinner for Bethune House, a migrant domestic workers' shelter in Hong Kong.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619951730/eraeabg4os7tqbakd0jz.png"" src=""""/><br/>Screening on the street.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619951930/ekn07ou4klawjwcv1ums.jpg"" src=""""/><br/>Street market held in the neighborhood.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619951788/seyztberbwte1zh0p14e.png"" src=""""/><br/>Zines and independent music albums.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619951949/qbwt5rwivemrptamxz0b.jpg"" src=""""/><br/>Farewell Yau Ma Tei.

This evasion was not motivated by a simple taste for criminality, we simply did not regard ourselves as being a restaurant, and we certainly didn’t treat the street as the dining room for a food and beverage establishment. The space that housed our kitchen just happened to serve food, but serving food was simply one among many things that we did, though it eventually became the case that everything else that we did was eclipsed by the kitchen, its notoriety and the demands that it placed upon those of us who had to keep it running through times of scarcity and need. Also, there was the fact that people who came to the kitchen had no real idea about the people behind it, what exactly their principles were beyond the odd political pronouncement every now and then on our social media, what other things they were engaged in. As a consequence, it was easy to mistake those of us in the kitchen as being ‘chefs’ in the business of cooking for clientele. It is clear, then, that we need a considerably bigger space, for one thing, and that we need to license and register it properly, for another, so that we don’t waste inordinate amounts of time devising strategies to outsmart the authorities. All of this attention and concern will instead go into coordinating screenings, curating our library, organizing discussions and workshops, as well as creating a solid and sustainable basis to support ourselves and, hopefully, other folks that require our support or assistance (for example, So Boring once ran collaborative nights with the Bethune House, which provides shelter for domestic migrant workers in need, and which was facing closure because of the withdrawal of funding). Because we have resolved to maintain appearances and adopt the guise, superficially at least, of a ‘legit’ restaurant, this will create costs and headaches that we have never known before. This is also why, despite all of our own efforts to save money ourselves, we are asking for your kind and deeply appreciated assistance to build the foundations of our space, and to help us establish a reserve fund so that we can weather the unpredictability of the post-pandemic climate and create a foundation upon which we can continue to build for the next few years.Charity dinner for Bethune House, a migrant domestic workers' shelter in Hong Kong.Screening on the street.Street market held in the neighborhood.Zines and independent music albums.Farewell Yau Ma Tei.

<p><strong>Iwaya Community Art Festival (I C A F Lagos)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>
<p>Inhabit in a coastal community, which largely dominated by low-income earners, I C A F Lagos aim is to provide access for underprivileged people in the community to experience art and to develop space for intercultural dialogue on socio-political issues that shapes our daily lives. Through our program activities, we further aim:</p>
<p>to enhance community-driven initiatives to celebrate their sense of place</p>
<p>to strengthen the role of youth in the community to voice their perspectives about their ideal living space</p>
<p>to provide platforms for both artistic and cultural exchange</p> <p><strong>Communal Re-Imagination</strong></p>

<p><strong>(students of Communal Re-Imagination, an alternative art school project funded by Prince Claus Fund, participating in a performance by Yusuf Durodola)</strong></p>
<p>After two years of focusing on issues that are more transnational in scope, the Artistic Director of Iwaya Community Art Festival — I C A F Lagos, has decided to address a domestic issue from an inclusive perspective. Communal Re-Imagination as the theme of the third edition of I C A F Lagos is adapted from the year-long alternative community art school project by the Vernacular Art-space Laboratory, in Iwaya Community.</p>
<p>Iwaya as a community is not static, it has changed over time. Lagos as an urban space has also evolved with time both in aesthetics and population; the latter explains the intensive quest for survival and also why many people do not smile any more in public spaces. Similar to some big cities around the world, depression has become a sickness that the state now identifies as one of  the periodic causes of deaths on its Lagoon.</p>
<p>I C A F Lagos 2018 is immersed in the interconnectedness of “villages” — (communities) within Lagos City to ignite the fundamentality of its public space. Lagos as a city is made up of several communities (villages) that have different socio-cultural facilities distributed on its Island and Mainland. The economic hub of the city was by default built on the Island owing to its waterways that are linked to the Atlantic Ocean and this limits functional communal spaces on the mainland where Iwaya, as a village, is a suburb of the city.</p>
<p>Static communities are unliveable; they confine people to their homes and repress their minds and souls. To debunk this stagnation that befalls our villages within urban spaces, urbanism has to be employed to regenerate spaces for a new utopia. Communal Re-Imagination seeks creative confluence through open-source with architects, anthropologists, socio-cultural historians and artists to restructure our static villages that are rustic in mood in order to re-dynamise their architectural presence and relevance. Through open source and right resources, together, villages can be rebuilt and the mood and culture of the villagers will be reactivated.</p>
<p>With the theme of I C A F Lagos 2018, the festival proposes a collaboration between people living within the community who understand both the socio-cultural notion and anthropological nuances of Iwaya and visual narratives from the participating artists. This collaboration intends to redesign the architectural fabric through a merger of native ideas and contemporary artistic practices in the creation of functional alternative spaces and installation of objects culminating in the regeneration of the community.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the political class and community leaders are requested to be the moderators in this urbanism discourse on space re-appropriation for popular culture narrative as an alternative platform to annexing the immense but uncultivated energy of the youth that permeates Iwaya Community. All players will harmoniously animate Iwaya as a village with suggestions and narratives through this dialogue.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Project Plan and Timeframe</strong></p>
<p>The third and fourth edition of ICAF Lagos in 2018 and 2019 respectively will focus on the regeneration of the community through partnership with local residents who are experts of daily live, community-based organizations, interdisciplinary artists and creative practitioners from Nigeria and West Africa countries, and importantly, youth in Iwaya community. To further explore various forms of social practices within the contemporary art field, we are intended to focus on art practices that are actively engaging with diverse social, cultural, architectural and historical context. </p>

<p>OjoRojo was founded by a group of concerned photojournalists and photography teachers in 2016. Located in the center of Bogotá, OjoRojo has become an important reference point in the world of Colombian and Latin American photography: a training center where journalistic rigor is taught; the development of a personal vision is stimulated; and a space for exhibitions and gatherings with authors. At OjoRojo documentary photography is conceived as a tool that strengthens democracy and the free exchange of information, essential values for a more inclusive and peaceful society.</p>

<p>Hi there! I'm Nora, and this campaign would send me to Tokyo, Japan in October for ten days.</p>
<p>I've been before, and would love to return. I love the culture, every part of it. The cities, the towns, the food, the people. It all feels like home to me. I feel more myself than I ever have there, and I would love to go back with your help.</p>
<p>I have a magnitude of perks in mind for those generous and kind enough to help me achieve this!</p>

</div><div>
<p>I've set the goal for this campaign at $2,000. This goal will cover the costs of the flight, the hotel, and other expenses during the trip.</p>
<p>Such expenses include:</p>
<ul>
<li>food and dining to sustain my ever growing form</li>
<li>a day trip to Mt. Fuji and hot springs at the base of the mountain (exclusive lewd photos of this are a perk)</li>
<li>a possible day trip to Kyoto, time and funds permitting</li>
<li>train fare - from and to the airport, and daily transportation</li>
<li>maid cafe with cute cute cute girls</li>
<li>sumo wrestling tournament or kabuki show</li>
<li>more cute girls</li>
<li>souvenirs - for myself and for you!</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all fluid plans, depending on if we meet goal! If we don't reach our goal, the funds will still go towards the trip. Every cent helps, and I've been saving as much as I can myself. </p>

</div></div>","Hi there! I'm Nora, and this campaign would send me to Tokyo, Japan in October for ten days.
I've been before, and would love to return. I love the culture, every part of it. The cities, the towns, the food, the people. It all feels like home to me. I feel more myself than I ever have there, and I would love to go back with your help.
I have a magnitude of perks in mind for those generous and kind enough to help me achieve this!
I EVEN LEARNED HIRAGANA SO I CAN READ THE SIGNS OH DEAR GOD私を助けてください?


I've set the goal for this campaign at $2,000. This goal will cover the costs of the flight, the hotel, and other expenses during the trip.
Such expenses include:

food and dining to sustain my ever growing form
a day trip to Mt. Fuji and hot springs at the base of the mountain (exclusive lewd photos of this are a perk)
a possible day trip to Kyoto, time and funds permitting
train fare - from and to the airport, and daily transportation
maid cafe with cute cute cute girls
sumo wrestling tournament or kabuki show
more cute girls
souvenirs - for myself and for you!

These are all fluid plans, depending on if we meet goal! If we don't reach our goal, the funds will still go towards the trip. Every cent helps, and I've been saving as much as I can myself. 
Many perks are available! :) Please don't hesitate to contact me here or via Twitter if you'd like a custom perk or would like to add to them.


I understand that some people can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help out in other ways. Even a dollar is lovely!

<p>Tha Seachdain na Gàidhlig air a ruith le comataidh saor-thoileach, le diofar buidhnean agus daoine a' gabhail pàirt ann. </p>

<p>Thòisich Seachdain na Gàidhlig aig Oilthigh Dhùn Èideann ann an 2014 le coig tachartasan. Ann an 2015, às dèidh dà fhèis shoirbheachail, chaidh aontachadh gum bu chòir dhan fhèis a bhuntainn ris a' bhaile air fad. </p>
<p><i>The Edinburgh Gaelic Festival began at the University of Edinburgh in 2014 with only five events. In 2015, after two successful weeks, it was decided that the festival should belong to all of Edinburgh.</i></p>

<p><i>Last year, we had around 30 events. We've been growing each year, and we'd like to keep on growing! Our festival offers something for everyone, from those who would like to know more about Gaelic to those who are fluent speakers.</i></p>

<p><i>We are very grateful for past funding we've had from the University of Edinburgh, Comann na Gàidhlig, and Bòrd na Gàidhlig, and we're now in a position to move toward a more 'grassroots' model.</i></p>

<p>My name is Sean Moore and I'm the founder of Swans Nest Yoga.  I was born with a good lottery ticket - great family, safe neighborhood, and access to a multitude of opportunities and life experiences.  I've worked on Wall Street, DJ'ed in New York City, and travelled the world while working for Acumen - an international organization bringing innovative and affordable goods and services to the poor.  My life has been blessed in many ways.  But like many of us, I've struggled with anxiety, depression and finding fulfillment. </p>
<p>There's a teaching from the Rigveda - an ancient Indian philosophical text - that states ""Truth is One, Paths Are Many.""  Yoga has been my path towards Truth, or a feeling of wholeness within myself.  I began teaching yoga in studios and out of my apartment in New York City in 2016 and spent two months studying at the KPJAYI institute in Mysore, India in early 2018.  It was there that I committed to launching my own yoga school, and on August 18, 2018, I opened the doors to Swans Nest Yoga.</p>
<p>After a great first 7 months laying down roots, building community, and spending way too much time trying to insulate a drafty window with plastic sheets and a hair dryer (3rd time's the charm!), I now have the exciting opportunity to expand the yoga room and create a vibrant entrance room for workshops, creative events, and general hang time! </p>
<p>I'm raising $15,555 to finance this expansion and implement the first installation of ""Burning To Live"":  A 12 week workshop intended to help us connect with our authentic selves and reach our full potential through regular yoga practice, exploration of Eastern and Western philosophies, creative projects, and exposure to spiritual and wisdom teachings such as the Enneagram, Numerology, Astrology and Tarot.  </p>
<p>As a new yoga school in New York City we are still building our student base and will need to continue to grow to become financially sustainable.  With your support, as well as the commitment of our current investors, I believe we will be able to build an exciting and influential organization that can sustain itself in the long-term and be of service to anyone seeking out the teachings of yoga.  </p>
<p>Yoga has been the most impactful tool I've found to reduce stress, anxiety and depression in my life and increase joy and purpose within myself.  By supporting this campaign you will enable us to create a truly special yoga shala for students to practice in, learn about themselves, express their creativity, and reach their highest potential.  I would be so grateful for any level of donation you can provide and am extremely excited to continue to build this community with your support!</p>

My brothers and I opened the doors of Nine Dot Gallery in Worcester, MA in 2015. Our mission was to create a space that would be a real resource in supporting our creative community. Fast-forward to over 50 events, 24 exhibitions, and one relocation later we now share space with the Southeast Asian Coalition of Central Massachusetts. This move ushered a more social justice focus in collaboration with our refugee and immigrant artist and maker community. </p><p><strong>On The Go</strong></p><p>To facilitate more cultural exchange, we have decided to pay it forward. On May 22nd, we will be in Vietnam setting up an art exchange that we hope to transform into a residency. Nine Dot Gallery is the little engine that could, and with your help we can.

My brothers and I opened the doors of Nine Dot Gallery in Worcester, MA in 2015. Our mission was to create a space that would be a real resource in supporting our creative community. Fast-forward to over 50 events, 24 exhibitions, and one relocation later we now share space with the Southeast Asian Coalition of Central Massachusetts. This move ushered a more social justice focus in collaboration with our refugee and immigrant artist and maker community. On The GoTo facilitate more cultural exchange, we have decided to pay it forward. On May 22nd, we will be in Vietnam setting up an art exchange that we hope to transform into a residency. Nine Dot Gallery is the little engine that could, and with your help we can.

<p>Hi, my name is Rajah Caruth. I am a student-athlete and a rising junior at School Without Walls Senior High School in Washington D.C. I run track and play basketball for my school, however my true love is NASCAR and I have always wanted to be a racecar driver. Ever since age 6, I have loved the sport and know everything in and around it. The Pixar movie ‘Cars’ is what got me into the sport, and as the years have gone by, my love and knowledge for NASCAR has grown exponentially. The cars truly mesmerized me, with their sleek bodies and flashy paint schemes. I collected tons of model cars and made custom ones along with homemade tracks.</p> <p>I created a Youtube channel in the summer of 2014 that included stop motion animation videos, music videos, race reactions and reviews. Later that year, I went to my first race, the fall Xfinity Series race at Richmond Raceway on a Friday evening in September. This was especially impactful because I loved this sport for so long, and never had the opportunity to go to a race, since the nearest racetrack was at least an hour’s travel in any direction. It was truly a spectacle; and it just fueled the flame of my dream of making it to the other side of the fence.</p> <p>Following that, I was able to go to multiple Xfinity races at Dover and Pocono, two Truck races (Dover ‘17, Charlotte ‘18), along with the Monster Energy NASCAR 2018 All Star Race. As I got older, I began to realize that the opportunities that are present for me to drive are limited, and that I had to get creative if I wanted to be apart of NASCAR. I took the first steps in 2017 by joining the Autobahn Indoor Speedway summer league in Jessup, MD. I drove very competitively and improved each race I was in.  </p> <p>On June 11th this year, I turned 16 and my desire to have a career in NASCAR has grown even more, especially after attending the 2018 All-Star Race in Charlotte.</p> <p>This summer, I plan to take another step forward in my career by joining the Ignite Series, a NASCAR eleague run on the iRacing simulation program, an online platform which allows me to compete with professional racers around the world and provides a way to be in NASCAR. Participating in this program will allow me to develop my skills, network and provide a possible pathway to become a successful driver similar to those like William Byron, Ty Majeski and other pros who made it to NASCAR through the program.</p> <p>I am asking for your help and support as I try to raise $2000 in order to pay for my iRacing membership, a driving wheel and a basic computer to run the racing program and participate in the 2018 Autobahn Indoor Speedway summer league.</p> <p>Thank you for your support.</p>

<h3>The Festival</h3>
<p>The Future Arts Foundation is expanding the Pearl Street Music &amp; Arts Festival to <strong>A DOZEN VENUES, IN TWO CITIES, OVER FOUR DAYS</strong>! We are renaming the festival because many of the events are now expanding beyond just Pearl Street! Over the next two days, we will be hosting this fundraiser that will not only get the wheels rolling on the festival, but will support youth music and arts programs around Colorado!</p>
<p>Your contribution of $100 will gain you access to the opening night Gala and dinner at Rembrandt Yard Art Gallery in Boulder on April 19th, <strong>AND</strong> a ticket to the main event at the beautiful Macky Auditorium on April 21st!

<h3>Why we're here?</h3>
<p>I love reading and I'd always wanted to have a bookstore. I thought of it as a space where I could do what I liked the most and share my passion with other people. I have worked all my life in the struggle for equal opportunities for women, so, considering that historically for women it has been more difficult to be recognized for their talent, especially in writing, one day I made the decision to create the Bookstore of Women.</p>
<p>More than a dream, <strong>the Bookstore of Women is a way of asserting women authors and their role in society</strong>, and likewise, pushing new women writers. In addition, we believe that by promoting literature and reading, we can contribute to reducing the social gap that women and girls still face.</p>
<p>The Bookstore of Women -The Loom of Words- is a way to combat inequality and contribute to a society that is interested in art, creativity and imagination; it's <strong>a way to contribute to development and build a better society for women and men of all conditions.</strong></p>

<p>I put all my capital to conceive the bookstore. The truth is it hasn't been easy. My friends, other feminist women, have contributed with their resources and have accompanied me throughout this journey, that's why the bookstore is a joint initiative.</p>
<p>But even though we've advanced a lot, we still don't reach the break-even point, besides we also want to continue growing. <strong>We want to have more titles available on our shelves, perform more and new cultural activities, share our learning and receive in our place more women and men who are interested in knowing, enjoying and disseminating literature written by women.</strong></p>
<p>We're being honest; we reach the end of our money, but we still have all the attitude and energy to fight for this cultural and recognition of women authors’ space.</p>
<p>That's why we decided to do this campaign; we need support so that the only Bookstore of Women in Colombia continues to exist.</p>
<p><strong>With your contribution, you will put your bid to contribute to the collective search for a solidary society, with gender equality, justice and peace</strong>; through the promotion of culture, respect and commitment to diversity and recognition of the talent of women writers, thinkers and artists.</p>
<p><i><strong>¿Por qué estamos aquí?</strong></i></p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We have a lot of energy and all our endeavor and commitment so that the Bookstore of Women becomes a space of cultural and artistic reference for women and men.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the first place, we need resources to keep the bookshop alive, while we reach the break-even point (rent, public services, cover debts acquired until now for the bookstore operation, ensure an income for the person in charge of the bookstore...). We must also do a stronger job to make the bookshop known and we need support for that.</li>
<li>It is necessary to have a larger space for the bookstore that allows us to have more books and publications, but above all where we can carry out our cultural and civic activities in an appropriate manner.</li>
<li>We want to have more titles available on our shelves. It requires money to make contracts with new publishing companies, renew the stock more frequently, buy furniture, office supplies, etc.</li>
<li>We are going to establish a permanent cultural program. We have planned workshops, exhibitions, talks, the invitation to more women authors so they can present their work, the publication of a work by the bookstore, built collectively; participation in tradeshows and events to publicize the bookstore...</li>
</ul>
<p>We have determined some financial components that will guarantee the bookstore operation, which will be executed during a fifteen (15) months period:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase, provision and headquarters maintenance fund</li>
<li>Project management and public attention fund</li>
<li>Cultural management fund</li>
<li>Solidarity fund</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don't reach the goal, we will use the money to maintain the bookstore operating as long as we can, while we look for other cooperation and  collective work opportunities for it to grow.</p>

<p><i><strong>¿Qué necesitamos?</strong></i></p>
<p><i>Tenemos mucha energía y todo nuestro empeño y compromiso para que la Librería de Mujeres se convierta en un espacio de referencia cultural y artística para mujeres y hombres.</i></p>
<ul>
<li><i>En primer lugar, necesitamos los recursos para mantener en pie la librería, mientras alcanzamos el punto de equilibrio (arriendo, servicios públicos, cubrir deudas adquiridas hasta ahora para el funcionamiento, asegurar un ingreso económico para la persona que maneja la librería...). También debemos hacer un trabajo más fuerte para dar a conocer la librería y requerimos apoyo para eso.</i></li>
<li><i>Es necesario contar con un espacio más grande para la librería, que nos permita tener más libros y publicaciones, pero sobre todo donde podamos llevar a cabo nuestras actividades culturales y ciudadanas de manera adecuada.</i></li>
<li><i>Queremos tener más títulos disponibles en nuestras estanterías. Se requiere dinero para hacer contratos con nuevas editoriales, renovar el stock con mayor periodicidad, comprar mobiliario y materiales de oficina, etc.</i></li>
<li><i>Vamos a establecer una programación cultural permanente.

</ul>
<p><i>Hemos organizado unos componentes financieros que van a garantizar el funcionamiento de la Librería, para ejecutar durante un periodo de quince (15) meses.</i></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>On the one hand, in Colombia the National Reading Survey (Enlec) has found that the books consumption in the country has increased and that printed books are the format of greatest demand.</p>
<p>However, figures also indicate that of the total of people over 12 surveyed who say they write, only 10.9% write literature, poetry, stories or novels, and it is similar with letters or diaries; comic writing only registers 3.1%. We think that if punctual actions are not carried out to preserve reading and writing, the literature that we know, the one that has preserved our history and culture, would cease to exist.</p>
<p>In addition, we are aware that <strong>in Colombia there are so few actions that recognize and promote the role of arts in social transformation, especially in a country that is just giving itself the opportunity to start over, ending a conflict, trying to build peace.</strong></p>
<p>In Colombia, figures from the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) indicate that women have lower percentages of political participation and employment, but they are the most affected by violence.</p>
<p><strong>If you, like us, believe that through promotion of culture and learning this scenario can change, your support for the bookstore of women in Colombia is crucial</strong>, as a novel alternative to fight for gender equality and a more generous society for women and girls. If women social conditions improve, the whole world will be better.</p>
<p>As the Colombian author Paola Guevara expressed about the women writers, the bookstore wants <strong>women to be ""autonomous, empowered, aware of the power of their voice and with a very strong and well-formed criterion. Supporting each other, admiring each other, feeling sincere emotion for others triumphs; a new form of solidarity that extends to shelter the youngest ones "".</strong></p>

<p><i>Además, somos conscientes de que en Colombia son hasta ahora pocas las acciones que reconozcan y fomenten el papel de las artes en la transformación social, especialmente en un país que apenas se está dando la oportunidad de comenzar de nuevo, finalizando un conflicto, tratando de construir la paz.</i></p>

<p><i>Como la autora colombiana Paola Guevara expresó sobre las escritoras, la librería quiere que las mujeres sean “autónomas, empoderadas, conscientes del poder de su voz y con un criterio muy fuerte y bien formado.

<p><strong>TACT/The Actors Company Theatre</strong> has held a significant position in the Off Broadway Theatre movement for 25 years. Named “Company of the Year” by The Wall Street Journal, and “The Best Company in NYC” by Our Town Press, this award winning company has earned the reputation of being astute theatrical treasure-hunters unearthing and presenting amazing lost, forgotten, or underappreciated plays. Tirelessly searching libraries, estates, and even the desk drawers of famous and now departed writers, TACT’s Artistic Directors and professional resident actors have dedicated themselves to finding the old and making it new again. TACT’s mission has helped spur a movement that has spread throughout the New York theatre community, and now a quarter of a century later, there are many companies carrying the torch.</p>
<p>Having presented roughly 200 rarely seen plays in full productions or readings for audiences in and around New York, TACT is closing its doors, thus ending its production history.</p>
<p><strong>THAT HISTORY MUST BE PRESERVED.</strong></p>
<p>While we cannot preserve the ephemeral magic of performance, we can save its building blocks and records.  We need your help to see that this precious historical material is archived for future generations.   TACT materials to be saved include: dramaturgical research, photos, directors' notes, prompt books, audio recordings, cast lists and bios, original scores and sheet music, and financial records.  The TACT WEBSITE (<a href=""http://tactnyc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.tactnyc.org</a>) alone has almost 700 pages of valuable information, dramaturgical notes, and production photos.  All of this precious history could be invaluable to future theatre-makers, academics, and theatre-lovers – to say nothing of the chronicle it represents of an amazingly lively time in the annals of Off-Broadway and New York City Theatre.</p>
<p>Happily, we have been honored by an invitation to house our physical archives at one of the crown jewels of NYC culture, the New York Public Library for the Performing<br/>Arts (NYPLPA). But all of these unique documents must be scanned and digitized in order for the Library to house them in its database.  In addition, our website needs to be prepared and its future life secured.  All of this costs money.</p>
<p>Time is of the essence.  TACT’s fiscal year ends on June 30 and we hope to complete this and all TACT business by that date.  So we must raise this money in a very short time:  June 1 - June 15.</p>
<p>You can help by donating any amount.  Just use the donate button and you’ll be on your way to helping to preserve NYC Theatre history, not to mention receiving a tax deduction and one of TACT’s unique donor perks.  You’ll also be part of history as TACT will acknowledge your contribution to this project by including your name on our website for as long as it exists.  </p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>CAMPAIGN BUDGET</strong></p>
<p><strong>$4,000 - Material</strong><br/>Archiving, digitizing, preparing and packing materials for the NYPLPA.</p>
<p><strong>$3,500 - Preservation</strong><br/>Maintaining TACT's Website. Preparing the site for the future and updating the navigation. Securing a site custodian and the funds needed to host and maintain the site for the foreseeable future.  </p>
<p><strong>$2,500 - Administrative &amp; other costs</strong><br/>As we archive our history we will be also be closing down the TACT Studio where the materials are currently stored. In addition, there are some legal expenses involved in<br/>closing our non-profit organization.</p>
<p><strong>TOTAL - $10,000</strong></p>

TACT’s mission has helped spur a movement that has spread throughout the New York theatre community, and now a quarter of a century later, there are many companies carrying the torch.
Having presented roughly 200 rarely seen plays in full productions or readings for audiences in and around New York, TACT is closing its doors, thus ending its production history.
THAT HISTORY MUST BE PRESERVED.
While we cannot preserve the ephemeral magic of performance, we can save its building blocks and records.  We need your help to see that this precious historical material is archived for future generations.   TACT materials to be saved include: dramaturgical research, photos, directors' notes, prompt books, audio recordings, cast lists and bios, original scores and sheet music, and financial records.  The TACT WEBSITE (www.tactnyc.org) alone has almost 700 pages of valuable information, dramaturgical notes, and production photos.  All of this precious history could be invaluable to future theatre-makers, academics, and theatre-lovers – to say nothing of the chronicle it represents of an amazingly lively time in the annals of Off-Broadway and New York City Theatre.
Happily, we have been honored by an invitation to house our physical archives at one of the crown jewels of NYC culture, the New York Public Library for the PerformingArts (NYPLPA). But all of these unique documents must be scanned and digitized in order for the Library to house them in its database.  In addition, our website needs to be prepared and its future life secured.  All of this costs money.
Time is of the essence.  TACT’s fiscal year ends on June 30 and we hope to complete this and all TACT business by that date.  So we must raise this money in a very short time:  June 1 - June 15.
You can help by donating any amount.  Just use the donate button and you’ll be on your way to helping to preserve NYC Theatre history, not to mention receiving a tax deduction and one of TACT’s unique donor perks.  You’ll also be part of history as TACT will acknowledge your contribution to this project by including your name on our website for as long as it exists.  
Thank you!

<p>There are as many opinions about Israel and Palestine as there are minds and mouths (and fingers to type a tweet), but here is something everyone can agree on: People in Gaza need more books. </p>
<p>Mosab Abu Toha, a young Gazan with a degree in English literature who has never been able to explore the world due to Israel’s ban on travel, escapes through reading. His friend Shadi Salem volunteered later to help with the establishment of the the library to be the only door that opened for the people of Gaza since they are suffering from many things. First, the library was in a very small place then they launched another campaign last year and they have succeeded to move to a large place. They had many activities inside and out of the library.</p>
<p>Noam Chomsky has donated books to the library project. Here’s what he says about it:</p>
<p>It has been amazing, and inspiring, to see how people surviving in the Gaza prison, subject to constant and vicious attack and living under conditions of brutal deprivation, continue to maintain their dignity and commitment to a better life. Mosab’s initiative to create a library and cultural center in Gaza is an outstanding example of these remarkable efforts. What he is seeking to achieve would make a very significant contribution to enriching the lives of Gazans and providing them with opportunities for a much better future.  It merits strong support from everyone concerned with justice and basic human rights.</p>
<p>If you care about Israel, Palestine, Gaza, education, reading, books, stretching the imagination through encounters with the imaginations of others, or encouraging people who are trying to make the world a better place even in extremely discouraging circumstances, please give to the project and circulate this information to your friends and lists.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The funds we need from January 2019 till January 2020 are:</p>
<p>3500 USD for renting a bigger apartment.</p>
<p>Two employees with a salary of 300 USD each (600 USD X 12 = 7200 USD)</p>
<p>A servant for deliveries and staying in the library in time of out-door activities: 100 a month (100 X 12= 1200 USD)</p>
<p>Operating costs (100 USD each month= 1200 USD)</p>
<p>More Shelves for the more books we get and tables and chairs (Estimated: 1700 USD)</p>
<p> Another LCD screen 550 USD</p>
<p>UPS device 450 USD</p>

<h3>Southwest Chief Bicycle &amp; Comedy Festival</h3>
<p>Known as <strong>La Puerta De Colorado</strong>, Trinidad, CO is an emerging mountain town steeped in natural and architectural beauty. A traditional stop along the Santa Fe Trail, the once booming coal city has a long and colorful history. These features alone make it an ideal local to host modern day festival crowds, but what makes Trinidad so unique is it's position along <strong>Amtrak's Southwest Chief Passenger</strong> line and <strong>Interstate 25</strong>. A one-of-a-kind crossroads; sitting both halfway between the legendary comedy and improv city of <strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong> and the global film and entertainment mecca of <strong>Los Angeles, California</strong> and only a few hours drive south of the top mid-sized comedy city in the county,<strong> Denver, Colorado</strong> and a few hours north of <strong>New Mexico</strong>'s thriving film and art community. There is no other place quite like it.</p>
<p><strong>Wally Wallace LLC</strong>, is partnering with <strong>Bigtop Studios, Birdy Magazine</strong> and a number of businesses throughout Trinidad, Colorado and across the nation, to produce the <strong>First Annual Southwest Chief Bicycle &amp; Comedy Festival</strong> happening <strong>Thursday May 2 – Sunday May 5, 2019</strong> in bars, venues, and intimate spaces throughout <strong>Trinidad, Colorado's Downtown District</strong>.</p>
<p>This festival offers a fun and <strong>unique travel excursion for comedy enthusiasts</strong> of all ages while offering <strong>development opportunities for Trinidad and Southern Colorado</strong>. For IndieGogo supporters and ticket buyers, we offer a one-of-a-kind comedy experience, while working with local businesses to fill their hotel, bars, restaurants and stores. <strong>By doing this we are greatly supporting a small, localized economy simply by taking a vacation that offers a whole lot of laughs at a very reasonable price!</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Buy Your Tickets Now and Get Them Discounted!</h3>
<p>We have contributed the initial funds to get this festival going but are seeking sponsorship and community support (through pre-ticket sales)  to make this festival all it can be. Transportation and lodging costs have been covered, but additional funds will allow us to increase our budget for the following costs  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>TALENT: </strong>The more tickets we have sold, the bigger our talent budget becomes! We've got some amazing connections in the national comedy community, which have afforded us the opportunity to get some incredible talent involved with this project. However, friendships don't pay the bills!  Help us raise some more funds to offer some top quality performers the compensation they deserve. </li>
<li>
<strong>Marketing:</strong> With built in partnerships with radio stations, publications, and comedy networks throughout Colorado and beyond, Southwest Chief Festivals has a wide reach for marketing. Combined with the staff's extensive experience in social media and online promotions the potential of the marketing campaign are enormous, but the addition of your financial support, we will make financial contributions to our many media partners to help spread word about the festival, and to financially support these essential local media organizations.</li>
<li>
<strong>Bicycles: </strong>An essential part of this festivals is BICYCLES!  We have partnered with Rubberside Down Cyclery to bring down 10 pedicabs to transport festival attendees to transport comedians and audience members from the train station, to hotels, venues and beyond.  This service is not free though!  Help us raise the funds needed to bring these pedi-cabs (and additional bicycling resources) to Trinidad for the festival! </li>
<li>
<strong>Staffing:</strong> The Southwest Chief Bicycle &amp; Comedy Festival has a small and dedicated staff of four individuals. They have extensive experience, and knowledge on festival and event management, but the addition of more funds for additional staff support would benefit this festival massively.</li>
</ul>
<p>Show your support now, help us increase out budget for these costs, and get your tickets at a lower cost WITH A FREE T-SHIRT!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Yes, the Southwest Chief Bicycle Comedy &amp; Bicycle Festival sounds like an amazing weekend of laughs, bicycling and memories, but your support means a lot more than that. </p>
<ul>
<li>Assist in the cultural and economic development of a emerging former-mining town.</li>
<li>25% of all profits will be donated to charity causes that support; Native American tribal organizations, GLBTQ causes, rail passenger associations, cycling initiatives, and affordable housing initiatives. </li>
<li>Make the first Southwest Chief Bicycle &amp; Comedy Festival a success so that we can justify making it an annual event!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest risk that we face as we establish the Southwest Chief Bicycle &amp; Comedy Festival is the chance that people won't purchase tickets and/or show up for the fest!  We've put in the initial costs for transportation and housing of comedians and will throw the event regardless of expected turnout, but the success of this festival is truly dependent on your ability to become a part of it!

</div></div>","Lake Erie Folk Fest Celebrates Five Years
This February 21-22, the Lake Erie Folk Fest will once again bring together music lovers from across Northeast Ohio for a mid-winter celebration of traditional music and dance.
The Lake Erie Folk Fest (LEFF) is a warm community gathering in the cold of winter; a celebration of diverse traditions; a gathering of musicians young and old, experienced and novice. In short, the festival inspires and fosters traditional music in Northeast Ohio.
Passing It On
The Lake Erie Folk Fest is dedicated to ensuring that traditional music and dance is passed on to newcomers and to new generations. To accomplish this, the festival offers:

a school program for area students
an amazing array of free music workshops, jams, dances and performances
an affordable evening concert
and this year, master classes for intermediate to advanced bluegrass musicians

We Need Your Support
LEFF depends on donations, large and small, from generous individuals such as yourself.  Dollars raised from this campaign represents just a portion of festival costs, the largest of which is artists fees.

<p><strong>TranszFeszt Budapest 2019. március 29-31</strong></p>
<p>Magyarország, és valószínűleg az egész régió <strong>első transz tematikájú fesztiválja</strong> 2014-ben került megrendezésre. Majdnem öt évet kellett várnunk rá, hogy újra megszervezhessük.</p>
<p>Reményeink szerint hagyományteremtő módon a <strong>Transznemű láthatóság nemzetközi napja</strong> köré időzítettük az eseményt, idén <strong>március 31-</strong>én zárul a fesztivál.  </p>
<p>Egyik fő célunk, hogy felhívjuk a figyelmet azokra a kérdésekre melyek <strong>transz, nem-bináris illetve dzsender-nonkonform emberekként foglalkoztatnak minket</strong> ma Magyarországon. Különösen fontos számunkra, hogy <strong>teret biztosítsunk transz</strong> <strong>vezetők és művészek számára</strong>.</p>
<p>Az országban, és a közösségünkben tapasztalható rossz anyagi körülményeket figyelembe véve szeretnénk a fesztivált a lehető leginkluzívabbá tenni azzal is, hogy <strong>minden esemény ingyenes lesz.</strong></p>
<p>Támogasd a szervezőket, hogy a magyar transz közösség méltó módon ünnepelhessen!</p>

<p>Az adományokat terembérlésre, útiköltségre, programfüzetre és a megnyitó egyéb költségeire fordítjuk.</p>
<p><strong>Milyen kihívásokkal nézünk szembe?</strong></p>
<p>Ingyenes eseményként a fesztivált<strong> teljes mértékben nagylelkű adományozók és olyan támogatók teszik lehetővé</strong> akik a közösségünket növekedni és erősödni szeretnék látni. <br/>Az adományod ahhoz járul hozzá, hogy <strong>többféle programot</strong> valósíthassunk meg még hatákonyabban.</p>
<p><strong>Hogyan segíthetsz még?</strong></p>

<h3>What is Juicebox</h3>
<p>Juicebox is a variety of intimate femxle events focused on promoting self love, liberation, exploration, empowerment, education and creating a compassionate community.  Watch the video above for more info! Events are multifold and in the past have included yoni gazing, cabin get-aways, 6-course dinner parties and creative workshops on self love. Our members include people who identify as: female, transgender and non-binary. We do not discriminate against color, body shape or how many wrinkles one has, we appreciate that everyone is different and is uniquely beautiful. We are based in Norway, but see the demand for these events and community throughout the world so we plan to expand across borders within 5 years. </p>
<p>Right now we are asking for your help to take Juicebox to the next level with creating this event and community application. Our goal with Juicebox is to empower womxn and create a better community for us all. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Juicebox App</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Why an app? Because todays facebook group algorthims makes it very hard for us to reach out to our members. The goal with this app (and website) is to make it easier to find future events, buy tickets, find information about juicebox, testimonials and education. However our main focus with is app is to build a community platform including profiles and chat forms in order to connect with each other in a safe space with like minded people. </p>
<p>In the making of this App we are supporting a small female dominated app developer agency in Bergen by the name Svippin. The cost of creating this app is 400 000,- NOK (+ 12 000 Idiegogo fees) and will take up to four months to create. The start date for development is 22nd of Feburary 2021, all contributions exceeding the crowdfunding goal will be used to develop free and cheaper events for  our members. In the case we unfortunately do not achieve the crowdfunding goal we have a few back-up plans to make sure the development of the app prevails, however the more help we get the easier it is for us to achieve our ambition, that is why every donation counts.</p>
<p>Please consider making a donation today and know that the entirety of your generous gift will empower femxls to be themselves, grow their self-esteem, become more equal and create a society that is more open, compassionate and has stronger cohesion.</p>
<p>It is possible to donate whatever amount you feel like -&gt; Look for the pink button ""BACK IT"".  Thank you! </p>

<h3>Where we are</h3>
<p>I was working on my PhD in Biochemistry &amp; Biophysics when I started #BLACKandSTEM, which showed the need for community for Black STEM students, educators, and professionals in an unprecedented way - reflected by our recognition in outlets such as Fast Company, NPR, and B*tch Magazine. With almost 6 years of continued work to support the #BLACKandSTEM community (that has grown into the thousands) and that includes advocacy at the federal level, I look to our supporters for help.</p>
<p>For the past 6 years, I have used my own funds and time to keep the community going, and there is more that I want to do. To expand available resources, I am looking to complete business registration and trademarking and continue revamping of our website.</p>

<h3>What we need</h3>
<p>I am starting the campaign with a goal of raising $1000 to support business registration and trademarking including legal fees. Funds raised in excess of the costs of registration and trademarking will be prioritized toward paying for website registration and hosting.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal, all funds will go toward supporting business registration and trademarking.</p>

<h3>#BLACKandSTEM's impact...</h3>Has been demonstrated time and again over the years. We work with several organizations in demanding diversity, equity, and inclusion that is effective and felt by those historically marginalized in education and STEM areas.

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Let's make Magical happen! <strong>17-20 August 2018</strong> in a beautiful location in West Sussex.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503149093/pqmjapzbaav7rooovmmj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We are Team Magical: Zoë, Yoshi, Yello, Hannah &amp; Adam, and we think life is totally AMAZING! Each and every person you meet has wonderfully unique qualities, and everyone has something valuable to contribute to the world.</p>
<p>But society is not set up to help you believe this or fulfil your true potential. 'They' basically tell you that you're not good enough as you are, and need to buy stuff to make you happy! We think… NO! You are already the mutt’s nuts!</p>
<p>That’s why we’ve set up Magical - a small, boutique festival where you can be the BEST you, free from the pressures of modern society that hold you back. A place to embrace your weirdness and celebrate your quirkiness! To us, being yourself is literally the most important thing in the world, and in our opinion is the only route to true happiness, fulfilment, ridiculousness and joy! It’s literally where the magic happens!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503220810/z2pqwrnkw9sthwgjer43.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">We ran a pilot festival in 2016 with the intention to inspire guests to be the best versions of themselves; to be social, creative and celebrate life. The feedback was incredible - everyone danced like there was no tomorrow, and most importantly we helped people get a little bit closer to their true selves and to each other. Bingo! It worked!</span></p>
<p>Now we want to bring Magical to the public, so everyone can experience our life-changing event. With a 1,000 person capacity, Magical 2018 will be bigger, better and even more beautiful... but WE NEED YOUR HELP to make it happen!</p>
<p>Even more important than your financial support, we need you to bring your positivity and open mind to the festival.  This contribution is priceless!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503153842/sndlv680aeiifkqvdjx3.jpg"" src=""""/><br/> </p>

<p>We’re raising £30,000 to get this amazing project off the ground, which is around 50% of the cost to run the event. As you can see, it costs quite a few pennies to run a festival!</p>
<p>This would be enough to get the ball rolling for Magical 2018, putting down deposits for the infrastructure such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our beautiful venue in Sussex</li>
<li>The main stage and additional tents</li>
<li>Boring behind-the-scenes stuff like generators and fencing</li>
<li>All the essentials, such as toilets &amp; showers (posh ones, obvs!)</li>
</ul>
<p>And of course booking all the things that make Magical special:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bands &amp; DJs to make you dance your socks off!</li>
<li>A plethora of inspirational speakers &amp; interactive workshops</li>
<li>Decorations and lighting that will make the place sparkle!</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve provisionally booked some top class artists, so The Correspondents, Plump DJs and Carnival Collective (+ more!) will be playing at Magical 2018 if the crowdfunding target is met!</p>
<p><strong>WHAT HAPPENS IF WE DON'T REACH OUR TARGET?</strong><br/>If we don't reach the £30,000 goal by the deadline, THE FESTIVAL WON'T HAPPEN. This opportunity to do so much good will be lost and your money will be returned to you in full.</p>
<p>But imagine if we DO reach our target. You’ll be responsible for making the world a bit more magical by helping to launch this festival! Join the community - back the project today.<br/> </p>

</div></div>","Let's make Magical happen! 17-20 August 2018 in a beautiful location in West Sussex.

We are Team Magical: Zoë, Yoshi, Yello, Hannah & Adam, and we think life is totally AMAZING! Each and every person you meet has wonderfully unique qualities, and everyone has something valuable to contribute to the world.
But society is not set up to help you believe this or fulfil your true potential. 'They' basically tell you that you're not good enough as you are, and need to buy stuff to make you happy! We think… NO! You are already the mutt’s nuts!
That’s why we’ve set up Magical - a small, boutique festival where you can be the BEST you, free from the pressures of modern society that hold you back. A place to embrace your weirdness and celebrate your quirkiness! To us, being yourself is literally the most important thing in the world, and in our opinion is the only route to true happiness, fulfilment, ridiculousness and joy! It’s literally where the magic happens!

We ran a pilot festival in 2016 with the intention to inspire guests to be the best versions of themselves; to be social, creative and celebrate life. The feedback was incredible - everyone danced like there was no tomorrow, and most importantly we helped people get a little bit closer to their true selves and to each other. Bingo! It worked!
Now we want to bring Magical to the public, so everyone can experience our life-changing event. With a 1,000 person capacity, Magical 2018 will be bigger, better and even more beautiful... but WE NEED YOUR HELP to make it happen!
Even more important than your financial support, we need you to bring your positivity and open mind to the festival.  This contribution is priceless!
 


We’re raising £30,000 to get this amazing project off the ground, which is around 50% of the cost to run the event. As you can see, it costs quite a few pennies to run a festival!
This would be enough to get the ball rolling for Magical 2018, putting down deposits for the infrastructure such as:

Our beautiful venue in Sussex
The main stage and additional tents
Boring behind-the-scenes stuff like generators and fencing
All the essentials, such as toilets & showers (posh ones, obvs!)

And of course booking all the things that make Magical special:

Bands & DJs to make you dance your socks off!
A plethora of inspirational speakers & interactive workshops
Decorations and lighting that will make the place sparkle!

We’ve provisionally booked some top class artists, so The Correspondents, Plump DJs and Carnival Collective (+ more!) will be playing at Magical 2018 if the crowdfunding target is met!
WHAT HAPPENS IF WE DON'T REACH OUR TARGET?If we don't reach the £30,000 goal by the deadline, THE FESTIVAL WON'T HAPPEN. This opportunity to do so much good will be lost and your money will be returned to you in full.
But imagine if we DO reach our target. You’ll be responsible for making the world a bit more magical by helping to launch this festival! Join the community - back the project today. 





 BOUTIQUE VOUCHERSIf the crowdfunding target is met, boutique camping will be available to book in early 2018. We’re offering crowdfunding backers special packages with Boutique Vouchers that give you £100 discount on a lovely Bell Tent! Note: only 1 voucher can be used per bell tent.

<p>Venetian culture, heretofore, has been nearly invisible within the significant cultural event of the Venice Biennale. If the Venetian community is enabled to participate as a constituent, rather than as spectator, in the Venice Biennale of Architecture 2018, it would give visibility to the tremendous efforts of the Venetian community to save besieged Venetian culture. There are architectural and structural challenges confronting the scole sites that are inherent to the well-documented risks imperiling Venice, including lack of financial resources, competing interests, fractured governance, native depopulation, and environmental hazards.</p>
<p>In 2014, Milestone Architecture PLLC worked on Torcello, an island in the Venetian lagoon, drawing attention to its importance as a global heritage site. We recently published a book, entitled <i>Restoration Initiative: Torcello-Venezia, Italia</i>, about Torcello's history and our architectural survey process. Using 3D digital laser-scanning technology, we were able to report extremely accurate images of the structures, including the seventh-century Basilica of Santa Maria Assunta, the twelfth-century Martyrium of Santa Fosca and the Campanile.</p>
<p>A key feature of our Torcello project was its ""human-centered design"", its accessibility for youth, the elderly, and the disabled. Working with an accomplished team of researchers, we developed methods for elevating the tactile nature of exhibit elements, in order to increase the way in which we could inform and educate exhibit visitor.</p>

In the spirit of the planners of Venice, our project, Dimensions: Two Venetian Scole, aims to utilize cutting edge architectural survey technology in an effort to conserve the current state of vital landmarks in the city’s built environment. Using 3D laser-scanning, extremely accurate images of the structures including Scola de Cristo & Scola dei Merchant, will be captured, refined and made public. 

 
By doing so, we will elaborate the historical aspects of the artworks and structures, as well as aim to reconstruct the original artworks and functions present in the buildings. In addition, we will exhibit contemporary digital art (which is shown here in our video) in the historic structure as a reminder of the timeless and fluid nature of culture. 

The project also acts as means of giving agency to the local population to catalyze future conservation and artistic projects at their discretion.
 



 


Venetian culture, heretofore, has been nearly invisible within the significant cultural event of the Venice Biennale. If the Venetian community is enabled to participate as a constituent, rather than as spectator, in the Venice Biennale of Architecture 2018, it would give visibility to the tremendous efforts of the Venetian community to save besieged Venetian culture. There are architectural and structural challenges confronting the scole sites that are inherent to the well-documented risks imperiling Venice, including lack of financial resources, competing interests, fractured governance, native depopulation, and environmental hazards.
In 2014, Milestone Architecture PLLC worked on Torcello, an island in the Venetian lagoon, drawing attention to its importance as a global heritage site. We recently published a book, entitled Restoration Initiative: Torcello-Venezia, Italia, about Torcello's history and our architectural survey process. Using 3D digital laser-scanning technology, we were able to report extremely accurate images of the structures, including the seventh-century Basilica of Santa Maria Assunta, the twelfth-century Martyrium of Santa Fosca and the Campanile.
A key feature of our Torcello project was its ""human-centered design"", its accessibility for youth, the elderly, and the disabled. Working with an accomplished team of researchers, we developed methods for elevating the tactile nature of exhibit elements, in order to increase the way in which we could inform and educate exhibit visitor.

</div></div>","Summary
The creation of a book that explores the thoughts and experiences of some of the Puerto Rican kids who triumphed over one of the world’s most vicious natural disasters.

The work
#1
Work directly with the youth of Puerto Rico to create an account of life before, during and after Hurricane Maria through the eyes of a child.  Writing workshops will be held at select locations on The Island 1x per month for six months. A qualified Social Worker will be at each workshop to help the youth cope with some of the strong feelings they may have.
#2
A publisher is in place who has already agreed to publish the finished work and allproceeds from the book will go towards select youth organizations in Puerto Rico.
#3
The books will be made available free of charge to all of the youth of Puerto Rico.
#4
This book will be an innocent and honest interpretation of their fear, pain, loss, anger, hopelessness and ultimately triumph. It will serve as a release valve for both, the youth who participate and those who read it. 
#5
Through this project we hope to introduce these beautiful children to the writer in their hearts, so they may continue to tell their stories.

<p>Studio Current is Seattle’s artist run culture creating subterranean laboratory located in the heart of the Pike/Pine corridor of the Capitol Hill neighborhood - and yes darlings - we are headed into the <u>fifth year</u> in our <i>current</i> incarnation! So many of you have been a big part of this journey coming to shows and workshops, as artists in residence, as volunteers, as performers, rehearsing, creating, and living something of the art life within our walls. Thank you. It’s literally what we’re here for and it’s such an honor to provide the kind of support you let us know you need. </p>
<p>SC is <u>volunteer run</u> by a group of queer artists who believe in the mission: to support participation in the arts. We are:</p>
<p>Laura Aschoff - director of internal operations</p>
<p>Angelina Baldoz - director of communications</p>
<p>Renee Shure - media manager</p>
<p>Markeith Wiley - director of development and productions</p>
<p>Katherine Cohen - artistic director</p>
<p>Part of why we’re fundraising is with the hope that we can start paying these fine folks for their efforts! Everything else goes toward bills and rent.</p>
<p>We’re a micro organization operating on a shoestring budget but we’ve grown into a hub for experimental and underground arts. The services Studio Current provides are in high demand. But as SC grows, the workload on our volunteer directors does too, and we’ve hit a point where our funding doesn’t match the energy output and expenses needed to meet the demands of our community utilizing the space. </p>
<p>So, we need to raise this money to keep going another year. The good news is:</p>
<p><i>We have a unique opportunity thanks to a few generous supporters</i> <b><u>to quadruple every dollar donated to this campaign. </u></b></p>
<p><b><u>That’s right, for every one dollar donated by you here SC will receive $4.</u></b> It’s super powerful amplification and this gift couldn’t have come at a better time.</p>
<p>That means if (((you))) can help us reach the goal of 10K here, Studio Current can continue through all of 2020! </p>
<p>So, one more time because this is amazing: </p>
<p>You donate $20.</p>
<p>It gets quadrupled.</p>
<p>You’ve made it possible for SC to receive $80 with your $20 donation</p>
<p>And there are some cute offerings of gratitude for your support here: tiny videos, stickers, pencils, tshirts, festival and series passes, and maybe a few pop ups along the way.</p>
<p>If we don’t reach the 10K goal here we’ll keep going &amp; exploring the options as long as we have the resources to do so.  SC directors have gotten really good at making things stretch and filling in the gaps ourselves, but we’re at a make or break point. </p>

<p>Access to art events, access to space and support for artists, and a priority of support for experimentation is what SC is all about. The energy here is amazing and it’s absolutely because of the way artists can and do use the space, and how audiences are invited to be here. We’d love to keep it going another year and it looks like we have a fighting chance for 2020!</p>
<p>***If you can donate money - great! There may have never been a better time to do it at any dollar amount!! It’s so incredibly helpful and appreciated!</p>

<li value=""NaN"">To provide Yes groups with campaigning materials on the ground in order to increase support for independence above the 50% mark.</li>
</ol>
<p>Why you should support it?</p>
<p>First of all, you get a nice perk - <strong>a Yes flag with a brand new design</strong> (see above). But beyond that, you are helping the Yes groups to raise <i>even more</i> funds so that they are ready for #indyref2. To that end, the <strong>Scottish Independence Foundation</strong> have agreed to support the project and are match-funding the first £8,000! This is an enormous boost and will enable us to provide Yes groups with a lot more materials than a single crowdfunder could provide alone.</p>
<p>While the <i>exact</i> contents of the kit will depend on (to the penny) how much money we raise, this is the provisional contents list <strong>for each Kit </strong>that we are currently working towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>35 x Yes flags with a new design</li>
<li>50 x Car window Stickers with a new Yes design</li>
<li>500 x Yes stickers on A4 sheets</li>
<li>1,000 x A5 leaflets on pensions</li>
<li>1,000 x A5 leaflets on currency</li>
<li>1,000 x A5 leaflets on the economy</li>
<li>1,000 x A5 leaflets on inequality in the UK</li>
</ul>
<p>The leaflets are suggested topics at the moment. We will take these to the <strong>National Yes Registry's Gathering </strong>in October and work with the Yes groups represented there to democratically decide as a  grassroots movement which messages are most important to get across to voters on the the ground.</p>
<p>We'll also be seeking 3rd-party content from other pro-indy organisations to add to the Kit's contents.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>This sounds familiar...</h3>
<p>It should - we've done it before. The original Indy Kit was developed in 2016 and we delivered 150 of them to Yes groups. It was wildly successful and to this day we still get Yes groups asking when we're going to do another one! It was this proven track record which convinced the Scottish Independence Foundation to back us. So you see, we know that this works, and we know that we can deliver.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The target</h3>
<p>The target is <strong>£12,500</strong>. Along with SIF's £8,000 contribution, this will enable us to buy:</p>
<ul>
<li>8,000 New Yes flags</li>
<li>10,000 Car window stickers</li>
<li>100,000 Weatherproof 50mm Yes stickers</li>
<li>800,000 Pro-independence leaflets</li>
</ul>
<p>...split across 200 individually packed Kits. If we exceed the target and are very careful with the budget, we might even be able to stretch that to <i>one million </i>leaflets. <strong>Imagine what the Yes movement could do with one million carefully targeted leaflets on the streets of Scotland!</strong></p>
<p>Even better - if the Yes groups are able to sell all of the Kit's contents at the prices which we suggest, it will raise<strong> £775</strong> for them to use on their own projects. That's £775 <i>per Kit</i>, and we're going to produce 200 of them. That means, for your £12,500 in donations, we could potentially return <strong>£155,000 to </strong>Yes groups across Scotland. That's one heck of a return on investment!</p>
<p>If 500 people donate £25 each, we would make target and we can set the ball rolling on indyref2. That seems eminently acheiveable.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>When do we deliver?</h3>
<p>The flags are made in China (like almost everything these days), and they will take about 10 weeks to arrive via container ship. so we will be sending out all of the donation perks in the middle of October with the final completed Kits available to all Yes groups at the end of October.</p>
<p>Distribution will be via the National Yes Registry's IndyApp, and Yes groups will be asked to pay a small fee per kit (probably around £30 apiece) to cover the costs of packaging materials and courier delivery (each kit will likely weight in excess of 25Kg).</p>
<p> </p>
</div></div>","The short version
Help to fund the creation of 200 ""Indy Kits"" to be distributed to Yes groups all over Scotland. The Kits will contain pro-independence flags, stickers, and thousands of leaflets for grassroots distribution to help convince voters that Scotland will be better off by taking our destiny into our own hands.
 

The slightly longer version
The purpose of this project is two-fold;

To provide Yes groups with merchandise (flags and stickers) which they can sell on to raise funds for their own activities, and;
To provide Yes groups with campaigning materials on the ground in order to increase support for independence above the 50% mark.

Why you should support it?

In addition, it aims to highlight Japanese women’s wrestling, world leader when it comes to train formidable athletes.The show has been confirmed for Saturday 9th November 2019 at Shopping Center “Città Fiera” of Torreano di Martignacco (province of Udine), in the north-east of Italy. The show will be free entrance and will take place within “Città Fiera Comic Convention”, an important event dedicated to comics, videogames, cosplay and other elements of Japanese pop culture.The wrestling show will be made in collaboration with ""Bologna Wrestling Team"", one of the leading wrestling groups in Italy.Event: Rising SlamDate: November 9th, 2019 (Sat.)Venue: Centro Commerciale ""Città Fiera"", Via Antonio Bardelli 4, Torreano di Martignacco (UD), 33035 Italy. (Shopping center is around 10 minutes by car from Udine, the biggest city in the area, or 20 minutes by bus -Line N°9-, that stops right in front of the building)Show start: around 16:00(image taken from 2016's wrestling show in the same structure, featuring 2 Japanese guests)We believe it is very important that the unique style of Japanese wrestling gets more chances of being seen live also in Europe not only through individual athletes, but rather through a larger group.Thanks to Your support this dream may become reality, building an event made by wrestling fans for wrestling fans. Furthermore, with the positive outcome of this event, we will be able to open the way for a greater interaction between Japan and Europe also in the extraordinary and unique world of professional wrestling. WHAT WE NEEDBeing free for the audience, the event needs funds in order to pay the expenses  for athletes who will perform there. Among these expenses are included things such as gallery, accommodation, transports and meals. Campaign’s goal is to gather €8.000 in order to cover the remaining expenses and thus allow the success of the show both for the audience and for the athletes, who are really looking forward to the chance of testing themselves in front of foreign fans.Among the names invited to participate in this unique event there are 8 female athletes from Japan:- Makoto (freelancer), nicknamed “Oriental Doll”, is the athlete with the most experience in the group thanks to Her 13 years of activity.- Tsukushi from Ice Ribbon, little but fearsome athlete who hides evil tricks behind Her apparent innocence.- Tequila Saya from Ice Ribbon, with Her first (and last) expedition abroad, will retire on December 31th. Don't miss the chance to see this wonderful lady wrestling in Europe!- Rina Yamashita (freelancer), surely the most powerful among the wrestlers involved, during matches She’s like a human wrecking ball.- Tae Honma (AWG Beginning), a bright person and fearless fighter, She uses strategy and technique to get the better of opponents.- SAKI (AWG Color's), a true leader with great charisma, during matches Her fighting style is very ""wild"".- Mari (AWG Color's), a real ninja with unlimited resources, She combines technique, athleticism and lethal kicks.- Misa Matsui (AWG Color's), exuberant and talented girl, at only 19 years old She’s the youngest of the group.WHAT YOU WILL GETIf You have the chance to attend the show live, but even if it will be impossible, Your support will be rewarded! Thanks to the kind help of the athletes involved in the event, we thought about many perks to offer to our supporters.- Postcards: designed with a unique manga style, postcards will be in 8 different versions representing every wrestler called for this show.- Signed Portraits: portraits 21x29,7cm (A4) in limited edition available only for this campaign and representing the athletes involved in the show.- T-Shirt: celebrating the largest “Joshi” expedition ever realized in Italy, this T-Shirt is designed by Mari.- Art Work: special poster designed by Nagatoshi Sakai, official illustrator of New Japan Pro Wrestling.- Signed Poster: poster of the event with all participants’ signs on it.- DVD: video of the show.- Photobook: photo album of the event with comments from guests about their experience in Italy.- Dinner: exclusive dinner with wrestlers on the event’s day (limited to people who will be in attendance). WHAT IF WE DO NOT REACH THE GOAL?The show will happen even if our goal won’t be reached, however there is  the risk of having to cut part of the guests due to the lack of budget. WHAT THIS SHOW MEANSWrestling is part of the Japanese culture nowadays, gathering people of any type and age inside arenas or even outdoor to witness a unique spectacle. Anyone who has been to a wrestling show in Japan can understand how special and meaningful it is and, despite it is impossible to perfectly simulate that atmosphere, one of the aims of this event is to recreate at least partially the effect of a Japanese wrestling show. IS IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SUPPORT US?Sure, it is not always possible to offer a contribution.

Sen under under 2019 drog JES drygt 3500 gäster och hittills under 2020 har ca 750 gäster. Syftet med projektet var att lyfta fram mörka delar av vår lokalhistoria.Att höra historien om vad som hänt, på plats där det hände. Framför allt för att göra människor medvetna om denna viktiga historia i deras närhet. Skapa ett historieintresse, som man gör enklast genom att just belysa mörka, skrämmande delar av historien. Men också för att förhoppningsvis, med utgångspunkt från historien, skapa en sundare människosyn i nutid. Vi höll historiska vandringar på mentalsjukhuset S:t Lars i Lund under hela året och sen september höll vi även historiska vandringar på mentalsjukhuset Vipeholm. Under 2020 kommer vi att utveckla JES ytterligare.Vi fortsatte ha en ny, djupare beskrivning av historien kring  S:t Lars, med fler enskilda livsöden, i S:t Lars del 2. I kombination med fika. Vi kommer att fortsätta med denna och våra vandringar på S:t Lars och Vipeholm. Vi planerar också att fortsätta våra historiska vandringar med historier om avrättningsplatser i Skåne, samt bödelsyrket med planerad uppstart i höst.   Dessutom planerar vi också att berätta historien kring massakern vid Klågerup år 1811. Även detta med planerad start i höstDet finns också planer på att i framtiden vidareutveckla JES utanför Skånes gränser och bliJämmer och Elände i Sverige. Kanske  samband med våra historier kring bödelsyrket. För att kunna fortsätta utveckla detta projekt, behöver vi nu ert stöd. Ta del av våra erbjudanden och hjälp oss göra JES ännu större och nå ut till ännu fler.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns
