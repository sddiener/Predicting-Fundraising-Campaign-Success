<h3>Short Summary</h3>
To all of those who don’t know me personally, <br/><br/>    Let me start by introducing myself.  My name is José Artemio Rodríguez García.  I graduated from Aurora University, in Illinois, during the summer of 2010 with a Bachelors in Arts in the field of English.  For two years I have pondered about what I want to do with my life and writing has always secretly haunted my thoughts.  I guess I was afraid to take the path of the writer because it is not a lucrative one, and I, like many people nowadays, have been taught that a decent job and sufficient money is essential to survival.  I have decided to begin my career as a writer no matter how grave the struggle might be.  I just need a little help from friends and family, and those who might stumble across my campaign.   <br/><br/>    A journey through the backroads of Mexico to find inspiration that will allow me to complete literary works already in progress.  I plan on traveling the often dangerous roads of Mexico, rather than taking the more secure tollway, to reach the less touristic towns and places in Mexico to meet their people and take in the sites.  Hopefully all this will translate into my writings and my readers will be able to live my experiences vicariously.  During this journey I will write essays and creative pieces and hopefully compile a complete philosophical work in the style of Walden by Henry David Thoreau - this is my greatest goal as a writer.  It will probably take me more than a year to complete something of this magnitude, but I also have a short term goal.  This summer I will publish two series of short stories and poems in English and Spanish.  That will be my debut as a writer.  Did I mention I will do this barefoot?<br/><br/>    Contributions made will allow me to travel to Mexico where I will find shelter in the homes of relatives and friends, and away from the pressure of living in the U.S.. I will then be able to start my career as a writer.  You might think that I am trying to escape the stress from having a normal job here in the States, but this is not the case.  Writing is a full time job.  I will not always be sheltered.  In fact, I plan on traveling modestly with little or no comforts.  A wise chinese man once told me (mind you, he was actually an English professor of mine but he was also chinese and elder), “great writing often comes easily to the starving writer.”  This campaign will allow me to reach my country of destiny, and it is more of a thrust into my adventures as a writer than it is a funding of my whole travels.  Once in Mexico, I will find the means to travel by the most economic means, as I intend to be less materialistic in my life and more efficient in my existence on this planet.  Please note, that if my campaign raises more than what I have set as a goal I will find that every penny of it goes towards people who need it.</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
I need only 5,000 dollars.  I have traveled from Chicago to Mexico by car in the past and 500 dollars worth of gas and tolls usually gets me to Durango, Mexico.  However, this time around I will only take the freeway, a bit more risky but it will surely make for a great adventure.  I estimate that from Santa Clara, California, and with current gas prices it will be around 400 dollars to reach Durango.  While I am in Mexico I will have no assurance of funding to pay my student loan, car loan, credit card, and phone bill while I am out of the country so I am also calculating all this bills into the 5,000 dollars.  For the three months I plan on being south of the boarder I will need a total of around 2,000 dollars.  That will leave me with 2,600 dollars to travel all through out Mexico for three months paying for gas, food, and any other hidden expenses, most likely in the form of bribes.  It is not a lot of money for the type of journey I will make, but this will only make my journey more interesting.  <br/><br/>    Nobody expects to give with out receiving something in return.  So let us talk about the perks.  A 25 dollar contribution will get your name mentioned in my travel log on my WordPress, Blogger, and Facebook accounts under the Mecenas de las Artes / Patron of the Arts log.  I will include these addresses underneath.  A 50 dollar contribution will get your name mentioned in my publication of short stories and poems that I will compile over the summer and send to publish over the fall, and you will also get the first perk.  A 100 dollar contribution will get you not only perks one and two but also a signed copy of the publication once it is completed - note that I plan on only publishing a very limited amount of hard copies as I would prefer my readers to enjoy my writings on electronic books in an effort to be more environmentally conscious.  If you are one of the few that rarely receives gifts for christmas, you can expect to get one from me.  <br/><br/>    I just want to make it clear that if I do not reach my goal of 5,000 dollars all the contributions will be returned to the contributors.  I will still try to become a writer although it will be hard and I will not have much time to devote to my writing, being that I will have to keep my job through out the summer.  This is something that I have chosen to do, and I would like to feel the support of anyone who is willing to show it.  To know that I am not alone in this journey will assure me of the purpose in my choice of life.  </div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
There is value in what I propose to do for the contributors and the world.  First off, this summer I will complete my first work of creative writing (my short stories and poems) of which I have already started.  Secondly, and just as important, I will begin my research into topics that interest me and will surely interest my readers and provide insights that are of worth to us all.  These topics range from studies in indigenous people from mexico to the organic produce trade between the U.S. and Mexico.  The common place between these topics, and others, is mainly the human body and the human’s relation to the environment.  At the moment, I am waiting for a response regarding a scholarship to enter a Master’s program either in biology or environmental studies.  I am serious about these studies and my attraction to them is innate.  <br/><br/>    Either way, readers are sure to find my travel logs an amusing read.  Even if these subjects do not interest you perhaps the accounts of my journey will give you pleasure.  People always find me interesting, and I have been told that I always end up talking about myself.  I find this awkward because I am an introvert and I have always thought myself to be quiet and humble.  In my defense, if it seems like I talk too much about myself it is because when I am asked a question about myself I want to give a complete answer otherwise I feel like I am cutting the conversation short, and that is just not polite.  I tend to give people a little bit a history as to where my answer is coming from, and that usually turns into a story in itself.  This is my first campaign and I do not intend to let my contributors or my readers down!<br/><br/><br/>

<h3>*NOTE: I've updated my goal, take a look!</h3>
<h3>The Gist</h3>
<p><em>Once, We Were Stolen</em> is the contemporary tale of a brother and sister who live with their kidnapper for a year. By spending time before, during and after that year, the reader learns the ways in which the three characters are forever changed, and the ways they remain the same.</p>
<p>As a journalist for the Ottawa Business Journal, as well as previously for the West Carleton Review (with various freelance pieces published in the Metro daily newspaper, the Landowner rural magazine, as well as acting as Dan Gardner's research assistant for his book ""Future Babble"" published in 2010), I am constantly writing. My real passion, however, lies in creative fiction. I wrote this novel on an Australian beach in Coolangatta, NSW over the span of three months in 2010. I've been editing it (slowly) ever since and am nearly ready to publish.</p>
<p>My plan is to publish it as an e-book, with the hopes of eventually printing hard copies. This Indiegogo campaign will help me to give this book some wings. I believe that my background in journalism, women studies and psychology adds many layers to my story-telling, and I would love to share a copy with you as soon as it's published so you can read it for yourself.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The UPDATED Goal</h3>
<p>Now that I've achieved more than my goal, I've revised my plan to include an element that I've always wanted and hoped for but didn't think would be possible: A hard copy; a real hold-it-in-your-hands book. </p>
<p>The end result of this campaign will be a published e-book, <strong>and as many physical copies as I can afford to print</strong>. The money will be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hire a graphic designer to help me develop a cover page</li>
<li>Help me to develop my website as well as promotional material for the book including business cards and bookmarks</li>
<li>Have my document converted into an e-book, potentially hiring an editor as well</li>
<li><strong>Print a small amount of hard copies to be sold in local bookstores</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why It's Important</h3>
<p>I have been writing ever since I was a little girl. It's the thing I'm best at. I am confident that, with some help, I can produce a book worth reading. I hope to continue publishing in the future, while continuing my career as a journalist. I would be honoured if you helped me on my path to becoming a novelist.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I will be updating my website with the link to my e-book for online purchasing when I'm able. Even if you can't contribute, or don't want to purchase the e-book when it's available, tell a friend!

Other Ways You Can Help
I will be updating my website with the link to my e-book for online purchasing when I'm able. Even if you can't contribute, or don't want to purchase the e-book when it's available, tell a friend! Start a debate about whether someone could ever learn to love their captor, and if it gets heated, send them my way.
Contact me with questions at courtney-symons@live.ca, or visit my website-in-progress at www.courtneysymons.com.
Read some of my work as a technology and business reporter for the Ottawa Business Journal.
Also, take a look at one of the pieces I wrote while working as a community reporter.
Stay tuned for updates -- I'll post some super old high school fiction I wrote that doesn't make me squirm (a rarity), as well as excerpts from Once, We Were Stolen.
Please feel free to ask any questions about the writing process, character development, self-publishing or what my favourite book(s) is/are.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My father was in a grave mood when he learnt 10 years ago that I want to be a poet. He knew that it is well-nigh impossible to survive being a poet. However, I was determined to do it and with the grace of God has been able to do it with some means.</p>
<h3><strong>About Me</strong></h3>
<p>I am a Mechanical Engineer graduate and I have ventured into writing career. This would be my 3rd poetry book in English. I write in open meter and my poems have received encouraging reviews from the readers across the world. </p>
<p>This book will also contain photos taken by me. So, overall, it will be a coffee-table book.</p>
<h3>My Previous Book</h3>
<p>I have been fortunate to have many friends who are musicians. They shared their work and I have written poems based on their music. The book named 'Odes to Gitanjali' was received well and whoever read it mentioned that it was unique and uplifted their moods.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need the funds to self-publish the book with a reputed publisher and also to market it. With my earlier book, I was limited due to marketing budget though whoever read the book mentioned that it was outstanding.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In India, it's is almost next to impossible to write poetry and live. I want to prove the point that if your poetry has the substance, you can still make it.</p>
<p>Once again, inspired by the music of my friends, I am writing poems and will include their names in the book.</p>

My name is Jason Schroeder and  for over two years I've been studying all about the nature of Hell and Final Punishment. Lately, I've been <a href=""http://jasonschroeder.blogspot.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">blogging</a> a lot about it and there has been great support and interest from friends, colleagues, and abroad. </p>
<p>Recently, I was approached by a member of <a href=""http://rethinkinghell.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">rethinkinghell.com</a> to join their Facebook group because he had found my blog and enjoyed it. Within minutes of joining, another member offered to pay my fee for their <a href=""http://www.rethinkinghellconference.com/2015/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">upcoming conference</a> if I could make it. I am honoured to have this recognition and endorsement and want to accept the offer..</p>
<p>As far as I know, this conference is unprecedented in the history of the church. The theme is 'Conditional Immortality and the Challenge of Universal Salvation.' It will be held at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena California June 18-20 and include speakers from each of the three major views on hell. </p>
<p>The goal is to raise $500 CAD to cover the cost of my flight and accommodation. In return, I will be writing blog posts about each plenary session, breakout session, and the conference as a whole. It is an amazing opportunity and I hope you can contribute to help me get there.</p>

But what you may not realize is how far reaching my blog actually is.

By blogging about the conference many people will have access and feedback they may not otherwise have had.</p>
<p>What I also hope to achieve in attending this conference is to find inspiration, further material, and networking for the book I plan to write and have published on the nature of hell.

The theme and tone will be light and disarming to help readers engage the difficult and often controversial subject.

Hi! I'm Becka. Ever since I was eight years old, I have had a passion for books and storytelling. And after three decades of writing stories for myself, I finally began sharing my stories with The Dragon Wars Saga.
I started posting Dragon Wars online as a fantasy serial back in January of 2010, posting a new part twice a week. Now, after three years without a single missed update, the archive is large enough that it can be intimidating for new readers.
That's why I decided to release the story arcs as individual ebooks. Last year I ran a campaign to publish the first book and raised enough to release it in May of 2012.
Now, it's time for the second!


What We Need & What You Get
Where will the money go?

Proofread: Approx $80
Cover: $20 (Already paid. This was a reduced price from the normal $45 as it took the designer longer than usual to turn it around).
Hiring the Blurb Doctor: $50
Paperback formatting: Approx $80
Non-fixed costs such as proof copies and postage.

These are the necessary costs and will be more than covered by $500.
I'd also like to fund proper paperback distribution to online retailers, rather than just selling it through Lulu. That would require a block of ISBNs and distribution fees, adding an additional $300. That's far above my expected goal but hopefully with your help I can reach it!
If I don't reach my target the book will still be produced and all monies will still go towards it but it may take slightly longer due to having to pay some of the costs myself.
What Do You Get?
Perks include:

Your name in the book
A shoutout on twitter
A copy of the book
A story about your favourite character
And even a chance to name a character in book three!

The Impact
As I mentioned above, I did a campaign last year in March to fund Book One. What I said then still stands today.

New readers can read through the story's archive (at least the first two arcs) without clicking through the web pages.
Established readers can own a copy of the story they've been following all this time.
And last but not least, I won't have to hock the family silver to make a decent book for you. (This is a good thing as I don't have any family silver.)

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>Titanborn is a hard-science fiction story about an extraterrestrial colony on Saturn’s moon, Titan, automation and AI’s influence on work, and genetically-modified humans. It is also a story about Meera and her dear friend Torvram who feel trapped by their world. When Torvram disappears, Meera leaves the safe yet suffocating walls of their colony to save his life and, as she roams the golden dunes, her life changes forever.<br/><br/>My name is Brian Schutter and I am the author of Titanborn. I grew up on good science fiction and I wrote this book to fulfill a lifelong dream: to write the kind of story that inspired me when I was young. Titanborn was created in the midst of a personal crisis.

<p><br/>If you aren’t a science fiction fan, I hope this book makes you one! That said, you will love this book if you are a fan of speculative sci-fi, especially the works of Masamune Shirow, N.K.

<p>Titanborn is targeted at adults, but I would put it's minimum age range at 12+. It's the sort of adult-oriented science fiction book I used to sneak into my bedroom in middle school!

<h2>The Book - Titanborn</h2>
<p>The book is written in three Parts...<br/><br/>In the beginning, Meera is stuck in her home colony of Shangri-La, Titan. She’s worked the same job since fourteen, fixing the brains of robots. Meera was born for this, her genetics carefully designed and her artificial implants all geared towards her place in the Titan colony. Yet she’s miserable, barely able to keep up, and with little to look forward to other than the fight for continued survival. As Meera copes with her troubled life, her close friend and fellow neuroengineer Torvram goes missing.<br/><br/>In the middle, Meera fearfully joins a team of old friends and current enemies, including her ambitious, unempathetic boss Lakshmi and a foul-mouthed man with unaltered genetics and a noticable lack of any cybernetic-implants named Case. This dysfunctional team leaves the warm walls of Shangri-La and travels north, towards the drumbeat of a beacon atop Torvram’s heart.<br/><br/>In the end, Meera must face the mysterious, implacable entity responsible for Torvram’s disappearance. Far from home and further from safety, Meera must stand up to her old boss, challenge the limits of her own abilities, and put the sanctity of her mind at risk to save Torvram from a cold, lonely death, or something even worse.</p>

<h3>Story of my book</h3>
<p>I'm Denise Durgin and I'm the author of <i>Empowered Proton Survivors, Overcoming Cancer &amp; Insurance  Denials.</i></p>
<p>In 2018 I was diagnosed with Stage IIB breast cancer. Through a routine mammogram my main tumor was found. One week later I had an MRI and two more satellite tumors were found by the main tumor that weren't seen on my mammogram.  The span of the three tumors meant I needed to have a mastectomy, and reconstruction surgery. The area was too big to opt for a lumpectomy. Then after surgery, more cancer was found in my lymph node that wasn't detected on the MRI so I needed radiation treatment.</p>
<p>When my doctor told me I needed radiation, I didn't know a thing about it. I thought radiation was just...radiation. It turns out there's different types of radiation. After an initial consult for <strong>photon </strong>(X-Ray) radiation, my doctor  prescribed <strong>proton</strong> radiation  as it's a more targeted form of external beam radiation that targets the tumor, treated area and spares healthy tissues, structures and organs (like the heart) in it's path. Unlike X-rays that pass through the body, proton radiation stops at the targeted site so there's less radiation exposure to the body.</p>
<p>And if all of this wasn't stressful enough. I started working through the insurance process with my doctor and this is where <strong>my pain became my purpose.</strong></p>
<p>My Radiation Oncologist submitted my prior-authorization, the process for insurance to approve or deny payment for treatment. My insurance company declined payment for my case. My doctor appealed my case and they denied it again. Upon a third try, my doctor submitted a nine page comparative case of medical necessity for my proton treatments to be approved.  My case was overturned and insurance approved it, yet my cancer treatments were delayed as we submitted for approval.</p>
<p>It turns out this process of prior-authorization, denial, appeal, denial, appeal and either approval or a final denial happens to so many patients seeking proton radiation from their doctor's recommendation. Many times as patients we hear, <strong><i>""proton treatment is medically unnecessary""  </i></strong>but then sometimes our cases are overturned and insurance pays for treatment.  And sometimes our cases aren't approved. It's so stressful and unnecessary.  I knew when I was ready I needed to do something to help others.</p>
<p>So, I'm writing this book for three reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Educate patients, families and care partners about proton radiation.</li>
<li>Help patients advocate for themselves through insurance denials.</li>
<li value=""3"">Help patients with options of what to do if their cancer treatments are denied  by insurance. </li>
</ul>
<p>In my book you'll learn and hear from:</p>
<ul>
<li>16 patient stories, including <strong>Head Coach Ron Rivera of The Washington Football Team</strong>,<strong> </strong>plus my own story of how we found out about proton radiation.</li>
<li>Many of us patients who fought and appealed to our insurance companies through the support of our physicians and cancer centers.</li>
<li>Courageous patient stories who fought pediatric brain cancer, breast, prostate, lymphoma, thymus and other disease types. </li>
<li>8 Radiation Oncologist physician interviews plus the Chief Medical Officer at Varian, one of the manufacturers of the proton radiation machines.</li>
<li>Jason Wolf the CEO of The Beryl Institute and other  leaders in the field of patient experience and proton radiation.<strong> </strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not a doctor and I'm not prescribing proton radiation. I'm a cancer survivor,  passionate about helping patients, families and care partners.</p>

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<i>Hola Miss</i> is a book about how I changed my mind about immigration. It is memoir-esque and tells the story of my experience working with Central American immigrants.<br/><br/>My name is Mellie Napolitano and I am the author of <i>Hola Miss</i>. I wrote this book to start a conversation among political conservatives like me about reframing immigration policy.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will be able to put a human face on the topic of immigration and immigration policy. I want you to see this book as a tool to help you question your own beliefs about immigration.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn:<ul>
<li>Why Central Americans immigrate to the U.S.</li>
<li>What their lives are like here</li>
<li>How current immigration policies hurt Americans and immigrants</li>
<li>How seeing immigrants as people first can lead to reform</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are interested in learning about immigration in the U.S., told through the lens of someone who worked with Latino immigrants and later voted for Trump.<br/><br/><i>Hola Miss</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to political conservatives and liberals with conservative family members and friends who are looking at Central American immigration and immigration policy for possibly the first time.</p>
<p> </p>

Hola Miss is a book about how I changed my mind about immigration. It is memoir-esque and tells the story of my experience working with Central American immigrants.My name is Mellie Napolitano and I am the author of Hola Miss. I wrote this book to start a conversation among political conservatives like me about reframing immigration policy.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will be able to put a human face on the topic of immigration and immigration policy. I want you to see this book as a tool to help you question your own beliefs about immigration.In this book, you'll learn:
Why Central Americans immigrate to the U.S.
What their lives are like here
How current immigration policies hurt Americans and immigrants
How seeing immigrants as people first can lead to reform

You will love this book if you are interested in learning about immigration in the U.S., told through the lens of someone who worked with Latino immigrants and later voted for Trump.Hola Miss is a non-fiction book that speaks to political conservatives and liberals with conservative family members and friends who are looking at Central American immigration and immigration policy for possibly the first time.

The book is written in 2 Parts....Part 1 describes how my experience working with immigrants showed me that conservative immigration policies don’t achieve their intended results.Part 2 is about how to craft immigration policies that recognize the dignity of immigrants while maintaining our borders and strength as a nation.

<p>Harkimer is stirring. A distant and foreboding kingdom tucked away in the Southern Mountains, it is home to the dark wizards, who were banished after their defeat in a war against the other kingdoms of Ilian centuries before.</p>
<p>Now a clever, despotic leader has emerged, one who can end the dark wizards’ exile.  He is the wizard with a rare obsidian staff of unparalleled magic and power.  But even as he plans his attack on the land, he is haunted by a prophecy and will stop at nothing to prevent it from coming true...</p>

<p>​Sixteen-year old Kate Smith would give everything to regain her memories.  Orphaned by a fire and sent to live with her Aunt Millie, a wealthy, eccentric art dealer in the suburbs of London, Kate is determined to unravel clues about her past and the family she lost.  Kate soon discovers she has powers she doesn't understand and can't control.  When she summons a magical flames and ice to protect her best friend from bullies, Kate realizes she needs to learn more about the magic.  But who can teach her? </p>
<p>When Kate escapes an attack in London, she finds herself transported to a world where her powers are common - the mystical land of Ilian.  She has friends sworn to protect her - men, elves and wizards not joined with the dark wizards of Harkimer.  But her greatest threat comes from Diamantas, the leader of the dark wizards and the possessor of a rare obsidian staff of unequaled power.   Kate is forced to quickly learn the truth about her identity to battle the wizard who hunts her - and to how to master her powers.  For Kate has a secret that terrifies her allies and enemies alike, one more dangerous to the kingdoms of Ilian that Diamantas himself. </p>

<h3>HOW I FOUND KATE SMITH</h3>
</div><div>
<p>I’m Jaz, author of <i>The Obsidian Staff</i> and the follow-on three books in<i> The Lost Legacy Series</i>!  I’m as devoted to writing as a die-hard Star Wars fan who drives hundreds of miles cross-country to attend a Comic-con convention in a Stormtrooper outfit.</p>

<p><i>The Obsidian Staff</i> started as an accidental venture in 2012.  I was sitting in my cubicle, lights dimmed, typing a succinct memo, the standard sort that was strictly limited to five, adjective-free bullet points.  I was fully unaware that these cookie-cutter communications could cause irreparable damage to my imaginative story-telling.</p>
<p>Except that Kate decided to intervene.</p>
<p>I was jolted out of my colorless, cubicle world by a character who surfaced from the recesses of my mind.  It was a teenage girl sitting at the edge of a cliff in the moonlight, wistfully contemplating her place in and impact on her world.  Envisioning the girl, I realized she was reaching out before I was beyond creative redemption. </p>
<p>I started rabidly typing as Kate began to narrate her story to me.</p>
<p>One year later, voila!  The Obsidian Staff was born.</p>

<h3>THE COST OF PUBLISHING </h3>
<p>According to the <a href=""http://www.the-efa.org/res/rates.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Editorial Freelancers Association</a>, the cost for a developmental editor – whose job is to review content and story flow, not proofread for grammar or punctuation – can cost between $40-$60/hour (reading up to 6 manuscript pages/hour).  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481675687/xnt7coxehukb4hj44hxu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I’ve researched the average prices for the basic services needed to publish the book, which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Editor, substantive or line: 1–6 ms pgs/hr, $40–60/hr, 420 pages: The actual cost of the developmental editor I used: $3.000 USD/read.</li>
<li>Editor, basic copyediting: 5-10 ms pgs/hr, $30-40/hr, 420 pages: $1,680 USD</li>
<li>Cover artist: $200 USD</li>
<li>Formatting (<a href=""http://www.firsteditiondesignpublishing.com/html/packages.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">eBook conversion</a>): $149 USD</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Minimum total (approximately): $</strong></p>
<p>I initially intended to raise looking to raise a minimum of <strong>$6,000 USD.</strong>   With your help, we were successful!!  However, the cost of the developmental editor was $3,000 USD.  She was worth every penny, reading through the novel with a fine-toothed comb and greatly enhancing the quality and logic of the material.  As I submit a second read-through, the cost will likely be the same.  This means that I will need more than the initial estimate of $6,000 USD.  For the remaining costs, I need to raise at least an additional <b>$2,000 USD</b>.  If this money can't be raised, I will continue to use my savings and whatever else it takes to make the novel available to you as an eBook and eventually hardcopy!</p>

The contributors within followed the path dug by the few trans writers who are now starting to get some recognition, and took inspiration from the knowledge that within the trans community there is a huge wellspring of talent, knowledge and experience. The result is something quite extraordinary. Within these pages you will find faith, and passion, and struggle. You will find anger and you will find laughter. You will find strategies for surviving a racist misogynist world. Strategies for navigating parenthood. You will find sex (because this is not a children’s book) and reckoning. You will find mountains and moorland, a cigarette scraped across the wall of a pub and a size 9 stiletto. You will find pieces of Lego that make sense of the world and a haircut at the best barbershop in London. Most importantly, you will find a range of experiences and a wealth of trans voices, each different, speaking loud, and proud, and together. Who is TransBareAll?TransBareAll is a trans led, volunteer-run organisation that works with trans people to explore feelings around bodies, sexual health and intimacy. In that time, the organisation has grown from two friends wanting to share their experiences to a steadily growing management team organising 3 - 4 residential events each year in the UK. TBA has thrived over the last ten years. We felt we needed to mark this milestone in a way that raises our voices, representing the diversity within our community and our stories. Our writers and artists have created an incredible book - and now we need your help: The good news is that the book is ready to print! We have managed to secure some funding towards our production costs but we still need to raise another £5100 to make this happen.We have a variety of tiers and rewards for donations, and we appreciate every donation made to help bring this book out into the world. Any additional funds raised will go towards our ongoing commitment to strengthening our inclusion of People of Colour at TBA events._________________________________More About Rewards Digital ThanksWe'll send you a digital Thank You from the team to thank you for your support.Thank You and Sticker SetWe'll send you a Thank You Postcard and a Set of 3 Stickers using artwork from the book10th Anniversary SetAlong with a Thank You Postcard and Sticker Set, you'll also get a limited edition TBA 10th Anniversary Pin and a 10 Years, Still Here BookmarkTransbareall - 10 Years, Still Here Ebook and Digital ThanksWant to keep it all online?

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>We are Paul Kingsnorth, Dougald Hine and Adrienne Odasso, editors of the third Dark Mountain book.</p>
<p>Over the last two years, with the generous support of many people around the world, we've been able to raise the publishing costs of our first two books by pre-selling copies through this site. Now we're aiming to do the same for Dark Mountain: Book 3.</p>
<p>Three years after the Dark Mountain project began life, our work seems more relevant than ever. As economies crumble and nature rebels, our call for the 'uncivilising' of writing, art and culture, and our search for better stories to help us navigate unfolding realities, have taken on, it seems to us, a more urgent note. </p>
<p>So we're very excited about this book. Like its two predecessors it will be a beautifully designed hardback, with a specially-commissioned cover and several dozen colour plates, typeset by our artisan friends at Bracketpress and printed on ecologically responsible materials. It will contain our trademark mix of essays, poems, stories, flash fiction, photography, art and the entirely indefinable, all intended to shake up the stories of our civilisation and make space for new stories to emerge. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Book</h3>
<p>Highlights of the book's contents include:</p>
<ul>
<li>James Hester on the Three Lessons of History;</li>
<li>Conversations with Dmitri Orlov, Doug and Kris Tompkins and Sajay Samuel; </li>
<li>New fiction from Margaret Irish, Nick Hunt, Chris TT, David Kernohan and Gregory Norminton;</li>
<li>Caspar Henderson on our barely imagined prehistory;</li>
<li>Andrew Taggart takes apart Descartes in the latest in our 'myths of civilisation' series;</li>
<li>Bridget McKenzie explores orchards and Phil Brachi searches for faeries;</li>
<li>New poetry from Em Strang, George Roberts, Roselle Angwin, Eleanor Rees and many others;</li>
<li>Plus: photo essays, stained glass, paintings, illuminated poetry and a unique, specially-commissioned cover.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As with our previous two books, we are working with Christian Brett at Bracketpress to design and publish the book. To cover his work, the printing costs and the cost of the editorial team, we are looking to raise $9,800 (around £6,100) through pre-orders between now and the end of June.</p>
<p>This is not a call for donations - everyone who contributes will get a copy of the book as soon as it's published. For $30, we'll send a copy to you, wherever you are in the world. For $60, we'll also add your name to the 'roll of honour' in the back of the book, if you'd like us to. And anyone who can pledge $150 will get a copy of the book, their name in the roll of honour and a limited edition print of the cover, signed by the artist, Mattias Jones.</p>

We are Paul Kingsnorth, Dougald Hine and Adrienne Odasso, editors of the third Dark Mountain book.
Over the last two years, with the generous support of many people around the world, we've been able to raise the publishing costs of our first two books by pre-selling copies through this site. Now we're aiming to do the same for Dark Mountain: Book 3.
Three years after the Dark Mountain project began life, our work seems more relevant than ever.

It will contain our trademark mix of essays, poems, stories, flash fiction, photography, art and the entirely indefinable, all intended to shake up the stories of our civilisation and make space for new stories to emerge. 


The Book
Highlights of the book's contents include:

James Hester on the Three Lessons of History;
Conversations with Dmitri Orlov, Doug and Kris Tompkins and Sajay Samuel; 
New fiction from Margaret Irish, Nick Hunt, Chris TT, David Kernohan and Gregory Norminton;
Caspar Henderson on our barely imagined prehistory;
Andrew Taggart takes apart Descartes in the latest in our 'myths of civilisation' series;

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>So a little about me! I began my self-publishing journey in October of 2016. My first self-published book is titled ""A Beautiful, Wonderful Me"", which is a positive affirmation poem book for young girls. That book was the stepping stone towards my other published books. I have then gone on to self-publish 4 other books that aim to transform the minds of our youth. </p>
<p>I strongly believe that words have power and it is my goal to inspire and transform minds with each book I create. In a world full of negativity, I aim to inspire self-love, creativity, &amp; positivity. This movement is so important to me that I created my own business around it called A Beautiful, Wonderful Me (ABWM). ABWM creates products and content that will inspire, motivate, and ignite the next generation.</p>
<p> I hope you can assist me by helping me bring this book project to life!</p>
<h3>What I Need </h3>
</div><div><p>Self-publishing is no cheap task! I am aiming to raise $750 for this project.

So a little about me! I began my self-publishing journey in October of 2016. My first self-published book is titled ""A Beautiful, Wonderful Me"", which is a positive affirmation poem book for young girls. That book was the stepping stone towards my other published books. I have then gone on to self-publish 4 other books that aim to transform the minds of our youth. 
I strongly believe that words have power and it is my goal to inspire and transform minds with each book I create. In a world full of negativity, I aim to inspire self-love, creativity, & positivity. This movement is so important to me that I created my own business around it called A Beautiful, Wonderful Me (ABWM). ABWM creates products and content that will inspire, motivate, and ignite the next generation.
 I hope you can assist me by helping me bring this book project to life!
What I Need

<h3><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Hi everybody! I wrote a book! That is not a sentence I ever thought I would type out. Your support will help me turn my book into an actual reality over the next several months. </strong></p>
<p>My name is Morgan Edwards and I am the author of <i>An Outlier's Tribe: Growing Up Torn Between Trump's Appalachia and the Liberal Coast</i>. <i>An Outlier's Tribe</i> is centered around my experience growing up in Appalachia as a progressive outlier and my reflections and commentary on this dynamic. I wrote this book because I wanted to grapple with my experiences growing up in a region where I often felt out of place. The further I am physically and temporarily removed from the place in which I grew up, the more I anticipate feeling disconnected — unable to meaningfully grapple with that era of my life. Further, in currently attending a school that represents the antithesis of home, I look back from a unique vantage point on the first 18 years of my life spent in Appalachia.<br/>Combining research and personal anecdotes, I shed light on the widely misunderstood Appalachian region and polarized state of this country as a whole. My hope is that my own personal introspection may spur you to self-reflect, critically think about your own upbringing, and consider the current political moment.<br/>In this book, I’ll touch on what it was like to grow up in two differing environments, particularly as a progressive outlier within deeply conservative Appalachia. Some stories include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discussion of coal’s importance in the region</li>
<li>My mom’s tales from her time on city council</li>
<li>Organizing a school walkout to protest gun violence</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you are an outsider in some way — perhaps politically, socially, or culturally, are concerned about increasing political divisions in this country, or are simply interested in learning more about Appalachia, I hope you will be able to find value in the book.</p>
<h3>The Book - An Outlier's Tribe</h3>The book is written from three frames of thought:<ul>
<li>I am writing about a region that is oft-misunderstood and forgotten about</li>
<li>I, myself, often struggled to understand Appalachia as an outlier in the region</li>
<li>I am now writing from the perspective of one who attends an institution that represents the complete opposite of Appalachia</li>
</ul>
<p>It contains 5 parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Part 1 contains the introduction + additional chapters that lay the groundwork of the region and where my family fits in.</li>
<li>Part 2 sets up the dynamic of being an outlier &amp; how it manifested in my daily life.</li>
<li>Part 3 grapples with the implications of growing up in the region as an outlier, especially now from from the vantage point of a college student.</li>
<li>Part 4 contains reflections and commentary on some of the issues facing the region.</li>
<li>Part 5 is an epilogue with final reflections.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How Your Funding Helps &amp; What You'll Get</h3> Your support will allow me to fund the publishing costs that will turn my book into a physical reality. The book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<ul>
<li>The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in July 2020</li>

<li>The Copyediting for my Book - to help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication</li>
<li>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this summer 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>When I pre-sell 100 copies of my book, I will publish! When I pre-sell 150 copies, I will also publish an audiobook. When I pre-sell 200 copies, I will publish a hardcover edition.</p>

<p>The research and creation of my first book “<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Pilot-Great-Lakes-John-Kotzian/dp/1892384698"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sky Pilot of the Great Lakes</a>” took over 4 years from inception to publication. Along the way I
learned many things about the researching and publication process. The biggest
lesson I learned is that while there is a wealth of archival information out
there to be researched, access to these archives is neither simple nor free endeavor.  When researching a single subject or event with
the goal of telling a complete story I had to comb through archival documents
scattered around the world in the hopes of finding even the smallest bit of
information that would help fill in the gaps of the overall story. </p>
<p>While the effort to digitize and create searchable indexes
of these documents in recent decades has helped researchers immensely, the vast
majority of documents remain in their original form or on microfiche in a file
cabinet at some library or museum. Access to these files requires a personal
visit during established hours or paying fees to have the staff find what you
need for you. In the event they do find something there are even more fees to
make copies and ship them to you. Even some of the largest online resources are
not accessible without purchasing a subscription.</p>
<p>A conservative estimate of the cost associated with the
research of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Pilot-Great-Lakes-John-Kotzian/dp/1892384698"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sky Pilot of the Great Lakes</a> is approximately $5000. This included
subscriptions, fees associated with research at various libraries and
collections throughout the United States &amp; Canada and travel costs to
collections where there was no other option but to appear in person.  Since I didn’t have $5000 up-front to use for
this research, expenditures had to be budgeted over time which in turn
lengthened the time to actually write and bring the book to publication. </p>
<p><b>What I’m Asking &amp; What You Get In Return</b></p>
<p>I am currently working on three follow-up books, 2
non-fiction historical books like Sky Pilot of the Great Lakes and a
semi-fictional book of humorous short stories based on travels around the state
of Michigan. One of the historical books will be a biography of Capt. Albert
Ocha, one of the most-celebrated men in the United States Life-Saving Service.
The second will be a companion book to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Pilot-Great-Lakes-John-Kotzian/dp/1892384698"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sky Pilot of the Great Lakes</a> that will
(hopefully) feature transcriptions of every yearly book that Rev. William H.
Law mailed to every Lighthouse and Life-Saving station in the United States
from 1900 to 1928. </p>
<p>While I have the drive and passion to complete these books,
once again the costs associated with research are determining the length of
time required to complete the stories for publication. So I decided to try my
hand at some crowdfunding the project to attempt to inject some capital into
the project, thus shortening the timeline. </p>
<p>This is where you can help.  By helping to fund my project  you can help expedite my ability to access these
historical archives which will allow me to tell a more complete and robust
story.  Just as every little bit of
information comes together to tell a complete story, every dollar contributed
by a single person to this campaign can help to progress the research to find
those little pieces of information. </p>
<p>In return for contributions I am offering a few perks in the sidebar right over there ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;</p><p>Please note that any perks related to future publications do not have a guaranteed publication date as they are dependent upon the research you are helping to fund as well as the length of time for the publication process.</p>
<p><b>Why History Matters</b></p>
<p>My goal with these projects is to piece together the
fragmented stories of the people, places and deeds of those who came before us.
It is my hope that my effort in bringing these stories to the public will
inspire and teach future generations about who we were on our way to becoming
who we are, and possibly help shape who we become along the way.  </p>
<p>By documenting these stories there is also the possibility
that a reader may become inspired enough to help preserve some of the remaining
historical locations such as the lighthouses and the few remaining Life-Saving
Stations that dot our shores. There are many organizations dedicated to
preserving these pieces of history and making them available to the public.
There’s also an economical aspect to our historical heritage. </p>
<p>There’s a possibility that if the story is compelling enough
a reader may travel to these historical locations to stand where the
subjects of these stories once stood, the by-product of this being an
economical boost, no matter how slight, to the local economies. </p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>As with any project there are known risks and
challenges. Some of the challenges for this project include:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no set date or cost to the research.
     I will be researching until all sources of information have dried up
     and/or I have uncovered enough information to do the story justice. </li>
<li>While I have a publisher for my current book, there
     is no guarantee that I will be able to secure a publisher for these
     projects. However there is always the option of self-publishing them. </li>
<li>I am setting the goal for this campaign lower
     than the anticipated costs in an attempt to set a goal that I believe can
     be met. Any costs accrued beyond the funds received in this campaign will again have to be budgeted over time as stated earlier, thus lengthening the time
     to print. </li>

<h3>Language learning starts early </h3>
<p>I'm Anu Anand, a BBC and Guardian journalist currently based in New Delhi with two young children. Ever since my son was born six years ago, I've been determined to teach him Hindi, in which I'm fluent. But I soon realized that even living in India, he wasn't going to pick it up unless he heard it constantly. I'm sure as a parent, this is a familiar scene: it's bedtime, your child is clean and in their pajamas; a hectic day is coming to an end. You desperately want to read him or her a story in Hindi, either by making it up, or translating an existing favorite English title. But by the time you sit down, ticking over all the chores waiting for you, you can barely keep your eyes open. <br/><br/>Wouldn't it be such a gift to find simple, original, beautifully produced books suitable for toddlers in English and Hindi: with lines in Devanagri for those parents who can read Hindi and in 'Roman' for those who only understand spoken Hindi? What if these books had beautiful and imaginative hand-made illustrations that were a joy for you to savor, as much as for your child? <br/></p>
<p>A tiny dose of beautiful India at bedtime, no matter where you might be...!<br/></p>
<p>Maybe you've looked for these books, but can only find bilingual titles in French, German, Spanish, and the odd one in Chinese? Or if you've picked up a few books while in India, they're either too complex for babies and toddlers, or badly produced? <br/></p>
<p>They say babies begin to discern languages when they're only a few months old. What better intellectual gift can you give a child than his/her native language right from the start? <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I've already produced the first book, 'Meri Bindi' or 'My Bindi'. A bindi, of course, is that iconic Indian symbol of adornment worn on the forehead. Everyone loves bindis, and in this book, young readers can follow along as the bindis turn up in enchanted places! <br/></p>
<p>The illustrations, created by Lavanya Karthik in Mumbai, are sumptuous, detailed, whimsical and charming! You've got to see the way they pop off the page - computer screens don't really do them justice. Each detail on each page, from the boy's curls to the tiny dots on the ladybug's back are individual pieces of paper, torn or cut to size by hand! <br/></p>
<p>I've also got a highly reputable children's publisher interested in distributing the book and in creating a series called 'Meri Duniya' (My World). However, because it is an untested market, I have to pay for the first print run of a thousand books. My aim is to start a new movement in bilingual children's literature. Wouldn't it be wonderful to see books in Indian languages from Assamese to Urdu and every wonderful language in between? Imagine being able to share your love of Punjabi, or Bengali, even if you're raising your child in Arizona or Birmingham? </p>
<ul>
<li>All donations fund the first, high-quality print run of Meri Bindi. I personally get no money, just the satisfaction of seeing these books in print finally. <br/>
</li>
<li>Donations of $8 or more get a free, signed copy and a packet of bindis!<br/>
</li>
<li>Donations of $30 also get an artwork print from the book</li>
<li>Donations of $100 also get you an acknowledgment in the next volume<br/>
</li>
</ul> <p></p>
</div>That's it! This book is 20 pages (including two pages of easy Hindi vocabulary with pictures). With your help, children all over the world will be able to cuddle up with  a beautifully produced book in a language spoken by at least 1.2 billion people. I'd also like to develop a YouTube channel with original content, as well as expand to other Indian languages... and who knows, if all goes well, the next step will be Hindi/Spanish books. 
¡Qué ilusión!
<br/><br/><div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you can't contribute, but want to help:</p> <ul> <li>Spread the word to interested parents.</li> <li>Read to your own baby/child in Hindi (and other native languages). <br/>
</li>
<li>Have a 'Hindi only' day at home, once a week. <br/>
</li>
<li>Make a YouTube playlist of favorite Hindi kids songs to play for your child. <br/>
</li>
<li>Have a Hindi play date with other children, with songs and stories. <br/>

But I soon realized that even living in India, he wasn't going to pick it up unless he heard it constantly. I'm sure as a parent, this is a familiar scene: it's bedtime, your child is clean and in their pajamas; a hectic day is coming to an end. You desperately want to read him or her a story in Hindi, either by making it up, or translating an existing favorite English title. But by the time you sit down, ticking over all the chores waiting for you, you can barely keep your eyes open. Wouldn't it be such a gift to find simple, original, beautifully produced books suitable for toddlers in English and Hindi: with lines in Devanagri for those parents who can read Hindi and in 'Roman' for those who only understand spoken Hindi? What if these books had beautiful and imaginative hand-made illustrations that were a joy for you to savor, as much as for your child? 
A tiny dose of beautiful India at bedtime, no matter where you might be...!
Maybe you've looked for these books, but can only find bilingual titles in French, German, Spanish, and the odd one in Chinese? Or if you've picked up a few books while in India, they're either too complex for babies and toddlers, or badly produced? 
They say babies begin to discern languages when they're only a few months old. What better intellectual gift can you give a child than his/her native language right from the start? 

 
What I Need & What You Get I've already produced the first book, 'Meri Bindi' or 'My Bindi'. A bindi, of course, is that iconic Indian symbol of adornment worn on the forehead. Everyone loves bindis, and in this book, young readers can follow along as the bindis turn up in enchanted places! 
The illustrations, created by Lavanya Karthik in Mumbai, are sumptuous, detailed, whimsical and charming! You've got to see the way they pop off the page - computer screens don't really do them justice. Each detail on each page, from the boy's curls to the tiny dots on the ladybug's back are individual pieces of paper, torn or cut to size by hand! 
I've also got a highly reputable children's publisher interested in distributing the book and in creating a series called 'Meri Duniya' (My World). However, because it is an untested market, I have to pay for the first print run of a thousand books. My aim is to start a new movement in bilingual children's literature. Wouldn't it be wonderful to see books in Indian languages from Assamese to Urdu and every wonderful language in between? Imagine being able to share your love of Punjabi, or Bengali, even if you're raising your child in Arizona or Birmingham? 

All donations fund the first, high-quality print run of Meri Bindi. I personally get no money, just the satisfaction of seeing these books in print finally. 

Donations of $8 or more get a free, signed copy and a packet of bindis!

Donations of $30 also get an artwork print from the book
Donations of $100 also get you an acknowledgment in the next volume

 
That's it! This book is 20 pages (including two pages of easy Hindi vocabulary with pictures). With your help, children all over the world will be able to cuddle up with  a beautifully produced book in a language spoken by at least 1.2 billion people. I'd also like to develop a YouTube channel with original content, as well as expand to other Indian languages... and who knows, if all goes well, the next step will be Hindi/Spanish books. 
¡Qué ilusión!
 Other Ways You Can Help If you can't contribute, but want to help:  Spread the word to interested parents. Read to your own baby/child in Hindi (and other native languages). 

Have a 'Hindi only' day at home, once a week. 

Make a YouTube playlist of favorite Hindi kids songs to play for your child. 

Have a Hindi play date with other children, with songs and stories.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Newsnet is the oldest independence supporting news site. Since we first launched in March 2010 there has been a growing number of independence-supporting websites. They are our companions, not our competitors. The competition is the unionist owned, foreign owned media.</p>
<h3>Newsnet is moving and relaunching</h3>
<p>Now is the time, in the lead up to indyref2, for a new phase in our development .  </p>
<p>After publishing over 10,000 articles and engaging with so many readers, the database is massive and cumbersome with over 250,000 comments and 10,000 readers logged to post comments. The sheer scale of the database means a major clean up is required before the new site goes live. Newsnet is not a simple blog.</p>
<p>With our increased capacity to make more use of images and graphics in stories, mirroring major online news development, the amount of data stored will only increase. It’s organisation needs to be more sophisticated so the editorial team can quickly locate images held on file.</p>
<p>We now need our own dedicated server, upgraded software packages, to resolve issues with out-dated plug-ins and essential coding written for the new site. The present site will continue until the launch of the new site.</p>
<p>The entire contents of the present site will move to an offline server while the new site is constructed and tested.  </p>
<h3>Who am I </h3>
<p>I have been writing on politics and the economy for Newsnet for the last 7 years and in recent months I have become the face behind the Newsnet Newsroom - sourcing writers, writing, editing and producing images and graphics. I have a background in advertising, PR,  graphics, publishing, print and event management. For 8 years I was a board member of Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park Authority. The first among five members, ever elected to a public board.</p>
<h3>The editorial prospectus</h3>
<p>I will continue to bring you news and analysis not to be found in the MSM. Newsnet is not just about providing news to independence supporters but also aims to reach out to those who did not vote Yes in 2014. We want to engage with, and help readers engage with our fellow citizens, encouraging them to join us in building a better Scotland - a Scotland free from the antiquity of Westminster, austerity free, outward looking, working with our European neighbours and those further afield, willing to learn from their experiences, sharing aspirations and involved in cross-border collaboration.</p>
<p>In the run-up to 2014 National Collective brought together artists, poets, writers and musicians to provide months of inspirational events to highlight Scotland’s diverse culture and keep our spirits buoyant. I would like Newsnet to become something of a News Collective - a space where the growing army of independence bloggers could share an occasional article, adding diversity of opinions for our mutual advantage.</p>
<h3>What we need the funds for</h3>
<p>We are only too aware of the demands on the generosity of Independence supporters so have kept this fundraiser to the minimum to invest in the new site, cover server and allied costs for the next 12 months. Newsnet has not run a fundraiser in the last 4 years. So please donate what you can towards our revamp.</p>
<p>The budget is split down as follows: £1200 is allocated to web development, coding and associated cost; £900 to cover monthly server charges, SSL fee and domain charges for the next 12 months.</p>
<p>The Newsroom needs fast and powerful connections and internal storage capacity. Some hardware bits and bobs and updated software comes to £500. The editorial support budget of £650 covers subscriptions, misc research charges, expenses, etc. £350 is allocated to a small promotional budget, £200 for any incidental design work and £180 for subscriber perks.</p>
<p><strong>So our total spend budget comes to £3,980 but we need to add Indiegogo fees and card payment charges of around £520, bringing the amount sought up to £4,500.</strong></p>
<p>Our writers are not paid. There is no budget for that.  They are all treated equally unfairly. By supporting this fundraiser you will ensure their voices are heard, their arguments, analysis, reporting and insights are published for others to benefit from. For now, reward enough on the road to Independence.</p>
<h3>Should we meet target we have a stretch budget item we are excited about</h3>
<p>Like everybody else involved in the online media, Newsnet is in the news business and we want to reach the parts online does not reach - so we are planning a pilot tabloid edition of Newsnet that will reach out to groups outside the online community and social media - especially older voters and those who have moved to Scotland from south of the Border.  The intention of the tabloid edition is to engage and inform with lively and accessible content. </p>
<p>The additional budget requirement for the development of this pilot tabloid print edition is £525. Enough for a short print run of 8,000 to 10,000. The intention would be to distribute supplies to Yes groups through our existing links with ayeMail and the National Yes Registry. Yes groups would pay ayeMail for distribution logistics and carriage, as was done with the Keep Scotland the Brand and the current leaflets and posters on tax, which include analysis by Newsnet showing how taxes and charges are lower in Scotland for the vast majority of the population.</p>
<h3>That’s it folks</h3>
<p>Exactly what we plan to do if we reach target and a little extra if we meet the stretch budget. </p>
<p>Newsnet Scotland is in this for the longterm and we envisage a future beyond independence. Achieving independence is a gateway to Scotland’s future in the world. Thereafter, what really matters it is what we do with it to deliver our nation's aspirations.</p>

<p>Somos Kampio,</p>
<p>Somos 7 socios con una meta en común: cambiar la innovación. Desde el comienzo, hemos querido ofrecer productos que en México simplemente son muy caros o no existen. Nuestra meta es proveer productos accesibles que cambiarán la  forma de ver al mundo.</p>
<p>KeVR es nuestro primer proyecto, se trata de unos lentes de realidad virtual basados en Google Cardboard que sirven para viajar a muchos lugares; desde el interior de una célula, hasta el espacio exterior. La realidad virtual, es la representación de escenas o imágenes fotorrealistas de objetos producida por un sistema informático, que da la sensación de su existencia real.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://kevr.kampio.co/image1.GIF"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<p>A comparación de otros lentes de realidad virtual como el gear VR que cuestan alrededor de $3,000 MXN, KeVR costará menos de $200 MXN.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>¿Qué necesitamos?</strong></p>
<p>Necesitamos una inversión inicial para empezar a producir y vender nuestro producto, y con esto desarrollar muchos más. En vez de ir con un inversionista convencional, acudimos a nuestra familia y amigos para conseguir los fondos. Todo apoyo es bienvenido.</p> <p>Pedimos $10,000 USD para las siguientes cosas:</p>
<p>1. Compraremos los materiales necesarios para producir los KeVR. Nuestro objetivo es producir por lo menos 1,000 visores para poder proveerlos a escuelas, instituciones y personas. Esto incluye:</p>
<ul>
<li>Costos de manufactura de las cajas para los visores.</li>
<li>Impresión de diseño sobre las cajas para los visores.</li>
<li>Compra e importación desde China de los lentes biconvexos y cinta conductiva.</li>
<li>Ensamblaje del visor.</li>
<li>Smartphones para ofrecerlos en paquete con los visores a instituciones.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Parte de nuestro proyecto será crear contenido para KeVR, con esto, Kampio brindará una nueva manera de aprender y acercarte al conocimiento.   </p>
<ul>
<li>Necesitaremos cámaras de 360 grados de alta resolución.</li>
<li>Software de diseño.</li>
<li>Equipo de audio.</li>
<li>Desarrollo de una aplicación para contenido VR.</li>
</ul>

<p>4. KeVR es sólo el comienzo, anteriormente habíamos invertido en una impresora 3D, que obtendremos en los siguientes meses. Uno de los siguientes proyectos de Kampio es la manufactura de nuestros propios drones; cuando esta sociedad era tan sólo una idea, desarrollamos un prototipo, sin embargo por diversas fallas técnicas y faltas de capital, este mismo falló. Con tu ayuda, queremos y haremos, mediante el uso de la impresión 3D, drones con acceso a un mayor sector de la población y de alta calidad. Para lograr esto:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compra e importación de unidad de procesamiento.</li>
<li>Compra e importación de controles de larga distancia.</li>
<li>Compra e importación de GPS, giroscopios, acelerómetros, entre otros.</li>

<p>5. La impresión 3D está iniciando una revolución en la manera en la que creamos. Sin embargo, como lo ha planteado nuestra campaña, la realidad virtual, los drones y las impresoras 3D, están fuera del alcance de la mayoría. Mientras que KeVR se trata de experimentar, nuestra impresora se trata de crear y esta misma está limitada a los más privilegiados. Kampio está comprometido con el ideal de distribuir a un precio mas accesible estos productos, por lo cual construiremos nuestra propia impresora.</p>

Mi función en Kampio es, entre muchas otras cosas, siempre tener las últimas noticias en innovación y productos de vanguardia para que siempre haya un nuevo proyecto innovador en la empresa. La razón por la que estoy en Kampio es para intentar llevar la tecnología más moderna a la sociedad mexicana e intentar de reducir la inequidad existente en nuestro país.

<p>The Black Box Stories project is a community-based funding campaign to help an unpublished aspiring writer publish their first novel. The current author of the project (that would be me at this moment in time) will pass the project on to the next aspiring writer once their Black Box Story is completed. It's a funding/mentoring project to help writers get published.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What’s unique about this project?</h2>
<p>The project takes a bit of “mad libs” and mixes it with “choose your own adventure” stories. Each person who supports this project is inherently part of the story because they will give me an idea (Mad Libs input) which the author then develops into a full blown novel (the choose the adventure element). </p>
<p>The community fuels its development, completion and success. If the project is a success, it’s because the community believed in it and was a part of it; they will in turn be immortalized in the story through ideas and words. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>How will the money be used?</h2>
<p>Originally, I aimed high on this project based on the research available online - maybe a little higher than I could realistically get. On the plus side, I've been given great advice and assistance with the project. I have been able to cut costs and make the money stretch as far as possible. So, any money that is contributed will be first put to use in these three catagories:</p>
<p>1. Printed Paperback and E-book (includes layout, formatting and shipping)</p>
<p>2. Copy Editing (grammar corrections and content analysis)</p>
<p>3. Cover Artwork (by local artist)</p>
<p>I have applied for a Writing Grant from the Canada Council for Arts. So, fingers-crossed I get it and I will be able to write full-time for 4 months in a remote cottage. </p>
<p>I will utilize the GoDaddy Website Builder service and set-up my own author website to promote my work... all for under $15/year... wicked!</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.5em;""> </span></p>
<h2>Why are these items important to complete the project?</h2>
<p>These items will allow me to publish an original Black Box Story and provide my contributors with a tangible result.  I promised my contributors that I would provide them with a paperback copy and/or an e-book and that’s just what I’ll be able to do with this support. </p>
<ul>
<li>The website development is essential to marketing this project, creating a community around it, and providing a social media type of interaction for the community. <span>This professional website will also not only provide information and sales of future publications, it will also keep readers current with upcoming events and insight into what I’m currently working on.</span>
</li>
<li>Copy editing is essential to any writers’ success. We get so wrapped up in our work that we fail to notice minor spelling errors or grammatical inconsistencies. Our completed work would not be as successful if a copy editor didn’t mark it all up first.</li>
<li>Every printed novel needs an eye-catching cover to draw in the interests of potential customers. For this aspect of the project, I would support an emerging local artist by commissioning them to design the cover and help them launch their career.</li>

<p>Can’t find that perfect gift? Give someone the gift of immortality through words. Create a character based on or for them.</p>
<p>Is there someone in your life making it a living hell? Use the world of fiction to seek retribution. I’ll ensure justice is served on your behalf.</p>
<p>Maybe you really love your best friend... the cute, cuddly, always there when you get home best friend... your pet! Characters are not limited to humans.</p>
<p>Pay it forward! I’m a big fan of this concept. Ideally I would like to keep the project going in the future on an annual basis. New donors, new story and new emerging writer to help get noticed.</p>

The current author of the project (that would be me at this moment in time) will pass the project on to the next aspiring writer once their Black Box Story is completed. It's a funding/mentoring project to help writers get published.  
 
What’s unique about this project?
The project takes a bit of “mad libs” and mixes it with “choose your own adventure” stories. Each person who supports this project is inherently part of the story because they will give me an idea (Mad Libs input) which the author then develops into a full blown novel (the choose the adventure element). 
The community fuels its development, completion and success. If the project is a success, it’s because the community believed in it and was a part of it; they will in turn be immortalized in the story through ideas and words. 
 
How will the money be used?
Originally, I aimed high on this project based on the research available online - maybe a little higher than I could realistically get. On the plus side, I've been given great advice and assistance with the project. I have been able to cut costs and make the money stretch as far as possible. So, any money that is contributed will be first put to use in these three catagories:
1. Printed Paperback and E-book (includes layout, formatting and shipping)
2. Copy Editing (grammar corrections and content analysis)
3. Cover Artwork (by local artist)
I have applied for a Writing Grant from the Canada Council for Arts. So, fingers-crossed I get it and I will be able to write full-time for 4 months in a remote cottage. 
I will utilize the GoDaddy Website Builder service and set-up my own author website to promote my work... all for under $15/year... wicked!
 
Why are these items important to complete the project?
These items will allow me to publish an original Black Box Story and provide my contributors with a tangible result.  I promised my contributors that I would provide them with a paperback copy and/or an e-book and that’s just what I’ll be able to do with this support. 

The website development is essential to marketing this project, creating a community around it, and providing a social media type of interaction for the community. This professional website will also not only provide information and sales of future publications, it will also keep readers current with upcoming events and insight into what I’m currently working on.

Copy editing is essential to any writers’ success. We get so wrapped up in our work that we fail to notice minor spelling errors or grammatical inconsistencies. Our completed work would not be as successful if a copy editor didn’t mark it all up first.
Every printed novel needs an eye-catching cover to draw in the interests of potential customers. For this aspect of the project, I would support an emerging local artist by commissioning them to design the cover and help them launch their career.

Need more reasons to donate??
Can’t find that perfect gift? Give someone the gift of immortality through words. Create a character based on or for them.
Is there someone in your life making it a living hell? Use the world of fiction to seek retribution. I’ll ensure justice is served on your behalf.
Maybe you really love your best friend... the cute, cuddly, always there when you get home best friend... your pet! Characters are not limited to humans.
Pay it forward! I’m a big fan of this concept. Ideally I would like to keep the project going in the future on an annual basis. New donors, new story and new emerging writer to help get noticed.

proposal, my readers also receive something else.  They get <i>instant access to a simple, ""meditative""
consciousness audio exercise, </i><span>that
I practice myself.  If they choose, readers can begin experiencing life changing,
mindful-consciousness beginning the very first day of reading my book.</span><i> </i><br/><br/>This experience provides a psychic defense against the daily pressures of life going forward. We naturally discover common
solutions to common problems like bad habits, anxiety, fear and stressed
emotions. It is as if we become <i>un-hypnotized</i>, released from a trance we didn’t
even know we were in.  We wake up . . .  <i>from the inside out! </i><br/><br/>All it takes is a few minutes each day to
practice it. It is
amazingly effective. It is fast acting. It is simple.<br/><p><br/></p>
<h3>Why I Am Doing This?</h3><p></p>Nearly everyone has untapped, inner
creativity waiting to be unleashed. By accessing simple consciousness,<br/><br/><ul><li>There is an instant release of new resourcefulness.</li></ul><ul><li>Intuition immediately elevates.</li></ul><ul><li>Obsessive needs diminish and fall away, purging the need to
indulge in harmful substances and behaviors. <br/>
</li></ul><ul><li>The world and the people around us
modify to accommodate our new state of being.</li></ul><ul>
<li>We maintain leverage in our personal
relationships as never before.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li><p>We cannot help but spill creative,
positive energy into the stream of life, influencing our present and future.</p></li>
<li>We become naturally virtuous in all our affairs.<br/>
</li>
</ul><p>What if more people would experience
this kind of lifestyle? Then each individual having a personal awakening
experience would extend that inner change outward, into the world around them.
It would form a natural, global collective of blessings.</p>

     amazed, absolutely stunned beyond belief!""- <b>Brad M. - Michigan, USA</b></i></li></ul>
<ul><li><i>“In the two weeks since faithfully doing the
     meditation, I now sleep restfully. I was smoking a pack a day and without
     thinking about it I am at half a pack and most times don't even care to. I
     am fully aware of my surroundings and especially those about me. The smile
     returned to my face immediately. Self-pity has slipped away. My work and
     profession are more enjoyable and when I am alone I am peaceful. Financial
     insecurity and worry about that ""stuff"" does not rule me.” 
     - <b>Bobby B. - Providence, RI</b></i></li></ul>
<ul><li><i>""Hey Danny. Things continue to improve as you say
     in ways I could never have imagined. This is the single most important
     practise in my life, without it, a return to self made misery... NO MORE.
     Grateful for your experience and your need to share this with the
     world."" <b>- Phil O. - Blackpool, England</b></i></li></ul>
<ul><li><i>“Awesome. I love your site. It has helped me so much
     through the years. Between you and my meetings and sponsorship I will be
     sober ten years in November even though I have been a member of AA for
     thirty years.” - <b>Deborah N. - Harbor Hts., WA</b></i></li></ul>
<ul><li><i>""I just wanted to say that the meditation is
     working so well, and like you said, there has been a change in my daughter
     also – WOW! is all I can say. Resentment no longer plays a part in my life,
     I choose not to entertain anger and resentment and feel an inner calmness. I
     thank you."" - <b>Charlotte M. - Edinburg, Scotland</b></i></li></ul>
<ul><li><i>""I just finished your meditation. I know something
     has changed... been freed. I just don't have the words. Just a sense of
     it...serenity. I am grateful that God works through all of us. Thank you
     Danny."" <b>Ed K. - USA</b></i></li></ul>
<ul><li><i>""Hi Danny thanxs for the meditation it’s changed
     my life."" - <b>Steven K.  - Liverpool, England</b></i></li></ul>
<ul><li><i>“Awesome! Where have you been all along? I've tried
     other forms of meditations to no avail. I just finished my first 20
     minutes of the Meditation Sampler. I have noticed the changes! I cannot
     thank you enough for your help! Peace and All Good!”  - <b>Don W. -
     Louisville, KY</b></i></li></ul>
<ul><li><i>“I have had a lower back problem dating back to 29
     years ago from which I have not had a single undisturbed night of sleep
     until making the meditation a part of my life. I now sleep well with no
     disturbance and I have even stopped my pain medication. This is a
     spiritual and psychic awakening. To say I am grateful is an
     understatement. What I owe you is beyond evaluation. Thanks.” - <b>Mark F.

     feeling of empathy instead of all the festering hate. There is hope and
     thank you again for sending that.” - <b>Deborah M. - Shaws Bend, TX</b></i></li></ul>
<ul><li><i>""Having been involved in Tibetan Buddhist
     meditation for years. I decided to try this meditation and cannot believe
     the shift that has occurred in my whole attitude, outlook and life in 2
     weeks. My husband and many friends have also been practicing it and are
     finding it powerful. I am amazed. I thank you for making this available to
     us. It's truly a gift."" <b>- Helen G. - Cornwall, England</b></i></li></ul>
<ul><li><i>“I've been doing the meditation on my own now for the
     last 3 weeks and I've also started reading your book. Though I am going
     through a divorce, a hard time with my new girlfriend and a difficult time
     at work with anxiety, I am feeling better and better by the day. I truly
     feel like I have conscious contact with God. It certainly works - I feel
     the change and people around me are noticing the change.""  <b>-
     John L. - Salt Lake, UT</b></i></li></ul>

     worked on my ability to watch and not identify with ego. I have only been
     at it a couple of weeks and I feel only just scratched the surface. Thank
     you Danny.” - <b>Pat C. - London, England</b></i></li></ul>

</blockquote><h3><b>""What
Is Needed?""</b></h3><p></p>
<p>Your contribution into this campaign
is not going to be used to pay me a wage while I write a book. That leg of this endeavor is already done. The cost of
printing and production of<b><i> </i></b><i>From The Inside Out</i> will be taken care
of by me, using my own resources, just as I did with my first book.</p>
<p>What your contribution <i>will</i>
do is something I <i>cannot </i>do on my own. It will help fund  key
marketing elements that are beyond production. These are tasks that must get
done to establish significant outreach and to get this message out. </p>
<p>Your contribution will be prudently
allocated toward (i) social media, (ii) technology, (iii) promotional
activities, including a modest reading-signing tour and (iv) final editing to
ensure that <i>From The Inside Out</i>  is the finest quality possible.</p>
<p></p><p><b>I will see to it that the tiny
mustard seed of your help amplifies an improvement of consciousness among
people all over the world. This is a book you will find personal contentment from knowing you
had a hand in getting out, believe me. </b></p>Please help me fan the sparks of
this avocation into a wildfire of consciousness that has already begun to alter
the courses of people's lives around the world.<br/><p><i><br/></i></p><h3><b></b></h3>
<h3><b>""Why
Should This Be Done?""<br/></b></h3>
<p>This is really, really important. We all live in stress packed environments. Over time the pressure exerts a
cumulative effect on us. Each time we fail to react properly in the stream of
life we sustain an alteration of psyche. This amounts to a shift in attitude and
is behind every known emotionally based mental, physical distress. <br/><br/></p><p>In a final analysis, at least 90% of all strife, poverty,
disease, war and every imaginable insanity and human misery can be linked to <i>unconsciousness</i>—people
not mindfully connected with their spiritual self. <br/><br/>Before it gets better we may witness
a frightening rise in violence, pandemic infections, and insanity. We will lose faith and trust in once magnanimous institutions and governments. Some of us will remain unharmed and will even <i>grow</i> spiritually
through these disturbing trends—those of us who are conscious and who remain undisturbed.  </p>
<i>From The Inside Out</i> is not a typical self-improvement proposition. With this
book we are venturing into the realm of metaphysics—addressing powerful forces
having an enormous impact on many people. <b><br/><br/>Mindfully aware people:</b> <p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Live mentally and physically robust
lives. <br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Are clear from the debilitating
effects of negative emotions and are free from fear.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Develop a powerful immunity to
stress and the deleterious effects of obsessive behavior and thinking. <br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Are not stepping on the toes of their fellows causing harms wherever they go.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Don’t make strings of poor life decisions. <br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Have solid, enriching relationships
with others—whether romantic, family, business or social.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Are free from morbid habits like overeating, over-sexing,
smoking, drinking and drugging. <br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Exhibit intuitive discipline from within, without
emotional encumbrance, making our way peacefully and confidently on the path of
life. </li>
</ul><p></p>

<p></p></div>","From the Inside Out is a spiritual guide taking the reader beyond spiritual theory, showing precisely how to simply access “Consciousness."" Along with a nine-point daily life
proposal, my readers also receive something else.  They get instant access to a simple, ""meditative""
consciousness audio exercise, that
I practice myself.  If they choose, readers can begin experiencing life changing,
mindful-consciousness beginning the very first day of reading my book. This experience provides a psychic defense against the daily pressures of life going forward. We naturally discover common
solutions to common problems like bad habits, anxiety, fear and stressed
emotions. It is as if we become un-hypnotized, released from a trance we didn’t
even know we were in.  We wake up . . .  from the inside out! All it takes is a few minutes each day to
practice it. It is
amazingly effective. It is fast acting. It is simple.
Why I Am Doing This?Nearly everyone has untapped, inner
creativity waiting to be unleashed. By accessing simple consciousness,There is an instant release of new resourcefulness.Intuition immediately elevates.Obsessive needs diminish and fall away, purging the need to
indulge in harmful substances and behaviors. 
The world and the people around us
modify to accommodate our new state of being.
We maintain leverage in our personal
relationships as never before.

We cannot help but spill creative,
positive energy into the stream of life, influencing our present and future.
We become naturally virtuous in all our affairs.

What if more people would experience
this kind of lifestyle? Then each individual having a personal awakening
experience would extend that inner change outward, into the world around them.
It would form a natural, global collective of blessings.

This is the kind of world I want my
children to live in. It's the world I want to live in. I am pretty sure you do too. 
The manuscript for this special book
is written and will be published within weeks from the ending date of this
campaign, in time for Christmas.Who Am I?My name is Dan Schwarzhoff. I am the
author but also a “veteran” practitioner, with over thirty years living and
teaching Mindfully Conscious Contact to others exactly as described in my
books. For the last fifteen years I've been writing about this way of life.Here are some sample bites of what people have had to say:

""Oh my God! The aha moments keep coming. I am
     amazed, absolutely stunned beyond belief!""- Brad M. - Michigan, USA
“In the two weeks since faithfully doing the
     meditation, I now sleep restfully. I was smoking a pack a day and without
     thinking about it I am at half a pack and most times don't even care to. I
     am fully aware of my surroundings and especially those about me. The smile
     returned to my face immediately. Self-pity has slipped away. My work and
     profession are more enjoyable and when I am alone I am peaceful. Financial
     insecurity and worry about that ""stuff"" does not rule me.” 
     - Bobby B. - Providence, RI
""Hey Danny. Things continue to improve as you say
     in ways I could never have imagined. This is the single most important
     practise in my life, without it, a return to self made misery... NO MORE.
     Grateful for your experience and your need to share this with the
     world."" - Phil O. - Blackpool, England
“Awesome. I love your site. It has helped me so much
     through the years. Between you and my meetings and sponsorship I will be
     sober ten years in November even though I have been a member of AA for
     thirty years.” - Deborah N. - Harbor Hts., WA
""I just wanted to say that the meditation is
     working so well, and like you said, there has been a change in my daughter
     also – WOW! is all I can say. Resentment no longer plays a part in my life,
     I choose not to entertain anger and resentment and feel an inner calmness. I
     thank you."" - Charlotte M. - Edinburg, Scotland
""I just finished your meditation. I know something
     has changed... been freed. I just don't have the words. Just a sense of
     it...serenity. I am grateful that God works through all of us. Thank you
     Danny."" Ed K. - USA
""Hi Danny thanxs for the meditation it’s changed
     my life."" - Steven K.  - Liverpool, England
“Awesome! Where have you been all along? I've tried
     other forms of meditations to no avail. I just finished my first 20
     minutes of the Meditation Sampler. I have noticed the changes! I cannot
     thank you enough for your help! Peace and All Good!”  - Don W. -
     Louisville, KY
“I have had a lower back problem dating back to 29
     years ago from which I have not had a single undisturbed night of sleep
     until making the meditation a part of my life. I now sleep well with no
     disturbance and I have even stopped my pain medication. This is a
     spiritual and psychic awakening. To say I am grateful is an
     understatement. What I owe you is beyond evaluation. Thanks.” - Mark F.
     - NSW, AU
“It has given back hope, which I had lost. I had
     feeling of empathy instead of all the festering hate. There is hope and
     thank you again for sending that.” - Deborah M. - Shaws Bend, TX
""Having been involved in Tibetan Buddhist
     meditation for years. I decided to try this meditation and cannot believe
     the shift that has occurred in my whole attitude, outlook and life in 2
     weeks. My husband and many friends have also been practicing it and are
     finding it powerful. I am amazed. I thank you for making this available to
     us. It's truly a gift."" - Helen G. - Cornwall, England
“I've been doing the meditation on my own now for the
     last 3 weeks and I've also started reading your book. Though I am going
     through a divorce, a hard time with my new girlfriend and a difficult time
     at work with anxiety, I am feeling better and better by the day. I truly
     feel like I have conscious contact with God. It certainly works - I feel
     the change and people around me are noticing the change.""  -
     John L. - Salt Lake, UT
“I am absolutely amazed at how quick the meditation has
     worked on my ability to watch and not identify with ego. I have only been
     at it a couple of weeks and I feel only just scratched the surface. Thank
     you Danny.” - Pat C. - London, England
""Just wanted to drop a line to thank you for the
     meditation. My whole outlook has been taken to a whole new level since I
     started it, so thank you very much. I have turned others onto your link
     and they are seeing results as well."" - Scott S. - Taylor, MI
""After I found your FB page, read your book, and
     did your meditation, I had a spiritual awakening. What I experienced is so
     hard to describe, but I feel through that experience and through my
     continued conscious contact with God, I am recovered."" - Kelly T.
     - Hartford, Ct. 
Each of these testimonials is 100%
unsolicited.
""What
Is Needed?""
Your contribution into this campaign
is not going to be used to pay me a wage while I write a book. That leg of this endeavor is already done. The cost of
printing and production of From The Inside Out will be taken care
of by me, using my own resources, just as I did with my first book.
What your contribution will
do is something I cannot do on my own. It will help fund  key
marketing elements that are beyond production. These are tasks that must get
done to establish significant outreach and to get this message out. 
Your contribution will be prudently
allocated toward (i) social media, (ii) technology, (iii) promotional
activities, including a modest reading-signing tour and (iv) final editing to
ensure that From The Inside Out  is the finest quality possible.
I will see to it that the tiny
mustard seed of your help amplifies an improvement of consciousness among
people all over the world. This is a book you will find personal contentment from knowing you
had a hand in getting out, believe me. Please help me fan the sparks of
this avocation into a wildfire of consciousness that has already begun to alter
the courses of people's lives around the world.
""Why
Should This Be Done?""
This is really, really important. We all live in stress packed environments. Over time the pressure exerts a
cumulative effect on us. Each time we fail to react properly in the stream of
life we sustain an alteration of psyche. This amounts to a shift in attitude and
is behind every known emotionally based mental, physical distress. In a final analysis, at least 90% of all strife, poverty,
disease, war and every imaginable insanity and human misery can be linked to unconsciousness—people
not mindfully connected with their spiritual self. Before it gets better we may witness
a frightening rise in violence, pandemic infections, and insanity. We will lose faith and trust in once magnanimous institutions and governments. Some of us will remain unharmed and will even grow spiritually
through these disturbing trends—those of us who are conscious and who remain undisturbed.  
From The Inside Out is not a typical self-improvement proposition. With this
book we are venturing into the realm of metaphysics—addressing powerful forces
having an enormous impact on many people. Mindfully aware people: 


Live mentally and physically robust
lives. 


Are clear from the debilitating
effects of negative emotions and are free from fear.


Develop a powerful immunity to
stress and the deleterious effects of obsessive behavior and thinking. 


Are not stepping on the toes of their fellows causing harms wherever they go.


Don’t make strings of poor life decisions. 


Have solid, enriching relationships
with others—whether romantic, family, business or social.


Are free from morbid habits like overeating, over-sexing,
smoking, drinking and drugging. 


Exhibit intuitive discipline from within, without
emotional encumbrance, making our way peacefully and confidently on the path of
life. 

""What
Will This Look Like?"" 
The website is going to be slammin’. Not only will it distribute
books but also mp3’s and other free downloads. Readers will also be able to
connect with each other and share their life changing experiences as the result
of my book through a discussion board. They will have easy access to my blogs
and any new videos I make. It’ll also capture emails for a
newsletter signup and there will be a high-end shopping mall where I can always
add new publications and recordings. 
The Mobile App will allow readers to have easier access to the Consciousness Exercise and materials—on the fly, so to speak. Anytime during the day where there are
dangers of dreaming or becoming mesmerized by life, a subscriber can easily
practice waking up.
Promotion – A lion’s share (over 40%) of your contribution
goes toward activities communicating the message of consciousness. This will
include social media integration and public relations activities such as
issuing press releases, making public appearances like book signings and
engaging local, national and international (UK) broadcast interviews on
television, radio and webcasts—as well as print media interviews in
newspapers, magazines and online publications. 
Editing – A final work-over will appraise the quality of “From the
Inside Out” prior to being published through ""CreateSpace"". A
professional will be contracted to provide a final assessment of the
manuscript, adjusting for style standards to ensure its strength.""When
Will The Book Be Released?""
Anticipating late Fall and in time for Christmas
2014, “From the Inside Out” will be available on Amazon, Kindle, Barnes &
Noble and Nook—as well as through an expanded distribution network of
booksellers, schools and libraries throughout the U.S. and most of Europe.Breaking

Personal Note:  I am not a
clinician. I am spiritual “practitioner”. I  approach problems from a 
metaphysical perspective, which is why I am so successful. My work is 
predicated upon the simple
truth that once the spirit heals, both mind and body follow. However, no
 one
need take my word for it. I can prove it. You may access documented 
evidence of
miraculous physical and mental healing through God-Consciousness. You

<p>

<p>
</p><p><i>HEALING STORY</i></p>
<p><i>About 7 years ago I hurt my back really badly at work by lifting people I was caring for. I suffered for 5 years with a lot of pain, and I had to take medication every day. As a result of the long-term pain my body also developed depression. I decided to go for a retreat and God spoke to me about healing of my pain. I couldn't imagine how that could happen because I had tried so many treatments and types of medication. After the retreat I went back home to Kelniky for a holiday and met with a priest, who prayed for my healing. Accidentally I did not take enough pain relief medication for the duration of my holiday. Without that medication the pain would usually cause me to shake and feel physically sick. I would hardly be able to move, and I wouldn't be able sleep. When I returned back from holiday to the UK after two weeks I realized my back pain was gone! It was hard to believe and understand what had happened. I put all my medication into the bin and said I do not need any medication I need Jesus! :) My life has changed! I am able to dance again, skate, cycle, run, walk, socialize and smile! :)     </i></p>
<p>
</p><p>So now that I’m able to do all these things I’ve decided to go to finally go to Africa! To Uganda, to be precise, where I can serve people in the way I’ve been inspired to! </p>
<p>WHY I’M GOING ON THIS TRIP   -  to make difference in the world, to serve one another, to make new friends, to build self-esteem, to develop my skills, new experience, help people, feel needed and appreciated, share life with others, to have a fun, to do something different, to know God and Make Him known.</p>

Jones and he represents The Warrior Heart Magazine team of Editors.  He is also a Best-Selling Author and subject of an Emmy Award winning news story based on overcoming his struggles with PTSD and the release of his book, Healing the Warrior Heart.  </span><br/></p>
<p>The entire team is comprised of Veterans from the Army and Marine Corps as well as one of the greatest Veteran supporters they have ever come to know.  Each one of them provides a unique touch to the magazine and is highly dedicated to seeing the success of the mission, which is: </p>
<p>To give military service members and veterans a creative outlet to process combat exposure and the ability to present their opinions on current events in a way that bridges the gap between civilians and veterans by gaining a much needed understanding of one another.  </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary The Warrior Heart Magazine is a magazine focused on sharing poems, short stories, articles and interviews about military service members, veterans and their loved ones.  The Editor-In-Chief is Marine Corps Combat Veteran Andrew R. Jones and he represents The Warrior Heart Magazine team of Editors.  He is also a Best-Selling Author and subject of an Emmy Award winning news story based on overcoming his struggles with PTSD and the release of his book, Healing the Warrior Heart.  
The entire team is comprised of Veterans from the Army and Marine Corps as well as one of the greatest Veteran supporters they have ever come to know.  Each one of them provides a unique touch to the magazine and is highly dedicated to seeing the success of the mission, which is: 
To give military service members and veterans a creative outlet to process combat exposure and the ability to present their opinions on current events in a way that bridges the gap between civilians and veterans by gaining a much needed understanding of one another.  
The Vision:

to get funding for my first major project as an author. The full title of the

so that they can move on in life. When you help me get this dream campaign
funded you will be contributing to me chasing one of my dreams which was to

The Story So Far ...


We are very, very close to completing Little Girl and The Hill - a hand-illustrated, children's e-book about the dangers of chasing perfection.This book was born from our own experiences with perfectionism, and the hope that a simple story could teach others how to embrace the present moment and enjoy more of what is - not just what could be.Help Us Publish Little Girl and The HillAll of the funds we raise will go toward getting the book into final production, and published and distributed through Graphicly.The funding breakdown:
$150 for book production/distribution
$125 for purchasing an ISBN 

$300 for hiring a copy editor

Anything over our fundraising will goal will initially help us expand our promotional strategy, but if we manage to raise $1000 or more over our goal, we'll apply the funds to the formatting, design and production costs to publish a kick ass print version of the book.Other Ways You Can SupportIf you'd like to support this project but can't donate to the cause, you can help us a ton by simply sharing our campaign using the Indiegogo share tools above.The Impact When Amber and I launched We Craft Stories, we had no idea what to expect from the journey.We were two artists who had neglected our work for years out of fear - stalling and waiting for the right time or right inspiration to swoop down and carry us to the desk.Now we're pushing ahead - leaning into that great unknown. Your support will empower us to take that final step and turn what once was a distant goal into reality.Thank you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Todo funciona mediante un sistema robótico controlado y cerrado que proporciona choques térmicos a temperaturas extremas en un tiempo muy corto. El choque choque térmico es controlado mediante un sistema que en ningún momento tiene contacto con la leche por lo que no es contaminada durante el proceso. Durante el procedimiento se utiliza como referencia y retroalimentación de temperaturas al sistema, un fluido con densidad, punto de ebullición y fusión igual a la leche materna para no desperdiciar el líquido.<br/></p>

<p>Everything works using a
controlled and closed robotic system that provides thermal shocks to extreme
temperatures in a very short time. The thermal shock is controlled by a system which
never has contact with the milk, so it is not contaminated during the process.
In the procedure, a fluid with density, and boiling and melting point
same as those of the breast milk are used as a reference and
feedback of temperatures of the system for not to wastthe liquid.</p>

only inactivates the CMV, but also that preserves nutrients and
antibodies that babies need. Currently, we have designed the device; however,
we need your support to make the prototype and demonstrate that this method is
much better than the traditional one.





¿Cómo funciona el equipo ultrapasteurizador? /

How does ultra-pasteurizer equipment work?
Todo funciona mediante un sistema robótico controlado y cerrado que proporciona choques térmicos a temperaturas extremas en un tiempo muy corto. El choque choque térmico es controlado mediante un sistema que en ningún momento tiene contacto con la leche por lo que no es contaminada durante el proceso. Durante el procedimiento se utiliza como referencia y retroalimentación de temperaturas al sistema, un fluido con densidad, punto de ebullición y fusión igual a la leche materna para no desperdiciar el líquido.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Everything works using a
controlled and closed robotic system that provides thermal shocks to extreme
temperatures in a very short time. The thermal shock is controlled by a system which
never has contact with the milk, so it is not contaminated during the process.
In the procedure, a fluid with density, and boiling and melting point
same as those of the breast milk are used as a reference and
feedback of temperatures of the system for not to wastthe liquid.




Ultra-pasteurizador: Uno de los principales obstáculos es la financiación / Ultra-pasteurizer: One of the major obstacles is funding



El ultrapasteurizador de leche materna es una iniciativa que hemos emprendido egresados del Instituto Politécnico Nacional en México en colaboración con expertos en el tema y ha sido financiado con recursos propios a través de ""freelance"", sin embargo, nos encontramos en una etapa en donde es necesario invertir más recursos para fabricar el primer prototipo piloto.
Hemos planeado tanto como sea posible para el exito de este proyecto. El siguiente paso importante es recaudar los fondos necesarios para adquirir los dispositivos y material necesario para el prototipado y realizar las primeras pruebas beta para evaluar el desempeño y la calidad de la leche materna después del proceso.
Para el primer prototipo requerimos recaudar $40,000 dólares que serán destinados para materiales, herramientas y pruebas clínicas microbiológicas, virológicas, entre otros estudios.

The
ultra- pasteurizer breast milk is an initiative that we, graduates from the
Instituto Politécnico Nacional in Mexico, have undertaken in collaboration with
experts in the field. The project has been financed with our own resources through
""freelance""; however, we are at a stage where it is necessary to invest
more resources to manufacture the first pilot prototype.
We
have planned as much as possible to the success of this project. The next important
step is to raise the necessary funds to acquire the devices and equipment for prototyping
and make the first beta testing to evaluate the performance and quality of
breast milk after the process.
For
the first prototype, we need to raise $40,000 dollars which will be used for materials,
tools, microbiological and virological clinical tests, among other studies.

<h3>The Story of My Book</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Fired up about the next ten years of climate activism? </p>
<p>Amused or frustrated at #OkBoomer? </p>
<p>Looking for unity in what is proving to be a challenging decade? </p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Growing Up in the Grassroots: Finding Unity in Climate Activism Across Generations</i> is my take on “Generation Greta” and what it means to be a climate advocate in the 21st-century’s New Environmental Movement. I wrote it to share <strong>why all generations are needed at the table to contribute meaningful solutions to climate change. </strong>With your help, the book will publish in July 2020. #GrowingUpInTheGrassroots</p>
<p>My name is Joy Reeves and I am the author of Growing Up in the Grassroots. I wrote this book because it is my peace offering — my personal contribution to the widespread, exasperated push for unity we’re seeing in the divided United States right now. There is a lot of rightful anger coming from my generation, Gen Z, towards other generations on the topic of climate change (“Ok, Boomer”), as well as frustration directed back at us for our hypersensitivity (“Ok, Snowflake”). Neither one of these generalized attacks accurately captures how most of us want to work together... or how little time we have to do so.</p>
<p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that there are vast opportunities for older and younger generations to find common ground, and room for mentorship, to move forward collaboratively on climate change. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for climate advocacy in you. Much of it comes from a comprehensive understanding of U.S. environmental history which is unfortunately skimmed over in many primary-classroom settings. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you master science communication for audiences of all ages and backgrounds.</p>
<p>In this book, you'll learn about climate advocacy and how different generations are involved in it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Chlöe Swarbrick </strong>- a New Zealand parliamentarian, and Millennial, who challenges older politicians on climate action and inadvertently sparks an online movement.<br/> </li>
<li><p><strong>Bob Inglis</strong> - A 61-year-old Republican politician and father who radically changed his views on climate change after a spiritual experience in nature and a conversation with his son.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>“The Raging Grannies”</strong> - A troupe of elderly activists across the globe that you may stumble across singing hilarious protest songs...but completely defying the “little old lady” stereotype in the rest of their story.<br/> </p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are an environmental geek like me...or if you’re simply a teen or adult who considers yourself at least a little bit “woke” to environmental activism. Whether you’re hitting the ground chasing social media fame as a Gen-Z/Millennial, reflecting on a lifetime of environmental science work as a Gen-X/Baby Boomer, or are still a little confused about why there are kids blocking the street, this book is great for you if this planet’s future has been on your mind.</p>
<p><br/>Growing Up in the Grassroots is a non-fiction book that speaks to anyone who thinks about the next 50 years of climate change and gets mildly worried, particularly impassioned students and supportive adults interested in looking at climate activism and intergenerational unity for the first time.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Book - <i>Growing Up in the Grassroots</i>
</h3>
<p><br/>The book is written in three parts:<br/><br/><strong>Part I: Planting the Grassroots</strong><br/>Introduction + Chapters 1-3 give an overview of the “How We Got Here.” From the first Earth Day to the latest #FridaysForFuture strike, this chapter explores the progression of not only climate change but of the larger Environmental Movement as it reawakens in the image of courageous youth.<br/><br/><strong>Part II: Common Ground</strong><br/>Chapters 4-10 delve into the common environmental values that have always united Americans. These include care for our children, pride in our National Parks, excitement towards outdoor recreation, stewardship of nature, love for meaningful music, empathy towards loss, and many more topics that transcend generational and partisan divides. Part II integrates the voices of climate academics as well as bipartisan leaders to unpack where successful communication lies.<br/><br/><strong>Part III: How to Talk <u>With</u> Others About Climate Change</strong><br/>Chapters 11-14 provide talking points and applicable strategies to have the most productive conversations on climate change. How do I bring up the environment to different generational audiences? How do I learn to depolarize myself when I feel there are so many urgent issues at stake? Part III addresses these questions and features advice from science communication experts as well as my personal encounters to demystify the art of productive climate communication.</p>

<h3>Inside Gamergate</h3>
<p>Hello there.</p>
<p>My name is James 'Grim' Desborough. I was involved in Gamergate since before it was Gamergate and remained involved all the way through - right up until it began to sputter out.<br/><br/>I am a tabletop game designer and writer with a keen interest in history, politics and the story of what you might call 'geek media'.</p>
<p>I'm old enough to remember The Satanic Panic and the PMRC, old enough to remember Jack Thompson's crusade against violent video games. I've researched and read about previous moral panics, such as Wertham's 'Seduction of the Innocent' in the comics world, and I see the conflict between 'SJWs' and 'Gamergate' (and its legacy) very much in the paradigm of these previous panics and fights.</p>
<p>Having been part of Gamergate, through all its highs and lows, I am worried - now - with censorship on platforms like Wikipedia and with books and campaigns by the 'victims' of Gamergate that this event will go into the history books with a very one-sided, lopsided and biased view of what happened - and why.</p>
<p>As a historian this concerns me, as a Gamergater this concerns me, as someone who cares about truth that concerns me. It's important to me, and it should be important to everyone, that this event goes into the historical record with a complete and rounded view.</p>
<p>You can help make that happen.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm after a base amount of money to, basically, pay my 'wage' for two months to complete this project. This will give me the space and security to pursue writing this, along with enough room for people to suggest contributions and to help with aspects of research. That's the other, main thing I need - community buy in.</p>
<p>What you get is a chance to help me enter into the record a comprehensive - but personal and approachable - guide to the events of Gamergate from Gamergate's perspective.</p>
<p>I think it's important to have a personal and perspective-led view as a counter to 'Literally Who's' forthcoming book which will have its own, extremely biased perspective, well divorced from reality, but fitting the existing media narrative.#</p>
<p>Journalist Brad Glasgow is working on a Gamergate book himself, but it promises to be more of a statistic-led, neutral viewpoint. I think we need something else to counter the perspective of the anti-Gamergate people.</p>
<p>Additional funding will go towards art and editing, to create a better final product.</p>
<p>If we get to $1,500 I'll commission an original cover. If we get to $2,000 I'll shell out for a full, professional edit.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is a real opportunity to tell the story of Gamergate from inside Gamergate. To record its perspective, through me, on key events and controversies. To explain why gamers were so pissed off and to place it in its proper context. To explain to 'normies' (reeeee) how Chans work, what Trolling actually is and the value of rare Pepes.</p>
<p>Do you want Gamergate to continue to be a black mark against people, even though it 'dindu nuffin'? Do you want to be dismissed as a bunch of 'internet thugs' and to be gamedropped every time someone wants to say something bad about the internet space? Do you want to be used as an excuse to censor and control online spaces or do you want an alternative out there that explains our point of view? Do you want people to ignorantly call you racist, sexist or whatever else, because they can't detect irony, sarcasm or keep up with memes?</p>
<p>This isn't my first rodeo on crowdfunded projects and I have a 100% success rate - sometimes late, but never failed. This book WILL happen, especially since it's all on me. It just needs you to help fund it</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There's a number of things that could get in the way of immediate success and it's good to be up front about them.</p>
<p>1. I suffer from depression. This means, sometimes, I can be knocked out for days, weeks, even a month at a time. This hasn't happened in a couple of years now - the months - but I do still have low days and even suicidal ideation. This is not to elicit sympathy, but just to warn you that it can cause delays. I am medicated but medication for depression is a two-edged sword, while it can make you functional it can dent creativity, so you're always adjusting to try and maximise both. It sucks. As it happens, that depression is another reason I really want to write this, I had a bout of suicidal behaviour during Gamergate and it was people within Gamergate who came together to make sure I was OK. They may have saved my life.<br/><br/>2. The more time passes the harder it is to find and filter information about the events of Gamergate. With so much of it happening on ephemeral social media such as Twitter and with censorship running rampant, many accounts - and their interactions - are deleted. This will make research etc rather challenging. While I'm going for a 'gonzo' PoV style, I'd still like to back up with information and links where possible. I'll need community help on research.</p>
<p>3. Attempts to publish material about Gamergate, games for example, have met with censorship and downlisting before. This shouldn't happen on a platform like Amazon - where we would likely, ultimately, be selling the book but it is a potential issue on other sales platforms.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Spread the word.</p>
<p>Help me research.</p>
<p>With other books coming out, while I'm passionate about this project I'm going to be busy for a while and unable to really promote this fundraiser. That means it's down to you if you want to see it happen. Share the shit out of it, talk about it, talk to me if you believe in the project and feel me out about it.</p>
<p>Given the sheer scope of Gamergate and the difficulty from so much of it happening on social media I'm also going to need help researching the various events and parts of it. That's another important way you can help - even if you can't donate.</p>
<p>Given that there are other books on this forthcoming it won't be the absolute end of the world if this book doesn't happen, but I do think it's important that we have a personal viewpoint from within the movement alongside the other material that's forthcoming.</p>
<p>I may not be the absolute best person to do it, but I'm up there. I have the writing chops, I have the historical and political perspective, I understand how it fits into a broader social and historical framework.</p>
<p>I think I can do you proud.</p>

What you get is a chance to help me enter into the record a comprehensive - but personal and approachable - guide to the events of Gamergate from Gamergate's perspective.
I think it's important to have a personal and perspective-led view as a counter to 'Literally Who's' forthcoming book which will have its own, extremely biased perspective, well divorced from reality, but fitting the existing media narrative.#
Journalist Brad Glasgow is working on a Gamergate book himself, but it promises to be more of a statistic-led, neutral viewpoint. I think we need something else to counter the perspective of the anti-Gamergate people.
Additional funding will go towards art and editing, to create a better final product.
If we get to $1,500 I'll commission an original cover. If we get to $2,000 I'll shell out for a full, professional edit.

The Impact
This is a real opportunity to tell the story of Gamergate from inside Gamergate. To record its perspective, through me, on key events and controversies. To explain why gamers were so pissed off and to place it in its proper context. To explain to 'normies' (reeeee) how Chans work, what Trolling actually is and the value of rare Pepes.
Do you want Gamergate to continue to be a black mark against people, even though it 'dindu nuffin'? Do you want to be dismissed as a bunch of 'internet thugs' and to be gamedropped every time someone wants to say something bad about the internet space? Do you want to be used as an excuse to censor and control online spaces or do you want an alternative out there that explains our point of view? Do you want people to ignorantly call you racist, sexist or whatever else, because they can't detect irony, sarcasm or keep up with memes?
This isn't my first rodeo on crowdfunded projects and I have a 100% success rate - sometimes late, but never failed. This book WILL happen, especially since it's all on me. It just needs you to help fund it

Risks & Challenges
There's a number of things that could get in the way of immediate success and it's good to be up front about them.
1. I suffer from depression. This means, sometimes, I can be knocked out for days, weeks, even a month at a time. This hasn't happened in a couple of years now - the months - but I do still have low days and even suicidal ideation. This is not to elicit sympathy, but just to warn you that it can cause delays. I am medicated but medication for depression is a two-edged sword, while it can make you functional it can dent creativity, so you're always adjusting to try and maximise both. It sucks. As it happens, that depression is another reason I really want to write this, I had a bout of suicidal behaviour during Gamergate and it was people within Gamergate who came together to make sure I was OK. They may have saved my life.2. The more time passes the harder it is to find and filter information about the events of Gamergate. With so much of it happening on ephemeral social media such as Twitter and with censorship running rampant, many accounts - and their interactions - are deleted. This will make research etc rather challenging. While I'm going for a 'gonzo' PoV style, I'd still like to back up with information and links where possible. I'll need community help on research.
3. Attempts to publish material about Gamergate, games for example, have met with censorship and downlisting before. This shouldn't happen on a platform like Amazon - where we would likely, ultimately, be selling the book but it is a potential issue on other sales platforms.

Other Ways You Can Help
Spread the word.
Help me research.
With other books coming out, while I'm passionate about this project I'm going to be busy for a while and unable to really promote this fundraiser. That means it's down to you if you want to see it happen. Share the shit out of it, talk about it, talk to me if you believe in the project and feel me out about it.
Given the sheer scope of Gamergate and the difficulty from so much of it happening on social media I'm also going to need help researching the various events and parts of it. That's another important way you can help - even if you can't donate.
Given that there are other books on this forthcoming it won't be the absolute end of the world if this book doesn't happen, but I do think it's important that we have a personal viewpoint from within the movement alongside the other material that's forthcoming.
I may not be the absolute best person to do it, but I'm up there. I have the writing chops, I have the historical and political perspective, I understand how it fits into a broader social and historical framework.
I think I can do you proud.",0.0,0,"11 Campaigns

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>For reasons I can't quite locate or explain, my awakening on the climate crisis occurred slowly and relatively late in my political awakening.</p>
<p>I am indeed part and parcel of the mainstream of generations since the US civil rights movement, whose political concerns encompassed deep awareness of social injustice.  And I share Gen X, millennial, and Z generations' regard for the environment and concerns about a changing climate.  Through work in sustainable city planning at the Mayor's Office of Operations in New York City and reading about accumulating dangers, I began to see the signal to act with even more urgency than I had in the past to dislodge our domestic politics and the international system's stagnancy. </p>
<p>As David Wallace-Wells describes artfully in his book <i>The Uninhabitable Earth</i>, in just the last 30 years, or about the entirety of my life, over half of the humanities' contributions to greenhouse gases were emitted.  That is, in all the hundreds of millennia before, and again in the last thirty years, we have shifted the earth's planetary system drastically off balance and onto a dangerous and lethal course.</p>
<p>Indeed, as he writes:  ""Global warming, in other words, is more than just one input in an equation to determine carrying capacity; it is the set of conditions under which all of our experiments to improve that capacity will be conducted. In this way, climate change appears to be not merely one challenge among may facing a planet already struggling with civil strife and war and horrifying inequality and far too many other insoluble hardships to iterate, but the all-encompassing stage on which all those challenges will be met—a whole sphere in other words, which literally contains within it all of the worlds' future problems and all of its possible solutions."" (Wallace-Wells p. 53)</p>
<p>What also accompanies this personal awareness is the collective awakening of the precarity of our already troubled present with crises in democracy in the US and racism and moral disregard. This book project prompts us to take the challenges revealed by the coronavirus crisis and concurrent tests to US democracy as fuel to meet the still possible opportunities to divert our future climate and democratic courses.</p>
<p>This book will be a vehicle for seeing the obstacles that threaten climate progress in American politics and the international system, based in my perspective shaped by many years of graduate research, policy planning, reading, and writing. In a time of racial unrest, it is also a chance to invest in a first-time author of color, whose intention is to make his hand accessible to those who do not have a completed college education.</p>
<p>Through its accessible reading level considerations and Spanish language translation, the author hopes to shape the book's content presentation for the broadest range of audiences of interested readers.</p>
<p>The book will also be a primer for understanding US politics in the 2020s because no intimate knowledge of climate change, US culture, or international politics is presumed. After reading <i>Marathon</i>, I hope the audience of readers will better see and have the transnational frameworks to contextualize systems of governance and domestic political opportunities for climate and democratic progress.</p>

<h3>Short Summary: Author</h3>
<ul>
<li>Author, Darius Callier, 30, threads together cultural theory, developments in American politics, climate science policy, political economy, social policy, and international relations. His writing agenda is hybridized in two senses: its interdisciplinary reach and its language stylization at a broadly accessible reading level. Both dimmensions connect an audience of those who read journalism regularly and those who follow politics as a hobby to academics engaged in data analysis, research and theory.</li>
<li>Darius works as a freelance writer, education consultant, writing coach, and health and economic policy research assistant at Georgetown Law School Center's Economic Security and Opportunity Initiative. Previously, he served as a policy analyst for project management at New York City's Mayor's Office of Operations, and performed policy analysis, improved management processes, implemented local legislation, liased with state and federal government, and shaped policy implementation on initiatives pertaining to public health, housing and homelessness, economic development, sustainability, and climate adaptation.</li>
<li>Darius holds a B.A. from Lehigh University in Philosophy and Political Science, studied in the Development Management and Policy dual graduate program at Georgetown University, Universidad Nacional de San Martin (Buenos Aires, Argentina), and is preparing a graduate thesis in international political economy and comparative social policy for defense in December 2020.

It is for you and for me and for all of us who are in process and need a new way to experience Jesus.  It is for all of us who have ever picked up the Bible and wanted more context and information because it can be hard to understand.  Timshel is for those of us who believe that Scripture is alive and beautiful and want to find new meaning inside of it.  It is a new way to read the Bible that sets the stage for creative interpretation, questions, wrestling and dialogue.</p><p>The Bible is about what it means to be human and how God interacts with us along the journey.  </p><p>When I preach and speak at churches, I dive deep into the text we are discussing and look at it from every angle: the historical and cultural background, word studies in the original language, commentaries on the passage at hand, the way the passage fits within the whole Biblical narrative, and the literary genre of the book.  Looking at all these different parts of the text allows us to understand the text and the characters through a deeper dimension, by understanding how their lives and circumstances affected them on a very personal level.  </p><p>Each time I share the passages through this new lens, people always tell me it was ""something they never heard before"" or that it ""woke something up inside of them.""  I believe that the Bible has something to say to all of us, but not just how we are to live.  </p><p>The Bible is a collection of poems, letters, and stories of different literary genres that have historical data, and meaning found in the original language. Timshel translation combines these intellectual disciplines with the historical and cultural vernacular. Timshel brings out the emotions, thoughts, struggles, triumphs, and psychological journeys that the Biblical characters are going through.  These efforts create a Bible translation in which readers can find a point of connection to their own inner journeys and personhood.</p><h2><strong>The Product and the Process</strong></h2><p>Timshel translation is a collection of 20 different Bible passages translated in a whole new way.  To mirror the beauty and depth of the Bible itself, we have decided to print this translation to be beautiful and aesthetically pleasing.  </p><p>Designer and artist, Katie Noel, who designed our logo, will also be creating a limited edition book cover.  Her design will be foil stamped as seen in the mockup:</p><p>The softcover editions will include the exclusively designed book cover, foil stamped and expertly put together.  The cover and pages are of finest quality and the dimension of the book reflect that of a novel so that it is easy to carry with you. </p><p>The hardcover edition of the book will include the exclusively designed cover foil stamped on hand-woven linen fabric.  The cover and pages are of finest quality and the dimension of the book reflect that of a novel so that it is easy to carry with you. Each book is expertly sewn and handmade. </p><p>Each of these editions will also include limited edition 20 pieces of artwork on colored, glossy paper, that reflect the new themes of each story found in Timshel.  </p><p>If this project gets fully funded, I will be translating the following 20  passages* of the Bible:</p><h3>Old Testament</h3><p> Creation: Genesis 2-3</p><p> Tower of Babel: Genesis 11</p><p> Binding of Isaac: Genesis 22:1-23:2</p><p> The Exodus: Exodus 7:1-14:31</p><p> Ruth</p><p>Psalm 23 </p><p>Proverbs 31</p><p>The Land of Dry Bones: Ezekiel 37:1-5</p><p>Death of Moses</p><p>Jonah</p><h3>New Testament: </h3><p> Parable of the Talents: Matthew 25:14-30</p><p> Word Became Flesh: John 1:1-18</p><p> Nicodemus: John 3:1-21 </p><p> Jesus Anointed by a Sinful Woman: Luke 7:36-50</p><p> Mary and Martha: Luke 10:38-42 </p><p> Jesus and the Syrophonecian Woman</p><p>Beatitudes</p><p>Jesus Heals the Bleeding Woman</p><p>Philippians 2:5-7</p><p> Death and Resurrection of Jesus: Matthew 27-28, Mark 15-16, Luke 22-24, John 18-21</p><p>*The exact verses of these passages are subject to change, and due to the literary genre of some passages, not all verses will be translated directly, or as in the case for the Birth of Jesus narrative, more than one book will be combined to form a more complete angle.  </p><p>I will be doing the translating, but will be working with a Psychologist and Creative writer, Kyle Horst, as well as professional editor, Jeremy Armstrong, and graphic designers to assist in the creative process as well as fine-tuning all of the writing elements.  </p><p>Our timeline is to have two passages translated on average every month, giving ourselves 10 months for the writing and editing process.  We then have up to four months in the schedule for proofing, printing, and shipping so the books will be in your hands by February 2020, one year after the completion of this campaign!</p><h2>How it Will Read</h2><p>In order to understand our work process as a team, as well as give you a sample of what this translation will read like, we have completed one our chosen passages from the Old Testament and provided you with the text.  Below you will find Genesis 22:1-23:1, ""The Binding of Isaac"" from Timshel translation.  We suggest you read this story in your standard translation first for an accurate juxtaposition.  </p><p>""The Binding of Isaac"", Genesis 22:1-Genesis 23:1, Timshel</p><p><i>22 Years after Abraham had moved to Canaan and had the promise of his son fulfilled in Isaac, an ethereal voice called out to him in a dream. Abraham believed the summons came from Elohim, one of the pagan gods he worshiped, a god whose voice he heard when he left Ur. Yet, unbeknownst to Abraham, the pagan gods had remained silent, and it was Yahweh who spoke. Yahweh yearned to uncover Abraham’s ancestral convictions—to figure out what he still clung to and what he was willing to leave behind. He was measuring Abraham’s faith while Abraham was intent on discerning Elohim’s place in the divine hierarchy.</i></p><p><i>“Abraham, Father of Multitudes! Are you with me?” came the resounding voice. Although dreaming, Abraham responded, “Yes. All of me is here. I am not distracted or divided. I see you, and I hear you.” 2 Yahweh brought a request to Abraham, one to which He gave Abraham complete free will to accept or deny, “Please,  take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I will tell you.” 3 On waking from the dream, Abraham, father of, actually, only one—rose with the sun and saddled his donkey. He did not question Yahweh or dispute this request. Deliberately and precisely he cut the wood for the burnt offering, and with two servants and his son, he went to the place where Yahweh directed him. </i></p><p><i>4 The trip’s weight burdened Abraham, and despite—or perhaps because of—his free will in the matter, he moved slowly with his eyes down. His journey was equally both inward and onward. Neither Isaac nor Abraham spoke along the path; for three days they traveled in silence, each playing the impending events in their minds. While Abraham believed in child sacrifice and its ability to grant favor, the weight of its now-personal consequences clung to him while he hauled this internal conflict up the mountain. </i></p><p><i>At the same time, Isaac dutifully took a path he had traveled many times before: the gods called, and he went. Both of them understood sacrifice as an offering of the devout, a plea for respite in times of distress—a universal acknowledgment of the gods’ rite over the first fruits of a human’s labor. All reasons justified and deserving, yet with no clarity for the rationale of the impending ceremony. On the third day, Abraham arrived at the place Yahweh had directed him.</i></p><p><i>Capitulation to the gods had plagued him his entire life up until this point. Abraham always operated within an inherited belief system, yet the voice of Yahweh was different—Yahweh asked for connection instead of submission. Never born strictly out of obedience, true righteousness is begotten from mutual and worthy expectations. Abraham followed the voice of Yahweh out of Ur and into Canan; he left his tribe and family to do what this god said. But today, with his son on the altar the unique, intimate, voice of Yahweh left Abraham wrestling.</i></p><p><i>Since Abraham left Ur, Yahweh’s interaction with him functioned in the realm of kinship—a new set of beliefs marked by partnership between God and a human being. Abraham burned with great faith, but his faith was better defined as an active movement—a journey. Since encountering Yahweh, each sacred stage of life stretched and pulled his faith. Far from the old ways, this new faith was constantly redefined as he learned what fit and what didn’t, who Yahweh was and who he wasn’t. The old system sufficed until he himself held crying parents in his arms and carried dead children to their graves. Then the ways of his ancestors faltered in his heart, but they even still had a grip on him. Abraham desperately wanted to leave these ways behind but he needed divine permission to do so.  </i></p><p><i>The place where the sacrifice would occur came into view, and Abraham feared his old convictions would outrun his new pace. All rituals eventually become predictable and unvarying, and the steps ahead were clear: he would walk, worship, and build the altar, as was expected for a sacrifice. However this time, he would be giving his own test, as well. It was a trial to both himself and Yahweh, a type of quest for identity and character. Abraham was a man too focused on righteousness and faithfulness to disobey, but he desperately needed absolution on this particular sacrifice. His faith preservation required Yahweh to speak once again and confirm the relationship, as well as the justice, love, and mercy he had suspected. </i></p><p><i>He needed Yahweh to show up—to meet him on the mountain and stop the prevailing inequity he’d known for so long. Without Yahweh’s divine interception, he feared he would go through with the sacrifice—a choice that would unearth his darkest corners, never to be buried again. 5 Then Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey; I and the boy will go over there and worship and come again to you.” </i></p><p><i>6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son. And he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So they went both of them together, as one mind, like father, like son. 7 And Isaac said to his father, “Daddy!” In the midst of Abraham’s search for truth, Isaac searched for the man he knew Abraham to be: his dad. “I see you, and I hear you,” Abraham responded. Isaac revealed his own awareness when he asked the obvious question: “We have the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb?” </i></p><p><i>8 With sorrow, Abraham answered, “Yahweh will provide for himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” Walking side by side, their steps weighted by difference, experience, and perspective, Abraham was never more aware of how alike the two had become. As modeled by his father, Isaac loyally followed him up the mountain. So they went, both of them together—like father, like son.</i></p><p><i>9 When they came to the designated place, Abraham built an altar, laid the wood in the proper order, bound Isaac, and laid him on the altar on top of the wood. Isaac did not resist because Abraham had raised him to believe his own existence was disposable if the gods demanded it. Their religion depended on this ultimate possibility. Isaac did not argue. His silence was excruciating. Like father, like son. </i></p><p><i>10 Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to sacrifice his son. 11 A combination of betrayal, horror, and blind devotion to his father rose to the surface in Isaac. Suddenly, the angel of Yahweh called to him from heaven, “Abraham, Abraham! Father of Multitudes!” Breathless and covered in sweat, Abraham could barely get the words out, “Here I am.” At the same moment, Isaac gasped and released the breath he held as if full lungs would have blunted the knife. </i></p><p><i>12 At that moment the angel said, “Do not lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him.” The holy permission Abraham needed so desperately had come! The blessing to break ancient ways! Yahweh had seenhim and heardhim­­—heard his innermost thoughts, traced his conflicts and held them with care when they ebbed and flowed. He never left Abraham’s side. He journeyed with him, talking to Abraham in the sacrificial language he would know and understand. It was a stark contrast to the moral fiber of the pagan gods: Yahweh would never ask his worshipers for their firstborn son. 13 And Abraham lifted his eyes and saw a ram caught in a thicket by his horns. With a thud, the knife hit the ground and Abraham severed the cords that bound Isaac, who collapsed in his arms. Then Abraham seized the ram to replace his son. </i></p><p><i>14 So Abraham named the mountain, “Yahweh will provide.” And it is called, even to this day, “On the mount of Yahweh it shall be provided.” Yahweh had provided much more than a ram that day.

It is for you and for me and for all of us who are in process and need a new way to experience Jesus.  It is for all of us who have ever picked up the Bible and wanted more context and information because it can be hard to understand.  Timshel is for those of us who believe that Scripture is alive and beautiful and want to find new meaning inside of it.  It is a new way to read the Bible that sets the stage for creative interpretation, questions, wrestling and dialogue.The Bible is about what it means to be human and how God interacts with us along the journey.  When I preach and speak at churches, I dive deep into the text we are discussing and look at it from every angle: the historical and cultural background, word studies in the original language, commentaries on the passage at hand, the way the passage fits within the whole Biblical narrative, and the literary genre of the book.  Looking at all these different parts of the text allows us to understand the text and the characters through a deeper dimension, by understanding how their lives and circumstances affected them on a very personal level.  Each time I share the passages through this new lens, people always tell me it was ""something they never heard before"" or that it ""woke something up inside of them.""  I believe that the Bible has something to say to all of us, but not just how we are to live.  The Bible is a collection of poems, letters, and stories of different literary genres that have historical data, and meaning found in the original language. Timshel translation combines these intellectual disciplines with the historical and cultural vernacular. Timshel brings out the emotions, thoughts, struggles, triumphs, and psychological journeys that the Biblical characters are going through.  These efforts create a Bible translation in which readers can find a point of connection to their own inner journeys and personhood.The Product and the ProcessTimshel translation is a collection of 20 different Bible passages translated in a whole new way.  To mirror the beauty and depth of the Bible itself, we have decided to print this translation to be beautiful and aesthetically pleasing.  Designer and artist, Katie Noel, who designed our logo, will also be creating a limited edition book cover.  Her design will be foil stamped as seen in the mockup:The softcover editions will include the exclusively designed book cover, foil stamped and expertly put together.  The cover and pages are of finest quality and the dimension of the book reflect that of a novel so that it is easy to carry with you. The hardcover edition of the book will include the exclusively designed cover foil stamped on hand-woven linen fabric.  The cover and pages are of finest quality and the dimension of the book reflect that of a novel so that it is easy to carry with you. Each book is expertly sewn and handmade. Each of these editions will also include limited edition 20 pieces of artwork on colored, glossy paper, that reflect the new themes of each story found in Timshel.  If this project gets fully funded, I will be translating the following 20  passages* of the Bible:Old Testament Creation: Genesis 2-3 Tower of Babel: Genesis 11 Binding of Isaac: Genesis 22:1-23:2 The Exodus: Exodus 7:1-14:31 RuthPsalm 23 Proverbs 31The Land of Dry Bones: Ezekiel 37:1-5Death of MosesJonahNew Testament:  Parable of the Talents: Matthew 25:14-30 Word Became Flesh: John 1:1-18 Nicodemus: John 3:1-21  Jesus Anointed by a Sinful Woman: Luke 7:36-50 Mary and Martha: Luke 10:38-42  Jesus and the Syrophonecian WomanBeatitudesJesus Heals the Bleeding WomanPhilippians 2:5-7 Death and Resurrection of Jesus: Matthew 27-28, Mark 15-16, Luke 22-24, John 18-21*The exact verses of these passages are subject to change, and due to the literary genre of some passages, not all verses will be translated directly, or as in the case for the Birth of Jesus narrative, more than one book will be combined to form a more complete angle.  I will be doing the translating, but will be working with a Psychologist and Creative writer, Kyle Horst, as well as professional editor, Jeremy Armstrong, and graphic designers to assist in the creative process as well as fine-tuning all of the writing elements.  Our timeline is to have two passages translated on average every month, giving ourselves 10 months for the writing and editing process.  We then have up to four months in the schedule for proofing, printing, and shipping so the books will be in your hands by February 2020, one year after the completion of this campaign!How it Will ReadIn order to understand our work process as a team, as well as give you a sample of what this translation will read like, we have completed one our chosen passages from the Old Testament and provided you with the text.  Below you will find Genesis 22:1-23:1, ""The Binding of Isaac"" from Timshel translation.  We suggest you read this story in your standard translation first for an accurate juxtaposition.  ""The Binding of Isaac"", Genesis 22:1-Genesis 23:1, Timshel22 Years after Abraham had moved to Canaan and had the promise of his son fulfilled in Isaac, an ethereal voice called out to him in a dream. Abraham believed the summons came from Elohim, one of the pagan gods he worshiped, a god whose voice he heard when he left Ur. Yet, unbeknownst to Abraham, the pagan gods had remained silent, and it was Yahweh who spoke. Yahweh yearned to uncover Abraham’s ancestral convictions—to figure out what he still clung to and what he was willing to leave behind. He was measuring Abraham’s faith while Abraham was intent on discerning Elohim’s place in the divine hierarchy.“Abraham, Father of Multitudes! Are you with me?” came the resounding voice. Although dreaming, Abraham responded, “Yes. All of me is here. I am not distracted or divided. I see you, and I hear you.” 2 Yahweh brought a request to Abraham, one to which He gave Abraham complete free will to accept or deny, “Please,  take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I will tell you.” 3 On waking from the dream, Abraham, father of, actually, only one—rose with the sun and saddled his donkey. He did not question Yahweh or dispute this request. Deliberately and precisely he cut the wood for the burnt offering, and with two servants and his son, he went to the place where Yahweh directed him. 4 The trip’s weight burdened Abraham, and despite—or perhaps because of—his free will in the matter, he moved slowly with his eyes down. His journey was equally both inward and onward. Neither Isaac nor Abraham spoke along the path; for three days they traveled in silence, each playing the impending events in their minds. While Abraham believed in child sacrifice and its ability to grant favor, the weight of its now-personal consequences clung to him while he hauled this internal conflict up the mountain. At the same time, Isaac dutifully took a path he had traveled many times before: the gods called, and he went. Both of them understood sacrifice as an offering of the devout, a plea for respite in times of distress—a universal acknowledgment of the gods’ rite over the first fruits of a human’s labor. All reasons justified and deserving, yet with no clarity for the rationale of the impending ceremony. On the third day, Abraham arrived at the place Yahweh had directed him.Capitulation to the gods had plagued him his entire life up until this point. Abraham always operated within an inherited belief system, yet the voice of Yahweh was different—Yahweh asked for connection instead of submission. Never born strictly out of obedience, true righteousness is begotten from mutual and worthy expectations. Abraham followed the voice of Yahweh out of Ur and into Canan; he left his tribe and family to do what this god said. But today, with his son on the altar the unique, intimate, voice of Yahweh left Abraham wrestling.Since Abraham left Ur, Yahweh’s interaction with him functioned in the realm of kinship—a new set of beliefs marked by partnership between God and a human being. Abraham burned with great faith, but his faith was better defined as an active movement—a journey. Since encountering Yahweh, each sacred stage of life stretched and pulled his faith. Far from the old ways, this new faith was constantly redefined as he learned what fit and what didn’t, who Yahweh was and who he wasn’t. The old system sufficed until he himself held crying parents in his arms and carried dead children to their graves. Then the ways of his ancestors faltered in his heart, but they even still had a grip on him. Abraham desperately wanted to leave these ways behind but he needed divine permission to do so.  The place where the sacrifice would occur came into view, and Abraham feared his old convictions would outrun his new pace. All rituals eventually become predictable and unvarying, and the steps ahead were clear: he would walk, worship, and build the altar, as was expected for a sacrifice. However this time, he would be giving his own test, as well. It was a trial to both himself and Yahweh, a type of quest for identity and character. Abraham was a man too focused on righteousness and faithfulness to disobey, but he desperately needed absolution on this particular sacrifice. His faith preservation required Yahweh to speak once again and confirm the relationship, as well as the justice, love, and mercy he had suspected. He needed Yahweh to show up—to meet him on the mountain and stop the prevailing inequity he’d known for so long. Without Yahweh’s divine interception, he feared he would go through with the sacrifice—a choice that would unearth his darkest corners, never to be buried again. 5 Then Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey; I and the boy will go over there and worship and come again to you.” 6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son. And he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So they went both of them together, as one mind, like father, like son. 7 And Isaac said to his father, “Daddy!” In the midst of Abraham’s search for truth, Isaac searched for the man he knew Abraham to be: his dad. “I see you, and I hear you,” Abraham responded. Isaac revealed his own awareness when he asked the obvious question: “We have the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb?” 8 With sorrow, Abraham answered, “Yahweh will provide for himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” Walking side by side, their steps weighted by difference, experience, and perspective, Abraham was never more aware of how alike the two had become. As modeled by his father, Isaac loyally followed him up the mountain. So they went, both of them together—like father, like son.9 When they came to the designated place, Abraham built an altar, laid the wood in the proper order, bound Isaac, and laid him on the altar on top of the wood. Isaac did not resist because Abraham had raised him to believe his own existence was disposable if the gods demanded it. Their religion depended on this ultimate possibility. Isaac did not argue. His silence was excruciating. Like father, like son. 10 Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to sacrifice his son. 11 A combination of betrayal, horror, and blind devotion to his father rose to the surface in Isaac. Suddenly, the angel of Yahweh called to him from heaven, “Abraham, Abraham! Father of Multitudes!” Breathless and covered in sweat, Abraham could barely get the words out, “Here I am.” At the same moment, Isaac gasped and released the breath he held as if full lungs would have blunted the knife. 12 At that moment the angel said, “Do not lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him.” The holy permission Abraham needed so desperately had come! The blessing to break ancient ways! Yahweh had seenhim and heardhim­­—heard his innermost thoughts, traced his conflicts and held them with care when they ebbed and flowed. He never left Abraham’s side. He journeyed with him, talking to Abraham in the sacrificial language he would know and understand. It was a stark contrast to the moral fiber of the pagan gods: Yahweh would never ask his worshipers for their firstborn son. 13 And Abraham lifted his eyes and saw a ram caught in a thicket by his horns. With a thud, the knife hit the ground and Abraham severed the cords that bound Isaac, who collapsed in his arms. Then Abraham seized the ram to replace his son. 14 So Abraham named the mountain, “Yahweh will provide.” And it is called, even to this day, “On the mount of Yahweh it shall be provided.” Yahweh had provided much more than a ram that day. Abraham and Yahweh had encountered one another on the mountain, willing to put the other on trial for the sake of a new direction. Yahweh acted in a way Abraham yearned for and needed—a compassionate measure to put his former beliefs to death and raise new ones to life. Yahweh provided pardon where there once was death, forgiveness where there once was shame, and grace where there once was demand. Instantly the old ways of worship were made obsolete. The new day had arrived. 15 And the angel of Yahweh called to Abraham a second time from heaven 16 and said, “Your character has been made clear to me, and mine has been made clear to you. I do not resemble the gods of your past. While the other gods ask for your children, I have saved Isaac and will bless you with more. 17 I will surely multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and as the sand on the seashore. And your offspring shall possess the gate of his enemies, 18 and in your offspring shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because you have listened to my voice and heard my heart.” 19 Abraham and Isaac returned to the young men who accompanied them on their journey, and they all arose and went together to Beersheba.Father and son had much to discuss—to forgive. Pain, betrayal, hurt, and confusion plagued Issac, and the journey home gave appropriate space.  Unraveling beliefs marked the odyssey down the mountain, which from there would spread out to the infinite. Like father, like son, they began the process of grief, evolution, and eventually celebration. Finally, freedom belonged to them! And Abraham lived at Beersheba. 23 Upon Abraham and Isaac’s arrival, Sarah could not be found.

<h3>¿Qué?</h3>
<p>Polvo de estrellas nos sumerge en un mundo dominado por las emociones humanas...</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">¿Qué puede pasar si juegas con esas energías que ni conoces y por lo tanto eres incapaz de controlar? ¿Hacer que los demás paguen caro tu inconsciencia? Claro que ello te puede cambiar la percepción sobre lo ya conocido, pero también conducirte hasta los mismísimos infiernos. Varios protagonistas de esta historia, pertenecientes a distintas generaciones pasarán por ello. Se verán obligados a un cambio demasiado profundo, jamás experimentado. Pero hasta que el colectivo en general no tome conciencia de su misión, encontrando esa coherencia interna, las cosas no podrán cambiar. Serán incapaces de salir del estado en el que se han visto envueltos. Porque ahí es donde radica todo: en la simple pero enorme unidad del Universo.</p>
<h3>¿Quiénes?</h3>
<p><strong>Tandaia</strong> es una editorial con voluntad de cambio, de publicar obras poco convencionales pero de indudable calidad, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el emplear una campaña preventa para promocionar cada título cuando esta todavía se encuentra en proceso de edición.</p>

<h3>¿Por qué?</h3>
<p>Y por aquí una muestra de lo que encontraréis en sus páginas:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">«Con unos segundos de diferencia a esta angustiosa vivencia, surgió de repente otra. Algo estaba transformando esa aceleración obligándola a deslizarse de forma más pausada y suave. David, obligado por su mente a tomar conciencia de cualquier sensación experimentada fue <i>tocado </i>justo en lo más profundo de su ser. ¡Qué agradable bienestar le estaba proporcionando la corteza de ese chopo! ¡Y qué intensa! Se encontraba ante un gran almacén de energía. El joven se dio la vuelta y abrazó con fuerza el tronco. Aparte de no caerse así podría disfrutar mejor del momento. La consistencia de la realidad había comenzado a ponerse un poco rara. Llovían… ¡colores! Verdes, violetas y azules. Danzando en plena armonía. Y ese árbol se estaba transformando en algo blando y gelatinoso. Y muy sedoso. Tanto que su suavidad se filtraba por todo su ser. Era un objeto tremendamente confortable. ¡Como para separarse de él! Esta otra realidad era muy distinta a la que conocía, pero no le importaba. ¿Qué más daba que los colores no existieran como tal o los sonidos tampoco? ¿Qué mal había en ver más allá de las tres conocidas dimensiones? Se encontraba muy bien. Era lo importante. <br/>                El sentido del olfato era ahora el sentido al que mayor atención le estaba prestando el joven. En el entorno, los diferentes aromas que lo rodeaban estaban llegando al foco de su conciencia a raudales. Uno en concreto, por penetrante e inusual, había impregnado el lugar con un olor especial. A David le recordó al color verde oscuro si es que éste se pudiera oler. Allí se respiraba naturaleza, vida. Aquella fragancia le envolvió por completo y, aparte de equilibrarlo, le había dado… ¡la bienvenida!<br/>                Todo lo que le rodeaba empezó a vibrar ante él. David no tuvo necesidad de tocar nada para poder sentir aquello de forma muy intensa. Y aunque estaba oscuro, el chico no tenía ningún problema en estar viendo circular la savia por las venas de los árboles y las pulsaciones de los colores navegando por el aire. O los sonidos que se escuchaban volverse a convertir en brillantes colores como si fueran flujos nebulosos en movimiento. Todo se combinaba y mezclaba comprendiéndose mutuamente. El joven se hallaba en un inmenso jardín sin flores, pero bañado con mil fragancias diferentes. Y no es que lo estuviera “viendo” sino que ese jardín estaba floreciendo en él. Y eran muchas plantas y a la vez una sola como si todo fuera el mismo ser, pero a la vez se conservara la individualidad de cada forma. Todo olor, sonido o color David podía saborearlo con una exquisita e inconfundible facilidad. Los estaba contemplando en toda su plenitud. Y por primera vez ya no había mundo sino universo: un único latir, un solo corazón. La totalidad era mayor que cada una de sus partes. ¡Increíble! El joven se sintió especial, único. Ser capaz de apreciar todo aquello era una sensación irrepetible. Muy, muy particular. Algo mágico. ¡Maravilloso! Le causaba gran placer».</p>

</div></div>","¿Qué?
Polvo de estrellas nos sumerge en un mundo dominado por las emociones humanas...
¿Qué puede pasar si juegas con esas energías que ni conoces y por lo tanto eres incapaz de controlar? ¿Hacer que los demás paguen caro tu inconsciencia? Claro que ello te puede cambiar la percepción sobre lo ya conocido, pero también conducirte hasta los mismísimos infiernos. Varios protagonistas de esta historia, pertenecientes a distintas generaciones pasarán por ello. Se verán obligados a un cambio demasiado profundo, jamás experimentado. Pero hasta que el colectivo en general no tome conciencia de su misión, encontrando esa coherencia interna, las cosas no podrán cambiar. Serán incapaces de salir del estado en el que se han visto envueltos. Porque ahí es donde radica todo: en la simple pero enorme unidad del Universo.
¿Quiénes?
Tandaia es una editorial con voluntad de cambio, de publicar obras poco convencionales pero de indudable calidad, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el emplear una campaña preventa para promocionar cada título cuando esta todavía se encuentra en proceso de edición.
De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.
Hoy te presentamos a Reme Cuéllar.
Natural de Medina del Campo (Valladolid), es autora de numerosas novelas, relatos y una obra de teatro. También ha escrito el guion de un cortometraje (El translúcido), poesía en español, francés e inglés («The Christmas Word» poema ganador en un concurso) y algún ensayo. En 1988 su relato «¡Silencio! Se duerme» obtuvo el reconocimiento del jurado en el Primer Certamen de Relatos Breves de Mujer (Ayto de Valladolid) y está publicado en un libro con dicho nombre. Es coautora (tanto en textos como en fotografías) de la realización del libro: Moraleja de las Panaderas (Diputación de Valladolid). Seleccionada en el I Concurso Internacional de Haikus y en otros cinco concursos, tiene publicados sus microrrelatos y su haiku en sus correspondientes libros. Durante un año fue parte integrante del equipo de redacción de la revista Ceteribus Paribus de la Facultad de Ciencias Económicas de Valladolid y un cuento suyo, «Nita y su libro mágico», fue visionado en la Semana de los derechos de la infancia en Medina del Campo. Desde hace unos años imparte, de manera puntual o continua, diversos talleres literario creativos.
Con Polvo de estrellas la autora, basándose en algunas experiencias y hechos reales, nos muestra de manera novelada que a veces la realidad no es ni como creemos que es o nos la contaron. 
¿Por qué?
Y por aquí una muestra de lo que encontraréis en sus páginas:
«Con unos segundos de diferencia a esta angustiosa vivencia, surgió de repente otra. Algo estaba transformando esa aceleración obligándola a deslizarse de forma más pausada y suave. David, obligado por su mente a tomar conciencia de cualquier sensación experimentada fue tocado justo en lo más profundo de su ser. ¡Qué agradable bienestar le estaba proporcionando la corteza de ese chopo! ¡Y qué intensa! Se encontraba ante un gran almacén de energía. El joven se dio la vuelta y abrazó con fuerza el tronco. Aparte de no caerse así podría disfrutar mejor del momento. La consistencia de la realidad había comenzado a ponerse un poco rara. Llovían… ¡colores! Verdes, violetas y azules. Danzando en plena armonía. Y ese árbol se estaba transformando en algo blando y gelatinoso. Y muy sedoso. Tanto que su suavidad se filtraba por todo su ser. Era un objeto tremendamente confortable. ¡Como para separarse de él! Esta otra realidad era muy distinta a la que conocía, pero no le importaba. ¿Qué más daba que los colores no existieran como tal o los sonidos tampoco? ¿Qué mal había en ver más allá de las tres conocidas dimensiones? Se encontraba muy bien. Era lo importante.                 El sentido del olfato era ahora el sentido al que mayor atención le estaba prestando el joven. En el entorno, los diferentes aromas que lo rodeaban estaban llegando al foco de su conciencia a raudales. Uno en concreto, por penetrante e inusual, había impregnado el lugar con un olor especial. A David le recordó al color verde oscuro si es que éste se pudiera oler. Allí se respiraba naturaleza, vida. Aquella fragancia le envolvió por completo y, aparte de equilibrarlo, le había dado… ¡la bienvenida!                Todo lo que le rodeaba empezó a vibrar ante él. David no tuvo necesidad de tocar nada para poder sentir aquello de forma muy intensa. Y aunque estaba oscuro, el chico no tenía ningún problema en estar viendo circular la savia por las venas de los árboles y las pulsaciones de los colores navegando por el aire. O los sonidos que se escuchaban volverse a convertir en brillantes colores como si fueran flujos nebulosos en movimiento. Todo se combinaba y mezclaba comprendiéndose mutuamente. El joven se hallaba en un inmenso jardín sin flores, pero bañado con mil fragancias diferentes. Y no es que lo estuviera “viendo” sino que ese jardín estaba floreciendo en él. Y eran muchas plantas y a la vez una sola como si todo fuera el mismo ser, pero a la vez se conservara la individualidad de cada forma. Todo olor, sonido o color David podía saborearlo con una exquisita e inconfundible facilidad. Los estaba contemplando en toda su plenitud. Y por primera vez ya no había mundo sino universo: un único latir, un solo corazón. La totalidad era mayor que cada una de sus partes. ¡Increíble! El joven se sintió especial, único. Ser capaz de apreciar todo aquello era una sensación irrepetible. Muy, muy particular. Algo mágico. ¡Maravilloso! Le causaba gran placer».
¿Cómo?
Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 880€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cincuenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.

Teniendo acceso a las galeradas de edición.
Recibiendo un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.
Si bien, también podrías ver tu nombre en los agradecimientos aportando un poco más.

The paper quality and the reach of the marketing campaign will be the things that are compromised. </span></li>

Hey Everyone! 


I know it looks like the book already exists but the company who designed the cover sent me this mock-up photo, as part of their package for their cover design : )  

So far so good with the cover, the professionally edited story and the blurb but there's still a little way to go. Still on the to-do list are: the back cover, the spine and the interior design and formatting. As well as the printing and the all-important marketing. 

Please will you help me complete this project? 

In case you're wondering, here is the blurb for the book: 



Australia is ruled by the SIF.



The Special Investigation Force controls everything. Water,
food, fuel … women’s bodies. 
18-year-old Ora has never questioned their authority;
everyone knows it’s all for the ‘safety of the nation’. 
But Ora’s decision to move in with her aunt is a bad one. She’s
just landed herself in the middle of nowhere with a deluded activist who wants
to change the world, one illegal birth at a time. Sooner or later someone is
going to die and Ora doesn’t know where to turn.
The beach is her only sanctuary and it’s here that she meets
Jake, thoughtful and experienced, who encourages her to live a little. So why
is it that as soon as she starts to have some fun, everything goes dangerously wrong?
A gripping coming-of-age adventure that will leave you on
the edge of your seat.   
The story, as well as being a real page-turner, raises questions about body sovereignty and women's rights. These are issues that need to be talked about, thought about and acted upon. ORA'S GOLD grew out of a rich and potent compost: Australia's current birthing culture; the three births of my own children; hours spent sourcing and editing countless birth stories for magazines and my training and experience as a doula/birth attendant.
Ora herself entered stage left at the end of a phenomenal flu back in November, 2011. After the fever had broken, I sat up, grabbed my laptop and wrote the key scene where Ora is a very reluctant player in a highly charged and dangerous situation. The rest of the book sprang up around this scene, sometimes randomly, sometimes organically. I didn't have the plot mapped out from the beginning and I wasn't always happy about what happened. In fact, I was rather distraught somewhere near the middle of the book. At the time though, I didn't know it was the middle of the book and I didn't know the ending either. As you may imagine, the structuring was a nightmare but with the help of time (years!) a talented editor and many re-writes, I finally ironed out all of the issues. 

My dream is to produce a beautifully designed book and push it out into the world as far and wide as a canny marketing strategy will take me.  A successful marketing campaign will mean the difference between a few hundred readers and many thousands. But first, I need a well-designed product.  Here are a few more details:
 
$3000 will pay for: 



The completion of the design - the back cover, the spine and the interior layout and formatting ($1200)

Printing and good paper quality ($800)
Marketing ($1000. If anything more than this is raised, it will go towards a bigger and better marketing campaign) 
Commission to Indiegogo and Paypal ($240)
 The Perks - the book!! Either digital or paperback or both. If I don't reach the entire goal, I will still design and print the book and the marketing will depend completely on me which I will give my best shot. Either way, I'll still be doing most of the marketing.      The Impact 
With your help, this book will be read by thousands of people, particularly younger folk. As well as it being an entertaining read, it will expose them to births other than the standard ones you see depicted in modern day culture where the woman is usually on her back and powerless. I also hope it will encourage discussion about women's informed choice.    Risks & Challenges 

This is a low-risk project. I'm almost through the gates. Today, I sent the manuscript off to the graphic designer for the design and layout/formatting. Once that's done the back cover and spine will be designed. So if you donate, you will definitely receive a book, even if I don't reach the entire goal. The paper quality and the reach of the marketing campaign will be the things that are compromised. 
This will be my third foray into self-publishing. My non-fiction book for breastfeeding mothers is still selling well and has proven to be very useful to many. Barefoot magazine ran for three years and was read and enjoyed by thousands. I have industry experience, so I will use the funds well : )

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>My name is Devyn Bakewell and I am the author of ""Greater Love"". I decided to write this book because young black voices need to be heard more often and need to be better represented in literature. We should be able to find books that speak of our life experiences, what we go through, and how we carry on throughout life. My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the struggles of self-discovery, finding love, and navigating as a black young adult in America. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with HBCU/college life, young adult love, black love, as well as start a discussion of navigating a racist America as a young black person, especially in today’s society. </p>
<p><strong>Ryan McKnight left for New York with a plan to leave her hometown, family, and friends completely behind her. With the excitement of going to college and moving across the country for the first time, the goal is to dive head first into her school, work, and her dreams and excel. She wants new friends to become family, new opportunities, and just a new life in general. However, she quickly finds out that isn’t as easy to leave the past behind as she thinks even when traveling over a thousand miles to escape it. When Ryan reconnects with Devyn Baker, a popular jock from her old high school, she wants nothing to do with him and makes it obvious. But fate has a way of continuously putting him in her path. Will she be able to get rid of him and continue on with her new life? Or will her past keep getting in the way?</strong></p>
<p><u><strong>Message for All: </strong></u></p>
<p>You will love this book if you’re a young woman, a black woman, or just a person trying to get a first-hand view of what college is. You will enjoy this book if you’re looking for a good escape and a beautiful romance, and you will enjoy this book if you want to read a story about a girl who is imperfect and finding her way. <br/><br/>""Greater Love"" speaks to adults and young adults who want to grapple with college life and black love in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that ""Greater Love"" inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>

My name is Devyn Bakewell and I am the author of ""Greater Love"". I decided to write this book because young black voices need to be heard more often and need to be better represented in literature. We should be able to find books that speak of our life experiences, what we go through, and how we carry on throughout life. My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the struggles of self-discovery, finding love, and navigating as a black young adult in America. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with HBCU/college life, young adult love, black love, as well as start a discussion of navigating a racist America as a young black person, especially in today’s society. 
Ryan McKnight left for New York with a plan to leave her hometown, family, and friends completely behind her. With the excitement of going to college and moving across the country for the first time, the goal is to dive head first into her school, work, and her dreams and excel. She wants new friends to become family, new opportunities, and just a new life in general. However, she quickly finds out that isn’t as easy to leave the past behind as she thinks even when traveling over a thousand miles to escape it. When Ryan reconnects with Devyn Baker, a popular jock from her old high school, she wants nothing to do with him and makes it obvious. But fate has a way of continuously putting him in her path. Will she be able to get rid of him and continue on with her new life? Or will her past keep getting in the way?
Message for All: 
You will love this book if you’re a young woman, a black woman, or just a person trying to get a first-hand view of what college is. You will enjoy this book if you’re looking for a good escape and a beautiful romance, and you will enjoy this book if you want to read a story about a girl who is imperfect and finding her way. ""Greater Love"" speaks to adults and young adults who want to grapple with college life and black love in a new way.Ultimately, I hope that ""Greater Love"" inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:

How can one’s view of us benefit the way we see ourselves? What can one do to start new journeys in becoming their best self? How does love benefit ones life and what purpose does it bring to one’s life? 
How can communities make sure all of their members are seen, heard, and taken care of? Why do black communities hide it’s faults and let negative/cruel parties continue to damage the lives of it’s members overtime (situations in regard to sexual assault of minors, drug use, etc.)? What are the primary issues in society (black or otherwise) that are often swept under the rug but need to be dealt with? Why does a complicated relationship between police and black people still stand today? Can this relationship be improved, and if not why? 
Why is college such an important time of self-discovery? Do stereotypes stand in college, and are they necessary in this liberal millennial age? Is young love real? Why is sexual assault so prominent in college and on college campuses? is there one way to heal from sexual assault? 

 
I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing race, your adult life, college life, young love, and sexual assault will change us all for the better.

<p>Biathlon! No, I don’t swim and run… and there is no biking involved. And
I don’t use a bow to shoot my targets either. I cross-country ski and I shoot
a rifle. It’s the best combination between the skier’s physical abilities and the

</p>
<p><b>Yeah Yeah! So what? </b></p>
<p>Well traveling to Europe is pretty expensive! I have to pay all the tour
fees by myself. So, I need to pay for flights, transport, hotel, food, coaches’
fees, registration, clothing and more. The total will be around $4000. That is in addition to the training fees like housing and living in Canmore, club and team fees both in Canmore and Québec, training camps, training and racing equipment and much more that bring my expenses up to over $20 000.<br/></p>

<h3>Unapologetically Insane Tales - The stories' story.</h3>
<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>Thanks for dropping by. I'm Zed, librarian and storycrafter. 6 years back, I was on a jetplane to Amsterdam. I had a pen and a notebook, and I wrote the beginning of a story. It was about a boy with a peculiar condition. He had tendrils growing out from his eyes and could see things that no one else could: Flying cows, talking snails and glowing mushrooms. He was a strange kid indeed.</p>
<p>So was I. At 14, I decided that I liked philosophy, and a decade later, while many of my peers have gotten business and econs degrees, I graduated with a degree in philosophy. The philosophical mind is a fertile ground for imagination, and I did have this crazy head of ideas and narratives. I felt I had to put these stories down somewhere, because stories are creatures that die if you do not put them in prose. It's like fish and water. You put a fish in water or it dies. You put a story on paper or it dies.</p>
<p>Like that, I went on a mission to save stories and I wrote and wrote. So six years on, twenty of them are gathered here, in a 120 page book, finally ready to breathe. I hope you give them a chance. I feel like the father of these orphan stories. ('Contradiction, aha!' you say. I know, but it make sense in a nonsensical way!) They might not look like the clean cut boys born of polished pens, but they are good children. If you give them a chance, they would dance for you.</p>

If you know my name, it's because you're already familiar with me, my photography or my writing. If you don't know my name, it's because I am a very humble person who always feels like nothing is ever good enough. It's time to change that. Photography is where I fell in love with the visual part of life, and writing is where I get to fill in all of the blank spaces that I see. It took a great amount of courage to even post any of my writing online, let alone take on a project like this. You can find a decent sampling of my writing on instagram (@bill_speakman). To publish a small chapbook of my poetry (roughly 35-50 pages) is something I have wanted to do for a while. I also want to show different sides of me and my writing that aren't always instagram friendly (aka too lengthy, too in depth etc. not offensive or anything.). This is my chance. I want this to be a positive experience for me and anyone who reads this.</p>
<p>However, this is also a way for me to give back to the people who have supported me, and also a chance to give to charity. I will donate 5% of any money raised to TWLOHA (To Write Love On Her Arms). If I reach the goal I set, I will double it to 10%, since I will have to pay less to fund this. (unfortunately the lowest goal you can set is 500, which is double what I wanted to set it at. So, it will take some work to hit this goal. I promise I will make it worth it if it happens though.)</p>

<h4><i>365 Days of Mischief and Adventure on Mount Washington</i></h4>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Mount Washington, home of the world’s worst weather, is more than just a “Rock Pile”—it’s the cultural and natural soul of climbers and tourists from around the world. Travel writer and journalist Dan Szczesny will spend a year participating in Mount Washington's many happenings, including:</span></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>The</b> <b>Mt. Washington Observatory:</b> Dan will spend a week on the summit—""Home of the World's Worst Weather""—cooking for the Mt. Washington Observatory crew. Since he does not cook, we're uncertain who will survive.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Seek the Peak:</b> This annual fundraiser brings hikers from around the world together to converge at the summit from every direction on the mountain. We'll meet as many of them as possible.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Adaptive Sports Sunrise Ascent:</b> Dan will be a ""mule"" on an adaptive sports team whose goal will be to reach the summit with an adaptive athlete who needs assistance.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Alton Weagle Day:</b> Dan will try to make it into the record books by being the first person to climb the mountain dressed like Walt Whitman and reading poetry all the way up!<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Dan's first ascent with a toddler:</b> Perhaps the most grueling summit attempt of them all, Dan will backpack with his toddler daughter to the top.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Other events and chapters will include:</b> The Bike Hill Climb, the Road Race, Minis on Top, ATV Climb and Bicknell's Thrush Tour. Dan will also look at the mountain's history and the strange convergence of organizations (Cog Railroad, Auto Road, State Park, National Forest and AMC) that come together to create an odd and exciting partnership.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Dan will capture all of these characters, experiences, observations, histories, and discoveries in <i>The White Mountain</i>!</span></p>

<h1>What Will This Money Be Used For?</h1>
</div>
</div><div>
<h4>Participation &amp; Research</h4>
<p>Your generous contributions are essential to helping us present Mount Washington as it truly is—not just a mountain to be climbed, but a cultural center of the United States. As many writers know, it's not cheap to drop everything and spend a year doing research for a non-fiction book. On top of that, Dan's research will include participating in multiple events throughout 2017—all of which take place hours north of his hometown (Manchester, NH). Most of the funds we raise from this campaign will support Dan's efforts and will allow him the time and money needed to put forth this important book.</p>
<h4>Printing</h4> <p>As a traditional publisher, we cover all pre-press and printing expenses and pay royalties to our authors on all of our books. <i>The White Mountain</i>, however, is a very grand endeavor—Dan will be spending a year participating in events on Mount Washington, and we'd like to document his experiences with full-color photos throughout the book. We aren't asking you to cover all of our printing expenses—that's our responsibility!—but a small portion of the funds we raise from this campaign will go towards the added expense of printing with full color and bleeds throughout, which we believe a book of this cultural significance deserves.</p>

The White Mountain
365 Days of Mischief and Adventure on Mount Washington
Mount Washington, home of the world’s worst weather, is more than just a “Rock Pile”—it’s the cultural and natural soul of climbers and tourists from around the world. Travel writer and journalist Dan Szczesny will spend a year participating in Mount Washington's many happenings, including:



The Mt. Washington Observatory: Dan will spend a week on the summit—""Home of the World's Worst Weather""—cooking for the Mt. Washington Observatory crew. Since he does not cook, we're uncertain who will survive.


Seek the Peak: This annual fundraiser brings hikers from around the world together to converge at the summit from every direction on the mountain. We'll meet as many of them as possible.


Adaptive Sports Sunrise Ascent: Dan will be a ""mule"" on an adaptive sports team whose goal will be to reach the summit with an adaptive athlete who needs assistance.


Alton Weagle Day: Dan will try to make it into the record books by being the first person to climb the mountain dressed like Walt Whitman and reading poetry all the way up!


Dan's first ascent with a toddler: Perhaps the most grueling summit attempt of them all, Dan will backpack with his toddler daughter to the top.


Other events and chapters will include: The Bike Hill Climb, the Road Race, Minis on Top, ATV Climb and Bicknell's Thrush Tour. Dan will also look at the mountain's history and the strange convergence of organizations (Cog Railroad, Auto Road, State Park, National Forest and AMC) that come together to create an odd and exciting partnership.
Dan will capture all of these characters, experiences, observations, histories, and discoveries in The White Mountain!


Who Are We?





Founded in 1991, we have published more than fifty titles, almost all of which have strong connections to New England. We are a traditional, independent publisher that specializes in producing beautiful, well designed books—the care we take during each stage of pre-press is meticulous. We use fantastic printers located in the United States and work closely with all of our authors long after their books have been published. On top of its very dear-to-heart subject, The White Mountain is perfect for us because we know it will be written entertainingly and expertly by two-time Hobblebush author, Dan Szczesny.

What Will This Money Be Used For?


Participation & Research
Your generous contributions are essential to helping us present Mount Washington as it truly is—not just a mountain to be climbed, but a cultural center of the United States. As many writers know, it's not cheap to drop everything and spend a year doing research for a non-fiction book. On top of that, Dan's research will include participating in multiple events throughout 2017—all of which take place hours north of his hometown (Manchester, NH). Most of the funds we raise from this campaign will support Dan's efforts and will allow him the time and money needed to put forth this important book.
Printing As a traditional publisher, we cover all pre-press and printing expenses and pay royalties to our authors on all of our books. The White Mountain, however, is a very grand endeavor—Dan will be spending a year participating in events on Mount Washington, and we'd like to document his experiences with full-color photos throughout the book. We aren't asking you to cover all of our printing expenses—that's our responsibility!—but a small portion of the funds we raise from this campaign will go towards the added expense of printing with full color and bleeds throughout, which we believe a book of this cultural significance deserves.


    Other Ways You Can Help Anything you can do to spread the word is helpful beyond belief. Here are a few ideas to get you started:

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<i>Mastermind: How Successful People Manage Their Mental Health</i><br/><br/>My name is Ali Friedman, and I am the author of Mastermind. After recently struggling with anxiety, I've been increasingly exposed to the prevalence of mental illness, a lack of understanding of said illnesses, and a lack of adequate resources to address the issues. As a result of my personal challenges and realizing that I was not alone, I felt it was time to take matters into my own hands, by openly exploring why the stigma exists and what can be done to overcome it.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that while mental health can seem like a daunting topic, there are tangible measures you can take to promote your well-being. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for mental health in you. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help implement strategies to relieve some of your stress and strengthen your overall wellness.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about both formal and informal strategies to help maximize your success:<ul>
<li>The Best and the Brightest - How those at the top of their field overcome their struggles and manage their stress</li>
<li>Normalization - How taking advantage of formal resources and mental health mechanisms such as therapy can benefit everyone, not just those who have a diagnosed illness</li>
<li>No Discrimination - How Olympians, to college students, to budding entrepreneurs alike can harness the same skills and utilize similar tools to promote their well-being</li>
</ul>
<p>My goal is that this book has value for everyone who picks it up, rather than just those with mental illnesses or some niche group. Everyone deals with stress, so my hope is that this book will give people from all walks of life insight into how you can better manage, or at least be more aware of, your mental health.<br/><br/>Mastermind is a non-fiction book that speaks to college students and adults of all ages who want to look at mental wellness and managing stress in a new light.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Book - Mastermind</h2>
<p>The book is written in 3 Parts....<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the Introduction + Chapters 1-3. You will learn about the stigma surrounding mental health, why no one wants to talk about it, and how that negatively affects our own perceptions. I will also highlight how mental issues are as real and painful as physical ones, and address the current lack of adequate resources.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains Chapters 4-5. In this section, I will suggest that there is evidence that society is moving in the right direction, but that we still have a ways to go, in regard to addressing the importance of mental health. Then, I will present the stories of an Olympic runner, a hostage negotiator, and a young Juilliard dancer to convey the benefits of formal resources offered in established company settings.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains Chapters 6-8, which focus on the more informal ways to promote your success, in whatever path you choose. I will compare the stories of those in large versus smaller businesses, and share how others have found tremendous value in the power of humor, as just one example.<br/> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2> This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<br/> <ul>
<li>The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in July, 2019</li>
<li>The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!</li>
<li>The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)</li>
<li>The Copyediting for My Book - to help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication</li>
<li>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this summer</li>
</ul> When I pre-sell 100 copies of my book, I will also publish an audiobook. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition.<br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:<ul>
<li>You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish</li>
<li>A Personal, handwritten thank you note for pre-ordering my book</li>
<li>Your Name will appear in a Special, Acknowledgements Section of my book (“with Special Thanks to”)</li>
<li>Early access to the Introduction of my Book and my entire manuscript, with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedback</li>
<li>The opportunity to help give me feedback and be involved in selecting my cover</li>
<li>I will do a book topic/workshop seminar where I will share the experiences of writing my book</li>
<li>And more...</li>
</ul>

The concepts are meant to inspire the reader to realize their own ability to change themselves as well as better adapt to external circumstances that aren’t as controllable.<br/><br/>My name is Alli Esker and I am the author of The Power of Pivot. I wrote this book because I’ve always been fascinated by the idea of change and wanted to explore the intersection of that concept with my passion for women’s empowerment and equality.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will realize or rediscover your own ability to adapt, change, and pivot on your journey through life. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for transformation and a growth mindset into your life. Ultimately, I want you to find this book to be a tool to help you find tactical means and real life examples to the changes you wish to see within yourself, your community, and the world.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the principles of changes that lead to success :</p><ul>
<li>A closer look at the human condition - We’ll explore what I call ‘The Female Condition’, and dig into a historical account of women from the neolithic era to present day.

You’ll see that regardless of the environment, women are specifically able to realize change.</li>
<li>Grit and Tenacity - 15 year old Gitanjali Rao is on a mission to solve Flint, Michigan’s water crisis, among a plethora of other passion projects to help enhance the world. You’ll learn from her story that even through criticism and lack of respect due to her age, her never-give-up attitude is what propels her to succeed.</li>
<li>The value of curiosity - Asking questions leads to the ability to see things from a different perspective. We’ll dive into the topic of curiosity from both a present-day and historical lens and how it’s impacted the world through the fascinating story of the greatest mariners to every sail the world, the Polynesian Wayfinders, as well as through one of the world’s greatest inventors, Leonardo DaVinci.</li>

<li>Part 1 contains the introduction + chapter 1. I break down the concept of change in an easy to comprehend framework where we’ll deep dive into the question, ‘What creates change?’, and I’ll deconstruct some preconceived notions on the subject. From their you’ll learn about the idea of “The Female Condition” (As mentioned above) from a historical perspective, and learn about the special biological and psychological abilities that women can lean into to succeed.</li>
<li>Part 2 contains Chapters 2-9. In this section we dig deeper into some principles of change that catalyze success. You’ll learn from both males and females from the historical side and stories from inspiring women today who are practicing these principles, whether that be from being innovative, believing in oneself, or being vulnerable.</li>
<li>Part 3 contains Chapters 10. It contains the culmination of everywhere we’ve journeyed throughout the book. I tie everything together with an overarching reminder that you yourself are the sole captain of actualizing change and provide some final universal reasons to compel you to do so.</li>

I break down the concept of change in an easy to comprehend framework where we’ll deep dive into the question, ‘What creates change?’, and I’ll deconstruct some preconceived notions on the subject. From their you’ll learn about the idea of “The Female Condition” (As mentioned above) from a historical perspective, and learn about the special biological and psychological abilities that women can lean into to succeed.
Part 2 contains Chapters 2-9. In this section we dig deeper into some principles of change that catalyze success. You’ll learn from both males and females from the historical side and stories from inspiring women today who are practicing these principles, whether that be from being innovative, believing in oneself, or being vulnerable.
Part 3 contains Chapters 10. It contains the culmination of everywhere we’ve journeyed throughout the book. I tie everything together with an overarching reminder that you yourself are the sole captain of actualizing change and provide some final universal reasons to compel you to do so.

<h2>Story of My Book - Take Your Turn, Teddy</h2>Nothing has been normal for Teddy, not since discovering the harsh reality of the monster he had been living with his whole life. He and his mother left that behind to start over in a small Indiana township, but as Teddy begins to learn of humanity's monsters, he'll unveil an otherworldly evil which he calls ""The Shadow."" The Shadow tests Teddy's vulnerability and a growing sense of isolation, poisoning his mind, and conjuring a vile killer-in-the-making.<br/><br/>My name is Haley Newlin and I am the author of Take Your Turn, Teddy. I wrote this book because most people associate horror novels with the written counterpart to slasher films and miss the opportunity to expose themselves to the self-reflection horror demands. Everything we fear is personal. Horror makes us look those fears in the face and say, “Why do you scare me? Where does your power over me stem from? And how do I beat you?”<br/> <h2>The Impact</h2> My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover a hungry shadow that mirrors the darkness in our minds. I want you to see that each mental trial is an exercise in control—either giving it up or fighting to reclaim it. I want this book to be an opportunity to understand that the shadow lives in all of us and it wants us to believe that our control is long lost. But it’s not. The ultimate control comes from us, a lesson Teddy will have to learn in hopes of regaining his true inner self.<br/><br/>In this book, you will meet the protagonist and the eventual anti-hero, Teddy, and the antagonist, The Shadow figure. The world is set in a rural Indiana township, followed by a series of rural towns, in the early 1970s. The story's time and place build on a sense of isolation for Teddy as he is backed further into the control of The Shadow.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you enjoy purposeful horror, using fear as an ultimate control center. Also, if you are a fan of psychological horror stories like Shirley Jackson’s The Haunting of Hill House and Stephen King’s The Shining.<br/><br/>Take Your Turn, Teddy speaks to horror and gothic-fiction fans who want to grapple with darkness and fear to fight the inner demons we often try to bury away into the depths of our minds.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that Take Your Turn, Teddy inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:<p>Why do I carry the fear that I do?</p>
<p>How does this fear shape the person I am and how I interact with others?</p>
<p>How do I do more to prompt mental check-ins and face trauma and change the way I view mental health issues?</p>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers — coming together and discussing how real-world issues and trauma, in connection to the feeling of loss of control, will change us all for the better.</p>

I had a son at 16 and soon after at 17 I had a daughter. I Fought hard to make sure they were not hurt by him or anyone. He was deported back to Costa Rica and I followed thinking he would change because he told me would. my kids and I were held hostage in Costa Rica for a year because he would not let us leave. He was so abusive and even more so because we were not in the USA. In that year my 6 month old daughter at that time almost died. I fought hard to get back.

The story you are about to read is true- it is about my life. I would like you to take a moment to read about my sorrows and how I found inspiration to persevere I have become a voice for those that are the silent ones…….. the abused children and woman. I am opening a foundation that will provide a home for woman that have been abused  to have a place to go to get on there feet and become independent successful woman. 
 
Have a blessed day for here is my story……………                                                                                  
 
My Name is Jessica Solsona and I was a victim of abuse.
I was molested as a child by my step father ….. for years……while my own mother knew me being violated and did nothing to stop it. ……for years I did not know why she did not protect me.  she told me she hated me because she thought …… she thought he was paying more attention to me then her. He would go to my bedroom every night and take me to the sofa while he watched porn. I was so scared ………   He would tell me not to fight back or I would get beaten. I just laid there numb, wanting someone to save me. I turned to my mother for comfort and protection, there was none. She said she hated me because in her mind I was stealing the man she loved. There was no solitude, no place for me to turn .  
I never had the protection a child should have….. the protection a child needs from her parents. The very people who should have kept me safe had imprisoned me into a life sexual slavery.
When I was 15 I was married just to get out of the abuse to only get myself into another abusive 7 years! He abused me everyday. I left school to work and pay his court fees. I had a son at 16 and soon after at 17 I had a daughter. I Fought hard to make sure they were not hurt by him or anyone. He was deported back to Costa Rica and I followed thinking he would change because he told me would. my kids and I were held hostage in Costa Rica for a year because he would not let us leave. He was so abusive and even more so because we were not in the USA. In that year my 6 month old daughter at that time almost died. I fought hard to get back. I made it back to the USA with both my kids and without him! I worked so hard to get on my feet. I now I remarried and now have four children. I want to show them there mothers a solder And can overcome anything! 
 
My story is my life and through it all I had my faith in God…………….. I knew that I was brought onto this earth for a greater meaning. A meaning that eluded me. My search for peace is all that kept me going through the many uears of abuse that followed. My faith that one day I would make my way through the depair and use every ounce of my being to make sure other children and women did not endure what I had.
My dream of one day having a family of my own has come true. However the physical as well as emotional scars have remained.Like many women and children that go through what I have Ihave Complex Post Traumatic Stress D…….. or PTSD. Though my will is strong, at this time I am unable to mauntain full timeemployment. I use this time to love my children each and every day. I work to raise money for my foundation for abused children and women as well as work on my memoir so I can tell my story and hopefully help someone’s desperite dry for help. I want so much to make a difference in this world. I feel it is my obligation, my purpose.!
 
 
 I want to make a program where woman can get help to get out of abuse. Most woman stay because they are told they are nothing, they can't make it without them, and they don’t have the money to get out and be independent.
My goal is to get them out and give them support. I want to have a stable home where they can go to  and have the protection they need. I want doctors to help them with what they have beenthrough. I want to find them secure job's. I want woman to become strong successful and independent.
As for the kid's who were abused I want so much more! They never asked to live that kind of life. All they want is a mother and father who will protect them not abuse them.  I am wishing my book could help change how people see and think about child abuse! When they hear a child screraming for the person abusing a child to stop! I HOPE THEY WOULD DO SOMETHING INTSTEAD OF NOTHING!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
Did you ever consider that Jesus was God as a baby? That He entered this world the same way your child did...or mine.

<h3></h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I see that you're interested, but being an inquisitive person, you still have some questions. Luckily, I have anticipated this:</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><b><br/></b></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><b>What Is Going On?</b></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">After three years, I have completed my novel and second work
of fiction, <i>The Albino Album (a novel as songs).</i></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This book is currently in editing with  a New York City based small press. The small press covers the costs of
editing, layout-and-design, printing and distribution, and some publicity. As you may know,
literature by emerging writers is not, initially at least, the most profitable enterprise. So, there is still much work to be done.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><b>What On Earth Will My Funds Be Used For?</b></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I need your help to fund my upcoming book tour for this work of literary fiction.The more this campaign generates, the larger my book tour will be. <b><br/></b></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">O will be working on publicity for
the book, as well as setting up a tour so that this book can reach an even
wider audience than the first. There are magazines, newspapers, bookstores, bars
and theaters to be contacted, bus tickets to buy, and where I don't have a host, motel rooms to be purchased. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><b>What is this Book Even About?</b><br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><i>The Albino Album (a novel as songs)</i> is a 200,000 word queer epic that follows
the life of a little girl who accidentally feeds her mother to an albino tiger
and grows up to become a domestic terrorist. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The Albino Album deals with issues
of queer identity, polyamory, rural poverty, pop music, gender, race in America,
Monsanto, the nonprofit conundrum and most importantly, the fantastic
implications of albino animals bred by pseudo-Nazis. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">If this is just the book
you didnï¿½t know you'd been waiting for, please donate today.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: 800;"">Can I <i>Please</i> Hear Just One Compelling, Albeit Slightly Unrelated, Interesting Fact?</span></p>
<span style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">An Interesting Fact: </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">Only two percent of what gets published
in the U.S. is literature (fiction, creative nonfiction, poetry, etc.) but Small
Presses publish more than 90% of literature in the U.S  </span><p class=""MsoNormal""><br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><b>Are There Any Other, Perhaps More Subjective Reasons to Donate?</b></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">By donating to this, you are supporting creative literature, and you can't go wrong there. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">You know how writers end up. This prolongs the time before that end, for me.<br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">If you want to see a book like this spread itself around
the country and support the work of a queer,female emerging novelist, this is a good
way to do it. <br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Maybe you're just in a giving mood.<br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Certain donation amounts get you perks, and my perks are really spectacular. <br/></p>
<h3><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">Any amount is greatly appreciated.</span></h3>
<h3><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">Thank you for all of your support!</span></h3>

</div></div>","I see that you're interested, but being an inquisitive person, you still have some questions. Luckily, I have anticipated this:

What Is Going On?
After three years, I have completed my novel and second work
of fiction, The Albino Album (a novel as songs).
This book is currently in editing with  a New York City based small press. The small press covers the costs of
editing, layout-and-design, printing and distribution, and some publicity. As you may know,
literature by emerging writers is not, initially at least, the most profitable enterprise. So, there is still much work to be done.

 
What On Earth Will My Funds Be Used For?
I need your help to fund my upcoming book tour for this work of literary fiction.The more this campaign generates, the larger my book tour will be. 
O will be working on publicity for
the book, as well as setting up a tour so that this book can reach an even
wider audience than the first. There are magazines, newspapers, bookstores, bars
and theaters to be contacted, bus tickets to buy, and where I don't have a host, motel rooms to be purchased. 

 
What is this Book Even About?
The Albino Album (a novel as songs) is a 200,000 word queer epic that follows
the life of a little girl who accidentally feeds her mother to an albino tiger
and grows up to become a domestic terrorist. 
The Albino Album deals with issues
of queer identity, polyamory, rural poverty, pop music, gender, race in America,
Monsanto, the nonprofit conundrum and most importantly, the fantastic
implications of albino animals bred by pseudo-Nazis. 
If this is just the book
you didnï¿½t know you'd been waiting for, please donate today.

 
Can I Please Hear Just One Compelling, Albeit Slightly Unrelated, Interesting Fact?
An Interesting Fact: Only two percent of what gets published
in the U.S. is literature (fiction, creative nonfiction, poetry, etc.) but Small
Presses publish more than 90% of literature in the U.S  
Are There Any Other, Perhaps More Subjective Reasons to Donate?
By donating to this, you are supporting creative literature, and you can't go wrong there. 
You know how writers end up. This prolongs the time before that end, for me.
If you want to see a book like this spread itself around
the country and support the work of a queer,female emerging novelist, this is a good
way to do it. 
Maybe you're just in a giving mood.
Certain donation amounts get you perks, and my perks are really spectacular. 
Any amount is greatly appreciated.
Thank you for all of your support!

<p><strong>ABOUT “POLLYANNA,” AND THE CAMPAIGN</strong></p>
<p><em>Pollyanna’s Tear Soaked Battlefields of Hollywood: A Survival Guide Against the Cynicism and the Hypocritical</em>, written by Emmy® Award Winner Orlando Delbert, is a true-to-life preparatory tale of what to expect when attempting to make it in Hollywood. A straightforward and unapologetic offering of real-life stories and events designed to steer the reader through the many pitfalls that everyone encounters.</p>
<p>Whether someone dreams of becoming a blockbuster director, an award winning actor, a platinum-selling recording artist, or any of the hundreds of other professions needed to be part of a Hollywood project, the foundations for success are the same. ‘Pollyanna’ makes it clear that talent alone is not always enough to succeed.</p>
<p>“Very few people that come to Hollywood stumble into success and prosperity without some kind of price to pay,” said Orlando Delbert. “Many people don’t even have a realistic plan when they arrive and honestly believe they will be discovered based on hubris or good looks alone.” Leaving trivial gossip at the door, Delbert offers an honest guide to reinforce the importance of planning, nurturing your inner strength, and becoming resilient enough to succeed.</p>
<p>If you think you have the talent, drive, and dedication to make it in Hollywood, then this book is for you.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT THE FUNDING IS FOR</strong></p>
<p>The first draft of “Pollyanna” has been completed and is in need of a final pass. Our editor has done a great job, but we feel there should be one more set of eyes to go through and make one final set of notes for possible revisions if needed. Funding will be for:</p>
<p>            • Additional Manuscript preparation and formatting</p>
<p>            • Copy-editing and proofreading</p>
<p>            • E-Conversion and delivery</p>
<p>We also need to assemble a marketing campaign. This will involve a marketing strategy that includes:</p>
<p>            • Press Releases</p>
<p>            • Video Promotions</p>
<p>            • Video Testimonials and Reviews</p>
<p>            • Online Presence including Social Media and Blogs</p>
<p>            • Additional artwork</p>
<p>Depending on the money that is raised, we may be offering a paperback first edition in the future.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOU GET FOR CONTRIBUTING</strong></p>
<p>As a contributor, you are part of a project that could help reduce hardship, including saving individuals from being sexually assaulted or raped, becoming homeless or left for dead. “Pollyanna” hopes to impact the many individuals desperate to become famous that lack life experience and the resilience to truly succeed.</p>
<p>You are also PRE-ORDERING a first edition of <em>Pollyanna’s Tear Soaked Battlefields of Hollywood: A Survival Guide Against the Cynicism and the Hypocritical</em> before the official release planned for March 2013. The book will be available as a digital download either as a PDF that can be read on mobile devices, as well as on your desktop computer, an EPUB file for most mobile devices, or a MOBI file for Kindle. </p>
<p><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></p>
<p>The beta readers have all agreed to the importance of “Pollyanna” as a tool, not only for success in the trenches of day-to-day life in Hollywood, but also for our personal lives as well. “Pollyanna” offers true stories that are seen daily in and around the entertainment industry. There are many toxic and predatory individuals taking advantage of the young and naïve. The book offers a brutally honest perspective of a side of “the biz” that few know exists!</p>

“Very few people that come to Hollywood stumble into success and prosperity without some kind of price to pay,” said Orlando Delbert. “Many people don’t even have a realistic plan when they arrive and honestly believe they will be discovered based on hubris or good looks alone.” Leaving trivial gossip at the door, Delbert offers an honest guide to reinforce the importance of planning, nurturing your inner strength, and becoming resilient enough to succeed.
If you think you have the talent, drive, and dedication to make it in Hollywood, then this book is for you.

WHAT THE FUNDING IS FOR
The first draft of “Pollyanna” has been completed and is in need of a final pass. Our editor has done a great job, but we feel there should be one more set of eyes to go through and make one final set of notes for possible revisions if needed. Funding will be for:
            • Additional Manuscript preparation and formatting
            • Copy-editing and proofreading
            • E-Conversion and delivery
We also need to assemble a marketing campaign. This will involve a marketing strategy that includes:
            • Press Releases
            • Video Promotions
            • Video Testimonials and Reviews
            • Online Presence including Social Media and Blogs
            • Additional artwork
Depending on the money that is raised, we may be offering a paperback first edition in the future.
WHAT YOU GET FOR CONTRIBUTING
As a contributor, you are part of a project that could help reduce hardship, including saving individuals from being sexually assaulted or raped, becoming homeless or left for dead. “Pollyanna” hopes to impact the many individuals desperate to become famous that lack life experience and the resilience to truly succeed.
You are also PRE-ORDERING a first edition of Pollyanna’s Tear Soaked Battlefields of Hollywood: A Survival Guide Against the Cynicism and the Hypocritical before the official release planned for March 2013. The book will be available as a digital download either as a PDF that can be read on mobile devices, as well as on your desktop computer, an EPUB file for most mobile devices, or a MOBI file for Kindle. 
THE IMPACT
The beta readers have all agreed to the importance of “Pollyanna” as a tool, not only for success in the trenches of day-to-day life in Hollywood, but also for our personal lives as well. “Pollyanna” offers true stories that are seen daily in and around the entertainment industry. There are many toxic and predatory individuals taking advantage of the young and naïve. The book offers a brutally honest perspective of a side of “the biz” that few know exists!

REVIEWS

“I only wish I had this when I went to LA my first time all those years ago. Honest, poignant and wholly true. The ""real"" Good, Bad and the Ugly - The L.A. Manual.”
Visual Effects Supervisor Frank Rosowski.

“He doesn’t pull any punches (nor should he) when it comes to the ‘source material’ of life in the Hollywood trenches. His total honesty is refreshing in a sea of many sharks that populate the Hollywood landscape with their half-truths and lies just to get what they want out of the unsuspecting neophyte.”
Film Director and Producer Wendell Hubbard.

“It automatically gets you hooked. (A) book that will engage a wide audience, from students eager to jump into it -- to the people who have been there and done that -- and everyone in between.”
Founder and Artistic Director of ‘Circ X’ Diana Lozano.

“Mr. Delbert lays it all on the line and pulls no punches when it comes to dishing the dirt on Hollywood’s entertainment industry. He does so without coming off as being bitter or broken himself.”
Filmmaker Deana Becker.

“This universal book isn’t just for Hollywood; it can be used across the board for your personal life.”
Assistant Director Tharian “Ty” Dunn.

“This book is a must have for anyone ever considering going into show business! Orlando Delbert has written an amazing account of his journey through a side of Hollywood we never knew existed. Pollyanna's Tear Soaked Battlefields of Hollywood has earned its place on my bookshelf.”
Ariel Nadav.

<p>Before starting university, I wondered a lot about what might happen to my life. I thought that I might <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">live in a shared and colourful apartment with a lot of strange and interesting people. I thought that I </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">might drink a lot of alcohol and forget everything the day after. I thought that I would list my lovers and </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">compare mine with my flatmates’ …to win a condom!</span></p>
<p>Actually, some of these things happened for real!  Other things that happened to me in those three <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">years of university, I couldn't even have begun to imagine. To find out all the delicious details you will </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">just have to read on.</span></p>
<p>So, I started to write a blog about my adventures and now I am writing an e-book.

<p>It’s no ordinary e-book. It’s funny, it’s educational, it’s amusing, it’s true, it’s an emotional rollercoaster <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">ride but above all, it's a survival manual for students.</span></p>

<p>My e-book is not just a narrative about university life style; it'spart story, part manual for students. </p>
<p>When I chose to go to university, I knew so little about that world; I wished I could have known more <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">and been better prepared. I think it could be useful to learn more about that particular world and about </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">what you might face in that period of life.</span></p>

But when a drunken night results in an unwanted pregnancy, her perfect life is turned upside down and she’s faced with an impossible decision. </i></p>
<p><i>Katherine Frayne has always wanted to be a mother. But with the last results of her in vitro pointing to no baby, she thinks there’s no hope. Then her husband Danny suggests they adopt. At first Kat is resistant, but she soon realizes that it may be her only chance at being a mom.  </i></p>

<br/><p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Here’s the deets:</p>
<p><i>Game Plan</i> is author Natalie Corbett Sampson's debut young adult novel. As an adoptive mother herself, this was a very personal story for her to write.

<h3>Our Need</h3>
<p>On January 6-8, 2012 we'll host our first winter retreat and to have the biggest impact we want to reduce the cost of our retreat from $88 to $30 for the first 30 who register. The cost will include all retreat activities, meals and lodging. We also want to sponsor up to seven young adults who can't afford to pay to attend the retreat. In addition, the funds raised will allow us to launch an improved website/blog and apply for 501(c)(3) status.

Story
My name is Monica Castillo, and I'm
the senior film critic for a humble college magazine, the Quad. You know, for
kicks and giggles, and sleepless nights. My quest is to expand our coverage beyond
the cloistered confines of New England. I plan on providing a college student's
insight into one of the premiere film festivals in the world, South by
Southwest. 
I threw in my application to SXSW just for the hell of it. Well, surprise! They
accepted me, and I got my press pass. Cue dance sequence!
Bad news has since brought me back down to earth. The Quad is run by student
volunteers with no funding from the school, and my parents, unimpressed, are
not donating to the cause. So I've emptied my savings account in order to get
this once-in-a-lifetime chance. 
But now my pockets are bare. I need the help of faithful readers and benevolent
do-gooders such as yourself.
Help send me from Boston to Austin! 
The
Impact
Help make my dreams come true! You'll
also get a unique youthful insight into the SXSW Film Festival. It'll be a
one-woman showdown with tons of events, lots of ground to cover, and a city
I've never seen. I've got my laptop, a camera, and video equipment ready to go.
You can follow my coverage on the Quad’s twitter feed and at buquad.com. All I
need now are funds in order to help keep me fed and off the streets of Austin. 
We need more college voices in today’s
media. There are plenty of established critics attending festivals to just
report on the movies they see. But film festivals are an experience, one that readers
should get to learn about. What better way to report to a college audience than
with a fellow, wide-eyed college student?
What
We Need & What You Get
The damage:
Plane Ticket: $339
Hotel (before tax): $375
Transportation: ~$50
Feed Me (Please): ~50
Estimated amount I'll probably go
over anyway: $814
Experience: Priceless
 
But, I won't leave you empty handed.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, our names are Rita Costa, Gary Dougall and Ines Costa. We are the authors of the relatively obscure book <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Drinking-Games-inspired-Shows-ebook/dp/B008CL6EBS/ref=sr_1_8?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1340102701&amp;sr=1-8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Damn it""</a>. We are currently writing a book about the hard economic times that have befallen Europe recently. We need your help!</p>
<p>We are not economists, we are normal people who watch way too much CNN and believe humour is the best remedy at times like this. </p>
<p>We will explain the recession in a semi-serious way. We will advise you on job searching, CV building, how to save money, etc.</p>
<p>Some of the chapters finished (we have written about 100 pages so far) are:<br/>- Saving Money<br/>- An Idiot's Guide to Job Hunting<br/>- How to become a Mortuary Agent<br/>- Who Should We Blame<br/>- Is Crime The Answer<br/>- Yay You're a Geek<br/>and many more!</p>

<p><b>The Project: </b></p>
<p>Hi and thanks for stopping by. My name
is Chad Goller-Sojourner.  I am a
Seattle-based writer, performer, transracial adoptee, <span>and the creator of two solo performances: <i>Sitting in Circles with Rich White Girls:
Memoirs of a Bulimic Black Boy</i> and <i>Riding in Cars with Black People &amp; Other Newly Dangerous Acts: A
Memoir in Vanishing Whiteness. </i>Most recently I was featured on NPR’s Weekend Edition Sunday, in segment entitled: “Growing Up
'White,' Transracial Adoptee Learned To Be Black.”</span></p>
<p></p><p>I plan to complete, publish and promote my new book,<i>From Lutefisk and Lefse to Cornbread and Collards:
Narratives, Essays and Interactive Exercises in Transracial Adoption.</i> Each
chapter opens with narratives taken from the above referenced memoirs, followed
by expository essays. Essays which, among other topics, explore and address the
paradoxical relationship between transracial adoptees and something I like to
call honorary white privilege. A privilege based on parentage rather than
personhood, and known to vanish quickly upon the adoptee leaving home an act
which often leaves the transracial adoptee ill-equipped and saddled with a
handicapped and fragmentary racial identity.</p>
<p>In the third and final section I present a series of
Interactive Exercises, providing both concrete tools and best practices as they
relate to adoptive parents and transracial adoptees. For the adoptive parents,
raising transracial children, for both this world and the one they will one day
age into. For the transracial adoptee, creating a world where conflicting
experiences can be claimed, transformed, and accepted for what they are: the
building blocks of our unique identities.</p>
<p>As the number
of transracial adoptions continues to rise, the voice of the adult transracial
adoptee becomes all the more important. Currently, the vast majority of
transracial adoption literature is written by white adoptive parents. And while
this is an important lens, when it comes to creating <span><span>and navigating a healthy
racial and ethnic identity, one where whiteness is the background, it is the</span>
adult transracial adoptee <span>who is the expert. For many of us older adoptees, we are also the expert
when it comes to taking on our adoptive parent’s racial and ethnic identity, only
to see our honorary white identity and privileges vanish upon leaving home. Thankfully,
it no longer has to be that way. With your </span>financial and
promotional assistance,<span> <i>“</i></span><i>From Lutefisk and Lefse to Cornbread and
Collards</i>,” can <span>serve
as an</span> important, necessary and
relevant<span> resource for transracial families. So what
do you say, can we make this happen?</span></span></p><p><b><i>“With white

When I have shared portions of it with others they were encouraged and inspired in living out their calling, yet I still hadn't completed and officially released the book. I've recently been reminded of how selfish that can be, to have God's word burning within me to share with others and letting any excuse or reason stand in the way. As the book nears completion there are just a few loose ends that I can't afford on my own, but I've been encouraged by friends to not let such things deter me from my calling and that the God who has called me to share this encouragement for others will be faithful to bring it to completion. <br/><br/>Honestly, when I think about those things it completely overwhelms me. I'm the youth pastor of a small youth group and a frequent contributor to an e-publication. When I think of those things I don't see myself as better than others, but I do see myself in a position to continue to serve. My hope is that this book will be able to reach a great number of people so that it can serve them. The hope is that:</p><ul>

</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The creative spirit will find renewed vigor.</span></li>

</ul></div>","Creative in God's Image - the time is now.Creative in God's Image is a book that has been burning within me for a few years. When I have shared portions of it with others they were encouraged and inspired in living out their calling, yet I still hadn't completed and officially released the book. I've recently been reminded of how selfish that can be, to have God's word burning within me to share with others and letting any excuse or reason stand in the way. As the book nears completion there are just a few loose ends that I can't afford on my own, but I've been encouraged by friends to not let such things deter me from my calling and that the God who has called me to share this encouragement for others will be faithful to bring it to completion. Honestly, when I think about those things it completely overwhelms me. I'm the youth pastor of a small youth group and a frequent contributor to an e-publication. When I think of those things I don't see myself as better than others, but I do see myself in a position to continue to serve. My hope is that this book will be able to reach a great number of people so that it can serve them. The hope is that:
The burned out will find a new spark.
The exhausted will find renewed energy.

The discouraged will find both encouragement and true courage to press on.

The creative spirit will find renewed vigor.
That worship will stop being routine and will start being expressed in offices, playgrounds, schools, warehouses, and all other places where God's people are dwelling and finding that their creativity inspired from above means that life here on earth can be good and a blessing to many.
What We Need & What You Get.The truth is I've undershot what the true cost of self-publishing would be these days, but kind friends have been willing to help me on my way at reduced rates:
There are many moving cogs to creating a book well and a content editor, graphic designer, programmer (to convert to the various e-publication formats), studio recording for the audiobook, and acquiring the proper rights and identifications for a publication so that it can be protected and also shared to the widest possible audience all cost a good sum of money.
We're really excited about sharing this message, though, and want you to be excited to help. Anyone who contributes at even the lowest level will be given a digital copy of the book in their preferred format when it is released. However, the perks only get more exciting from there. 
This book is designed to be coupled with a workshop that should help inspire and encourage your church, university, work or other group. I have been tailoring that experience so that I can do it a few ways, but would love to come share it with our top contributors.

<p></p><p><i>The Amazing True
Imaginary Autobiography of Dick and Jani</i>  traces the lives of my grandmothers, both born during WWI (before
women had the right to vote), but who cut two very different paths through their
lives.  Dick was on the surface a
one-dimensional, frustrated housewife (who was anything but), whereas Jani
rebelled loudly against the conventions of marriage and motherhood, yet never
stopped trying to find love, even after she crashed out of her third marriage
on her way to becoming a feminist teacher in the 1970s.  </p><p>Dick and Jani's voices and experience offer a fresh perspective
on the 20th Century.  Their lives as women who were neither famous nor
infamous were restricted, but their witness is no less valuable for that.
 Their choices - as women born into modest circumstances but who had
outsized dreams - could not have been more different.  Their story is a
study in contrasts, between the soul-crushing cost of conformity paid by Dick
and the price of Jani's very flamboyant rebellion against the role she was told
she should play.  </p><p>In other words, their perspectives offer a micro-history* of the
time in which they lived and their experience is valuable as a mirror into our
own time.  I have come to realize that
without hearing and understanding our grandmothers' stories, we are impoverished
for lack of deep knowledge of our own history. 
This book is a humble attempt to begin to redress that balance. </p><p>I am requesting your help to complete this project now, because
after three years of working on the book (which has included extensive research), which I've done between other commitments and employment,
the final stage of research and drafting of this book requires my entire focus
without other distractions to complete. Any help you can give will be
gratefully received, whether it's $1 or $1,000, will be used solely to fund the
writing of this book.  </p><p><b>SO WHAT'S
YOUR STORY?</b></p><p>My background professionally and academically is in writing
and directing theater and its relationship to philosophy.  I have won awards
and had my plays published and produced internationally.  I have spent most of my adult life in NYC, except for 8 years living and working in London from 2003- 2011. 
In 2010, having just completed a Ph.D. while running <b><a href=""http://www.flyingoutofsequence.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Apocryphal Theatre</a></b>, my
father had a massive heart attack in Sacramento, California.  I arrived a day before he died, just in time
to say goodbye to someone I barely knew.  </p><p><b><u>Who's Dick?</u></b></p><p><b><u><b><b><b><b></b></b></b></b><b><b><b><b></b></b></b></b></u></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/516438/files/20140417220218-Dick_George.jpg?1397797338"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>In the week following my father's death, I was sorting
through his storage locker when I came upon old pictures of my grandmother
(Betty aka 'Dick'). I discovered in these photos and documents - beginning with
her baby photo and including such items as War Ration stamps and my father's baby
book - a woman and a time I had never known.  I had only known her as Nana - a frustrated woman who kept her house and heart like an Ethan Allen furniture
showroom and seemed eternally disappointed in life and my mild-mannered
grandfather - who<span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px;""> was saddled with taking care of me as a young child and again
as a young teen when my father or mother could not.  These photographs of
her as a happy teenager and young woman showed me a life before the many losses
of her life took their toll, beginning with the death of her dream of being an
artist when the art classes in her high school were cut during the Depression
and, to help her struggling family, she went to work in a rubber factory in her
hometown of Seymour, Connecticut.  </span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/516441/files/20140417220317-Dick_Girl.jpg?1397797397"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px;"">I never thought I would write about Dick, because she
and I had a difficult relationship, which was intimately entwined with my
chaotic childhood and her fear and loathing of
disorder.  However, as I began to pore through her old photos, including news clippings from youthful triumphs in
plays and fashion shows, I learned more about her background, including my
grandfather's need to change the family name from Bukoski to Barclay because
his boss told him his name sounded 'too Red' when he was working as an
Executive Secretary on the Manhattan Project.  I began to understand that her story was
one of the many untold stories of the 20th Century.  However, in any book or movie, she would
appear - if at all - as a joke, a footnote, a brief unpleasantness - she would
never be viewed as a whole person.  I
realized her story needed to be deeply heard and understood for a more full
accounting of our own history.  Unlocking
her history unlocked the true shape of this book.</span><br/></p><p><u><b>Who's</b> <b>Jani?</b></u></p><p><u><b></b></u></p><p><u><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/516498/files/20140417224228-Activist_Jani_1a.jpg?1397799748"" src="""" style=""""/></b></u></p><p></p><p>I had always known I wanted to write about my other, more
glamorous grandmother, the one who crashed out of three violent marriages, got pregnant
and married as a teenager to a Harvard drop-out Merchant Marine, Russell - her ticket out of Toledo, Ohio to a more cosmopolitan Bostonian family - but who
she divorced when he left on one more spree.  She then married a reporter - Bob, my
grandfather, right before WWII began.  She lived and worked in post-War Vienna with my him until he
decided to marry his lovely Viennese secretary. Reeling from that loss, she
grasped onto her final, ill-fated third marriage to a Southern engineer named
Earl during which she fell into a pill-induced haze of 1950s housewifery, which she
clawed herself out of by getting a college education and teacher's degree in 1966. I
met her for the first time I remember in the 1970s, when she was single, a
teacher in the Milwaukee public school system, an active feminist and wore
mini-skirts, white go-go boots and smoked cigars.  What's not to love?
 </p><p>However, I never lived with Jani (which is the name by
which I knew her).  She was a mythical figure who careened through our
lives from time to time - who frankly scared me - until the summer of 1979, which we
spent together in Peaks Island, Maine, when she was 63 and  dying of lung cancer, and I
was 16 and taking care of her:<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/516501/files/20140417224722-01_Jani_06_2a.jpg?1397800042"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px;"">That summer she showed me some of her photos from
her girlhood and we reconciled over arguments we had had about the fact I
wanted to be an artist rather than a physicist (her idea), when she confessed
she, too, had wanted to go to NYC to study theater, but her parents had said no.  </span><br/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">When I began my research in earnest for this book in 2011, I traveled to my </span><span style=""line-height: 22.80000114440918px;"">mother's and cousin's homes to</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> read Jani's letters and writing that were in their possession.  I was confronted with
aspects of her life that I had not suspected.  She had been my feminist
super-hero, but what I was reading was disillusioning - in both a good and bad
way.  In place of hero-worship, there is
now an understanding of her as a human being. 
I am almost done with reading her copious amounts of writing - correspondence,
poems, published articles, stories, book drafts, legislation (she was
instrumental in getting the rape laws changed in Wisconsin after someone made
the mistake of trying to rape her in 1974) - and sorting through the legacy of
this deeply complex and intriguing person. 
She was a self-mythologizer who was an extremely effective organizer, an
excellent op-ed writer who aspired to publish her fiction, a very strong woman
who wanted nothing more at times than to be held, who was both tireless and
exhausted.  She died too young of lung
cancer, and was mourned by many, including her inner-city students in Milwaukee
when she died.  </span><br/></p><p><b><u>Why Dick and
Jani?</u></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/516450/files/20140417221335-Two_Lives_1950s.jpg?1397798015"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; font-size: 16px;"">As I began to piece together all the photos and documents
for both women, I began to understand that their story was more than I had
suspected, not only because no one's life is as simple as it may appear on the
outside, especially to a child, but because they had lived through and
participated in so many aspects of the 20th Century, but not from the
traditional point of view we hear about it in our history books (WWII is about
the battles and the homecoming of the men, not the women working as reporters
or organizing army wives in Chicago - like Jani - or - in the case of Dick -
being the wife of a man too physically small to fight who's beloved brother
died in the Pacific; the Depression is seen from the point of view of the
adults rather than the teenagers whose dreams must be deferred; the Women's
Movement in the 1970s is usually the story of young women, not newly liberated
grandmothers in their fifties).</span><br/></p><p>I am writing the book from their points of view, because I want
you to hear their voices and see through their eyes.  This is where my theater training comes in
handy, because as a writer and a director, I am used to perceiving life from multiple
points of view.  I am using Dick and
Jani's own words from letters and documents, memories of them (mine and
others') and my imagination.  As anyone
knows who has ever tried to research their own family history, there is
mythology (and sometimes outright lies of omission and commission) built into every story, so if these two
women were here today to tell their stories, those stories' would be unreliable - in the same way my own autobiography would be, because we see ourselves through convenient scrims.  While, of course, my view, too, is ultimately
subjective, I have been doing years of research - of their own writing, photos
and the history surrounding them, their husbands, parents and grandparents,
great-grandparents and so on - in order to understand as well as humanly
possible how these astonishing women understood their own lives.</p><p><b>WHERE DOES
MY MONEY GO?  </b></p><p>What I am asking for in this campaign is simple: money to pay
for time.  Time to complete the research
and a draft of this book, which, given the work I have done so far over the
past three years, and assuming I raise enough funds to focus on this project
over the summer, I should be able to complete by the autumn.  </p><p>I will then submit the work to an agent who has expressed
interest in reading it and go from there. If I cannot find a
traditional publisher for the book, I will publish the book independently.  Therefore, you can be assured, if you donate
to this campaign, the book will indeed materialize.  </p><p>I will stay in touch with all contributors to this campaign to
let you know how things are going up to when the book is published and in
regard to any perks you claimed.  What
gave me the courage to reach out for funding in this way was a friend of my mother's who spontaneously
gave me money to help my research for the book, because she wanted to feel a
part of it, which of course now she is. 
I want anyone who donates to this campaign, no matter what
the amount, to feel a part of it, because you will be.  No writer creates alone.  There are people who support us without whom
we would simply vanish.  Anyone who says
different is lying.</p><p>If I do not receive the full amount I am seeking, I will use the
amount received to work on the book, so your donation will not go to waste. If I reach my goal or - even better - surpass it - the quicker the book will be completed, because I will have the unimpeded time to do so, but no matter
what, the book will be completed.</p><p>I have a history of completing large and seemingly impossible
projects, so you can have confidence that I will complete this one.  I have run two, critically acclaimed independent theater companies
in NYC and London (getting funding for both and doctoral research as an
American in the UK); led multi-year theater laboratories; and written, produced and directed
complex productions since the 1980s.  Most of my plays are published in anthologies and online at <b><b><b><b><a href=""http://www.indietheaternow.com/Playwright/julia-lee-barclay"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Indie Theater Now</a>.</b></b></b></b>  I
received a Ph.D. in 2009 from University of Northampton in the UK arguing that
theater can be an act of philosophy and my BA with High Honors in Theater in

The Amazing True
Imaginary Autobiography of Dick and Jani  traces the lives of my grandmothers, both born during WWI (before
women had the right to vote), but who cut two very different paths through their
lives.  Dick was on the surface a
one-dimensional, frustrated housewife (who was anything but), whereas Jani
rebelled loudly against the conventions of marriage and motherhood, yet never
stopped trying to find love, even after she crashed out of her third marriage
on her way to becoming a feminist teacher in the 1970s.  Dick and Jani's voices and experience offer a fresh perspective
on the 20th Century.  Their lives as women who were neither famous nor
infamous were restricted, but their witness is no less valuable for that.
 Their choices - as women born into modest circumstances but who had
outsized dreams - could not have been more different.  Their story is a
study in contrasts, between the soul-crushing cost of conformity paid by Dick
and the price of Jani's very flamboyant rebellion against the role she was told
she should play.  In other words, their perspectives offer a micro-history* of the
time in which they lived and their experience is valuable as a mirror into our
own time.  I have come to realize that
without hearing and understanding our grandmothers' stories, we are impoverished
for lack of deep knowledge of our own history. 
This book is a humble attempt to begin to redress that balance. I am requesting your help to complete this project now, because
after three years of working on the book (which has included extensive research), which I've done between other commitments and employment,
the final stage of research and drafting of this book requires my entire focus
without other distractions to complete. Any help you can give will be
gratefully received, whether it's $1 or $1,000, will be used solely to fund the
writing of this book.  SO WHAT'S
YOUR STORY?My background professionally and academically is in writing
and directing theater and its relationship to philosophy.  I have won awards
and had my plays published and produced internationally.  I have spent most of my adult life in NYC, except for 8 years living and working in London from 2003- 2011. 
In 2010, having just completed a Ph.D. while running Apocryphal Theatre, my
father had a massive heart attack in Sacramento, California.  I arrived a day before he died, just in time
to say goodbye to someone I barely knew.  Who's Dick?In the week following my father's death, I was sorting
through his storage locker when I came upon old pictures of my grandmother
(Betty aka 'Dick'). I discovered in these photos and documents - beginning with
her baby photo and including such items as War Ration stamps and my father's baby
book - a woman and a time I had never known.  I had only known her as Nana - a frustrated woman who kept her house and heart like an Ethan Allen furniture
showroom and seemed eternally disappointed in life and my mild-mannered
grandfather - who was saddled with taking care of me as a young child and again
as a young teen when my father or mother could not.  These photographs of
her as a happy teenager and young woman showed me a life before the many losses
of her life took their toll, beginning with the death of her dream of being an
artist when the art classes in her high school were cut during the Depression
and, to help her struggling family, she went to work in a rubber factory in her
hometown of Seymour, Connecticut.  I never thought I would write about Dick, because she
and I had a difficult relationship, which was intimately entwined with my
chaotic childhood and her fear and loathing of
disorder.  However, as I began to pore through her old photos, including news clippings from youthful triumphs in
plays and fashion shows, I learned more about her background, including my
grandfather's need to change the family name from Bukoski to Barclay because
his boss told him his name sounded 'too Red' when he was working as an
Executive Secretary on the Manhattan Project.  I began to understand that her story was
one of the many untold stories of the 20th Century.  However, in any book or movie, she would
appear - if at all - as a joke, a footnote, a brief unpleasantness - she would
never be viewed as a whole person.  I
realized her story needed to be deeply heard and understood for a more full
accounting of our own history.  Unlocking
her history unlocked the true shape of this book.Who's Jani?I had always known I wanted to write about my other, more
glamorous grandmother, the one who crashed out of three violent marriages, got pregnant
and married as a teenager to a Harvard drop-out Merchant Marine, Russell - her ticket out of Toledo, Ohio to a more cosmopolitan Bostonian family - but who
she divorced when he left on one more spree.  She then married a reporter - Bob, my
grandfather, right before WWII began.  She lived and worked in post-War Vienna with my him until he
decided to marry his lovely Viennese secretary. Reeling from that loss, she
grasped onto her final, ill-fated third marriage to a Southern engineer named
Earl during which she fell into a pill-induced haze of 1950s housewifery, which she
clawed herself out of by getting a college education and teacher's degree in 1966. I
met her for the first time I remember in the 1970s, when she was single, a
teacher in the Milwaukee public school system, an active feminist and wore
mini-skirts, white go-go boots and smoked cigars.  What's not to love?
 However, I never lived with Jani (which is the name by
which I knew her).  She was a mythical figure who careened through our
lives from time to time - who frankly scared me - until the summer of 1979, which we
spent together in Peaks Island, Maine, when she was 63 and  dying of lung cancer, and I
was 16 and taking care of her: That summer she showed me some of her photos from
her girlhood and we reconciled over arguments we had had about the fact I
wanted to be an artist rather than a physicist (her idea), when she confessed
she, too, had wanted to go to NYC to study theater, but her parents had said no.  When I began my research in earnest for this book in 2011, I traveled to my mother's and cousin's homes to read Jani's letters and writing that were in their possession.  I was confronted with
aspects of her life that I had not suspected.  She had been my feminist
super-hero, but what I was reading was disillusioning - in both a good and bad
way.  In place of hero-worship, there is
now an understanding of her as a human being. 
I am almost done with reading her copious amounts of writing - correspondence,
poems, published articles, stories, book drafts, legislation (she was
instrumental in getting the rape laws changed in Wisconsin after someone made
the mistake of trying to rape her in 1974) - and sorting through the legacy of
this deeply complex and intriguing person. 
She was a self-mythologizer who was an extremely effective organizer, an
excellent op-ed writer who aspired to publish her fiction, a very strong woman
who wanted nothing more at times than to be held, who was both tireless and
exhausted.  She died too young of lung
cancer, and was mourned by many, including her inner-city students in Milwaukee
when she died.  Why Dick and
Jani?As I began to piece together all the photos and documents
for both women, I began to understand that their story was more than I had
suspected, not only because no one's life is as simple as it may appear on the
outside, especially to a child, but because they had lived through and
participated in so many aspects of the 20th Century, but not from the
traditional point of view we hear about it in our history books (WWII is about
the battles and the homecoming of the men, not the women working as reporters
or organizing army wives in Chicago - like Jani - or - in the case of Dick -
being the wife of a man too physically small to fight who's beloved brother
died in the Pacific; the Depression is seen from the point of view of the
adults rather than the teenagers whose dreams must be deferred; the Women's
Movement in the 1970s is usually the story of young women, not newly liberated
grandmothers in their fifties).I am writing the book from their points of view, because I want
you to hear their voices and see through their eyes.  This is where my theater training comes in
handy, because as a writer and a director, I am used to perceiving life from multiple
points of view.  I am using Dick and
Jani's own words from letters and documents, memories of them (mine and
others') and my imagination.  As anyone
knows who has ever tried to research their own family history, there is
mythology (and sometimes outright lies of omission and commission) built into every story, so if these two
women were here today to tell their stories, those stories' would be unreliable - in the same way my own autobiography would be, because we see ourselves through convenient scrims.  While, of course, my view, too, is ultimately
subjective, I have been doing years of research - of their own writing, photos
and the history surrounding them, their husbands, parents and grandparents,
great-grandparents and so on - in order to understand as well as humanly
possible how these astonishing women understood their own lives.WHERE DOES
MY MONEY GO?  What I am asking for in this campaign is simple: money to pay
for time.  Time to complete the research
and a draft of this book, which, given the work I have done so far over the
past three years, and assuming I raise enough funds to focus on this project
over the summer, I should be able to complete by the autumn.  I will then submit the work to an agent who has expressed
interest in reading it and go from there. If I cannot find a
traditional publisher for the book, I will publish the book independently.  Therefore, you can be assured, if you donate
to this campaign, the book will indeed materialize.  I will stay in touch with all contributors to this campaign to
let you know how things are going up to when the book is published and in
regard to any perks you claimed.  What
gave me the courage to reach out for funding in this way was a friend of my mother's who spontaneously
gave me money to help my research for the book, because she wanted to feel a
part of it, which of course now she is. 
I want anyone who donates to this campaign, no matter what
the amount, to feel a part of it, because you will be.  No writer creates alone.  There are people who support us without whom
we would simply vanish.  Anyone who says
different is lying.If I do not receive the full amount I am seeking, I will use the
amount received to work on the book, so your donation will not go to waste. If I reach my goal or - even better - surpass it - the quicker the book will be completed, because I will have the unimpeded time to do so, but no matter
what, the book will be completed.I have a history of completing large and seemingly impossible
projects, so you can have confidence that I will complete this one.  I have run two, critically acclaimed independent theater companies
in NYC and London (getting funding for both and doctoral research as an
American in the UK); led multi-year theater laboratories; and written, produced and directed
complex productions since the 1980s.  Most of my plays are published in anthologies and online at Indie Theater Now.  I
received a Ph.D. in 2009 from University of Northampton in the UK arguing that
theater can be an act of philosophy and my BA with High Honors in Theater in
1986 from Wesleyan University in the US. 
My blog Somewhere in Transition, begun in 2011, traces the many shifts in my life that followed upon the disbanding of my company in London and includes a lot of information about the process of researching and writing this book.  WHAT DO I
GET IN RETURN?Besides my undying gratitude and a special place in heaven for those who give to crowd-source funding campaigns, below are the perks on offer at various contribution levels,

<p><b>BIG THANKS TO EVERYONE WHO CONTRIBUTED AND TOOK PART IN OUR CAMPAIGN! </b></p>

<p>The Mindful Word is a collective of individuals committed to creating a culture of engaged living. The practice of mindfulness is the starting point for this cultural transition. Rather than exploring mindfulness in isolation, The Mindful Word aims to further integrate mindfulness in everyday life by exploring other aspects of engaged living such as the slow movement, permaculture and contemplative arts for the mindfulness characteristics they share.</p>
<h2>What we do</h2>
<p>We publish a daily blog and a quarterly digital magazine that reaches over 30,000 people a month. Both are freely accessible at <a href=""http://www.themindfulword.org."" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.themindfulword.org%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.themindfulword.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.themindfulword.org</a>, and both are freely available for reprinting, copying, distribution and alteration under a Creative Commons license. The blog features content from a variety of topics in web-friendly format. The digital magazine is a different medium geared towards longer reads and features some of the top articles not found on the website. </p>
<p>Since launching in 2007 our intention has been to provide a space for writers, editors, photographers and designers to collaborate with like-minded people in a collective environment. </p>
<p>We feel that when people are engaged in their work by taking ownership in it they care more about they're doing and in the end, the readers and users of the site benefit. So we've recently started a worker co-operative to provide a joint ownership platform to those who create content for The Mindful Word. Since we're just launching it, we need help getting it off the ground.<br/></p>
<h2>4 reasons to give</h2>
<p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">1. Writing, editing and design </b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">- Though we've been operating using volunteer help until now, there's a limit to the amount of time and effort that can be asked of volunteers, so to consistently provide readers with quality articles and to move forward with new developments, such as offering a moderated discussion forum, we need to pay our writers and editors for their contributions to the digital magazine and website as well as our designer, who has been faithfully creating layouts and images for each issue free of charge, for the last year.</span><br/></p>
<p><b>2. Collective ownership </b>- The Mindful Word was founded as a collective where anyone who has an interest can get involved and use the forum as a way to engage themselves and the world. We feel that writing is a fantastic medium for personal and collective transformation that supports a deepening of one's own practice. To provide consistent, quality service to our readers while also moving forward with this vision of collaborative creativity, we’ve recently opened up ownership like a worker co-operative where contributors can take part in decisions and take ownership in their work. But to properly make this transition, we need start-up funding to provide contributors with some upfront payment for their work in addition to the revenue sharing they make as members of the collective, which is minimal when just starting out. </p>
<p><b>3. Events &amp; charitable initiatives</b> - In addition to publishing stories about living a mindful, engaged life, The Mindful Word has hosted events where people can gain hands-on experience doing the kind of things we write about. We’d like to do more of that because we feel that reading about something is just the starting point and experiential learning is where the deepest lessons are learned. The same goes for charitable initiatives, which we’re looking to undertake. But before doing so, we need to get the website and magazine operating sustainably.</p>
<p><b>4. Digital magazine </b>- Our digital magazine is both ad-free and free to subscribe. We'd like to keep it that way, but since our subscriber list has grown we now have to pay to send emails out to our list. (if you haven't already done so, <a href=""http://www.themindfulword.org/magazine/subscribe/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.themindfulword.org/magazine/subscribe/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">sign up for a free subscription here</a>). <br/></p>
<h2><b>Where the money goes</b></h2>
<p>Our funding target is $8,000, which will fund operations for this transition year, providing the necessary upfront payment to writers, editors and the designer, after which point the upfront payments will no longer be necessary because we expect the contributors will be funded wholly by revenue sharing.</p>
<p>Contributions will also cover our design costs of $300 per issue, emailout costs of approximately $50 per issue and the rest going towards paying writers and editors. <br/></p>
<p>If we do meet our target, donors will get an additional perk: pick the themes for our four digital magazine issues next year, and suggest particular story ideas you'd like to see featured in those issues!</p>
<p>If we don't manage to raise $8,000, we won't take the money and run—we'll just have to lower the payments to our contributing writers and editors a bit. If we don’t meet the target, we also won’t be able to organize our issues according to specific themes. <br/></p>
<p>Since a great deal of political and economic unrest exists in the world, it's more important than ever to promote a culture of peace, tolerance and mindfulness. If you're able to help us disseminate our ideas as widely and with as much impact as possible, we will be grateful for your support. You'll be recognized for your contribution in our spring 2014 issue, on our website and our social media pages, if you so choose, and you'll receive a gift which you can choose from on the right.</p>

The Mindful Word is a collective of individuals committed to creating a culture of engaged living. The practice of mindfulness is the starting point for this cultural transition. Rather than exploring mindfulness in isolation, The Mindful Word aims to further integrate mindfulness in everyday life by exploring other aspects of engaged living such as the slow movement, permaculture and contemplative arts for the mindfulness characteristics they share.
What we do
We publish a daily blog and a quarterly digital magazine that reaches over 30,000 people a month. Both are freely accessible at www.themindfulword.org, and both are freely available for reprinting, copying, distribution and alteration under a Creative Commons license. The blog features content from a variety of topics in web-friendly format. The digital magazine is a different medium geared towards longer reads and features some of the top articles not found on the website. 
Since launching in 2007 our intention has been to provide a space for writers, editors, photographers and designers to collaborate with like-minded people in a collective environment. 
We feel that when people are engaged in their work by taking ownership in it they care more about they're doing and in the end, the readers and users of the site benefit. So we've recently started a worker co-operative to provide a joint ownership platform to those who create content for The Mindful Word. Since we're just launching it, we need help getting it off the ground.
4 reasons to give
1. Writing, editing and design - Though we've been operating using volunteer help until now, there's a limit to the amount of time and effort that can be asked of volunteers, so to consistently provide readers with quality articles and to move forward with new developments, such as offering a moderated discussion forum, we need to pay our writers and editors for their contributions to the digital magazine and website as well as our designer, who has been faithfully creating layouts and images for each issue free of charge, for the last year.
2. Collective ownership - The Mindful Word was founded as a collective where anyone who has an interest can get involved and use the forum as a way to engage themselves and the world. We feel that writing is a fantastic medium for personal and collective transformation that supports a deepening of one's own practice. To provide consistent, quality service to our readers while also moving forward with this vision of collaborative creativity, we’ve recently opened up ownership like a worker co-operative where contributors can take part in decisions and take ownership in their work.

3. Events & charitable initiatives - In addition to publishing stories about living a mindful, engaged life, The Mindful Word has hosted events where people can gain hands-on experience doing the kind of things we write about. We’d like to do more of that because we feel that reading about something is just the starting point and experiential learning is where the deepest lessons are learned. The same goes for charitable initiatives, which we’re looking to undertake. But before doing so, we need to get the website and magazine operating sustainably.

Our funding target is $8,000, which will fund operations for this transition year, providing the necessary upfront payment to writers, editors and the designer, after which point the upfront payments will no longer be necessary because we expect the contributors will be funded wholly by revenue sharing.
Contributions will also cover our design costs of $300 per issue, emailout costs of approximately $50 per issue and the rest going towards paying writers and editors. 
If we do meet our target, donors will get an additional perk: pick the themes for our four digital magazine issues next year, and suggest particular story ideas you'd like to see featured in those issues!
If we don't manage to raise $8,000, we won't take the money and run—we'll just have to lower the payments to our contributing writers and editors a bit. If we don’t meet the target, we also won’t be able to organize our issues according to specific themes. 
Since a great deal of political and economic unrest exists in the world, it's more important than ever to promote a culture of peace, tolerance and mindfulness. If you're able to help us disseminate our ideas as widely and with as much impact as possible, we will be grateful for your support. You'll be recognized for your contribution in our spring 2014 issue, on our website and our social media pages, if you so choose, and you'll receive a gift which you can choose from on the right.
If you like our vision, but you can't afford to make a donation at this time, we understand! Sign up for a free subscription anyways and keep in touch. And if you can, please help us promote our project by sharing our campaign on your social networks. If you're a writer or editor who would like to join us as a contributing member read this or if you’d like to just submit an article read our submission guidelines.
You can also join us on Facebook or Twitter using the links at the bottom of this page, and view our image gallery to see some of the picture quotes we have featured or will feature on Facebook in the near future.   
Keep smiling,
The Mindful Word

As a retired English businessman who has lived on three continents, I have a story to tell that will stir the imaginations of some people, and the memories of others.
The story is based on a local man in England who gets caught up in an intrigue involving US Airforce, CIA & British Intelligence, ex Polish Free Army, Russian agents, and mystery German super weapons.

The Nazi fugitive, one of Hitler's most important SS Officers has never been found or confirmed dead, and was never tried in absentia at Nuremberg. The story provides a plausible explanation as to his fate and final whereabouts.

<p></p></div>","Well, we did it. 
While we may not have reached our goal, the average contribution to this project was much higher than we anticipated, allowing us to lower our  shipping costs, and take advantage of unexpected quanitity discounts from our printer. Which really is just another way of saying we raised enough money to print the book!
Thanks to all of you who have encouraged us with your kind words, and your hard-earned dollars, especially during these tough economic times. 
We will be sending the manuscript away in a few days, and hope to have our books here before the end of August. After that, we'll throw a big party at the DS Art Studio, and you're all invited.
So stay tuned here, and follow along with us on the book's web site: www.PastMedicalHistoryBook.com , our Facebook page: www.facebook.com/PastMedicalHistory, and the author's art site:  www.DSArt.com/gallery/item/Past-Medical-History 
 
The Book

 
        Past Medical History is a compilation of short stories chronicling the early life of Dr. Don Stewart, who grew up with the singular goal of becoming a physician, then resigned the day he earned his medical license, to make a life and a living as an artist. It’s The Devil Wears Prada meets The House of God, with a character who sees his own career circling the drain, pronounces it DOA, and turfs himself to an art studio for treatment. It’s Patch Adams, with an attitude; The Things They Carried, dressed up in a white lab coat.
 
         This series of stories draws a clear picture of a doctor whose passion and creativity allowed him to recognize the pitfalls of his chosen profession, then compelled him to escape from the hospital, and take his life in a more creative, and far healthier direction.
 
The Author
          Don Stewart has a bachelor’s degree in Biology and Art from Birmingham-Southern College, and an MD from the University of Alabama School of Medicine. He also served a year-long surgical internship at the Mayo Clinic, where he published some of his first composite drawings, and won awards for poetry and short fiction.             (I know – he should have been studying surgery.)
         Dr. Stewart’s short stories have since been published in the Dead Mule School of Southern Literature, Pulse--voices from the heart of medicine, The Birmingham Arts Journal, The Placebo Journal, and The Journal of Irreproducible Results, where he is listed as honorary Art Editor. For four years he served as Contributing Editor to Informal Rounds, the newsletter of the University of Alabama Medical Alumni Association. He was also Senior Editor and chief clue writer for the award-winning board game Cleaver Endeavor.
         Aside from an earlier collection of humorous drawings released through the DS Art studio, this is his first book.
 
The Art
          Let’s be clear, this book is not about Don’s art. That is, it’s not a picture book. These stories tell about an artist, and his unusual path to a life of humor and creativity. 
         Don’s drawings are unusual, too. He works with a regular ballpoint pen, piling up groups of smaller pictures to create a larger composite design. (Curious? Visit www.DSArt.com.)
         Oh - and he always adds a twist of verbal humor, too, a touch that has caught the attention of a few notable wordsmiths: 
  
“The difference between your drawings and regular illustrations, I think, is like the difference between poetry and prose.”      - Will Shortz
                                                                          NPR PuzzleMaster
 “I salute you for finding your own way. Your work is truly making a difference at several levels.”     
- Larry Smith,  Adjunct Associate Professor of Economics,     University of Waterloo; TED lecturer.                                                              
 
“Don Stewart is a Warrior of Art!”    - Steven Pressfield 
                                                  Author, The Warrior Ethos
So glad you followed your dream and are sharing it with other dreamers!          - Charles Ghigna (Father Goose) 
 
Your Role
          Years ago, we asked our art customers to help fund the publication of a coffee table book, a collection of drawings from Don’s first twenty years in the studio. The experiment was a complete success – the book did so well that The Visual Humor of Don Stewart has since been re-released in a paperback edition. 
         Right now we need the same kind of support to produce Past Medical History. Without your help, these stories have little chance of being published at all.
          Your donation to our campaign will pay for printing and binding the book, plus shipping and handling costs to send books and other perks to you and the rest of our generous supporters.
 
What You Get
          How much fun is this: Anyone who donates $10 or more to this campaign gets their name printed in the book! (No profanity, please - no matter what your kid brother calls you. Even if you answer to it. Thanks!) 
         $25 gets you a book (with your name in it), and $50 gets you one signed by the author. Then there are fine art prints, original art, and other goodies listed in the “Perks” section. Take a look!
       Most of all, everyone who particpates gets to be part of an unusual story that has unfolded over a lifetime, one that speaks to the creative spirit in each of us.
 
Excerpt
Here’s a little sample of what we’re trying to get printed:
 
 
The man had nine tubes running into and out of his body the day he died. 
 
      Two IVs directed fluids and medications, drugs flowing into one arm to keep his blood pressure up, in the other to coax it back down, with antibiotics, anti-emetics, acid blockers, blood products and pain killers piggy-backed onto Y-shaped access ports, or pumped in measured doses through bliue computerized boxes clamped to metal IV poles.
      A third line penetrated deep into the man's chest, entering above his collar bone, coursing through the great thoracic vessels and the right-side chambers of his heart, its round balloon tip resting snugly in the terminal arteries of his lungs. Above, a thin yellow feeding tube emerged spaghetti-like from his nose, while down below a thick red rubber catheter drained the man's bladder into a bag hooked to the side of his bed. Another did what it could to channel the volumes of liquid feces that had plagued this patient for too many days, and took up far too much of the intensive care nurses' valuable time in sanitary maintenance, skin care and linen changes.
      Clear plastic tubes the size of small garden hoses exited either side of the patient's chest, each connected to a low-suction vacuum canister that functioned to keep his fragile lungs inflated - lungs that already popped like loose bubble-wrap from the air forced into them through a similar tube that traversed the length of his throat.
      This was the tube he had hoped to avoid. The one that just one week earlier he had made me promise - promise - not to let anyone put into him...

A Brief Intro
I am : Canadian (sorry) : BC born & raised : current Toronto resident : Literature degree-holder : self-taught designer : daily writer : first time novelist : purveyor of functuation {:fun punctuation:}
Over three years — mornings / weekends (re : whenever I’m not workin' for the man every night & day) — I’ve been plugging away at a Speculative Fiction. First draft complete (YIPPEE). Now, step two : prepping for publication.
2084 (the novel) is a : utopian vision : social satire : literary homage
[Follow my campaign for daily updates with synopsis / bios / excerpts.]
Me and my manuscript!

This campaign funds two very important things.
[One] While I’m confident my novel is publishable, any writing greatly benefits from (nay : requires) professional editing. I'm raising funds to participate in an editing program in which I’m paired with an established (re : published) Canadian author, who will provide detailed editing notes geared toward publication. This is a wonderful opportunity for me to improve my craft. Oh, and get published!
[Two] Illustrations! I want to commission graphic artist Kat Thorsen to illustrate my novel. I don’t know about you, but I really miss illustrations in adult fiction, and I’d like to see it make a comeback! Kat is a talented Canadian artist and her illustrations will complement my novel perfectly.
[Watch Kat draw!]
As a contributor, your donations will provide me with professional guidance that will help launch my career as an author, and allow me to turn a literary vision into a published reality!
Examples of Kat's portraits!


Financial Breakdown & Perks
What $15,000 Gets Me
[The following is in order of spending, if I don’t reach my goal.]
[$3000] Fee for The Humber School for Writers correspondence program in Creative Writing. This esteemed program pairs new writers / established writers, and boasts a high publication rate for participants!
[Here’s the link to the program. I'm applying to the May 2014 session.]
[$5000] Illustrations. Lots of illustrations! Artist Kat Thorsen will be commissioned to draw 25 detailed 18”x24” illustrations (china marker on newsprint) that will accompany the novel in publication. This will include character portraits and poignant scenes from each chapter. If I surpass my fundraising goal, I will commission more illustrations with the additional funds.
[Here's a link to the article that made me decide to go illustrated.]
[The Rest] Goes toward Indiegogo fees, production / postal fees for your perks, and future submission costs related to publication (printing, mailing manuscripts etc).
[If I reach / surpass my fundraising goal, I plan to give a donation to Wikipedia (50% from the surplus funds). Wikipedia has been a valuable source of research, and in fact is featured in my novel. I would like to donate to this amazing knowledge archive that relies solely on user donations.]
What You Get or, PERKS
[Small Donations] $10 / $25 donations will get you some sweet bookmarks or postcards, designed by me and featuring the artwork of Kat!
[Large Donations] $100 / $1000 donations will get you some seriously original collectibles, including personalized short stories written by me, or one of the six original portraits of the major characters, drawn by Kat! All potentially valuable by 2084 (. . .the year the novel take place. . .)
Pages and pages of notes!

The Impact
I believe in literature. It’s the reason I majored in it in university. It's been said that Literature is the study of human nature. A good writer can teach you about real world things, even in fiction : History / Biology / Psychology / Geography / Basket Weaving — no subject is exempt. I know my novel is literary / entertaining / funny / ominous / important. I know Canadians want to read challenging literature. I know that Sci Fi / Speculative genres are gaining ground in literary circles. I know that I can contribute to that literary future (pun absolutely intended). This campaign will impact my future success as a Canadian author.

Excited for the next steps!

Other Ways You Can Help
Financial strain is all too common these days (clearly) and I fully understand if you just can’t afford to contribute. Like you, I donate when I can, but you always have to keep yourself afloat before you help others.
If you’re someone who can’t contribute, your Social Prowess is just as valuable. Please post on all your social media platforms. Forward / Share / Tweet / Tumble / Pin or otherwise launch this campaign into the grand network we so endearingly call The Interwebs. The more people that see it, the more chance there is to achieve or surpass my goal of $15,000!

Letter Beasties are so much fun, kids won’t even realize they’re actually learning their ABCs.  Educators, parents and child development experts agree that these entertaining cartoon characters help children learn the alphabet faster, easier and with better memory retention.  Plus, everyone else just thinks they're cool.
  RON NOBLE is an Emmy Award® winning animation director who has been creating children's animation and illustrating kid's books for two decades.  He's overjoyed to share his new Letter Beasties cartoon creation through this campaign.  By regaining publishing control of his book, Ron can finally offer hardcover, glossy page, 7 x 10 inch, keepsake quality copies of the Letter Beasties at a great rate directly to you!
This amazing book is already written, illustrated and has received stellar reviews from parents, kids and critics.  All that's needed is funding from fans like you to get the new books printed so they can be available to everyone.  To see more about the book check out: www.LetterBeasties.com

 

By donating to the new printing of the Letter Beasties book you'll up your awesomeness, you'll get awesome PERKS and best of all you'll be helping to launch the entire Letter Beasties brand!  From animation to toys, games, plushes, bed sheets, you name it, it's all in the works and will all happen thanks to your support.
STRETCH GOAL  -- If we raise more than the $11K goal, the additional money will go toward funding a Letter Beasties Game App. If we hit $20,000 then every contributor to this campaign will get a huge discount off the Beasties Game App once it's made.
**Please share the campaign link, with your friends, family and anyone who would love to support the Letter Beasties!**
Be a part of the magic!....BE ALL YOU CAN BEASTIE!

The campaign will run for 30 days to raise the $11,000 needed to print the books.  Then it takes 2 months to have the books printed and shipped to us.   During those two months we will also produce the additional Perk items for you. Then Ron will sign all the ""signature"" items and we'll mail your full Beastie packages at the end of Sept. 
** If the $11K goal is reached earlier during the 30 day campaign, we will begin book production even sooner, which means you will receive your package possibly 1-3 weeks earlier than scheduled.  So the faster the goal is met, the faster the books will be in your hands.  Let's make it happen!

 
  Besides getting a big Beastie thanks from us and the satisfaction of knowing you're funding the next great ABC brand, we're offering super-cool extras to everyone who contributes!

<p>            My documents were destroyed and I couldn’t go to a city hall and ask for a birth certificate, because I wasn’t born here, I would have to go through Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS), which refused to assist me in regaining my papers back.  I had to go through ongoing obstacle course just to claim that my residency in the United States was legal. </p>
<p>            Where my traffickers weren’t your ordinary hoodlum from the Bronx in NY or some low life Pimp in the Urban areas.  These men and women were extremely powerful and very established.  What makes this story so prevalent is the fact that we refuse to face the truth that the people we put our faith into the justice system are the same people that controls the revolving door of the Human Market.  This book will take you step by step through the scenario of my experience as a vulnerable target to the being the ultimate threat of the ultimate truth.  This will also correlate how family dynamics of child sexual abuse or domestic violence plays a huge part of how a victim can be “chosen” to be enslaved into Domestic Trafficking.  Many of you may have or have not heard of the term, “Human Trafficking”, most of you may have thought of the term at one point or another, that it must’ve been some international issue that it doesn’t exist in our American soil, well the truth is about to shock you. </p>
<p>            Broken Silence is my story of courage, triumph and integrity of how I managed to escape the horrors of the daily abuse and torture of Human Exploitation, recant over 10 years later to seek peace and serenity of the years that were robbed from me.  Allow me to take you on a journey into my world, most may shock you and may even disgust you, but at least you will know the truth.  I hope you will enjoy reading this book as I have enjoyed sharing it with you.</p></div>","Broken Silence is my personal narration of my life; it’s compelling yet its gut wrenching at most.  It’s my way to voice what I have experienced as a survivor of many things that most are not able to speak of.  It is my personal duty to share what I overcame and how I was able to gain back my life and shift the gears of empowerment to benefit not only myself but to many other victims out there.  This is definitely a memoir of my harrowing experience in child hood trauma of sexual abuse and my life as a sex-slave in the trafficking scenario here in the United States.  You may have read about me in articles and other places, but if you want to know the truth everything about my life then look no further.  In the articles you may have read about me, certain details were changed due to editorial standards and also because I was not ready to tell the whole story in full.  Now I have the chance to bring my voice to life.  Broken Silence is not your ordinary survival story of family abuse, but it goes beyond the trust realm of our society involving corruption from certain officials and opens a new door of realization of our economy that I was forced to be involved in.  This is my detailed story of how I became a Naturalized Citizen in the United States, shaking the very hands of President Ronald Regan in 1984-1985 and nearly ten years later I had fallen victim into enslavement through the people who are responsible to keep American citizens safe from harm.

I was going to fundraise by asking my family and their friends to chip in a little bit of money so I could fly to Ohio to get out the vote for Barack Obama in the days leading up the election. I hoped I could raise enough to pay for a round trip air ticket for myself, knowing that Obama supporters in the area were willing to let me sleep on their couch while I was out there. Instead of asking people to give money to the campaign, I asked people to give money to me, so I could turn those donations into tangible action, putting it towards helping me get people to the polls and not towards the attack ads arms race.</p>
<p><br/>In the end, thanks to the magic of email forwarding, I got little checks from dozens of people (including people I had never heard of, frankly), and actually raised enough to buy tickets not only for myself, but also for my former college roommates to join me in Ohio. Together we knocked on hundreds of doors for the Obama campaign, raising awareness and excitement, and helping people get the facts about their polling place, its hours of operations, and how they could get there to do their civic duty. We even combated the false rumors flying around in some low income areas about voting being delayed until Wednesday - a tactic intended to disenfranchise certain types of voters (not sure exactly where the rumor was coming from, I should say).<br/><br/>I know a lot of you don't have the same level of enthusiasm this year as you did in 2008, but this election remains vitally important. While I don't think Romney is as poor of a candidate as McCain (and Bush, obviously), he is still not what this country needs in my view. Given his statements and his somewhat extreme VP selection, it sounds like his likely social and economic policies will do nothing to correct what I believe is a shocking and unfair growth in income inequality in the country - in fact, his policies will likely exacerbate this problem. Internationally, he has also shown himself to be disappointing on his recent foreign excursion. I don't think he's a fool, or an incompetent person, or a tax evader, but he is most certainly not the man who belongs in the White House.<br/><br/>So I am emailing you to ask you to consider making a small contribution - whatever you are willing and able to spare - to help me fund another trip to a key swing state in early November, for myself and as many of my friends as I can convince to join me.</p>

<p><em>Who am I?: So here's the full spiel - apologies in advance for too much information: I went to Princeton University and graduated in 2006. I was politically active there, and spent the summer of 2004 serving as the Canvass Director for the DNC office for the John Kerry campaign in Santa Barbara, CA. I managed a staff of about 30 canvassers and grassroots organizers involved with get-out-the-vote and fundraising campaigns there. After Princeton, I worked for a year in Kenya for the International Rescue Committee, a development organization working with refugees, before starting a Masters program in Public Policy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. I graduated from that program in 2009, but stayed on at Harvard as a PhD student in the Public Policy PhD program, where I currently study behavioral economics, decision making, and public sector economics. I have also spent time consulting for the World Bank and UNICEF during his time as a PhD student. Besides all that, I love sports, music, movies, and my dog Humphrey (who is also a Bark Obama fan... sorry).</em></p></div>","In 2008, I emailed my family with a plan.

After Princeton, I worked for a year in Kenya for the International Rescue Committee, a development organization working with refugees, before starting a Masters program in Public Policy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. I graduated from that program in 2009, but stayed on at Harvard as a PhD student in the Public Policy PhD program, where I currently study behavioral economics, decision making, and public sector economics. I have also spent time consulting for the World Bank and UNICEF during his time as a PhD student. Besides all that, I love sports, music, movies, and my dog Humphrey (who is also a Bark Obama fan... sorry).",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><br/><font size=""3""><br/></font><font size=""3"">Picture This!</font><br/><br/>Around the world people are starting to question authority on a scale never before seen. The Occupy movement, the Tea Party, climate skeptics, 911 Truth Movement the list goes on. They all have something in common, our system is stretched to breaking point, financially, spiritually, socially and politically and something has to change, has to give. Philosophy has often provided ideas for change throughout history and every major political and spiritual movement has had some kind of philosophical counterpart.<br/><br/>Authority is being challenged within academic Philosophy as well, as it is in many other academic fields. The Academy is stuck in outdated ideas and ways of doing things. Change is happening faster than the usual university system can comprehend. New ways for philosophical ideas to be produced and spread are required, and IndieGoGo is surely one of those.<br/><br/>My name is Justin Holme. I studied philosophy at Cambridge University in the UK, at St. Edmund’s Colledge, and graduated with an MA. It was great. The environment was great, the teaching was outstanding, the resources we had were first class in every way. There was one thing missing though and that was fire. A fire for the truth, for creativity and therefore ultimately for the type philosophy I wanted to do.<br/><br/>The academic brand of philosophy seemed to be less concerned with truth and new ideas than it was with choosing a side, often in what seemed a meaningless or irrelevant debate, and then sticking to it doggedly. In this way a young philosopher could join one ‘team’ or another within a particular philosophical battle and expect support at least from one side. Those who wanted to just follow truth where it leads were either attacked by both sides or even worse ignored!<br/><br/>Worst of all if someone stood up and claimed that the whole ‘battlefield’ being fought over was itself irrelevant, that it was a philosophical desert leading to nowhere, they would be strongly attacked by all concerned. Unfortunately this is the reality of much of academic philosophy today and only outside of it can anything much be changed to make it more relevant and more useful. At least this is my conclusion.<br/><br/>However the institutions for this new approach to philosophy are limited. Most journals and publishers are also very tied up in what amounts to another moribund academic institution like so many others many of us know all too well I’m sure. There are a few journals which will publish work from new philosophers, and I have had around ten small and large pieces published in Philosophy Now, the largest circulation philosophy magazine, including one of the essays for this book. I have also had work published by New Humanist, also to be included in the book, and many articles are under consideration at this time. Also the text of two well received talks I gave to the ‘Immoral Sciences Club’, a philosophy students association at Cambridge, are included. Two pieces have been specially written to help to introduce the book and the subject to the reader. However there are really only very limited outlets for philosophy aimed at the interested public.<br/><br/>Magazine articles I thought would be a way forward for someone outside the philosophical establishment to gradually get their work and ideas known and perhaps eventually have enough material for a book. After quite a few years and sending out many articles, and having many of my best ideas published without any payment, I started to think books are the way to go. There is only so long that someone can do the work they love and feel they ‘should’ do without some reward other than the work itself, and perhaps making some contribution to the discussions. Also a book can have a lot more impact if it gets picked up by a few influential critics or even just through word of mouth.<br/><br/>This is where IndieGoGo and you come in. Convincing a publisher that there is a market for work outside the philosophical mainstream, often even critical of it, is not easy to say the least. They know full well that someone who is perhaps going to try to undermine whole areas of ongoing philosophical wrangling is not going to be popular, and then nor are they.

What had seemed like some kind of eternal paradox has been shown to be only a myth, and it is so simple. 'What came first the chicken or the egg?' has been asked over a pint of beer, or of a curious child, millions of times over the centuries. 'Chicken ...' they might answer, '...because you need a chicken to lay an egg'. Ahha but where did the chicken come from. Well now the answer is found and no one can be asked again. The egg came first.<br/><br/><br/>It is so simple, any evolutionary biologist will tell you that eggs evolved long, long before chickens were even dreamt of. For instance turtles, which have been around for 100s of millions of years longer than chickens, also use eggs in their reproductive cycle.<br/> <br/><br/>Ahhha you say, Mr. Clever Philosopher, you have misunderstood the question entirely. It is not just any egg that has to be proven the former, it is a chicken egg only that counts. The question should really state 'What came first the chicken or the chicken egg?'.<br/><br/> <br/>Right let us really define the question. With chicken we mean the common farmyard animal, pieces of which add substance to our Friday night Vindaloo curries, and with 'egg' we mean the egg that is laid by the female of that species? Then I say the answer is chicken. The chicken came first.<br/> <br/><br/>Oh brilliant you may say. Anyone could answer this question with two guesses, there are after all only two answers.<br/> <br/><br/>Ahha I would say but this is a different and altogether better defined question. Also some might say that chickens and eggs popped into existence simultaneously, if they did not believe in evolution by natural selection, but in the biblical account of creation, taken literally.<br/> <br/><br/>You might well say; No, I believe in evolution, or at least something like the theory, and before you get really obscure I believe in linear time. In other words things that happened in the past, as we normally refer to it, happen 'before' things that happen in the present or in the future.<br/> <br/><br/>OK, I say, then let me take you back to the past to prove my claim that the chicken must have come first. Way, way back we pass through the mists of time to a field long ago before the time of chickens.<br/><br/><br/>Now you're getting facetious...<br/> <br/><br/>In fact just before chickens evolved. Down below we see on the plain two animals that look a bit like chickens but they are in fact their immediate ancestors in the evolutionary chain. We will call them Chickenosauruses.<br/> <br/><br/>Couldn't you be bothered even to do a little bit of research?<br/> <br/><br/>Just after having something to eat, and before settling down for the night, they decide to try to create another little Chickenosaurus.<br/> <br/><br/>Oh my, this is getting heated!<br/> <br/><br/>But something is wrong ... as the sperm and egg meet there is a mistake that will be replicated in every cell. It will be no Chickenosaurus that matures within the Chickenosaurus-egg but a horrible mutant.<br/> <br/><br/>A chicken!?<br/> <br/><br/>Yes, you got it, but from a Chickenosaurus-egg. In fact she is a hen who will go on to lay a chicken egg when she is mature.<br/><br/> <br/>Maybe. Anyway can we go back to the discussion on linear time, there really is no proof for it you know!?<br/><br/><font size=""3"">Brain in a Box</font><br/><br/>Philosophers have debated the possibility that the world is an illusion, ever since there were thinkers that can be called the name. The French philosopher René Descartes, of ‘I think therefore I am’ fame, was one of the first to describe the problem clearly. He postulated that there might be an evil demon that controlled all his sensory inputs and could therefore delude him about everything, except maybe himself. Today’s philosophers are more likely to talk in scientific terms, of a mad scientist controlling a virtual-reality machine that we are plugged into. The problem is how can we know this is not the case?<br/> <br/><br/>If it is the case that the universe is an independent reality, or a common-sense reality as we normally think about it, how could we tell this apart from an extremely well generated simulation? There might even be quite severe shortcomings of the virtual reality, but we would be so accustomed to them that we would be unlikely to see them as such. With no other ‘true’ reality to compare this one with, it would seem impossible to notice such shortcomings. All we can really know for sure is that something exists, and that something I call ‘me’.<br/> <br/><br/>So in the universe we are thinking about there is definitely me and someone, or something else, which is generating what I perceive as reality. Rather than labelling that something as a ‘mad scientist’ or ‘evil demon’ I will use a more neutral word, the Generator. I think the Generator also deserves the use of capitals as in this universe It would be the equivalent of God. It has, presumably, created this simulated reality, It controls it to a very fine degree and I am essentially totally in Its power. Also why should I assume that It is evil or mad, certainly there seem to be many bad and even evil things in this reality but there are many good and beautiful aspects too.<br/> <br/><br/>From my own point of view the Generator appears to have treated me quite well and fairly, maybe there is even a hint of love there. If It was evil or mad surely my life would have been much different, not something that seems to have been leading me to greater self-awareness and empowerment but something more like the traditional view of hell, or a living insanity. No, I see a world that generally seems to make rational sense, in which I can see most of my misfortunes have been created by my own actions, or inactions, and where I have experienced much pleasure and joy.<br/> <br/><br/>So it seems unfair to label the Generator as evil, at least not yet, plus I don’t really want to believe that the being who has total control of my experience of the world, and who seems to be my only companion, is evil or mad. On the other side it seems difficult to really believe It is doing this all for my benefit, as I have suffered some injustices, accidents and other things that would not seem necessarily to be for my benefit.<br/><br/><br/>Of course all of this is a kind of binary universe, the Generator and I. Maybe my reality is controlled by hundreds of other beings, millions or none. Perhaps the Generator and myself are the same being. This would seem to be more likely as it does not require that I postulate this incredible other being. The only thing I really know exists is me, so maybe I generate reality, and hide this fact from myself. Perhaps I am trapped within my own fantasy and out there, if I could only let it go, is a true reality waiting, or perhaps not.<br/><br/><br/>If I am indeed all that exists then maybe I have been forced to create a reality to escape crushing loneliness, isolation and boredom. One can imagine a consciousness all alone in the void and darkness wanting to do just that, assuming It didn’t have the means to create a ‘real’ reality, which would surely be preferable. In fact I may have just started seeing swirls of light in the darkness, indistinct shapes and started ‘hearing’ noises or voices, and that was just the beginning of everything I now perceive as existing.<br/> <br/><br/>If all this was true then in fact my current mental state may be due to a long process of fantasy creation, where I have ended up with a very coherent virtual reality which basically does work. I am rarely bored, often feel that I am with others, have projects that interest me, and it even feels like I am becoming somehow better. Perfect, the illusion is so strong that I can even write an article on this fact without it feeling at all illusory, so what’s the problem?<br/><br/> <br/>Well with the single-being universe I can’t see a problem. I am probably doing the best I can to cope and will probably continue to do so (not only that, but I already capitalise ‘I’ so that is sorted out). After all what would be the choice; darkness, loneliness and boredom? I think fantasy is a much better alternative.<br/><br/> <br/>On the other hand the binary universe looks even better, just the benefit of not being completely alone makes up for ambiguities or imperfections in the Generator. Also it explains how such an apparently puny being, such as I appear to myself to be when I examine my own thought processes, manages to generate such an incredible place. After all can it be that the same creature that, on the one hand, can’t work out how to use some functions on his mobile-phone, is capable of generating all of reality, so the binary-universe looks more likely again.<br/> <br/><br/>However there exists the possibility that the binary universe could be worse than the ‘I’ universe. Maybe the Generator has just been lulling me into a false sense of security, so that when the rug is finally pulled from under my feet, the fall will be so much more sadistically satisfying. In other words the fact that the universe seems reasonably benign and predictable could be just temporary.<br/> <br/><br/>Maybe this dramatic change in reality has happened many, many times in the past and the Generator has arranged for me to forget this terrible fact. Perhaps It uses the illusion of birth and early childhood, which does seem a bit unreal, fuzzy and a long time ago, to hide the past. There does however seem to be a more likely scenario for the binary universe, and one that is much more appealing anyway.<br/> <br/><br/>Maybe the Generator was at one time the only being, as in the ‘I’ universe, but instead of falling into fantasy, or after long periods of fantasy that It eventually tired of or escaped, It decided to try creating a genuine other being. I am Its first prototype companion, which would explain some of the mistakes that I see as injustices and suffering. Obviously the suffering of others is unreal and therefore is only there as instruction, or support for myself, and tells me nothing about the goodness or otherwise of the Generator. However what if others are not illusions purely for my benefit?<br/><br/> <br/>Perhaps the Generator, realising that it had the capacity to create other beings decided that It better create more than one. It could be the case that in the past It started with one, or just a few beings, and this did not really work out well. These prototypes were able to realise they were alone, or very few, in the universe and suffered because of this. On the other hand they may not have been entirely what the Generator wanted or, after creating them, It had a grander vision. It saw the possibility of creating a whole other genuine and rational reality into which would spring consciousness largely from itself. Just a ‘little’ Big Bang, of exactly the correct type, and everything would lead from that.<br/> <br/><br/>Not only would this have the advantage of creating a whole range and variety of others but they would have a certain independence from the Generator. Within this separate reality they could interact with each other and would not have to face the same problems of loneliness and boredom, or general lack of anything, that the Generator Itself had suffered. Given time these beings would develop and grow, and many, if not all, would mature to the point where they would be genuine companions to the Generator. This would be perhaps what could be called the Common Sense Universe, which largely agrees with how we normally think of it.<br/><br/> <br/>All these scenarios have one thing in common; it is better to believe in a good Generator whichever universe is in fact true. If the ‘I’ universe is the case, then the belief in a separate Generator, would increase the illusion of companionship and security, which would help the fantasy. In the binary-universe I, being the only subject of every whim of the Generator, had better believe that It has my interests somewhat at heart. The alternative is really not worthy of consideration, if taken seriously.<br/><br/> Continued in the book.<br/></div>","Picture This!Around the world people are starting to question authority on a scale never before seen. The Occupy movement, the Tea Party, climate skeptics, 911 Truth Movement the list goes on. They all have something in common, our system is stretched to breaking point, financially, spiritually, socially and politically and something has to change, has to give. Philosophy has often provided ideas for change throughout history and every major political and spiritual movement has had some kind of philosophical counterpart.Authority is being challenged within academic Philosophy as well, as it is in many other academic fields. The Academy is stuck in outdated ideas and ways of doing things. Change is happening faster than the usual university system can comprehend. New ways for philosophical ideas to be produced and spread are required, and IndieGoGo is surely one of those.My name is Justin Holme. I studied philosophy at Cambridge University in the UK, at St. Edmund’s Colledge, and graduated with an MA. It was great. The environment was great, the teaching was outstanding, the resources we had were first class in every way. There was one thing missing though and that was fire. A fire for the truth, for creativity and therefore ultimately for the type philosophy I wanted to do.The academic brand of philosophy seemed to be less concerned with truth and new ideas than it was with choosing a side, often in what seemed a meaningless or irrelevant debate, and then sticking to it doggedly. In this way a young philosopher could join one ‘team’ or another within a particular philosophical battle and expect support at least from one side. Those who wanted to just follow truth where it leads were either attacked by both sides or even worse ignored!Worst of all if someone stood up and claimed that the whole ‘battlefield’ being fought over was itself irrelevant, that it was a philosophical desert leading to nowhere, they would be strongly attacked by all concerned. Unfortunately this is the reality of much of academic philosophy today and only outside of it can anything much be changed to make it more relevant and more useful. At least this is my conclusion.However the institutions for this new approach to philosophy are limited. Most journals and publishers are also very tied up in what amounts to another moribund academic institution like so many others many of us know all too well I’m sure. There are a few journals which will publish work from new philosophers, and I have had around ten small and large pieces published in Philosophy Now, the largest circulation philosophy magazine, including one of the essays for this book. I have also had work published by New Humanist, also to be included in the book, and many articles are under consideration at this time. Also the text of two well received talks I gave to the ‘Immoral Sciences Club’, a philosophy students association at Cambridge, are included. Two pieces have been specially written to help to introduce the book and the subject to the reader. However there are really only very limited outlets for philosophy aimed at the interested public.Magazine articles I thought would be a way forward for someone outside the philosophical establishment to gradually get their work and ideas known and perhaps eventually have enough material for a book. After quite a few years and sending out many articles, and having many of my best ideas published without any payment, I started to think books are the way to go. There is only so long that someone can do the work they love and feel they ‘should’ do without some reward other than the work itself, and perhaps making some contribution to the discussions. Also a book can have a lot more impact if it gets picked up by a few influential critics or even just through word of mouth.This is where IndieGoGo and you come in.
