<p><i>So what do we have so far?</i></p>
<p>Nativo is still in its beginning stages of being created. While the website is launched and the BETA is under development, we haven't been able to create the actual gamified platform on which our students can learn. We have been able to outline our program: an online programming course in which you can create your own avatar that grows alongside your technological knowledge to help you keep track of your own progress and work through coding challenges. We've created the characters, animations, and curricula necessary for Nativo too. However, putting this all together is the most difficult and costly part of the entire process, and <i>that's where you come in</i>. </p>
<p>The ultimate goal of this project is to have animated programming courses available in four languages - <i style=""font-weight: bold;"">English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese</i>. We want all our students to have the same learning experience and come out of the course feeling comfortable enough to code, <i>regardless of the challenge</i>. The cost of creating this gamified experience for all our students in one language, let alone four, is quickly adding up. In order to expand the reach of technology education across the globe, we need your help and that of the entire international community.</p>

I am helping Boston's On the Rise to raise funds to help furnish ""Miss J's"" new apartment.  Miss J has recently begun to overcome the enormity of homelessness.  She has worked with On the Rise's day program to prepare her for a life and an apartment.  I hope that you, my trusted friends and family, will consider donating a few (or many) dollars to help this woman with the basic needs of an apartment.  Miss J is working hard to pay her bills, but to move in, she needs every basic we may take for granted.  I am not looking for used items here, as it is important for Miss J to feel ownership of her new items, rather than caretaking for someone else's goods.  
  What she needs 
 Remember moving into your college dorm, and starting with a blank slate?  Use that as your imagination jumping off point.  Here is a list of the few items she truly needs, and one item she wishes for and their approximate prices.  The money will be pooled here, and I will purchase the items according to her wishes and deliver them to her new home:  Cooking pot/pan set $125

Bakeware $75

Cooking utensils $75

Toaster $55

Coffee Maker $50

4 place silverware $75

2 bed pillows $25

Alarm clock $15

1 Queen comforter $75

1 Queen sheet set $35

that it tells, has helped to unite people, to forgive others and forgive

Without a
doubt, cinema is an artistic expression of social changes, which helps to tear
down ideological barriers, which gives light to individually unique human
beings from all corners of the globe, with their hopes and struggles, and which
directly or indirectly touches the emotional core of the public.With the assistance of the cinematic arts, the
festival of LGBT cinema, El Lugar Sin Límites, presents new alternatives of entertainment
and information. It opens space for debate and reflection where different
viewpoints are expressed about rights and self-determination. In our 13 years,
we have served as witnesses to the way in which cinema, through the stories
that it tells, has helped to unite people, to forgive others and forgive
ourselves, to demand rights, to inspire new challenges to tear down the
barriers that separate society; ultimately, creating a space without limits
where each person can be whoever he or she desires, while always respecting
each other.Aware of the
fact that culture occupies a strategic position in the search for solutions to
social problems, the festival appears at the end of the year 2002, in
commemoration of November 27th, 1997, the date on which the
Constitutional Court of Ecuador declared unconstitutional Article 516 of the
Penal Code, in which homosexuality was considered a crime. This date marked an
end to constant human rights violations and the persecution of LGBT
Ecuadorians.The festival simultaneously
takes place in five Ecuadorian cities, counting on a diverse acceptance of

short films), that tell life stories with a social message. However, the
festival is not merely a projection of movies. Rather, it is one of the most

</div></div>","Imagine a toy that helps children to learn how to think positively and meditate at an early age!  Help the next generation focus on positive things, and provide them with tools to reduce stress and maintain their wellbeing!""I think this is a wonderful idea for young, fresh minds. The sooner a young child learns to be positive the brighter the future looks. Meditation is something I feel everyone should experience and the thought of introducing this to a young child is absolutely wonderful. Thank you for thinking of this loving idea."" - Kathy Lockyer
Inspiration


The inspiration for the idea of Abey the Dolphin came on Family Day this year when I received a Facebook message from Hermine Zossougbo, a mother of two from South Africa.  
Hermine wrote, ""Like you, I want nothing more than to enlighten.  On my journey, I came to learn the value of self love, which is the value I want to share I have an idea of making a smart electronic doll for girls to teach and help know that love start with oneself I see.""Hermine had already spent her savings working with a company to develop the idea, but she was not happy with what they had come up with.   Hermine asked me to help her.  From that spark, the concept of Abraham Bear (now Abey the Dolphin) evolved.    



About Me


My name is Janine Newhook.  I worked as an Engineer for 12 years developing opto-mechanical devices, medical robotics, and space robotics.  I am also an Artist, Graphic Designer, Energy Worker, and Blogger.  
I am now a Mother of two wonderful boys and I have seen the impact of positive thinking on my children.  I would like to make a difference by helping to teach other children how to be positive and meditate with an interactive, educational toy.

Product
Abey the Dolphin is a cuddly, super soft toy concept with push button features, on the fins, tail, and tummy, which connects to a computer to be personalized with the child’s likes, and preferences.  Abey the Dolphin is intended for 3 year olds and up.  
          




Features include:






Guided meditations to quiet the mind and relax, followed by five minutes of music.  Meditations include deep breathing, relaxing body parts from head to toes, breathing in ""calm"" and out ""peace"", flying over the Earth, floating on a calm river...


Happy music options (dance party!), or, bed-time music options


Questions to encourage positive thinking 


The heart lights up and flickers like water when pressed







What is Needed
At this time, the intent is to raise some initial funds to perform a prior art search and explore options including licensing to a corporation, sourcing potential manufacturers, and possibly working with partners/investors.  Further, I plan to contact toy manufacturers to estimate the development cost of Abraham Bear to determine how much investment is required.  

There has already been some interest from investors.  Once I have a better understanding of the costs and interested parties, I will put together an investors information package.   Please contact me if you would like an investors information package when it is available.  

If I meet my crowd funding goal, and Abey the Dolphin becomes a product, any excess funds contributed over the goal will be used to donate Abraham Bears to children in need.
If this is a toy you would purchase for your child or grandchild, and you feel inspired by my vision, your support would be greatly appreciated!

The Impact

 Meditation and positivity has been shown in numerous studies to help people, including children, to significantly improve their well being, self esteem, and ability to cope with stress.

""Studies show that in the minutes right after meditating, we experience feelings of calm and contentment, as well as heightened awareness and empathy. And, research even shows that regular meditation can permanently rewire the brain to raise levels of happiness.""

http://www.slideshare.net/LionSteps/presentations
We have learned a lot during our 25 years´ career and we want to share this experience with all entrepreneurs. This will be done via hard-cover books and e-books. And the Audits and the Tools can be uploaded from our website in September 2015. 
Our Proft Lectures are very short and colourful, and our Profit Tools are unique and Easy-to-Use. We believe that they will help any entrepreneur. 
You will find practical tools for understanding and implementing issues as:

Active sales procedure
Most profitable customers
Fixed costs and variable costs
Empowering leadership style
Improving efficiency
Lean production 
etc.

We also suggest, that You donate Profit Tools -Books to libraries, so students can read these all over the world. 


What We Need and What You Get
 We are collecting 30.000  dollars - or more - for this first book. The money is needed for:
 Assistant´s salary
Translation and proofreading

Printing
 Delivery
 Our perks are books for yourself or donated books to libraries all over the world.
You can donate up to 1000 books, a 30.000 dollar perk!


  The Impact Normal business books are too long and boring and they provide no easy tools for entrepreneurs.  The students don´t have practical textbooks. 
The impact of our Profit Lectures and Profit Tools will be remarkable in any company. We have hundreds of testimonies from entrepreneurs - from 10 countries. 
Students learn the Best Profit Tools much easier, faster and practical than before, when they get these books from libraries.

<h4>What is the problem you have faced ?</h4>
<p>“As an architect in Paris, I have always been looking for ways to improve collaboration and productivity.</p>
<p>But in the company where I had the opportunity to work, I was feeling that people were losing too much time doing what others had already done, without any collaborative tool to share our experience on the projects we were working on.</p>
<p><img alt=""The architect’s tools"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ucarecdn.com/c5f17449-b688-454a-98af-a5b7ca64a497/-/resize/600/"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h4>Which elements you would have liked to share ?</h4>
<p>""Architects often get inspirations from a lot of projects, whether they have been designed by themselves or by other architects, or even from the traditional building culture.</p>
<p>That does not mean they are copying other architecture, but generally we prefer a starter to design faster, to communicate more easily with our team and the client, and to facilitate the imagination.</p>
<p>Indeed a realisation with stunning photos is much more convincing than a sketch !”</p>

<h4>Do you know good example of successful collaboration in other domains ?</h4>
<p>“I am also the founder of <a href=""http://www.archiref.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Archiref, a collaborative platform for architects</a>, that helps architecture professionals to find and share visual inspirations for their projects.</p>
<p>When developing Archiref and Bricks, I have used lots of awesome open source software bricks, that worldwide developers have built thanks to online collaboration.</p>
<p>Developers often work on open source projects for their pleasure and share them on platforms like <a href=""http://www.github.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">github</a>. But they are also rewarded by a sincere recognition from the community.</p>
<p>I often wondered why architects and creative professionals are less familiar with collaboration than developers.</p>

<h4>So what is your proposal to improve collaboration among architects?</h4>

<p>Bricks is a web app to collect, organize and reuse visual elements of projects and collaborate with your team and the community.</p>
<p>Bricks allow you to identify reusable elements of projects on images you can pick everywhere on the web, from your hard drive, from online services like google drive or from your own projects…</p>
<h3>What is a Brick?</h3>

<p>A brick is a reusable element of a project like a stair, a roof type, a facade…</p>
<p>Anything you can split to reuse in a future project. Practically a brick is an annotated image of the element you want to reuse. The image is where the inspiration starts, but you can put on a brick all the information you need to be able to reuse this element and describe how to do it.</p>
<p>On a brick :</p>
<ul>
<li>you can discuss with your team</li>
<li>attach related files like 3D model, pdf catalogues</li>
<li>see in which project it has been used</li>

You can really help us!</p>
<h3>Collect inspirations from everywhere</h3>
<p>Bricks allows you to collect inspirations images easily :</p>
<ul>
<li>from your hard drive</li>
<li>from the web page </li>
<li>from web services like Facebook, Instagram, Google Drive, Dropbox…</li>

<p>Thanks to your help, we want to build an <strong>integrated image library</strong>, that will allow you to search in one place in lots of stunning architecture sources, like architecture platforms (architizer, archilovers, archiref, dezeen…), tumblr blogs, flickr groups, pinterest…</p>
<p>This will allow you to find inspirations more rapidly and add them in a click to your bricks online library.</p>
<p>Which sources you would like us to integrate in this library ? 
We are open to your suggestions ! Use the comment section to give us your opinion.</p>
<h3>Organize your inspirations efficiently</h3>
<p>The problem with inspiration, is not to have some, there are plenty of it ! Too much actually to look at all. But how to organize them to find them later, in a truly efficient way ?</p>
<p>The problem with Pinterest for example, is that for architects and creative professionals like us, it doesn’t have the project level ! I can collect stairs all the day, but which stair I would like to use in which project, this is important ! Isn’t it ?</p>
<p><img alt=""Bricks organisation"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ucarecdn.com/c549f997-eb8f-4b43-b1db-326014f01d4c/-/resize/600/"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In Bricks, you can work with your inspirations on a project per project basis.</p>
<p>In a project, you can organize your images on layers. Layers can help you to group all the elements you need to work on during the project life, for example stairs, roofs…</p>
<p><img alt=""Layers in Bricks"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ucarecdn.com/1c9da4b4-c83b-4dec-8c21-60bfc86082d1/-/resize/300/"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Layers are global, so you will find them in your shared library. And you will be able to get inspired from others projects developed by your team.</p>
<p>You can even define bricks relationships, that is for example a step in a stair, or a window in a facade. To do that, you have just to select the sub-element or sub-brick you want to get directly on the image. The relationship is saved, so you can navigate in the projects elements from one brick to another.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can define sub element inside an image and we store bricks relationship to be able to display you the hierarchy of elements</p>

<p>While working on your project, you are building a collaborative bricks library you can share easily with who you want.</p>
<p>Bricks helps you to design faster, to concentrate on the originality of your project, and to contribute to a shared knowledge base on which to start new projects.</p>
<p>At the same time when you are working on a specific project, you will also have access to a personal images library, where you can find all the images you have used in your projects and filter them by tags, usage…</p>
<p>This allows you to have a bird’s eye view of the work of all your team and reuse past inspirations in new projects.</p>
<p>You can set your projects sharing the same way as in google drive :</p>

<li>private</li>
<li>shared to a specific group of people</li>

<h3>What we will do thanks to your support</h3>
<p>You could  help us greatly, explaining us your specific needs. We need to understand how you are currently organizing your inspirations for your architecture and creatives work.</p>
<p>To develop Bricks more rapidly we need at least 10 000 US$ to give us the opportunity to work full time on the project for 2-3 months and have some exterior helps of web developers.</p>
<p>We want to improve the online version with the following awesome features :</p>
<ul>

Bricks is an online app to reuse easily visual bricks of architecture projects & collaborate with your team and the community.

Hi everybody!
We are Sébastien and Alexis, the founders of Bricks.
We are based in Paris, France, and we want to revolutionize the way we design architecture projects! Thanks to your help we can drive architecture practice collaborative, following the path of web developers and many other professionals!

Sébastien Lucas
  
Alexis Lemoine Iribarne
  

Bricks is a web app for architects to collect & organize your visual inspirations easily and collaborate with other architects.
With bricks you can share and reuse elements of projects.
Bricks allows you :

to design faster starting from a project brick
concentrate on the originality of your project
share your experience with the community


The origin of the project
Sébastien Lucas talksabout the origin of the project

What is the problem you have faced ?
“As an architect in Paris, I have always been looking for ways to improve collaboration and productivity.
But in the company where I had the opportunity to work, I was feeling that people were losing too much time doing what others had already done, without any collaborative tool to share our experience on the projects we were working on.

Which elements you would have liked to share ?
""Architects often get inspirations from a lot of projects, whether they have been designed by themselves or by other architects, or even from the traditional building culture.
That does not mean they are copying other architecture, but generally we prefer a starter to design faster, to communicate more easily with our team and the client, and to facilitate the imagination.
Indeed a realisation with stunning photos is much more convincing than a sketch !”

The architect office of Norman Foster
  

Do you know good example of successful collaboration in other domains ?
“I am also the founder of Archiref, a collaborative platform for architects, that helps architecture professionals to find and share visual inspirations for their projects.
When developing Archiref and Bricks, I have used lots of awesome open source software bricks, that worldwide developers have built thanks to online collaboration.
Developers often work on open source projects for their pleasure and share them on platforms like github. But they are also rewarded by a sincere recognition from the community.
I often wondered why architects and creative professionals are less familiar with collaboration than developers.
I felt that it was not a fatality and could be changed if new apps or platforms allowed collaborative design to become a reality.”

Github is the collaborative platform of worldwide developers
  

So what is your proposal to improve collaboration among architects?
“So I have imagined Bricks, a web app that allows you to share design ideas and inspirations easily and could play an equivalent role for architects than github is currently playing for developers.”
Bricks is designed to make it easy for you to organize and share your visual inspirations and design new projects starting from reusable Bricks of project shared by the community!“
What is Bricks for?

Bricks is a web app to collect, organize and reuse visual elements of projects and collaborate with your team and the community.
Bricks allow you to identify reusable elements of projects on images you can pick everywhere on the web, from your hard drive, from online services like google drive or from your own projects…
What is a Brick?

A brick is a reusable element of a project like a stair, a roof type, a facade…
Anything you can split to reuse in a future project. Practically a brick is an annotated image of the element you want to reuse. The image is where the inspiration starts, but you can put on a brick all the information you need to be able to reuse this element and describe how to do it.
On a brick :

you can discuss with your team
attach related files like 3D model, pdf catalogues
see in which project it has been used
see who favorited it or has used it on a project 
identify which products the project uses

If you create an account and connect to Bricks, you would see the current screen when you click on a brick

A list of bricks
  
A single brick
  

This is the simple Brick as we have set up the most important elements first, so that you can use Bricks as soon as possible
You can then fill :

a title 
an image 
a comment feed (using DISQUS service)
a description

We plan to enhance what a brick is, thanks to the present crowdfunding !
So here is a sketch of what we want a brick to be:

A mockup of what a brick will be in the next version
  

What do you think about it? 
Please tell us what you feel is lacking, or not so useful… 
You can really help us!
Collect inspirations from everywhere
Bricks allows you to collect inspirations images easily :

from your hard drive
from the web page 
from web services like Facebook, Instagram, Google Drive, Dropbox…


Thanks to your help, we want to build an integrated image library, that will allow you to search in one place in lots of stunning architecture sources, like architecture platforms (architizer, archilovers, archiref, dezeen…), tumblr blogs, flickr groups, pinterest…

You can define sub element inside an image and we store bricks relationship to be able to display you the hierarchy of elements


Workflow & Benefits

While working on your project, you are building a collaborative bricks library you can share easily with who you want.
Bricks helps you to design faster, to concentrate on the originality of your project, and to contribute to a shared knowledge base on which to start new projects.
At the same time when you are working on a specific project, you will also have access to a personal images library, where you can find all the images you have used in your projects and filter them by tags, usage…
This allows you to have a bird’s eye view of the work of all your team and reuse past inspirations in new projects.
You can set your projects sharing the same way as in google drive :

private
shared to a specific group of people
public and index by search engines

If you share your ""bricks of projects” publicly, you will allow people to build new design on past ideas, which has always been the way creative people have been working.

What we will do thanks to your support
You could  help us greatly, explaining us your specific needs. We need to understand how you are currently organizing your inspirations for your architecture and creatives work.
To develop Bricks more rapidly we need at least 10 000 US$ to give us the opportunity to work full time on the project for 2-3 months and have some exterior helps of web developers.

<p>Why
support Pueblo a Pueblo? Because we are child-centered, family-focused, and
community-based while addressing the needs of the indigenous families living in
rural Guatemala. Our programs are helping children attend and succeed in
school, keeping them healthy with regular medical check-ups, and improving
literacy at the primary school level. By working actively and directly with
community members, the goal is to create sustainable, long-lasting solutions to
the widespread poverty, illiteracy and poor health that afflict the 43,000
people in the Santiago Atitlan region of the country.  We
work ‘people-to-people’ to help people help themselves. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>There
 was a time when I thought getting a college degree while raising a 
toddler, working, and dealing with an abuser was impossible. My mentors 
showed me the path to success.<p>There was a time when I thought moving to a new city would be my ruin. My mentors supported me and helped me make it work.</p>
<p>There was a time when I thought unhappiness was the norm. My mentors showed me the truth.</p>
<p>With
 It's Business Time, I will be able to help others in the same way. I've
 already helped a former tutoring student find his way into one of the 
country's best universities - four years earlier he was failing. I've helped several people move out of dead
 end jobs and into jobs they love. I've provided the right written words
 when otherwise successful people have been at a loss to find them. And so much more.</p>Your contribution will help me continue that work.<br/><br/><div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>I may not raise all of the funds I need for

what it takes to help others because I have already done so. My hope is 
that friends, family, and strangers who love to champion the underdog 
will be my support system in this new adventure.<br/><br/><p>I would love to reach my entire goal through IndieGoGo, but
even if I don’t, I want to thank you for contributing. The funds raised, even
if I don’t hit the $5k goal will still go towards my membership in It’s Business

experience different states of awareness and to get in touch with the core of life process. <b>This program is offered not as a tour, but as a possibility for deep spiritual transformation.</b> This is something amazing for me, a chance for a great dream becoming reality.

••••••••••••••••••••••  THE IDEA  ••••••••••••••••••••••
This project is to bring help for children in Tamil Nadu, India and to help me fulfill my great dream. You can call it ""2 in 1 deep from the heart"".Once a year, Isha Foundation (est. 1992) organises the unique Himalaya trek for 35 participants, which is only on invitation basis. Each one has to make... 25 000$ donation, 85% of these funds then go to schools adopted by Isha. This trek is the fundraising created by Isha. And I have received the invitation in the end of April... but the donation is completely out of my range and the registration for this year's trek closes on 31 May 2015.This is the unique ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME Himalaya spiritual journey, which is - at the same time - the social NON-PROFIT communities intense development program (adoption of public schools in India and revamping the education model, to make it child-friendly, growth-supporting and break the poverty cycle this way).Please read and see, if you want to be part of this (please, feel free to ask questions if anything requires additional information).
•••••••••••••••••••••••••••• THE DEADLINE ••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
Actually, there are two deadlines :)In variant ""energy"" - until 31st May 2015In variant ""patience"" - until end of April 2016 (postponed a year)So, this or that way, but we can be successful :)In both scenarios the money will go directly to the Foundation. You can see more details in the following chapter ""Budget: where is the money going?"".Now, please aim at ""energy"". I will let you know in updates when the plan B is on.""Patience"" is more difficult as it involves waiting... :) but big goals need time to realise!UPDATE:Time to shift to plan B! It looks like there is too little time to gather necessary donation for this year. And Isha confirmed that my invitation will be still valid for 2016!!!So, I will continue my crowd-funding endeavour until the next year's trek. The CAMPAIGN WILL BE CONTINUED until April 2016!
••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••  BUDGET: WHERE IS THE MONEY GOING?  •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
Isha Foundation creates a long term projects on the large scale, which are then carrefully taken care of. They know that big results require wisdom and persistence. More descriptions of Isha projects you can see down below in the ""Isha Foundation"" section.This Isha foundrising bundle consists of two parts:••• PART 1 of this project (85% of funds or more):So, this HIMALAYAN TREK IS planned as a FUNDRAISING PROGRAM and 85% of the proceeds will go to the rural outreach projects of Isha Foundation
 (changing the education model in India to make it more child-friendly, 
and growth-supporting by adoption and revamping of public schools). The smaller part is for organizing the trek itself - that's how they deciced. Because of this… the required donation is set very high, far beyond my financial range.There are 100s of rural schools adopted by Isha in India to revamp the whole education system which is being a major role player for the upliftment of rural India.Isha changes the education system in India by three different initiatives:1) Isha has its own Isha Home School (a completely astonishing place, believe me I have seen many fantastic schools in my life, but this one is just amazing).2) Isha Vidhya (9 Rural Schools in Tamil Nadu & Andhra Pradesh, built by Isha with 5820 children, 58% of them on full scholarship and the rest on subsidised fees).3) Adoption of public schools in Tamil Nadu, Indie (aims to enhance the quality of education in Govt. schools and result in several thousands of children benefiting from a meaningful education).The Adoption of Public Schools program aims to deeply restructure the adopted schools, to make it child-friendly and growth-supporting.
Inducting teachers to teach remedial classes to mainstream the slow learners
Improving English language capabilities of children through other methodologies.
Infusing hitherto neglected aspects like Sports, Yoga, Arts & Crafts, Health, Hygiene & Environmental awareness, to bring all round development and sustain children’s interest in coming to school.   
Adding some badly needed infrastructure like toilets, computers, library books, etc.
Training Govt. school teachers to access and use classroom educational aids and digital content.
The necessary donation (per each participant) for this non-profit Isha Foundation project is  25 000 USD . So we need to gather minimum 27 500 $ (including indiegogo fees and transaction bank fees).BUT REMEMBER...••• EACH 5$ IS VERY IMPORTANT !!! •••AS DROPS MAKE THE OCEANOF COURSE,IF WE COLLECT MORE - THE DONATION WILL BE BIGGER :) (The additional costs of necessary preparations for the trek I will pay myself.)IF THE GOAL IS ONLY PARTLY REALISED - THE BLACK SCENARIO:
all gathered money go to children :)))
I do not go to Himalaya with Sadhguru neither this nor next year :(
BUT IT IS STILL GOOD !!!!! :)

VERY IMPORTANT: After the campaign is closed everyone will receive the scan of confirmation of donation
 for Isha Foundation by email or I will upload it to the updates 
section, with a registered number, which you can check at Isha directly.
••••• PART 2 of this project (15% of funds or less):I just have been offered a very unique opportunity to participate in the Himalayan 
trek with one of the greatest living Masters of ancient yoga, Sadhguru.This will be an intimate small group of people with a once-in-a-life 
time opportunity to travel for 21 days to the sacred spaces of Kailash 
and Manasarovar with each step guided by Sadhguru himself. This is a chance for me to 
experience different states of awareness and to get in touch with the core of life process. This program is offered not as a tour, but as a possibility for deep spiritual transformation. This is something amazing for me, a chance for a great dream becoming reality. I have invested so much in self development during my whole life - this would be time for harvest. The contact with spiritual Master is like using GPS in unknown terrain - something which could take long years to achieve you may reach in a matter of months. Sadhguru says it this way: ""GPS stands for Guru Positioning System"" :) “Manasarovar is a phenomena that defies human logic. There are not 
many things I can say about it. I think every human being who is 
interested in the nature of life; in the nature of life beyond us; in 
the nature of intelligence beyond us - must make a visit to this place 
because here is… it clearly defies our logic and intelligence.""– SadhguruAnd I am a seeker all my life asking questions about the nature of the existence. But also a sceptic and realist, who decided to gradually open toward spirituality. Not as some new age excitement but spirituality seen as an old science deeply rooted in the very core of construction of the universe. I was always extremely interested in the life itself but at the same time very cautious as a realist not to go some dead-end street. ""When you believe something does't mean you know it"" - like Sadhguru says. It's difficult not to agree with it, when you are aware that your mind is limited and likes the ruts of beaten track.""As we have physical science to create external well-being there is a whole inner dimension of science to create inner well being. I call it Inner Engineering.""- Sadhguru

•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••  THE ISHA FOUNDATION  •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
You may still wonder if money and enlightened spirituality go well together. Sadhguru is a very rare type of realized yogi and mistic. He is both the enlightened being and a man of the world. He is not sitting in some cave, though he’s one of the biggest yogis on the planet.So, sometimes you can see him riding his bike :)As he says it himself ""...being spiritual does not necessary mean being impractical...""But...This life for me is an endeavor to help people experience and express their divinity. May you know the bliss of the Divine.” – Sadhguru“There is only one business in the world and that is of human wellbeing.” – SadhguruHe has founded in 1992 Isha as a non-profit foundation which is strongly engaged in helping people in poor rural areas in India. Isha conducts their projects, with both medical and social help, curing people, engaging them in different activities or building schools for children. Isha is running also other initiatives, like The Project GreenHands (PGH). This environmental project aims to increase the green cover of the state of Tamil Nadu to the required 33%, by planting 114 million trees. PGH set a Guinness World Record on 17th October, 2006 for planting maximum number of saplings in a single day ( 852 587 saplings).Sadghuru is also engaged in contact with economic leaders to rich through them a significant influence on people's life who are dependent on these leaders. He is a participant of many important economic international forums, like Davos.Above you can watch the talk with Vinita Bali, an Indian businesswoman who is the Managing Director and CEO of Britannia Industries Limited.Above you can watch the talk with a well known Indian television journalist Barkha Dutt.Isha’s powerful yoga programs for inner transformation and inspiring projects for society and environment are appreciated worldwide, reflecting in Isha's consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council.
They need real money to do this! Spirituality and sitting in cave is not enough to achieve such goals.
Drawn from the essence of the ancient yogic sciences, Sadhguru offers  many Yogic Programs through Isha Foundation. These are fine distilled and very powerful programs, mostly kriya practices influencing directly ones energies. At the same time they are relatively little time consuming and easy to learn. In spite of kriyas, Isha is also offering yogaasanas programs.This is the core of ancient yoga, in pure Patanjali way of teaching which is an extremely rare thing to find in the world now. This means yoga, without geographical and cultural transformations gathered over thousands of years, gradually changing the face and the meaning of yoga. Isha is teaching us just the essence of ancient yoga knowledge about construction of the universe, discovering the source of creation inside us and above all how to experience blissfulness.Did you know, that this ancient yogic knowledge is confirmed by concepts and discoveries of modern sciences?Did you know that in yogic lore Shiva does not mean a hindu god? It literaly means ""that which is not"" and this refers exactly to what modern phisics calls dark matter and dark energy. The vast part of existence which is not in our perception right now, but is the basis of the physical existence as we know it. The intelligence which is far beyond human one and which constructs the whole universe.
••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••  MY YOGA PRACTICE  ••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
See updates tab for a short story behind this picture (update #3).I am deeply engaged in yoga practice now (do not mistake this for twisting the body in strange postures) - 2 hours daily. But when I started I could not believe the range of changes I have experienced just after 3 months of a most basic kriya practice (Shambhavi Mahamudra, 21 minutes to complete). It was completely surprising to me. But it was my experience and it was hard to deny.  There are two types of the mistake on the way to know better the world and I wanted to avoid both of them. One - when you accept many things easily, without hesitation, and thus you are drawn into you own imagination. The other one, when you reject everything which does not fit your current model of assumptions and thus you cannot go beyond your current beliefs.The changes I've experienced at the beginning:1) I stopped getting colds (I was getting cold once a month and worried there is something very wrong with my health)2) The most difficult emotions are smoothed to the degree I couldn't believe - the life become so much easier :)3) My thought process become even brighter (though thinking was always a strong side of me)So I wanted more. You always want to expand. :) So, I do many more ancient yoga practices right now. And I want it all. I want to go beyond our common level of perceiving reality. Of course, this doesn't mean I want loose my mind :) I simply want to experience the core of creation and blissfulness. This Himalayan trek with Sadhguru is a milestone step in this direction. I know it so intensely. The contact with the master is something difficult to overestimate. This is like using GPS in unknown terrain - something which could take long years to achieve you may reach in a matter of months.In the whole yoga system everything is a matter of experience, not a matter of a somebody's else belief. Thus the only way is to try it yourself.

As he sat with his eyes open, suddenly he slipped into a state where he could not differentiate between himself and his surroundings. It was a staggering explosion. “What was ‘me’ was everywhere.” After nearly four hours, which felt like only a few minutes, he came back to his usual self. He found himself drenched in tears, while his mind grappled to find an explanation – “Something was happening within me. I did not know what it was. All I knew was – I’ve hit a goldmine and I didn’t want to lose it.”WATCH how he describes HIS EXPERIENCE here at google INK Conference at 2009.Well, one may say Sadhguru’s capabilities are in the scope of Gautama the Buddha.""Everything in the existence, every physical form, is a question of geometry. Whether something functions smoothly or not essentially depends upon the perfection of geometry. The whole system of hatha yoga is just this – to fix your geometry in such a way that this machine will function without any friction within itself. Only when there is no inner friction you are no longer an issue. But if just existing here is an issue, where is the question of scaling the peaks of consciousness? Such a thing will not occur to you. Only when everything is at ease can you take something on. When you are not an issue, you can attend to anything you want. Or, you can close your eyes and sit – both the choices are here.""- Sadhguru

••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••  JAKI TO PROJEKT?  •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
Ten projekt niesie duza pomoc dla dzieci w Tamil Nadu, Indie oraz pomoc dla mnie w spelnieniu mojego wielkiego marzenia. W sumie jest to takie ""2 w 1 gleboko od serca"".Fundacja Isha (rok zal. 1992) organizuje raz w roku niezwykla wyprawe w Himalaje dla 35 uczestnikow, w ktorej mozna wziac udzial po otrzymaniu zaproszenia. Kazdy uczestnik musi zrobic donacje w wysokosci... 25 000$, a 85% tej kwoty zostaje przeznaczona na pomoc szkolom zaadoptowanym prze Isha. Ta wyprawa jest sposobem w jaki Isha zbiera pieniadze na cele swojej fundacji. Pod koniec kwietnia otrzymalem zaproszenie od Isha... ale donacja jest calkowicie poza moim zasiegiem, a rejestracja na wyprawe konczy sie 31 maja 2015.Mam szanse na doświadczenie, które zdarza sie RAZ W ZYCIU - duchowa wyprawa w Himalaje. Jednoczesnie, ta wyprawa jest zbiorka pieniedzy na program fundacji NON-PROFIT,  wspierajacy rozwoj dzieci w ubogich spolecznosciach (poprzez adopcje szkol publicznych, aby zmienic model edukacji na przyjazny dzieciom i wspierajacy ich rozwoj - zeby przerwac cykl ubostwa w tych regionach).Przeczytajcie i zobaczcie czy chcielibyście pomóc mi w tym (i prosze pytajcie mnie o wszystko, cokolwiek wydaloby sie nie dosc jasne).
••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• DO KIEDY TRWA ZBIORKA? •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
W zasadzie, to są dwa terminy zakonczenia zbiorki :)W wariancie ""energia"" - do 31 Maja 2015W wariancie ""cierpliwosc"" - do konca kwietnia 2016 (pozniej o rok)W ten sposob, tak czy siak moze sie udac :)W obu scenariuszach pieniadze trafia bezposrednio do fundacji Isha. Wiecej informacji znajdziesz w nastepnym rozdziale ""Budzet: na co ida te pieniadze?""Na razie, prosze nastawiaj sie na wariant ""energia"". Dam znac w 'updates' jesli przejdziemy do planu B.""Cierpliwosc"" jest trudniejsza wersja, bo wymaga czekania... :) ale duze cele wymagaja czasu na realizacje!UPDATE:Czas przejsc do planu B! Widac, ze zostalo za malo czasu, zeby uzbierac potrzebna kwote na ten rok. Mam potwierdzenie od Isha, ze moje zaproszenie zachowuje waznosc na rok 2016! :)Bede wiec kontynuowal ten projekt crowd-fundingowy do przyszlego roku. Czyli kampania będzie prowadzona do kwietnia 2016! :)

Fundacja Isha tworzy dlugoterminowe programy pomocy, na duza skale, ktore sa pozniej realizowane z duzo starannoscia. Doskonale wiedza, ze do osiagniecia duzych celow potrzeba madrosci i wytrwalosci. Wiecej opisow innych projektow fundacji mozna znalezc w podrozdziale ""Fundacja Isha"" w tekscie ponizej.Ten projekt zbiorki pieniedzy przez Isha jest zestawem zlozonych z dwoch czesci: ••• CZESC 1 tego projektu (85% funduszy lub wiecej):Ta jedyna w swoim rodzaju WYPRAWA W HIMALAJE JEST POMYSLANA PRZEZ ISHA JAKO ZBIORKA FUNDUSZY, a 85% zebranych środkow zostanie przeznaczone na  wiejskie programy pomocowe prowadzone przez Fundacje Isha
 (zmiana modelu edukacji w Indiach na przyjazny dzieciom, wspierajacy 
ich rozwoj, poprzez adopcje szkol publicznych i objecie ich opieka 
Isha). Mniejsza czesc kwoty idzie na organizowanie samej wyprawy. Dlatego... wymagana donacja od kazdego uczestnika jest ustalona bardzo wysoko. Niestety, zupelnie poza zasiegiem moich mozliwosci.Fundacja Isha zaadoptowala 100-ki wiejskich szkol
 w Indiach, zeby przebudowac caly system edukacji, ktory ma ogromy wplyw na poprawianie warunkow zycia ludzi z wiejsckich obszarow Indii. Kiedy edukacja sprzyja dzieciom, pozwala na wyrwanie ludzi z zakletego kregu ubostwa. Taka zbiorka Isha organizuje co roku.Isha zmienia system edukacji w Indiach prowadzac trzy rozne inicjatywy:1) storzyli swoja wlasna Isha Home School (zupelnie niezwykle miejsce, wierzcie, ze widzialem juz kilka wspanialych szkol w swoim zyciu, ale ta na prawde oczarowujaca)2) Isha Vidhya (9 wiejskich szkol w Tamilnadu i Andhra Pradesh, zbudowanych przez Isha. Chodzi do nich 5820 dzieci, 58% z nich ma pelne stupendium a reszta jest na czesciowym wsparciu)3) Adopcja szkol publicznych w Tamilnadu, Indie (w celu poprawy sposobu nauczania w tych szkolach, tak zeby dziesiatki tysiecy dzieci w tych szkolach mogly otrzymac dobra, wspierajaca edukacje)Celem programu Adopcji Szkol Publicznych jest gleboka przebudowa sposobu nauczania w tych szkolach, zeby staly sie przyjazne dzieciom i wspierajace ich rozwoj.
poprawa w poslugiwaniu sie przez dzieci jezykiem angielskim, poprzez wlaczenie innych metod nauczania,

szkolenia zawodowe dla nauczycieli z tych szkol publicznych, zeby w bogatszy i ciekawy sposob prowadzili lekcje, stosujac urozmaicone pomoce, w tym komputery.
Potrzebna donacja dla Fundacji Isha (non-profit) wynosi w tym projekcie 25 000 USD (na kazdego uczestnika wyprawy). Zalezy mi dlatego, zeby zebrac 27 500 $ (uwzgledniajac oplaty platformy indiegogo oraz oplaty bankowe).

••••• CZESC 2 tego projektu (15% funduszy lub mniej):To mozliwosc udzialu w wyprawie w Himalaje z jednym z wielkich obecnie zyjacych mistrzow starozytnej jogi, Sadhguru.Niewielka grupa uczestnikow bedzie miala niepowtarzalna w zyciu szanse podrozowac przez 21 dni do Kailash i Manasarowar, pod przewodnictwem Sadhguru. Sa to miejsca o szczególnym znaczeniu duchowym, z niezwyklymi wlasciwosciami energetycznymi. Dla mnie jest to szansa na doswiadczenie stanow poszerzonej swiadomosci i dotknięcie rdzenia procesu zycia. Ta wyprawa jest pomyslana nie jako turystyka, tylko jako okazja na gleboka duchowa przemiane. Jest to coś absolutnie niezwyklego dla mnie, szansa, zeby spelnilo sie wielkie marzenie. Przez cale zycie zainwestowalem ogromna ilosc energii w rozwoj, prace nad soba - to jest szansa na zbieranie owocow. Mistrz duchowy jest jak GPS w nieznanym terenie - cos co mogloby trwac dlugie lata mozesz zrobic w miesiace. Jak mowi Sadhguru, GPS oznacza Guru Positioning System. :) “Manasarovar jest zjawiskiem, ktore stawia wyzwanie logice ludzkiego umyslu. Niewiele rzeczy moge teraz o nim powiedziec. Uwazam, ze kazdy czlowiek, ktorego ciekawi czym jest natura procesu zycia; natura procesu zycia poza zyciem jakie sami znamy; natura inteligencji wykraczajaca poza ta jaka znamy sami - powinien odwiedzic to miejsce, poniewaz... w bardzo przejrzysty sposob stawia ono wyzwanie naszej ludzkiej logice i inteligencji.""– SadhguruPrzez cale zycie zadawalem pytania o zycie, istnienie i szukalem odpowiedzi. Jestem tez sceptykiem i realista, ktory zdecydowal sie stopniowo otworzyc na duchowosc. Nie chodzi mi o rodzaj podekscytowania w stylu new age, ale o stabilny rozwoj duchowosci, osadzonej w starozytnej wiedzy jogicznej, w zasadach konstruujacych wszechswiat.Od zawsze bylem niezwykle zaciekawiony zyciem jako takim, a rownoczesnie bylem ostroznym realista. Zalezalo mi, zeby nie utknac w jakims slepym zaulku posiadanych przekonan. ""To, ze jestes o czyms przekonany nie znaczy, ze to wiesz"" - jak mowi Sadhguru. Trudno sie z tym nie zgodzic, jesli wiemy, ze nasz umysl ma ograniczenia i lubi koleiny utartych sciezek.""Podobnie jak mamy nauki fizyczne, zeby tworzyc zewnetrzny dobrostan , istnieje caly wewnetrzny wymiar nauki sluzacy temu, by tworzyc wewnetrzny dobrostan. Nazywam go  Wewnetrzna Inzynieria.""- Sadhguru

••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••  FUNDACJA ISHA  ••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
Byc moze nadal zastanawiasz sie, czy pieniadze ida w parze z oswiecona duchowoscia. Sadhguru jest bardzo rzadko spotykanym rodzajem spelnionego jogina i mistyka. Jest osoba oswiecona i... ""czlowiekiem swiata"". Nie siedzi samotnie medytujac w jaskini, chociaz jest jednym z najwiekszych joginow na naszej planecie.Tak wiec, czasami mozna zobaczyc go jak pedzi na motocyklu :)Jak sam mówi ""...bycie uduchowionym nie musi oznaczać bycia niepraktycznym..."".Jednak...To zycie jest dla mnie wysilkiem, aby pomoc ludziom doswiadczyc boskosci i wyrazic ich wlasna boskosc. Tak bys zaznal blogosci, ktora plynie z kontaktu z boskoscia w tobie.” – Sadhguru“Istnieje tylko jeden biznes na swiecie i dotyczy on dobrostanu ludzi.” – SadhguruSadhguru w 1992 roku zalozyl Isha, fundacje non-profit. Jest to organizacja mocno zaangazowana w niesienie pomocy ludziom w biednych obszarach wiejskich w Indiach. Fundacja udziela pomocy medycznej i spolecznej - leczac ludzi, angazujac ich w rozne aktywnosci (np. formy rękodziela) i budujac lub adoptujac istniejace juz szkoly dla dzieci. Isha jest takze zaangazowana w rozne inne dzialania, np. Projekt GreenHands (PGH). Jest to inicjatywa srodowiskowa Fundacji, ktorej celem jest zwiekszenie pokrywy zielonej w stanie Tamil Nadu do 33%, wymaganych dla przywrocenia rownowagi srodowiska. W tym celu zostanie posadzonych 114 milionow drzew. Pobito juz rekord Guinessa - 17 pazdziernika 2006 posadzono najwieksza ilosc sadzonek drzew w ciagu jednego dnia (852 587 sadzonek) :)Sadghuru jest rowniez zaangazowany w kontakty z liderami ekonomicznymi, chcac poprzez nich zyskac wplyw na poprawe jakosci zycia wielu milionow ludzi, ktorych zycie w znacznej mierze jest zalezne od postawy tych liderow. Osobiscie bral udzial w wielu miedzynarodowych forach ekonomicznych, jak np. w Davos.Powyzej mozecie obejrzec jedna z rozmow z ekonomicznymi liderami, tutaj z Vinita Bali, hinduska businesswoman, Dyrektor Zarzadzajaca i CEO Britannia Industries Limited.Powyzej mozecie obejrzec rozmowe ze znana indyjska dziennikarka telewizyjna Barkha Dutt.Stworzone przez Isha programy nauki jogi maja ogromna sile oddzialywania, powodujac glebokie wewnetrzne przemiany. Podobnie jak inspirujace projekty sluzace spolecznosciom i srodowisku sa one doceniane na calym swiecie, co znajduje odbicie w przydzielonym Isha statusie doradcy przy Radzie Gospodarczej i Spolecznej ONZ.
Fundacja potrzebuje prawdziwych pieniedzy, zeby udzielac takiej pomocy!Duchowosc i siedzenie w jaskini nie wystarczaja same w sobie do osiagniecia takich celow.
Sadhguru oferuje poprzez Fundacje Isha wiele programow jogi, wywodzacych sie z rdzenia wiedzy starozytnej jogi. Sa to szczegolowo dopracowane programy o bardzo duzej sile oddzialywania, glownie praktyki krija jogi, dzialajace bezposrednio na procesy energetyczne w organizmie i na fizjologię calego organizmu. Przy tym praktyki te sa tak skonstruowane, ze wymagaja wzglednie malo czasu oraz sa latwe do nauczenia. Poza praktykami krija jogi, Isha oferuje rowniez programy uczace kluczowych asan jogi (karma joga). Jest to rdzen starozytnej jogi, w czystym przekazie Patanjali, a wiec.. pierwotna forma jogi, bardzo trudna do odnalezienie obecnie na swiecie. Programy te nie maja nalecialosci regionalnych i kulturowych gromadzących się przez tysiace lat, ktore zmienily oblicze i znaczenie jogi. Jest to sama esencja starozytnej wiedzy o budowie wszechswiata, o tym jak odkryc zrodlo stworzenia wewnatrz nas samych i osiągnąć stabilny dobrostan.Czy wiesz, ze przekaz starozytnej jogi znajduje swoje potwierdzenie w koncepcjach i odkryciach wspolczesnej nauki?Czy wiesz, ze w tradycji jogi Shiva nie oznacza hinduskiego boga? Shiva doslownie oznacza ""to czego nie ma"" i odnosi sie dokladnie to tego samego zjawiska, ktore wspolczesna fizyka nazywa ciemna materia i ciemna energia. Do zjawiska, ktore jest wieksza czescia wszechswiata i jest zrodlem tego istnienia, a ktore znamy z wlasnego doswiadczenia jako rzeczywistosc fizykalna. Do inteligencji, ktora wykracza daleko poza ludzki umysl, i ktora konstruuje caly wszechswiat.
••••••••••••••••••••••••  MOJA JOGA  •••••••••••••••••••••••••
Zobacz w zakładce ""updates"" krótki opis historii wokół tego zdjęcia (update nr 3).Jestem gleboko zaangazowany w praktyke jogi (prosze nie mylcie tego z wyginaniem ciala w roznych przedziwnych pozycjach), codziennie okolo 2 godziny przeznaczam na joge. Jednak musze przyznac, ze kiedy zaczynalem praktykowac, nie myslalem, jak wielu zmian doswiadcze zaledwie po 3 miesiacach najbardziej podstawowej praktyki krija jogi (Shambhavi Mahamudra, 21 minut na wykonanie). Bylo to dla mnie duzym zaskoczeniem.  Jednak to jest moje doswiadczenie i trudno mu zaprzeczac.  Sa dwa rodzaje bledu w poznawaniu swiata, a zadnego z nich nie chcialem popelnic: albo zbyt latwo cos uznajemy i budujemy fantazyjne przekonania, albo zbyt szybko odrzucamy to, co nie pasuje do naszego modelu swiata i nie mozemy poznac nic wiecej, niz pozwala nasz dotychczasowy system przekonan .Zmiany których doswiadczylem:1) przestalem sie przeziebiac (przedtem przeziebialem sie conajmniej raz w miesiacu, juz nawet zaczalem powaznie sie martwic, ze moj organizm najwyrazniej szwankuje)2) najtrudniejsze dla mnie emocje staly sie duzo mniej intensywne i krotsze; zmiana nastapila w takim stopniu, ze nie moglem w to uwierzyc - zycie stalo sie o wiele latwiejsze :)3) moj proces myslenia stal sie jeszcze jasniejszy (choc myslenie zawsze bylo moja mocna strona ;) )Zapragnalem wiecej. Czy znasz... takie pragnienie, zeby poszerzac swoje mozliwosci? :) Obecnie robie wiele praktyk ze starozytnej jogi. Jestem gotow, by dotrzec do pelni. Chcialbym przekroczyc obecny zakres percepcji rzeczywistosci. Oczywiscie, to nie oznacza, ze chcialbym stracic rozum, czy ""odleciec"" :) Po prostu chcialbym sam doswiadczyc kontaktu ze zrodlem stworzenia. Ta wyprawa w Himalaje z Sadhguru jest milowym krokiem w tym kierunku. Jestem o tym gleboko przekonany. Kontakt z mistrzem jest czyms trudnym do przecenienia. To jak GPS w nieznanym terenie - cos co mogloby trwac dlugie lata mozesz zrobic w miesiace.W calym systemie jogi wszystko jest oparte na namacalnym doswiadczeniu, a nie na poleganiu na czyichs przekonaniach. Dlatego jedynym sposobem poznania jest osobiste doswiadczenie, sprawdzenie na wlasnej skorze.

Slowo ‘Isha’ oznacza pierwotne zrodlo stworzenia nieposiadajace formy . Kto za tym wszystkim stoi? Zobaczcie:
Oswiecenie Sadhguru.
Popoludniem 23 wrzesnia 1982 roku mlody biznesmen usiadl w swoim ulubionym miejscu na wzgorzu Chamundi. Kiedy siedzial tam z otwartymi oczami, nagle osunal sie w stan, w ktorym nie mogl rozroznic pomiedzy soba i swoim otoczeniem. To bylo jak zdumiewajaca eksplozja. ""To co bylo ""mna"" bylo wszedzie."" Po niemal 4 godzinach, ktore odczuwal jak kilka minut, powrocil do zwyklego poczucia siebie. Odkryl, ze jest we lzach, a jego umysl racjonalisty zmagal sie, zeby znalezc jakies wyjasnienie tego, co się z nim dzialo – “Wewnatrz mnie cos dzialo sie. Nie wiedzialem co. Jedyne co wiedzialem, to ze trafilem na skarb i nie chce go utracic.""ZOBACZCIE jak opisuje SWOJE DOSWIADCZENIE tutaj w google na Konferencji INK w 2009.Mozna powiedziec, ze Sadhguru nie ustepuje w swym doswiadczeniu i mozliwosciach Buddzie Gautama.""Wszystko w istnieniu, kazda fizyczna forma, jest kwestia geometrii. To czy cos funkcjonuje z latwoscia czy nie, podstawowo zalezy od perfekcji geometrii. Caly system hata yogi polega na tym - popraw swoja geometrie w taki sposob, zeby to urzadzenie moglo funkcjonowac bez tarc wewnatrz siebie. Dopiero kiedy nie ma wewnetrznego tarcia przestajesz byc problemem. Jednak kiedy juz samo istnienie stanowi dla ciebie problem, gdzie jest miejsce na pytanie o zwiekszanie zakresu swiadomosci? W takiej sytuacji to nie moze sie ci przydarzyc. Dopiero kiedy wszystko funkcjonuje z latwoscia mozesz sie czegos podjac. Kiedy nie jestes juz problemem, mozesz zajac sie czymkolwiek zechcesz. Albo - mozesz zamknac oczy i siedziec - oba wybory sa dostepne.""- Sadhguru

To help the victims restore and regain the physical and mental trauma, we have decided to raise the fund and transfer to Gothalo Nepal. The team ,which has done exceptional social contributions in the past can be trusted to channelize the funds to the actual victims. In continuation of their social engagements, the team  successfully raised funds globally last year and  provided necessities to flood victims in Far Western Nepal. To see the details of the previous social engagement of the group please click Here.
Like all of you, we are deeply concerned and sorrowed about the massive disaster, the earthquake has brought forth. Hence, we are seeking to bring people virtually together, create a fund and try help the actual victims via ""Gothalo Nepal"". 

 By donating you are helping someone and their families just like ours - it will mean a lot to them. 
What We Seek
Any possible amount from your pockets can help build a considerable amount. Our dedicated ""Gothalo Nepal "" team will  definitely reach out the needy and offer help in any means deemed suitable. 

No doubt, your contribution made by cutting your expenses will restore the life, if not help pacify the physical and emotional wounds of the disaster. It is  much more than the prayers offered in the temples, mosque and church. The raised fund , transfers and usage of the funds will be updated as we go further. 

The Impact 
Nepal has, for the past decades been struggling itself on the widespread issues of fundamental human conditions - malnutrition, clean water, sanitation, epidemics, child labor, illiteracy, human trafficking, extreme poverty, electricity, cooking gas and many more  - Poverty in Nepal . Therefore, to a poor country like Nepal,  Earthquake disaster means a  massive  problem to cope up with wherein the supply of economic, human , medical, food and water resources  is rare, if not very hard to manage.  

Straightforwardly, the fundraising is intended to establish an economic resource , so that it can be directed to the individuals and family who have , 1)  Lost their loved ones for ever  2) Been seriously injured and cant afford  3) Have faced severe economic loss  4)Deeply traumatized with the human and economic losses 
Your valuable contribution of any amount can help save a child, restore health, reassure the traumatized and pacify the wounds. Lets not make this longer - , lets be united , lets donate and lets offer help from our possible means.

A Recap: Why Chileans Need English.(aka things that we native
speakers often take for granted):
Economic
1. In Chile an estimated 75% of the working population has
missed a job opportunity because they have a low level of English.
2. An intermediate level of English affords an average 30% increase in
income.
Academic- 
1. Over 80% of the world’s academic journals are in English,
and many of the most highly merited Universities teach their programs in
English.  
2. Even within Chile, university students are expected to read the latest scientific studies and research.  Most of which are published in English. 
Communicative- 
1. Twelve international domains, including business, transportation and diplomacy, have designated English as their official language.
2. Over 1 billion
people worldwide are currently learning English.  It is has truly become the preferred language for
global communication making travel, studies and business much easier for anyone that speaks it.

Risks & Challenges
The success of our work is closely
tied to the institutions that we work with and their posture towards
change.  In addition, educational
improvements become apparent over years rather than months.  The greatest risks therefore are related to
funding the program for the amount of time needed to make significant impact.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>My Best Summary of the Last 5 Years of Hard Work</strong></h3>
<p>   </p>
<p>My name is Jason Lalli, I am a passionate agent for change who has been working in our communities as a poet, event organizer (Infuse - Open Mic &amp; Phoenix Fesitival of the Arts), and motivational speaker since 2009. I strive to be the change I wish to see by building stronger communities for a better future. </p>
<p>   I began the journey of positively stimulating a new conversation around bullying because I realized a major contrast in the world I grew up in and the one my son is growing up in. I looked back at a younger me knowing that if I had learned life-skills training like; how to communicate, self-/social-awareness, the difference between conflict and bullying, the power of my voice, positive coping skills, and so much more then it would have had a tremendous impact on my life.  I felt I truly had something that would make a major difference.  I have spoken hundreds of times to thousands of students and there is no greater reward than building their trust, empowering their abilities to use their voice by asking for help, and embracing every possibility to show them what support and community really feels like. </p>
<p>   You as a contributor will be empowering youth with essential life tools to navigate not only bullying but conflict. Your financial contribution has the potential to literally help a child find a better future through empowerment, better decision making, self-awareness, and an understanding to the responsibility of choice. You will also be helping support and empower educators to feel more prepared in supporting our youth through the challenges of living in today's world as a teen. </p>

<p>   2.  The second, is more intensive as a 3.5 month program where an entire grade receives seven presentations. One introductory and six workshops.

My name is Jason Lalli, I am a passionate agent for change who has been working in our communities as a poet, event organizer (Infuse - Open Mic & Phoenix Fesitival of the Arts), and motivational speaker since 2009. I strive to be the change I wish to see by building stronger communities for a better future. 
   I began the journey of positively stimulating a new conversation around bullying because I realized a major contrast in the world I grew up in and the one my son is growing up in. I looked back at a younger me knowing that if I had learned life-skills training like; how to communicate, self-/social-awareness, the difference between conflict and bullying, the power of my voice, positive coping skills, and so much more then it would have had a tremendous impact on my life.  I felt I truly had something that would make a major difference.  I have spoken hundreds of times to thousands of students and there is no greater reward than building their trust, empowering their abilities to use their voice by asking for help, and embracing every possibility to show them what support and community really feels like.

Darmetreis Kilgore. I grew up in a fatherless environment as a troubled youth.
I was bullied as a child. One of the main reasons I was bullied was because I
would have to wear some of my mother’s pants to school. She was unable to buy me
my own pair of pants at the time. I went from being troubled to causing my
opponents trouble on the basketball court. I played for Hall of Fame Coach,
Gene Keady, at Purdue University; and later went on to participate in the
Philadelphia 76er’s NBA free agent camp. </p>
<p>“Finding Me” tells my
story. This story will touch millions of people across the world. Our troubled
youth need to know that others have experienced distinctively similar trials.
My book, “Finding Me”, is a journey that takes place during the unsure times of
adolescent years. I believe this book will transcend throughout the minds of
troubled youth and help land them smoothly, right into adulthood. Throughout
life we are searching for ourselves. “Finding Me” will elaborate on that
searching and show how everything I have experienced in my life has finally
come full circle.</p>
<p>With your contribution,
my book “Finding Me” will give young men and women hope. It will encourage
them to face adversity with the understanding that hardships help to shape who
we are. It will also give them a clearer understanding that struggles can work
in your favor if you let God do what He does best; <b>His Will</b>. </p>
<p>I will need $1000 to
publish, edit, and market my e-book. One of the unique perks that I have
to offer is that if you register on our website, you will get the first 2
chapters of my book for free. If you are unable to give a donation, please at
least get the word out. Help me make some noise about my campaign. A great
resource to do so is the Indiegogo share tool. Thank you for your support and
efforts! I am very excited to reveal my life changing story to the public.</p><br/>

</h2><br/>
<p>Pinball is an excellent tool for skill development. It's based in play, the primary occupational role of a child and therefore intrinsically motivating. As a game, pinball engages the child in active play and creates a welcome distraction from the traditional demands of therapeutic exercise. It  provides significant opportunities to practice and improve gross and fine motor skills and coordinated movements, especially those involved in vision. And of course, it's an incredibly fun game that can be naturally incorporated into a social activity or a broader social skills program.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h2><b>The Pinball Education Center</b></h2><div>Your support and financial contribution will assist us with one of our main initiatives for 2015:  Opening our flagship location in the DC area.

<h2><b>Meet The Artists</b></h2>
<p></p>
<p>We've commissioned two professional artists to make unique pinball-related artwork. Here's a little bit about them.</p>
<h4>Goodloe Byron</h4>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Goodloe Byron is an author, artist and musician from Frederick, Maryland. Byron's artistic career developed from drawing book covers for his own novels. From 2006-2010 he traveled throughout the United States handing out 40,000 copies of his first two books. He then went on to work for independent presses. Byron's first illustration for the New York based press, Soft Skull, was featured in the New York Times in 2010. Byron is well-known for his whimsical caricature-like sketch drawings of Frederick locals and bands as well as his self-portraits and countless paintings of his dog, Pugloe.</p>
<p>In a 2012 interview with the Frederick News-Post, Goodloe shared, ""It's a challenge and reward to draw people and see them enjoy it. It's people that make life interesting.""

<p>“I love pinball.  I believe it has untapped potential and value as an educational and therapeutic tool.  I want to share it with everyone.”</p>
<p>Joe brings over 15 years of experience making education accessible to people with disabilities.

<p>Cristin introduced her son to pinball in 2012  by joining a local pinball league.</p>
<p>“I knew Ethan would love playing but I didn’t realize how much he would grow as an individual through playing. Pinball has provided him with an opportunity to develop social skills and friendships with other people who also love to play. This shared interest in pinball has motivated him to learn about the rules of pinball, improved his focus and communication skills.”</p>
<p>Cristin is a licensed certified pediatric Occupational Therapist who has worked with families and their children for over 15 years both privately through her own practice and publicly through State and County Early Intervention programs. She is also the  parent of a young adult with Down Syndrome and has over 20 years experience as a skilled special needs education and inclusion advocate. Her  experience and expertise includes working with children and adults with disabilities in schools, hospitals, outpatient centers, and home-based settings.</p>

<p>Kathy remembers playing pinball back in the day when it was at the height of popularity. Her father lived in Southern California. While all her friends were sun-tanning on the beach in Santa Monica, she was in the arcade on the Pier, pale but happy.  She was thrilled when her middle child, Robert, began to show an interest in <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">pinball at an early age. At the time, he had a hard time staying still and concentrating, and pinball seemed to be one of the few activities he could do for a long period of time.</span></p>
<p>Robert was diagnosed with Autistic Disorder at about the age of 5, and Kathy began to notice that not only he liked pinball, but he seemed to be very good at it.  Robert stopped playing for a few years, but took it up again in his late teens, and she credits a huge leap in his communication and social skills to pinball. Through pinball, her family, and especially Robert, have met so many nice people and have had many unique opportunities as a result of pinball-related travelling to tournaments and shows. Her professional background includes special education, and she currently practices as a certified school psychologist.</p>

</div>","Our MissionThank you for your interest in our Indiegogo campaign. We're Pinball EDU, a nonprofit focused on using pinball as a tool for education and therapy.  We believe pinball can be used to motivate, teach, and build critical developmental skills for children. Join us in support of our mission. Why Pinball?


Pinball is an excellent tool for skill development. It's based in play, the primary occupational role of a child and therefore intrinsically motivating. As a game, pinball engages the child in active play and creates a welcome distraction from the traditional demands of therapeutic exercise. It  provides significant opportunities to practice and improve gross and fine motor skills and coordinated movements, especially those involved in vision. And of course, it's an incredibly fun game that can be naturally incorporated into a social activity or a broader social skills program.The Pinball Education CenterYour support and financial contribution will assist us with one of our main initiatives for 2015:  Opening our flagship location in the DC area. The Pinball Education Center will provide us with the space we need to begin many local and national projects as well as give us the opportunity to begin engaging the local community in data collection and research to validate the use of pinball for STEM education and therapeutic intervention.STEM Hands-on Pinball MuseumThe Pinball Education Center will support science, technology, engineering, and math education through its many educational programs. Our center will serve as a destination for field trips for DC, Maryland, and Virginia area schools, a hands-on family arcade and museum, and will pilot an after school program for local youth.
GiftsWe love pinball, especially its fascinating history and inspiring artwork. We wanted to share our passion for all things pinball with our sponsors as we truly value your involvement and support of our mission.  Each donation is greatly appreciated and we hope our gifts will serve as a small thank you from Pinball EDU as well as a proud reminder of your contribution.

<p>My name is Arnold Bhebhe and I am a Lecturer in Creative Industries at Edinburgh Napier University, United Kingdom. I was born and bred at Inyathi, a mission station 45 miles north of the city of Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. My parents were school teachers there and were passionate about the educational development of the local community. We were a family of nine children and times were generally hard for black people in the then Rhodesia, yet my parents somehow had the strength and ability to 'adopt' some local young people who, just like us, they sent to school. Today,  those boys and girls are people of stature within the community as responsible and useful citizens of the world. <br/></p>
<p>In the heart of the then Matabele Kingdom, the Inyathi Mission was founded in 1859 by a Scottish Missionary Robert Moffat, the father in-law of the celebrated Dr David Livingstone.  Inyathi became the first evangelical mission station in Zimbabwe to offer education to the native people of the country.  This Mission Station has barely transformed as an educational institution compared to other institutions that were founded later in other parts of Zimbabwe, a number of which offer tertiary education up to university level.   Because Inyathi only offers primary and secondary education the vast communities of Matabeleland North still remain underdeveloped. <br/></p>
<p>The 1980s post independence dissident activity in Matabeleland meant that the government of Zimbabwe disinvested from the region and unleashed a crack army unit which massacred over 20 000 civilians, including my own brother and sister.  Most of the victims were bread winners,  professionals and experts in various fields including education, health, agriculture and trade. A lot more were displaced with some  seeking sanctuary in neighbouring countries where  many remain.

</p>
<p>With the loss of these breadwinners, surviving children could not meaningfully pursue their education as they had to seek employment to fend for their siblings. The mass murders and exodus of teachers also meant that the schools lacked adequate professionals. For this reason, the government has over the years imported teaching staff many of whom neither speak the local language nor identify with the culture of the communities in the region. In many cases, these  teachers are deployed to teach at the crucial levels of Primary School where the mother tongue plays a central role in helping pupils grasp learning concepts. As a result, academic attainment has been generally low with a noticeable lack of enthusiasm and incentive in learning among youngsters. An alternative for them is to skip the border to seek employment abroad as they cannot make it at home.</p>
<p>WHY THE UNIVERSITY:          <br/></p>
<p>This campaign is about establishing an independent University at Inyathi Mission in the region of Matabeleland North, Zimbabwe. Establishing this University in this underdeveloped region will:</p>
<p>1) Provide a university education for the young adults<br/></p>
<p>2) Catalyse investment and development in the region.<br/></p>
<p>3) Provide the region with the professionalism and expertise it so badly needs to develop.<br/></p>
<p>4) Provide our children in the region with the incentive to learn, not only to better themselves but also invest the  knowledge they acquire in the upliftment of the region and beyond.  <br/></p>
<p>5) Usher in a spirit of self empowerment and determination to achieve and attain their aspirations.</p>
<p>WHAT THE UNIVERSITY WILL OFFER:</p>
<p>1) Teaching Degrees (Primary and Secondary School).  It is intended that the University of Inyathi (UI) be the first to offer such degrees in Zimbabwe.

<div>Hi I'm Susan and I was brainwashed from an early age by my parents to believe that everyone has the power to make a positive difference in the world. </div>
<div>And I believed them. </div>
<div>I'm  the founder of the <b><a href=""http://dreambigmontessori.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dream Big Montessori School</a></b> in Tanzania, East Africa. I am also the proud and grateful mum of four magnificent children, thanks in large part to the influence of my kind, loving and spectacularly patient husband. </div>
<div>

<br/>
</div>
<div>Growing up in a small town on Northern Vancouver Island BC, I certainly never imagined that I would go to Africa, let alone build a school there, but in 2009, friends introduced me to this lake region of East Africa and I saw in person up close the harsh challenges many local Tanzanian children face, and I could not get some of these memories out of my mind...far too many children falling hard between the cracks...</div>
<div>- <i>dusty children darting between congested cars, frantically turning gasoline caps, being yelled at and shooed away, hoping to suck a mouthful of gasoline through a tube to run away with, spit out and sell for a few coins to buy food </i>
</div>
<div>- <i>exhausted children, in the dark, in concrete doorways, trying to sleep on old pieces of dirty cardboard, piled together like puppies, dreaming to be comforted and protected</i>
</div>
<div>- <i>exploited children,  far too young, hearing their personal stories of unthinkable abuse and abandonment, on their own, babies looking after babies, all around them adult intolerance, hostility and indifference</i>
</div>
<div>- <i>wasted children, wandering in the streets, nothing to do, nowhere to go, no school to attend and no dreams or prospects for their future</i>
</div>
<div>Returning home, I found it impossible to put these memories out of my mind despite the passage of time. For them complacency is an invisible and lethal enemy, and we can and should do far better by them. I felt compelled to act - not out of guilt or pity, but out of care and compassion for these children, and that I could find some way to make that positive difference. </div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Something <i>had to</i> be done...</span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">something tangible and empowering...something that could significantly raise the trajectory of these children's lives. The best answer had to be with access to quality education. In the words of Nelson Mandela, ""education is the most powerful weapon we have to create positive change in the world"".  </span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">So we built them a school...and the children came.</span></div>
<div>What started as a big hairy terrifying goal, with the dedication and hard work and remarkable generosity of many many amazing supporters and volunteers from different parts of the world, has become a remarkable magical place of learning in the idyllic, picturesque jungle 16km from Mwanza city on the shores of Lake Victoria - just a short drive to the gates of the Serengeti National Safari Reserve.</div>
<div>I chose the school name 'Dream Big' to inspire students and adults alike, and the words ""If you can dream it, you can do it!"" are clear and prominent in large letters at the main entrance to the classrooms. We are a Montessori methodology school, introducing here the new idea of the rights of the child, the child as a natural learner, and promoting the concept of self-reliance and independence - ""Help Me to Help Myself"".</div>

<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Having a school bus will make a tremendous difference for these young students and their families, especially those who have to walk long distances just to get to school. Furthermore, having a bus will make school a possibility for more children as a lack of transportation is a deal breaker for some families. And without school, these children invariably end up trapped in a dead end life of manual labour and illiteracy, working as housegirls or field workers, selling trinkets on the roadsides or worse. Access to education is the key to break this cycle and a school bus will get them there. </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Donate now</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> to get these kids on the road to education and opportunities! </span><br/>

</div><div>
<div><b>We need a school bus!</b></div> <p>We're so proud and thrilled to be beginning our third year of operation (Tanzanian school year runs from January - December)! Starting with our inaugural class of preschoolers in 2012/13 and adding a new class each year, we now have 3 classes of students from 3.5 to 7 years of age. As the students are promoted to the next grade, our intake is maxed out at 30 new wee ones annually, out of their minds excited to be able to go to school. </p>
<p>When we first started out with one class of 30 students, we were able to make do with one small school bus on temporary loan to us (see pic below), but it is unfortunately no longer available. A victim of our own success, our Montessori school is so popular that we are faced with a transportation crisis for our now tripled school population. Some of these young children are left with no option but to walk up to <b>2 hours</b> each direction every day to attend school and the rest struggle with badly, overcrowded hired cars - an expensive and unaffordable makeshift transportation solution. </p>

Hi I'm Susan and I was brainwashed from an early age by my parents to believe that everyone has the power to make a positive difference in the world. 
And I believed them. 
I'm  the founder of the Dream Big Montessori School in Tanzania, East Africa. I am also the proud and grateful mum of four magnificent children, thanks in large part to the influence of my kind, loving and spectacularly patient husband. 




Growing up in a small town on Northern Vancouver Island BC, I certainly never imagined that I would go to Africa, let alone build a school there, but in 2009, friends introduced me to this lake region of East Africa and I saw in person up close the harsh challenges many local Tanzanian children face, and I could not get some of these memories out of my mind...far too many children falling hard between the cracks...
- dusty children darting between congested cars, frantically turning gasoline caps, being yelled at and shooed away, hoping to suck a mouthful of gasoline through a tube to run away with, spit out and sell for a few coins to buy food 

- exhausted children, in the dark, in concrete doorways, trying to sleep on old pieces of dirty cardboard, piled together like puppies, dreaming to be comforted and protected

- exploited children,  far too young, hearing their personal stories of unthinkable abuse and abandonment, on their own, babies looking after babies, all around them adult intolerance, hostility and indifference

- wasted children, wandering in the streets, nothing to do, nowhere to go, no school to attend and no dreams or prospects for their future

Returning home, I found it impossible to put these memories out of my mind despite the passage of time. For them complacency is an invisible and lethal enemy, and we can and should do far better by them. I felt compelled to act - not out of guilt or pity, but out of care and compassion for these children, and that I could find some way to make that positive difference. 

Something had to be done...something tangible and empowering...something that could significantly raise the trajectory of these children's lives. The best answer had to be with access to quality education. In the words of Nelson Mandela, ""education is the most powerful weapon we have to create positive change in the world"".  

So we built them a school...and the children came.
What started as a big hairy terrifying goal, with the dedication and hard work and remarkable generosity of many many amazing supporters and volunteers from different parts of the world, has become a remarkable magical place of learning in the idyllic, picturesque jungle 16km from Mwanza city on the shores of Lake Victoria - just a short drive to the gates of the Serengeti National Safari Reserve.
I chose the school name 'Dream Big' to inspire students and adults alike, and the words ""If you can dream it, you can do it!"" are clear and prominent in large letters at the main entrance to the classrooms. We are a Montessori methodology school, introducing here the new idea of the rights of the child, the child as a natural learner, and promoting the concept of self-reliance and independence - ""Help Me to Help Myself"".





This is a remarkable grassroots initiative fuelled on goodwill, love and kindness - so in the spirit of our wonderful little school that has survived and thrived against all the odds - we reach out to the world to help now.
This is where you come in!
The goal of this campaign is to get an urgently needed used school bus and the Dream Big Montessori students need your support so get on the bus! 

Having a school bus will make a tremendous difference for these young students and their families, especially those who have to walk long distances just to get to school. Furthermore, having a bus will make school a possibility for more children as a lack of transportation is a deal breaker for some families. And without school, these children invariably end up trapped in a dead end life of manual labour and illiteracy, working as housegirls or field workers, selling trinkets on the roadsides or worse. Access to education is the key to break this cycle and a school bus will get them there. Donate now to get these kids on the road to education and opportunities! 


(And our bus will be exceptionally cool, the only one of its kind in the world, with a fabulous large scale decal collage of smiling faces all over it! Check out our uber cool perks for deets! You don't need to be a realtor to get your face on our bus. Even YOU can get your gorgeous mug (or your kid's or pet's) can be collaged with our student's faces to be part of our actual  bus decoration collage!!! - See Perks section for this and more fun and totally unique perks).
Donate now to help these kids back and forth to school, and get launched on this far better trajectory of life so they can dare to DREAM BIG!
What We Need & What You Get

We need a school bus! We're so proud and thrilled to be beginning our third year of operation (Tanzanian school year runs from January - December)! Starting with our inaugural class of preschoolers in 2012/13 and adding a new class each year, we now have 3 classes of students from 3.5 to 7 years of age. As the students are promoted to the next grade, our intake is maxed out at 30 new wee ones annually, out of their minds excited to be able to go to school. 
When we first started out with one class of 30 students, we were able to make do with one small school bus on temporary loan to us (see pic below), but it is unfortunately no longer available. A victim of our own success, our Montessori school is so popular that we are faced with a transportation crisis for our now tripled school population. Some of these young children are left with no option but to walk up to 2 hours each direction every day to attend school and the rest struggle with badly, overcrowded hired cars - an expensive and unaffordable makeshift transportation solution. 

Our amazing Superhero nun and on-the-ground school managing director, Sister Denise Mattle (Franciscan nun hailing from Switzerland), works tirelessly to keep our school running smoothly but pleads for the urgent need for a bus to take these children back and forth to school. 

Sister Denise with her local contacts has sourced a good quality second hand bus - capacity: 35 students - for the bargain nun price of  $30, 000 CAD. 
Funds Needed - Breakdown: 

Used bus: $26, 500 CAD 
Insurance, Gas & Driver: $3, 500 CAD/year

If we do not reach our entire goal, we will continue to raise funds until we get a bus for these kids. Also please don't be shy to continue donating if we surpass our goal, as our excess funds will go toward paying for the insurance, maintenance, gas and driver for future years. 

    Other Ways You Can Help Help spread the word of the School Bus Campaign! 
Share our campaign with your friends, family, on your website, your facebook page or even by old-fashioned word of mouth (still the best!). Remember, no amount is too small (donation levels start at $2)!
Every contribution you make will help bring these children one step closer to have decent transportation to and from school, making their education a reality!
We always welcome valuable input! If you have ideas about how to make our fabulous little school even better, please feel free to contact us at dreambigmontessori@gmail.com and don't forget to Follow and Like us on Facebook and Instagram!

<p>  We are the Aspire Higher Race team from Oxford Hills Middle School located in South Paris Maine. We are a group of 35 students, engaging in a hands on experiential learning program. At Oxford Hills Middle School, there are many different “Quests” you can do. This one just happened to be building and managing a race car from the ground up! We are the first Middle School in the country, and possibly even the whole world, doing this! This truly is a one of a kind experience for us. This experience really is important to us, because it gets us out from behind a desk. It gets us involved with our community and teaches us real word problem solving. By sitting behind a desk we don’t always learn the things we need to get us ready for the real world as adults. Through this program we are in the process of changing what it means to come to school! <br/></p>
<p>Oxford Hills Middle School has three trimester experiences: Humanities, STEM, and the Arts. Each experience is focused around different things. STEM is focused around Science Technology Engineering and Math, Humanities this year is focusing on War and Conflict, and the Arts teaches visual and performing arts. Every Thursday our school has ""Quest Day"" where students participate in different activities depending on which team they are on. Here are some examples:</p>
<p><b>The Arts:</b><br/></p>
<p> ~Costume Designing</p>
<p> ~Graphic Novel</p>
<p>~Culinary  <br/></p>
<p><b>Humanities:</b></p>
<p>~Weapons of Warfare<br/></p>
<p>~The Holocaust, Genocide and Human Rights</p>
<p>~Meeting Living Heroes to Preserve their Stories</p>
<p><b>STEM:</b></p>
<p><b> Eighth Grade:</b></p>
<p>~Making/Designing and Engineering mouse trap cars</p>
<p>~Engineering ""roller coasters""</p>
<p><b>Seventh Grade:</b></p>~Planning a trip to ""Mars""<br/><p><br/>As you can see, at Oxford Hills Middle School we are getting kids out from behind desks and creating hands-on learning for them! With these changes to our school, attendance rates have gone up and kids are more motivated to learn! The race car team isn't the only hands on learning going on at Oxford Hills Middle School!<br/></p>
<p>   We are looking to raise around $15,000 to help us with our program.  This money will go to the race car itself, which a team of seventh and eighth graders are in the process of building right now! Some money will also go toward the start-up cost of merchandise, which our graphic design team has been designing for us to sell! As you may know, before we can buy these things for the car and buy the merchandise we need some money so we can afford it and keep our program alive for future generations!  If we don’t reach our entire goal, we will still put it to good use. It will be dispersed through the building and engineering aspect of our program, and it will also be used to buy merchandise so we can sell at different races we will be racing in!<br/>   Our program is one of a kind! This program gets us ready for the real world when we get out of High School and College. This program helps us learn different aspects that adults need. For some of us, we know what we might want to go on to college for and make a living off of! Some want to be mechanics, secretaries, reporters, and those are just a few examples! There are many students working hard with this project, so far we have been on our local channels 8 (ABC) and 6 (NBC).  We were also mentioned on Nickelodeon News. We were also mentioned on Speed51, and our driver Spencer Morse has been interviewed multiple times, even on TV! Our program is teaching us real world situations.  On behalf of all 35 students, we would like you to know that this program has taught us more then we may ever learn in a classroom! We have learned speaking skills and mechanical skills, financial skills, and many other skills that we will need when we get out of college or high school!<br/>   The purpose of this fundraising campaign is to help us keep this program alive for years to come. Without your help, we may not be able to do this program in future generations! As of right now we are trying to expand this program into the high school so some of us can continue participating in this program! All of the students take great pride in this group, and we want to see it succeed.  we can’t do that without your help! We have already gotten sponsors but that's not all that we need! We need help from other generous people such as yourself! If someone you knew had this opportunity and they were in this program, wouldn’t you help them out? So what do you say? Any donation will help us out a lot! Anything you can spare will be greatly appreciated! <br/>Please spread the word and help us reach our goal! Use the Indiegogo share tools to get the word out! Our group would love to achieve our goal, and you could help make that possible! Please follow us on twitter, Facebook and check out our website!<br/></p>

<h2>Who We Are:</h2>
<p>Professor
Peaches is a proprietary tutoring program employing a range of techniques and
modalities, tailored to help children build and hone their verbal and nonverbal
(i.e., body language, eye contact, listening) abilities. The program is designed
with a holistic approach to speaking ability. The content has been carefully
created to build and develop a comprehensive array of communication-based
skills. The Professor Peaches “Power Wheel” illustrates the curriculum
components, which together work to form the heart of the program:<br/></p>

Peaches, we believe the most efficient and effective way to strengthen and refine communication abilities is through practice. Therefore, the
structure of each tutoring session is heavily based in experiential learning. Weekly homework assignments are designed to
reinforce and help ingrain the specific skills focused on in class. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">  </span>

have been designed to be fun and engaging in nature. All the key 
communication areas and themes have been allocated to a professor who is
 a subject matter expert and is featured throughout the program and in

All classes are taught by real staff who are highly qualified and 
trained and are carefully selected to ensure a perfect fit for children at Professor Peaches.<br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1027646/files/20141118185957-Kiddies_structure.png?1416365997"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""/><br/></p>Homework is completed with the assistance of set templates.

<p><span style=""font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 38px;"">Why This Needs to Exist:</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Society expects
people to be confident and engaging speakers despite the fact many individuals
never receive any training in this area. The lack of education focused on
communication skills presents a tremendous number of problems; from people
unable to express themselves to people actually being afraid to speak.
Comedian Jerry Seinfield perfectly highlights this dilemma in a joking
yet meaningful manner, ""According to most studies, people's number
one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. Death is number two. Does
that sound right? This means to the average person, if you go to a funeral,
you're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy."" This needs to be
changed. Communication skills are vital. The ability to communicate well should
not be viewed as the frosting on the cake. It should be viewed as the cake
itself! And at the end of the day, well, who doesn’t like cake?  Below are
some additional quotes that illustrate the power and importance of
communication:<br/></p>

<h2>Our expansion plan:</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The Professor
Peaches curriculum has been optimized and refined after undergoing beta testing
and is now ready to begin making an impact! The next steps are to open the
very first location and implement our detailed expansion plan to facilitate
the presence of Professor Peaches globally. There are approximately 2 billion
children in the world. Our dream is to help reach these children so that they
are given the skills to communicate well. To express themselves. To believe in
themselves. To have confidence in themselves. To make the world theirs!</p>

have been designed to be fun and engaging in nature. All the key 
communication areas and themes have been allocated to a professor who is
 a subject matter expert and is featured throughout the program and in 
homework assignments. The faculty serve to create a playful structure. 
All classes are taught by real staff who are highly qualified and 
trained and are carefully selected to ensure a perfect fit for children at Professor Peaches.Homework is completed with the assistance of set templates. Two examples of homework assignments are provided below:


Why This Needs to Exist:

Society expects
people to be confident and engaging speakers despite the fact many individuals
never receive any training in this area. The lack of education focused on
communication skills presents a tremendous number of problems; from people
unable to express themselves to people actually being afraid to speak.
Comedian Jerry Seinfield perfectly highlights this dilemma in a joking
yet meaningful manner, ""According to most studies, people's number
one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. Death is number two. Does
that sound right? This means to the average person, if you go to a funeral,
you're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy."" This needs to be
changed. Communication skills are vital. The ability to communicate well should
not be viewed as the frosting on the cake. It should be viewed as the cake
itself! And at the end of the day, well, who doesn’t like cake?  Below are
some additional quotes that illustrate the power and importance of
communication:



Our expansion plan:

The Professor
Peaches curriculum has been optimized and refined after undergoing beta testing
and is now ready to begin making an impact! The next steps are to open the
very first location and implement our detailed expansion plan to facilitate
the presence of Professor Peaches globally. There are approximately 2 billion
children in the world. Our dream is to help reach these children so that they
are given the skills to communicate well. To express themselves. To believe in
themselves. To have confidence in themselves. To make the world theirs!
Please visit our website at www.professorpeaches.com to have a closer look at us.





What We Need:

Our goal for
2015 is to open the inaugural Professor Peaches Center; we have selected Chicago for the launch city, and specifically the Skokie/Evanston area. In order to open
the doors of the first Professor Peaches Center we need your help to make the components of opening a center come together such as:    

Securing a lease for the first Professor Peaches Center
Configuring the Center into a stimulating and engaging learning space
Printing and publication of program materials
Purchasing children's enrollment package supplies
Marketing and promotion of Professor Peaches

In addition, we are excited to announce that part of your donation will go toward securing cost-free tuition for children who qualify. Thank you in advance for your generosity. Every dollar raised by this campaign will go towards the aforementioned necessities.

<p>We (Darbee and Grisel) are Masters candidates in the religious studies department at Florida International University in Miami which is where we met and first began talking about the religion and politics of Myanmar-Burma. We were both very interested in Buddhism, feminism, and religious violence; Burma was an obvious choice for the research that is the basis for each of our thesis projects.

<p>In Burma, Buddhist nuns do not reap the benefits that come with full ordination (like the monks do) because they are not allowed to be fully ordained. Nuns in Burma are referred to as ""thila-shins,"" meaning ""one who practices the teachings dharma,"" and it is as far as they can climb in the spiritual ladder of Buddhism. This alone is noteworthy, but what is even more curious, is the fully ordained status of the nationalist monks who are part of the 969 movement. Their leader, who Time magazine called ""the Buddhist Bin Laden,"" uses Buddhist teachings and the exploitation of Burmese women to justify the sometimes violent actions of their organization.<br/></p>
<p>In order to complete our Masters Thesis and thus graduate, we need to travel to Myanmar-Burma to engage with these women who seldom have a voice outside the confinement of their own country.

<p>3. We figure we'll each need about 500 dollars for food</p>
<p>4. And we've factored in another 500 for miscellaneous/emergencies/donations to the nunnery.<br/></p>
<p>This puts us up to a grand total of $5,875.00! We've each already raised $1,200.00 which puts us up to $2,400.00. We're hoping to raise the remaining $3,385.00 before we leave in June. If we don't reach our entire goal, we will have to get creative, but both of us intend to use whatever we raise towards our trip.

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> For a long time, the political climate in Myanmar has made its people reluctant to answer questions about the government, and the monastic community is no exception. Monks and nuns are discouraged from getting involved in political affairs (affairs like full ordination for women and the perspective on the 969). However, we have been preparing for this for months, and are more than prepared to use our expertise in the field of ethnography to gain the trust of our informants and respondents. Because we plan on being there well over a month, we hope to build lasting and trusting relationships with the nuns in order to fully unearth what it means to be a Buddhist woman in Myanmar-Burma. <br/><br/>On top of the difficulty of extracting delicate information, the pressure of having to gather usable data for the most important document we will have to write in our academic career thus far, and being away from those we love in a strange place; we also run the risk of going for extended amounts of time without many western luxuries we are used to! Regular internet connection, access to plumbing and showers, and comfortable beds may be foreign to us during our time in Southeast Asia. These risks are small compared to what we believe we can accomplish if we complete this research. These calculated risks seem small compared to the idea that we get to help the women of Myanmar-Burma and promote gender equality and peace across the globe. <br/><ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Any little bit helps, even the smallest donation can help us reach our goal!

Monks and nuns are discouraged from getting involved in political affairs (affairs like full ordination for women and the perspective on the 969). However, we have been preparing for this for months, and are more than prepared to use our expertise in the field of ethnography to gain the trust of our informants and respondents. Because we plan on being there well over a month, we hope to build lasting and trusting relationships with the nuns in order to fully unearth what it means to be a Buddhist woman in Myanmar-Burma. On top of the difficulty of extracting delicate information, the pressure of having to gather usable data for the most important document we will have to write in our academic career thus far, and being away from those we love in a strange place; we also run the risk of going for extended amounts of time without many western luxuries we are used to! Regular internet connection, access to plumbing and showers, and comfortable beds may be foreign to us during our time in Southeast Asia. These risks are small compared to what we believe we can accomplish if we complete this research. These calculated risks seem small compared to the idea that we get to help the women of Myanmar-Burma and promote gender equality and peace across the globe.     Other Ways You Can HelpAny little bit helps, even the smallest donation can help us reach our goal! But we understand financial situations and if you're not in one to donate, fear not!

To put up two indoor and four outdoor stands: our stands right now are few and far between - and not very noticeable. Putting up new stands will help us as a publication stand out on campus.

<b>Kids Riding Bikes by Nine13 Sports NW</b><br/>
</h3>
<div>
<p>Nine13 Sports NW delivers educational programming promoting health, wellness and exercise to youth in the Northwest. Kids Riding Bikes is a youth program that promotes an active lifestyle through the sport of cycling. We integrate the traditional bicycle with technology to introduce cycling as a fun physical activity that has lifelong benefits for both the individual and community.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>How it works...</h3>
<p>Single-speed bikes are connected to a computer simulator. Electronic stands control resistance, making it easier or more difficult to pedal. For example, resistance increases when simulating riding uphill. Students track their progress—distance, time, speed, cadence and watts of energy generated—on a big-screen monitor, trying to improve their results over the course of the multi-week program. </p>
<p>This program is held at existing youth institutions, such as elementary and middle schools, and is integrated into the normal school day. The program is designed to get participants on the bikes and moving, having fun in the process. Instructors guide participants through a series of workouts with varying terrain to provide students with a real experience. Since the program can be held indoors, we can deliver programming year-round.</p>
<p>Kids Riding Bikes started in Central Indiana and in 2014, impacted 20,000 youth.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
</div><div>
<h3>How your contribution helps...</h3> <p>The goal of Nine13 Sports NW is to provide the Kids Riding Bikes program without any costs to participating schools.  Funds raised during this campaign will go to covering the costs of getting the project off the ground which includes equipment (bikes, trainers, computers, transportation, signage) and costs associated with delivering the program to schools.  </p>
<p>As of March 30th, there are already two Portland schools scheduled to host Kids Riding Bikes in May, and we are already planning programs in the 2015-16 school year. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why this program matters...</h3> <p>Over the course of the next five years, our goal is to impact 80,000 community kids through this program. The equipment purchased through this campaign will be used to deliver the message of living an active lifestyle through cycling for years to come. Your contribution will help us promote health, wellness and exercise as we strive to combat childhood obesity and get kids moving on bicycles.</p>
<p>Portland has a vibrant cycling community with organizations that play important roles: providing safe routes to school (BTA), offering discounted or free bikes and helmets (Community Cycling Center) and promoting youth racing .  We are currently working with all these excellent non-profits. However, there is no organization in the area that provides that first step: working within the school system to put kids on bikes while providing a fun, interactive experience, no matter their prior experience with riding.  Kids Riding Bikes can play a crucial role in the larger cycling community, while promoting the overall mission to reduce childhood obesity.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents in the past 30 years. In 2012, more than one third of children were overweight or obese. Kids need to get moving. Kids Riding Bikes is a program designed to incorporate active movement and game play through computerized trainers. Nine13 Sports NW needs your help getting the necessary funding to start delivering the program to the Portland and Vancouver area.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Donate equipment!  Do you have a laptop or 50-60"" monitor that we can use for our programming?  Want to help organize a fundraising event?

I am Sanda, I'm burmese and one of the co-founders of BurmeseHearts.com . We aim to help learners and instructors connect around
a range of subjects, from alphabet for kids to adult courses. 
Myanmar may have many problems to solve and I
believe that having a platform for skill-based and lifelong learning, where any
content expert can be an instructor, including individuals, companies,
publishers ,universities is solving a real problem. 
The problem of highly unskilled workforce is not a
surprise considering Myanmar was a closed country for decades. Currently there
is not enough skilled employees in many fields in Myanmar as more and more
international companies choose to set up operations there.



From BurmeseHearts.com , people can learn to build better relationship in
family and society and to become part of a modern and increasingly more
technical workforce. In our educational platform, we allow instructors to
market, share and monetize their content and engage with new learners. With
3500 learners (as of 26 Dec) logging and 700K page views during 
six-month, we today have 460 lessons for Myanmar people who want to learn
a new skill.
We do help Myanmar people with our learning
platform and our own budget. But our reach is limited to reach more Myanmar
people with our little budget. We want to increase our support for those
without education/skill in their neighborhoods and also make it easier for
learners and instructors to message each other, to chat and share course
materials and content.
There is no such e-learning platform for Burmese
speaking where they can learn outside
the university / school system with emphasize on individual
self-paced lessons, book offline
classes/workshops third parties , find online educational growing community (chat/social

of world´s history in order to show the impact on our society. Almost everybody
finds this interesting and useful, but there is a more serious challenge

  We
have identified three main issues concerning different areas that are going to
influence our future directly: technology, Syria and China. For each area we
are approaching different experts on these topics so that they can give us their opinion about that will, in some extend, directly determine the flow of history.

Technology:
Technology nowadays is everywhere, it´s everything, and it is responsible for the development of our time. Recently, we are experiencing a global exponential growth,
both in terms of economic  and social development.
Technology is changing the way we behave. Our lives are so influenced by
different devices, such as telephones or PCs,  that we are not able to get rid of  them, they are practically part of us. For this reason, we believe
there are some questions concerning technology that should be approached so as
to make people conscious of the possible future technological revolutions that may occur.

                              



Syria: Although this seems to be an actual conflict, the problems emerging from it
are going to have effects for longer that we can imagine. What is going to happen with the millions of
people escaping from the Middle East and searching for asylum in Europe? How is the armed racial conflict in Syria going to end? It si clear that many of these questionsremain unresolved and because of this, we would like to address
the Syrian conflict as one of the most important factors regarding our future
situation in 2021.



   


China: The first world economic power (in terms of PPP GDP) is growing nowadays at
incredible speed. Apparently, the Asian giant is trying to liberalize its
economy. Currently, we can observe how this country is opening more to the global markets and therefore, developing a more
liberal economy both within the country and the rest of the world. But it seems

over 200,000 people in 2014 (source: wikipedia).  It is a sacred road, 800 kilometers of asking questions and receiving answers.  Everyone comes with different questions, different quests, different needs...but, step by step, everyone discovers, uncovers something.  For many, including me, the message of the Camino is remember the joy of existence, the passion of daily living, and the love that surrounds you!  And we do - we put down our pain, our suffering, our stories, and we listen to the wisdom inside, the little voice telling us how to Serve the Whole, how to Live our Soul's Purpose.  And then we take what we've learned back to where we live, in resolution to share what we've learned with our friends, our families, our communities...the healing and inspiration we find on the Camino ripples outward, affecting everything and everyone we touch.  We become better versions of ourselves and we change the world by our expansion, through the collective consciousness and through our direct actions.  Thus, all benefit, and we begin to create something new.</span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This is a major access point for seekers, people searching for answers about how to live better lives, how to create better communities.  It's a road that attracts people looking for Love, to Give and Receive, to Choose Life.  So why not offer tools to the people who are taking action to change?  Why not share what we know about healing so that they can learn new skills and share them?  <i>Why not?</i></span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">A major theme of this road, of this life and of the School is learning how to nurture ourselves: how to raise ourselves and, in turn, give our children examples of lives lived through conscious creation.  But we cannot give our children what we do not have.  We cannot teach our children what we do not know.  And we cannot nurture those who are coming if we cannot nurture those who are already here.</span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Imagine if each one of us knew how to nurture ourselves and each other, creating communities of individuals dedicated to lovingly developing each other's infinite potential. Imagine that the goal of every thought, word and action was to nurture the inherent love and goodness within...and see it reflected without.  Imagine that every single relationship you have - with yourself, with other beings, with the Earth herself - was founded in this ideal of loving nurturing.  Imagine if we were all loving, dedicated parents to each other.  What would this world become?  <i>How would it feel? </i> </span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Just imagine...8 billion people nurturing each other...</span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">CHOOSE LIFE, DREAM BIG, and CALL A FRIEND - WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER!</span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></h3><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The ultimate and most basic risk is that we will build the School and no one will be interested in the opportunities that we have to offer.  Nothing could come of this project and we could fail completely in our objectives.  We risk this every time we make a decision, every single time we decide to do anything.  It's a reality of this dimensional experience.  So.  There's that.</span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We will face challenges, for certain, and some of them will knock us down, while others will provide the rocky terrain that guides our feet higher up the mountain.  But we will not fail because we understand the power of the law of attraction and know how to allow connection, communication and communion.  We will not fail to expand the Love flowing through us.</span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">In this moment, these are the foreseen challenges and risks:</span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Although I often refer to ""we"" in expectation of the team that will develop around this project, and in inclusion of everyone sending energy to this campaign, at this stage, I am working mostly alone.  (Albeit with an excellent support system.)  Allowing a team to coalesce organically, as the project develops, creates several challenges: patience; attracting the group of bright souls who desire to co-create something wonderful; practicing and teaching how to work in a heterarchy rather than a hierarchy; and working collaboratively with our strengths and weaknesses when we find each other.</span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I don't know who will come to co-create the School; I do know that I will do the work to get it started, with whatever help appears, to build the foundations of Phases One and Two.  To launch these phases requires a lot of work, and it is the first time I've co-ordinated a project on this scale...but I plan to take it step by step, working with the principles of SMART project management, accountability deadlines, my community of support, and prioritizing self-care so that I can keep giving my best.  These things I know how to do, and I know how to ask for help when I need it.  Ask and ye shall receive.  Fortunately, I've worked with many people on their projects, ranging from expanding a large donativo wellness center to assisting the creation of a traveling artisan workshop to starting a vegetarian restaurant, and have learned much from their successes and challenges.  And I have mentors who can guide me.</span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Other challenges include the technological aspects of Phase One and the fact that I do not yet speak fluent Spanish.  I have not yet learned how to run or update a website and, while I have made many meditation videos and taught many classes, I lack experience in creating professional quality audio-visual offerings.  But I am seeking help in creating these videos and whomever designs and builds the website will also teach me how to keep it current.  And I have at least one translator ready and excited to be a part of this project, as I continue to develop my language skills.</span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Knowing my skills and strengths gives me confidence that I can spark the development of the School and, with help, face all risks and create solutions for all challenges along the way.  I am courageous, devoted, dedicated, creative, attentive to detail, and...persistent.  I've demonstrated and strengthened these qualities throughout the past decade: graduating summa cum laude from college and earning a law degree; walking away from this conventional path and the expectations of others to find my own way; keeping a cool head during violence; starting over after trauma; healing, step by step; training as an energy healer; giving up the familiar, packing a backpack, and setting off to learn and teach energy healing techniques on four continents...all in the name of Service.  In the past few years, I've used my skills in communication and connection to develop a healing practice, start a successful jewelry business, write a training manual for healing techniques, and develop and teach workshops and retreats.  And after my daily morning meditation and yoga, I channel energy and create throughout the day - my voice, my pen and my hands speak for themselves, tales of wonder and beauty.  </span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Please join me.  Together, with our strengths and skills, we can face any challenge.  Together, we can offer the tools of healing to the world.  <i>Together, we can create a new reality.</i></span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></h3><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">First and foremost, please remember this project in your thoughts and prayers - smile and send whatever blessing you can, whenever you think of us.  This will help us more than anything else, the accumulated and directed Love that will sustain us and attract the energies we need.  The power of prayer and consciously directed intention is unparalleled (if you're curious about the science, read more here).</span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Money is only one energy in this great spectrum on consciousness - we seek diverse frequencies for this project!  If you can give the energy of your time, your prayers, your love, your expertise, please do - we need you.</span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">If you have any interest in building with us, we seek people who want to:</span></h3><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></h3><h3><ol>

and on a quest to find my true path.Healing became my passion, my focus.  Having little success with mainstream medicine, I turned to holistic alternatives.  Over the next five years, I studied many different modalities, working with acupuncture, massage, emotional freedom technique, shamanic practices, Reiki, yoga, and many more.  Eventually, I became a Reiki Master Teacher and began to teach others how to channel energy for healing.  I learned and taught healing techniques in the United States, Costa Rica, Morocco, Italy, and India before I came to the Camino.  It was here, while walking the Way, that I found the courage to being to realize my dream: sharing what I've learned with as many people as possible by building a school.The School: It will start as a virtual school offering remembrance tools to pilgrims on the Camino.  Of course, the Camino is a metaphor for life - the offerings will benefit anyone walking any path.  That said, the initial offerings are designed with the pilgrimage in mind: to support the healing journey, to help integrate the lessons learned while walking, and to provide guidance for manifesting dreams and projects in the next phase of the journey.  As we grow, the curriculum will deepen and provide opportunities for in-person classes, workshops, residential retreats and other types of learning exchanges.  Ultimately, the School will offer a full curriculum of opportunities to develop the skills necessary to raise ourselves and our conscious children to live joyful lives of passion and purpose.Now, I admit -

$200 Creative collaboration: photo/videography - $500Translation costs: $500Phase Two:  Sharing the Offering and Continuing EducationTimeline - April 2016 through October 2016This phase includes sharing the School's initial offerings, in person and online, and expanding the offerings through training and learning exchanges.  It's important to share these skills with as many people as possible, with the intention that those who learn the skills will apply them in their lives and model them to others, creating constantly expanding ripples of change.  Planned visibility points include Facebook, Google, online Camino forums and in person connections.  My current intention is to walk (and possibly ride a colorful bike) on the Camino again, teaching the offerings in person along the Way (in the albergues, the bars, wherever it happens) and sharing the website with words and tangible reminders, such as drawings, stickers and ""graffiti.""  Using the principles of street art activism, we'll share the message in ways that do not deface any vista by using non-toxic, temporary and sustainable papers, inks and glues.A major part of this phase is accumulating responses to the Kits and responding to and integrating the needs and suggestions offered.  And, as I continue teach the skills along the way, I'll record the feedback provided by pilgrims and use it to expand and refine the offerings of the Kits.  There will be a feedback component of the Kits, a request for input on the website, plus the information coming from my continuing correspondence with people whom I have met while walking and living on the Camino.Another aspect of this phase is deepening my own skill set for offering and teaching healing tools by attending and completing a formal yoga teacher training.  Thus far, my practice and teaching of yoga and meditation have grown out of my own intensive personal study.  With a formal training, I will have the guidance to take this study even deeper, so as to be able to develop a greater intimacy with the techniques and a more comprehensive understanding of how and why they work.  I'll be able to design and offer more effective and expansive healing opportunities, which will help grow my offering to the School in Phase Three.  Additionally, obtaining an official certificate will enable me to obtain insurance and facilitate the practical aspects of offering courses, workshops and residential retreats.  My heart sings with the practice and teaching of kundalini yoga, in the lineage of Yogi Bhajan; more about kundalini yoga and the teacher training I have chosen can be discovered at these websites: www.3HO.org, www.cherdikala.eu .Part of this training and developing new offerings includes holding practice courses and retreats,  in order to gain further experience and feedback.  These practicums will be open to those who participate in the campaign (another perk!) and anyone who wishes to give their heart energy to expand the School and what we can offer.  This is the phase in which new teachers and healing modalities are expressly sought, with the intention to build the School community and seed growth from common intention and diverse experience.  Experiments in material presented, ways of collaborating and new wholeness techniques are sought and encouraged.  We can create something amazing! Projected budget for Phase Two: $4500Sharing: online advertising, tangible items (cards, stickers, etc), distribution along the Camino - $500Kundalini yoga teacher training: $3000Costs for practice workshops and retreats: $1000Phase Three: Expansion and Offering of the School's CurriculumTimeline - November 2016 through November 2017This is the phase of applying the learning and connections from Phase Two so as to develop an expanded curriculum.  This is the phase of collaboration with new partners, of dreaming, of growth, and of creating tangible ways to offer skills for expansion.  My vision for my offering includes creating offering courses, workshops and trainings such as Energy Healing: Foundations and Techniques (an extension of what I already teach when people approach me for Reiki training), Dream Manifestation: Conscious Creation, Sexuality & Creativity: Empowerment, Tools for Allowing Grief, and Tools for Healing Sexual Wounding.  The intention is for others to develop and offer curricula on nutrition, holistic and traditional healing, plant medicine, permaculture and sustainable living techniques, energetic architecture, art therapy, dance, music, human design, tantra, storytelling, writing...the dream is BIG.  If you feel the call, COME!This is also the phase of creating a formal foundational structure that can serve as an interface for official communication and licensing, ie addressing the ""real world"" concerns of taxes, insurance, visas and the like.  Currently, it is my idea to create an entity based on the model provided by the Alternate Roots organization in the United States, in which all members of the organization take responsibility.  Although I am familiar with their organization and admire the ways in which they operate, I lack experience in setting up an organization with legal standing and would very much appreciate advice and help in this regard.  If you have any expertise or advice, please help us.As of this writing, and until the formal structure of the School is created, it is likely that I will bear individual responsibility for the taxes and any legal costs incurred from this campaign and during the first two phases.  With this reality in mind, I've included these projected costs (and anything unforeseen, as the unexpected is expected) in the budget.Projected budget for Phase Three: $1500Taxes, fees, organization costs, unexpected expenses - $1500Projected budget for Phases One through Three: $10,000 **Each of these costs can be mitigated by the donation of goods and services - the more hearts involved, the better!  This is a community project.**Timeline - now through November 2017The ImpactPeople come from all over the world to walk the Camino de Santiago - over 200,000 people in 2014 (source: wikipedia).  It is a sacred road, 800 kilometers of asking questions and receiving answers.  Everyone comes with different questions, different quests, different needs...but, step by step, everyone discovers, uncovers something.  For many, including me, the message of the Camino is remember the joy of existence, the passion of daily living, and the love that surrounds you!  And we do - we put down our pain, our suffering, our stories, and we listen to the wisdom inside, the little voice telling us how to Serve the Whole, how to Live our Soul's Purpose.  And then we take what we've learned back to where we live, in resolution to share what we've learned with our friends, our families, our communities...the healing and inspiration we find on the Camino ripples outward, affecting everything and everyone we touch.  We become better versions of ourselves and we change the world by our expansion, through the collective consciousness and through our direct actions.  Thus, all benefit, and we begin to create something new.This is a major access point for seekers, people searching for answers about how to live better lives, how to create better communities.  It's a road that attracts people looking for Love, to Give and Receive, to Choose Life.  So why not offer tools to the people who are taking action to change?  Why not share what we know about healing so that they can learn new skills and share them?  Why not?A major theme of this road, of this life and of the School is learning how to nurture ourselves: how to raise ourselves and, in turn, give our children examples of lives lived through conscious creation.  But we cannot give our children what we do not have.  We cannot teach our children what we do not know.  And we cannot nurture those who are coming if we cannot nurture those who are already here.Imagine if each one of us knew how to nurture ourselves and each other, creating communities of individuals dedicated to lovingly developing each other's infinite potential. Imagine that the goal of every thought, word and action was to nurture the inherent love and goodness within...and see it reflected without.  Imagine that every single relationship you have - with yourself, with other beings, with the Earth herself - was founded in this ideal of loving nurturing.  Imagine if we were all loving, dedicated parents to each other.  What would this world become?  How would it feel?  Just imagine...8 billion people nurturing each other...CHOOSE LIFE, DREAM BIG, and CALL A FRIEND - WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER!Risks & ChallengesThe ultimate and most basic risk is that we will build the School and no one will be interested in the opportunities that we have to offer.  Nothing could come of this project and we could fail completely in our objectives.  We risk this every time we make a decision, every single time we decide to do anything.  It's a reality of this dimensional experience.  So.  There's that.We will face challenges, for certain, and some of them will knock us down, while others will provide the rocky terrain that guides our feet higher up the mountain.  But we will not fail because we understand the power of the law of attraction and know how to allow connection, communication and communion.  We will not fail to expand the Love flowing through us.In this moment, these are the foreseen challenges and risks:Although I often refer to ""we"" in expectation of the team that will develop around this project, and in inclusion of everyone sending energy to this campaign, at this stage, I am working mostly alone.  (Albeit with an excellent support system.)  Allowing a team to coalesce organically, as the project develops, creates several challenges: patience; attracting the group of bright souls who desire to co-create something wonderful; practicing and teaching how to work in a heterarchy rather than a hierarchy; and working collaboratively with our strengths and weaknesses when we find each other.I don't know who will come to co-create the School; I do know that I will do the work to get it started, with whatever help appears, to build the foundations of Phases One and Two.  To launch these phases requires a lot of work, and it is the first time I've co-ordinated a project on this scale...but I plan to take it step by step, working with the principles of SMART project management, accountability deadlines, my community of support, and prioritizing self-care so that I can keep giving my best.  These things I know how to do, and I know how to ask for help when I need it.  Ask and ye shall receive.  Fortunately, I've worked with many people on their projects, ranging from expanding a large donativo wellness center to assisting the creation of a traveling artisan workshop to starting a vegetarian restaurant, and have learned much from their successes and challenges.  And I have mentors who can guide me.Other challenges include the technological aspects of Phase One and the fact that I do not yet speak fluent Spanish.  I have not yet learned how to run or update a website and, while I have made many meditation videos and taught many classes, I lack experience in creating professional quality audio-visual offerings.  But I am seeking help in creating these videos and whomever designs and builds the website will also teach me how to keep it current.  And I have at least one translator ready and excited to be a part of this project, as I continue to develop my language skills.Knowing my skills and strengths gives me confidence that I can spark the development of the School and, with help, face all risks and create solutions for all challenges along the way.  I am courageous, devoted, dedicated, creative, attentive to detail, and...persistent.  I've demonstrated and strengthened these qualities throughout the past decade: graduating summa cum laude from college and earning a law degree; walking away from this conventional path and the expectations of others to find my own way; keeping a cool head during violence; starting over after trauma; healing, step by step; training as an energy healer; giving up the familiar, packing a backpack, and setting off to learn and teach energy healing techniques on four continents...all in the name of Service.  In the past few years, I've used my skills in communication and connection to develop a healing practice, start a successful jewelry business, write a training manual for healing techniques, and develop and teach workshops and retreats.  And after my daily morning meditation and yoga, I channel energy and create throughout the day - my voice, my pen and my hands speak for themselves, tales of wonder and beauty.  Please join me.  Together, with our strengths and skills, we can face any challenge.  Together, we can offer the tools of healing to the world.  Together, we can create a new reality.Other Ways You Can HelpFirst and foremost, please remember this project in your thoughts and prayers - smile and send whatever blessing you can, whenever you think of us.  This will help us more than anything else, the accumulated and directed Love that will sustain us and attract the energies we need.  The power of prayer and consciously directed intention is unparalleled (if you're curious about the science, read more here).Money is only one energy in this great spectrum on consciousness - we seek diverse frequencies for this project!  If you can give the energy of your time, your prayers, your love, your expertise, please do - we need you.If you have any interest in building with us, we seek people who want to:

design and build a website

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">My name is Abraham Jarquin, I am 29

to Guatemala in 80's because a civil war. During their initial years in
Guatemala they struggled as immigrants trying to find jobs to support them and
their only child. Eventually they passed very difficult and critical moments
and established themselves with a good home, economy, and jobs.  With a better quality of life, they were able
to pay for my elementary and high school education. Eventually I was able to

have been working for a Non-Government Organization (NGO) in different states within

natural resource management.  As the
result of my work people are given the opportunity to become self-sufficient by
growing food for their families, to advance themselves with more education, and
to become economically independent through business education and
entrepreneurship. Almost 90% of the people I’ve helped are families with an
average of 5-8 children, who live on less than $ 1 per day, and suffer from
chronic malnutrition.  The past years
with these different projects have been very rewarding to watch these people learn

<p><br/></p>Greetings, my name is Nancy Goodwin, the lead teacher for Sinfonietta Strings. I have been teaching violin for over 25 years and performing violin professionally for 30. I
am pleased to present the Sinfonietta Strings Program of Greater Nashua here in New Hampshire.<span>   This is a United Way program that teaches
violin and viola weekly to students in the Nashua public schools and offers an

complements existing school band programs and enhances the regular classroom
program, teaching children to focus while learning how to read music and play
an instrument.  We offer group lessons in three of the twelve elementary schools in
Nashua.  Once a week, 45 students
take 30 minute lessons on violin or viola in groups of 3 students each.  After school the string ensemble for older
and more advanced players currently enrolls 35 students from the Greater Nashua area. Students learn music and they learn how to work as a team.<br/><br/><p>40% of Sinfonietta
Strings students are on a free or reduced lunch program.  One of the schools is a Title 1 school and every

assistance and scholarship assistance are given to students who are on free or
discounted lunch programs.</p>
<p>Sinfonietta
Strings was designed from the outset to require no school district funds since
even critical programs are and will continue to be cut. Having established Sinfonietta Strings in
three of the elementary schools we wish to add another Title 1 school by September
2016.  We need to raise $4,500 for each Title 1 school we teach in and $3,000 for non-Title 1 schools. We would like to continue the program in one of the three Middle Schools. In the after school string ensemble, we would like to enroll more
students not able to afford tuition. 
Importantly we do not want the cost for the tuition paying parents to
become unreasonably high in order to subsidize the 40% in need of
scholarship. <br/></p>

<p>
<br/>
</p><p>
Values</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p><p>
In
carrying out its role, the Mi.Ca. Foundation will be guided by the
following values:</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p><p>
Integrity</p>
<p>
Dedication</p>
<p>
Confidence</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p><p><b>Promote
the improvement of health conditions and the social and economic
progress of Mozambique.</b></p>
<p>
From
an economic perspective, Mozambique has been defined by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) as one of the most dynamic
economies in sub-Saharan Africa, the rate of GDP growth is around to'
8%. Exports increased from $ 360 million in 2000 to a peak of 1 115
billion in 2013. It is expected to continue growing.</p>
<p>
Despite
the positive data on growth rates, mainly linked to the sector of raw
materials, it must be stated that the wealth is poorly distributed,
54% of the population lives below the poverty line, the agricultural
sector still accounts for the existence 80% of the workforce and
infrastructure and health and education systems are still
inefficient.</p>
<p>
To
allow Mozambique to benefit more revenue from the exploitation of its
resources, the project Mi.Ca. Foundation will engage in the
construction of a communication network air and ground, in the
training of local staff and in other projects aimed at improving the
education system and the country's health, the raising of the
subsistence level and the development of small and medium enterprises
.</p>
<p>
The
first essential step is to implement a network of air and land
transport, in order to ensure an emergency service, named ""Flying
Doctors"", which will help the inhabitants of remote or
disadvantaged areas, not easily accessible by other means of
transport; but that will also allow a timely intervention in the most
serious and urgent cases, administering first aid and assistance.</p>
<p>
The
second step will be to facilitate trade in goods between local
suppliers and final users (local and foreign), so as to promote the
growth and development of local small and medium enterprises
(craftsmen, fishermen, farmers, small producers) and to facilitate
and improve the availability of goods, services and labor, both for
the leisure sector (hospitality / catering) for manufacturing
companies and service sectors.</p>
<p>
The
transport service would also undertake the delivery of the
correspondence between the coast and inland.</p>
<p>
The
potential of creating satellite activities ahich increase and better
not only the economic but also the hygienic / sanitary conditions and
cultural needs of local populations, is huge.</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p><p>
It
must be considered that many of the developments of international air
transport of big airlines, will inevitably affect the development of
the territory. Just think, for example, that large companies use, as
a criterion in its strategic business decisions, an unpredictable and
rapidly changing market forces and variables of profit, rather than
adopt the considerations on social and territorial variables.</p>
<p>
Our
program Mi.Ca. Foundation, brings together air transport with other
transport routes (land and sea), and communications.</p>
<p>
We
expect continued efforts to strengthen transport and logistics
facilities, at local level, with particular attention to
environmental protection, safety and innovative transport solutions,
efficient in terms of energy and cost; we refer also to possible
problems of ""quarantine"".</p>
<p>
As
for environmental protection, it is unlikely that the main
environmental problem associated with air travel, that is, the noise
and engine emissions, would be relevant (unlike the large commercial
aircraft and passengers) in the context of small ultralight or
caravel, because of their payload, range and the small stream. But
above all for the use of natural airstrip (airstrips in clay, with
low environmental impact).</p>
<p>
Consider,
on the other hand, the enormous and significant effect of the
construction of large airports (such as loss of open space and soil
erosion; the impact on the water and on the fields of drainage, etc,
not to mention of flora and fauna, especially in coastal areas).</p>
<p>
As
for the aspects of quarantine, we adopt measures (as defined by WHO)
to prevent the spread of epidemics, especially malaria or yellow
fever, potentially carried by vectors. We proceed further with
regular pest control means, to ensure that the target is reached.</p>
<p>
That
is why we need immediate support for the start-up of this challenging
task that takes time, diplomacy and constant dedication.</p>
<p>
We
need funds to start the business of air transport, with its licenses
and concessions for both governmental activity itself and for the
construction of the airstrips; funds for the construction of
structures for initial reception of patients; logistics facilities
for sorting and temporary storage of goods and correspondence; rental
of premises for training / updating of personnel.</p>

<p>Since we started the Climb Again project, we managed to

the world around has in relation to them.</p>

Climb Again până azi

Din 2013 am reușit, prin muncă voluntară și mici finanțări, să aducem la cursuri gratuite de escaladă peste 100 de copii cu deficiențe de vedere și auz, 40 de copii cu autism și în jur de 50 de tineri cu alte tipuri de dizabilități. 
Am organizat probe demonstrative sau competitive la majoritatea concursurilor din calendarul competițional al Federației Române de Alpinism și Escaladă, am fost în excursii la munte și am încercat să îi scoatem cât mai des la activități în afara internatului în care își petrec majoritatea timpului.
În acest timp, am închegat o echipă de 8 copii și juniori cu deficiențe senzoriale cu real potențial în performanță sportivă.




Ce ne-am propus
Vrem ca anul școlar viitor să transformăm proiectul Climb Again în curs permanent al școlii pentru deficienți de vedere din București. Vrem ca toți cei 120 de copii ai școlii să beneficieze de cel puțin un antrenament bilunar, prin care să le îmbunătățim percepția spațiului și orientarea, capacitatea de memorare și rezolvare a problemelor, și care să le dea curajul și încrederea în sine pentru o viață independentă ca adulți.


Noi am văzut schimbarea în acești copii, și avem nevoie să arătăm lumii că barierele nu există decât în mintea oamenilor. Ajută-ne să atingem o masă critică de beneficiari și să confirmăm acest sport ca o soluție reală de incluziune socială.
   Ce avem nevoie

Vom construi un panou de escaladă în sala de sport pentru a putea lucra mai ușor cu toți copiii din școală. Avem nevoie de materiale pentru asta.


Vom aduce la antrenamente suplimentare la sala de escaladă pe acei copii care au înclinații spre performanță. Avem nevoie de transport pentru ei.


Vom aduna o echipă mai mare de instructori care să poată lucra intensiv cu grupe mici de copii. Avem nevoie să le răsplătim efortul, după aproape 2 ani de voluntariat.

Vom continua să organizăm concursuri și excursii la munte pentru cei mici. Avem nevoie de fonduri logistice pentru asta.


Pragul de 20.000 $ este minimul necesar pentru un mix de activități care se întind pe 9 luni cât durează anul școlar. În paralel, facem eforturi pentru a obține sponsorizări în echipament sportiv. Dacă nu atingem suma propusă, banii vor fi folosiți tot în programul dedicat copiilor cu deficiențe de vedere, însă numărul beneficiarilor va fi mult mai mic, iar efortul nostru de drămuire a fondurilor mult mai mare.



Cum se schimbă lucrurile? 


Trăim într-o Românie în care acești copii sunt izolați, iar sub 13% din adulții cu dizabilități ajung să muncească și să ducă o viață independentă. Noi vrem să contribuim la schimbare, și am găsit metoda prin care să insuflăm încredere acestor copii. Escalada este un sport incluziv, care aduce în echilibru fizicul și psihicul, și în care diferențele între cei cu nevoi speciale și cei tipici nu există atâta timp cât metodele de învățare sunt adaptate.


De când a apărut Climb Again, am reușit să aducem în săli publice copii cu deficiențe de vedere, să introducem probe pentru ei în concursurile de cățărat, să facem demonstrații și să convingem lumea că singura dizabilitate a lor e proiecția greșită pe care o au oamenii din jur.

differences between typical people and people with special needs tend to
disappear as long as the learning methods are adapted.


Since we started the Climb Again project, we managed to
bring visually impaired children to public gyms and mix them with the typical
crowds, to introduce problems for
paraclimbers at local climbing competitions, to generate awareness and convince
people that the only disability these children have is the faulty projection
the world around has in relation to them.
Let’s keep
on getting these kids out of the house, challenging them and never letting them
become socially awkward. Be a part of
our plan!

<p>For our campaign, our
goal is to reach a minimum of $1000 which would go directly to the Musical
Angels organization. Your donations would mean the world to these hospitalized
children! The funds would allow the organization to purchase musical
instruments that remain in hospitals for children to continue learning and
making music, assist the children in continuing music lessons after they leave
the hospital, and bring the best music teachers to each hospital to teach
weekly lessons. The hospitals are located in the Dallas area. They include the
Children's Medical Center, Scottish Rite Hospital for Children, Our Children's
House at Baylor, and the Medical City Children's Hospital.</p>
<p>We believe this
campaign can improve the lives of many hospitalized children, and hope this
small idea may inspire other hospitals to join in on the effort to really make
a difference in these children's lives.The charity concert will be on September
5th at Zion Lutheran Church (6121 E. Lovers Ln. Dallas, TX 75214) from 2:00pm -
3:30pm. We will be featuring works by Beethoven, Chopin, Mendelssohn,
Ginastera, and Dvorak. We will also have guest artists, the Silver Strings, who
have also performed in various nursing homes across the city of Plano such as
the Legacy at Willow Bend, The Conservatory Senior Living, and the Life Care
Center at Plano. Lastly, there will be a nice reception provided by us, so
please come!</p>
<p>As we enter high
school as seniors in the upcoming school year, time is a very precious asset,

hope you all can come join in, donate, spread the word, and enjoy the Labor Day

Basic education like reading, writing, and
math skills will unlock the world for children. It is the key to jobs and higher education, but also to the simple things we all take for
granted like reading a book, searching Google,
or writing a letter.

 We have seen with our own eyes what future could await them if they don’t catch a break – and that is why we need you!Some of the children in Santa FeA local school for the local children
When we were helping out right after the
hurricane Haiyan in the poor area of Santa Fe near Tacloban, we asked what they would be
needing the most when things got back to normal
in time. They showed us the concrete
foundation for an unfinished building and told us that it was supposed to be a school, but they didn’t
have the resources to finish it. So right now, the volunteer teachers are not able to carry
out proper lessons for the children.
So we decided to help them complete the school!
The drawings are ready, the location is ready, the teachers and the locals who will manage the school are ready. Are you? The building drawing of the school.How can you help We need a lot of help to complete this project – you can help by: Making donations for materials and labor
 EVERY donation – even the smallest one – gets us closer to our goal. We will
 even show you our appreciation by giving you a thank you gift (perk). Donate now by selecting your perk to the right!Spreading the word
 Actually you don’t even need to donate in order to help. If you just 
share the word, you’ll be helping us a lot! So please share this 
campaign on your social media – send your friends an e-mail or a letter!
 Spread the word if you have supported us!Photos from the building of the school.Questions and answersWhy $10,000?We actually need $55,000 to complete the school. But we've already commenced building and collected the first $10,000 by other means. We're collecting the money in stages so the building can progress gradually.

This way, they can be 100% present during the trips and get the best possible experience. </li> <li>All of our trips will be focused on service-learning and adventure-learning. </li>
<li>Each trip will involve a reflection component so the participants can figure out ways to take what they've done on the trip and apply it to their own communities and futures. </li>
<li>A hands-on reorientation program where the participants take a step in applying themselves positively in their own communities after their trips. </li> </ul> <p>Other future goals include:</p>

</div></div>","PandaDraw: The Amazing Drawing and Teaching Robot!

We want to make a fun, low-cost robot that will help parents and teachers teach important STEM concepts, that will engage kids and inspire both creativity and analytical skillsets, and that will allow artists to grow their followings (and make $$)! PandaDraw is currently only on IndieGogo! _______________________________________________________________________Who can use PandaDraw?
Anyone!
TEACHERS: Wouldn't you love a hands-on, interactive, engaging system with which to help explain basic math concepts like geometry, trigonometry, cartesian coordinates, etc? Or even more advanced concepts like calculus, automation, robotics, and 3D printing? What if you could send students cherry-picked problems that are specifically tailored to their personal weaknesses... at any time of day?
PARENTS: 3D printing and automation are revolutionizing the way the world works, so give your kids a head start in the world of STEM! Would you like a fun, easy way to introduce your kids to 3D printing or teach them valuable STEM concepts? Using our robotic xy platform, kids become quickly fascinated with the power of printing and robotics. You can dock any existing pen/marker/pencil/puffy pen directly on to the Panda, upload your drawing, and watch it create unique art. Or, work with your kid to learn new STEM skillsets using the educational package! Our future products will build upon the skills they've learned from PandaDraw and introduce a third axis of automation, as a gateway into the fascinating (and lucrative) world of 3D!ARTISTS: We will initiate challenges to engage our artist community, feature some of the great art work on our blog/twitter/instagram/facebook, and even offer the chance to sell your art (printed on coasters, bags, canvas, coffee mugs, etc). You could earn $$ with your artwork by selling it-- how cool is that!?KIDS: Ever wished you were a brilliant, talented artist?  Our adorable, incredible PandaDraw will connect to the cloud so you can download and draw beautiful, perfect images of anything you want -- abstract art like that shown below (we will even provide many for you!), your portrait, your pet, pictures you've uploaded, etc! ___________________________________________________________________________                     < Draw with the power of code!  Educational fun you will love! > ""Educational fun you'll love!""    _________________________________________________________________________

A better way to learn with the educational package!

The more users there are, the more interactive and bigger the PandaDraw STEM library will be! Users can add to the library their own cool problems for others to solve.
Teach basic math concepts as well as advanced STEM! 



One example of basic geometry: Students learn the relationships between geometric shapes in 2D and 3D. PandaDraw prints out the 2D shapes, and your child can configure the 3D shapes and experiment with the geometries.



Example of basic coordinate graphing. The educational package will teach your child/student very important math fundamentals!




Care to calculate the area of the orange feathers? Or integrate this quarter circle? PandaDraw can even do these problems of higher complexity!
___________________________________________________A better way to draw!
 What will you be drawing with PandaDraw?

         
  

The more users there are, the more interactive, fun, and robust the PandaDraw art community will be!

<h3>Who We Are:</h3>
<ul>
<li>CDA Climbing School was established early 2018 in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.</li>
<li>We are in the process of acquiring permitting and licensing to host the school at Q'emiln City Park in Post Falls, Idaho. We have been working closely with the City of Post Falls Parks department and have their blessing to pursue this project. We are currently most of the way through the permitting process and don't anticipate any hangups.</li>
<li>CDA Climbing School exists to serve our local recreational community and beyond.</li>
<li>The aim of CDA Climbing School is to give the local community the knowledge and know-how in order to use the appropriate techniques while minimizing risk in the outdoors.</li>
<li>CDA Climbing School is not intended to be a guiding service.</li>
<li>Our practices are based on years of experience and modeled after safety standards set forth by the AMGA (American Mountain Guides Association) and PCIA (Professional Climbing Instructors Association).</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Vision</h3>
<ul>
<li>The bulk of the business end of CDA Climbing School will be operating our Summer Youth Program which will run from June 11, 2018 to August 30th, 2018 at Q'emilin City Park in Post Falls, Idaho. The day camp will operate Monday - Thursday, 9am - 5pm and is open to climbers 11-17 years of age. The main idea with the Summer Day Camp format is that kids get an outdoor education as well as climbing instruction.</li>
<li>Adult programming is also available and will run from the time we receive our permits until the weather makes a turn towards winter likely around October. Cold weather climbing clinics may become available based on interest and demand. Adult clinics are short (3 hours) and to the point. During times when our Youth Programming is running adult clinics will be available from 5:30pm - 8:30pm Monday - Thursday, and open for various times during the weekend. Recommended ages for adult clinics are 16+.</li>
<li>Curriculum is broken down into 5 subjects: Belaying, Anchors, Rappelling, Technical Rescue, and Climbing Movement and Technique.</li>
<li>Custom clinics such as lead climbing (leading a climb from the ground up and clipping permanent protection as you climb) and trad climbing (traditional climbing where you place removable protection as you climb) are also available upon meeting certain prerequisites and assessments based on our 5 core curriculum subjects.</li>
<li>If we receive enough demand a Climbing with Kids (10 and under) clinic will become available.</li>
<li>In the future, we hope to expand to more of the surrounding area as things develop to include multi-pitch climbing instruction.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>CDA Climbing School is currently being funded solely out of pocket by the founder. We are using Indiegogo as a tool to judge interest in the climbing school as well as raising additional funding to make the school as beneficial as it can be to the community.</li>
<li>If we hit $1,000 climbing shoes will be available free of charge for our clinics.</li>
<li>If we hit $2,000 a ""Community Climbs with Us"" free day will be hosted.</li>
<li>If we hit $4,000 two ""Community Climbs with Us"" free days will be hosted.</li>
<li>If we hit $6,000 a seasonal shop dedicated to all things climbing will be opened locally.</li>
<li>If we hit $8,000 a sizable climbing shoe rental fleet will be purchased and made available to the public.</li>
<li>If we hit $10,000 we will begin the process of expanding our programming into the surrounding areas of Idaho.</li>
<li>If we hit $12,000 a seasonal climbing shop dedicated to climbing will be opened during warm months as well as a used winter gear trade open in the colder months.</li>
<li>Each benefit is accumulative to the next.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>We strongly believe rock climbing is beneficial physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually.</li>
<li>Empower our community to conquer fears and develop that ""CAN DO"" attitude.</li>
<li>Help educate the community about preserving our recreational resources for future generations.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risk Management</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rock Climbing is an inherently dangerous sport. We can minimize the risk with proper education and training, and those skills can be passed around by a tight knit community.</li>
<li>Lead instructors are at a minimum fully certified Single Pitch Instructors through either the AMGA or PCIA.</li>
<li>Assistant Instructors have learned all of the required curriculum, but are not yet certified.</li>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The Learn Or Teach Spiel</h2>
<p>My name is Clever Mukori and yes, my folks are still trying to figure out the distinction between an adjective and a noun, love 'em though! I was born in Zimbabwe and consider myself very fortunate for divine providence and parents that had the means to afford me a top tier education. At present, i'm a Chemistry &amp; Biology graduate of Concordia College in Moorhead, MN, an institution that not only deserves credit for my recent medical school admission, but for teaching me to Be Responsibly Engaged in the World (BREW).</p>
<p>Through study, research, and my experiences living in Africa and now the United States, I've become deeply aware of the unique educational challenges that various communities worldwide are facing and have founded Learn Or Teach to address these. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526162085/ymzlzfs9rvrhvqwsnqif.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Learn Or Teach is a Cross-disciplinary online learning platform that provides FREE learning content on Anything, Anytime, and Anywhere. In addition, we provide ratings based compensation to our content contributors, who can be anyone but typically range from college education majors to primary/secondary education teachers, professors, and tradesmen/women.</p>
<p>With respect to addressing barriers to educational access, not only do we provide our content completely and eternally free, we establish physical learning centers in needy communities. This we do by forming public and private partnerships with primarily local institutions and leveraging existing systems such as libraries or schools and providing technological resources that students can use to access our content.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526162284/tnhtzh5bele7kwfbldee.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition, we are partnering with Facebook on their <a href=""https://info.internet.org/en/story/free-basics-from-internet-org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Free Basics</a> platform, which is a limited free version of the internet available through mobile connectivity in about 50 developing countries presently. By submitting our website to their platform, we will be able to reach millions of the world’s neediest learners, from tender first graders to small business farming women eager to learn new marketing and production skills.</p>
<p> Learn Or Teach generates revenue through advertising, charitable donations and SAAS products such as Learning Management System Services and workforce training services. The unique combination of our content acquisition, access facilitation, and revenue generation strategies set apart Learn Or Teach as an industry leading education services company.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>What We Need </u></h3>
</div><div>
<p>We divided our project into two phases, each of which will take 6 months to develop. We are scheduled to start Phase 1 development in June of 2018 and reach completion by the end of December 2018. Phase 1 will be launched in January of 2019. The second phase will begin in June of 2019 and end in December of 2019. Phase 2 will launch in January of 2020. Our fundraising goal is our total yearly budget for all costs associated with developing, launching the first phase, and operating until June 2019. The breakdown is as follows:</p>

<li>Marketing - $5,000</li>
<li>Legal Proceedings - $2,000</li>
<li>Miscellaneous - $18,000 ( cloud services, operational, technical services etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>If the campaign does not succeed as expected, we will seek V.C. investment and combine the campaign funds with future investment dollars.</p>
<p>Learn Or Teach is a product for and by the people, so it is up to us the people to spread the word far and wide to everyone who will lend and ear. Please back us, follow us on facebook, twitter, instagram, linkedin, and snapchat, and share our campaign on these platforms and via email! Let is spread like a fire! </p>

</div></div>","The Learn Or Teach Spiel
My name is Clever Mukori and yes, my folks are still trying to figure out the distinction between an adjective and a noun, love 'em though! I was born in Zimbabwe and consider myself very fortunate for divine providence and parents that had the means to afford me a top tier education. At present, i'm a Chemistry & Biology graduate of Concordia College in Moorhead, MN, an institution that not only deserves credit for my recent medical school admission, but for teaching me to Be Responsibly Engaged in the World (BREW).
Through study, research, and my experiences living in Africa and now the United States, I've become deeply aware of the unique educational challenges that various communities worldwide are facing and have founded Learn Or Teach to address these. 

Learn Or Teach is a Cross-disciplinary online learning platform that provides FREE learning content on Anything, Anytime, and Anywhere. In addition, we provide ratings based compensation to our content contributors, who can be anyone but typically range from college education majors to primary/secondary education teachers, professors, and tradesmen/women.
With respect to addressing barriers to educational access, not only do we provide our content completely and eternally free, we establish physical learning centers in needy communities. This we do by forming public and private partnerships with primarily local institutions and leveraging existing systems such as libraries or schools and providing technological resources that students can use to access our content.

 
In addition, we are partnering with Facebook on their Free Basics platform, which is a limited free version of the internet available through mobile connectivity in about 50 developing countries presently. By submitting our website to their platform, we will be able to reach millions of the world’s neediest learners, from tender first graders to small business farming women eager to learn new marketing and production skills.
 Learn Or Teach generates revenue through advertising, charitable donations and SAAS products such as Learning Management System Services and workforce training services. The unique combination of our content acquisition, access facilitation, and revenue generation strategies set apart Learn Or Teach as an industry leading education services company.
 
What We Need 

We divided our project into two phases, each of which will take 6 months to develop. We are scheduled to start Phase 1 development in June of 2018 and reach completion by the end of December 2018. Phase 1 will be launched in January of 2019. The second phase will begin in June of 2019 and end in December of 2019. Phase 2 will launch in January of 2020. Our fundraising goal is our total yearly budget for all costs associated with developing, launching the first phase, and operating until June 2019. The breakdown is as follows:
 


Software Development - $45,000
Marketing - $5,000
Legal Proceedings - $2,000
Miscellaneous - $18,000 ( cloud services, operational, technical services etc)

If the campaign does not succeed as expected, we will seek V.C. investment and combine the campaign funds with future investment dollars.
Learn Or Teach is a product for and by the people, so it is up to us the people to spread the word far and wide to everyone who will lend and ear. Please back us, follow us on facebook, twitter, instagram, linkedin, and snapchat, and share our campaign on these platforms and via email! Let is spread like a fire!

He has 5 employees working for him, and is saving to buy more equipment and relocate to a larger space. His goals are to expand, offer a better service to customers, and become one of the biggest competitors in the area.  The pilot project is fundamental for the success of our business mentorship organisation. Help us bring this pilot project to life, so together we can help entrepreneur's achieve success in places where the opportunities we have had aren't present.

They will meet part of our team, and be introduced to the entrepreneurs each of them will be working with. The entrepreneurs were extremely welcoming and excited the first time I met them, and were willing to take over an hour out of each of their days to talk with me and walk me through their businesses. This being said, communication may pose a challenge at first - as we have different accents and speak at different paces - but after spending time with each other, these barriers will fall to the side. As I mentioned, I also have a dedicated, passionate team on the ground there who are happy to attend meetings and assist in any way possible.",14.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Meet Lee:</h3>
<p>Hi everyone, my name is Lee Stockner. I'm the creator of Occupational Octaves™.  As a child, I was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder but also showed signs of talent at the piano. While struggling through mainstream educational and social challenges, I developed an identity immersed in music. At 15, I was a classical pianist and I began my life as a music educator. Ten years later I was teaching at a local music store and met a woman with her son who was on the Autism Spectrum. They were looking for piano lessons and with no special education training or experience, I offered to be his piano teacher. His mom helped me navigate the behavioral and communicative challenges of teaching with adaptations and he learned to play. As we continued, she encouraged me to work with more students on the Autism Spectrum because I was ""a natural.""</p>

<p>So, in 2007 I began working at schools for individuals severely affected by Autism in the Long Island area. By the time I was 27, I created the Special-Needs-User-Friendly language of music that would eventually become Occupational Octaves Piano™ because unlike my first student, many can't read traditional notation. Having already met parents of special learners who had unsatisfying experiences at music lessons, I knew the market was there for me to try and grow a local business. While developing a client base, I learned to identify the areas of communication, concentration, and interaction that were lacking for each student, which helped me learn numerous ways to adapt the piano lesson and support individual needs.</p>
<p>Over the years I posted videos of what my students were accomplishing, and people began reaching out to use the program themselves. I self-published my original curriculum to share my program and since then, hundreds of music educators, music therapists, occupational therapists, and special educators around the world have purchased the book series! My goal is to expand my curriculum to include many more instruments, starting with the drums, bass and guitar.</p>

<h3>Why you should care:</h3>
<p>This New Language of Music has limitless potential. It allows people who can’t comprehend and/or properly use traditional music notation to play with ease and independence. The Special-Needs-User-Friendly approach allows a broad range of instructors, regardless of musical knowledge, to teach it and apply their own expertise to the platform. For example, an Occupational Therapist may use it help someone strengthen their fingers, a Special Educator may use it to help someone increase their attention span, and a Music Therapist may use it to target a broad range of non-musical goals. With Occupational Octaves™, students play right away, which captures the imagination. Imagination is the root of motivation, and our students are motivated!</p>

<p>Rough Cuts Pte Ltd is a television company that has been producing television shows for  the last 16 years. After directing 52 episodes of a children's series, we realized that children would learn to read early, if they were as engaged as they were with television. </p>
<p>After 8 months of researching on the available technologies and speaking to parents and child educators, we had a ‘eureka’ moment. We came up with an idea to get kids engaged in books and away from tablets and phones. </p>
<p>We decided to make an actual book with pages that they could turn but now have the words light up word for word as the book is read to them. </p>
<p>Yes you heard correctly. Not a tablet. Not a phone but a book with hidden lights and sound inside each of its pages. </p>
<p><b>BRINGING LIFE TO BOOKS</b></p>
<p>Children have a wild imagination. We designed a technology that would awaken that imagination so that through music, sound effects and voices that replicate the ones on cartoons, everything on the page came alive because they imagined it to come alive. </p>
<p><b>But this wasn’t the bigger picture. </b></p>
<p>The bigger picture was that not only did regular preschoolers struggle with learning how to read, there were the children who struggled with <b><i>Dyslexia. </i></b></p>
<p>We learnt that children with <i>Dyslexia would benefit most</i> from a book that <i>read aloud to them</i> and showed them what was being read at the same time! </p>
<p>So now we had a book that engaged the kids and brought the words to life. The book highlights the words as it reads to them. Like singing a karaoke! All of their senses are aroused and they are now reading even before speaking as early as 1 years of age. </p>
<p>Call us old fashion but as parents, we grew up with books that transported us to places we could only dream up. With this technology we hope that we can bring back the love for books in children and help kids with Dyslexia.</p>
<p>The big dream is to eventually make series of books with fascinating stories that will inculcate not just the love for reading but unleash the great big imagination in their little minds. </p>
<p>Our children have young, pure, creative minds and they don't need to watch the television, phone or tablet to make a fairy fly or a dragon spit fire. Let them be the directors of their own movie in the books they read. </p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>This special book works with two unique functions, sound and light. An in-built audio and light system board achieves this. </p>
<p>As the book reads, the words on the page are highlighted, synchronizing the sound with words, a fun way of teach your child to read on his own at the same time develop his motor skills.</p>
<p>The book also connects with child on different levels.</p>
<p>For instance pressing the play button activates the lights on the cover page, bringing the book to life. Pressing it plays music, as it would on an Mp3 player.</p>
<p>The narration of the stories will be done by voice over artiste with the accompaniment of music and sound effects. Think, Disney Read-Along Books with CDs that you pop into your car player but now all that in a book, in your child's hands.  </p>

<h3><b>TECHNOLOGY TO HELP CHILDREN WITH DYSLEXIA</b></h3>
<h3><b> </b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Dyslexia is an auditory/language problem, visual/perceptual problem, and often also a visual/motor (eye/hand) problem Educators have not been able to agree on what dyslexia really is. Some authorities believe that is strictly a language-processing problem that involves the distinguishing of sounds of letters. Others believe that it is a visual/perceptual problem since these children reverse words laterally as well as scrambling letters when they read and write.</p>
<p>After much study, experts have suggested some ways in which children that struggle with Dyslexia can recognize words:</p>

Call us old fashion but as parents, we grew up with books that transported us to places we could only dream up. With this technology we hope that we can bring back the love for books in children and help kids with Dyslexia.
The big dream is to eventually make series of books with fascinating stories that will inculcate not just the love for reading but unleash the great big imagination in their little minds. 
Our children have young, pure, creative minds and they don't need to watch the television, phone or tablet to make a fairy fly or a dragon spit fire. Let them be the directors of their own movie in the books they read. 



THE BOOK    






·Multi-sensory experience through touch, visual and auditory activities

·Colorful, Read-Aloud book springs to life with voice and music

·Led powered, Self-lighting words as the book reads 

·Battery operated (Safe for children)


·Built to sharpen motor skills

·World’s first in read-along technology


This special book works with two unique functions, sound and light. An in-built audio and light system board achieves this. 
As the book reads, the words on the page are highlighted, synchronizing the sound with words, a fun way of teach your child to read on his own at the same time develop his motor skills.
The book also connects with child on different levels.
For instance pressing the play button activates the lights on the cover page, bringing the book to life. Pressing it plays music, as it would on an Mp3 player.
The narration of the stories will be done by voice over artiste with the accompaniment of music and sound effects. Think, Disney Read-Along Books with CDs that you pop into your car player but now all that in a book, in your child's hands.  



TECHNOLOGY TO HELP CHILDREN WITH DYSLEXIA
 

Dyslexia is an auditory/language problem, visual/perceptual problem, and often also a visual/motor (eye/hand) problem Educators have not been able to agree on what dyslexia really is. Some authorities believe that is strictly a language-processing problem that involves the distinguishing of sounds of letters. Others believe that it is a visual/perceptual problem since these children reverse words laterally as well as scrambling letters when they read and write.
After much study, experts have suggested some ways in which children that struggle with Dyslexia can recognize words:





EXPERT SUGGESTIONS


TECHNOLOGY




Motivate them


The technology in the book will engage them with its sound and
  light elements.




Read Aloud


The technology in the
  book will help them decode, and make it easy for them to understand the
  meaning.




Let younger children ""pretend"" to read


The technology in the
  book will encourage them to read the story aloud together.




Let them follow your voice


The technology shows them which word Is being read so they can
  mimic the reader.




Use print which is large


This book is catered to
  all preschoolers as such large prints will be inherent in the book.




If you have a computer, equip it with software that reads
  aloud


The technology in the book will not require them to go on the
  computer especially if they are at a younger age. This will allow parents to
  address Dyslexia as early as 21/2 to 3 years of age.




Use recorded books or audio books


This technology is just that.







WHAT WE NEED


We need to raise 40,000 USD for this prototype. A book of this nature, requires an actual working prototype. The money will be used to make it's working prototype.

GRAND TOTAL : 39,600 USD



SUMMARY


 ""There is a cultural narrative about how electronic devices are pulling children away from books. In this busy screen dominated environment many children are simply not in the habit of reading, because their eyeballs are glued to their phones and ipads.Technophobes think we are raising a generation that doesn’t understand the value of literature.
How do we preserve the art of reading for pleasure? Do we even want to? We say a resounding yes, because reading for pleasure is the single biggest indicator of a child's success academically, more than social background or parents' education."" 
Together, let us instil the love for books in our kids. 
                                                                                                                           - FORBES




WHAT ELSE

We have launched this new campaign to
raise the funds necessary to help us pay for prototyping cost. Each dollar you donate will bring us
closer in making the world's first KARAOKE BOOK for children.
Any extra funds we raise will go
towards offsetting our operational cost.



OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP



As always, we appreciate everything
you do, if a monetary donation is not a possibility for you right now, please

<p>Hello, my name is Pete Brown. I’m a former
elementary teacher, turned arts administrator originally from Detroit, MI. For

a decade I worked at a museum in town. During my time there I learned the ins
and outs of our organization, and many others across the country. </p>
<p>As a former teacher, education was paramount
in the roles I had at the museum. I was especially passionate about educating
our visitors through a variety of multimedia outlets; audio, video, still
images and text. Most teachers have heard of the <i>multiple intelligences</i>, the idea that all learners are different
and require that information be presented in ways to suit their learning style.
This concept, combined with the ever-growing use of mobile smart-device
technology, led me to begin the search into creating a custom mobile app for
our organization.</p>
<p>I quickly realized that this was unattainable
for us due to the associated costs, the timeframe and our need for additional

nowhere, so in 2013 I resigned to create a solution to the need that plagued so
many cultural organizations across the country; the need to meet visitors on

In the end we hope to impact as many lives as possible and give them the basic beginning skills to change their situation and help start them on the road to self sufficiency through glass.  In the early days of the United States, every colony had a glass blower to produce glass for the community. It was a working business model then, and it can work now. Together we can change lives one piece of glass at a time.     Risks & Challenges

Selling nearly everything you own and setting off on a 5 year adventure to help change the lives of others comes with many challenges. When your home has wheels and those wheels brake, When your home has wheels and is constantly moving and you need to get mail, When your teaching lampworking and your classroom needs to be mobile, oxygen generation, kilns, etc. There are many risks, and many challenges we expect to have to overcome on this journey, but we have full faith that with your help both in your contributions and your hospitality along the road we can help change lives together.
  Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:  We are partnering with some of the largest RV resorts in North America to ensure we have a place to park our wheels, but not everywhere that people want to learn have an in network RV resort. Maybe some day we can camp in your back yard for 3 days while we run a class.
You could share this campaign on your facebook and other social media pages to help draw attention from others who might be able to contribute. 

Maybe you have something in your collection you made that you want to donate to our mobile store front to help keep fuel in the tank. 

If every glass blower in the USA donated only $5 we would reach our goal in 1 day.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

only has until the 29th of November to raise the money. Please help to

<p>
</p><p>Hello, my name is David
and I am here to tell you about the project “Next Great Writer”.  As you have probably witnessed, children have
the largest, wildest imaginations, ripe for writing and full of creativity.  Yet writing sometimes takes a back seat in
education. We aim to help youth students excel as writers and prepare them to
be great writers by combining an exclusive detailed writing curriculum tailored
specifically to their age.  No one else
is doing anything like this right now and we feel uniquely qualified to roll
out this program.  That is why “Next
Great Writer” holds such a strong place in our society. </p>
<p>So you may be wondering…
What is the Next Great Writer??</p>
<p>Next Great Writer is a rare
opportunity for children between the ages of 13 and 18 years of age to write a
book about something that they are passionate about. The Next Great Writer
program is a Nonprofit Organization that provides kids with the necessary
tools, skills, and guidance to successfully write their 1st book. Though our
program is online based we will be interactive with our students through our
regular webinars, chat boards, and emails. Along the 9-month writing part of
the program we will guide our students from chapter one all the way until they
have a completed manuscript for publishing and contests. After their book is
completed, we help polish their book and if the students want their book will
be submitted into the Next Great Writer Awards contest.  Entry into the program and contest is free
for all dedicated participants.  Not only
will this teach children the joys of writing but the resilience of going
through the process and the reward that will follow, seeing their book in its
final format.</p>
<p>The goal of this campaign
is to reach like-minded people for collaboration, raise money in exchange for
early access and rewards, and we also want to spread the word.  The more people we can get signed up for the
“Next Great Writer” the more functional and successful it will be.  So this campaign will give you the basics on
our efforts and progress.  Beyond that we
encourage you to ask us questions, donate and get involved.  We developed “Next Great Writer” for your
benefit, so enjoy!  We believe we are
really onto an easier way to get kids excited about writing, while enjoying
their innovative efforts.</p>
<p>Do you ever think about helping
your child write something they can be proud of?</p>
<p>Do you see your child
enjoying writing but don’t know where they can take the next step?</p>
<p>Are you interested in
helping your child get published but don’t have the time?</p>
<p>If you answered, “Yes” to
any of these questions, you may want to keep reading…</p>
<p>With the contribution of
$1, $5, or even $100 you will receive some really cool perks; cash
contributions of all sums are accepted. This is just the beginning of an
awesome journey, and you are welcomed to come on board. But wait, why not let
your friends in on this, share this with them through word of mouth, emails and
social media and have them do the same!</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Our
Success So Far…</b></p>
<p>The Next Great Writer program will be
led and managed by David (d. E.) Rogers.
He is also the author of nine novels himself. 
He will be leveraging all his knowledge and experience to make this
program memorable for all of the youth participants.  Mr. Rogers has also directed several short
films. In addition to his writing accolades, d. E. is a Stanford
University-certified project manager; and has attended the University of Notre
Dame for executive leadership and management and the New York Film
 Academy for film
production. </p>
<p>His enormous skill set will be a very
valuable asset in ensuring the success of the program. Other management and
staff members will be brought on as we grow and build this amazing nonprofit
organization.  High caliber writers,
authors, and communications professionals will surround the youth attending
this program.  This will be the
opportunity of a lifetime for the children to grow and nurture their skills.</p>
<p><b></b></p><b>
</b><p><b>More about
the Issue:</b></p>
<p>America
is failing in literacy. Our reading and writing levels are below average and
decreasing each year. With reading and writing going hand in hand the Next
Great Writer program will make students increase their literacy skills. In our
popular culture we reinforce the idea that WRITING A BOOK is hard, time
consuming and sometimes not worthwhile. We're out to change that fallacious
idea one “Next Great Writer” at a time! Help us establish this initiative to
serve people in need of a solution. As little as a $1 donation a “Next Great
Writer” student will have the opportunity to accomplish something that
they will be proud of for the rest of his or her life. Empower us to make
this vision a reality with a donation to this project today!</p>

<p>Here

across the US. We want to make college campuses as safe as possible
for all students who work so hard to attend them. In order to shift student sexual interactions norms from the outdated standard of “No
Means No” to “Yes Means Yes,” society as a whole will have to work together to
increase awareness. <br/></p>

Here
at ISCE, we recognize the gravity of the campus date rape culture plaguing students
across the US. We want to make college campuses as safe as possible
for all students who work so hard to attend them. In order to shift student sexual interactions norms from the outdated standard of “No
Means No” to “Yes Means Yes,” society as a whole will have to work together to
increase awareness. 
To
address this issue head on, we have developed a family of apps to facilitate
affirmative consent.   See http://protectequalsrespect.com


A modern day issue demands a modern day solution. These
apps hope to change the context of these encounters and develop an environment
in which asking for consent is standard.To
combat this issue, we will need your help! We are asking for contributions to
help distribute these apps to as many students as possible at no cost to the
users. We hope that as more people start to change their practices/assumptions,
we can make campus date rape a thing of the past.

   The Impact
Here are some birth statistics that definitely need to change through consumer demand


The U.S. National cesarean rate hovers close to
33% and varies between states and among hospital. For example: in Florida two hospitals had a 62%
rate in 2013!!

1970 there was a 5.5% rate. Rates rose through
1989, then dipped slowly. 1998 rates began to rise then level off to the 33%
range where they are today. The questions I would ask ;

1)Are women’s bodies
broken? 2) How many of these surgeries are medically necessary? 3)What trends
and factors are contributing to this alarming rate of birth by surgery? 4) Do
women and families know their rights and all options available to them in
birth?

Many women have limited or no access to prenatal
care and education. Let’s bring it to them!!!


Family’s choices in birth are dictated by
insurance and availability to all options including birth centers and home.


Geography determines whether a woman can utilize
a midwife or have an out of hospital birth, as laws vary state to state.



We can do better in the USA,
where we have the resources and technology to save lives. Optimal care in
childbirth includes evidence, provider wisdom, and parental choice and
circumstances.
Consumers who are educated about
birthing options, benefits and risks of tests and procedures, and birth
terminology and process have the power to choose from an informed position.

The labor force needs more people who know how to do things and are not afraid to build things with their hands; the ones who do not sit and wait for someone to tell them step-by-step how to do a task, but instead figure it out for themselves. This project will help cultivate these people and grow their understanding of aviation and the aeronautical sciences.</p><h4>So how is your project going to help the community meet this challenge?</h4><p>This will be accomplished by establishing a youth aircraft building community group to effectively introduce students to associated aviation technology, and help them gain exposure to both full scale and remote control operations (RC aircraft, multirotors, and entry level First-Person View (FPV)/Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs)). Students in successful education programs learn how to solve problems and have the opportunity to use technology solutions to do so, which is exactly what will be done here.</p><h4>How will it be done?</h4><p>This will be done through the design and build of low cost RC aircraft, hands-on setup and trial of entry level autonomous FPV systems and the related programming, expanding youth connections with local aviation resources in Upstate South Carolina (Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA)/Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA)/Academy of Model Aeronautics (AMA)/Western Carolina RC (WCRC)/Triple Tree Aerodrome), promotion of attendance at local flying events, RC piloting skills training, and the development of participation events (streamer cutting combat, obstacle course challenges, autonomous competitions, etc.). Challenges will be set up for students to tackle, including having to design, build, test, refine, and then compete with their own design. Education will be more hands-on and project-based, integrating traditional liberal arts thinking into problem solving exercises that emphasize technology.</p><h2>How This Project Is Different</h2><p>This project is different in that it will be peer-to-peer and community-based (as opposed to school-based), and will allow all students to be independently involved, but still work together and collaborate in a community. Other programs, such as school robotics, offer similar structure, but unfortunately are limited in the number of participants that can be directly involved (primarily due to inherent costs of such programs). This project, because of its extremely low cost, allows all students involved to directly participate.</p><h2>Why We Need Your Support</h2><p>In order to get things off the ground with the Upstate SC Youth Aviators Club, we need build and challenge supplies. The airplanes flown will be based off of the free plans available from Flite Test (<a href=""http://www.flitetest.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.flitetest.com/</a>), an organization dedicated to expanding the hobby through extremely inexpensive RC airplanes made out of ""Dollar Tree"" Foam Core, as well as designs that students come up with themselves. This allows complete airplanes to be very inexpensive (&lt;$60), making it cost effective to teach piloting skills. The motor and Electronic Speed Control (ESC) are also part of a removable pod that can be transferred from plane to plane, so many different airplanes can be flown with one motor and ESC, further reducing cost. The platform of ""Dollar Tree"" Foam Core is perfect for designing and testing as well. Using free, open source CAD software, students will be able to design their own planes in 3D and then export the plans to be cut out, built, tested, refined, and then used to compete with against other students. Multirotor and low cost FPV equipment (~$300 for a complete setup including both) is also needed to introduce students to Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) technology, which is expected to play a key role in the future. Especially with the autonomous capabilities of many flight control systems available today, students will be able to not only focus on the technology itself, but also how to apply that technology to solve real-world problems. Using low cost technology now available to RC hobby enthusiasts, the equipment we will be using is perfect for entry level exposure and can be scaled up based on need, growth, and support. Challenge supplies will also need to be purchased to set up and host events where students can come and compete. Giving students the opportunity to directly participate in technology-based activities where equipment can be shared in a collaborative manner is a great way to accomplish the goal of optimizing the resources available, making it possible to expose many students to the technology at a very low cost. All contributors who donate more than $50 will receive a handwritten, personalized Thank You note, and all sponsors who donate more than $1,000 will have the option to have their name or company logo put on all aircraft as well as identification as a sponsor wherever else suitable.</p><h2>Project Levels</h2><h4>Primary Level</h4><p>The initial goal of the project is to get a group of students not already involved with aviation building and flying RC airplanes and multirotors. Challenges will also be set up for students to compete in. This will establish a community for collaboration and peer mentoring, and prove the feasibility of the model.</p><h4>Secondary Level</h4><p>In the secondary level of the project, design will be incorporated. Students will design, build, test, refine, and then compete with their own aircraft in challenges. This level also includes very low cost FPV equipment, allowing students to fly using goggles as if they were in the cockpit of the aircraft. This opens up more opportunities for learning and challenge. Real-world application of technology will also be explored, such as using small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUASs) for conservation purposes. The group will also explore full scale aviation as well through resources available at Triple Tree Aerodrome, EAA Chapter #249, and other local aviation associations.</p><h4>Stretch Goal Towards Vision</h4><p>Once a solid community group has been established, proving the feasibility of the project and acting as a model for other groups to follow, efforts will transition to promoting school clubs that can be incorporated into high schools across the nation. By encouraging other schools and organizations to get involved, aviation and the benefits it brings can be expanded to a much larger audience, further benefiting the community.</p><h4>If We Meet and Exceed Our Funding Goal</h4><p>If we meet our goal, this project will have enough funds to enter the secondary level. Additional funds will be used to continue progress to higher levels, and will also allow the project to be done at a larger scale with more students being able to directly participate (more funds = more airplanes and multirotors = more pilots = larger program).</p><h2>Vision</h2><p>We envision having high schools across the United States and around the world involved with aviation challenges. In conjunction with school robotics programs, we see students designing, building, testing, refining, and programming small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUASs) used to compete in autonomous challenges similar to robotics, but in three dimensions. This would be more difficult, increasing the benefit of the program. It also exposes students to the technology available, and skills acquired will directly transfer to careers such as UAS operation.</p><h2>About the Project Coordinator</h2><p><i>""Adam is a junior at Greenville High School interested in advancing academic standards through student and community participation in STEM.

</div>
<p>   Over the last 5 years, we built the <a href=""http://anatomy4sculptors.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">anatomy4sculptors.com</a> website and then published our book by the same name with the help of a professional photographer, models, editor, and a graphic designer. Using dozens of books and countless online resources as references, in combination with licensed anatomical photographs, we created hundreds of illustrations visualizing the human body and its features. </p>
<p>   Since we successfully crowd funded and published the book two years ago, we have distributed over four-and-half thousand copies in hardcover and paperback, as well as digital copies. We have also been privileged to present our work at numerous art colleges and universities. The more people we have met along the way, the more people have told us that our book makes for an amazing resource not only for classical artists and sculptors, but also for CG artists.</p>

<p>   We've priced our project at the absolute bare minimum. If we raise more, we'll be able to produce a larger print-run, use better paper stock, and do full-color interiors. Here's a breakdown of what is involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Production costs</b> - includes author/illustrator/CG artist team, marketing team, video production, book layout design, poster and t-shirts for pledges. </li>
<li>
<b>Indiegogo/PayPal Fees</b> - Roughly 8%-10% of final funding. </li>
<li>
<b>Production of books</b> - These rates vary depending on the amount ordered, but it is likely our most sizable budget item. </li>
<li>
<b>Development of iOS/Android Augmented Reality app</b>. </li>
<li>
<b>Shipping &amp; shipping supply</b> - Another sizable expense, depending on amount shipped and number of international orders. </li>
<li>
<b>Taxes</b> - self-employed rates apply. </li>
<li>
<b>Buffer Amount</b> - necessary for ANY Kickstarter. Set aside for dropped pledges, lost books, refund requests, and any miscalculations.</li>

<b>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</b><p></p>
<p>We have the experience of successfully funding a Kickstarter campaign for the original Anatomy for Sculptors book, and to date have delivered 4600 books around the globe. Our team is in place with additional support for this larger and more technologically demanding campaign, and we expect to be able to move full-steam ahead according to plan.</p>
<p>Potential Challenges are:</p>
<p>1. Development and coding for the Augmented Reality application, which may take longer than anticipated. </p>
<p>2. The manufacture and delivery of custom manufactured rewards, such as teaching display models, which may also take longer than initially planned.</p>
<p>We have done extensive planning and pre-work, so we are confident that we will be able to make our deadlines and meet our milestones on time - or in some cases, even be ready with print rewards early. However, in case of any delays, we will provide our backers with clear and timely communication of the status of this project and provide updated delivery estimates.</p>
<p>Thank you again for your support and confidence in Anatomy For Sculptors!</p>

Sometimes a 2D image alone is just not enough. When painting, sculpting, or creating digital models, artists often struggle with understanding flat images using poorly explained reference books and anatomically incorrect digital files, tools, and assets that are overflowing the Internet.  With our second book we are redefining the human head, often the most difficult area of human anatomy to understand. This time we are taking it a step further by bringing this imagery to you in full 3D. By connecting the images in our new book to the Augmented Reality smartphone app, you will have access to precise 3D model images wherever and whenever you need them.  This book focuses exclusively on using 3D modeling, CT, MRi and 3D scan techniques of the head & neck. It covers forms, shapes, facial topography, gender differences, age groups, body types, ethnicities, and the anatomy of the human head and neck.Here is a brief rundown of the estimated 150 page content of head and neck anatomy of female & male, senior, adult, teen, child and baby:Skull, muscles, cartilages, fat pads, glands, blood, vessels, cervical vertebrates, thyroid, function and form, shapes and masses, ethnicity, eye movement, mouth expressions, nose reference, ear reference, functions of facial muscles, dynamic and age wrinkles, proportions, emotions, edge loops and mesh flows, facial topography & Facial Action Coding System  Augmented Reality or AR is a type of virtual reality that aims to duplicate the world's environment in silico or in a computer.

If we are able to raise funds beyond the goal there are many opportunities to make this book and app better by adding additional features and 3D content that has been left out to keep the page count, development time, and cost lower. The more funding we raise - the more 3D features and interactive elements the book will have.

The more people we have met along the way, the more people have told us that our book makes for an amazing resource not only for classical artists and sculptors, but also for CG artists.

   Originally headed by myself and anatomy teacher and illustrator Uldis Zarins, our core team has grown to include CG Artist Jon Hanzelka, Project Manager and Digital Artist Sergio Alessandro, Marketing and Communications Manager Lisa Donze, programmer Janis Kondrats, graphic designer Edgars Vegners and business adviser Reinis Znotins.





   We've priced our project at the absolute bare minimum. If we raise more, we'll be able to produce a larger print-run, use better paper stock, and do full-color interiors. Here's a breakdown of what is involved:


Production costs - includes author/illustrator/CG artist team, marketing team, video production, book layout design, poster and t-shirts for pledges. 

Indiegogo/PayPal Fees - Roughly 8%-10% of final funding. 

Production of books - These rates vary depending on the amount ordered, but it is likely our most sizable budget item. 

Development of iOS/Android Augmented Reality app. 

Shipping & shipping supply - Another sizable expense, depending on amount shipped and number of international orders. 

Taxes - self-employed rates apply. 

Buffer Amount - necessary for ANY Kickstarter. Set aside for dropped pledges, lost books, refund requests, and any miscalculations.



















RISKS AND CHALLENGES
We have the experience of successfully funding a Kickstarter campaign for the original Anatomy for Sculptors book, and to date have delivered 4600 books around the globe. Our team is in place with additional support for this larger and more technologically demanding campaign, and we expect to be able to move full-steam ahead according to plan.
Potential Challenges are:
1. Development and coding for the Augmented Reality application, which may take longer than anticipated. 
2. The manufacture and delivery of custom manufactured rewards, such as teaching display models, which may also take longer than initially planned.
We have done extensive planning and pre-work, so we are confident that we will be able to make our deadlines and meet our milestones on time - or in some cases, even be ready with print rewards early. However, in case of any delays, we will provide our backers with clear and timely communication of the status of this project and provide updated delivery estimates.

<p>The American Legion Post 41 Jr. Shooting Sports Program is a non-profit organization (501 C 19) based out of Keyser, WV.  The American Legion Junior Shooting Sports Program is a gun safety education and marksmanship program that encompasses the basic elements of safety, education, enjoyment and competition.   Shooters use the .177 caliber air rifle. Both males and females ages 11 ½ to 18 can participate, through Legion sponsorship; disabled youth are encouraged to join, as competitive shooting is a sport that creates an equal playing field for all competitors.</p>
<p>Junior Shooting Sports is a three-part program that combines the Basic Marksmanship Course, Qualification Awards and Air Rifle Competition into a well-rounded activity.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Marksmanship Course</strong></p>
<p>The Basic Marksmanship Course, given to Shooting Sports participants, offers comprehensive instruction for beginning shooters with little or no marksmanship experience. Designed for an instructor’s easy use, the course teaches gun safety and marksmanship fundamentals, using short lectures or discussions, followed by hands-on activities.</p>
<p><strong>Qualification Awards</strong></p>
<p>Graduates who want to keep improving their skills can enroll in air-rifle qualification courses provided by the National Rifle Association and the Civilian Marksmanship Programs. These courses offer personal skill-development ladders for shooters to achieve established performance standards.</p>
<p><strong>Air Rifle Competition</strong></p>
<p>The annual 3-Position Junior Air Rifle National Championship is a tournament that begins with postal matches. State and/or regional champions are determined and advance to a qualification round (also a postal match) to determine the athletes who will earn expense-paid trips to compete in the national championship. The national championship is a shoulder-to-shoulder match held each July at the USA Shooting range facilities at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs.</p>
<p>As an organization we are dedicated to providing a positive environment with a strong emphasis on team unity, individual skill improvement, and sound fundamentals. Our coaches encourage team members to excel as both athletes and as students.  We strive to prepare our players for a competitive level in competition, life skills and to work toward the ultimate goal of receiving a college scholarship.  As a side note, WVU has a world class rifle team but we very rarely see WV residents on the team, we aim to change this.</p>
<p>We have been working very hard in our promotion of our programs and to date, we have the full support and approval from the Mineral County Chamber of Commerce, the Mineral County Commissioners, the Mineral County Parks and Rec Department and Mineral County Schools.</p>
<p>We currently have over 100 students registered to take part in the fall of 2018.  As an FYI, it takes $1,650. to fully equip each team member, this is not counting the costs associated with an indoor air rifle range and training venue which will be located in the Keyser City limits.</p>
<p>In an effort to offset the high cost of youth sports, coaches and team members often seek donations and sponsorships from individuals and companies.  Your support will ensure that shooters have the opportunity to compete and to achieve full potential in the sport of Competitive Air Rifle Marksmanship.</p>
<p>As a thank you for providing this much needed support, we will proudly display a banner with your logo and company or individual name in our range facility.  We will also provide your information, listed under the heading;  “Sponsors/Supporters” which will let our teams, parents and our fans of your support in our newsletter, webpage  and our face book page.</p>

VOICI UNE RAPIDE AMORCE À MON PROJET!</strong></u></p><p> </p><p><strong>« En deux mots ou moins, que désirez-vous le plus pour vos enfants ? »</strong></p><p>Les réponses courantes sont « bonheur», « satisfaction », « accomplissement personnel », « équilibre », « santé », « amour », « sens dans la vie »… Plus généralement, on pourrait parler d'un objectif de « Bien-être ».</p><p> </p><p><i>Une autre question pourrait ensuite être mise en parallèle avec la première:</i></p><p> </p><p><strong>« En deux mots ou moins, qu’est-ce que l’école enseigne en premier lieu ? »</strong></p><p>À ceci, la plupart des parents répondent « compétences de réflexion », « réussite », « conformité », « discipline », ou encore « travail »… En soi l’école actuelle forme surtout à la réussite professionnelle.</p><p> </p><p>De ce constat, Martin Seligman met en avant le fait « qu’il n’y a quasiment aucun rapprochement, aucun chevauchement entre les notions issues de ces deux questions ». Nous pourrions pourtant imaginer que l’école, sans compromettre aucune de ces notions, puisse enseigner à la fois les compétences du bien-être et les compétences de la réussite. Nous pourrions imaginer une ""éducation positive"".</p><p> </p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/i92eh8sx45w?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><p>L'ensemble de cette réflexion représente mes premiers pas et mes premières lectures en matière de psychologie positive et d'éducation positive. Depuis, j'ai écrit mon mémoire de master sur cette thématique et je me suis engagé dans un projet de thèse doctorale toujours sur le même sujet.</p><p> </p><p><u><strong>PRÉSENTATION DÉTAILLÉE - TRAVAIL DE RECHERCHE ET FINANCEMENT PARTICIPATIF:</strong></u></p><p> </p><p>Plus précisément, je travaille sur la résilience et les programmes scolaires de résilience. Surtout connue en France grâce à Boris Cyrulnik, la résilience tire ses origines des études de chercheurs anglo-saxons dans les années 60 et 70. Dans les sciences humaines, il s'agit du processus permettant à un individu de rebondir après un événement traumatique plus ou moins sévère, ou après avoir souffert d'une adversité plus chronique (qui perdure dans le temps, environnement néfaste...).</p><p> </p><p>Dans le cadre scolaire, les programmes de résilience se basent sur des principes et théories en psychologie pour aider les élèves à apprendre comment gérer les adversités du quotidien. Entre autres, l'objectif est de leur donner des clés pour mieux gérer le stress immédiat provoqué par l'élément traumatisant, puis pour apprendre à prendre du recul par rapport à celui-ci, pour y trouver une explication causale, pour s'ouvrir à un/des support(s) relationnel(s) extérieur(s), pour enfin rebondir et avancer.</p><p> </p><p>J'ai donc produit mon mémoire de Master lors de l'année scolaire 2016-2017; suite à l'obtention de mon diplôme j'ai repris un protocole plus rigoureux à partir de Septembre 2017 afin de réaliser une revue de littérature (integrative review) en vue d'une première publication dans un journal scientifique international. Ce travail de revue sur les théories générales et concepts de la résilience en psychologie a connu une première période d'analyse et de synthèse des papiers sélectionnés jusqu'à Janvier 2018. À l'heure actuelle la rédaction de l'article touche à sa fin; il devrait bientôt être soumis à un éditeur. En parallèle un deuxième protocole pour un travail de revue similaire a été lancé: l'intérêt sera cette fois centré sur le milieu scolaire et les programmes de résilience à l'école.</p><p> </p><p>Outre l'objectif de publication, l'ensemble de ces recherches forme également le cadre théorique de la thèse.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524588627/ke57ohfwcxeqwc0ppeso.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Néanmoins, l'obtention d'un contrat doctoral pour 3 ans de thèse s'avère être un parcours laborieux. Les enseignants-chercheurs qui me suivent, et moi-même, travaillons à l'élaboration de dossiers et contrats pour financer concrètement mon projet de thèse jusqu'à une soutenance dans quelques années.

VOICI UNE RAPIDE AMORCE À MON PROJET! « En deux mots ou moins, que désirez-vous le plus pour vos enfants ? »Les réponses courantes sont « bonheur», « satisfaction », « accomplissement personnel », « équilibre », « santé », « amour », « sens dans la vie »… Plus généralement, on pourrait parler d'un objectif de « Bien-être ». Une autre question pourrait ensuite être mise en parallèle avec la première: « En deux mots ou moins, qu’est-ce que l’école enseigne en premier lieu ? »À ceci, la plupart des parents répondent « compétences de réflexion », « réussite », « conformité », « discipline », ou encore « travail »… En soi l’école actuelle forme surtout à la réussite professionnelle. De ce constat, Martin Seligman met en avant le fait « qu’il n’y a quasiment aucun rapprochement, aucun chevauchement entre les notions issues de ces deux questions ». Nous pourrions pourtant imaginer que l’école, sans compromettre aucune de ces notions, puisse enseigner à la fois les compétences du bien-être et les compétences de la réussite. Nous pourrions imaginer une ""éducation positive"".  L'ensemble de cette réflexion représente mes premiers pas et mes premières lectures en matière de psychologie positive et d'éducation positive. Depuis, j'ai écrit mon mémoire de master sur cette thématique et je me suis engagé dans un projet de thèse doctorale toujours sur le même sujet. PRÉSENTATION DÉTAILLÉE - TRAVAIL DE RECHERCHE ET FINANCEMENT PARTICIPATIF: Plus précisément, je travaille sur la résilience et les programmes scolaires de résilience. Surtout connue en France grâce à Boris Cyrulnik, la résilience tire ses origines des études de chercheurs anglo-saxons dans les années 60 et 70. Dans les sciences humaines, il s'agit du processus permettant à un individu de rebondir après un événement traumatique plus ou moins sévère, ou après avoir souffert d'une adversité plus chronique (qui perdure dans le temps, environnement néfaste...). Dans le cadre scolaire, les programmes de résilience se basent sur des principes et théories en psychologie pour aider les élèves à apprendre comment gérer les adversités du quotidien. Entre autres, l'objectif est de leur donner des clés pour mieux gérer le stress immédiat provoqué par l'élément traumatisant, puis pour apprendre à prendre du recul par rapport à celui-ci, pour y trouver une explication causale, pour s'ouvrir à un/des support(s) relationnel(s) extérieur(s), pour enfin rebondir et avancer. J'ai donc produit mon mémoire de Master lors de l'année scolaire 2016-2017; suite à l'obtention de mon diplôme j'ai repris un protocole plus rigoureux à partir de Septembre 2017 afin de réaliser une revue de littérature (integrative review) en vue d'une première publication dans un journal scientifique international. Ce travail de revue sur les théories générales et concepts de la résilience en psychologie a connu une première période d'analyse et de synthèse des papiers sélectionnés jusqu'à Janvier 2018. À l'heure actuelle la rédaction de l'article touche à sa fin; il devrait bientôt être soumis à un éditeur. En parallèle un deuxième protocole pour un travail de revue similaire a été lancé: l'intérêt sera cette fois centré sur le milieu scolaire et les programmes de résilience à l'école. Outre l'objectif de publication, l'ensemble de ces recherches forme également le cadre théorique de la thèse.  Néanmoins, l'obtention d'un contrat doctoral pour 3 ans de thèse s'avère être un parcours laborieux. Les enseignants-chercheurs qui me suivent, et moi-même, travaillons à l'élaboration de dossiers et contrats pour financer concrètement mon projet de thèse jusqu'à une soutenance dans quelques années. Ces démarches devraient aboutir à un contrat doctoral au début 2019. Le financement participatif s'appliquerait donc pour le reste de cette année 2018 afin de m'aider à couvrir mes frais d'hébergement et divers frais liés à mes déplacements et au travail de recherche. Ceux-ci deviennent difficiles à soutenir personnellement. ME CONNAITRE UN PEU PLUS: Clément Métais, 25 ans.>>  https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Clement_Me...>> (Clément Métais sur LinkedIn) Après avoir terminé 2 années dans le milieu technique (IUT génie électrique), je me suis changé les idées lors d'une année en Australie, pour finalement me réorienter vers des études dans l'enseignement (EPS).

It has four times or twice the available memory of those models. It supports 64-bit ARMv8 where as ASUS Tinker Board and ODROID-XU4 only support 32-bit ARMv7. Onboard PCI-E high speed expansion interface enables high speed peripherals that are not possible on those other boards.</p><p>What is the difference between this and a ROCKPro64 or ROCK960? - While both of those are based on the same RK3399 SoC, Renegade Elite is designed using higher performance components. The board layout is optimized for full size cooling and better heat dissipation. Firefly team also specializes in Rockchip solutions and provides more software support than other vendors.</p><p>What is the difference between this and the original Renegade? - The original Renegade is designed as a power efficient device using at most 5W. It uses less power than a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ while offering higher performance. Renegade Elite is designed from the ground up as a high performance solution using up to 15W. Power consumption is roughly triple that of the Renegade so this new board is suitable for applications that require higher performance at the expense of more energy consumption.</p><p>How is shipping handled? - All products are shipped out of Shenzhen, China and may be subject to import duties and taxes imposed by your regional or local government. If it is subject to such regulations, it is your responsibility to pay it in order to receive the merchandise.</p></div>","Who we are:Libre Computer (Project) was created with the goal of commoditizing general-purpose computing platforms through Free Open Source Software (FOSS).

All of our platforms receive long term support in excess of five years.Firefly (Team) is a core Libre Computer partner based in Zhongshan, China. With nearly ten years of hardware and software development expertise, the Firefly team is the top independent design house (IDH) for Rockchip-based solutions. They first brought the Firefly RK3399 platform to the market nearly two years ago and continue to deliver reliable performant solutions for design customers.Overview of Renegade Elite:Renegade Elite is a low-profile high-performance 4K-capable 64-bit ARM computer with 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM capable of running desktop-class Linux based operating systems like Debian, Arch, Ubuntu, Fedora, OpenSUSE, Android 8.1, and more. At 1.19 cm (0.47 inches), it is one of the thinnest SBCs on the market as well as being one of the fastest compared to Cortex-A53 boards like the Raspberry Pi 3 or Cortex-A17 boards like the ASUS Tinker Board. It is supported by upstream Linux which means that software support for hardware capabilities will continuously improve unlike other platforms that rely on proprietary vendor board support package (BSP).Renegade Elite features a rich set of standards-compliant external interfaces. There are two USB 3.0 Type-C ports featuring DisplayPort Alternate Mode for driving 4K monitors (only one can be used in DisplayPort Alternate mode at a time). The rear Type-C port also features support for USB Power Delivery which enables single cable power, 4K video, and peripheral connectivity. HDMI 2.0 with 4K is also featured and can be driven simultaneously with DisplayPort, Embedded DisplayPort, or MIPI DSI.For server application, the board offers UEFI-capable GUI bootloader, onboard headers for 802.3at (30W) PoE+ mezzanine support, and battery backed real-time-clock (RTC). High-speed header expansion with 4-lane PCI-E 2.1 enables SSD and SATA mezzanines while low-speed header expansion support USB, SDIO, UART, and I2C mezzanine. eMMC 5.x connector supports module with up to 128GB of storage.For product integration, Renegade Elite supports Embedded DisplayPort, MIPI-DSI, MIPI-CSI, and MIPI-CSI/DSI dual role interfaces. Paired with stereo vision cameras or displays, Renegade Elite becomes an ideal platform for virtual reality, artificial intelligence, stereo computer-vision, heterogeneous compute, GPGPU, convolutional neural-networks, OpenCL, TensorFlow, and Caffe.Renegade Elite Expansion MezzaninesThe expansion mezzanine for Renegade Elite comes in two flavors: Lite and Advanced.Lite Expansion Mezzanine Features:
M.2 M-Key Connector with 4 Lane PCI-Express for SSDs and High Speed PeripheralsSupports 22mm x 30mm/42mm/60mm/80mm/110mm Lengths

M.2 E-Key Connector with SDIO and USB 2.0 for Wireless Expansion (No PCI-E!)Supports 22mm x 30mm Length

The Advanced Expansion Mezzanine has all of the capabilities of the Lite Expansion Mezzanine along with three additional features:
Lithium Polymer Battery Support via XT30 Connector
Battery Backup and UPS functionality
25W Power-over-Ethernet+ (IEEE 802.3at) supportSupport for charging battery

The advanced mezzanine allows Renegade Elite to be used in situations with unreliable power and/or Ethernet only applications. That means you do not have to run separate power wires to Renegade Elite.RK3399 Key Specification:
Dual performance out-of-order ARM Cortex-A72 cores
Quad power-optimized in-order ARM Cortex-A53 cores
Quad OpenGL ES 3.2/Vulkan/OpenCL 1.2 ARM Mali-T860 cores
4GB LPDDR4 SDRAM
128Mb SPI NOR for GUI bootloader
120mm x 72mm x 11.9mm
Project Status:The board has been fully tested and the PCBs are undergoing production. We expect manufacturing to be completed and fulfilled by late August. We will slowly release more demonstration videos as we free more time for filming. If there's something you have a question about or not sure on, don't hesitate to leave a comment.Frequently Asked Questions:Do you have a model with more than 4GB? - No, RK3399 is limited to 4GB of addressable memory.What is the difference between this and a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ or ASUS Tinker Board or ODRIOD-XU4? - This is 4 times as fast as a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, twice as fast a ASUS Tinker Board, and 35% faster than an ODROID-XU4. It has four times or twice the available memory of those models. It supports 64-bit ARMv8 where as ASUS Tinker Board and ODROID-XU4 only support 32-bit ARMv7. Onboard PCI-E high speed expansion interface enables high speed peripherals that are not possible on those other boards.What is the difference between this and a ROCKPro64 or ROCK960? - While both of those are based on the same RK3399 SoC, Renegade Elite is designed using higher performance components. The board layout is optimized for full size cooling and better heat dissipation. Firefly team also specializes in Rockchip solutions and provides more software support than other vendors.What is the difference between this and the original Renegade? - The original Renegade is designed as a power efficient device using at most 5W. It uses less power than a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ while offering higher performance. Renegade Elite is designed from the ground up as a high performance solution using up to 15W. Power consumption is roughly triple that of the Renegade so this new board is suitable for applications that require higher performance at the expense of more energy consumption.How is shipping handled? - All products are shipped out of Shenzhen, China and may be subject to import duties and taxes imposed by your regional or local government. If it is subject to such regulations, it is your responsibility to pay it in order to receive the merchandise.",4.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Our director holds a Master's Degree in Global Finance, Trade, and Economic Integration and has worked in economic development and entrepreneurship for over 10 years. Through this campaign we will be able to hire digital experts needed to execute this project. Other Ways You Can HelpJust because you can't give, doesn't mean you can't help! We'd love your support!

<p><b>Leaders In Community (LiC) –
Kickstarter Campaign – Save our charity!<br/>
<br/>
Summary - Who are we?</b></p>
<p>We are an entirely youth-led charity, we started 10 years ago to provide positive opportunities for children and young
people aged from 5 up to 25 in the Tower Hamlets area. Our work is primarily
focused on youth leadership and positive engagement. This is because we live in
an area of East London which has the highest rate of child poverty in the UK.
According to the Index of Multiple Deprivation, our young people make up 10% of
the most deprived within the country. 49% of the children grow up in poverty.
Over half of the local population are from a black or minority ethnic
background and a large number are classified as NEET (Not in
Education, Employment, or Training).</p><p><span>Over the 10 years we have helped 1000s of young people each year make positive choices about thier future, we have supported  young people build thier lives after being in prison and those under achieving aim high. We need your help to carry this on!</span></p>
<p>Our founder Momtaz Ajid, has been involved in the organisation as a
young person. Having grown up in the local area, she understood the challenges faced by young people from the area and set up this voluntary organisation in 2006 to give
other likeminded individuals from similar backgrounds the opportunity to build
skills, confidence for employment. </p>
<p>What started out as a youth network group, sharing employment advice and opportunities for young people, became a campaigning group raising awareness about young people’s barriers to employment or education. We are still the only youth led charity in Tower Hamlets, working predominately with marginalised and disenfranchised group of people. <br/></p><p>10 years on, we
now deliver a weekly programme of activities, providing young people with the creative opportunities, skills and motivation to develop themselves and their peers into confident and inspirational leaders within the broader Tower Hamlets area.<br/></p><p><b>Our activities are:</b>
</p><p>- Under 12s programme: Ballet, Guitar classes, and Violin tuition part of our Centre
for creative expression.</p>
<p>- Peer Leadership programme, offering employability guidance and skills
training to young people aged 16-25, with specialist support for those out of
education, training or employment. This also includes mentoring, volunteering
and an opportunity to become a trustee at LiC.</p>
<p>- Food for Thought mentoring- bringing benefits to both young people
15-20 year olds and the employee mentors who take part. Participants report
that the Food for Thought sessions have been a huge success, enabling more than
50 young people from difficult backgrounds to ‘cook up a life plan’ with advice
and support from warm hearted and knowledgeable employees.</p>
<p>- Music Leaders- is a music development programme for young people aged
12-19 to learn live band music skills, record their music and develop their
artistry skills. </p>
<p>-Opportunities for young people to explore the arts, media, sports and
the enterprise hub (for all ages).</p>
<p><b>What we need</b></p>
<p>We need to raise £50,000 to fund our activities above for the next
1-2 years. The charity currently employs only 1 full time member of staff and 2 part time
staff. We heavily rely on the work of our 25 volunteers to help us meet the
needs of the local young people.Without the dedication of our staff and volunteers we just couldn't function. <br/></p><p>  <br/>

<p><b>If we do not reach our target.</b></p>
<p>We would be devastated if we don’t meet our target. It will mean our 10
year old charity will likely close down, leaving destitute young people with nowhere
to turn to. This could cause some of our young people joining gangs, not
meeting their aspirations and potentially causing social problems to the Tower
Hamlets community.</p>
<p><b>If we exceed our target.</b></p>
<p>This would be truly amazing and it will mean that we will be able to
continue for at least 2 years, carrying on with providing award winning youth
provision to the many young people in need of the support guidance. It will allow
us to expand our services and provide niche work where it is needed, such as
working with ex-offenders, or those leaving care.</p>
<p><b>The impact of your donations</b></p>
<p>Your donations will help us continue to deliver learning that meets the
needs of our users, and focus on addressing barriers to achievement. E.g. You will support the delivery of our
participatory music workshop, which brings positive personal and social
benefits to the young people who take part. Our classes are heavily
oversubscribed with waiting lists, with children and young people coming
together from all walks of life, accessing instruments that are otherwise too
expensive to try. </p>
<p><br/>
<b>Did you know?<br/>
In Tower Hamlets, nearly 1 in 7 children in reception (4- to 5-year-olds)
and over 1 in 4 of children in year 6 (10- to 11-year-olds) are obese. We have
the fifth highest proportion of obese 10-to 11-year-olds in London and the
sixth highest in the country. <br/></b></p><b>
</b><p>Similarly there are groups of young people who do not reach expected
levels of educational attainment which impacts on their future employment
prospects. Traditional programmes at school can have limited impact on some
young people and this is the case with the young people we see.</p>
<p><b>Our work</b></p>
<p>Our work provides critical front line service for children, young
people and families to ensure we reduce these barriers.The impact of our work cannot always been quantified by
statistics, our young people face numerous challenges and barriers. From low
educational attainment, childhood obesity to mental health – all of which we
help!<br/>
</p><p>In 2015- 84 children and young people took part in our music workshops.
By taking part in these sessions, we aim to
improve the children and young people’s learning, confidence, health and social
development as well as wellbeing.  Getting
involved in these programmes gives them space, gets them out of the home and
promoting self-confidence.  The skills
the children gain here are all transferable and will enable the children to
feel a sense of achievement and self-worth. </p>
<p>In 2015 we saw: </p>

<div>Already our KIPPsters read, on average, 1 million words a week (and we have just surpassed 75 million for this school year)! Every student knows exactly what level they are reading on, and they can tell you what their reading goal for the future is. We have reading blocks every day scheduled just for joyful, independent reading. Their biggest complaint (as you'll see in the video above) is that they don't have enough *choice* of texts. After all, in middle-income homes the ratio of books per child is 13:1 where as in low-income neighborhoods, the ratio is 1 book for every 300 children.</div>

</div></div>","Summary
Founded in 2012, KIPP Memphis Academy Middle opened its doors to a small 5th grade class and has since grown to serve 395 students in the Hyde Park neighborhood of North Memphis. 96% of our students qualify for Title 1 free and reduced meals, and the overwhelming majority come from low-income households.
As our first 8th grade class gets ready to graduate in 2016, we’ve realized how our school has outgrown our old library system. Before we had reached our full enrollment, English teachers were relied upon to provide books to their students in small “classroom libraries.” This was an extremely difficult task, considering the demands of instructing English in a region where less than 30% of students read on or above their grade level.In the Fall of 2016, KMAM will invest in 7,000 new, protected books that will be leveled meticulously to meet our students' needs. While donors often love to give us used and dollar-bin books, these tend to fall apart quickly and aren't the most popular or age-appropriate books that we'd need to compel our students to be lifelong readers. We are asking you to donate to our library effort so that we can buy the most interesting and long-lasting texts, because our students deserve equal opportunity to great books! 

   What We Need The American Library Association recommends that any school library contain a ratio of *at least* 25:1 books per student. At KMAM, we currently have 6 books for every 1 KIPPster enrolled. This is far below what our students need! 
7,000 books would bring our ratio up to about 15:1. 
Each leveled text costs about $4, while binding and protecting the book costs anywhere from $5 to $8 on top of that. The more we raise, the more books we can obtain! 



    The Impact
A school library would seriously increase student literacy and performance in nearly every subject:


Studies show that just the presence of a central library in schools can boost student achievement by up to 23%.
Students who read for pleasure score 2x higher on state assessments than those who do not.
Students are 3x more likely to read for pleasure if they have a wide choice of appropriate and high-interest texts.                                                                                                                                                                      


Already our KIPPsters read, on average, 1 million words a week (and we have just surpassed 75 million for this school year)! Every student knows exactly what level they are reading on, and they can tell you what their reading goal for the future is. We have reading blocks every day scheduled just for joyful, independent reading. Their biggest complaint (as you'll see in the video above) is that they don't have enough *choice* of texts. After all, in middle-income homes the ratio of books per child is 13:1 where as in low-income neighborhoods, the ratio is 1 book for every 300 children.

<p>I’ve been on the Wendy Williams Show, and have cheffed publicly or privately for some of MY favorite celebrities- and perhaps yours too- I teach youth programs at Culinary Institutes globally, produced two seasons of a cooking show for Canadian tv called “The Virgin Gourmet”, and have been curating some of my most unique and popular USVI Sweet And Savory recipes to make them available through a multimedia Interactive “course” and cookbook called #SweetAndSavory!</p>

Letztes Jahr beschloss ich, auf Geburtstagsgeschenke zu verzichten und mir statt dessen Geld geben zu lassen - davon konnte ich dann 5x Ziegen an arme, nepalesische Familien übergeben. 
Aus dieser Idee heraus fliege ich nun kommenden Mai ( auf eigene Kosten ) nach Meghauli, Nepal, um dort armen Familien so viele Ziegen wie möglich zu finanzieren. 
Ziegen? Warum Ziegen?
Ziegen hatten schon immer den Ruf von nervenden und Ärger machenden Biestern. Doch sie tragen in vielen Ländern - so auch in Nepal - zur unmittelbaren Ernährungssicherung bei.  Ziegen sind besonders widerstandsfähig, können sich auch von verdorrten Pflanzen ernähren und so Zeiten mit geringem Niederschlag und wenig Futter trotzen. Ziegen gegen Armut
Eine Ziege kann in Nepal eine ganze Familie ernähren. Ihre Milch ist überaus nahrhaft und fördert die gesunde Entwicklung der Kinder. Einige Familien verkaufen Milch und Käse, den sie selbst nicht benötigen. Mit jenem Geld können sie Medikamente oder Schulbücher für ihre Kinder kaufen. Und noch mehr: Ausscheidungen können als Düngemittel genutzt werden - und der Nachwuchs der Ziegen gegen Dinge wie teuere Werkzeuge eingetauscht werden!  Bereits mit 30 Euro schenken Sie somit einer Familie eine stabile Lebensgrundlage! Nepal Fakten:

68 % der Erwerbstätigen in Nepal arbeiten in der Landwirtschaft

<h3>The CHI Method</h3>
<p>Help me empower women, one habit at a time! (Unique Valentine's Day Gift, Fellas!)</p>
<p>In December, I had my <strong>fifth</strong> <strong>surgery in</strong> <strong>less than five years</strong>.</p>
<p>My adult life has been riddled with illnesses from PCOS to Endometriosis to most recently a life-altering diagnosis of Fibromyalgia. Despite these challenges, I still work full time at a Community Mental Health Center while balancing being a mom, wife, and caretaker of our home and pets.</p>
<p>As I laid in bed, recovering from my surgery, I found myself unhealthy and unhappy - and impulsively purchased my hundredth diet system after seeing my timelines filled with people's New Years' resolutions, pictures of successful people on the system, dreaming about wanting my own weight loss, and a special ""one-time"" offer.  </p>

<p><strong>$300 later...</strong></p>
<p>I am waiting for my shipment and instantly feeling regret. I realized I had hopped from identifying a problem - straight to a solution. I had taken no time to assess why the last 99 times had failed and what I required to be successful. I was just throwing money at the problem, hoping this solution might be the one that finally sticks. Sound familiar? </p>
<p>I thought to myself - why am I successful in my business life but can't tackle my own weight? That’s when I realized I use proven continuous improvement models in business. I’ve personally seen the success they bring about in changing companies, cultures, processes, products and systems. </p>
<p><strong>Why had I not taken these successful methods and applied them to my own individual growth? </strong></p>
<p>The issue with many of these corporate systems is they typically have a narrow and specialized focus: Lean and Six Sigma focus heavily on the manufacturing world. Agile Methodology focuses on software teams. The Snowball Method focuses on paying off your debt. Cognitive Behavioral Analysis is usually done in Individual or Group Therapy. You get the idea.</p>

<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I am currently paying all costs out of pocket, including 3 super talented lady soloprenuers who are building their own freelancing business. I believe in the Fight for $15 and want to be able to pay living wages for their hard work during our Beta Team Campaign.</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I need to be able to market and promote the Beta Team Campaign so we can get a big, diverse group of women with big goals they need help achieving.  I hope you will help me spread the word, but some paid advertising goes a LONG way.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">In an ideal world, I would love the freedom to be able to transition my time and efforts full-time to ChiCoach.

I'm hoping to take lemons and make lemonade, as I'd much rather help others and run a business than eventually reach the point I need to be on disability.)</span></li>

In an ideal world, I would love the freedom to be able to transition my time and efforts full-time to ChiCoach. (I actually LOVE my 8-5 position, but my Fibromyalgia has made it very difficult to perform on strict schedules and stress tends to make my flare-ups worse. I'm hoping to take lemons and make lemonade, as I'd much rather help others and run a business than eventually reach the point I need to be on disability.)

​Here's what you can get:

All Beta Team Members will receive a FREE electronic copy of The Book of CHI and their ACHIVment Challenge Workbook. 
Our contributors will be able to earn additional rewards such as an exclusive badge and title in our ChiCoach Community.
Access to a VIP Grop for our ChiCoach Advanced(+) Founders, which provides you with early access to limited quantity or special offers.
One-on-One Coaching Lesson with the creator of The CHI Method.
A printed copy of The Book of CHI.
A printed copy of the ACHIVment Challenge Workbook. 


Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute, that doesn't mean you can't help:

Joining our Beta Team is completely FREE.  You can apply now!
I'm an introvert who could REALLY use your help with social media love.  Could you help me make some noise?
Please share the Beta Team opportunity with women you know! 

Thanks in advance for your support!",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<li>Owner &amp; Master Canner, Lyn Deardorff, has over 40 years of preserving experience plus more than six years of teaching various preserving classes in the Atlanta, North Georgia &amp; Nashville areas — and years of retail management &amp; financial management experience. </li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">The Atlanta area has very few choices for learning the various lost arts in food.  Our new Learning Kitchen will provide a complete space for learning, including an area with class-related supplies available for purchase.</span>
</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Our pop-ups are designed to serve as an ""incubator"" for fledgling businesses and instructors to try out products and methods.  </span></li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">We'll provide healthy, organic preserved foods for sale.</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We'll be adding a host of Atlanta instructors in the various food arts that complement our class line-up, offering a way for knowledgeable cooks &amp; crafters to share their skills while earning a competitive market fee.</span></li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need </h3><ul>
<li>We require funding to do our initial build out. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">We have identified a location for our business in a fun, market environment—the nearly 100-year-old Sweet Auburn Curb Market—located in a very accessible area of downtown Atlanta. (The unfinished space is shown above).  It has ample space to provide a full teaching kitchen plus space for pop-ups, demos and events.  Additionally, we'll have a retail section comprised of all the necessary preserving and related tools &amp; supplies that we can personally recommend for the home preserver and related workshops. </span>

<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We are looking for funding for capital equipment purchases including cooktops &amp; ovens, cabinetry, basic kitchen supplies and for our build-out with shelving and related construction.

</div></div>","Short Summary
Owner & Master Canner, Lyn Deardorff, has over 40 years of preserving experience plus more than six years of teaching various preserving classes in the Atlanta, North Georgia & Nashville areas — and years of retail management & financial management experience. 

The Atlanta area has very few choices for learning the various lost arts in food.  Our new Learning Kitchen will provide a complete space for learning, including an area with class-related supplies available for purchase.

Our pop-ups are designed to serve as an ""incubator"" for fledgling businesses and instructors to try out products and methods.  

We'll provide healthy, organic preserved foods for sale.

We'll be adding a host of Atlanta instructors in the various food arts that complement our class line-up, offering a way for knowledgeable cooks & crafters to share their skills while earning a competitive market fee.
What We Need 
We require funding to do our initial build out. We have identified a location for our business in a fun, market environment—the nearly 100-year-old Sweet Auburn Curb Market—located in a very accessible area of downtown Atlanta. (The unfinished space is shown above).  It has ample space to provide a full teaching kitchen plus space for pop-ups, demos and events.  Additionally, we'll have a retail section comprised of all the necessary preserving and related tools & supplies that we can personally recommend for the home preserver and related workshops. 

We are looking for funding for capital equipment purchases including cooktops & ovens, cabinetry, basic kitchen supplies and for our build-out with shelving and related construction. We already have sinks and a refrigerator in place. We would like to begin purchasing a small start-up inventory of retail items.
What You Get & The Impact


Your perks for contributions include class coupons & events offerings, jars of our organic preserved foods, a customized Preserving Class and a space at our Celebration Table!

Our community will gain students who learn food skills to prepare healthy & tasty meals for their family, to preserve their garden production and to take advantage of local farmers' markets seasonal food to preserve for year-around use.  It will enable them to avoid packaged, prepared foods that contain preservatives, chemicals, heavy sugars & salts, artificial colors and flavors, and so much more.

All our classes will be offered for reasonable fees.  We'll be offering low-cost classes & workshops as well as discounted and/or free classes for college students or those unable to afford the fees.  We'll also be offering intern possibilities for culinary and other students interested in learning these ""lost arts"".
