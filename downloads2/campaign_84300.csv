<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As I wrote in the Overview, I have been an enthusiast of this artist for many years, and this opportunity came up VERY suddenly.  I'm a full-time student and I seriously JUST relocated my home residence and am totally tapped out:</p>
<ul>
<li>His style is very much not only in line with mine, it's one of my main inspirations.</li>
<li>It's important to my current career goals; I have my 5th audition with ""The Voice"" in Dallas, TX at the end of June.</li>
<li>The magnitude of what I will achieve in this will be realized in the album I'm working on and in live performances that are ongoing.  Album is due in 2020.</li>
<li>This is SERIOUSLY a life dream.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>I need $1650 for these 5 days of classes.  I will get one on one direction with Gino and walk away with a completed piano track designed specifically and solely for me and played by Gino.</li>
<li>Anyone who contributes will get a digital copy of this track!</li>
<li>If the entire goal is not reached the funds will go toward the album project.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Previous projects have been successful as with the first Indiegogo project allowed ""No Father"" to be created - the lead off single from ""Worth The Wait"", achieving a #6 Chart Position on the Austin Pop Charts on Reverbnation.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>What qualifies me to be asking for this is that I'm a bit more mature, but know the value of reaching for a tangible dream with an established name, as well as the value that name holds.  It's a ""legit"" deal.  I also have spoken with his saxophone player many times in the past regarding their musicianship and set up - he's an awesome musician on his own right.  I'm currently working on my Bachelor of Science degree on audio production and engineering maintaining a very high GPA.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about this campaign.  I only have two days - literally.  There are only 2 spots left.</li>
<li>Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Les Enfants d'Orphée is a Boston-based chamber ensemble dedicated to the performance of French baroque vocal music. We present innovative performances that make French baroque music immediate and relevant to audiences of every age while giving voice to excellent performers and little known composers. We have welcomed hundreds of audience members ranging from school children from Montréal to senior citizens of the Boston community.  Our performers are among the brightest rising stars in the field of baroque music, and director Ian Pomerantz numbers among the leading interpreters of Sephardic Jewish music. Our upcoming collaboration with the Kol Arev choir of Hebrew College will be the highlight of our third performance season.</p>
<p>Hebrew College is a pluralistic and trans-denominational degree-granting institution in Newton, Massachusetts. Our collaboration with Kol Arev choir will bridge and engage Boston-area communities in a conversation about the importance of tolerance through music from a time in which the future of the Jewish community of France was uncertain.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise $3000 by February 1st, 2018.  Your donation will be used to pay the fourteen performers from Les Enfants d’Orphée who will be involved in the concert. It will also enable us to offer free admission to children under the age of 15. As a sponsor, your name or business will be recognized in our program.  </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Our Campaign</strong></p>
<p>Our Climate Rock Opera; ""<a href=""http://madmen-and-dreamers.com/TheNatureofMan.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Nature of Man</a>"" can change the national conversation about climate change in this country. Our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Madmen-and-Dreamers-126910890109/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">band Facebook</a> has 42,000 followers (and rising). The vast majority (93%) are between the ages of 13 and 34 (our <a href=""https://twitter.com/madmendreamers"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a> is pushing 10k). We hope to use this show to ignite that group by touring the show through colleges, starting in the NYC tri-state area. We want to involve students in the production and bring in environmental groups to help them get organized and moving in defense of their future. Once trained, they can peacefully address local issues and legislation by working against any representatives who don't work in the future's best interest, and working for those who do.</p>
<p>As we tour the show, we would leave these working groups behind us at every school. It would exponentially grow the climate movement with the very people who will have to face it.</p>
<p>Any tour is an expensive undertaking, which is why we're going to lay all our cards right on the table for you. Full disclosure. Below you'll find the required budget for the first 18 shows of the tour.</p>
<p>If we get the funds during our initial effort, it'll be wonderful and we'll go right into production! Whatever we get in excess of our posted budget, will go directly into enhancing the show (set design, lights, sound, projections, etc). In this biz, <strong>the bigger the budget, the better the show</strong> (and therefore the show's reach)!</p>
<p>Because our show is a live experience, our perks are also in the form of experiences. Check them out!</p>

<p><i><strong>What your donation will accomplish:</strong></i></p>
<p>We all know that our government is too compromised to act against climate change in a way that would actually preserve a livable climate for everyone. They need to hear your voice. Loud and consistently. I remember the Vietnam war and Watergate protests that brought down a government. I remember Woodstock and Kent State. I remember Martin Luther King Jr. and the power those peaceful movements represented. That power is still within us. That power is within you. Bernie Sanders' primary campaign showed it for the world to see.</p>
<p>The show will motivate change and you will have contributed to that change. You will help us show students and young people that their voice has immense power in American politics and if every school we play has a dedicated group of activists working on local problems and supporting local politicians who are voting in the future's best interests, I believe we can change the climate conversation in this country. I believe that we can turn the tide against those who are only trying to enrich themselves and their donors. I believe that we can steer our path toward a future filled with hope. </p>
<p><i><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></i></p>
<p>It's a big show. The logistics of moving and performing it are going to be very important. When we were touring The Children of Children, we learned to anticipate and plan for potential problems (and we had some whoppers) . Everything has to be planned out and everyone has to understand their roles. It has to be run almost like an army.</p>
<p>Will there be challenges? Absolutely. It's unavoidable. The difference between success and failure is how you look at the problem. If you see it as an opportunity, you've already won. When my children were young I used to tell them that there was an opportunity in every disaster. The trick was finding it. I also taught them how to work a problem; consider the simplest (and least expensive) solution first.</p>
<p>And always have a fallback plan.</p>
<p><i><strong>If you cannot donate . . . </strong></i></p>
<p>The importance of getting the word out cannot be overstated. A ""buzz"" is absolutely necessary for success. You can help generate one. Talk up what we're doing and why. Start with those closest to you; your family. Work outward from there.</p>

They are a great way of telling the world what we're up to!</div><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The Creators</strong></p><p>The Nature of Man was written and conceived by Mark A. Durstewitz, Christine Hull and Mario Renes.</p><p><strong>Mark A. Durstewitz</strong> is the founding member of Madmen and Dreamers and has been a keyboard player/composer/producer and audio engineer for most of his life. He wrote and scored our fist rock opera; ""The Children of Children"" and produced its entire regional tour of all the way up and through a limited, Off-Broadway run at the Bleecker Street Theater in NYC during the winter of 2008/2009.</p><p>Mark and Christine were also part of The People's Climate March with Mark being the stage manager at the Javitz Center at the end of the march, and Chris bringing the talent through the NYC subway system (long story). It was an amazing day and we met so many cool people.  Mark got a huge hug from Peter Yarrow (Peter, Paul and Mary), which he will treasure for the rest of his life.</p><p><strong>Christine Hull</strong> is a writer/composer and an actress/singer/dancer. She is a published poet with a Bachelor's Degree in Musical Theatre from the Hartt School of Music. She has appeared on New York and regional stages, as well as in film, television and commercials. She earned Outstanding Female Supporting Lead for her role in Starting Here, Starting Now. She wrote lyrics, melodies and harmonies for The Children of Children and originated the role of Mother. She recorded the concept albums for both The Children of Children and Remembrance (now called The Nature of Man) and has been the vocal coach for all recordings and performances of both projects. Her acting experience brings depth to the character development and story-boarding process that is the hallmark of Madmen and Dreamers.</p><p><strong>Mario Renes</strong> is classically trained on the piano, woodwind and brass instruments and could not ignore the call to write music and perform. He became proficient with the electric bass, being fond of the low end in music. Playing rock ‘n roll in bands that eventually played originals, led Mario into recording studios. While learning the process of recording, Mario met studio owners and engineers. Two of the engineers he worked with started Indie Music Productions. Mario eventually became a partner. In this company, Mario wrote music; performed as a studio musician; was an assistant engineer; and participated in music pre-production and production. After hitting a slow period, Mark Durstewitz (an old college friend) looking for a bass player to record a rock opera, contacted Mario. With this recording gig, Mario became Madmen and Dreamers’ bass player; co-produced “The Children of Children” (the rock opera) and became part owner and Secretary of MadElf Productions. Mario has since moved on to other projects.</p></div>","First, our Social Media! Follow Us!

What your donation will accomplish:
We all know that our government is too compromised to act against climate change in a way that would actually preserve a livable climate for everyone. They need to hear your voice. Loud and consistently. I remember the Vietnam war and Watergate protests that brought down a government. I remember Woodstock and Kent State. I remember Martin Luther King Jr. and the power those peaceful movements represented. That power is still within us. That power is within you. Bernie Sanders' primary campaign showed it for the world to see.
The show will motivate change and you will have contributed to that change. You will help us show students and young people that their voice has immense power in American politics and if every school we play has a dedicated group of activists working on local problems and supporting local politicians who are voting in the future's best interests, I believe we can change the climate conversation in this country. I believe that we can turn the tide against those who are only trying to enrich themselves and their donors. I believe that we can steer our path toward a future filled with hope. 
Risks & Challenges
It's a big show. The logistics of moving and performing it are going to be very important. When we were touring The Children of Children, we learned to anticipate and plan for potential problems (and we had some whoppers) . Everything has to be planned out and everyone has to understand their roles. It has to be run almost like an army.
Will there be challenges? Absolutely. It's unavoidable. The difference between success and failure is how you look at the problem. If you see it as an opportunity, you've already won. When my children were young I used to tell them that there was an opportunity in every disaster. The trick was finding it. I also taught them how to work a problem; consider the simplest (and least expensive) solution first.
And always have a fallback plan.
If you cannot donate . . . 
The importance of getting the word out cannot be overstated. A ""buzz"" is absolutely necessary for success. You can help generate one. Talk up what we're doing and why. Start with those closest to you; your family. Work outward from there.
Please also use the Indiegogo share tools you find on our page! They are a great way of telling the world what we're up to! The CreatorsThe Nature of Man was written and conceived by Mark A. Durstewitz, Christine Hull and Mario Renes.Mark A. Durstewitz is the founding member of Madmen and Dreamers and has been a keyboard player/composer/producer and audio engineer for most of his life. He wrote and scored our fist rock opera; ""The Children of Children"" and produced its entire regional tour of all the way up and through a limited, Off-Broadway run at the Bleecker Street Theater in NYC during the winter of 2008/2009.Mark and Christine were also part of The People's Climate March with Mark being the stage manager at the Javitz Center at the end of the march, and Chris bringing the talent through the NYC subway system (long story). It was an amazing day and we met so many cool people.  Mark got a huge hug from Peter Yarrow (Peter, Paul and Mary), which he will treasure for the rest of his life.Christine Hull is a writer/composer and an actress/singer/dancer. She is a published poet with a Bachelor's Degree in Musical Theatre from the Hartt School of Music. She has appeared on New York and regional stages, as well as in film, television and commercials. She earned Outstanding Female Supporting Lead for her role in Starting Here, Starting Now. She wrote lyrics, melodies and harmonies for The Children of Children and originated the role of Mother. She recorded the concept albums for both The Children of Children and Remembrance (now called The Nature of Man) and has been the vocal coach for all recordings and performances of both projects. Her acting experience brings depth to the character development and story-boarding process that is the hallmark of Madmen and Dreamers.Mario Renes is classically trained on the piano, woodwind and brass instruments and could not ignore the call to write music and perform. He became proficient with the electric bass, being fond of the low end in music. Playing rock ‘n roll in bands that eventually played originals, led Mario into recording studios. While learning the process of recording, Mario met studio owners and engineers. Two of the engineers he worked with started Indie Music Productions. Mario eventually became a partner. In this company, Mario wrote music; performed as a studio musician; was an assistant engineer; and participated in music pre-production and production. After hitting a slow period, Mark Durstewitz (an old college friend) looking for a bass player to record a rock opera, contacted Mario. With this recording gig, Mario became Madmen and Dreamers’ bass player; co-produced “The Children of Children” (the rock opera) and became part owner and Secretary of MadElf Productions. Mario has since moved on to other projects.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>After playing over 100 intimate home concerts around the world, Jesse Macht has again been invited to play in homes throughout Australia!</strong></p>
<p><strong>After the immense success of the campaigns in the past for such a refreshing unique concert experience, we're yet again making an unconventional proposal to help make it happen this coming spring.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We are hoping that Jesse's fan-base, potential hosts, past hosts, and other friends and family who have already experienced the intimacy and power of these home concerts will REQUEST and/or PAY IT FORWARD and support this new venture. </strong></p>
<p><strong>We're looking for guaranteed reservations and contributions to help CROWD-FUND these concerts for new fans who may not be able to cover the costs of the concert on their own (and will also help defray Jesse's travel expenses). </strong></p>
<p><strong>YES THIS IS A BIG ASK - HELP SOMEONE ELSE HAVE A CONCERT! We are reaching out on behalf of new audiences for Jesse Macht who want the experience of a home concert, but have the challenge of getting him across the PACIFIC.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This tour is called the ""SHARE A STORY"" Home Concert tour. One of the most compelling parts of the home concert experience is when Jesse and the audiences begin to talk about the stories behind the songs, and inevitably conversations begin between he and the audience.

After playing over 100 intimate home concerts around the world, Jesse Macht has again been invited to play in homes throughout Australia!
After the immense success of the campaigns in the past for such a refreshing unique concert experience, we're yet again making an unconventional proposal to help make it happen this coming spring.
We are hoping that Jesse's fan-base, potential hosts, past hosts, and other friends and family who have already experienced the intimacy and power of these home concerts will REQUEST and/or PAY IT FORWARD and support this new venture. 
We're looking for guaranteed reservations and contributions to help CROWD-FUND these concerts for new fans who may not be able to cover the costs of the concert on their own (and will also help defray Jesse's travel expenses). 
YES THIS IS A BIG ASK - HELP SOMEONE ELSE HAVE A CONCERT! We are reaching out on behalf of new audiences for Jesse Macht who want the experience of a home concert, but have the challenge of getting him across the PACIFIC.
This tour is called the ""SHARE A STORY"" Home Concert tour. One of the most compelling parts of the home concert experience is when Jesse and the audiences begin to talk about the stories behind the songs, and inevitably conversations begin between he and the audience. It makes for great memories, stories, and sharing of stories, laughing, and crying. 
Because of this, Jesse is going to give away his new record to anyone attending his Australian home concerts who are willing to share their story with him.If a song that he performed, or has recorded has evoked a connection to something personal in your life that you are willing to share with Jesse and his audience, he will trade you his record for that story to add to a collection of similar stories from his travels across Australia.At the end of the tour, he will publish that collection to give to everyone that donated to this campaign.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>“<i>No matter how much time passes, no matter what takes place in the interim, there are some things we can never assign to oblivion, memories we can never rub away.</i>” - Haruki Murakami</p>
<br/><h3>Short Summary</h3> <p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Condemned to oblivion, a 90 year old factory comes back to life. A fascinating story of strength, determination and resilience. In this book that i present to you, i reveal what i found, by pure chance, in the course of my professional activity. I had the opportunity to witness and photograph the rebirth and development of a factory founded in 1920, whose facilities have been abandoned for years, and once relies on the contribution of almost a thousand employees, but unfortunately,  due to market circumstances,  had to face two processes of insolvency. Through this book you can make a journey in a place full of character and history, from oblivion… to revival…</p>

<h2>Welcome to BEND</h2>
<p>This has been such a fun album to work on.  Justin's vocal melodies, lyrical content and all round organic musicianship gives such a nice taste to the electronic timbre mixed with Sean's powerful drum grooves.   The BEND Album was meant to be a story of a journey between stars, passing down a street in a solar neighbourhood with sexual undertones.  We have only completed 1/3 of the story and need your help to tell the rest of it.  </p>

<h2>Budgeting Breakdown</h2>
<h3>Costs</h3>
<ul>
<li>OCL Studio's      2 days  @  800.00/day  + Tax  = 1680.00<ul><li>Record drums </li></ul>
</li>
<li>CPS Mastering<ul><li>6 tracks    480.00 + Tax =  504.00</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">TOTAL STUDIO COSTS = 2,184.00</p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-left:80px;"">We would also like to remaster Safe Harbour (there is noise on the track that is driving me crazy).  This was my own fault and we will not be adding to the campaign amount needed. Just wanted to let you know it will be that little bit better.</li>
<li>Merch Costs (All merchandise costs change depending on quantity ordered)<ul>
<li>Sunglasses 4.00 each + Tax =  4.20</li>
<li>T-Shirts 6.00 each + Tax =  6.30</li>
<li>Hoodie 30.00 each + Tax =  31.50</li>
<li>Vinyl 35.00 each + Tax = 36.75<ul><li>Total Cost = 78.75  + Shipping Costs which vary depending on package contents.<ul><li>This is factored into our perk packs but is counted as funding by indiegogo towards our goal.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This makes <strong><i>""The Everthing Bundle""</i> </strong> perk the <strong>best value</strong>  for contributors by far.   </p>
<ul><li>Indiegogo, Paypal and Credit Card Costs Avg 8-10 % = 500.00</li></ul>
<p>TOTAL Needed For Campaign Success   5,500.00 </p>
<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>The group of people all working together on this album have so much talent and the songs are so great it would be wasted letting Solar Interstellar Cetacea, Absolute Wonder, Have No Fear, Enter The Rhythm and Quaver just sit on my computer.  </p>
<p>If we reach our goal there are many things to set in motion.  Pre Production will have to be done for drums and vocals,  There are a couple of tunes that need some editing and bass replacement.  OCL Studio's will need to be booked for recording.  Post recording there will be editing, mixing and mastering for each track.  Once mastering has been completed its time to fulfill all our perk packs and look at an album release date which we would like to make no later then April/May 2017.  With a release set for stores, its time to get an electronic press kit out there.  And You....We can't say it any other way.  <strong>Without you there would be no BEND</strong>.  We would all like to thank you so very much and we would like to thank the people who are responsible for this site. So good. </p>

This has been such a fun album to work on.  Justin's vocal melodies, lyrical content and all round organic musicianship gives such a nice taste to the electronic timbre mixed with Sean's powerful drum grooves.   The BEND Album was meant to be a story of a journey between stars, passing down a street in a solar neighbourhood with sexual undertones.  We have only completed 1/3 of the story and need your help to tell the rest of it.  


Perk Pack Items








 ***NOTE T-SHIRT AND HOODIE PERKS.  PLEASE PLACE YOUR CHOICE WHITE OR BLACK AND SIZE BESIDE YOUR NAME WHEN YOU ENTER IT (ex Joe Blow WM).  IF YOU HAVE ALREADY PURCHASED YOUR PERK WE WILL CONTACT YOU BY EMAIL.

Budgeting Breakdown
Costs

OCL Studio's      2 days  @  800.00/day  + Tax  = 1680.00Record drums 

CPS Mastering6 tracks    480.00 + Tax =  504.00


TOTAL STUDIO COSTS = 2,184.00

We would also like to remaster Safe Harbour (there is noise on the track that is driving me crazy).  This was my own fault and we will not be adding to the campaign amount needed. Just wanted to let you know it will be that little bit better.
Merch Costs (All merchandise costs change depending on quantity ordered)
Sunglasses 4.00 each + Tax =  4.20
T-Shirts 6.00 each + Tax =  6.30
Hoodie 30.00 each + Tax =  31.50
Vinyl 35.00 each + Tax = 36.75Total Cost = 78.75  + Shipping Costs which vary depending on package contents.This is factored into our perk packs but is counted as funding by indiegogo towards our goal.





This makes ""The Everthing Bundle""  perk the best value  for contributors by far.   
Indiegogo, Paypal and Credit Card Costs Avg 8-10 % = 500.00
TOTAL Needed For Campaign Success   5,500.00 
The Goal
The group of people all working together on this album have so much talent and the songs are so great it would be wasted letting Solar Interstellar Cetacea, Absolute Wonder, Have No Fear, Enter The Rhythm and Quaver just sit on my computer.  
If we reach our goal there are many things to set in motion.  Pre Production will have to be done for drums and vocals,  There are a couple of tunes that need some editing and bass replacement.  OCL Studio's will need to be booked for recording.  Post recording there will be editing, mixing and mastering for each track.  Once mastering has been completed its time to fulfill all our perk packs and look at an album release date which we would like to make no later then April/May 2017.  With a release set for stores, its time to get an electronic press kit out there.  And You....We can't say it any other way.  Without you there would be no BEND.  We would all like to thank you so very much and we would like to thank the people who are responsible for this site. So good.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are Christian and Zorzes Katris and we are presenting you with our first recorded CD album production titled Bouzouki Nova, through the platform of funded participation. In the last few years we have been delving deeper into the composition of ethnic orchestral music through the blending of hybrid techniques of composition, based on the popular Greek Ethnic instrument ‘’Bouzouki’’ accompanied by a classical compact entity of strings, piano and accordion.<br/>The main musical influences of this album derive from <strong>Bach, Beethoven, Astor Piazolla , Hans Zimmer </strong>and last but not least from the very popular Greek composer <strong>George Zambetas, </strong>inspiring us through an extensive experience in theoretical knowledge and musical sounds to produce a hybrid and exceptional orchestral synthesis.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our goal is to raise €4,000 to cover the cost of a full-length album.</li>
<li>The ""Bouzouki Nova"" comes in a collective CD album edition consisting of five independent parts (movements) as well as two official video clips thereby creating a palette of high virtuosity and compact orchestration in both the solo part and the orchestral one.</li>
<li>As a flexible campaign, if we raise less than the desired goal we will still being pressed/duplicated of the CD Album as the budget allows.</li>
<li>Album artwork and design</li>
<li>Delivery and Postage Package</li>
<li>Director for video clips filiming<br/> </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are recommending and presenting an innovation in the development of musical composition and orchestration based on film and classical music through a long experience of concerts.</p>
<ul>
<li>We believe Music intersects with cultural boundaries, facilitating our “social self” by linking our shared experiences and intentions. Also music is a core human experience by facilitating human contact, human meaning, and human imagination of possibilities, tying it to our social instincts.</li>
<li>There are all of you who help and support the human spirit, and this is a great power to become better and to take another step in the future!<br/> </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The pivotal core of this music emerged when we were asked to participate in a very successful first concert for bouzouki and orchestra in the Athens Concert Hall many years ago.</p>
<ul><li>Ever since then, a long quest for new techniques in composition and musical form began with the Greek national instrument ‘’Bouzouki’’ in the lead role aiming to fuse the traditional sound with that of classical music.<br/> </li></ul>

 In questo momento nella tua carta di credito c'è un pezzo del nostro destino. Può essere un piccolo pezzo o un pezzo enorme, non importa, di solito i pezzi del destino sono tutti importanti. Noi abbiamo 2000€ e abbiamo bisogno di altri 2000€ per registrare il nostro secondo album ""Why, Nico?"".
4000 € è il budget complessivo che comprende la registrazione dei brani, mix e mastering del disco e la stampa dei cd. 
La vostra non è una donazione, è un pre-acquisto di ""Why, Nico?"".
Perché vogliamo fare dei cd nel 2015? Non potremmo fare semplicemente un album online? Hai tutte le ragioni di chiedere, il problema è che i locali pagano sempre meno e avere un cd da vendere ai concerti è qualcosa di fondamentale per consentirci di continuare a suonare.
In più vi abbiamo preparato una bellissima maglietta colorata della Tafel con sopra il dinosauro delle nostre prime locandine.

<h3>Nuestra historia</h3>
<p>Creada y dirigida por el maestro Daniel Diaz Ortega, violinista, arreglista y compositor de formación clásica, la REAL CHARANGA nace en marzo del 2003. Sus 13 años y 5 trabajos discográficos son muestra de la iniciativa vanguardista de su visión musical, pasando por los festivales y escenarios mas representativos de Colombia y ganando el reconocimiento nacional e internacional a su impecable trabajo musical.</p>
<p>Gracias a su versatilidad, a la calidad interpretativa de sus músicos, a los arreglos originales de temas de tradición afro-antillana lo que ha llevado a la REAL CHARANGA a estar en el top de las mejores propuestas musicales de Colombia y a ser un referente obligado de la salsa capitalina.</p>
<p>No todas las orquestas pueden darse el lujo de nadar entre dos aguas, aunque este es el caso de la REAL CHARANGA, quienes han demostrado a través de su trayectoria el dominio de géneros como la salsa, el jazz y la música clásica.</p>
<p>Ganadores del XXVIII Festival internacional de jazz del teatro libre 2016, invitados especiales al Rio Jazz Night Fest 2016 y ganadores del festival Jazz al Parque 2015, son algunos de sus mas recientes logros. Han compartido escenario con grandes músicos como Wayne Shorter, Esperanza Spalding, Courtney Pine, Henry Butler, Steven Bernstein, Groove Collective &amp; Jay Rodriguez y Pedrito Martinez entre otros. También ganadores al mejor tema inédito por ""Relato en 5"" en el festival jazz al Parque 2007, ganadores como mejor Orquesta del Festival Salsa al Parque en las versiones 2005, 2006 y 2007 e invitados de honor cerrando las versiones del 2009 y 2012 con una asistencia de mas de 70.000 personas.</p>
<p>“REAL GROOVE"" trabajo discográfico con el que conmemoraron sus 12 años de trayectoria, es una apuesta a un sonido internacional donde el acid jazz, el latin jazz y el Funk se mezclan entre Cumbias y Currulaos con el estilo característico que les ha sido merecedores a los mejores comentarios de la prensa especializada y del aval de sus seguidores. Actualmente la REAL Charanga se encuentra en pre-producción de su sexto trabajo “R-Evolution” a grabarse en los estudios de Audiovision, patrocinado por Tigo Music Colombia en el mes de Diciembre de 2016. </p>
<h3>Campaña R-EVOLUTION</h3>
<p>Es importante para nosotros hacer esta campaña pues el propósito es lograr tener los recursos económicos para hacer el prensaje de nuestro álbum, como también hacer el lanzamiento de este el cual se hará en el Teatro Libre de la ciudad de Bogotá. </p>
<p>Con este trabajo estamos apostando en lograr hacer una gira nacional y estar en grandes festivales donde podamos hacer conocer la música que estamos haciendo y lo que esta sucediendo musicalmente con la REAL, de igual manera sabiendo toda esa energía que metimos en este álbum queremos presentarnos a los Grammy latinos pues vemos que este sexto trabajo tuvo una gran calidad, como en la parte musical, grabación, mezcla,  masterización y producción.</p> <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Por que tu ayuda es importante?</span>
</div><div> <p>Este sexto trabajo fue grabado en los estudios de Audiovision y respaldado por TigoMusic Colombia, como también por el productor musical Juan Carlos “chato” Rivas, y como ingenieros Francisco Kiko Casto en la captura, Daniel Bustos en la mezcla y Camilo Silva en la masterizacion del álbum R-EVOLUTION. Con tu apoyo y tu aporte financiero, la REAL CHARANGA podrá realizar el prensaje (copias) de su trabajo discográfico, hacer la producción de su lanzamiento, la promoción de este sexto trabajo y una gira promocional. Para esto esperamos recaudar US 10.000 ¿te gustaría ser parte de este maravilloso sueño?</p>

Creada y dirigida por el maestro Daniel Diaz Ortega, violinista, arreglista y compositor de formación clásica, la REAL CHARANGA nace en marzo del 2003. Sus 13 años y 5 trabajos discográficos son muestra de la iniciativa vanguardista de su visión musical, pasando por los festivales y escenarios mas representativos de Colombia y ganando el reconocimiento nacional e internacional a su impecable trabajo musical.
Gracias a su versatilidad, a la calidad interpretativa de sus músicos, a los arreglos originales de temas de tradición afro-antillana lo que ha llevado a la REAL CHARANGA a estar en el top de las mejores propuestas musicales de Colombia y a ser un referente obligado de la salsa capitalina.
No todas las orquestas pueden darse el lujo de nadar entre dos aguas, aunque este es el caso de la REAL CHARANGA, quienes han demostrado a través de su trayectoria el dominio de géneros como la salsa, el jazz y la música clásica.
Ganadores del XXVIII Festival internacional de jazz del teatro libre 2016, invitados especiales al Rio Jazz Night Fest 2016 y ganadores del festival Jazz al Parque 2015, son algunos de sus mas recientes logros. Han compartido escenario con grandes músicos como Wayne Shorter, Esperanza Spalding, Courtney Pine, Henry Butler, Steven Bernstein, Groove Collective & Jay Rodriguez y Pedrito Martinez entre otros. También ganadores al mejor tema inédito por ""Relato en 5"" en el festival jazz al Parque 2007, ganadores como mejor Orquesta del Festival Salsa al Parque en las versiones 2005, 2006 y 2007 e invitados de honor cerrando las versiones del 2009 y 2012 con una asistencia de mas de 70.000 personas.
“REAL GROOVE"" trabajo discográfico con el que conmemoraron sus 12 años de trayectoria, es una apuesta a un sonido internacional donde el acid jazz, el latin jazz y el Funk se mezclan entre Cumbias y Currulaos con el estilo característico que les ha sido merecedores a los mejores comentarios de la prensa especializada y del aval de sus seguidores. Actualmente la REAL Charanga se encuentra en pre-producción de su sexto trabajo “R-Evolution” a grabarse en los estudios de Audiovision, patrocinado por Tigo Music Colombia en el mes de Diciembre de 2016. 
Campaña R-EVOLUTION
Es importante para nosotros hacer esta campaña pues el propósito es lograr tener los recursos económicos para hacer el prensaje de nuestro álbum, como también hacer el lanzamiento de este el cual se hará en el Teatro Libre de la ciudad de Bogotá. 
Con este trabajo estamos apostando en lograr hacer una gira nacional y estar en grandes festivales donde podamos hacer conocer la música que estamos haciendo y lo que esta sucediendo musicalmente con la REAL, de igual manera sabiendo toda esa energía que metimos en este álbum queremos presentarnos a los Grammy latinos pues vemos que este sexto trabajo tuvo una gran calidad, como en la parte musical, grabación, mezcla,  masterización y producción. Por que tu ayuda es importante?
 Este sexto trabajo fue grabado en los estudios de Audiovision y respaldado por TigoMusic Colombia, como también por el productor musical Juan Carlos “chato” Rivas, y como ingenieros Francisco Kiko Casto en la captura, Daniel Bustos en la mezcla y Camilo Silva en la masterizacion del álbum R-EVOLUTION. Con tu apoyo y tu aporte financiero, la REAL CHARANGA podrá realizar el prensaje (copias) de su trabajo discográfico, hacer la producción de su lanzamiento, la promoción de este sexto trabajo y una gira promocional. Para esto esperamos recaudar US 10.000 ¿te gustaría ser parte de este maravilloso sueño?

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are Heavy HK and UMMU, the duo behind I Kong's first homecoming tour to China in 2018. Some of you might be familiar with our regular programming of soundsystem events in Hong Kong and China. Over time, we have shared alot of joy, sang of many dreams and sailed to many corners. </p>
<p>From the first generation of Chinese migrants crossing the globe for Jamaica, Leslie Kong of Beverly's Records has planted a deep seed in Reggae music history. From Bob Marley’s first studio session to Toots &amp; Maytals, Jimmy Cliff.. and many more.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561004621/dkfg0uiaytosqjeyfsuz.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/>I Kong, a revered elder and highly respected Reggae artiste. Along with his son, Skunga Kong, a highly acclaimed producer distinguished as “Young Legend” by pioneers, they are heirs to Leslie Kong’s Jamaica-Chinese legacy. With Heavy HK and UMMU, they stepped foot into China to share this unique heritage and thus, fulfilling a cycle of mankind’s journey. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561004908/h5ipmqpzijadfkyxsgxz.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/>While in their Father's land, they spent a chemistry exploding week with <i>JahWahZoo</i>, Chengdu’s finest 7 piece Reggae band, as they prepared for their debut in Hong Kong's biggest festival - Clockenflap. The combination was a clear and dynamic hit!  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561018498/q7xw9go7csyvsemclsse.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p><br/><br/><strong><u><i>Catapulting us to this point, to create a historical Reggae album! </i></u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Legendary Jamaican Chinese Reggae icon... I Kong<br/>Highly acclaimed young prodigy producer... Skunga Kong<br/>Fans’ favourite Chinese Reggae band... JahWahZoo</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>A combination like none other, set in destiny!</i></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need?</h3>
<p>We are aiming to raise 150,000HKD to facilitate the album production<br/>This would include some of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recording Studio, Mastering, Printing, Pressing</li>
<li>Travel, Transport, Accommodation, Food</li>
<li>6 intensive weeks of creating and recording in Chengdu</li>
<li>Handling and Transaction fees</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Music is about bringing people together. In Reggae, the message of '<u><strong>Unity</strong></u>' is an overstanding. Coming from one blood, we are all Brothers and Sisters dispersed across this planet over time. As Bob Marley sings, “Movements of Jah People”. From one land to another.. I Kong and his story is a testament to this.<br/><br/>Reggae has recently been recognised as UNESCO as a global cultural treasure! With the recent induction of Jamaica's Reggae Gold Hall of Fame, Leslie Kong of Beverly Records was recognised for this formidable contributions in Jamaica’s music. From being the first to record Bob Marley, to producing Jimmy Cliff, Toots and The Maytals to being the co-founder of Island Records. He also played a big role in the soundtrack to “The Harder They Come”, starring Jimmy Cliff.<br/><br/>This incredible genre of music has touched every corner and in China, it is at a developing stage. We do not share the same commercial support, compared to pop music or other genres. It is magnificent to see the legacy of music and humanity go one round across the world and back. From Leslie Kong leaving China to Jamaica and having I Kong step foot for the first time in China to introduce all these heritage.<br/><br/>As the musical heir of Beverly Records’ Leslie Kong, I Kong is a bonafide icon, whose identity of being half Jamaican and half Chinese has delivered him as a messenger. In 2019, Heavy HK took on the mammoth task of a Homecoming Tour with I Kong and his son/protege, Skunga Kong. It was their first trip to his Father’s land and connected with China popular Reggae band, JahWahZoo. Through a week long of intensive rehearsals, they turned up the heat and was straight fyah.<br/><br/>Naturally, on his coming visit, I Kong, as a Teacher figure will spend time in China with JahWahZoo to make an album together. Passing on the knowledge through music, as prophesied in his lyrics ""Pass It On"", to the people of his father's homeland. This album will be produced by Skunga Kong, 3rd generation Chinese Jamaican musical pride continuing Beverly's Records' legacy.<br/><br/>Musical Journeys like this are historical and become a part of legendary tales passed on to generations. To Reggae lovers worldwide, Overseas Chinese or Chinese Reggae fans, this may call to your heartstrings.</p>

We are Heavy HK and UMMU, the duo behind I Kong's first homecoming tour to China in 2018. Some of you might be familiar with our regular programming of soundsystem events in Hong Kong and China. Over time, we have shared alot of joy, sang of many dreams and sailed to many corners. 
From the first generation of Chinese migrants crossing the globe for Jamaica, Leslie Kong of Beverly's Records has planted a deep seed in Reggae music history. From Bob Marley’s first studio session to Toots & Maytals, Jimmy Cliff.. and many more.
I Kong, a revered elder and highly respected Reggae artiste. Along with his son, Skunga Kong, a highly acclaimed producer distinguished as “Young Legend” by pioneers, they are heirs to Leslie Kong’s Jamaica-Chinese legacy. With Heavy HK and UMMU, they stepped foot into China to share this unique heritage and thus, fulfilling a cycle of mankind’s journey. 
While in their Father's land, they spent a chemistry exploding week with JahWahZoo, Chengdu’s finest 7 piece Reggae band, as they prepared for their debut in Hong Kong's biggest festival - Clockenflap. The combination was a clear and dynamic hit!  

 




Catapulting us to this point, to create a historical Reggae album! 
Legendary Jamaican Chinese Reggae icon... I KongHighly acclaimed young prodigy producer... Skunga KongFans’ favourite Chinese Reggae band... JahWahZoo
 
A combination like none other, set in destiny!
 

What We Need?
We are aiming to raise 150,000HKD to facilitate the album productionThis would include some of the following:

Recording Studio, Mastering, Printing, Pressing
Travel, Transport, Accommodation, Food
6 intensive weeks of creating and recording in Chengdu
Handling and Transaction fees

 

The Impact
Music is about bringing people together. In Reggae, the message of 'Unity' is an overstanding. Coming from one blood, we are all Brothers and Sisters dispersed across this planet over time. As Bob Marley sings, “Movements of Jah People”. From one land to another.. I Kong and his story is a testament to this.Reggae has recently been recognised as UNESCO as a global cultural treasure! With the recent induction of Jamaica's Reggae Gold Hall of Fame, Leslie Kong of Beverly Records was recognised for this formidable contributions in Jamaica’s music. From being the first to record Bob Marley, to producing Jimmy Cliff, Toots and The Maytals to being the co-founder of Island Records. He also played a big role in the soundtrack to “The Harder They Come”, starring Jimmy Cliff.This incredible genre of music has touched every corner and in China, it is at a developing stage. We do not share the same commercial support, compared to pop music or other genres. It is magnificent to see the legacy of music and humanity go one round across the world and back. From Leslie Kong leaving China to Jamaica and having I Kong step foot for the first time in China to introduce all these heritage.As the musical heir of Beverly Records’ Leslie Kong, I Kong is a bonafide icon, whose identity of being half Jamaican and half Chinese has delivered him as a messenger. In 2019, Heavy HK took on the mammoth task of a Homecoming Tour with I Kong and his son/protege, Skunga Kong. It was their first trip to his Father’s land and connected with China popular Reggae band, JahWahZoo. Through a week long of intensive rehearsals, they turned up the heat and was straight fyah.Naturally, on his coming visit, I Kong, as a Teacher figure will spend time in China with JahWahZoo to make an album together. Passing on the knowledge through music, as prophesied in his lyrics ""Pass It On"", to the people of his father's homeland. This album will be produced by Skunga Kong, 3rd generation Chinese Jamaican musical pride continuing Beverly's Records' legacy.Musical Journeys like this are historical and become a part of legendary tales passed on to generations. To Reggae lovers worldwide, Overseas Chinese or Chinese Reggae fans, this may call to your heartstrings.

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>Regional Rhythms is an interactive music submission project that allows members of the community to submit original music samples to an online portal, which are then collaged into full-length songs exploring the diverse music of the Midwest Region.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Your Contributions</h3>
<p>How funding can help this project grow:</p>
<ul>
<li>A big aspect of this project was traveling and immersing ourselves in the unique music scenes throughout the Midwest. Funding allows these trips to be possible and keep our crew exploring new places.  </li>
<li>Once this portion is completed, we hope to be able to enter this project in festivals all around the country. Your contributions will help cover entry and attendance fees. </li>
<li>We are proud of our low production costs, but in order to continue to get the word out, your contributions can help this idea travel the country. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Regional Rhythms is a music project aiming to engage not only our hometown local musicians, but musicians from local communities all around the Midwest (and more!). The Midwest is covered in ""small"" big cities who's music scenes tend to get overlooked in the shadow of larger known cities. Regional Rhythms crew know how special and lively these smaller music scenes are and we want the world to know as well.</p>
<p>Through the submission of a short, original sample of music inspired by any of our pre-recorded play-along music, musicians can contribute and add their own unique layers and watch songs come to life. Musicians then not only get to be apart of a collaborative project with musicians from many different states, they also have the ability to share the impact that their unique local music has on their life and creativity.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>As a project based on our community and contributors, we risk not raising enough recognition or acknowledgment. But as we continue to connect with music lovers all around the United States, we can continue to push to get the word out. Your contribution and backing do just that and we thank you! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Again, this project is designed to thrive around a large community following. Regional Rhythms has a presence on multiple social media platforms available for you to follow, share, and contribute. </p>

We are a rock n roll band from Cleveland, Ohio with a big goal. Along with our manager, Riley, we are planning a cross-country DIY tour to bring the steezy love across this great country we call home. We have shows booked from Detroit to South Dakota to Los Angeles and beyond. The only problem is that we need a van that can fit all of us (4 band members, 1 manager, 1 driver, and 1 roadie/sound girl) and all of our equipment. Vans are expensive and so is tour, which is why we are asking for your hard earned dollars. We are all working multiple jobs, selling all our stuff, and deeply considering selling our plasma to finance this experience. As hard as we work, we are still young students who are limited to low-wage jobs and school schedules which makes it challenging to make all the money we need to make this work. Our tour starts on June 15th, and we need to secure a van at least a month in advance just to be #safe. We are asking for $4750 because we found a perfect van that would fit all of us and our stuff for $4500 (!!!!) and Indiegogo takes 5% of what is donated to you as their fee, which explains the $250 wiggle area. I speak for all of us when we say that we cannot express how thankful we would be to all of you for helping us achieve this goal. We know it is a lot to ask for and we know that so many people struggle for money, so any donations would be appreciated times 10000000 million. We will play your garage, serenade you to sleep, bake you a cake, play your grandma's birthday party, anything to show that we are grateful for your contribution. It is all of our lifelong dream to be able to tour the country and share the music we create with other people. The world is so stressful and sad right now and what they really need is some good ol' fashioned rock n roll to remind them that we are all alive and here for a reason (TO ROCK). Anything helps, whether it's $0.75 or $700, and we will love all of your donations equally! Thank you so much for helping us out! And if you can't donate, please listen/ share our music with your friends or share this so we can achieve both our dreams of getting to tour in a smelly van with our best friends and also sharing the music we put our heart and soul into with the people that inspire us to write it.<br/></p></div>","Hello, we are Kevin, Nate, Greg, and Dave, otherwise known as Steeze Knees!

Vans are expensive and so is tour, which is why we are asking for your hard earned dollars. We are all working multiple jobs, selling all our stuff, and deeply considering selling our plasma to finance this experience. As hard as we work, we are still young students who are limited to low-wage jobs and school schedules which makes it challenging to make all the money we need to make this work. Our tour starts on June 15th, and we need to secure a van at least a month in advance just to be #safe. We are asking for $4750 because we found a perfect van that would fit all of us and our stuff for $4500 (!!!!) and Indiegogo takes 5% of what is donated to you as their fee, which explains the $250 wiggle area. I speak for all of us when we say that we cannot express how thankful we would be to all of you for helping us achieve this goal. We know it is a lot to ask for and we know that so many people struggle for money, so any donations would be appreciated times 10000000 million. We will play your garage, serenade you to sleep, bake you a cake, play your grandma's birthday party, anything to show that we are grateful for your contribution. It is all of our lifelong dream to be able to tour the country and share the music we create with other people. The world is so stressful and sad right now and what they really need is some good ol' fashioned rock n roll to remind them that we are all alive and here for a reason (TO ROCK). Anything helps, whether it's $0.75 or $700, and we will love all of your donations equally! Thank you so much for helping us out! And if you can't donate, please listen/ share our music with your friends or share this so we can achieve both our dreams of getting to tour in a smelly van with our best friends and also sharing the music we put our heart and soul into with the people that inspire us to write it.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a="""">       Hi, my name is Zach Webster, founder of  Rad Rocket.  We are a small business based out of Pawhuska, Oklahoma serving the surrounding area.  I am trying to grow the customer base and increase business, making one hand built custom Guitar/Bass cabinet at a time.  I have always valued originality more than anything.   I love music, art, carpentry and creating.  So, I put those things together to start Rad Rocket Cabs.  Ive built 12 prototypes under the guidance of my grandfather, August Hague. He has been a carpenter and craftsman for 60 years and has taught me the strongest building techniques. <br/>                 With our standard model, we start by giving you complete freedom of choice in all aspects with a few special design features added for good measure.  These unique choices give you a boutique quality product at an affordable price.  <br/>        We start with a selection of premium tone woods which include Baltic Birch, Maple, Cedar, Ash, and Pine.  We even let you choose the type of wood used in the bracing and baffle giving you the ultimate control over your cabs sonic character. <br/>         I can leave your custom cab naked with a clear coat, coat it with a particular stain or totally cover it in any color vinyl you can imagine. You have 100's of vinyl color options to choose from followed with 1000's of grill cover options, even your OWN images can be printed on the woven grill cloth.  We offer 12 colors of piping which include red, blue, green, brown, tan, cream, light grey, dark grey, gold, white, silver and classic black. Two choices of hardware (nickel plated or Black metal), two handle styles (leather or rubber)  and  three back options:  open, closed, and convertible back designs (patent pending).<br/>         One essential factor that is often overlooked is whether the back of 
the cabinet containing the speaker or speakers you use is open or 
closed.  There’s a big difference between the two since cabinet 
construction defines the shape of the sound wave that reaches the ears 
of those listening.  A myriad of other elements of cabinet construction are 
also relevant, including the type of wood used, the size and depth of 
the cabinet, and the thickness of the baffle, which is the piece of wood
 the speaker is mounted to. But whether the back of that cabinet is open or closed is the 
most dramatic and visibly obvious variation. Most open backed cabinets are actually just partly open, with upper and
 lower panels going halfway up. Open back 
cabs allow some of the speaker sound to emerge from the back and to a lesser extent, the sides. On stage, this abundance of 
sound can be quite helpful when monitors are inadequate or 
absent. This also allows some excellent sonic opportunities in the studio, too. 
Microphones can be placed at the back of the cabinet, where slightly 
dirtier and darker tones are typically available, and in an isolation 
booth the sound tends to mix and fill the space better. Without a closed 
back to naturally compress a speaker’s voice, open back cabinets might 
be considered more organic or accurate representatives of the sound that
 a guitar produces. High frequencies in particular benefit from this, 
but open-backed cabs tend to be gentle to the entire spectrum. Not so with closed back cabinets, which tend to accentuate the 
mid range and bass sounds. They are directional and punchier which create no back spill or side leakage.  Amplifiers with the same circuitry sound radically 
different when they are running open and closed-back cabinets. With the convertible back you get both options at the drop of a hat. Held on with an active 28 pounds of force using my patent pending design . All cabinets are also numbered, labeled, and signed on the inside.<br/>          We offer an awesome product at a fair price! Sure you can get generic overpriced cabs made from inferior materials but why when you can get a genuine piece of personalized art from Rad Rocket for about the same price?  We are primarily a custom shop but I can't let you guys have all the fun, so I created  11 ""special edition"" 
cab designs that are typically more expensive depending on the edition 
than our standard custom cab because they use very exotic tone woods, 
unique cover upgrades, added features, or a combination.<br/>      91 percent  of our donations go directly into labor and cost of materials for your custom cab, 9 percent  goes to indiegogo.  Check out my video and image gallery and please share this with any musicians you know.  Don't forget to use the indiegogo share tools.

They are gaining as much attention for their infectious attitude and kindness as they are for their heartfelt and energetic sound. After securing a slot on Kerrang radio after just 2 years of existence they are looking to continue their journey and bring a bright spark of hope to rock lovers worldwide. With two UK tours under their belts and a host of music video singles, FURIAN are seizing new listeners every day. Don't take our word for it. Ask Alex Baker (Kerrang) who was lost for words and simply said ""THIS-BAND-RULE"".</p><h3>What do FURIAN stand for? </h3><p>Let's get to the point with this.

Like every serious musician out there, we have sacrificed careers and the stability to go with it in the hope that we will gain enough support to make music full time. There is no backup plan. We don't have money and we don't have sponsorship. All we have is ourselves and our fans. Many would strike us off as a pip-dream but we refuse to give up. We don't want to play to corporate rules or make recycled garbage for the sake of earning money.

<h2>ALL YOU KNOW IS HELL</h2>
<p><br/>ALL YOU KNOW IS HELL is a solo project by Joseph Merlini: post-metal/post-rock percussionist and vocalist in Brooklyn, New York. Originally hailed from Orlando, Florida in search of an escape of a mundane and intimately proverse existence, Joseph took a different approach to his life in pursuit of emotional freedom and expression through music and other arts. Although Joseph has spent the better part of the last 16 years creating various musical projects and drumming for different hardcore bands (most recently WRIST DEEP of Brooklyn, NY), his efforts and passions are now primarily focused on his solo project and upcoming sophomore LP. For ALL YOU KNOW IS HELL, the concept and album touch upon personal struggles and experiences with sex, depression, anxiety, addiction, love and heartbreak. The album is an experimental outlet of provoked emotional trauma and intellect, providing an experimental landscape for exploring the deepest and most sincere struggles of private life.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Second Line Arts Collective is a 501(c)(3) Non-profit organization devoted to cultivating artistic excellence for students ages 15-23. Through a variety of programming, Second Line’s curriculum is designed to give aspiring creatives the tools necessary to succeed as artists and entrepreneurs. Traditionally, arts education programs focus solely on developing artist’s craft and technique. Today’s musicians are entrepreneurial artist, well versed in social media, marketing, branding, along with performance.

<p>Sanaa Music Workshop is our premiere program. Most, if not all arts programs, ignore the monetization process and focus solely on performance and technical musical ability. For example, standard arts programs teach students how to paint, play, and create beautiful art but fail to teach students how to make a living using their skill sets. We are here to enrich this community with a different type of arts program. At Sanaa Music Workshop we bring in working professionals as well as business leaders that teach our students how to monetize there art. Through our lecture series our students have had the opportunity to learn from and build relationships with industry leaders. Grammy Award winning/nominated artist like Jamison Ross, and Donny Markowitz are among those who have taught our students so far.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Steve McKenzie and I am passionate about the homeless in Chicago.  I work downtown and connect with them every day on my way to work.  In the course of these interactions, I’ve discovered some amazing people.  Willie Barbee is one of those people.  He is currently homeless, but he loves to sing for commuters on their way to work.  He is a wonderful soul.  My goal for this campaign is to make Willie some money so he doesn’t have to sleep in the shelter AND to make Willie feel loved by all of us!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I would like to raise at least $500 with this campaign.  The ""digital download"" of the song requires no cost to produce.  The CDs will cost between $2 and $2.50 to produce, with the benefit being that any extra CDs that aren't sold Willie can sell himself.  Plus, the CD will be a tangible reminder of Willie and others experiencing homelessness that people care about them and that there is hope.  The song has already been recorded and the disc artwork has been created, so once the campaign ends we'll be able to send our project to the CD replication company right away.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You will change Willie's life.  Even if all we do is meet the $500 goal, Willie will have money in his pocket and the realization that he is loved by all of us.  The last campaign I began helped a homeless author publish a book.  So I know we can do this...</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Given the simplicity of this project (a one song CD)/digital download, there really is only one risk and that is that the disc replication company takes longer than expected to produce the CD (which is highly unlikely)</span></p>

<h3>The Bus? On Vinyl? Yes, Please!</h3>
<p>Feels Good Community is a non-profit organization that presents the beloved Folly Fest music &amp; art festival in the beautiful Village of Gagetown, New Brunswick, each summer. 2019 will mark our 11th YEAR, and we want to make it the very best yet.</p>
<p>That's why we're embarking on a brand new idea with one of New Brunswick's all-time favourite, absolute legendary bands! We’re pleased as punch to announce that <strong><u>Grand Theft Bus</u></strong> will record a <strong>BRAND NEW ALBUM, LIVE FROM THE FOLLY STAGE!</strong> Err… Stages!</p>
<p>The band came to the Folly team to share their dream of recording a live album, and we couldn't think of a better home than Folly Fest! Grand Theft Bus has been a huge part of making Folly Fest a magical festival (this will be their 5th time at Folly), so what better way to celebrate that than to capture the magic permanently?</p>
<p>Playing (and recording) sets on both the Yippie AND the Feels Good mainstage, our most beloved genre-bending jammers will lay down a full-length album, performed live and in person for 2019 Folly goers! The band promises to play several brand new tracks, plus some of their golden oldies. The recording will then be pressed to <strong>LIMITED EDITION 12” VINYL</strong>, <strong>the first vinyl ever for The Bus</strong>!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Big Project, Big Budget</h3>
<p>If you've ever made a record yourself, you know that vinyl is EXPENSIVE. We estimate we'll need about <strong>$10,000</strong> to give this project the boost it needs to succeed! We're hoping to get there via donations &amp; pre-orders of the album, combined with support from the provincial music industry development program.</p>
<p>The major expenses for this project are:</p>
<p>- mixing &amp; vinyl mastering: ~$4,000<br/>- Vinyl pressing &amp; shipping: ~$3,000<br/>- Marketing, coordination, design, equipment rental (AKA 'the other stuff'): ~$5,000</p>
<p>When you pre-order or donate, you help us get this project off its feet. In exchange, your pre-order means that you will be among THE FIRST to receive the vinyl before it officially launches to the public.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Grand Theft Bus has had a humongous impact on the New Brunswick (and Canadian!) music scene. Playing for almost 20 years now, 'The Bus' were instrumental in spawning the music scene that we know and enjoy today. Their attention to detail! Their catchy hooks! The complex yet groovable rhythms! Their tones! Their general joie-de-vivre! Chances are good that if you've been to a local live music performance in the last 10 years, you've seen a band that was influenced by Grand Theft Bus. If you don't believe us, ask a local musician!</p>
<p>Not only that, but Grand Theft Bus members have played in dozens of other bands that have contributed to the diverse sonic palate of this province. Share? Force Fields? Some Dads? Olympic Symphonium? Senior Citizen? The Slate Pacific? And that barely scratches the surface! This truly is a supergroup, and one that we are honoured to partner with.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Bus has released 5 albums &amp; EPs, but <u>have never recorded a live album, and never released on vinyl</u>. We can't wait to help make that dream come true!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Not everyone has a record player, but everyone loves to love local! If you don't want to pre-order the album, please consider making a small donation or sharing the campaign with your friends. And of course, purchasing your weekend pass to Folly Fest helps us IMMENSELY in making this project a reality (<a href=""https://www.follyfest.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.follyfest.ca/</a>).</p>

<p><strong>The Story</strong></p>
<p>Hi everyone!  I'm singer/songwriter Steven Walsh and I've got a great NEW ALBUM!!  It's name is SOUL DISTORTION under my artist name DEJA EXO.</p>
<p>The music:  It's sounds amazing.  It's sophisticated and wild at the same time.  There's a sense of uniqueness to it, but it's full of history.  It's got drive and soul, beautiful melodies and harmonies, it floats and it stomps.</p>
<p>I can't wait to share it with you!</p>
<p>Over the last couple years I’ve been writing, developing and performing these gifts the universe gave me at open mics and gigs in Long Island, NYC and Baltimore (my hometown).   The responses to these songs, even the first time I'd play them out, was at times so remarkable ... I knew I needed to do an album.</p>
<p>So I tapped my good friend, (and excellent musician, producer, engineer), <a href=""https://mthakathi.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mthakathi</a> to help me. We went into his <a href=""http://www.ikhayastudios.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ikhaya Studios</a> in New Jersey, and got to work!  It's a bit experimental ... the base rhythms are acoustic guitar, in a nod to the singer/songwriter milieu that incubated these songs, but then we layered on background vocals, electric guitars and percussion.</p>
<p>The album is recorded, mixed, mastered ... and released digitally at <a href=""https://dejaexo.bandcamp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">dejaexo.bandcamp.com</a>. </p>
<p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>The album is available on most digital platforms now, but I need to tell the world how to find it.  That means publicity and touring.  When you tour doing original music, especially as a solo singer/songwriter, you don't get paid a lot ... you need to sell merchandise, and physical CDs are the most important part of that.   This campaign has flexible funding ...  initial contributions will go to CD production, shipping/packaging costs, and merch.  The funds closer to the campaign target will go toward publicity/promotion expenses, including some video production.  If we go over the target ... there are a couple awesome songs not on the album that I would record as bonus tracks.</p>
<p>Besides my deep thanks and appreciation ... I did try to make the perks interesting and fun.  And once I get this next phase under way ... it allows me to keep creating great music that hopefully will touch more people's lives.  I'm also a photographer and visual artist ... I see any number of ways that this intersection of art and music can lead to exciting and original works.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>Besides contributing directly to this campaign, there are any number of ways you can help!  Give the new songs a listen!  Share with your friends ... you know what they like, once you check out my songs, share them with the friends that you think will like 'em!  And please say hi!</p>
<p>Love to you all!</p>

Hi everyone!  I'm singer/songwriter Steven Walsh and I've got a great NEW ALBUM!!  It's name is SOUL DISTORTION under my artist name DEJA EXO.
The music:  It's sounds amazing.  It's sophisticated and wild at the same time.  There's a sense of uniqueness to it, but it's full of history.  It's got drive and soul, beautiful melodies and harmonies, it floats and it stomps.
I can't wait to share it with you!
Over the last couple years I’ve been writing, developing and performing these gifts the universe gave me at open mics and gigs in Long Island, NYC and Baltimore (my hometown).   The responses to these songs, even the first time I'd play them out, was at times so remarkable ... I knew I needed to do an album.
So I tapped my good friend, (and excellent musician, producer, engineer), Mthakathi to help me. We went into his Ikhaya Studios in New Jersey, and got to work!  It's a bit experimental ... the base rhythms are acoustic guitar, in a nod to the singer/songwriter milieu that incubated these songs, but then we layered on background vocals, electric guitars and percussion.
The album is recorded, mixed, mastered ... and released digitally at dejaexo.bandcamp.com. 
What I Need & What You Get

The album is available on most digital platforms now, but I need to tell the world how to find it.  That means publicity and touring.  When you tour doing original music, especially as a solo singer/songwriter, you don't get paid a lot ... you need to sell merchandise, and physical CDs are the most important part of that.   This campaign has flexible funding ...  initial contributions will go to CD production, shipping/packaging costs, and merch.  The funds closer to the campaign target will go toward publicity/promotion expenses, including some video production.  If we go over the target ... there are a couple awesome songs not on the album that I would record as bonus tracks.
Besides my deep thanks and appreciation ... I did try to make the perks interesting and fun.  And once I get this next phase under way ... it allows me to keep creating great music that hopefully will touch more people's lives.  I'm also a photographer and visual artist ... I see any number of ways that this intersection of art and music can lead to exciting and original works.
Other Ways You Can Help

Besides contributing directly to this campaign, there are any number of ways you can help!  Give the new songs a listen!  Share with your friends ... you know what they like, once you check out my songs, share them with the friends that you think will like 'em!  And please say hi!
Love to you all!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As many of you know, I've been performing music since I was very young, with an incredibly diverse world of musicians. All the while, I have written original material. Most of my life has been spent working dead end jobs to get by, and as the years went by, there was less and less time to dream. I'm finally at the point where I'm ready to give myself a chance, and put everything I have into a solo music career. I need your help and support to live the dream!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This album has been a labor of love, and has allowed me to reconnect with musicians from my past, and meet and perform with new friends across the country. Over the past three months, I've traveled and rallied 12 incredibly talented musicians to track and record an album of all albums. The record consists of 4 separate album sides, with 4 songs on each side. Each side of the album represents a time period/genre that has inspired my being. An undertaking of this breadth deserves to be pressed to vinyl.</p>
<p>In order to cover the cost of pressing the double LPs, we need to sell 350 copies of the album in advance at a discount price of 18$ per album (plus 2$ shipping US)</p>
<p>Once the pressing is complete, you will receive your copy of the double LP and a gift bag of various merch items</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This honestly the scariest thing I've ever done, but it feels like destiny. With your help and support, I can finally fulfill a goal that has taken half a lifetime to achieve.</p>

My name is Corey, and I am the owner of C. Whitney Guitars, best know as the company that brought you the Dragon's Heart Guitar Pick.  The Dragon's Heart has been wildly successfu,l and now we are pushing to launch my next design: the Dragon's Scale Guitar Pick.  For those players out there that have been following us closely, you know that I have been working on this for a while, and you have seen the basic concept of the Dragon's Scale design in our recently released Wyvern Series Guitar Picks.  The production details and logistics of this new line have been planned out and we are ready to move forward.  This campaign aims to raise the remaining funds we require to start up production and get these picks shipping out in time for the holidays.  Your support of this campaign will ensure we bring the Dragon's Scale Guitar Pick to life a full year earlier than our current budget will allow.

<h3>Shadow Windhawk ""Exhumed""</h3>
<p>I am Shadow Windhawk, a horror rock musician residing in Queens, NYC. Over the last three years, I've independently released an acoustic EP, two albums, two stand alone singles, two pro shot music videos and also appeared on HorrorHound Records' ""It's Only A Movie"" 12"" vinyl compilation. In May this year, I released ""Cremation Garden"", the second album in my ""Funerary Trilogy"" and the followup to 2014's ""Casket Spray"". Both albums have been very well received in the press and in the horror community.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479780758/zcinqcbplzkmniq2hbne.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>After months of setbacks, I am happy to confirm that the long-awaited 12"" vinyl release of ""Cremation Garden"" is finally approaching and once it arrives at last, only two SW songs will have yet to appear on vinyl records, which leads me to this brand new LE 7"" vinyl release, ""Exhumed"".</p>
<p>""Exhumed"" is a random color 7"" vinyl release featuring the Shadow Windhawk singles, ""Unpleasant Dreams"" and ""The Never Dead"". This run is called the ""Trick or Treat Bag"" pressing, because every copy of the new record will be unique. These will be limited to 200 pcs worldwide.</p>
<p>So why run an IndieGoGo for this project? Three reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>To create the first ever Shadow Windhawk 7"" vinyl, supplementing the new ""Cremation Garden"" 12"" while also giving die hard fans a chance to complete their collections.</li>
<li>To re-press my first album, ""Casket Spray"" to CD (with artwork by 90's Goosebumps illustrator, Tim Jacobus) for those of you who missed the 4 previous pressings.</li>
<li>To help fund the completion of production for the final SW album in the ""Funerary Trilogy"", entitled - ""The Funeral Cortège"".</li>
</ul>
<p>With the proceeds from these additional pressings and the back stock sales of the new ""Cremation Garden"" LP, my goal is to finish the recording of ""The Funeral Cortège"" and begin assembling a budget to finally take Shadow Windhawk and the Morticians on tour in the United States in 2017 / 2018.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What I'm Asking &amp; What You'll Get</h3>
<p>The $6,000 USD goal from this campaign will go directly toward three key things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pressing ""Unpleasant Dreams"" and ""The Never Dead"" to 7"" 'Trick or Treat Bag' Vinyl.</li>
<li>Pressing ""Casket Spray"" to high-quality CD.</li>
<li>Helping to fund the third Shadow Windhawk record, ""The Funeral Cortege"".</li>
</ul>
<p>All the perks being offered on this campaign are being priced as modestly as possible; I don't want anyone to think of this effort as giving something for nothing. If anything, this is the easiest way for you guys to secure copies of the SW albums that you want to own or need to complete your collections. The only way for these to exist is if I press them myself - and thus far, this platform of crowd sourcing has proven to be a very effective means, not only for you guys to help me continue making music on a regular basis, but for me to give you all a lot more of what you want in terms of both content and merchandise from SW and Black Flame Records.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By assisting me in this campaign, you are helping to ensure that more Shadow Windhawk music and videos will be produced in the coming year. Having run two successful campaigns prior to this one, I've learned in a very profound way that these projects often make the relationship between supporter and artist stronger. I know that together, we are unstoppable. There's no limit to what independent musicians can create when they're surrounded by people who believe in what they're working toward. I've been fortunate to have that kind of support from SW fans like you and I thank you all for that.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot contribute by picking up a record or two, you can still help!</p>
<ul>
<li>Spread the word about Shadow Windhawk and this campaign on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.</li>
<li>Share this campaign directly, using the share tools located on this page!</li>
<li>Even if you mention it once to someone you know, you are playing a vital role in the success of this campaign!</li>
</ul>
<p>To everyone who has ever believed in Shadow Windhawk and the Morticians, I want to extend my deepest gratitude. Each and every time you have rallied around my work, it has grown to become so much more. I will continue to work towards raising the bar and creating new music with each passing year. And I will do all I can to get my band on the road one day soon.</p>

They think we’re mad.
But.....we are Rebel, we are Riot !                            


So, who we are ?


The Rebel Riot is no band in the conventional sense. we are the musical part of the ""Rebel community"" in Yangon.

Therefore the membership of our band is also not static, who want to join may get involved, however the main cast of the band consists of Kyaw Kyaw (voc/guit.) , Oakar (voc/bass) and Zarni (drums). When we give concerts sometimes Min Zar Win helps us singing and Phoe Pyae helps playing guitar.Part of this community is also a T-shirt-printing workshop, a punk stuff- online-shop and a tattoo studio and a (still) small punk living community.
The aim of this community is to enable as many punks as possible an independent life, to live, work and make music together in an anarchist collective.
We formed our band as a reaction to the bloody crackdown of the ""safran revolution"" in 2007. During this time in Myanmar many people were protesting against the oppression and corruption of the military system. The Rebel Riot at this time was made of six members, playing small underground gigs. We wanted to use our music as a way to speak about freedom and the errors of the current political system. 
Now in 2016 there have been many changes in Rebel Riot. Over the course of nine years many members changed, but their values have stayed the same. The Rebel Riot has released two E.Ps, Puppet Society (2013) and Fuck Religious Rules (2014). We had the opportunity to tour Indonesia twice in 2013 and 2014, playing at festivals such as the Libertad Fest.

We'd like to have the opportunity to share our music with a larger audience, to give concerts with some european bands, exchange experiences and return back to myanmar with many new friends and ideas. 

What we need

for this adventure we need solidarity of all punx and friends in the whole world.... we try to raise money ourselves, but it is just too much and we are just poor punx.  only for the visa we need nearly 100 euros per person. and the flight to Germany will cost about 900 euros per person. so fucking much money !

</ul><p><strong>1. <u>PRESENTACIÓN: CARLOS DE AVILA Y LA CANCIÓN PROPUESTA</u></strong></p><p>El presente proyecto permite participar en el financiamiento de una producción musical y audiovisual que le dará un renovado impulso a la canción de autor en un mundo cada vez más necesitado de amor, justicia y unidad, donde se requiere encontrar el camino para la construcción de las soluciones definitivas a los problemas y retos que enfrenta la humanidad.</p><p><strong>Carlos de Ávila</strong> es el seudónimo artístico de Carlos Eduardo López Dávila, cantautor nacido en Colombia, en San Juan de Pasto (Nariño), quien ha desarrollado su carrera artística en algunos países de América del Sur, con tres producciones musicales bajo el género de la canción de autor, teniendo como sus principales influencias a cantautores como Joan Manuel Serrat, Alberto Cortez, Silvio Rodríguez, Pablo Milanés, Víctor Manuel y Chico Buarque, entre otros, y a géneros como la canción tipo trova, el son cubano, la bosanova y la canción andina. La iniciativa artística desarrollada por Carlos de Ávila se denomina ""<u>Canción Propuesta</u>"" y busca recrear la visión del proceso constructivo de una nueva orden de cosas en el mundo, o sea, de un nuevo proceso civilizatorio de alcance global, sobre la base del paradigma de  ""<u>la unidad en la diversidad</u>"", que parte de considerar que todos los individuos que habitan este planeta tienen el derecho a una vida digna y el potencial de construir un orden en continuo progreso en armonía con los demás y con el medio ambiente, un orden que garantice la justicia y el bienestar para todos sin distinción de etnia o raza, de religión o credo, de nacionalidad, de clase o grupo social, de profesión u oficio.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553429836/auigiivz2c5bxtulqg7g.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>La <u>unidad en la diversidad</u> conlleva, gracias a la conjunción de otros principios y de los medios y recursos que la complementan, a la construcción de un sustrato común y a la emergencia de una inteligencia colectiva en todos los ámbitos, locales, regionales, nacionales y globales y en todos los procesos sociales, económicos y culturales, de modo que se puedan tomar las mejores decisiones y encontrar, bajo la guía de la búsqueda de la verdad y la unidad, las soluciones más acertadas en beneficio general, sin la interferencia de los factores de poder, ni la defensa de intereses particulares o de doctrinas políticas, económicas o religiosas que compiten por la supremacía y dividen a la humanidad.</p><p>Las canciones de Carlos de Avila muestran la consolidación de un estilo propio, tanto en su fraseo musical y en la personalización de los diversos estilos musicales que conforman su repertorio, como en el manejo del texto versificado, profundo y reflexivo, con el respaldo de una voz expresiva y fuerte. Las canciones hablan de los problemas, dramas y aspiraciones del mundo de hoy, tales como la migración forzosa o cuasi forzosa de millones de personas en la búsqueda de lugares donde desarrollar un proyecto de vida para si mismos y sus familias, la crisis ambiental global que se cierne como una amenaza para la supervivencia de la humanidad entera, la discriminación o persecución de millones de personas por su sexo, su raza, su origen o sus creencias, la exacerbación de los extremos de riqueza y de pobreza en el mundo, el maltrato a los niños y la falta de oportunidades que padecen, el sufrimiento injustificado de millones y millones de seres humanos en todo el planeta, pero también hablan de la búsqueda y la construcción de la paz, del amor de pareja como medio para el desarrollo de potencialidades personales y espirituales, de la búsqueda de la verdad espiritual y del rol creciente y cada vez más indispensable de la mujer en la transformación del mundo.</p><p>De esta manera, todos los problemas y dolores se comprenden como los estertores de un mundo que se derrumba, que se desintegra, cuyos cimientos están irremediablemente dañados, pues las instituciones, estructuras y valores del orden vigente, que se fundamenta en la competencia, la dominación, la división y el conflicto, no pueden proveer ninguna solución real a la crisis existente, por lo que la única salida radica en la construcción de un nuevo orden global fundado en la cooperación, la reciprocidad y el servicio, acorde con las necesidades y potencialidades de toda la humanidad como desarrollo del paradigma de la unidad en la diversidad y de sus principios complementarios, entre ellos: la igualdad de mujeres y hombres, la armonía del conocimiento científico y espiritual, la superación de todo tipo de prejuicios, la eliminación de los extremos de riqueza y de pobreza, la armonía del ser humano con el entorno que lo rodea, la búsqueda libre e independiente de la verdad, la proscripción de la violencia en todas sus formas y la toma de decisiones en forma cooperativa, entre otros principios y herramientas. De esta forma, las canciones recrean la visión de un mundo posible en beneficio de todos y cada uno de los habitantes del planeta, no como un mero ideal sino con los medios y fundamentos necesarios para construirlo, sobre la base del trabajo infatigable de muchas personas que con mayor o menor consciencia conforman hoy una ""<u>minoría creativa</u>"", que comparten una visión y una misión común para construir un nuevo proceso civilizatorio y que al mismo tiempo, a la manera de Gandhi, buscan personificar en sí mismos el cambio que ellos pregonan.</p><p><strong>2. <u>PRODUCCIÓN MUSICAL Y AUDIOVISUAL: ""EN EL MISMO TREN""</u></strong></p><p>El álbum a ser producido lleva el título de una de sus canciones, de la cual existe un vídeo promocional publicado en YouTube en la siguiente dirección: </p><div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZecYhGczRlU?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p>La canción se refiere al drama de los emigrantes, los refugiados y desplazados en el mundo de hoy, como también a la lógica destructiva del mercado y la economía, que arrasa con la cultura y el medio ambiente, creando diferencias abismales de oportunidades entre las personas y entre los diversos países del mundo, lo que lleva a olvidar, que todos somos viajeros de un mismo tren, con un mismo destino, así ocupemos vagones distintos con condiciones y suerte diferentes. La canción también hace referencia al proceso de construcción de un nuevo orden de cosas en el mundo, con el trabajo infatigable de muchas personas a lo largo y ancho del planeta.</p><p>Las canciones, así, desarrollan en particular el paradigma de la unidad en diversidad y sus principios complementarios en medio de los conflictos y retos de la humanidad: el rol de la mujer y la necesaria igualdad de mujeres y hombres, la unidad orgánica de la humanidad, la unicidad del mundo espiritual y la realidad espiritual del ser humano, la necesaria armonía con el medio ambiente, la situación y la potencialidad de la infancia, el contraste entre el mundo viejo que se derrumba y el mundo nuevo que se construye, con una referencia concreta al proceso de paz en Colombia y un par de canciones de amor, una que recrea el amor idealizado y la otra dedicada a la actual esposa y compañera del cantautor.</p><p>El siguiente gráfico muestra el título de cada canción, la temática y el ritmo utilizado:</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553552828/uy97kkfqvz4fscayf4pd.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>3. <u>EL PROYECTO DE PRODUCCIÓN Y DIFUSIÓN DE LA CANCIÓN PROPUESTA</u></strong></p><p>El <u>Proyecto de Producción y Difusión de la Canción Propuesta</u> en su primera etapa busca el financiamiento, montaje y desarrollo de la producción musical y audiovisual bajo el título de: ""<u>En el mismo tren</u>"", que incluye 12 canciones en texto y música de Carlos de Avila con los siguientes componentes:</p><ol>

La iniciativa artística desarrollada por Carlos de Ávila se denomina ""Canción Propuesta"" y busca recrear la visión del proceso constructivo de una nueva orden de cosas en el mundo, o sea, de un nuevo proceso civilizatorio de alcance global, sobre la base del paradigma de  ""la unidad en la diversidad"", que parte de considerar que todos los individuos que habitan este planeta tienen el derecho a una vida digna y el potencial de construir un orden en continuo progreso en armonía con los demás y con el medio ambiente, un orden que garantice la justicia y el bienestar para todos sin distinción de etnia o raza, de religión o credo, de nacionalidad, de clase o grupo social, de profesión u oficio.La unidad en la diversidad conlleva, gracias a la conjunción de otros principios y de los medios y recursos que la complementan, a la construcción de un sustrato común y a la emergencia de una inteligencia colectiva en todos los ámbitos, locales, regionales, nacionales y globales y en todos los procesos sociales, económicos y culturales, de modo que se puedan tomar las mejores decisiones y encontrar, bajo la guía de la búsqueda de la verdad y la unidad, las soluciones más acertadas en beneficio general, sin la interferencia de los factores de poder, ni la defensa de intereses particulares o de doctrinas políticas, económicas o religiosas que compiten por la supremacía y dividen a la humanidad.Las canciones de Carlos de Avila muestran la consolidación de un estilo propio, tanto en su fraseo musical y en la personalización de los diversos estilos musicales que conforman su repertorio, como en el manejo del texto versificado, profundo y reflexivo, con el respaldo de una voz expresiva y fuerte. Las canciones hablan de los problemas, dramas y aspiraciones del mundo de hoy, tales como la migración forzosa o cuasi forzosa de millones de personas en la búsqueda de lugares donde desarrollar un proyecto de vida para si mismos y sus familias, la crisis ambiental global que se cierne como una amenaza para la supervivencia de la humanidad entera, la discriminación o persecución de millones de personas por su sexo, su raza, su origen o sus creencias, la exacerbación de los extremos de riqueza y de pobreza en el mundo, el maltrato a los niños y la falta de oportunidades que padecen, el sufrimiento injustificado de millones y millones de seres humanos en todo el planeta, pero también hablan de la búsqueda y la construcción de la paz, del amor de pareja como medio para el desarrollo de potencialidades personales y espirituales, de la búsqueda de la verdad espiritual y del rol creciente y cada vez más indispensable de la mujer en la transformación del mundo.De esta manera, todos los problemas y dolores se comprenden como los estertores de un mundo que se derrumba, que se desintegra, cuyos cimientos están irremediablemente dañados, pues las instituciones, estructuras y valores del orden vigente, que se fundamenta en la competencia, la dominación, la división y el conflicto, no pueden proveer ninguna solución real a la crisis existente, por lo que la única salida radica en la construcción de un nuevo orden global fundado en la cooperación, la reciprocidad y el servicio, acorde con las necesidades y potencialidades de toda la humanidad como desarrollo del paradigma de la unidad en la diversidad y de sus principios complementarios, entre ellos: la igualdad de mujeres y hombres, la armonía del conocimiento científico y espiritual, la superación de todo tipo de prejuicios, la eliminación de los extremos de riqueza y de pobreza, la armonía del ser humano con el entorno que lo rodea, la búsqueda libre e independiente de la verdad, la proscripción de la violencia en todas sus formas y la toma de decisiones en forma cooperativa, entre otros principios y herramientas. De esta forma, las canciones recrean la visión de un mundo posible en beneficio de todos y cada uno de los habitantes del planeta, no como un mero ideal sino con los medios y fundamentos necesarios para construirlo, sobre la base del trabajo infatigable de muchas personas que con mayor o menor consciencia conforman hoy una ""minoría creativa"", que comparten una visión y una misión común para construir un nuevo proceso civilizatorio y que al mismo tiempo, a la manera de Gandhi, buscan personificar en sí mismos el cambio que ellos pregonan.2. PRODUCCIÓN MUSICAL Y AUDIOVISUAL: ""EN EL MISMO TREN""El álbum a ser producido lleva el título de una de sus canciones, de la cual existe un vídeo promocional publicado en YouTube en la siguiente dirección: La canción se refiere al drama de los emigrantes, los refugiados y desplazados en el mundo de hoy, como también a la lógica destructiva del mercado y la economía, que arrasa con la cultura y el medio ambiente, creando diferencias abismales de oportunidades entre las personas y entre los diversos países del mundo, lo que lleva a olvidar, que todos somos viajeros de un mismo tren, con un mismo destino, así ocupemos vagones distintos con condiciones y suerte diferentes. La canción también hace referencia al proceso de construcción de un nuevo orden de cosas en el mundo, con el trabajo infatigable de muchas personas a lo largo y ancho del planeta.Las canciones, así, desarrollan en particular el paradigma de la unidad en diversidad y sus principios complementarios en medio de los conflictos y retos de la humanidad: el rol de la mujer y la necesaria igualdad de mujeres y hombres, la unidad orgánica de la humanidad, la unicidad del mundo espiritual y la realidad espiritual del ser humano, la necesaria armonía con el medio ambiente, la situación y la potencialidad de la infancia, el contraste entre el mundo viejo que se derrumba y el mundo nuevo que se construye, con una referencia concreta al proceso de paz en Colombia y un par de canciones de amor, una que recrea el amor idealizado y la otra dedicada a la actual esposa y compañera del cantautor.El siguiente gráfico muestra el título de cada canción, la temática y el ritmo utilizado:3. EL PROYECTO DE PRODUCCIÓN Y DIFUSIÓN DE LA CANCIÓN PROPUESTAEl Proyecto de Producción y Difusión de la Canción Propuesta en su primera etapa busca el financiamiento, montaje y desarrollo de la producción musical y audiovisual bajo el título de: ""En el mismo tren"", que incluye 12 canciones en texto y música de Carlos de Avila con los siguientes componentes:

El aporte al proyecto puede hacerse mediante cualquiera de los 6 paquetes de apoyo y recompensas que se han diseñado, con valores que van desde USD $11 hasta USD $140, pero el apoyo puede darse de la forma como cada uno sienta que le es posible realizarlo, desde su propia trinchera y desde su propia experiencia.En cualquier caso, muchas gracias.

<p><b>Tomás del Real &amp; Eiliv Ribe’s first duo album</b></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>¿Who are we?</b></p>
<p>We come from countries situated in the extremes to the north and south of the world. Despite the distance between Chile and Norway, our countries have their landscapes of wast west coasts and many mountains in common. At the same time the history and cultural influences are quite different. These similiarities and in similarities we bring into our music. Tomás is already despite his young age an experienced singer songwriter and Eiliv has been playing his fiddle in many different constellations in different genres. Now we’ll join forces and write more original music together and arrange existing songs of ours for the format. We blend our forms of expression into a new unity – connecting south and north with influences from wherever we go and believe we bring something fresh to the musical scene, that hopefully is and will be to your liking and interest. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>¿What do we want?</b></p>
<p>After months of travelling and touring together - sharing a wide palette of experiences, we want to put these into beautiful melodies, songs and tunes. Quite some were already written and arranged on tour, but more is currently in the making and there is also more to come as we’ll get together again after some time separated by the Atlantic. ""Flying Hats"" will be our first duo album that will catch all these nice moments, created by our vision of folk music and it’s meeting with other current influences – but not the last one!</p>
<p><b>What do we need? What do you get!</b></p>
<p>It’s a financial challenge to record an album in a studio, especially as self-managed musicians. All the hours on the studio, plus mixing and mastering, it's not a cheap thing to do, but with your help this can happen! The plan is to record 10-12 songs/tunes in the beggining of February (we’re currently looking at options in Slovenia and Norway), then we will mix it and release it as soon as it's finished! </p>
<p>After that? Spread it around the world!</p>
<p><b>Why is it so important to do it? </b></p>
<p>It’s difficult to get fundings or support from bigger institutions to create and spread new music (especially good non-commercial stuff!). Collaborating directly with the audience around the world is a unique opportunity with less risks. And It is a kick to know that the people on the ground, being friends, fans or other people interested in what this could be - are supporting us!</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>Still, if the project doesn't reach the goal, all the money will of course go back to the owners. But with your support we can do it! And well, if we get more money than we’ve set as our goal, it will be very usefull anyway, because there are travel costs to cover and we need to eat as well!</p>
<p><b>Other ways of helping!</b></p>
<p>If for any reason you are not able to contribute in an financial way, there is also something very important that you can do: Share this idea!</p>
<p>We need as much people as possible to put this project together, so if you can tell your friends, family, schoolmates, pets or put the videos or the campaign link onto a webpage/magazine/whatever, it would be very very helpfull! And we would be very thankful. </p>

<h3>Primer álbum del dúo Tomás del Real &amp; Eiliv Ribe</h3>

<b><h3>¿Quienes somos?</h3></b>
</div>
<p>Venimos de dos países situados en los extremos norte y sur del mundo. . A pesar de la distancia entre Chile y Noruega, ambos países tienen costa oeste y muchas montañas en común. Al mismo tiempo, la historia y culturales influencias son muy diferentes. Estas similitudes y diferencias se puede oír en la nuestra música. Tomás ya pesar de su corta edad es un cantautor con experiencia y Eiliv ha estado tocando el violín en muchas constelaciones diferentes en diferentes géneros. Ahora vamos a unir sus fuerzas, escribir más música original juntos y re-arreglar canciones  ya compuestas por nosotros. Los dos juntos mezclamos nuestras formas de expresión en una nueva unidad - que conecta al sur y al norte con influencias de todos los lugares a los que hemos ido y creemos que eso trae elementos frescos a la escena musical emergente, que esperamos será de tu agrado e interés!</p>
<p></p>
<h3>¿Qué es lo que queremos?</h3>
<p>Luego de un montón de tiempo de viajar y tocar música juntos, compartiendo una gran gama de experiencias por el mundo, queremos poner esto en hermosas melodías, canciones y piezas musicales. Muchas de estas, escritas y arregladas en gira, además de algunas otras nuevas composiciones en las que estamos trabajando en el momento y que han llegado luego de un gran tiempo separados por el atlántico. ""Flying Hats"" será el primer álbum que captura todos esos momentos agradables, creada por nuestra mirada del Folk Music y encontrada con nuestras otras influencias -  pero no el último!</p>
<p></p>
<h3>¿Qué necesitamos? Que obtienes!</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Todos saben lo difícil y costoso es para grabar un álbum en el estudio, especialmente si son músicos autogestionados. Todas las horas en el estudio, además de la mezcla y masterización, no es una cosa barata de hacer, pero con tu ayuda vamos a hacer que suceda! El plan consiste en grabar 10-12 canciones/piezas a principios de febrero (Estamos viendo lugares en Eslovenia y Noruega),  para después mezclarlo y publicarlo tan pronto como esté terminado!</p>
<p>¿Después de eso? difundirlo por todo el mundo!</p>
<p></p>
<h3>¿Por qué es tan importante hacerlo? </h3>
<div>
<p>Es difícil conseguir financiaciones o apoyo de las instituciones más grandes para crear y difundir la nueva música (sobre música de calidad y  no-comercial!). Colaborando directactamente con el público de todo el mundo es una oportunidad única con menos riesgos. Y Es un golpe fuerte saber que la gente en la tierra, siendo amigos, fans y otras personas interesadas en lo que esto podría ser - nos están apoyando!</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>Aún así, si el proyecto no llega a la meta, todo el dinero, por supuesto, volverá a los propietarios. Pero con su ayuda podemos hacerlo! Y bueno, si tenemos más dinero que nos hemos fijado como meta, será muy útil de todos modos, porque hay gastos de viaje para cubrir y tenemos que comer también!</p>

<p></p>
<h3>Otras maneras de Ayudar!</h3>
<div>
<p>Si por alguna razón no están en condiciones de contribuir de una manera económica, también hay algo muy importante que pueden hacer: Compartir esta idea !!</p>
<p>Necesitamos la mayor cantidad de personas posible para poner este proyecto en conjunto, así que si pueden decirle a sus amigos, familiares, compañeros de escuela, mascotas o poner los vídeos o el enlace de la campaña en una página web/revista/lo que sea,  sería muy, muy útil!! y nosotros estaremos muy agradecidos!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I am Aghavni. I very excited to join INDIEGOGO. This is my first experience in fundraising. </p>
<p>I would like to share a little about myself. I have started to play piano, when I was 6 years old and have started to compose music when I was 7 years old. During my teens I was a professional pianist. I have won several musical competitions, participated in musical festivals and accompanied several bands. </p>
<p>I have tried to associate my career in the music industry but I recognize that this field has high barrier to entry.  For my living I have worked in several jobs not connected with music. However, I dont last too long as the boredom hits. The only area that brings at most satisfaction is music. Music is my passion. I have decided to do everything that takes to stick around music and related works.</p>
<p>I have composed a lot of pieces, unfortunately I did not have a chance to record them all, I have some records you can check it in my Youtube channel <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqcdzVWLNb0dNUoYO15_IqQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqcdzVWLNb0dNU...</a></p>
<p>Most of my videos and records are not professional, but I did it with a lot of love.</p>
<p>I mostly share it with my family and friends.  They encourage me to take it to the next level, especially after I introduced them my last piece ""Farfallina"". I am super excited to move it to professional level.  I would love to record it with the support of professional staff. </p>
<p>This is a great start for my goals to come true. </p>
<p>After recording ""farfallina"", I will have a lot of motivation to start working on my new Album. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
</div><div>
<p>My mission is to pick my best composition so far and record them in a good studio with great acoustics to get the full feel of the composition. Further I would like to add video to make it as a complete clip. This would enable me to have a good start in this field. As per my best estimate we would require $2000 for complete job. Any thing beyond this sum would allow me to enhance certain aspects and better edits for the video.</p>
<p>In case,  If I do not reach my goal of  $2000,  I will just use the contribution to record the composition. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact </h3>
<p>This can give me a great start towards my music career that I have always aspired. I have several pieces that resonates positive vibe among the listener. I am quite assured that I can make long strides but all I require is a start.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>My job allows me to meet my living and create some good music. But I do not have the luxury to record or promote my work. This piece would be my name card to reach out various channels.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>My dears, if  at this moment you are not able to contribute, please  like and share  my music campaign with Indiegogo share tools. It will be very  much appreciated.</p>
<p>THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION.</p>
<p>EACH SUPPORT IS ONE STEP TOWARDS MY GOAL TO HAVE PROFESSIONAL RECORD AND VIDEO.</p>

Hello all,
I am Aghavni. I very excited to join INDIEGOGO. This is my first experience in fundraising. 
I would like to share a little about myself. I have started to play piano, when I was 6 years old and have started to compose music when I was 7 years old. During my teens I was a professional pianist. I have won several musical competitions, participated in musical festivals and accompanied several bands. 
I have tried to associate my career in the music industry but I recognize that this field has high barrier to entry.  For my living I have worked in several jobs not connected with music. However, I dont last too long as the boredom hits. The only area that brings at most satisfaction is music. Music is my passion. I have decided to do everything that takes to stick around music and related works.
I have composed a lot of pieces, unfortunately I did not have a chance to record them all, I have some records you can check it in my Youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqcdzVWLNb0dNU...
Most of my videos and records are not professional, but I did it with a lot of love.
I mostly share it with my family and friends.  They encourage me to take it to the next level, especially after I introduced them my last piece ""Farfallina"". I am super excited to move it to professional level.  I would love to record it with the support of professional staff. 
This is a great start for my goals to come true. 
After recording ""farfallina"", I will have a lot of motivation to start working on my new Album. 
 
What We Need & What You Get

My mission is to pick my best composition so far and record them in a good studio with great acoustics to get the full feel of the composition. Further I would like to add video to make it as a complete clip. This would enable me to have a good start in this field. As per my best estimate we would require $2000 for complete job. Any thing beyond this sum would allow me to enhance certain aspects and better edits for the video.
In case,  If I do not reach my goal of  $2000,  I will just use the contribution to record the composition. 
 

The Impact 
This can give me a great start towards my music career that I have always aspired. I have several pieces that resonates positive vibe among the listener. I am quite assured that I can make long strides but all I require is a start.

Risks & Challenges
My job allows me to meet my living and create some good music. But I do not have the luxury to record or promote my work. This piece would be my name card to reach out various channels.

Other Ways You Can Help
My dears, if  at this moment you are not able to contribute, please  like and share  my music campaign with Indiegogo share tools. It will be very  much appreciated.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION.
EACH SUPPORT IS ONE STEP TOWARDS MY GOAL TO HAVE PROFESSIONAL RECORD AND VIDEO.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>When I was sick with Lyme's Disease. Fighting for my life. I walked into my darkest shadows to find my own light. Fighting this inner battle. This inner balance. Between  my shadow self and finding my light within. This experience of not giving up the fight. To win the race called life. When I felt like I was falling apart. Falling into one million pieces. This was the hardest thing I have ever experienced. And in this inner fight. I found this inner fire. The more I got back up after falling apart inwards. I found more and more light within. When I was physically drained. I looked inwards and found this passion. This burning in my heart. To keep going no matter what. This inner fire began to spread to every part of my experience. Of my every part of my physical being. Letting go of the inner physical pain. Releasing the emotional pain and allowing that fire to burn down everything that was there. Watching this pain and suffering burn away to ashes. This flame of love. Overcoming the suffering and feeling the Sunshine on my shoulders. Feeling that warmth like it was the first time. ""Like I can count on you like I count on the sun and I will rest in you like I rest in the sun. To burn that Lyme's Disease away. To become my full authentic self. Was the hardest battle. But the most amazing and beautiful experience ever. This ""Fire Dance Project"" is sharing this experience through music, dance, expression through words and movement. This project is a two hour show/production. That Kopo Magic has experienced fully. Using his passion as a composer and producer. Singer/songwriter and musician and the world of magic. The world of imagination and magic. Kopo Magic will be sharing his story and experiences through ""Fire Dance"".  </p>

<strong>Here's where you come in.</strong><br/> </h2>
<p>I need you to become part of the <strong>imaJJine naTTion!</strong></p>
<p>imaJJine’s “Love Songs &amp; Lullabies is an album that is based in jazz but incorporates, blues, gospel, and a little bit of soul! Melodic, cerebral, uplifting and accessible, it will make you smile, cry, relax and dance. Tranquil and powerful it’s set to spread worldwide.</p>
<p>Completing a project of this magnitude on this level for an independent artist requires an enormous amount of time, dedication, perseverance  and financial investment.</p>
<p>A grant from the Ontario Arts Council got the project started. I have continued to finance it myself. But, as I move into the final stages of production, recording, mixing, mastering, album design, video, printing, and promotion I am looking to raise money to cover the final costs with the goal of completing the album to the same high standard as I started. Please know that absolutely every gesture towards helping me reach these goals even if it just means spreading the word about the campaign and/or sharing the music with friends means the world to me.</p>

<h3><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;""><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;"">Breve resumen</font></font></h3>
<p>Desde los tres años he trabajado mi voz con mucho amor y disciplina, al mismo tiempo que he adelantado en mis estudios.</p>
<p>Actualmente curso V semestre de Comunicación Social y he grabado más de 40  temas musicales. Participé en La Voz Teens de Caracol Televisión. He sido ganadora de dos certámenes nacionales en la modalidad canción inédita. Y obtuve el primer puesto en un concurso internacional en la ciudad de México.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;""><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;"">Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes</font></font></h3>
<p>Necesito tu colaboración para invertir en mi proyecto, el cual está conformado así: </p>
<p>10% para la grabación del tema</p>
<p>20% para la realización del video </p>
<p>70% para promoción (CD´s, redes sociales, prensa, televisión, radio, catálogo y presentaciones en vivo) </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;""><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;"">El impacto</font></font></h3>
<p><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;""><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;"">El sueño de todo artista es trascender, pero se requiere de apoyo tanto de las personas, como de los medios de comunicación, y esto implica gastos en desplazamientos, manutención, promoción y más.</font></font></p>
<p>La música hace parte del ser humano. Mis temas contienen un mensaje que logra conectar a través de múltiples sentimientos, lo que hace esto posible, es que para mí la música no es un hobbie. Es mi proyecto de vida.</p>

Desde los tres años he trabajado mi voz con mucho amor y disciplina, al mismo tiempo que he adelantado en mis estudios.
Actualmente curso V semestre de Comunicación Social y he grabado más de 40  temas musicales. Participé en La Voz Teens de Caracol Televisión. He sido ganadora de dos certámenes nacionales en la modalidad canción inédita. Y obtuve el primer puesto en un concurso internacional en la ciudad de México.

Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes
Necesito tu colaboración para invertir en mi proyecto, el cual está conformado así: 
10% para la grabación del tema
20% para la realización del video 
70% para promoción (CD´s, redes sociales, prensa, televisión, radio, catálogo y presentaciones en vivo) 
 

El impacto
El sueño de todo artista es trascender, pero se requiere de apoyo tanto de las personas, como de los medios de comunicación, y esto implica gastos en desplazamientos, manutención, promoción y más.
La música hace parte del ser humano. Mis temas contienen un mensaje que logra conectar a través de múltiples sentimientos, lo que hace esto posible, es que para mí la música no es un hobbie. Es mi proyecto de vida.
 

Riesgos y Desafíos
En estos 15 años de carrera musical he tocado muchas puertas, he hablado con demasiadas personas, he tenido al rededor de 200 entrevistas en radio y más de 50 en televisión, no ha sido nada fácil. Aunque me han repetido mil veces que es imposible, pero yo sigo trabajando para lograrlo porque lo estoy haciendo posible.
Esta modalidad de financiamiento es una gran oportunidad que quiero aprovechar. Conozco muchos casos de personas que como tú, apoyan el talento y creen en la juventud. 
 

Puedes ayudar de otras formas
Si tu colaboración no es monetaria, ayúdame a compartir esta campaña con personas o instituciones que creas que puedan hacerlo.

I've been a professional musician in NC and in NYC, a software engineer at Data General in Research Triangle Park, NC, a cab driver in Asheville, and now I'm entering politics. My first experience in politics was as a candidate for Asheville City Council in 2015. I didn't win, but I learned a lot. For one thing, a solid campaign manager is essential. If I raise the funds, I'll interview some individuals (I have some in mind) and pay them for the first six months with funds from this IndieGogo campaign after I file the Notice of Candidacy. After that, if they're competent, we'll raise enough money to get them paid for the remainder of the campaign.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What we need:</h3>Our goal is $20,000. The cost of filing a Notice of Candidacy is $1,474, 1% of the Governor's salary (too high, in my opinion). We'll also need to hire a campaign manager at a cost of approximately $18,000 for the first 6 months of the campaign. I don't have that laying around, so I'm asking you to help by pledging some small amount of money and, very importantly, sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, and anywhere else you like, and also <i>talking about it</i> to people.<p></p>
<h3>What you'll get:</h3>It's pretty simple: if I raise enough money, you'll get one smart, caring individual on the ballot who will do his best to run an excellent campaign, and a campaign manager to handle the details. And we'll regularly update you on our progress, probably by releasing YouTube videos. That's it. I mean, I certainly hope that's enough !</div><div>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I used to call myself a Democrat, but now I see the whole Democrat/Republican, Conservative/Liberal fight as a waste of time and energy that divides good people and keeps us from moving forward together. Both sides have good points. Both sides have bad points. I don't want to fight. It's just not fun. But I'll fight if I have to because I'm tired of watching what we're doing to ourselves. I want to have respectful conversations with people of differing opinions, find common ground and implement creative solutions to our problems. Musicians do this, so politicians can, too. I want to make sure we introduce good laws and get bad laws off the books. You lawyers out there know there are some pretty bad laws on the books that are constraining our residents and our communities from being able to <b>live the lives we deserve</b>.</span><br/></p>
<p>The primary issue that concerns me is that so many people know that the United States educational system is woefully inadequate. It is my goal for <b>North Carolina to lead the way in providing excellent education in the United States</b>. If we can do this, so many other problems will be solved.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>If we exceed the goal:</h3>
<p></p>
<p>This is an ALL OR NOTHING campaign (like Kickstarter). I only get the funds if we reach the goal. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Any funds we raise over the $20,000 goal will go to the Sphere College Project's fundraising campaign at gofundme.com/sphere.</span></p>
<p><b>So...</b> all of you musicians and software engineers who have been frustrated for so long with how things are being run, whether you're a Democrat or Republican or (like me) Independent, please consider pledging enough money for us to find out exactly how far a highly educated, caring person who isn't afraid to speak truth can go.</p> </div> <div> <h3>

If I raise the funds, I'll interview some individuals (I have some in mind) and pay them for the first six months with funds from this IndieGogo campaign after I file the Notice of Candidacy. After that, if they're competent, we'll raise enough money to get them paid for the remainder of the campaign.

What we need:Our goal is $20,000. The cost of filing a Notice of Candidacy is $1,474, 1% of the Governor's salary (too high, in my opinion). We'll also need to hire a campaign manager at a cost of approximately $18,000 for the first 6 months of the campaign. I don't have that laying around, so I'm asking you to help by pledging some small amount of money and, very importantly, sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, and anywhere else you like, and also talking about it to people.
What you'll get:It's pretty simple: if I raise enough money, you'll get one smart, caring individual on the ballot who will do his best to run an excellent campaign, and a campaign manager to handle the details. And we'll regularly update you on our progress, probably by releasing YouTube videos. That's it. I mean, I certainly hope that's enough !
My platform:
I used to call myself a Democrat, but now I see the whole Democrat/Republican, Conservative/Liberal fight as a waste of time and energy that divides good people and keeps us from moving forward together. Both sides have good points. Both sides have bad points. I don't want to fight. It's just not fun. But I'll fight if I have to because I'm tired of watching what we're doing to ourselves. I want to have respectful conversations with people of differing opinions, find common ground and implement creative solutions to our problems. Musicians do this, so politicians can, too. I want to make sure we introduce good laws and get bad laws off the books. You lawyers out there know there are some pretty bad laws on the books that are constraining our residents and our communities from being able to live the lives we deserve.
The primary issue that concerns me is that so many people know that the United States educational system is woefully inadequate. It is my goal for North Carolina to lead the way in providing excellent education in the United States. If we can do this, so many other problems will be solved.

If we exceed the goal:

This is an ALL OR NOTHING campaign (like Kickstarter). I only get the funds if we reach the goal. Any funds we raise over the $20,000 goal will go to the Sphere College Project's fundraising campaign at gofundme.com/sphere.
So... all of you musicians and software engineers who have been frustrated for so long with how things are being run, whether you're a Democrat or Republican or (like me) Independent, please consider pledging enough money for us to find out exactly how far a highly educated, caring person who isn't afraid to speak truth can go.   
Other Ways You Can Help

 Maybe you don't have funds to contribute right now. That's ok, you can help by talking about this campaign and sharing it on various social networking sites. Let's get the word out!
Thanks!

You'll find all the chart-toppers and all the up-and-coming bands in one app. Jaytraxx makes it easy to discover brand new music that you've never heard before, and also makes it easier for Independent bands and artists to have their music heard by the world.</p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Community comes before the labels</h3> <p>More and more we're seeing the music industry dominated and controlled by money-hungry labels that control the charts and therefore control what you hear, however Jaytraxx puts the power right into the hands of the community. All your favourite artists are still there, but indie artists are right there on the homepage ready to be discovered, whether they have a record deal or not*</p>
<p><br/></p>

<h3>What makes Jaytraxx so great?</h3>
<div>Apart from it's community music focus, Jaytraxx is packed with fun and useful features that will transform how you listen to music</div>
<div>- Want to share a playlist/album/song with a friend? Just open up whatever you want to share and shake your phone to instantly send it<br/>
</div>
<div>- Hear a great song on the radio or at a party and you want to save it for later? Open up Jaytraxx and turn your phone upside down, Jaytraxx will listen out for music and add it to your saved songs as soon as it recognizes</div>
<div>- Shake your phone on the search page and Jaytraxx will instantly play new music you'll like based on your listening history</div>
<div>- Save all of your playlists so you can listen later (even without an internet connection)</div>
<br/>
<h3>Why shouldn't I just use iTunes or Google Play?</h3>
<div>iTunes and Google Play are great music stores, but with Jaytraxx you can listen to as much music as you want at a fraction of the price. Instead of buying an album or single you can stream it along with millions more and still support the artists, all for the equivalent of buying one album a month.</div>

</div><p><br/></p></div>","What is Jaytraxx? Jaytraxx is a music streaming service that includes and supports independent artists. You'll find all the chart-toppers and all the up-and-coming bands in one app. Jaytraxx makes it easy to discover brand new music that you've never heard before, and also makes it easier for Independent bands and artists to have their music heard by the world.   
Community comes before the labels More and more we're seeing the music industry dominated and controlled by money-hungry labels that control the charts and therefore control what you hear, however Jaytraxx puts the power right into the hands of the community. All your favourite artists are still there, but indie artists are right there on the homepage ready to be discovered, whether they have a record deal or not*

    What it looks like We've been designing Jaytraxx for over 18 months, making sure the details are ironed out and picture perfect





Among more over at www.jaytraxx.com


What makes Jaytraxx so great?
Apart from it's community music focus, Jaytraxx is packed with fun and useful features that will transform how you listen to music
- Want to share a playlist/album/song with a friend? Just open up whatever you want to share and shake your phone to instantly send it

- Hear a great song on the radio or at a party and you want to save it for later? Open up Jaytraxx and turn your phone upside down, Jaytraxx will listen out for music and add it to your saved songs as soon as it recognizes
- Shake your phone on the search page and Jaytraxx will instantly play new music you'll like based on your listening history
- Save all of your playlists so you can listen later (even without an internet connection)

Why shouldn't I just use iTunes or Google Play?
iTunes and Google Play are great music stores, but with Jaytraxx you can listen to as much music as you want at a fraction of the price. Instead of buying an album or single you can stream it along with millions more and still support the artists, all for the equivalent of buying one album a month.

We want Jaytraxx to be possible from anywhere, that's why we're developing for a huge variety of devices:

<h3>The Backstory....</h3>
<p>As many of you know, I am Ruzz, Gretsch endorsed guitar slinger from Bristol UK. I started Ruzz Guitar's Blues Revue back in 2014 to enable me to play all the genres of music that I love that have come from the Blues, without restrictions. A lot has happened to date since I started the band including the birth of my dream line-up, a band with a killer Blues horn section. The support from all our friends since the start of this line-up has been fantastic and I can't thank you enough. Because of the support, we have decided to kick things up a gear for the next album and it's release party and we need your help!</p>
<h3>Our Plan....</h3>
<p>We are currently writing songs for the next ""Big Band"" album for which we are aiming to record with an increased horn section, think The Brian Setzer Orchestra and you'll be pretty close to the idea! Also planned for the album will be a few other instruments and some special guests... This is the next big push in my career, one step closer to my dream of having this line-up permanently.  With your help, it will enable us to make this a reality! </p>
<p>There will be an album release party which we will record for a future live album release and we will unveil the increased band size for ONE NIGHT ONLY! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get...</h3>
<p>To enable us to do this, we're going to need as close to £10.000 as possible. This money will cover the costs of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Studio Time </li>
<li>Musician hire </li>
<li>Venue hire for the release party </li>
<li>Printing, Design, Promotion</li>
</ul>
<p>In return for your generous donations we have listed various perks on this site to say a huge thank you to everyone for their continued support... these range from getting a copy of the album BEFORE it's release date, getting YOUR NAME in the album credits AND the credits for the Live album and a LIFETIME GUEST LIST pass to any show of your choosing.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is something I feel very passionate about, I feel that I have something different to offer to the music scene in this country with this band, the blending of Blues/R'n'B and Rockabilly with the ""Big Band"" horns. With your help, we can bring this sound to more people, create bigger and better shows, bigger and better future albums and much more!</p>
<p>Our friends and fans have been incredibly supportive already with this project, any help with this next step is very much appreciated! Even if we don't hit our target, all money donated by all of you will still go towards building up to this next level!</p>

You are welcome to make donations, but the perks all include tickets and that is what it is all about!<br/><br/>This concert is not endorsed, sanctioned or associated with EON, Danjaq, the James Bond Films. No use of any footage or images from the film will be used during the performance. Performing Rights fees will be paid on the live performance as applicable.</p><p><br/><u><strong>ABOUT</strong></u></p><p>The fact that you are even reading this means you are a fan. Well, I am too. I've been a James Bond fan since I was a boy and a John Barry / James Bond Music fan almost as long.<br/><br/>Luckily enough, as a Professional Trumpeter, I've got to play so many wonderful pieces and scores, but many of those amazing John Barry cues from the Bond films have eluded me as a performer, and you as a listener (in a live setting).<br/><br/>I want to right that wrong, and bring this one off opportunity to you: a live performance of the score with a huge 100 piece Symphony Orchestra and Choir.<br/><br/>Crowdfunding is not necessarily used in this way...but the idea is to use this platform to sell you tickets, without risk to me. Basically, if we don't sell enough tickets, the concert doesn't go ahead and you get refunded. Donations are welcome, but not expected at all.<br/><br/>Hopefully, if you haven't yet seen Q The Music, you will know about us at the very least. To summarise, I have given the last 14 years of my life, in between working as a full time Trumpeter, to a passion project: creating a James Bond Tribute Band &amp; Concert that has delighted every Bond fan that has seen it. A bold statement: but go to our website at <a href=""http://www.QTheMusicShow.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.QTheMusicShow.com</a> and check out the testimonials. No stone is left unturned with us, and the whole show from top to toe is done with a love of Bond that oozes through what we do, is second to NONE and delivered by some incredible musicians I have handpicked over the years.<br/><br/>Last year we were honoured to be chosen to play at dear Sir Roger Moore's Memorial Event at Pinewood Studios, having appeared at several Bond fan events in the past few years. If you are still not sure, try and speak to other Bond fans in Bond groups who have seen us - there are plenty who have now.<br/><br/>Now I desperately want to take our concerts a level up and do something that so many Bond fans have wanted, and asked me about over the years: a concert performance of every John Barry cue from Moonraker.<br/><br/>The size, scale and logistics of doing this are pretty huge, which is why I have not taken it on until now. For example, just the cost of the Orchestra and Arrangements for the night would be over £30,000, and then I have to factor in venue hire, PRS costs, VAT costs and all the other costs associated with concerts.<br/><br/>So, let me throw this back to you. How much do you Bond fans REALLY want it? <br/><br/>I can do it. I can ABSOLUTELY give you this amazing concert we have all long craved.<br/><br/>If you all back it, I will have no problem in delivering the Concert you want and you (we!) deserve.<br/><br/>For those who don't know, my background is Orchestral. I come from a family steeped deep in that tradition, with my great-aunt Maisie, the first ever Professional Female Trombone player (in the Halle Orchestra) and my father Paul, who was Co-Principal Trumpet in both the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. He in fact worked with John Barry on at least one occasion, and those of you who own the ""Moviola"" recordings of Barry - my Dad plays the Trumpet solos on both The Specialist &amp; Dances With Wolves.<br/><br/>Probably more importantly, I myself studied at one of the leading music conservatoires in the World: The Royal College Of Music in London, where I gained a music degree and was awarded the David Mason Trumpet prize (David Mason played The Beatles' Penny Lane Trumpet solo!). After graduating I freelanced in London with the English National Opera, BBC Symphony Orchestra and London Philharmonic Orchestra amongst others, before moving away from that scene but working as a full time Trumpeter.<br/><br/>My point with all this is to assure you, I have the skill, expertise, contacts, passion and experience to deliver this concert you deserve and want as Bond fans.<br/><br/>If successful in achieving the target, I will give every inch of my heart and soul to putting on a performance that you will NEVER forget...but you will need to be there on that night. It will not be recorded...and I suspect (bearing in mind it has never happened until now) this may be the one opportunity to see the music from that film performed in concert. <br/><br/>The venue is lined up and very excited about the idea - I just need the backing from you now to confirm it and start the preparation for it.<br/><br/>It would be held at <u><strong>The Wycombe Swan (in High Wycombe, Berkshire)</strong></u> which holds over 1,000. <br/>The date of the concert would be <u><strong>Saturday 26th January 2019.</strong></u><br/><br/>Venue Details: <a href=""https://wycombeswan.co.uk/Online/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://wycombeswan.co.uk/Online/</a></p><p><br/>Please note: please do not make any travel or accommodation arrangements before funding is successful.<br/><br/>If funding IS successful, you will then be allocated your seat in the area you purchase with your backing pledge, or if you wish (for a small fee of £10) you can select your seat. I'm happy to try to work with you waive that fee if there is some flexibility in exactly the seat you want..I'm just trying to avoid 100 people demanding the same 2 seats!<br/><br/>If you are purchasing more than one ticket, please purchase them separately, and email us on thelondonshowband@hotmail.com to let us know which people to put together.<br/><br/><u><strong>If we do not hit the target by the date stated (May 6th) any backers will be automatically refunded and the project will not go ahead.</strong></u></p><p><br/>So what are we waiting for? Let's get this show on the road. Most importantly, I cannot allocate a budget to advertising this. It is down to you - the Bond fans - to share this, and encourage your friends to pledge and come and see it. Due to the planning needed and the Indiegogo limitations, we now have 60 days to hit the target - a pretty huge target!<br/><br/>Just like the Moonraker knows, his dream may come true someday....<br/><br/> </p></div>","Moonraker Concert - SATURDAY 26TH JANUARY 2019@ WYCOMBE SWAN, St Mary St, High Wycombe HP11 2XENOTE: DEADLINE TO PURCHASE TICKETS 6th May 2018!PLEASE NOTE:This is a method to sell tickets to you whilst minimising your risk.

No stone is left unturned with us, and the whole show from top to toe is done with a love of Bond that oozes through what we do, is second to NONE and delivered by some incredible musicians I have handpicked over the years.Last year we were honoured to be chosen to play at dear Sir Roger Moore's Memorial Event at Pinewood Studios, having appeared at several Bond fan events in the past few years. If you are still not sure, try and speak to other Bond fans in Bond groups who have seen us - there are plenty who have now.Now I desperately want to take our concerts a level up and do something that so many Bond fans have wanted, and asked me about over the years: a concert performance of every John Barry cue from Moonraker.The size, scale and logistics of doing this are pretty huge, which is why I have not taken it on until now. For example, just the cost of the Orchestra and Arrangements for the night would be over £30,000, and then I have to factor in venue hire, PRS costs, VAT costs and all the other costs associated with concerts.So, let me throw this back to you. How much do you Bond fans REALLY want it? I can do it. I can ABSOLUTELY give you this amazing concert we have all long craved.If you all back it, I will have no problem in delivering the Concert you want and you (we!) deserve.For those who don't know, my background is Orchestral. I come from a family steeped deep in that tradition, with my great-aunt Maisie, the first ever Professional Female Trombone player (in the Halle Orchestra) and my father Paul, who was Co-Principal Trumpet in both the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. He in fact worked with John Barry on at least one occasion, and those of you who own the ""Moviola"" recordings of Barry - my Dad plays the Trumpet solos on both The Specialist & Dances With Wolves.Probably more importantly, I myself studied at one of the leading music conservatoires in the World: The Royal College Of Music in London, where I gained a music degree and was awarded the David Mason Trumpet prize (David Mason played The Beatles' Penny Lane Trumpet solo!). After graduating I freelanced in London with the English National Opera, BBC Symphony Orchestra and London Philharmonic Orchestra amongst others, before moving away from that scene but working as a full time Trumpeter.My point with all this is to assure you, I have the skill, expertise, contacts, passion and experience to deliver this concert you deserve and want as Bond fans.If successful in achieving the target, I will give every inch of my heart and soul to putting on a performance that you will NEVER forget...but you will need to be there on that night. It will not be recorded...and I suspect (bearing in mind it has never happened until now) this may be the one opportunity to see the music from that film performed in concert. The venue is lined up and very excited about the idea - I just need the backing from you now to confirm it and start the preparation for it.It would be held at The Wycombe Swan (in High Wycombe, Berkshire) which holds over 1,000. The date of the concert would be Saturday 26th January 2019.Venue Details: https://wycombeswan.co.uk/Online/Please note: please do not make any travel or accommodation arrangements before funding is successful.If funding IS successful, you will then be allocated your seat in the area you purchase with your backing pledge, or if you wish (for a small fee of £10) you can select your seat. I'm happy to try to work with you waive that fee if there is some flexibility in exactly the seat you want..I'm just trying to avoid 100 people demanding the same 2 seats!If you are purchasing more than one ticket, please purchase them separately, and email us on thelondonshowband@hotmail.com to let us know which people to put together.If we do not hit the target by the date stated (May 6th) any backers will be automatically refunded and the project will not go ahead.So what are we waiting for? Let's get this show on the road. Most importantly, I cannot allocate a budget to advertising this. It is down to you - the Bond fans - to share this, and encourage your friends to pledge and come and see it. Due to the planning needed and the Indiegogo limitations, we now have 60 days to hit the target - a pretty huge target!Just like the Moonraker knows, his dream may come true someday....",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What is <span style=""color: #333399;"">Riffer</span>?</h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Like Airbnb, Riffer is an online marketplace that, instead of providing lodging options, makes it simple to find the perfect musician to perform at your next event, with no membership costs. <a href=""http://www.riffermusic.com%C2%A0is"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.riffermusic.com is</a> open to anyone planning an event that is in need of a musical performer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What's our motivation?</h3>
<p>Organizing a concert is always stressful regardless of the size of the event. Despite the importance of music to life, musical bands and promoters often find it difficult to connect to each other. Normally <strong>event organizers</strong> (these can be bar owners or just a normal people) have to spend several hours finding the right artist. This is because they have to deal with the following problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Artist availability (must match with the event date)</li>
<li>Artist price (must match with the event budget)</li>
<li>Knowing the actual talent of the artist</li>
<li>Having security that the artist will show up</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left:-18.0pt;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:-18.0pt;"">These points take time to check by making calls, sending emails, and waiting for replies. As a result, in 90% of the cases, the same people are called because networks have been built where everyone knows each other. So, the event is basically organized exclusively because of interpersonal relationships. <strong>Artists </strong>face similar problems. They have no security of payment, even after the concert is over. And the date of the event itself could even be canceled.</p>

<p>Riffer is going to transform the way musicians are booked. No longer do event mangers and artists have to go through so much stress to organize an event as we offer additional exciting features on our platform including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast booking and transaction service</li>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What we do</h3>
<p>Our primary goal is to ensure that invisibility between promoters and bands is no longer an issue. Synergy between the two only gets better when onboarding to Riffer Music. They can find each other more easily, be it by genre of music or by location. Issues of secure transactions have been solved as we offer a secure payment system. We equally offer our clients an opportunity to pay royalty fees through Soundreef, a benefit that cannot be found elsewhere. Bookings can be made super-fast and come with a cancelation policy.</p>
<p>Additionally, during organized events, artists, promoters, and fans can stream live on all social media platforms. And we have plans to make accommodation for one night in a hostel free for bands. Promotion just got easier as fans are able to share their awesome musical experiences during concerts with the bands after the events. All of this can, in turn, be shared on all our social media platforms including Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. Interestingly, Riffer Music is a membership free platform for all. Now, with Riffer Music, artists and promoters can put all their eggs in one basket without any hassle. </p>

<h3>My name is Sarah Stephens!</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Howdy, folks!</p>
<p>My name is Sarah Stephens. I am songwriter based out of a small town on Sand Mountain, Alabama southeast of Huntsville. I love it here. I am professionally trained as a lawyer, interesting choice, right? Well, I started writing music at age 15, but then I was led in the direction of higher education for a long time. I practiced law for 3 years, and I could not find myself more unhappy in a career. </p>
<p>Music has and always will be my passion - songwriting in particular. If you have checked me out, you know I don't have mad vocal skills or guitar plucking abilities (wait until you see the clawhammer banjo, though)! I also play the mandolin.</p>
<p>I am launching my career in songwriting in my late twenties. I am married to the most wonderful man in the world, and you may have some legitimate questions as to why I need help launching this career with a background in practicing law. Well, to be honest, this is a huge financial endeavor, and there are a lot of upfront costs which I want to break down for you below:</p>

<li>Marketing and Business Coach</li>
<li>Voice Coach (Because people will still need to WANT to hear my music even if it is good, it needs to sound good)</li>
<li>Instrument Coaches (we all could use a little help)</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will allow me to fund my lifelong dream of being a songwriter. I've had this dream since I was fifteen years old, but fear kept me out of pursuing it. Well, here I am at almost 30, and I am finally taking the plunge.

<p>You've told us you wish you could listen to Bring the War Home from the comfort of YOUR Home. The video from our last show has almost 60 views so that speaks for itself. We listened.</p>
<p>And maybe the crappy outdoor recording of <strong>In Back of Grossifer's</strong> isn't quite hitting the spot.</p>
<p>Well, now you can with the hottest new EP you probably didn't ask for: Bring the War Home's self-titled debut EP!</p>
<p>God bless the market.</p>
<p>Speaking of, we want your money up front. They call it ""crowdfunding"" and it's great because we get your money up front. Depending on how much of your money we get, we might even give you extra shit! Think of it like pre-ordering, but with benefits.</p>
<p>How'd you get so lucky?!</p>

</h3> <p>In deciding to contribute to me, and my campaign, I hope you feel the passion that I have for helping people. I do know that Charity begins at home, and then spreads abroad. So, I must first make sure, my household is secure, and my bills are paid and I have transportation to and fro. I have given to others over the years and then realize I forgot to take care of my bills. Therefore, I'm positioning myself to get some for me, and some for my family, and then some for others.<br/></p> <ul> <li>The Organization's Website is FLOWMillionDollar.com. <br/>
</li> <li>My profile is on the ""Meet the Organizer"" page<br/>
</li> <li>I wrote a Musical Drama in 1996, and I need to Produce it, and raise funds<br/>
</li>
<li>I am the Producer and Host of the Internet TV Show, Wednesday's Woman, Live on Wednesday's, 10:30am (PST) on RMConAir.com</li>
<li>I also act as a Creative Content Producer for other shows on the RMC Network<br/>
</li> </ul> <p>I'm 54 years of age. Married, with 5 Children, and 2 Grands. I'm a church Musician and Praise and Worship Leader, for two churches. I have a desire and a personal need, to take my show on the road. At my age, I have to work smart and be wise, while I have enough voice, and energy, to make a few million. (smiles) I'm launching an LLC, which will cover the Music Production, Television Production, Performing Arts Workshops, and Business Management, that will be serving all of my business endeavors. I currently work, as the Assistant Manager of Roscoe's Media Center and the Personal Assistant, to Johnny Morris, General Manager of Roscoe's Media Center, and Roscoe's TV, in Los Angeles, CA.

</h3> <p>After conferring with my Business Consultant, $5500.00 is what I Need to launch ""Singing For Charity"" Musical Drama.<br/></p> <ul> <li>For Business Management: Filing The LLC., Opening the Account, Printing, Cost of the Venue = $1800.00</li>
<li>Music Production: 3-Musicians (4 Rehearsals &amp; the Show) Sound Tech, Pressing of 100 CD's = $1500.00</li>
<li>Television Production: (Internet &amp; Cable) 2-Cameras, Lights, Editing, Pressing of 100 DVDs, Production Manager = $1200.00</li>
<li>Performing Arts Workshops: Vocal, Dance, Drama = $1000.00<br/>
</li> <li>Our Perks will include: a Ticket to Attend, or a Link to Watch the Show Live; a T-Shirt, a CD, a DVD, and a Goody Bag.<br/>
</li> <li>Once June, 17th hits, and the clock strikes, all that we raise will be in. Based on what we have, we may have to skim off a few bills, and adjust our overall production, however, the show will go on!</li>
<li>I hope to make at least $5,000 in Tickets and Advertising sales, as well as the Cd, DVD and T-Shirt sales. I also plan to get Bookings for the Show, to build enough funds, to finance the Family Love Outreach Organization.<br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact I Believe, Will Be World Changing<br/>
</h3> <p>Since my work at RMC encompasses networking with over 30 show Producers per week, and their guests. I have been introduced to people from South Africa, West Africa and Jamaica. And then there are the people who live here in America that are Rappers, Actors and Sports Figures. To name a few, Mike Tyson, DJ Quick and Howard Hewitt. (Wow)<br/></p> <ul>
<li>As a Contributor to my project, I believe you will feel a sense of belonging. I wrote a song that says, Everybody Needs a Place to Call Home... Family is what I find is missing in the world today, and not to mention the loss of Love... I feel  all I do, and all that I am, is built, and based upon Love, and the Unity of Family, which also, happens to be the name of my Organization, since 2003, Family Love Outreach Workshop (FLOW) <br/>
</li>
<li>I once had a couple of websites built, Family Love Outreach.org, and FLOW 50 Project.com, which I had no control over, and now they are no longer in existence. However, everything is being placed on a new site, FLOWMillionDollarMarch.com, in which I have built, and have control over.<br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Taking Risks Is Inevitable; I Say It's A Challenge of Faith, Hope and Charity (LOVE)<br/>
</h3> <p> If I were to give some advice to any one seeking to reach their dreams and goals, I would say, handle as much of your own business and possible. Trust no one, not even yourself. All Faith, Perfect Peace, Self-Determination, Sharing and Caring! It's a Formula that when followed, brings good outcomes.<br/></p> <ul> <li>I was told by my Adopted Mother when I was around 9 years old that I needed psychiatric treatment... What The... Well, today some 44 years later, I've been called Crazy by a lot of my family and friends. Why? Because I move to my own beat, I sing and play my own music, I bake and eat my own cake... meaning I do things my way. I hear what they can't hear, I see what they can't see, I go where they can't go, and I do what they don't do. Why? I've been gifted with special abilities call creative energy mixed with Love and Compassion for All-Mankind, therefore, I have many close encounters with other kinds. Talk about staying prayed up! 24/7, spiritually suited to handle anything, any where and any time.  <br/>
</li> <li>That's why I'm Singing For Charity, because I feel I have been chosen, by the Most High, to do what I do, for the betterment of man-kind. Someone has to show what Love Looks Like, Feels Like, and Acts Like, so here I go, Singing for Charity, Dancing for Charity, Acting for Charity and Loving every bit of it!<br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>You Can Help Me. I Realize I Need Help!<br/>

Since I have a few dollars to spend, I'm getting fliers, and posters printed and distributed, and I'm going to purchase some E blasts, and make sure I inform some older people I know, who are retired and living large... (smiles)<br/>
</li> <li>Also, Indiegogo wants us to use the social media tools they have provided, which I think is great, because they have a built in audience and the more people connect, the larger the audience becomes, so it becomes a win win situation.<br/>

This campaign is so important due to the fact that I want to be a storyteller that relates to people and their every day problems, joys, struggles, and successes. Music has always been therapy to me and contributing to my fans' well-being is my purpose in this world. The world of music provides an escape from reality and at the same time provides people with the feeling that they aren't alone out there. Creating an album of any kind requires money. That's a simple fact that no one can argue. From the studio time itself, to musicians' time, to the reproduction of the actual album at the finish of the process, the money contributed to this campaign will help me live out one of my lifelong dreams and hopefully help others that purchase and follow my music. I live to have fun such as the time described in my song, ""Bourbon Breakdown"". Who doesn't love to let go of their worries and let loose?!!! There are also the realities of failed relationships which is something that is focused on in my original titled, ""The Door"". I'm a realistic person who is very in touch with my feelings and every song I write can relate to someone. I work hard when I sit down in a writing session to not only have a great hook that is catchy, but compose lyrics that not only make sense but can provoke feelings and connect to my demographic. I have proof that this has been successful because I was fortunate enough to open up for the band Blackhawk and was able to perform two of my originals for a crowd of a few hundred people. Not only were they pleased, but I had so many that made specific comments letting me know the job had been accomplished. They got it and they very much bought the things I tried to say in song. There are so many obstacles in the music world...especially as a female. At the same time, with my personality and perseverance I am more than capable of overcoming them. I treat people like people want to be treated. In fact, that is what my song, ""Small Town in Me"" is about. I have made so many fans in the past few years sharing music and can't wait to continue to make more. The fans are the most important thing to me and always will be. It would mean so much in your contributions if you could also share this with others and open them up to the world of Andrea Nicole. It takes a huge team and I want my music to spread as far as it possibly can. I have stories to tell and the more that hear the better. There are tools on here that will allow you to easily share and I ask that you please do so. Thanks so much for you time y'all and welcome to this amazing ride that you're embarking on with me!!!!</p><p>Love, </p><p>Andrea Nicole</p></div>","My name is Andrea Nicole and I am an artist/songwriter from a small town in Kentucky.

<p>Many people asked us why we can play guitar so well, some asked us to teach them, and then the others asked us to make a guitar lesson video. So, we just want to make their wishes happen. So they can learn guitar fast &amp; easily. If you help us to reach our goals on Indiegogo, that means you helped them to make this guitar lesson video happen.</p>
<p>When this lesson video happen, we will upload some Parts of this video which everyone can access it for free, but they can't watch this full video for free.

So you will be the first peoples who watch our video.</p>
<h3>What's In Our Lesson Video?</h3>
<p>We make this video for beginners whom wanted to be able to play guitar but they don't know how to learn and always had trouble whenever learning guitar. Because yeah, it's hard. We want to tell some method that make they can play guitar easier. The guitar lesson video include:</p>

<li>Fingering</li>
<li>How to read chord charts</li>
<li>Chords they should know</li>
<li>How to read tabs</li>
<li>Guitar scale</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>This video will be around 60 - 90 minutes.</p>

<h3>Where Will the Funding Go?</h3>
<p>We want to make this video in very good quality than our previous videos on Youtube so it'll be a watchable and enjoyfull guitar lesson video.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/CW6r3L1FHtc?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>If we reached our goals, we want to buy Music &amp; Studio equipments such as Guitar Pick ups, Mirrorles Camera, Video Mic, Portable Mic, LED Lightning, Action Cam, etc. So, it's not only for this video but also for our next video.</p>

<h3>How If We Don't Reach The Entire Goal?</h3>
<p>If we don't reach the  entire goal, we will keep make the video but the video wouldn't be as what we planned. Maybe the video quality will be kinda worse than the expectation. And the audio will not in high quality, so maybe the video will not be watchable and enjoyable.</p>

<h3>Who I am</h3>
<p>My name is Murat, I am a design director &amp; digital entrepeneur of 7 years based in Hackney, East London. I have helped launch products &amp; advertising at over 50 golliath brands such as Coca Cola, American Express and many more. Before being placed into the product &amp; advertising industry, I had a very humble and working class upbringing. Growing up in Hackney was once a very rough experience but now it's pretty different and calm with charming record shops and great coffee. Living here all my life I experienced a whole new world of cultures, foods and sounds that I have never ignored but only inherited.</p>
<p>Music for me has always been a number one passion and my taste for it has constantly been free, I believe this is due to growing up in a very racially mixed environment where different sounds were always around. When you open the doors to music from around the world, you get blown away with what artists can do with local instruments, ancient vocals and modern incorporations. By coming to IndieGOGO, I want to finally share these feelings and sensations with the world by combining my knowledge of international music with my expertise in the Entrepreneurial, Design &amp; Product industry.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484164861/njb0xfdnpcllidnu0fz5.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Idea</strong></h3>
<p>I have been a lover of music from a very young age, music has never been a mere sound that vibrates within my ear canals but a plethora of emotional feelings. To me it has been a journey, an experience that drifts me to another world which an artist has created exclusively for me at that moment. With mixblock I wan't everyone to get that hair on end feeling everytime I find a new artist that emotionally reacts with me.</p>
<p>The problem lies with traction and reach. There are so many artists out there that are mind blowing, but unfortunately the music industry never showcases real talent like them. We all love streaming technology, the practicality and ease of it can be very useful but new or foreign artists can even still be very hard to find for a western audience, an addition to this it's difficult to give their story with no physicality behind the sound.</p>
<p>Sales of vinyl in 2016 reached a 25-year high with over a 1000% increase as consumers young and old have once again embraced physical formats of music, we wan't to emphasize this by giving you the very best of it, delivered to your door. Beautifully curated and thoroughly explained to you, what you are receiving, where it's from and why it's so special.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Patti Paige.</p>
<p>I've been creating new songs inspired by my journeys - both as a child and an adult. Many of these journeys have been around the world to moving places, many more have been around my head impelling me to change.</p>
<p>After escaping the constraints of a so called 'normal' life, bringing up my children in a challenging relationship, I have found a new freedom through  music.</p>
<p>And what a freedom it has been! This year I was whisked away to Sweden to record an album, and now I would love to release this - not only for the entertaing original music, but to say thank you to those that have made it possible; and to say to everyone, anything is possible. Escape is possible. New lives are possible.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need to raise the money to duplicate the CD and covers. Anyone supporting me can either get a heartfelt THANK YOU or else a signed copy of the CD with other extras if you like - take a look at the perks.</p>

Not a lot is required. If I don't raise the full target I will at least be able to release a limited run.
 

Other Ways You Can HelpIt's horrible asking for money, so I've tried to ensure that all support gets a good reward - but even if you can't offer financial help please do consider sharing the campaign. Even a simple share is most helpful",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Welcome to Mananabango's Campaign!</h3>
<p>Hello, good people! We are Mananabango! For those of you that have never heard of us, we are an Independent Rock band from Louisville, Ky. We try to use our music as a platform to explore all facets of the type of sounds that inspire us from Rock of all decades to country, from punk to folk, from metal to gospel and just about anything else. We try to bring all this into a sound that could only be described with one word... Mananabango! We started as a husband and wife playing music together in our parent's guest room, and we hope to bring that kind of authentic love to something you can listen to.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Campaign:</h3>
<p>Here is what we are looking to accomplish. We have been painstakingly recording and producing our second album and so far we couldn't be happier with the results. We started walking ourselves through the process of when we released our first album and this is when we realized if we were going to get the final product out, we were going to need to ask for help.</p>
<p>We have set the campaign goal at $5000. Here are the things that this money will fund:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recording equipment overhauls: Hardware and Software ($850)</li>
<li>CD Mastering and Manufacturing ($1500)</li>
<li>Music Video production costs ($1100)</li>
<li>Book a small tour to help promote the album ($1000)</li>
<li>Digital Advertising campaign ($550)</li>
</ul>
<p>If we exceed the goal we will use the extra money to produce another music video for a third song, as a good deal of those are capital expenses and can be used toward another video. If we fail to reach this goal it will force us to reduce the size of the tour to compensate as well as bleed down the spending from the Marketing/Advertising budget.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Hope:</h3>
<p>Making music is a process that means so much for us. It is a way for us to connect with all types of people and reach out in a world that is becoming more and more disjointed by the day. We have a deep heritage in real, honest, music, and we want everyone to be a part of that. Technology has allowed people to bring art to market in ways that were unimaginable even decades ago. We want to touch lives through the shared experience of music.</p>
<p>We have been on this merry-go-round before and we learned so much putting out our first album. Among the things we learned is that no band is an island. Our successes so far have not been due to our hard work or talent, it was through the connections we made to fans, and to the network of supportive people that want to help bring your creative vision to life. This is because, ultimately, the music doesn't belong to us; music is universal, and we share the feeling it creates in the imaginations of people who hear it, and that is what we want to create, a human connection.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Ways to Help</h3>
<p>We obviously are asking for monetary assistance, and we don't do this lightly. Musicians as a group are not generally the most affluent, so, we understand the gravity of asking for donations. If you don't have the means to donate, you can still contribute! Please share this campaign with your friends and family, and talk with them about why supporting independent music is so important. Every little bit counts, and we appreciate you taking the time to even look at this campaign.</p>
<p>If you do decide to donate, we want to sincerely thank you for your generosity, and we hope to make the rewards generous and interesting so you feel you get your moneys worth.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Mananabango!</p>

<h2>Šta želimo da postignemo?</h2>
<p>Koncept DORTJOL FESTIVALA zasniva se na ideji da se umetnicima iz inostranstva pruža prilika dužeg boravka u glavnom gradu Srbije, Beogradu, tačnije na beogradskom kvartu Dorćolu,  tokom kojeg će u međusobnim susretima i susretima sa lokalnim muzičarima i građanima, razmeniti svoja muzička znanja, iskustva i kulturu.</p>
<p>Mi ne želimo da DORTJOL FESTIVAL bude događaj na koji će muzičari samo doći, odsvirati i otići. Kroz realizaciju DORTJOL FESTIVALA, želimo da Dorćol, Beograd i Srbija bude mesto sastanka, mesto interakcije, mesto gde će muzičari i građani učiti jedni od drugih.</p>
<p>U cilju realizacije ovog koncepta, obezbedili smo $9,250 vrednu podršku u finansijama i uslugama, kroz podršku od prijatelja DORTJOL FESTIVALA (Gete institut Srbije, Jahting klub ""Kej"", Supermarket Conceptstore) i privatne donacije.</p>

<li>Pokrijemo deo putnih troškova i nadoknade za muzičare</li>
<li>Obezbedimo prostore za koncerte (Jazz Club Mihailo Miša Blam, Dorćolsko narodno pozorište, KC Grad)</li>

<li>Ugostimo muzičare, kako priliči, sa autentičnom srpskom kuhinjom</li>
</ul>
<p>Naš cilj je da uz vašu pomoć prikupimo dodatnih $4,600 donacija, kako bismo u potpunosti realizovali koncept DORTJOL FESTIVALA.</p>
<h2><strong>What We Want to Achieve? </strong></h2>
<p>Concept of DORTJOL FESTIVAL is based on the idea to provide the chance of longer stay in Belgrade, Serbia, more precisely in Dorcol, to artists coming from different countries, where they will exchange their musical knowledge, experience and culture with Serbian musicians and the people of Belgrade. We have planned the programs of cultural exchange, musical education and recording sessions during the 5 festival days, as well as 6 live concerts. </p>
<p>We don’t want to make DORTJOL FESTIVAL a festival where musicians will just arrive to perform and leave. Through the realization of DORTJOL FESTIVAL, we want to make Dorćol, Belgrade and Serbia to be a place of the meeting, place of interaction, place where the musicians and citizen will learn from each other. </p>
<p>To achieve this, we have already managed to secure $9,250 worth of support in fundings and services, through the support of the of the Friends of DORTJOL FESTIVAL (Goethe Institute Serbia, Yachting Club “Kej”, Supermarket Conceptstore) and private donations. </p>
<p>Support we have received so far has enabled us to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Cover the part of the costs for travel costs and fees for the musicians </li>
<li>Secure venues for the live concerts (Jazz club Mihailo Misa Blam, Dorćolsko Narodno Pozoriste, KC Grad) </li>
<li>Secure the equipment needed for live concerts </li>
<li>Organize the opening event on the cruiser boat for the representatives of media, friends of DORTJOL FESTIVAL, donors and supporters </li>
<li>PR the event </li>
<li>Provide musicians coming from abroad with guided tours of Belgrade </li>
<li>Provide musicians with authentic Serbian food and cuisine during the festival from the green markets of Belgrade</li>
</ul>
<p>Our goal is to raise additional $4,600 of donations in order to fully realize the concept of DORTJOL FESTIVAL.</p>

Naš cilj je da uz vašu pomoć prikupimo dodatnih $4,600 donacija, kako bismo u potpunosti realizovali koncept DORTJOL FESTIVALA.
What We Want to Achieve? 
Concept of DORTJOL FESTIVAL is based on the idea to provide the chance of longer stay in Belgrade, Serbia, more precisely in Dorcol, to artists coming from different countries, where they will exchange their musical knowledge, experience and culture with Serbian musicians and the people of Belgrade. We have planned the programs of cultural exchange, musical education and recording sessions during the 5 festival days, as well as 6 live concerts. 
We don’t want to make DORTJOL FESTIVAL a festival where musicians will just arrive to perform and leave. Through the realization of DORTJOL FESTIVAL, we want to make Dorćol, Belgrade and Serbia to be a place of the meeting, place of interaction, place where the musicians and citizen will learn from each other. 
To achieve this, we have already managed to secure $9,250 worth of support in fundings and services, through the support of the of the Friends of DORTJOL FESTIVAL (Goethe Institute Serbia, Yachting Club “Kej”, Supermarket Conceptstore) and private donations. 
Support we have received so far has enabled us to: 

Cover the part of the costs for travel costs and fees for the musicians 
Secure venues for the live concerts (Jazz club Mihailo Misa Blam, Dorćolsko Narodno Pozoriste, KC Grad) 
Secure the equipment needed for live concerts 
Organize the opening event on the cruiser boat for the representatives of media, friends of DORTJOL FESTIVAL, donors and supporters 
PR the event 
Provide musicians coming from abroad with guided tours of Belgrade 
Provide musicians with authentic Serbian food and cuisine during the festival from the green markets of Belgrade

Our goal is to raise additional $4,600 of donations in order to fully realize the concept of DORTJOL FESTIVAL.

Šta nam treba od vas?
Cilj naše kampanje je da prikupimo $4,600. Vaša podrška će nam omogućiti da:

<h3>Planets are aligning, again...</h3>
<p>Mark Nguyen and Juan Andres Lizarazo (Juanlizh) are the songwriting duo known as When Planets Align.  Like Jupiter and Saturn, planets are aligning again as they prepare to release their latest album with the title track arriving on January 21, 2021.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>""The Death of Us"" album</h3>
<p>The title of the album may sound grim.  After all, it is inspired by a real tale of heartache and grief.</p>
<p>Juan's dramatic melodies and Mark's vivid lyrics together convey emotions and feelings of catharsis that many of us have experienced before whatever the loss.  We learn, grow and let go.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Universal emotions</h3>
<p>Given the pandemic, many of us can relate to loss and the lives we used to know...</p>
<p><i>""Weep, grieve and mourn, the death of us, what we had and knew"" (from ""The Death of Us"")</i></p>
<p>As romance and life itself is impermanent...</p>
<p><i>""Our plans, reality now shattered by impulse, You said, without warning, we’ve run our course"" (from ""Validation"")</i></p>
<p>But through loss there is growth...</p>
<p><i>""Still a chance or hope we can learn and grow? Or is this just a stepping stone?"" (from ""Stepping Stone"")</i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Producing music during a pandemic</h3>
<p>We have self-funded the production of the album in 2019-2020 and encountered recording delays due to the pandemic.  We managed to finish the production in recording studios in Bogota and Los Angeles and the final backing vocals from home (thanks Gabe &amp; Shalini!)</p>
<p>The incredible vocalists who expressed these stories are Boogiewhip, Diego Garcia, Shalini Varghese and Gabe Kubanda along with a talented group of studio musicians.</p>
<p>Special thanks to producers Federico Perez and Sergio Martinez in Bogota, with support from Joshua ""Cartier"" Cutsinger in Los Angeles.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Support with promotion</h3>
<p>We are seeking support to raise awareness for the album as its release alone will likely have limited impact without promotion.  We anticipate the promotional efforts will cost around $5000. </p>
<p>However, your support is also welcome without money and we completely understand given the challenging times.  Here are some ways you can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-Save or pre-order the song on Spotify, Apple Music and online before January 21, 2021.  You can find us at When Planets Align on Spotify/Apple or @wpamusic on Instagram and the Pre-Save link:  <a href=""https://ffm.to/zdkqoy0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://ffm.to/zdkqoy0</a>

""Still a chance or hope we can learn and grow? Or is this just a stepping stone?"" (from ""Stepping Stone"")

Producing music during a pandemic
We have self-funded the production of the album in 2019-2020 and encountered recording delays due to the pandemic.  We managed to finish the production in recording studios in Bogota and Los Angeles and the final backing vocals from home (thanks Gabe & Shalini!)
The incredible vocalists who expressed these stories are Boogiewhip, Diego Garcia, Shalini Varghese and Gabe Kubanda along with a talented group of studio musicians.
Special thanks to producers Federico Perez and Sergio Martinez in Bogota, with support from Joshua ""Cartier"" Cutsinger in Los Angeles.

Support with promotion
We are seeking support to raise awareness for the album as its release alone will likely have limited impact without promotion.  We anticipate the promotional efforts will cost around $5000. 
However, your support is also welcome without money and we completely understand given the challenging times.  Here are some ways you can help:

Pre-Save or pre-order the song on Spotify, Apple Music and online before January 21, 2021.  You can find us at When Planets Align on Spotify/Apple or @wpamusic on Instagram and the Pre-Save link:  https://ffm.to/zdkqoy0

Donate only if you are in a position to support

Gracias!  We are truly grateful for your support and please stay safe!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Introduction to Moi</h3>
<p>Hi! I am Rivita, if you've already met me then you know that I am a very hands on DIY person and I've been making music by myself for many years now and you probably know me because of music in the first place! </p>
<p>If you don't know me then let me quickly introduce myself. I have been making music since I was a kid, music has always been my number one best friend. When I was 20 years old, I finally got the opportunity to study music full time - this led me to London where I spent 4 years getting my Bachelors and then a Masters degree in Music. </p>
<p>After graduating, I went back home and spent an year just writing and releasing music. One of my music video, ""Listen"", went onto get nominated at various film festivals, this gave me a lot of confidence and I decided that maybe I should study a bit more. </p>
<p>I was awarded a Scholarship to study at Syracuse University, where I studied more about audio and video production. After finishing that program, I decided to put a pin in getting a Doctorate and wanted to focus on being an artist + producer. </p>
<p>Since then, I have continued to release music and videos with a lot of help from family and friends. Slowly, I'm growing as an artist, producer and composer. </p>
<p>Today, as I write this, I have written a lot of songs that now need to be produced, it is my dream to release an album and to be able to release a new song every 4 to 6 weeks to build momentum. </p>
<p>Through this campaign, you will be contributing towards the fees I pay to my publicist who shares my music with radio presenters, to the mastering engineer who polishes the music, to a photographer, videographer and retouch artist who will help me with the artwork, to the musicians who perform on my songs and for the equipment I need to record and deliver my music. </p>
<p>This campaign is important to me because I believe everyone deserves to live their dream and do what they love without having to worry about money or resources. I like working with other people and when someone performs on my songs, it makes the songs more special and beautiful, having said that I want to be able to pay the people I work with. </p>
<p>This is my first time asking for money for my music from you, my friends and followers - and I do so because over the years, I've come to respect the art and craft of making music more, I believe that if I can make the music I want and keep it going, then other girls can too. In such a conquest, every penny counts and is more precious than any amount of wealth in this world. </p>
<p>I leave you with these thoughts and I want to thank you for your contribution in the making of my music! &lt;3 </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I need &amp; What's in it for you: </h3>
<ul>
<li>How much funding I need and where it is going? As you are aware I am a DIY artist and I produce, record and mix my own music, this means that I usually end up spending money on equipment. Some of the plugins I use, now come with subscription models (plugins are like apps) and I spend around $50 per month. I will hire session musicians, usually I hire guitarists, drummers and bass players, and they cost anywhere between $50 to $400 depending on their experience. I pay for publicity, a good publicist costs around $2000 per campaign. I will pay for mastering of the songs, my budget is $225 per song. </li>
<li>For every contribution you make, I will be giving you something - you can get a digital download of my song, stickers, CDs and merchandize, a music lesson, hand written lyrics. </li>
<li>If I don't reach my goal, I am still making music on on-going basis, and I will still use whatever money I raise through this campaign towards making new music. The more money I raise, the more music I get to make and vice verse! </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know the difference their contribution will make:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must ask why is my project valuable? Ever since I have ventured out into the world and started making music, I realized I don't quite fit in. I'm a 4'10"" tall girl from India (sometimes when I go to a networking event, I have to jump up and wave at someone so that they'd see me). For many years and even still, I felt very strange saying I am a musician, and even now that I am somewhat ""established"" I get a eye-roll or I get asked if I teach singing. But actually, there's much more to what I do, I am a trained professional, I understand microphones and bit-rates, I write, record, arrange, compose, produce and have a vision for the project before it is executed. I budget, I pay people, I fight over little details (!). Did you know, there are only 2% women producers out in the world? WHAAAT!? </li>
<li>I have been making music for 10 years now, with every release I have moved a little forward, when I released my first song in 2014, I could have never imaged that 5 years later I will be on BBC London and Rolling Stone Magazine. I truly believe that the more music I make, the more I learn and the more I am in a position to not only contribute to my own artist project but also to others. </li>
<li>I have received e-mails from teenage girls in Brazil who look up to me because I self-release and I am head strong. As I write this, I think about myself when I was 12 years old, wondering how do I put chords to the melodies inside my head. Over the years, I had more and more questions and to this day, I sit and read books trying to figure out the answer. Today, my question is how does a girl pay for the album that she wants to create and find all the right people who would help her pave the way. By being a part of my project, you're also telling every girl out there, whether she is in India, Brazil, South Africa, Argentina, or the United States that no dream is too big and there is always someone out there listening.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The number one risk is that sometimes, I hire someone and they do not deliver the quality that I like or I just don't agree with their work. Often times, in these cases, I would try to ask for a refund since I won't be using their service. If that is not possible and I do end up paying for the service - then I have to find an alternative way to finish their task, I would then ask someone to help me or I would try to do it myself. </p>
<p>The other risk is that I make music and I release it and I am not able to re-coup the money I invested in the project. This is the true risk of any artistic project, the bright side of this is that I spent months learning and building relationships and it will 100% pay in the long term in terms in terms of my growth not only as an artist but also as an individual. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot contribute financially, you can still help!</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, the number one way of helping me is by listening to my music - I am on Spotify + Youtube + Apple Music, you name it.. so even if you cannot add $ to my dreams, you can add some &lt;3 to them!</li>
<li>Please share this campaign and my music with your friends + family!</li>
<li>Indiegogo has brilliant share tools, just hit share and post this campaign on your social media.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you, thank you, thank you! </p>

<h3>Just another radio station? Definitely NOT!</h3>
<p>Local radio in the UK has changed over the past 10 years.  After a series of mergers, acquisitions and takeovers it seems the idea of a local radio station all the family can enjoy are gone - and that's why we are here!</p>
<p>Broadcasting 24 hours a day and available on your phone, tablet, laptop or desktop - and with a very familiar name - Trent Sound is set to launch on Monday 04 March 2019 as a truly localised station for Nottingham.  We are a not-for-profit social enterprise, with every penny re-invested in the service - but we need your help to get the project up and running!</p>
<p>Our exciting station will target the 40+ audience, harnessing the latest technologies to deliver a vibrant localised radio station with a mix of music, news, sport, weather, travel, community information - everything that Radio Trent offered but now re-invented for 2019.</p>
<p>You can listen to our test transmissions via the webrad.io website - just click <a href=""http://www.internetradiouk.com/#trent-sound"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What We Can Offer:</h3>
<p>We need to raise £6,500 to launch the station.  Much of the preparatory work has already been done. We have trademarked the name, test transmissions are underway via our <a href=""http://www.trentsound.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a>, the studio is built and some presenters have been found.  If we can't raise all of the money in this crowd funding bid, we plan to run again minus whatever we have raised.  Provided the vital licence fees can be covered we are guaranteed to launch on time even if it has to be a limited service.</p>
<p>The funding we seek will allow us to operate for two years, by which time we will have won an audience and be able to sell advertising to fund our future plans to broadcast as a DAB station. </p>
<p>In return for your support we have put together some reward packages which we think will be of interest and ensure that Trent Sound really rocks!  Parts of our reward scheme includes advertising on our website as banner ads, programme feature sponsorship and conventional radio advertisements - so for the first year in order to honour these commitments we will not actively try to sell more.</p>
<p>We have produced a multi-page document which details the entire ILR project in some detail, if you want to read it you'll be able to download a *.pdf version <a href=""http://www.trentsound.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/The-ILR-Project.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help:</h3>
<p>If you want to support Trent Sound but can't afford to help financially, we would certainly love to hear from you.  If you'd like more information you can email <a href=""mailto:info@trentsound.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">info@trentsound.net</a>, contact us via our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/trentsound"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> page or call us on 0330 043 5705 (Monday-Friday 09:00-17:00).</p>
