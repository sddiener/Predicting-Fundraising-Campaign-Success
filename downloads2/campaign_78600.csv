<h3>Memories of Places Past</h3>
<p>We are Trio dell’Aria. Comprised of Kripa Nageshwar (soprano), Michael Westwood (clarinetist) and<strong> </strong>Ruta Vaivade (pianist), our individual love and passion for chamber music drew us together, culminating in our first performance together at Toronto’s Westwood Concert Series in 2014. Since then, we have embarked on exploring music from Baroque to Contemporary and jazz to folksong and <i>chanson</i> throughout Ontario and Quebec, bringing us to new artistic levels of programming and performance.</p>
<p>All Canadian, but with diverse cultural backgrounds - British, Latvian, and Indian - we perform a wide array of eclectic music from Classical to Jazz and from the Baroque to the present day.</p>
<p>We aim to create an album which touches our listeners in a profound way and evokes in them the kind of emotions that it does for us. We are so grateful for the funding we have already received from the FACTOR foundation and we are just a short distance away from our ultimate financial goal for this album.</p>
<p>You have the opportunity to help us succeed immeasurably. With your assistance, we will be able to polish this recording and release the best possible product which would otherwise be impossible. We have a team in place with a fantastic producer, recording engineer, studio, and are set to release on the Really Records label. Just a little more financial support from you will literally make a massive difference to us.</p>
<p>We are hoping to raise $5000 from this campaign to get us to our goal so that we can confidently start recording in July this summer. To spark some motivation to help us with this, we have some exciting rewards ranging from limited edition discs, to signed copies, to digital downloads, to private performances and more!</p>
<p>Even if you can't financially contribute, you can still be of tremendous help by spreading the word about our project and sharing this campaign for us far and wide to further help us drum up support. Please use the Indiegogo share tool!</p>
<p>Although five thousand dollars is our goal, in the event that we raise funds beyond our target, we will use the additional amount towards our second CD project!</p>
<p>We are so close to our goal that we are confident you will help us close the gap and get all the way there. We are so fortunate to be able to do what we love and we humbly ask you to be a part of it with us.</p>

<p>Switch Affect is a duo that is currently based out of Tucson, AZ.</p>
<p>Having just released our debut album ‘The Absence Of’ our goal is to share and spread our art with as many of you as possible.</p>
<p>What we have created together has been a literal dream come true requiring an immense amount of work as well as too many personal struggles and obstacles to tell without writing a book… But we have finally done it! …and could not be more happy or proud of what we have accomplished.  And now we are ready to hit the road and perform the music that is in our hearts and souls, and that we were meant to create. </p>
<p>Both of us, Julianna and Jacob, have been professional musicians for several years, performing nationally as both solo artists and with various bands. Having shared the stage, while involved with other projects, we decided to do some collaboration on the side for the “fun of it” and see what would happen. Our first musical meeting was all that it took. That was it! As Jacob put it “I could die musically happy with just this first song.”  And with every following song that we recorded together, the sound kept evolving into something that neither of us had planned for or could have even imagined.  While working on our album we decided to work up a live set to see if the chemistry still remained outside of the studio. The response was instantly better than we could have hoped for, and as for the live chemistry… that was even better than our experience recording. It just fueled the flames even more when it came to writing and recording. Over the next several months this ended up becoming our primary passion and focus.  </p>
<p>Fortunately, as we were working with a zero budget, Jacob has spent most of his life as a session player and studio engineer working with many well known artists and learning from some of the top professionals in the industry. Both of us being multi-instrumentalists, wrote, recorded, and engineered our entire album on our own while trying to take advantage of any quiet space that was available at the time, sometimes even resorting to campgrounds in the desert or waiting until late night / early morning hours for the sounds of the city to die down, just to capture an acoustic guitar or vocal track.  We have worked hard to bring that same improvisation and resourcefulness into our live show as well, and this has been a fun and ever changing process that continues to challenge us creatively with rewarding results.  …but now is the time that we need your help and support as we endeavor to share our music and passion with you.</p>

The new structure changes everything; from the screws, bolts, and strapping that we'll use to our dimensions, types, and lengths of wood.</p><p><strong>We will recycle as many materials as possible from last year, but the 2017 design is significantly stronger and more intricate, which will require a larger budget.</strong> We'll also have additional major expenses in order to abide by Marin county fire codes; from purchasing specialized fire retardant to cover the entirety of all parachutes, to purchasing several fire extinguishers and a new outdoor/stage lighting system. We'll also be hiring a few professionals to help us keep everything as safe as possible: a structural engineer, an electrician, and a few assistant carpenters to help Gabe complete the initial build. We also have to purchase event insurance which can be $500-$2,000 per event. Your donation will allow us to build the safest and most beautiful space we can, and anything extra will allow us to be that much more creative and secure. </p><h2>Parachute Days Vision</h2><p>The Parachute Days team believes that (now more than ever) <strong>we need alternative gathering spaces where people of all ages can share art and collaborate;</strong> we believe this has the power to strengthen our communities. Love Field is in a unique position of being able to provide an open, safe, contained, and beautiful space for people of all ages and backgrounds to gather for this very reason. </p><p>Working together with<strong> local non-profits HomeBase</strong> and<strong> KWMR - West Marin Community Radio</strong>, Parachute Days is currently developing a long-term vision to host <strong>monthly music concerts</strong>, and <strong>monthly community-based events</strong> such as family movie nights and educational workshops with a focus on intergenerational collaboration. </p><p>The venue will be open and active from <strong>June to October in 2017,</strong> and ideally it will be built with the means to disassemble and reassemble easily for the following 2018 event season. Parachute Days, working in conjunction with local event production companies, musicians, and local non-profits, has developed a rough draft for the 2017 event season.</p><p>Below is the first birds-eye sketch of the <strong>2017 Parachute Days structure</strong>.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487383125/mrhvat8sgptl7nn6izaa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The main space is designed to be under a 100' wide parachute, which is significantly larger than last year's 64' wide parachute. <strong>The planning for the stage, backdrop, and all supporting pyramids and structures has increased in size and stability.</strong> A new dining and vendor area under three 30' multi-colored parachutes will also be added.</p><p>All parachutes and supporting structures will be secured with sailing quality lines and heavy duty auger ground anchors that exceed a break strength and can hold beyond 7,000 lbs. (The maximum pull strength of a 100' wide parachute is 4,000 lbs.) The sound booth will house timber framing telephone poles to hold the central parachute high in the center. We also are in consultation with structural engineers to assist in finalizing these plans. <strong>However, we do need your help to make this dream a reality.</strong> </p><h2>Ways You Can Help</h2><p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Forward by e-mail </strong>to anyone you know who might appreciate and support this project or share on social media.

Not only do we need to purchase a rare 100' surplus parachute, but we also need to build larger structures in accordance with our structural engineer. The new structure changes everything; from the screws, bolts, and strapping that we'll use to our dimensions, types, and lengths of wood.We will recycle as many materials as possible from last year, but the 2017 design is significantly stronger and more intricate, which will require a larger budget. We'll also have additional major expenses in order to abide by Marin county fire codes; from purchasing specialized fire retardant to cover the entirety of all parachutes, to purchasing several fire extinguishers and a new outdoor/stage lighting system. We'll also be hiring a few professionals to help us keep everything as safe as possible: a structural engineer, an electrician, and a few assistant carpenters to help Gabe complete the initial build. We also have to purchase event insurance which can be $500-$2,000 per event. Your donation will allow us to build the safest and most beautiful space we can, and anything extra will allow us to be that much more creative and secure. Parachute Days VisionThe Parachute Days team believes that (now more than ever) we need alternative gathering spaces where people of all ages can share art and collaborate; we believe this has the power to strengthen our communities. Love Field is in a unique position of being able to provide an open, safe, contained, and beautiful space for people of all ages and backgrounds to gather for this very reason. Working together with local non-profits HomeBase and KWMR - West Marin Community Radio, Parachute Days is currently developing a long-term vision to host monthly music concerts, and monthly community-based events such as family movie nights and educational workshops with a focus on intergenerational collaboration. The venue will be open and active from June to October in 2017, and ideally it will be built with the means to disassemble and reassemble easily for the following 2018 event season. Parachute Days, working in conjunction with local event production companies, musicians, and local non-profits, has developed a rough draft for the 2017 event season.Below is the first birds-eye sketch of the 2017 Parachute Days structure.The main space is designed to be under a 100' wide parachute, which is significantly larger than last year's 64' wide parachute. The planning for the stage, backdrop, and all supporting pyramids and structures has increased in size and stability. A new dining and vendor area under three 30' multi-colored parachutes will also be added.All parachutes and supporting structures will be secured with sailing quality lines and heavy duty auger ground anchors that exceed a break strength and can hold beyond 7,000 lbs. (The maximum pull strength of a 100' wide parachute is 4,000 lbs.) The sound booth will house timber framing telephone poles to hold the central parachute high in the center. We also are in consultation with structural engineers to assist in finalizing these plans. However, we do need your help to make this dream a reality. Ways You Can Help1. Forward by e-mail to anyone you know who might appreciate and support this project or share on social media.

<h3>Who the heck are you Morf? </h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Morf. Good question.</p>
<p>I'm a percussive lap guitarist and singer who travels around the world doing street shows for people rain or shine. Long story short, after years of doing this I've become well known by people and after going viral I have been asked by most of you ""how do I get your new cd?""</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Well! Another good question </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Being a street performer my funds are tight. And I want to deliver this CD to you; I had it mostly done via my home/on the road studio, but given the recent mass of interest in what I do after going viral and being on ABC News, I want that album to sound better than it does.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, high quality sound costs money. And playing on the street to make people smile isn't the most lucrative job; see the problem? D'oh!</p>
<p>So I need your help to raise some funds to make this album sound as good as it can be; I worked hard on the songs, I play day in day out on the streets, and you guys have been hammering me with ""how do I get the CD????"" so lets do this!!</p>
<p><strong>What do you get?</strong></p>
<p>What you get totally depends on the pledge; after questioning you guys on my Facebook page, I've put together some pledges and rewards; CD's, mp3s. even personal shows/ songs and my first guitar are up for grabs. So head to the pledge section and grab yourself whatever you fancy!</p>
<p>Non pledge donations also help; so stick one down if you've seen my show sometime and didnt have any cash to chuck at me :)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your help will allow me to put this album together and post it out to whoever wants to, worldwide.</p>
<p>I am unmanaged, and refuse to 'sell out' because what I do makes people happy; and isn't reliant on money. </p>
<p>The music industry nowadays is totally reliant on money; I have been requested on Britains got Talent, X factor, and the Voice in the past 2 years, and refused them all.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because if I went on them, and won, then I wouldn't be able to deliver you this album.</p>
<p>This album is a story of my life; and contains things we can all relate to, but they're not ""money"" ""girls"" ""in the club"" that dominates the music industry now.</p>
<p>They're fear, happiness about silly things, childhood, stories, and things that happen to us all; not just to the millionaire rappers and pop artists.</p>
<p>But in all that; refusing the industry, I act alone. And this is hard. </p>
<p>To get this album to the entire world is no easy task for one man, so your financial backing will allow me to do this.</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Artists, designers, digital designers, web savvy people, people with loads of followers, anyone can help. </p>
<p>if you can add to the project; CD cover, website campaign, etc etc, thats fantastic! Email me!</p>
<p>Even sharing the campaign will help. The more people that know about it; the higher chance those who are waiting to find out about how to get my new album, can find out about it. I can't reach everyone alone :)</p>

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>My name is Owen. 29. New Brunswick based, PEI raised .....</p>
<p>Forays into songwriting, sound, and other tributaries of art have long been a part of my life and - to cut to the chase - this campaign has been set up to help myself and a group of pals (<i>Motherhood  aka Penny, Brydon &amp; Adam)</i>  continue on that path in the form of a musical collaboration &amp; recording session.</p>
<p>The design of this platform is elementary: Supporters select a 'perk' that interests them, pay for it online now, and agree to receive it at a later date. In turn, the funds raised help ensure that the project is completed.</p>
<p>Personally, this project means a lot! Considering it has been entertained for so long and is now actually happening is equal parts a feeling of excitement and relief. The trade off between myself and the band is an exchange of creative ideas, energy, respect, and so much more! Collaboration is health food for the arts. Additionally, by accessing the <i>Memramcook Recording Company</i>, we will directly be supporting a new business right here in the province of NB.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>So. We are looking to raise $5,500 for costs associated with the project. This includes:</p>
<p><i>Studio: </i>$350 / per day x 3 (2 recording, 1 mixing) = $1050   </p>
<p><i>Van Transportation: </i>$75 / each way (St. Andrews - Fredericton - Memramcook ) = $150</p>
<p><i>Mastering: </i>$100 / per song x 4 = $400 </p>
<p><i>50, 7"" lathe cut vinyl: </i>$450 + shipping = $500</p>
<p><i>Band Fee: $</i>125/ea per day x 4 people (2 days in studio + 2 days pre-prod) = $2,000</p>
<p><i>Co-producer fee</i>: $500 / per day x 2 = $1000</p>
<p><i>Comic book costs (printing, postage, etc)</i>: $400</p>
<p><strong>What I am initially offering in exchange for your pledge is a small assortment of goodies to choose from, including:</strong> </p>
<p>- Song downloads </p>
<p>- An original comic book  <strong>OR</strong></p>
<p>- A <i>very</i> limited edition comic / lathe cut vinyl / download combo package ..</p>
<p><strong>* About the comic *</strong></p>
<p>'<i> MCHL JCKSN LIVES IN ST. ANDY (and takes Refrigeration at the Community College) Vol.1</i> ' is a short comic book series that entertains the possibility one of America's great pop icons - thought dead - is actually living a disguised life in small town New Brunswick, Canada. Through a mix of basic illustration, block lettering, and cut 'n paste collage, M.J.L.I.S.A attempts to hold a mirror up to the town, showing off its seedy backside and reminding the reader that things are not often as they seem upon closer inspection - for better or worse! Simultaneously (and absurdly enough) it also gives a brief history lesson on the ultimate 'generator of cool' : THE REFRIGERATOR! </p>
<p>Volume 1 sets the tone and introduces several characters ending with a '<i>to be continued</i>..' The rest of the publication is given over to a selection of strange photographs, recipes, poems, and much more!</p>
<p><strong>* ALSO... PLEASE NOTE *</strong></p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with lathe cut vinyl, it is <i>not</i> the same as a regular vinyl record. The quality is still quite good but there are several important factors to be aware of (it will playback in mono, for example). You can learn more by doing a very quick internet search. This limited release is intended for your listening enjoyment, yet also serves as a novelty and collectors item!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By choosing to fund this project you are helping us to advance our craft and are directly supporting The Arts in New Brunswick.</p>
<p>""In a province fraught with an array of social woes, our own music not only represents our ailments, but attempts to recreate them into meaningful totems of Eastern living. While New Brunswick struggles with employment, debt, and its own conception of itself,  music from these artists represents the difficulties of growing and searching for meaning. Amidst the backdrop of an underdog province, Motherhood and Owen are creating music that embodies both a sense of loss which this province grapples with <i>and</i> offers meaning in a time enmeshed in meaninglessness. If New Brunswick is a geography that produces underdog mentalities and occasional defeatism, then these songs will offer substance and growth. And, if their own angst over aging creates aimlessness, then may their music seek to reinstill a sense of place within the maelstrom of maturity. Even after either 150 or 29 years, these artists and their province are coming of age. Within that narrative, their aim is to not offer concrete direction, but meaning to the dire straits of growing up an underdog."" </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There is a good chance the total goal <i>won't</i> be reached! That is not necessarily being pessimistic .. Just realistic. 5k is a lot of money and I certainly don't expect anything from anyone! Nonetheless, based on successful campaigns I've run in the past, I am hopeful. Should the desired funds not be raised upon the campaign's completion, it may result in a slight delay in mail outs - but that is all! For the record, I want to state that the project will be carried out regardless of how much is accumulated. I work a good paying job and am prepared to finance this out of my own pocket if need be. In fact, I have already put a down payment on the studio fee. Weather, health, and other unforeseen challenges come with the territory ... Whatever the case, we'll make it happen!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>No money? No problem!</h3>
<p>If you can't make a donation but are still interested in helping, than by all means spread the word! Feel free to share this page with your friends, family, and complete strangers over the various forms of social media available (including the Indiegogo share tool). Telephone, hand written letters, word of mouth, message in a bottle, &amp; thought shapes work too!</p>

What we want:
Your contributions will help us pay the fee($2,000) required by U.S. Public Performance Organizations (PROs) who collect publishing royalties for the creators of the music we play.

Hello everyone! My name is Yukika.
 I will release a new album. ""WELCOME TO JAPAN""
It's a song where I introduce Japan and Japanese.
And I'm going to America with it in August.
I want to be the worlds most famous singer one day!
I would like to introduce Japanese culture to the world!
I'll take the first big step towards my dream.
 
I wrote something in Japanese because my English is poor. 
こんにちは！恭加(ゆきか)です。
関西で大阪中心に活動しているいわゆるシンガーソングライターですが、
1人でバンドをやってます。
 
作詞作曲はもちろん編曲、演奏、ライブ演出、MV制作....
全て、セルフプロデュース!!!!!しています。
 
野生のシカやらくまやら、そんな自然なところで
自由に発想しながらみんなと一瞬一瞬遊びきれるような
そんなライブパフォーマンスを作っています。
 
 
▼このプロジェクトで実現したいこと
●海外も視野に入れた新しいアルバムを制作すること!!
制作費用を集めて最高傑作のアルバムにしたいです。
だから、渡米前、大阪でワンマンライブを開きそこで発売して、
このプロジェクトに参加してくださった方々に
その価値があった！と絶対に思ってもらえるような作品を作りたいです。
 
●それをひっさげて、前代未聞の完全セルフプロデュースシンガーソングライターが
アメリカ・ロサンゼルスで路上ライブツアーを決行するということ!!
恭加は今までもすべてセルフプロデュースでやってきていますが
アメリカツアーまでも一人でやってのけるという前代未聞で、まだ行ったことない海外なんて未知数やけど、
私の夢や憧れでもある土地にアルバムをもってライブしてって自分の力を試したいし、
どうしてもやってみたいこと、それを通していまだ未知の経験やスキルを習得したい！
 
●ミュージックビデオ制作！！
前回のMVも完全自主制作でした。（Dancing Night）
今回も現時点で制作中ですが、やっぱり動画というのは全世界へ配信できるものだから、
今回のプロジェクトで資金がたくさん集まることができたら、
自主制作の期待を超えた自主制作でめちゃくちゃクオリティをあげて
このミュージックビデオも最高のものに仕上げたいです！
 
 
▼プロジェクトをやろうと思った理由
私が音楽をやっているいじょう、絶対にゆるがない目標があって、
大きな目標としてぶっちゃけたら「世界で活躍する日本のアーティスト代表になりたい」です。
でもそんな大きすぎる漠然的目標じゃ笑われるだけで、
自分にすら漠然としすぎてイメージも漠然やし、進んでみないとわからないこともたくさんあります。
だからもちろん、大きな目標の前に小さな目標がいくつもいくつもあります。
そのひとつとして、今夏 叶えたいことが、
１. 海外も視野に入れたCD制作
２. アメリカ路上ライブツアー
３. 渡米前レコ発20th birthdayワンマンライブ
です。

<p>Hello! My name is Adina Nyree. I am a singer/songwriter and independent recording artist. My debut album <strong><i>Certified Organic</i> </strong>was released in 2009 and continues to be well-received by a global audience. But, it's time for new music. My sophomore album, <i><strong>Stone, Flesh &amp; Love</strong></i> is ready to be birthed. And, I need your help!</p>
<p>I don't know how to make any thing but REAL music, with REAL musicians and singers for REAL people like YOU.  Those of you who already follow me on social media know that for many years I have advocated for true music lovers to BUY the music of artists that you like so that we can make more music for you. Often times, music fans don’t really know what it cost artists to make an album and are unaware of how very little artists make from streaming platforms. I believe in transparency and education. I believe in YOU and your support of me as an artist! Pre-orders of Stone, Flesh &amp; Love will help to offset the costs of creating a project worthy of your ears. </p>
<p>The ALBUM ARTWORK: I think album artwork is still really important. Being a hugefan of noir comic illustration, I asked one of my super talented friends to bring what I have in my head for the Stone, Flesh and Love cover and liner note areas to life... </p>
<p>Otis Arterberry also known as “Blaqlion3” is an outstanding visual artist...  </p>

His work includes several book covers for published authors, as well as creating logos and media images for various clients. BlaqLion also enjoys giving back to the community. He volunteers his talents and time for various after school programs and youth centers, teaching children about art, sculpting with clay and most importantly, creating from the heart.

<p>At the beginning level of support, you'll receive an autographed poster and a copy of <i>Stone, Flesh &amp; Love.  </i>Additional perk levels include rewards of t-shirts, tote bags, album release party tickets, private concerts and more!</p>

<p>The Concert was recorded live on August 13, 2017 at The Iridium in New York City, 1650 Broadway in the heart of Times Square. Many of you reading this were actually there at the Live Concert Recording! Now, I've heard the unmixed version, <i>which by the way sounds amazing,</i> and I promise you...<strong><i>Your cheers and applause will be represented loud and clear on this album! </i></strong></p>
<p>This Live Concert Recording celebrates the<strong> Three Time Academy Award-Winning </strong>Husband and Wife songwriting team,<strong> Alan &amp; Marilyn Bergman.</strong> Who by the way are celebrating 60 years of marriage together this year! Isn't that amazing!!?? So, I think they might have a thing or two to say about life and love.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>Celebrating them and their songs is a dream come true for me!</strong></i></p>
<p>I personally have been drawn to their songs for so many years. And, I just love interpreting their beautiful, amazing, poignant, heartfelt and deep lyrics. I mean every time I sing one of their songs, it's like I'm singing it for the first time...going on a brand new journey, Every - Single - Time! And, the collective beauty is that their songs offer that same powerful journey to the listener as well. <i><strong>That's why I feel so passionate about getting this album out there and into your hands!</strong> </i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The Album is a collection of 18 of their most beloved songs, such as:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Where Do You Start?</li>
<li>What Are You Doing The Rest of Your Life?</li>
<li>How Do You Keep The Music Playing?</li>
<li>Nice 'N' Easy</li>
<li>The Way We Were</li>
<li>The Windmills of Your Mind</li>
<li>On My Way To You</li>
<li>Between Yesterday and Tomorrow...<i><strong>and 10 More!</strong></i><i><strong>​</strong></i>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By you contributing to this project...You will be helping make a Dream Come True for me! Singing and expressing myself through song is my true passion and the reason I feel I was put on this earth. I love to give emotionally to my audience and receive all that love back! There truly isn't anything like the energy of a live performance and that amazing energy was caught on this recording...You can just feel it, even if you weren't there live.</p>

 BLUJAZZ LABEL SLATED TO RELEASE ALBUM!!!
Critically Acclaimed Vocalist Needs Your Help!
Hi Everyone! I'm Marieann Meringolo...
Pronounced MARIE-ANN  MA-RING-GO-LOW. Now, I promise you with practice it will get easier! 
I'm a NYC based vocalist/recording artist (click here to learn more about Marieann Meringolo http://marieannmeringolo.com) and I'm very excited to introduce you to my newest CD project that I'm hoping moves you as much as it has moved me recording it:
""Between Yesterday and Tomorrow: The Songs of Alan & Marilyn Bergman."" 
I recorded this album live with my incredible team...my Musical Director and Arranger on Piano, Doyle Newmyer. Doyle and I have worked together for over the last 17 years and he is the genius behind all of my arrangements. Also featured are my bass player, Boots Maleson and drummer Sipho Kunene...I call them My Fabulous Trio, all neatly packaged together by my brilliant Director, Will Nunziata. 
And, now I'm currently in the process of mixing and mastering with my engineer, the accomplished and very talented Lance McVickar!
*And, now for the Breaking News... 
As I was putting this campaign together I learned that the Album is now slated to be Released on an actual Label... Blujazz Label and Promotions! This is such exciting news! So, this means...CD Distribution, Promotion to NPR/Public Radio Stations, Mainstream Jazz and College Radio. Potential articles and press in major jazz publications, future booking and touring in the US and Europe! https://www.blujazz.com/

 
Read Rave Review of the Concert Recording:
  https://nitelifeexchange.com/the-magical-mellifluous-marieann-meringolo-records-in-our-presence-cant-wait-for-the-cd/
The Concert was recorded live on August 13, 2017 at The Iridium in New York City, 1650 Broadway in the heart of Times Square. Many of you reading this were actually there at the Live Concert Recording! Now, I've heard the unmixed version, which by the way sounds amazing, and I promise you...Your cheers and applause will be represented loud and clear on this album! 
This Live Concert Recording celebrates the Three Time Academy Award-Winning Husband and Wife songwriting team, Alan & Marilyn Bergman. Who by the way are celebrating 60 years of marriage together this year! Isn't that amazing!!?? So, I think they might have a thing or two to say about life and love.
Celebrating them and their songs is a dream come true for me!
I personally have been drawn to their songs for so many years. And, I just love interpreting their beautiful, amazing, poignant, heartfelt and deep lyrics. I mean every time I sing one of their songs, it's like I'm singing it for the first time...going on a brand new journey, Every - Single - Time! And, the collective beauty is that their songs offer that same powerful journey to the listener as well. That's why I feel so passionate about getting this album out there and into your hands! 
The Album is a collection of 18 of their most beloved songs, such as:

Where Do You Start?
What Are You Doing The Rest of Your Life?
How Do You Keep The Music Playing?
Nice 'N' Easy
The Way We Were
The Windmills of Your Mind
On My Way To You
Between Yesterday and Tomorrow...and 10 More!​


By you contributing to this project...You will be helping make a Dream Come True for me! Singing and expressing myself through song is my true passion and the reason I feel I was put on this earth. I love to give emotionally to my audience and receive all that love back! There truly isn't anything like the energy of a live performance and that amazing energy was caught on this recording...You can just feel it, even if you weren't there live.
And, now You as the contributor can make this CD a reality!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>EP 'Know by Heart' cross-hairs two of Vancouver's emerging independent musicians, Samuel Romero and Thomas Beckman. Over the past 5-8 years both artists have made profound ripples within their local communities, and now the resonance and relevance to come from this long awaited collaboration is finally at hand. </p>
<p><strong>The musicians:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Samuel Romero</strong> is an Expressive Arts Therapist, Singer/Songwriter and Guitarist who wishes to inspire self-awareness and expression through the arts. Believing that creativity has the power to heal he created the <strong><a href=""http://www.earthhearthum.com/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Earth Heart Hum Foundation</i></a></strong> to generate positive impact in the lives of others through musical works, Expressive Arts workshops and community events. Crafting music that is reflective and uplifting, Sam wishes to use this creative platform as a vehicle for transformation, healing and connection. </li>
<li>
<strong>Thomas Beckman</strong>, as creative director of <strong><a href=""http://www.sonsofgranville.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Sons of Granville</i></a></strong> engages in numerous projects as an orchestral violist, composer, arranger and producer. His aim is to seek out new niche's that can bring relevance and inspiration to the community around him, as with his many entrepreneurial projects including his collaboration with the<i>Vancouver Maritime Museum </i>, the <i>BC Canadian Music Centre</i>, the <i>Borealis Quartet</i>, the <i>MacMillan Space Centre </i>and the <i>Vancouver Pops Symphony Orchestra</i> to name a few.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The purpose:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Serious musical growth and community engagement requires a space in which to create and converge compelling musical ideas. When differing styles are thrown together like atoms in a particle accelerator, break-throughs in song writing, modes of performance and lyrical expression can best be achieved. And when community is at the heart of artistic collaboration, the effects can both be positive and far reaching. </li>
<li><i>As our commitment to community we pledge to donate <strong>20%</strong> of every digital and physical EP sale to the Downtown Eastside Neighbourhood House in an effort to support the movement against poverty. </i></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>To produce our EP we require Tyler Neil Johnson's producer's fee of $3500. This all important portion covers almost every aspect of music production, from studio recording, to editing, and mixing. As well as, an additional $500 for the final masters.</li>
<li>To design and replicate 500 CD's with Art &amp; Lyrics booklet we require a further $1000. </li>
<li>
<i><strong>Your investment comes with great returns. Our list of perks contains numerous options and we're confident you'll find something right for you. </strong></i><br/><br/>In the unlikely event our target is not met, both Sam and I are prepared to invest the deficit amount to get this inspired new work fully produced and in place to make a positive impact. Whatever we make, and whatever you contribute will go a long way towards getting us there!  </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact &amp; Paying-it-forward</h3>
<p>Artist's records typically serve as career-boosting, valid contributions to the ever growing surplus of music in the world. Our aim however, is to take this a step further by tying our work to the community.  </p>
<ul>
<li>We believe art and community are deeply connected, and the more we develop this relationship, the more we stand to build and foster empathy and compassion in our world. </li>
<li>In 2016, over $1000 was raised for the Bowen Public Library as well as the Namo Buddha Foundation via this same concept, with Thomas' EP 'Music for Bowen' and single 'Nepal Prayer.' This time we strive to hit vastly higher figures with the sale of our EP at numerous concerts, public performances, and various community-driven outlets. </li>
<li>Sam's Community Fundraiser in 2015 and 2016 combined with Two City grants raised over $1500 to put towards two free community art projects - <i>Community Mandala Days</i> as well as, establishing the Earth Heart Hum Foundation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><i>As an additional sign of our commitment, upon the completion of the 'Know By Heart' EP we'll prepare 100 meals for the Downtown Eastside Neighbourhood House followed by a public performance for the Eastside community.</i></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>​<strong>OM OATS</strong>! With this project Sam aims to marry a passion for food and service by crafting his special recipe of super nutritious oatmeal, he affectionately calls Om Oats.</li>
<li>The population in the DTES lack proper nutrition and we aim to directly make a difference by offering fresh fruits, nutritious and wholesome ingredients in the meals funded by this project.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Producing music independently can be a difficult journey. Without the proper financial support it makes focusing on the songwriting and rehearsal process a lot more stressful and uncertain. Just as the community benefits from the enrichment by its local arts, so does the artistic community depend on the support from its patrons. </p>
<ul>
<li>Sam and Thomas have committed themselves to a career in music, and to their collaboration long before financial solutions were in range. Our dedication to the craft of making music has overcome many past barriers and we will continue to forge ahead no matter what. </li>
<li>Our strategy to ensuring the 'Know by Heart' EP is made, lies within the strength of convergence. By combining our followers we double our audience and patron size, and therefore our community of supporters, family and friends. By doing so we increase our chances for success. As soloists we have succeeded with past indiegogo campaigns. Assuredly, with strengths combined, we'll succeed together. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>If purchasing a perk is a non-possibility, there are many other ways you can help. Apart from sharing and providing online feedback to our campaign, you can help expand our social efforts by connecting us with proactive leaders and music lovers. Campaigns thrive on ideas and collaboration. The more thinkers and enthusiasts you can help link us to, the more successful we'll be. </li>
<li>At the very least, we ask that you use the indiegogo link to share with your family and friends. </li>

<h3>Introducing the EP...</h3>
<p>I'm thrilled to feature some of the best talent in Seattle in my West Coast EP. This project started when I met Anthony Lee Phillips here in Seattle, and was blown away by his album ""Between Doubles"". We began collaborating almost immediately upon meeting. I began working with him on his new Blur EP, to be released 12/13 and thus met his trumpet player Andrew Forbes and bass player Theodore Lim. Next came Marco Falzone on drums, and the rest is history! This EP features really fun tunes of mine, re-energized and enhanced by this tight, passionate crew.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Before I moved to the West Coast, I'd started my own collection of CDs primarily featuring local artists. There is something so special about digging into the community around me and hearing the voices I may not otherwise. I'm endlessly inspired by the musicians right under my nose. I'm hoping those around me are just as excited, enthusiastic, and passionate as I am about local talent and might consider adding me to their mix.</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><i>Ask me about the undiscovered talent, I'll gladly gush!</i></p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hello! I'm Alice Price, a singer-songwriter from Bristol, UK and I'm releasing my debut EP of five original songs.</p>
<p>This is the first time in my musical career I've ever released my own music and I'm so excited!! It's a been a long time coming.</p>
<p>A few years ago I became ill and developed vocal nodules which stopped me from being able to sing (and sometimes talk) properly. However, I continued to spend many hours crafting and refining every element of the melodies, structures, instrumentation, and the lyrics of my songs to what I believe is perfection. A lot of hard work has gone into preparing this project and I’ve done everything I possibly can to get the music, artwork, photography, marketing, etc to where it is - I just need financial help to get it over the finish line! And now, after years of hospital therapy, my vocals are finally back on the mend and I now feel I'm ready to release my music into the world.</p>
<p>By donating, you will be helping an artist at the beginning of their career and ultimately help me with the first step towards achieving my dreams. In return, I’ll give you music that I hope you’ll love and will resonate with you for many years to come!</p>

</div></div>","My Story
Hello! I'm Alice Price, a singer-songwriter from Bristol, UK and I'm releasing my debut EP of five original songs.
This is the first time in my musical career I've ever released my own music and I'm so excited!! It's a been a long time coming.
A few years ago I became ill and developed vocal nodules which stopped me from being able to sing (and sometimes talk) properly. However, I continued to spend many hours crafting and refining every element of the melodies, structures, instrumentation, and the lyrics of my songs to what I believe is perfection. A lot of hard work has gone into preparing this project and I’ve done everything I possibly can to get the music, artwork, photography, marketing, etc to where it is - I just need financial help to get it over the finish line! And now, after years of hospital therapy, my vocals are finally back on the mend and I now feel I'm ready to release my music into the world.
By donating, you will be helping an artist at the beginning of their career and ultimately help me with the first step towards achieving my dreams. In return, I’ll give you music that I hope you’ll love and will resonate with you for many years to come!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>KHARA is a post rock band consisted of Emil Pachkovski, Milan Trajkovikj, Filip Stojkovski and Filip Mihajlovski.<br/>Inspired by bands such as Mogwai, Explosions In The Sky, Sigur Ros and many more we gathered and formed the band in October of 2014.<br/>So far we have played more than 40 shows around the Balkans and Europe and shared the stage with bands like:<br/>Thievery Corporation (US)<br/>Tides From Nebula (Poland)<br/>Rosetta (US)<br/>North (US)<br/>Kayo Dot (US)<br/>Disciplin a Kitschme (RS)<br/>and many more.<br/><br/>We have always tried self-financing all of our stuff, but this time we want to bring out a next-level album and that is why we need help.<br/>All of the funds raised will be channeled towards the process of making this album possible. Keep in mind this is not for individual profit, strictly to help us achieve our goal.<br/>For that reason we have decided to put the option of pre-ordering ''Heaven Can Wait'' as a part of our prizes.<br/>It will be immensely helpful to reach our projected goal as it will make everything that we plan to do possible. KHARA will be extremely thankful to all like-minded people who enjoy our music and to everyone who will discover it in the future. It means a lot not just to help financially, but sharing the news as much as possible via any kind of social media.<br/>We firmly believe that together we will help ''Heaven Can Wait'' see the light of the day.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our projected goal is 1500 USD.<br/>We will try to finance a small amount by ourselves, but that still leaves us with a lot of costs that need to be covered.<br/>More specifically the funds raised will be channeled to the following:<br/>- Recording, mixing and mastering - 500 USD<br/>- 500 copies of exclusive Digipak CD's - 500 USD<br/>- 40 digitally printed t-shirts - 200 USD<br/>- Cover art - 200 USD<br/>- Promo materials (posters, stickers, social media promotion) - 100 USD</li>
<li>One of the most unique perks that you will get is that with a donation of 10 USD or more you will automatically pre-order the exclusive Digipak CD copy of ''Heaven Can Wait'' + digital download.</li>
<li>The projected release date is September of 2018. That will leave us with enough time to properly finish everything. We will need a couple of months to finish the recording process and then some time to print the CD's and ship them out to all of the pledgers.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>As we previously said we believe that the album will be ''genre-defying'' and provoke feelings that you don't experience every day. KHARA will work very hard to deliver to you an album that will be special to every single one of you in a different way.<br/>That is our goal.</li>
<li>Previously, we have tried to do a campaign on Indiegogo that didn't reach the goal.<br/>But that didn't discourage us. Instead we worked even harder, played a lot of shows and somehow managed to record it. Since then we have been on a tour, been part of mixtapes and released a soundtrack for a documentary movie.</li>

Viktor Krauss is an American musician who plays acoustic and electric bass. He has released solo albums and has worked as a sideman with many musicians, including his sister, singer and fiddler Alison Krauss. Since 1992, Krauss has been a presence in Nashville Tennessee with over 400 album credits as a bassist, guitarist, pianist, composer/songwriter or producer.  In 2006, Viktor was awarded a fellowship for the prestigious Film Composer’s Lab at the Sundance Institute and his film credits include three compositions in Ken Burns’ documentary ""Baseball: The Tenth Inning"", composing credits for the films, Robert Altman’s Dr. T. and the Women (co-composed with Lyle Lovett and Matt Rollings) and the independent film, ""Dodge City"". 

""If you love what you do, it's not work"".  If this is true, then Jim Hoke's out of work. He's very busy, however, being Nashville's premier ""go to"" guy on sax/woodwinds, harmonica, pedal steel, a plethora of other color instruments, plus horn and string arrangements for a virtual who's who of every musical category. Top artists in pop, country, Americana and other styles respect Jim for the amazing level of artistry he brings to everything he does. Nashville is a town of musical specialists and Jim is a rarity - a specialist on a baffling number of instruments, and he plays each one as if it's the only thing he does.

Gary Craig is a Toronto, Canada based drummer/percussionist who is currently touring Canada with Jann Arder. He has performed live and in the studio with many artists including Anne Murray, Bruce Cockburn, Colin Linden, Blackie and the Rodeo Kings, Tom Cochrane, Kathleen Edwards, The Rankin Family, Jenn Grant, Eddy Schwartz, John McDermott and Suzie Vinnick.

<h3>Why Should I Help You?</h3>
<p>My heart is in my home-state of Oklahoma. I believe in this red earth sure as I know the sun will rise tomorrow. I've recorded the record. Now I need to finish paying the folks who helped, and do a lot of filming. </p>
<p>The purpose of the album + film is to tell a story as no one has told one yet. Don't we all want to do that? But the heart of the story is Oklahoma. Oklahoma is the leading character and I want to show her off to the world.</p>
<p>This summer, with your help, I plan to go all around this great state I am lucky to call home and film her sunsets, her sunrises, her rivers, her mountains, her deserts and rivers and lakes and forests. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Imma Need to Give You Great Art</h3>
<p>I need to finish paying my producer &amp; to get it mastered. This is going to cost around $2600.</p>
<p>That leaves the rest I'm asking for. It's a hefty sum and I don't feel comfortable asking for it, but I know I have to. The rest of the money will go towards funding travel costs to the places of Oklahoma such as Black Mesa, Little Sahara, Natural Falls, Ouchitas, Talimena Scenic Byway, The list goes on. It will also help cover costs unforeseen in editing and additional camera supplies. </p>
<p>The other major cost will be album roll out. I have a really neat plan to do this but it all hinges on the amount of support I can get.</p>
<p>Depending on how much you give, theres different levels of involvement. We'll get to that. </p>
<h3>What's Gonna Happen If We Pull This Off?</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Oklahoma is gonna become the place. It already has become so. We are in the renaissance of our great state, but we have work to do and it starts with people such as myself seeing the beauty here and staying to help cultivate that beauty. There is so much to see, help me show the world what beauty lays within these panhandle lines.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>You Think You Can Pull This Off?</h3>
<p>Hopefully you're still reading. Yes I do. One reason is, I am choosing to shoot this project with an iPhone 8+ and an Anthropomorphic Lens that allows me to shoot in widescreen. This is a new way to shoot film, that can be seen on Netflix in films such as <i>Tangerine </i>which was shot using an iPhone 5s!</p>
<p>Though this is a massive undertaking, I know that with support from y'all, and from the friends I already got, we can change the face of Oklahoma, forever. </p>

<h3>About The Campaign</h3>
<p>All Bill wants for Christmas is to finish his new album. He just wrapped up the recording portion of the roots/country project, which will be released in 2019. He financed this first step of completing the album himself, but could use a little extra help covering the costs of mixing, mastering and manufacturing the album.</p>
<p>Keeping independent music alive is so important, and If you've been to one of Bill's gigs, you know that he's all about engaging the audience and making sure they have a great time!  In the spirit of Christmas, please consider making a contribution to help make Bill's holiday wish to fund his album come true.</p>
<p><strong><u>Plus</u></strong>, he's got some Christmas goodies in store for you if you help him reach his goal, including holiday e-cards, a copy of the album when it's released, and most festive of all, a digital copy of the holiday single ""Kiss Me Arse (And Go Away For Christmas) if you contribute by December 25! Everyone's family has their go-to Christmas classics to play during the holidays, but why not switch things up this year with a mildly cynical, yet endearing holiday jingle to entertain your favourite relatives?</p>
<p>Wondering what to expect from Bill's album? You can listen to some live versions of songs that will be included on it here:</p>

<p>Bill Simms is singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist whose music ranges stylistically between folk, roots and blues with lyrics that showcase his cheeky sense of humour and honest sincerity.</p>
<p>A proud Canadian and Newfoundlander, Bill’s lyrics include references to kilometers, toonies and the Bluenose. With a new album coming out in 2019, Bill is ready to unleash a whole slew of folk and roots songs sure to make audiences hoot, holler, belly laugh and maybe even shed a tear. Dealing with subjects such as longing, adultery, death and love, Bill's songs have something for everyone to relate to.</p>
<ul></ul>
<h3>The History of ""Kiss Me Arse (And Go Away For Christmas)""</h3>
<p>Twas the day before Christmas break and Bill was only 16 years old. He stood in front of a school assembly and played the new holiday song that he had just written, Kiss Me Arse (And Go Away For Christmas). With lyrics about wishing his relatives would leave him alone for the holidays, the students roared with applause while some members of the faculty were somewhat less enthused. </p>
<p>Regardless, the legacy of the single was born and this year Bill decided to get in the Christmas spirit by filming a music video for the track! </p>

African-American singer, percussionist and cultural historian Linda Tillery, described Kelly and her music with the following words:
“Kelly Takunda Orphan has been on a long and wondrous journey, beginning with her Armenian roots to the percussion driven music of Zimbabwe, West Africa and the Caribbean. Orphan’s music reveals a rare breed of musician who carefully fuses together the music from disparate cultures. Her vocals are warm and lush and the music will make you want to dance.”
Join us in being part of this international project and let’s celebrate the joy of Zimbabwe! Mafaro eZimbabwe!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am seeking funding to complete the album via pre-orders of the album!<br/> </p>
<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Bryan.  My oldest son (Cale, 11) is a 2E child with ADHD and Anxiety.  He takes stimulant medication to help him get through the day.  The downside of this medication is he has a hard time going to sleep -- even without the medication he has a hard time going to sleep.  To help him sleep at night I started playing the guitar quietly for him.  This worked okay.....</p>
<p>Then I started doing research and discovered how to use music to help him.  I believe the same approach can help other 2E, ADHD, and Anxious children fall asleep quicker at night.</p>
<p>That all said, I amrecording an album of 15 songs (approximately 74 minutes in length) laid out in a specific format with each track of the album serving a specific purpose.  The songs themselves are layered with scientifically proven tones (frequencies) and tempo to occupy the active mind of a child with ADHD while relaxing their physical body at the same time.   When played in the order these songs are laid out on the album it will help the child with ADHD fall asleep faster.</p>
<p>I have posted a sample song on SoundCloud:   <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/bryanwisda/cale-lullaby"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cale's Lullaby</a><br/>***Please note this is a sample incomplete song and still in the mixing and mastering process.  </p>
<p>While the songs are written and recorded for children with specific diagnoses (2E, ADD/ADHD, Anxiety), I have had grown adults tell me they fell sound asleep to these songs.  </p>
<p>The album is scheduled to be released on January 29, 2019.  The album will be released independently and available on all the streaming music services worldwide including Apple Music, Google Music, Spotify, and Amazon Music.  Physical CDs will be available for purchase as well through Amazon, Target, Best Buy, and major music retailers worldwide.<br/> </p>

</div><div>
<p>Releasing an album without the support of a major record label can be daunting task.  Fortunately today, music can be professionally recorded in a home studio.</p>
<p>Pre-orders of the album will raise capital for the following:</p>
<p>- Hiring a professional audio engineer to help mix and master the album<br/>- Mastering the album for release on both CD and Streaming Services<br/>- Capital to manufacture CDs for distribution</p>
<p>Additional capital raised via pre-orders will go toward:</p>
<p>- Capital to market the album once released<br/>- Purchasing air play on streaming services like Pandora &amp; Spotify<br/>- Secure regular print advertisements in <a href=""https://www.additudemag.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ADDitude Magazine</a><br/> </p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;'>What You Get</span></p>
<p>PRE-PURCHASE DISCOUNT<br/>By pre-ordering the album you get a 50% discount versus the retail price.  And because your pre-order is a crowdfunding contribution no sales taxes are charged on the pre-orders.</p>
<p>BECOME A CONTRIBUTOR<br/>You can also become a contributor and help provide valuable feedback during the recording, mixing, and mastering process.  As a contributor you'll receive a physical CD and 9 Digital Downloads when the album is released.  You'll also be mentioned with special thanks on the website and in the CD jacket notes.</p>
<p>NAME A SONG<br/>Want bragging rights?  You can purchase the right to name one of the songs on the album.  In addition to the perks of being a Contributor you can choose the final name for one of the songs on the album.  Obviously, the name will have to be tasteful and keeping with the theme of the album.  Additionally, I will send you a framed copy of the CD jacket and the CD itself for you to display.</p>
<p>I JUST WANT TO STREAM THE ALBUM WHEN RELEASED<br/>Today, many people have gone away from buying physical CDs and subscribe to a streaming music service.  In that case pre-ordering the album isn't for you.  Instead please consider making a small donation to help fund the album by clicking BACK IT above.</p>
<p>Whether you pre-purchase a download, a CD, become a contributor, or name a song, or just contribute $1 or $2 you'll know you're helping complete a valuable project.  Parents who have 2E, ADD/ADHD, Autistic, or Anxious children have a hard enough time; you will be helping millions of parents gain some sanity.<br/> </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If you have a 2E child, ADHD child, Anxious child, or Autistic child then you know how challenging getting that child to sleep at night can be.  It is exhausting and cuts into the husband/wife time at night.  I am confident this album will help many parents gain sanity and help their child get more needed sleep at night.</p>
<p>As a parent of a 2E child with ADHD &amp; Anxiety I am committed to helping other parents who a child like mine.   I am pledging 10% of the profit of all album sales to support organizations which conduct research in the fields of 2E and ADHD or provide resources for parents (like <a href=""http://www.understood.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Understood.org</a>).  <br/> </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

<h3>Be part of something that is WORLDWIDE!</h3>
<p>Do you want to be part of something that is WORLDWIDE? So you can say ""I had a hand in that!""</p>
<p>So do we!</p>
<p>We have written heartfelt lyrics and offer our fans an exciting show with a blend of Canadian country, rock and blues.</p>
<p>Our second album SOULFUL picks up where our first album left off in regards to song writing  both instrumentally and lyrically. We have reached farther in our story telling with songs like BLUE JEAN that tells of the story of a woman looking back at the meaningful moments in her life and longing for reunification with people she had lost. Looking back over her life, the listener learns the strength of her character and her love of family.</p>
<p>In the song SOMETIMES the listener hears the delicate irony of optimism while being surrounded  be defeat.</p>
<p>These songs are contrasted by fun songs like HOLE IN MY BEER, a very fun country and blues song great for dancin' and WESTERN STRONG which explores issues faced by Western  Canadians.</p>
<p>Instrumentally, we have expanded our horizons. You can hear different influences of music including Reggae and Progressive  Rock, while still sticking to our Roots of Rockin' Country and Blues.</p>
<p>Now we'd like to share those songs with the world! Beginning in the U.K.</p>
<p>We have lined up 20 shows in the U.K. starting in the month of March 2020 to promote our new album due in January 2020!</p>

<h3>What will your contribution do?</h3>
<p>Your contribution will help us move one step closer to realizing our dream of creating and sharing our art with markets that would otherwise be unreachable.</p>
<p>Do you remember the first album you bought? Your first download? The first song that touched your soul? We remember ours, and we want to keep creating those feelings for others for years to come. You will be a part of a worldwide movement to create heartfelt music that millions of people will relate to. AND, you'll be able to say you helped make it happen.</p>
<p>We've been very successful in our past with getting signed to an international distribution deal with Stephen Wrench (voting member on the Grammy awards, and 18 year manager for Lynyrd Skynyrd) of ""Musik and Film Records"" out of the U.S.A. We were signed on our very first song called ""Don't Remember Last Night"" which made it to #9 on the European Independent Music Charts and is all across radio in Canada, the U.S.A. and the U.K. A song about indulging a little too much and wondering, just what the heck happened last night (Some of us can relate - not mentioning any names.. lol..).</p>
<p>Since then, we have recorded our first album (self titled) and are working on our second album called (Soulful) that is scheduled to be released in January 2020 in time for our U.K. tour in March 2020.</p>
<p>This is a real business venture for the founders of The Prairie Dogz and with your assistance, we can get to the next level and start building our worldwide fan base.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>With travel, especially with 5 people, there will always be challenges. Personal, physical, and other intangible issues can and will arise. We have all fought hard to get where we are in music today and we take this opportunity as professional musicians with a plan and goal to create the best show possible each and every night.</p>
<p>We also face other financial challenges we may not have thought about. Travel break downs, canceled gigs and extra living expenses are all possible challenges. But, we are no spring chickens. We are all seasoned in adversity through our lives and understand that ""the show must go on"". We all have other resources to face these challenges if or when they arise.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that you may be struggling. Hell, we are ""starving"" musicians ourselves. So if you can't donate even one dollar, IT'S OKAY.. If you would, please share this so that others that may have the means to help can see this request. Thank you! We love you!</p>

</div></div>","Be part of something that is WORLDWIDE!
Do you want to be part of something that is WORLDWIDE? So you can say ""I had a hand in that!""
So do we!
We have written heartfelt lyrics and offer our fans an exciting show with a blend of Canadian country, rock and blues.
Our second album SOULFUL picks up where our first album left off in regards to song writing  both instrumentally and lyrically. We have reached farther in our story telling with songs like BLUE JEAN that tells of the story of a woman looking back at the meaningful moments in her life and longing for reunification with people she had lost. Looking back over her life, the listener learns the strength of her character and her love of family.
In the song SOMETIMES the listener hears the delicate irony of optimism while being surrounded  be defeat.
These songs are contrasted by fun songs like HOLE IN MY BEER, a very fun country and blues song great for dancin' and WESTERN STRONG which explores issues faced by Western  Canadians.
Instrumentally, we have expanded our horizons. You can hear different influences of music including Reggae and Progressive  Rock, while still sticking to our Roots of Rockin' Country and Blues.
Now we'd like to share those songs with the world! Beginning in the U.K.

<h3>Who Am I and Why Do I Need Your Help?</h3>
<p>Hello. I'm Tom, I've been a professional Recording Engineering and Producer since 2011. In that time I've worked with countless incredible artists and bands (The Fall, Cleft, Body Hound, Grace Davies, Vasa, Wot Gorilla? and Axes to name a few). It is my passion and my joy.</p>
<p>Back in 2014, myself and my best pal Dan Wild-Beesley (guitarist from Cleft, incredibly gifted Recording Engineer and the loveliest dude you could ever hope to meet) hatched a plan to open a studio of our own in Manchester, UK. We got remarkably close to it, had a tenancy agreement to sign and everything but had to abandon the plan at the last minute due to issues with our proposed property we couldn't resolve.</p>
<p>We always planned to keep looking for a spot together but in 2015 Dan got some bad news that shelved our plans indefinitely. Dan was diagnosed with brain cancer.</p>
<p>After 3 years of dealing with the disease, Dan passed away in October 2018. I miss him dearly and think about him every day without fail.</p>
<p>Trapdoor Studios is my way of honouring and remembering Dan and the amazing time we spent together as touring musicians, recording engineers and best friends. I wouldn't have the confidence to do what I do without him.</p>
<p>I moved to Liverpool (my favourite city in the UK) in March 2018 after making the leap to self-employment following 6 years of learning my craft at The Grand Studio in Clitheroe to be amongst a city of great cultural significance and this is where I am choosing to open Trapdoor Studios.  </p>
<p>For those of you who are wondering about the name, Trapdoor is one of my favourite Cleft songs. I think it's got a good ring to it, don't you? Maybe I'll even put a trapdoor in the studio for any guitarists that play Sweet Child O' Mine... </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555524115/hmz3z5jcckwswm7y0paz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p><i>Here's a nice photo of Dan and I taken on the day we decided to open a studio together.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Where Is It?</h3>
<p>I want to create an environment that bands and artists feel they can create their best work. That doesn't mean 'state of the art' or 'super slick' - it means comfortable, relaxed and fun. In an ideal world, I'd be opening Trapdoor Studios in a delightful 17th Century Barn in rural somewhere but try finding one of those in central Liverpool...</p>
<p>What I do have however is a great blank canvas to work from, hiding around the back of Liverpool's Edge Lane area. It may not look much at the moment but when I'm finished with it, it's going to be somewhere you'll happily spend a whole month making a record in.</p>
<p>Here's a couple of snaps of the studio with some clown in the way:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555524985/tdgdovofhkib9z1lyhyi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p><i><i>This will most likely be the control room. Not sure I'll keep the mirror though...</i></i></p>
<p><i><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555525260/n3rxu2hcwfhwkqicplso.jpg"" src=""""/></i></i></p>
<p><i>This is the third room. My plan is to open the partition wall up in order to expand the main Live Room.</i></p>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>It turns out opening a studio is an expensive business. I thought for a while about how best to fund it - I've been wanting to make this a reality for a long time, thought about startup loans, personal loans, robbing a bank etc. but one thing that Dan taught me (amongst many other things) was the power of crowdfunding and the more and more I thought about it, the more and more this made sense. So, here we are.</p>
<p>Going into this, I already have a decent amount of equipment but I'm missing a few key pieces. Up until now, I've tended to hire other studios for my productions but it was always my intention to have my own place. I've slowly been buying up bits and pieces with this intention when I can but there's a big leap to be made from having a few bits and bobs to a full production setup.</p>
<p>The main things I need are:</p>
<p>- Microphones: <i>I have a couple but nowhere near enough to record a drum kit, this is where the bulk of the funding will go.</i></p>
<p>- Pre-amps: <i>The bit you plug the mic into to make it work, duh. I have a few channels already but I need a few more to really make that kit pop.</i></p>
<p>- Stands and cables: <i>Boring stuff but it's far more cost-effective than hiring people to stand around holding microphones for me.</i></p>
<p>- Building materials: <i>Building materials are an expensive but necessary part of the plan. I want the studio to have a really comfortable feel to it and generally feel nice to be in.</i><i> My plan is to put a wooden floor down in the live room and I also need to put in some acoustic treatment in the control room as well as give the place a nice new lick of paint.</i></p>
<p><i>- </i>Other stuff: <i>Cool stuff like a kettle and a fridge and some chairs for people to sit on, that sort of thing.</i></p>
<p>The good news is, I already have tons of instruments and pedals, some great studio focussed gear, a huge box full of assorted cables and various other useful items that I have invested in over the years so all of that will be put to great use at Trapdoor Studios.</p>
<p>It's incredibly important to me that Trapdoor is a facility that artists want to come to and want to make records in. I have no intention of creating a demo facility - sure, this won't be Abbey Road but I want the records that are made at Trapdoor to sound just as good as those made anywhere in the World.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why Support Trapdoor Studios?</h3>
<p>Well, that's a good question. There's plenty of incredibly valid causes that deserve your support far more so I want to be clear that this isn't a charity. Most of the 'perks' are set up for musicians and artists to benefit from Trapdoor Studios once its doors are open. I am offering reduced rates on Production, Mixing and Mastering for a number of different scenarios - it's more like pre-paying for studio time and it means that when the doors are open, we can make amazing records together without missing a beat.</p>
<p>For those of you who are not musicians but would still like to contribute in some way, there are a couple of perks for you too so have a little look through and see what floats your boat.  </p>
<p>In supporting Trapdoor Studios, you're making a daft dream two best pals had come true. I know that's cheesy, but it's 100% true. I want to spend the rest of my life helping people be creative because I know that's what Dan would do and this is the best way I can think to do it.</p>
<p>For some of the bigger perks, feel free to get in touch with me directly to discuss time frames and your release plans.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Like any small venture, there are risks and challenges. Liverpool being a hotbed for creative individuals naturally means there are a number of great studio facilities in the city already. Trapdoor is not a studio designed to rival or pull-away work from existing facilities, more to contribute and add to an already thriving network of fantastic music production.</p>
<p>Those of you who know my work will know that I primarily deal with the weirder end of the Rock Music spectrum, I very much plan to continue in this vein (Dan wouldn't have it any other way) but I also would love to see music of all types coming through the studio. I see this as a vital part of Trapdoor Studios' future.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I recognise that not everyone will be able to contribute financially and that is totally and completely cool. If you want to help but can't afford to, please consider sharing this campaign with your friends on social media.</p>

<h3>About me.</h3>
<p>My name is Ben Smith and I have been performing for over 15 years. After completing a degree in Music Technology, then getting a day job whilst performing as a hobby, I found that my true passion was to perform music in front of people.</p>
<p>I have been performing for various audiences as my full time job for 3 years. I love my job and wish to get my music to more people.</p>
<p>With a little help, I will make this EP (extended play) reach as big an audience as possible.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>I've written the songs for the EP and have already recorded my Vocals and Acoustic Guitar on the tracks. However, I would love to record additional musicians to make each song sound fuller and I need help getting the CD's produced professionally. Any additional funding will help with the production of merchandise, and also a release party.</p>
<p>Budget:- £2000</p>
<ul>
<li>Recording, mixing and mastering - £1200</li>
<li>CD Production - £500</li>
<li>Marketing and Promotion - £150</li>
<li>Artwork - £150</li>
</ul>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm offering various amazing perks depending on how much is donated. Here they are:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Gratitude for making this EP possible.</li>
<li>MP3 version or a physical CD of the EP.</li>
<li>I will come to the venue of your choosing and play a private gig for you (UK only).</li>
<li>A video message and performance of a cover song of your choosing.</li>
<li>Write and record a personalized song of with a theme of your choosing. </li>
<li>Extra Special Thanks:- You have made a huge contribution to the production of this EP. Your name will be on the EP artwork and you will receive a digital copy of the EP as well as a signed physical copy of the EP.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I don't make the full goal, I will still get this album to you. It can be done on a lower budget. I'd just love to make this an amazing professional end product.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This EP will be the turning point of my career and will massively help in getting my music to the masses. </p>
<p>I have previously released singles and albums which have been entirely self-produced and even self manufactured although these have been obviously homemade. With your help, I will release an album which can stand up to chart standards.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I've never done anything like this and have always self funded projects such as this. But with the constraints of having a far lower budget, this has impacted the end product.</p>
<p>No matter what happens, I will release this album. I am very proud of the quality of the music that I've written.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Times are tough, and even if you can't spare anything I would love for you to share this to your friends and family. Or even come to one of my gigs, have a drink and support your local venues.</p>

My name is Breana Raquel, I'm 18 years old and I was born and raised in Southern Maryland. I moved to LA when I was 16 to pursue my career. I'm an actress, singer and songwriter. On February 14th I will be dropping my first EP, and hopefully going on tour the end of March. The process of making my EP was a ton of fun and hard work. I was on track with my plan to get my music out there and people listening until Nov 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2018.

This put touring on the back burner. I've decided I don't want to let my disease hold me back, it's taken enough from me! That is why I'm hoping to move forward with my plan to tour. With the INSANE costs of insulin and other medical devices I use to make sure I stay healthy, savings for the tour have been pretty much depleted. That's why I need your help to get me there. Getting in front of people and sharing my music will make all the struggle worth it. </p><h2><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2><p>The entry fee to perform on the High School tour is $2,500/per week. My hope is to raise enough money to allow me to do 5 weeks (LA, San Francisco, Seattle, Dallas &amp; Houston). The tour includes 5 schools per week with a guaranteed audience - this is what I'm most excited about - the opportunity to share my music with so many would be amazing! So the total amount needed is $12,500 to cover the 5 weeks. If I don't reach the full amount, then I will perform the number of weeks the funds will allow. My parents said that if I'm able to raise the entry fees - they would find a way to cover the transportation and lodging costs.</p><p>I kinda felt like there was supposed to be a picture here - but really, none seem to fit with the text.

<br/>Hope you enjoyed the quick break!! Now, back to business....</div><div>
<div> </div>
<div>My parents were a little hesitant about me doing a campaign ""asking for money"", they are VERY hard workers and pretty much my whole life they’ve held second jobs or some sort of business venture, so this just didn't really sit well with them. But after a bit they agreed with the stipulation that donors would get something in return - so my mom and I came up with a few 'perks' we think you're going to love! We tried to make sure all donors were acknowledged, because we are truly grateful for any amount donated! Some perks I'm super excited about are the handwritten lyrics of one of my songs, a video chat, a coffee meet up in LA and an in person listening session in LA. I wanted the perks to be more personable because I'd love to actually connect with you all!<br/> </div>
</div><h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2><p><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src="""" hspace=""12"" src=""""/>One of my greatest fears is that I have put my soul into writing and recording these songs and NO ONE will hear them! This is why I could not just accept that I wasn't able to go on tour because of my Type 1 “drama”. Going on this tour GUARANTEES me an audience. The tour is 5 weeks and each week I’ll perform at 5 different high schools that have 2,000-4,000 students.

<h2><strong>Story</strong></h2>
<p>The last couple years have been about new beginnings, with ends to my long-term relationship, job and band.  Broken Ocean is in part about the real Ocean, but also about different symbolic Oceans (heart, mind, spirit) that make us extraordinary and unique.  The songs draw from recent events and also reflections on the loss of my mother, who originally supported my musical interests.  While these topics can be serious, I often try to give songs a more upbeat or contrasting feel (with occasional sarcasm) to let the idea be expressed, but in an easier to digest way.</p>
<p>I’ve been playing music since I was 6 and started recording on a Tascam (cassette-tape) 4 track when I was 12. While in bands with others, I’ve participated in creating 7 EPs and 1 Full-length album, but never a solo record.  Music has always helped me to deal with issues or just generally to soothe my soul.  My hope is that these songs can do that for others.</p>
<p>After 3 years of persistent effort, the songs are finally all together and I just need to finish mixing, mastering and duplication.  I am hoping to complete these tasks for $3,633 and am looking to raise $2,250 to help offset this cost.  If by an act of nature, I raised more than needed to finish, this would go towards album promotion.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>         Frontera Bugalú was established in 2012 in El Paso, Texas as a project to fill the ever-growing need for Latin music in El Paso. The group specializes in cumbia but also works with other Caribbean and Mexican rhythms. The group has released two albums of original music and are working on their third. </p>
<p>          Your support will help produce the new music video and finish an album that has been in the works for two years. The video will feature the single ""Respirar"", which means to breathe, and is an account of the last few minutes of a gruesome death typical of the border. We hope to provide a different viewpoint on the ongoing controversies surrounding US policy towards Mexico and Latin America. We feel music allows people to ""feel"" through an argument instead of it being about politics, elections, and numbers.  Stories like this happen to real human beings and music allows us to express the sadness, anger, and desperation that many of us feel. </p>
</div><div>
<p>  This will be a collaboration with accomplished video producer Paco Ibarra, whose talent you can see in the video ""Alma de Jaguar"" which is available on this page.  Paco has worked with many big music acts and brings a whole new level of artistry to the project.

<h3>Singing the Journey</h3>
<p>A pilgrimage is a spiritual road trip. It’s not always to faraway places. We can be pilgrims even when we think we’re standing still. Along the way, songs are often our companions. They can move us to explore and help us figure out where we’re going. That’s the idea behind my new collection of musical stories, “Pilgrim Souls.""</p>
<p>My own pilgrimage has stretched over six albums and 30 years, and it's taken me places I never could have dreamed. My songs have been recorded by Americana artists like Slaid Cleaves, Russell Crowe and Christine Albert. I've written a song-a-week for Jim Hightower's radio show and been six-time World Pun Champion. I've spoken from more than 30 pulpits on topics like “Songwriting As a Spiritual Path.” My last album, ""I'll Take You Home,"" got me invited to join the legendary '60s folk group The Limeliters. You can check it all out at <a href=""http://www.stevebrooks.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.stevebrooks.net</a>.</p>
<p>Now, I'm positioned to build on that success, with three years' and 50,000 miles' worth of new tunes. With your support, I'll record them, with veteran Austin producer Fletcher Clark, of Armadillo World Headquarters fame. I'll promote the record with a proven strategy, getting them heard by new audiences on new stages nationwide.</p>
<p>What's your personal pilgrimage? What does it mean to live your own dream? These are the kinds of questions these songs explore. I'm grateful that so many friends, including the 160 who funded my last album, have taken my songs along on their own voyages. I hope these new ones will inspire you on yours, and that you'll join me on mine.</p>
<h3>Songs for the Road</h3>
<p><i>(Click ""Listen"" to hear rough mixes: a music player will open in a new tab. If you're on a phone, hit the back arrow to return to this page after you've listened.)</i></p>
<p><strong>Somebody Else's Dream</strong>. Whose dream have I been living, anyway? Written with Ivan Boudreau. <a href=""https://stevebrooks.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SomebodyElsesDream-2.mp3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Listen</a></p>
<p><strong>A Glacier's Tears</strong>. The life and death of a glacier - from the glacier's point of view. Written with Mala Gassman.  <a href=""https://stevebrooks.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GlaciersTears-Scratch-Mix.mp3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Listen</a></p>
<p><strong>En Mis Sueños (In My Dreams)</strong>. In a bittersweet story from today's headlines, love crosses borders when people can't. Written with Sue Young.  <a href=""https://stevebrooks.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/EnMisSue%C3%B1osduet.mp3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Listen</a></p>
<p><strong>Another Pilgrim Soul</strong>. Life is a pilgrimage - inspired by a line from my favorite poet, Yeats.</p>
<p><a href=""https://stevebrooks.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GlaciersTears-Scratch-Mix.mp3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">​</a><strong>Some People You Never Get Over</strong>. A tribute to loves we've left behind, and yet are still with us.</p>
<p><strong>Do Right by People</strong>. How do we take care of our fellow travelers?</p>
<p><strong>The Song is My Home</strong>. Why I write songs, inspired by a comment from Merle Haggard.</p>
<p><strong>The French Quarter of My Mind</strong>. A dream noir about a piece of my psychic real estate. </p>
<p><strong>The Road to Adios</strong>. Soundtrack to a fictional spaghetti western, about two old cowpokes on their last ride. Written with Randy Brown.</p>
<p>And three more to be chosen...</p>
<h3>What You'll Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Along with a unique collection of songs come some unique rewards. All rewards include a CD and/or digital download before the album's official release date. For higher levels of support, you can also get all my previous albums and complete lyrics and chords to those albums. You can get a live concert or campfire without leaving home. You can get a songwriting lesson or commission an original song. You can even get a gourmet Cajun meal, cooked by the artist in your kitchen. Plus, most perks come with a little lagniappe: a bumpersticker and koozie. Click any perk on the right side of this page to get full details. When you find the package you'd like, click ""Get This Perk.""</p>
<h3>What Your Participation Will Do</h3>
<p>My last album raised my career to a new level. It also taught me a lot about the most effective ways to make and promote a record in today's DIY world. Here's the difference your participation will make, and a breakdown of the $7,500 it will take to make and promote this album:</p>
<ul>
<li>$3,500 for recording at Armadillo Music Productions in Lockhart, Texas.</li>
<li>$1,500 for manufacturing (I do the artwork myself).</li>
<li>$1,500 for U.S. folk radio promotion, building on the buzz from my last two records, played on over 100 stations.</li>
<li>$1,000 for showcasing at music conferences, to meet and play for more of the presenters who book concert series. ​</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>A Note on Paypal and Personal Checks</h3>
<p>Indiegogo now accepts credit cards only. Regrettably, it no longer accepts Paypal - a fact to which I was not alerted until this campaign was already launched. The good news is that I do accept  Paypal - it just involves the extra step of going to Paypal's website. If you prefer to contribute through Paypal, you can send a payment to guitarfrog59@yahoo.com. Please mention ""Pilgrim Souls"" in the note and include which perk you'd like. Once I receive your contribution, I will donate an equivalent amount to Indiegogo, so that your contribution adds to the running campaign total and helps to put this campaign over the top. I'm very sorry for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>If you prefer to pay by personal check, please contact me at guitarfrog59@yahoo.com for a snail mail address. As with Paypal, your contribution will get added to the overall total.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Take Part</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Word of mouth is the key to campaigns like this. If you have friends who might enjoy discovering my songs, I invite you to invite them to check out this project. Even if your dinero is nada, you can participate in important ways by spreading the word. Online tools make it easy to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share a link to this campaign with friends, on Facebook, Twitter or email.</li>
<li>Let friends know why you think this record is worthy of their support.</li>
<li>Use the sharing tools right here on Indiegogo, or cut and paste this link: <a href=""https://igg.me/at/pilgrimsouls"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://igg.me/at/pilgrimsouls</a>.</li>
<li>Share my website <a href=""https://www.stevebrooks.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.stevebrooks.net </a>or my Indiegogo video <a href=""https://youtu.be/wHHqYL_c-R8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://youtu.be/wHHqYL_c-R8</a> with friends.</li>
</ul>
<p>I can't thank you enough for taking the time to check out ""Pilgrim Souls."" I hope you'll enjoy checking out the music and the rewards, and I hope you'll join me in bringing these songs from Austin to the world.</p>
<p>Peace through Music,</p>

The Song is My Home. Why I write songs, inspired by a comment from Merle Haggard.
The French Quarter of My Mind. A dream noir about a piece of my psychic real estate.

What You'll Get

Along with a unique collection of songs come some unique rewards. All rewards include a CD and/or digital download before the album's official release date. For higher levels of support, you can also get all my previous albums and complete lyrics and chords to those albums. You can get a live concert or campfire without leaving home. You can get a songwriting lesson or commission an original song. You can even get a gourmet Cajun meal, cooked by the artist in your kitchen. Plus, most perks come with a little lagniappe: a bumpersticker and koozie. Click any perk on the right side of this page to get full details. When you find the package you'd like, click ""Get This Perk.""
What Your Participation Will Do
My last album raised my career to a new level. It also taught me a lot about the most effective ways to make and promote a record in today's DIY world. Here's the difference your participation will make, and a breakdown of the $7,500 it will take to make and promote this album:

$3,500 for recording at Armadillo Music Productions in Lockhart, Texas.
$1,500 for manufacturing (I do the artwork myself).
$1,500 for U.S. folk radio promotion, building on the buzz from my last two records, played on over 100 stations.
$1,000 for showcasing at music conferences, to meet and play for more of the presenters who book concert series. ​


A Note on Paypal and Personal Checks
Indiegogo now accepts credit cards only. Regrettably, it no longer accepts Paypal - a fact to which I was not alerted until this campaign was already launched. The good news is that I do accept  Paypal - it just involves the extra step of going to Paypal's website. If you prefer to contribute through Paypal, you can send a payment to guitarfrog59@yahoo.com. Please mention ""Pilgrim Souls"" in the note and include which perk you'd like. Once I receive your contribution, I will donate an equivalent amount to Indiegogo, so that your contribution adds to the running campaign total and helps to put this campaign over the top. I'm very sorry for the inconvenience.
If you prefer to pay by personal check, please contact me at guitarfrog59@yahoo.com for a snail mail address. As with Paypal, your contribution will get added to the overall total.
Other Ways You Can Take Part

Word of mouth is the key to campaigns like this. If you have friends who might enjoy discovering my songs, I invite you to invite them to check out this project. Even if your dinero is nada, you can participate in important ways by spreading the word. Online tools make it easy to do:

Share a link to this campaign with friends, on Facebook, Twitter or email.
Let friends know why you think this record is worthy of their support.
Use the sharing tools right here on Indiegogo, or cut and paste this link: https://igg.me/at/pilgrimsouls.
Share my website www.stevebrooks.net or my Indiegogo video https://youtu.be/wHHqYL_c-R8 with friends.

I can't thank you enough for taking the time to check out ""Pilgrim Souls."" I hope you'll enjoy checking out the music and the rewards, and I hope you'll join me in bringing these songs from Austin to the world.
Peace through Music,

<p>I’m making <strong>the album of my dreams. </strong>No, really. I have dreamt vivid dreams detailing the concept of this album repeatedly over the last year. I have woken up every day knowing of it’s coming existence. Well, here we are. It’s finally time to make my debut album. It is <strong>eleven songs.</strong> It is eleven parts of me. I am so excited to share them with you that I could just fly! (I won’t though...it's time to get to work!)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>There’s also a book</strong>—filled with stories, verses, memories, photos, and excerpts from my life that formed the songs. It’s personal. Like, really personal. <strong><i>The Book </i></strong>is a look into why I wrote every word of every song.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I believe in these songs.

I’ve hired some of the <strong>best people</strong>, plan to record in some of the <strong>best places</strong>, and plan on bringing the <strong>best final product</strong>.

<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>Revolution, I Love You. A band. From Philadelphia.</p>
<p>We've been making music since 2008, touring up and down the east coast and throughout the mid-atlantic region. We've performed live on radio stations, released several EP's and singles, and one full length album. We've even got a song in the British Library (like the library of congress, but more...British).</p>
<p>This is our second full length album and our first record since adding our beloved drummer Jeff to our lineup. </p>

<h3>So what's the $$$ for?</h3>
<p>We've put a lot of time and effort into writing and recording our new album and now we've finished. However, there's more to putting out an album then just getting the tunes recorded. We need to have the album mastered and, as part of the release for Black Feathers, we'd like to deliver two beautiful music videos.</p>

<h3>Short on bread but still want to help?</h3>
<p>Totally understandable. Honestly, it would mean the world to us if you could help us spread the word about our campaign. Share our campaign on social media, reach out to a friend who you think would be interested and just generally aid in the hustle! We appreciate any  help you can give.</p>

<p>Hello! My name is Luna Cave. I am a 16 year old singer songwriter with a passion for music. I am raising money to record and market my first album. It would mean so much to me to record this album, especially because I am recording it at the Institute for the Musical Arts, a recording studio/summer camp/organization with a mission of supporting young women in music. IMA has helped me so much as a musician and as a person, so recording there and putting money back into a place that helped me get where I am today would be an incredible experience.</p> <p>Our Budget</p>
<p>$2,000 Recording Studio time</p>
<p>$2,000 Sound engineering, arranging and background instrumentation (Lee Madeloni)</p>
<p>$1,000 Additional instrumentals, co-producing (Naia Kete)</p>
<p>$2,000 Pressing physical CDs, early marketing and advertising</p> <p>Perks</p>
<p>$5 and over: You will be included in my next Instagram ¨Thank You!¨ post.</p>
<p>$50 and over: I’ll send you a happy birthday song on your birthday</p>
<p>$500 and over: I’ll write you a song about a subject of your choice (I reserve the right to ask you to choose again if I’m not comfortable with the topic)</p> <p>The Impact</p> <p>This would be my first album, and my first opportunity to show my music to a larger audience. I plan on using this album as a way to begin what will hopefully be a long career in the music industry. I want to use this opportunity to use my full voice as a songwriter, collaborating with people who allow me to use my honest and authentic vision. This method of recording my first album is a very special experience because I will be able to put out music that I have creative control over, which is rare in the music industry. </p> <p>Risks and Challenges</p> <p>Some risks to putting this album out are that I have a lot of money to raise in a short period of time. It is important that we make this recording in February because the collaborators on this album, Lee Madeloni and Naia Kete, will be in my area, as they usually live in California, and I have a week off of school.

<p>Par ce nouvel album, nous souhaitons faire découvrir la musique du compositeur géorgien<strong> Giya Kancheli,</strong> dont les qualités artistiques méritent d'être mieux connues et appréciées. Kancheli a beaucoup écrit pour le cinéma et le théâtre durant sa vie. Par ses ""miniatures"" pour violon et piano, piano solo, ainsi que violon, piano et bandonéon, nous cherchons à partager avec un plus vaste public,  une musique à la fois mélancolique et lumineuse, empreinte de beauté et d'espoir. </p>
<p>La musique, nous dit Kancheli ,<i>""comme la vie elle-même, est inconcevable sans romantisme. Le romantisme est un rêve du passé, du présent et du futur, une force dont la beauté invincible domine et vainc les forces de l'ignorance, de la bigoterie, de la violence et du mal.</i>"" </p>

<p>Our Duo has been collaborating in performances and recordings for many years. Our two previous recordings of sonatas by <a href=""https://metis-islands.com/2012/04/05/mim-004/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Szymanowski and Shostakovich </a>(MI-0004) and <a href=""https://metis-islands.com/2015/05/01/mim-006/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lekeu-Franck</a> (MI-0006) were well received by critics here in Canada and abroad. </p>
<p>In this new recording, we present music written for cinema and theatre by the great Georgian composer,<strong> Giya Kancheli,</strong> whose human and artistic values deserve to reach a wider audience. With the collaboration of Jonathan Goldman (Bandoneon), in arrangements for violin and piano, piano solo as well as bandoneon/violin/piano, we revisit some of the composer's most beautiful, melancholic, bitter sweet yet luminous music. </p>
<p>As Kancheli said ,""<i>Music, like life itself, is inconceivable without romanticism. Romanticism is a high dream of the past, present, and future--a force of invincible beauty which towers above, and conquers, the forces of ignorance, bigotry, violence, and evil."" </i></p>

<h3>Origins and the <i>Ser Artista</i> Album Project</h3>
<p><strong>Orale! </strong>I am a queer Xicana singer-songwriter, guitarist, poet, composer, video documentary and music video filmmaker, and scholar. You can learn more about my work here: <a href=""http://www.diana-alvarez.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.diana-alvarez.com</a>.</p>
<p>While working on my PhD in Electronic Arts at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, I composed and staged <i>Quiero Volver: A Xicanx Ritual Opera</i>. This multimedia performance features my original music to honor the lives and work of women, non-binary and genderqueer artists of color. <i>Quiero Volver</i> was recognized by the press as a “visually and acoustically stunning performance” and raised over $10,000 to support immigrant justice initiatives when it was staged at the Academy of Music (Northampton, MA) in 2018.</p>
<p><strong>I want to record and release my first studio album</strong>, <strong><i>Ser Artista</i></strong> to share the music from my composition, <i>Quiero Volver: A Xicanx Ritual Opera,</i> plus newer songs with you and with the world! My bilingual, soulful songs exalt queer love, liberation, ancestral lineage, and fiercely sing out against oppression. </p>
<p><strong>Here is what others have generously said about my work:</strong></p>
<p><i>""The virtuosic vocal finesse of Diana Alvarez is a wonder and a privilege to behold--and no surprise to witness every audience stunned into silent awe and transcendence.""</i> -Pamela Means</p>
<p><i>""Soulful and natural.""</i> -Natalie Merchant</p>
<p><i>""Diana’s voice, her ability to shift the room by allowing her research to inform her choices of sound, song selection, and phrasing is simply remarkable. For me personally, even on YouTube - her Quiero Volver: A Xicanx Ritual Opera trailer recalibrates my mood. This is true of so many of the women of color artists before her, like Bessie Smith for example – who was said to have been able to conjure with her voice."" </i>-Sharon Bridgforth</p>
<p><i>""Diana Alvarez writes the truth through a tincture of magic and prayer, and both the spirits and the living are cupping their ears to listen.""</i> -Sean Nevin</p>
<p><strong>Should you contribute to the Ser Artista album project</strong>, <strong>you will support me, a queer Xicana performer</strong> who is the first in my family to attend college (let alone pursue and earn a PhD), whose work embodies coalition building and uprooting oppression, and who is committed to building family and community through performance.</p>
<p><strong>I call myself science fiction,</strong> because I am in awe of where I've ended up after growing up motherless and raised by working class familia and mentors. I figure that if I can make a PhD and music career happen coming from no money and limited resources, I can make this album happen with help from my community! In return, I will continue to create performance gatherings for QPOC, activists, and artists with amazing collaborators. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Let's Make This Album Happen!</h3>
<p>I have calculated that minimal costs to produce <i>Ser Artista</i> will be $12,000. Your funding will support the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Co-Producer Fees</li>
<li>Studio Fees (Recording, Mixing, Mastering)</li>
<li>Studio Musician Fees (Rehearsal and Recording)</li>
<li>Artwork/Graphic Design</li>
<li>CD Printing/Distribution</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My superpower as an artist is to build up new(er) artists to own their craft.</strong> My perks for this campaign will include<strong> art work and lessons from collaborating artists who share my values, lessons and mentorship sessions with me, house concerts, birthday serenades, video editing sessions, and much more.</strong> If you are interested in supporting artists who nurture arts education and/or your own artistic journey, you've stopped at the right place.</p>
<p>Should I not reach my entire goal, I plan to still record and release music. I will scale down the project according to the budget. So, I might release an EP with fewer musical collaborators. Still a dream, just a more modest one. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>I Make Things Happen</h3>
<p>Here are a few unbelievable things I've accomplished:</p>
<ul>
<li>I continue to survive the early loss of my mother at age seven, plus the loss of most of my family (this has become a huge theme in my work, and why I center work around building chosen family)</li>
<li>I am the first in my family to earn a BA!</li>
<li>I am the first in my family to earn an MFA in Poetry!</li>
<li>I am the first in my family (and probably many families, for crying out loud) to earn a PhD in Electronic Arts</li>
<li>I composed and staged an original opera TWICE before completing my doctorate</li>
<li>Said opera raised $10,000 to support immigrant justice</li>
<li>I continue to heal, survive, create, teach, and inspire others to create art, though ""We were never meant to survive"" (Audre Lorde)</li>
<li>I build community for queer people of color, activists, and artists through regular performances, workshops, and events</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My <i>Ser Artista</i> album is one way to ensure that more people will hear my music, and that I continue to perform and tour with songs of liberation, queer love, and art.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I'd be honored to have you join me on this journey.</strong></p>

</div></div>","Origins and the Ser Artista Album Project
Orale! I am a queer Xicana singer-songwriter, guitarist, poet, composer, video documentary and music video filmmaker, and scholar. You can learn more about my work here: www.diana-alvarez.com.
While working on my PhD in Electronic Arts at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, I composed and staged Quiero Volver: A Xicanx Ritual Opera. This multimedia performance features my original music to honor the lives and work of women, non-binary and genderqueer artists of color. Quiero Volver was recognized by the press as a “visually and acoustically stunning performance” and raised over $10,000 to support immigrant justice initiatives when it was staged at the Academy of Music (Northampton, MA) in 2018.
I want to record and release my first studio album, Ser Artista to share the music from my composition, Quiero Volver: A Xicanx Ritual Opera, plus newer songs with you and with the world! My bilingual, soulful songs exalt queer love, liberation, ancestral lineage, and fiercely sing out against oppression. 
Here is what others have generously said about my work:
""The virtuosic vocal finesse of Diana Alvarez is a wonder and a privilege to behold--and no surprise to witness every audience stunned into silent awe and transcendence."" -Pamela Means
""Soulful and natural."" -Natalie Merchant
""Diana’s voice, her ability to shift the room by allowing her research to inform her choices of sound, song selection, and phrasing is simply remarkable. For me personally, even on YouTube - her Quiero Volver: A Xicanx Ritual Opera trailer recalibrates my mood. This is true of so many of the women of color artists before her, like Bessie Smith for example – who was said to have been able to conjure with her voice."" -Sharon Bridgforth
""Diana Alvarez writes the truth through a tincture of magic and prayer, and both the spirits and the living are cupping their ears to listen."" -Sean Nevin
Should you contribute to the Ser Artista album project, you will support me, a queer Xicana performer who is the first in my family to attend college (let alone pursue and earn a PhD), whose work embodies coalition building and uprooting oppression, and who is committed to building family and community through performance.
I call myself science fiction, because I am in awe of where I've ended up after growing up motherless and raised by working class familia and mentors. I figure that if I can make a PhD and music career happen coming from no money and limited resources, I can make this album happen with help from my community! In return, I will continue to create performance gatherings for QPOC, activists, and artists with amazing collaborators. 

Let's Make This Album Happen!
I have calculated that minimal costs to produce Ser Artista will be $12,000. Your funding will support the following:

Co-Producer Fees
Studio Fees (Recording, Mixing, Mastering)
Studio Musician Fees (Rehearsal and Recording)
Artwork/Graphic Design
CD Printing/Distribution

My superpower as an artist is to build up new(er) artists to own their craft. My perks for this campaign will include art work and lessons from collaborating artists who share my values, lessons and mentorship sessions with me, house concerts, birthday serenades, video editing sessions, and much more. If you are interested in supporting artists who nurture arts education and/or your own artistic journey, you've stopped at the right place.
Should I not reach my entire goal, I plan to still record and release music. I will scale down the project according to the budget. So, I might release an EP with fewer musical collaborators. Still a dream, just a more modest one. 

I Make Things Happen
Here are a few unbelievable things I've accomplished:

I continue to survive the early loss of my mother at age seven, plus the loss of most of my family (this has become a huge theme in my work, and why I center work around building chosen family)
I am the first in my family to earn a BA!
I am the first in my family to earn an MFA in Poetry!
I am the first in my family (and probably many families, for crying out loud) to earn a PhD in Electronic Arts
I composed and staged an original opera TWICE before completing my doctorate
Said opera raised $10,000 to support immigrant justice
I continue to heal, survive, create, teach, and inspire others to create art, though ""We were never meant to survive"" (Audre Lorde)
I build community for queer people of color, activists, and artists through regular performances, workshops, and events

My Ser Artista album is one way to ensure that more people will hear my music, and that I continue to perform and tour with songs of liberation, queer love, and art.
I'd be honored to have you join me on this journey.

This is Risky Business!
Pursuing art, music, and performance is risky business because although art is crucial to our survival, we live in a world that doesn't always assign it value. We are also living in challenging times, when disposable income to support independent artists is just not an option for many. 
I am invested in seeing my first studio album, Ser Artista through to its completion. Should I not meet my entire campaign goal, I will aim for a more modest recording in the form of an EP. Either way, I will create something to honor your contributions and faith in my work.

<h3>Here is my story</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Michael Lington, a contemporary jazz, R&amp;B, and Soul saxophonist. I've been making records for over 22 years, and my latest (10th solo album) SILVER LINING was released in June of 2018. Over the years I've been signed to different record labels but in 2013 I decided to start my own label, COPENHAGEN MUSIC, and start releasing my own albums. The record business is constantly changing and my decision to do it on my own was so that I could be in control of my own destiny and continue to release music that was authentic to me. I teamed up with amazing distribution and marketing partners but as you can imagine; it's not cheap to record an album with world class musicians, artists, engineers and studios...that's where I need your help!</p>
<p>I know how much music means to you because it does to me too. As the world seems to become more divided I know that music brings us back together in unity and harmony. I see it at every show that I do and through all the messages I receive, that's why it's so important to continue to release new music. The holidays are also a time where we come together. I've wanted to make a Christmas album for many years and decided now is the right time to make it happen.  I'm also following it up with a 26 date Christmas tour as a special guest with Dave Koz and Friends Christmas- alongside Dave Koz, Jonathan Butler and Melissa Manchester.</p>
<p>Much of the recording has already taken place with an All-Star group of studio musicians and many Special Guests. It sounds amazing and I'm very excited about it! I have personally already spent $11.000 but I need the funds to finish the project with additional recording, mixing, mastering, artwork,duplication and Marketing. This is where you can help! My budget shows I need an additional $15.000 to finish it all, as an independent artist I don't have the funding the major labels have so I need your help. </p>

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>First off, I'd like to thank you for making it this far! I was born and raised in Chicago and cut my teeth on the local scene backing and touring with some of the finest artists on the planet such as Buddy Guy, Sugar Blue and the late great, Queen of the Blues, Koko Taylor. I released my first album, ""Eyes of the City"", in 2008 which was followed three years later by my second release, ""Basic Blue"" in 2011.</p>
<p>I have spent the last four years writing and recording this, my third, and by far, most ambitious release. During the making of this record I had the pleasure of working with artists from as far and wide as Pittsburgh, New Haven, New York, Nashville, Berlin, Los Angeles, Eastern Europe and, of course, my hometown of Chicago! Seeing this project come to life has been one of the most fulfilling artistic experiences of my lifetime and I hope that you will share in this excitement and join me in getting it across the finish line!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With the tracking and mixing phases of the project having already been completed, the remaining phases of the project are where I am seeking your help. Here's a breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Artwork  - $1500</li>
<li>Manufacturing - $2000</li>
<li>Postage &amp; Shipping Supplies - $1000</li>
<li>Promotion (print, radio, social media) - $3000</li>
<li>Incidental expenses (fees, taxes, etc.) - 500</li>
<li><i>Any funds over the $8000 goal will go toward purchasing additional print ads and/or producing one or more music videos</i></li>
</ul>
<p>The campaign is structured so that everyone that contributes is rewarded. We've got some pretty cool swag waiting for ya too!</p>
<ul>
<li>Autographed CDs</li>
<li>Autographed tour posters</li>
<li>Digital downloads</li>
<li>T-shirts</li>
<li>Skype guitar lessons</li>
<li>Framed copies of the new CD</li>
<li>Attend a mastering session</li>
<li>Co-executive producer's credit</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As an independent artist and label-owner, I've learned a lot of valuable lessons over the course of releasing my first two projects: ""Eyes of the City"" and ""Basic Blue"". One of the most valuable lessons was in gaining a better understanding of the importance of promotion in the success of a release. This time out, should we hit our goal, a minimum of $3000 will go towards promotion, which is about four times what we spent for my last release!</p>
<p>In addition to hiring a professional promotional team for print, social media, terrestrial and internet radio promotion, I will also be leveraging my own social media network and the sizable network of industry contacts that I have assembled over the course of the my last two releases.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Seeing as recording and mixing for this project are done we're in a very good place as we already have a record to work with. The biggest challenge at this point is just in funding the final phases of the project. Should this campaign fall far short of the goal, I do have a few cost-cutting contingencies in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go with a digital-only release initially (worst case!).</li>
<li>Print a limited number of physical copies initially to cover perks, pre-release  and, promotional copies.</li>
<li>Print special low-cost promo copies for radio and reviews</li>
<li>Do the cover artwork myself... </li>
</ul>
<p>I will also be contributing more of my own funds (no swag for me though...), and as a last and least-desirable resort, I am prepared to auction off a few pieces of gear and perhaps a couple of guitars if I have to.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand not everyone can contribute financially. However, there are other ways to support the campaign, either by sharing the campaign on social media or sending the link to your friends and family. By spreading the word you'll be bringing attention to the project (and the music!) and any help that you can give is very much appreciated! If you decide to share on Social Media, please be sure to use the Indiegogo sharing tools on this page.</p>
<p>I'd like thank you for taking the time to read and listen and for showing interest in the project. I'd also like to thank all the people who helped me launch this campaign, and to my friends and fans who have supported me over the years. It's because of you that this project was even possible in the first place!<br/><br/>Very thrilled to be able to share this new music with you!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Carolina Cury and I'm a pianist from Venice, doing a Master at Trinity Laban Conservatoire of London, and I'm also a singer and songwriter. Some months ago I released my album ""Carnaval"" and my first music video. I'm now working with my talented friend Camilla Dazzi to make the video of another song: Figurinha. I wouldn't be able to pay myself to make our ideas come true since life in London is very expensive and also the university fees.</p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We are asking for 1500£ funding.

This place is incredible, but they ask for 250£ per hour :(</p>
<p>The more funds we get, the more and the better we can use that space!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution could make a huge difference, both for me and for Camilla, as we could also buy costumes, technical equipment and other expenses that could make the product shine.

<h2><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></h2>
<p>My name is Joshua James, saxophonist, composer, music director, and band-leader for Detroit's <strong><i>Theatre Bizarre Orchestra.  </i></strong>When not performing I work as an educator and  activist for music in schools and the community. Through the <strong><i>TBO</i></strong>, I have been able to present concerts of original, thought-provoking music that appeals to a wide audience, all while engaging and educating listeners in the music creation process. As an ensemble we create and present music that is one part jazz, one part vaudeville, one part circus, and wholly fantastical. In every performance, composition, and album we've presented, our connection with our audience has been our most important and inspiring thread. <u>We believe strongly in the importance of music in people's lives, and that all should have access to participating in the live creation of art.  </u></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>It is therefore our mission to present a live musical concert (and recording) at the Bohm Theater in Albion, MI, which is free and open to the public, that seeks to engage the audience by serving and fostering the artistic culture of the community itself. Further, all students of music throughout the community will be invited to partake in a masterclass prior to the concert, allowing each to interact with the various performers.</strong></i></p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">As an alumnus of Albion College, I learned the importance of art in the lives of people, having had my own relationship with music fostered and nurtured through my various teachers. I also learned how vital ""community"" is to art and its creation. (Nothing is created in a vacuum.)</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Albion, MI, has had a long and diverse relationship with music through the years; Albion College was once a piano conservatory for women in the late 19th century, a many notable jazz and blues artists claim Albion as their birthplace. As a factory town, however, <a href=""http://www.cityofalbionmi.gov/residents/city_at_a_glance/history.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Albion</a> saw diminishing economic opportunities as the factories closed over time.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Since those closures the town has sought to revitalize itself by reconnecting with its artistic past. The local residents, businesses, and college have all worked diligently to foster a community of diversity and inclusion, with music being central to that cause.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">I want to be a part of that revitalization, to contribute to a community that has given so much, and to connect (and reconnect) with my own artistic truth.</p>

</li></ul>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Central to Albion's renaissance has been the restoration of its old movie theater, the <a href=""http://bohmtheatre.org/about/history/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bohm</a>. Dating back to the silent film era, the Bohm theater stands tall in Albion's city center. With a large stage and gorgeous balcony--even the original organ used for accompanying silent films is still intact--the Bohm has <strong><i>fantastic acoustics </i></strong>, making it the perfect venue for both a concert and live recording. But that is only part of the story.</p>

<ul><li><h3><strong>Why a live album recording?</strong></h3></li></ul>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The answer to <i>this</i> question will take a little longer to explain, but it's worth the time.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">In 2017 we released the album <a href=""https://www.discogs.com/Theatre-Bizarre-Orchestra-Dance-With-The-Devil/release/11002583"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i><strong>“Dance with the Devil.”</strong></i> </a>  Since live performances are an integral part of the ensemble’s identity, I conceived of an album that would ultimately be a live recording of a music concert, hoping to capture the energy created between the audience and the musicians. In April of that year, we successfully recorded 10 compositions—two of which were tributes to the late “Duke” Ellington—featuring a full jazz big band augmented with violin, tuba, banjo, and vibraphone, before a sold-out crowd of 224 people at Detroit’s historic Scarab Club, a gallery and artist space behind the Detroit Institute of Arts. The excitement and energy of both audience and ensemble was palpable, and the recording itself captured every bit of that energy. <i><strong>In 2018, much to the delight (and surprise) of all involved, “Dance with the Devil” won a Detroit Music Award for outstanding jazz recording. </strong></i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554736954/piuevy1xc072ipteclfc.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">That evening is still talked about by our fans, as is the record itself, a favorite of many music critics, including Ann Delisi of WDET, Linda Yohn at WEMU, and the staff at WRCJ (Detroit), WBEZ (Chicago), WWOZ (New Orleans), and WNYC (NYC). (The entire process of recording that album harkened back to an older era of music recording that sought to capture the essence of the live performance more so than the recording techniques of today.) Since then musicians of the TBO, our fans, and music critics/curators have urged us to attempt another production such as this one. <i><strong>Little did we know how impactful that experience would be to the music world.</strong></i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554737075/d3kijc1jstc2mvl3gqry.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Roughly eight months ago we befriended a great Michigan-based audio engineer and drummer who, so inspired by that album and my recording process, sought to recreate the magic of that night. Our producer is a student of a more traditional style of recording large ensembles, not unlike the methods of <i><strong>Capitol Records</strong></i>, and the great Frank Sinatra album “<a href=""https://www.allmusic.com/album/sinatras-swingin-session%21%21%21-and-more-mw0000191853/releases"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sinatra’s Swingin’ Session.""</a></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The process entails having a nice, large room, with only a handful of RCA-type ribbon mics placed strategically in that room, with everyone performing the music live. There would be no overdubbing, no studio trickery, just live music playing. In short, we wanted to recreate the success of that first recording in Detroit, but this time on a much larger scale, in Albion, MI. <strong>Our mission was clear: <i>present another live concert album recording</i>.</strong> We only needed to find the right venue for the project: <i><strong>The Bohm Theater!</strong></i></p>
<ul><li><h3><strong>Why this project?</strong></h3></li></ul>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Part of what made that first recording project in 2017 such a success, beyond the fantastic acoustics of the room itself, was the connection we had with the audience, which stemmed from how the concert was presented. We programmed the evening similar to the <i><strong>Young People’s Concert Series</strong></i> of old, featuring Leonard Bernstein; we talked about the music, we engaged the audience with the musicians, and we explained what we were doing and what to listen for. Apart from the  Scarab Club’s room tone, this audience engagement was an important artistic objective, which ultimately became the key component of the album’s overwhelming success. With that in mind, and in partnership with our producer and recording engineer, we arrived at the artistic direction and rationale for this next recording project:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;text-align: center;""><i><strong>To foster the purest connection between audience and ensemble, and to faithfully capture that connection on recording. </strong></i></p>

BACKGROUND

Why Albion?


As an alumnus of Albion College, I learned the importance of art in the lives of people, having had my own relationship with music fostered and nurtured through my various teachers. I also learned how vital ""community"" is to art and its creation. (Nothing is created in a vacuum.)
Albion, MI, has had a long and diverse relationship with music through the years; Albion College was once a piano conservatory for women in the late 19th century, a many notable jazz and blues artists claim Albion as their birthplace. As a factory town, however, Albion saw diminishing economic opportunities as the factories closed over time.
Since those closures the town has sought to revitalize itself by reconnecting with its artistic past. The local residents, businesses, and college have all worked diligently to foster a community of diversity and inclusion, with music being central to that cause.
I want to be a part of that revitalization, to contribute to a community that has given so much, and to connect (and reconnect) with my own artistic truth.

Why the Bohm Theater?


Central to Albion's renaissance has been the restoration of its old movie theater, the Bohm. Dating back to the silent film era, the Bohm theater stands tall in Albion's city center. With a large stage and gorgeous balcony--even the original organ used for accompanying silent films is still intact--the Bohm has fantastic acoustics , making it the perfect venue for both a concert and live recording. But that is only part of the story.

Why a live album recording?
The answer to this question will take a little longer to explain, but it's worth the time.
In 2017 we released the album “Dance with the Devil.”   Since live performances are an integral part of the ensemble’s identity, I conceived of an album that would ultimately be a live recording of a music concert, hoping to capture the energy created between the audience and the musicians. In April of that year, we successfully recorded 10 compositions—two of which were tributes to the late “Duke” Ellington—featuring a full jazz big band augmented with violin, tuba, banjo, and vibraphone, before a sold-out crowd of 224 people at Detroit’s historic Scarab Club, a gallery and artist space behind the Detroit Institute of Arts. The excitement and energy of both audience and ensemble was palpable, and the recording itself captured every bit of that energy. In 2018, much to the delight (and surprise) of all involved, “Dance with the Devil” won a Detroit Music Award for outstanding jazz recording. 

That evening is still talked about by our fans, as is the record itself, a favorite of many music critics, including Ann Delisi of WDET, Linda Yohn at WEMU, and the staff at WRCJ (Detroit), WBEZ (Chicago), WWOZ (New Orleans), and WNYC (NYC).

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>BEAT-LELE is comprised of four musician friends on the island of Oahu, Hawaii who've been playing Beatles music together for ten years. In recent years they decided to do something never quite done before; singing and performing Beatles music as ""John"", ""Paul"", ""George"" and ""Ringo"" (without the costumes and wigs) solely on UKULELE and a Cajon. </p>
<p>Once their debut single of ""If I Fell"" hit Youtube in 2017, they were invited to Liverpool, England to perform in the most prestigious of Beatles Festivals in the world at International Beatle Week where they performed for thousands over the course of a week, including the famous Cavern Club where the Beatles themselves played early in their career. They were subsequently invited to perform at various clubs, theatres and ukulele festivals and private events.</p>
<p>Thanks to a successful Indiegogo campaign in 2017, BEAT-LELE was able to record their debut self-titled album which won critical acclaim and had them nominated for two Na Hoku Hanohano Awards (Hawaii's Grammy equivalent) for Most Promising Artist of 2018 and Favorite Entertainers of the Year. Co-produced and engineered by Grammy award winning Producer/Engineer Dave Tucciarone, BEAT-LELE will be ready to record this second album with Dave once again and deliver a high quality, professional studio album.</p>
<p>People of all ages and backgrounds appreciate what we do because the music is familiar, but heard in a way that is unique while still retaining the essence of the original recordings. It is this combination that intrigues the listener while giving them joy and that feeling that everything will be ok and life is wonderful! </p>
<p>Simply put, this is why we do what we do. It gives us such a high to bring about joy in other people through this great music and humble instruments of ukulele's and cajon. This troubled world of ours needs more peace and love and hearing this music will hopefully inspire each person to take that to heart and live that message. Your contribution will help continue our desire to bring a little more love to the world. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Though BEAT-LELE has achieved some accolades in the last few years, we still have our day jobs and BEAT-LELE is very much a labor of love. It takes a lot to produce an album of this quality so we are in need of $18,000 to record this next album. First off, when working with a two-time Grammy winning and 15 time Na Hoku Award winning producer/engineer like Dave Tucciarone who has worked with practically everyone and anyone in Hawaiian music, you know the result will be amazing.</p>
<p>With the challenging songs we are going to be taking on, it is estimated our time in the studio will be almost DOUBLE what is was for our first album. In addition, there's mixing, mastering and creating, replicating and printing the packaging for the CD and promotion costs. Recording Beatle songs means we also have to register them and pay royalties. We are also providing high quality PERKS for our contributors so those costs are deducted from what is grossed. From digital downloads to custom BEAT-LELE guitar picks, personally autographed CD's, BEAT-LELE T-Shirts, Kani'lea ukulele's to having us perform at your private party, we are going to PERK YOU UP!</p>
<p>This is how it breaks down:</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This second BEAT-LELE album will far exceed what we did on our first. Instrumentally and vocally, we are raising the BEAT-LELE bar high as we always seek to challenge ourselves, re-creating the sounds of these original Beatle recordings in a way people didn't think possible on ukulele's. This will result in an album that is unlike any other. It will be more than an ukulele album, more than a Beatles tribute album; it will be BEAT-LELE!</p>
<p>Our reach is global and we want to continue to bring this unique rendition of The Beatles music across the universe where people around the world are finding fascination with Hawaii's instrument, the Ukulele. You have an opportunity to be a big part of that</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
BEAT-LELE is comprised of four musician friends on the island of Oahu, Hawaii who've been playing Beatles music together for ten years. In recent years they decided to do something never quite done before; singing and performing Beatles music as ""John"", ""Paul"", ""George"" and ""Ringo"" (without the costumes and wigs) solely on UKULELE and a Cajon. 
Once their debut single of ""If I Fell"" hit Youtube in 2017, they were invited to Liverpool, England to perform in the most prestigious of Beatles Festivals in the world at International Beatle Week where they performed for thousands over the course of a week, including the famous Cavern Club where the Beatles themselves played early in their career. They were subsequently invited to perform at various clubs, theatres and ukulele festivals and private events.
Thanks to a successful Indiegogo campaign in 2017, BEAT-LELE was able to record their debut self-titled album which won critical acclaim and had them nominated for two Na Hoku Hanohano Awards (Hawaii's Grammy equivalent) for Most Promising Artist of 2018 and Favorite Entertainers of the Year. Co-produced and engineered by Grammy award winning Producer/Engineer Dave Tucciarone, BEAT-LELE will be ready to record this second album with Dave once again and deliver a high quality, professional studio album.
People of all ages and backgrounds appreciate what we do because the music is familiar, but heard in a way that is unique while still retaining the essence of the original recordings. It is this combination that intrigues the listener while giving them joy and that feeling that everything will be ok and life is wonderful! 
Simply put, this is why we do what we do. It gives us such a high to bring about joy in other people through this great music and humble instruments of ukulele's and cajon. This troubled world of ours needs more peace and love and hearing this music will hopefully inspire each person to take that to heart and live that message. Your contribution will help continue our desire to bring a little more love to the world. 
 

What We Need & What You Get
Though BEAT-LELE has achieved some accolades in the last few years, we still have our day jobs and BEAT-LELE is very much a labor of love. It takes a lot to produce an album of this quality so we are in need of $18,000 to record this next album. First off, when working with a two-time Grammy winning and 15 time Na Hoku Award winning producer/engineer like Dave Tucciarone who has worked with practically everyone and anyone in Hawaiian music, you know the result will be amazing.
With the challenging songs we are going to be taking on, it is estimated our time in the studio will be almost DOUBLE what is was for our first album. In addition, there's mixing, mastering and creating, replicating and printing the packaging for the CD and promotion costs. Recording Beatle songs means we also have to register them and pay royalties. We are also providing high quality PERKS for our contributors so those costs are deducted from what is grossed. From digital downloads to custom BEAT-LELE guitar picks, personally autographed CD's, BEAT-LELE T-Shirts, Kani'lea ukulele's to having us perform at your private party, we are going to PERK YOU UP!
This is how it breaks down:
$10,500 - recording costs
$1,500 - mixing/mastering
$1,200 - CD artwork/design/packaging
1,500 - marketing/promotion (campaign/CD)
$900 - Indiegogo fees
$450 - Royalty fees
$1,850 - Perk costs
$100 - celebratory bottle of champagne when the recording is finalized! : )

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Kenny Ngo. I am a Catholic singer-songwriter, and have been serving the church and its ministries for over 30 years now.</p>
<p>This campaign aims to raise funds for the production of a Christmas album for this year in lieu of the Covid-19 situation, and it's incredibly important to me in how I can be helping the churches I serve, by raising funds for them through this project, as well as support other incredibly talented creatives in my field.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I will be re-arranging some classic Christmas songs, as well as releasing some of my own originals, of which the instrumentation and recording my own parts are done. I'm enlisting the services of an engineer who will be mixing and mastering my tracks, as well as recording some additional vocal parts of a few talented singers that I've engaged as well.<br/><br/>The cost of the album will be as follows:<br/>1) 14 songs x $600 each = $8,400<br/>2) 3 singers x $600 each = $1,800<br/>3) CD production (based on 3 different quotes with different standards, it can range from $2,250 to $4,050)<br/>Total cost ~ $12,500 - $14,500<br/><br/>How you can support this project:</p>
<p><u><strong>Tier 1 ($20)</strong></u></p>
<p>Pre-order a Christmas album at just $20. The package will be a CD, plus a QR code embedded in the album. This will allow for direct download, or scanning into your devices for your listening pleasure.</p>
<p><u><strong>Tier 2 ($50)</strong></u></p>
<p>Pre-order a Christmas album at just $20. The package will be a CD, plus a QR code embedded in the album. This will allow for direct download, or scanning into your devices for your listening pleasure.</p>
<p>AND</p>
<p><u>An online concert</u> to be held over Zoom, on<br/><strong>Saturday, 12th December, 20:00 PM [GMT + 8 (Singapore Time), </strong><br/>with the link being provided to the donors of this tier once the necessary logistics are in place.</p>
<p><u><strong>Tier 3 ($90)</strong></u><br/>Tier 1 + Tier 2</p>
<p>AND</p>
<p><u>3 online sessions</u> on tips on songwriting will be offered, with the dates being published to the donors of this tier once the necessary logistics are in place. These online sessions can also be gifted to others to attend if the donor is unable to do so.</p>
<p><u><strong>Tier 4 ($120)</strong></u></p>
<p>Tier 1 + Tier 2</p>
<p>AND</p>
<p><u>3 online sessions</u> on my secrets to pop and jazz piano playing. This will be a part-demonstration, part-hands-on workshop. Dates will be published to the donors of this tier once the necessary logistics are in place. These online sessions can also be gifted to others to attend if the donor is unable to do so.</p>
<h3>Where will the funds go?</h3>
<p>The goal to reach to cover the minimum cost will be $15,000, and for each and every dollar of support, 80% goes to the churches below of your choosing! If the funds do not reach the entire goal, we will still strive to sell more CDs of which, 80% will still go to the churches, and the 20% will go into covering costs. The church that we are primarily supporting is</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.sfxchurch.sg/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Church of St. Francis Xavier</a><br/><a href=""https://www.stbernadette.org.sg/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">​</a></p>
<p>However, you can support us and donate the proceeds to your own church that you specify. Please do so against your name. For example, Kenneth Ngo (Church of St Alphonsus). </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The year 2020 has been one we will always remember in our lifetime. The extraordinary challenges we faced; how we had to be creative and innovative to remain connected, and how we could still make a difference in each other’s lives without being physically connected.</p>
<p>Although we are now able to meet up in small groups and reconnect, there is now the dilemma of who to invite, where to meet conveniently, and still maintaining our social distance. Music, particularly singing, is still prohibited. The new normal has seriously affected what we are used to. No church choir singing, no live performances, no jamming in a pub, no karaoke, etc.</p>
<p>It's tough to imagine what Christmas 2020 will be like. Unless by some miracle this coronavirus goes away, we will not be able to sing Christmas carols in church, or have choirs and groups doing carolling in homes, shopping malls, and churches to bring Yuletide cheer to others.</p>
<p>However, it is not all that bad. Our current situation creates opportunities for us to give back to society, and to make a difference in each other’s lives. During the circuit breaker, I was inspired to create short music videos, and sing positive songs to encourage all of us to keep going and be positive during the circuit breaker. I tried to bring Easter cheer to everyone by creating a radio prayer concert, that was aired twice on CatholicSG Radio. I received very encouraging feedback from the listeners, and they said that it helped make Easter special and joyful, thanks to the music they could access.</p>
<p>The churches I've worked with have also been extremely supportive of my endeavors, and while the priests and pastors have not openly expressed their plight, it is evident that they do face a lot of stress trying to keep the church running, and being able to pay their full-time church staff.</p>
<p>Therefore, I  am humbly asking for your kind and generous spirit, to donate to this fundraiser. By pre-ordering a Christmas album,  you will help alleviate the financial burden of the churches.  I aim to make this Christmas a Christmas to remember, not just for the many people that will be involved in this project, but I also hope it will be an unforgettable Christmas for you, not just by the music, but also by your generous giving.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Given that it's already in October, and I intend to release the album on the 4th of December, that gives me less than 2 months to get everything ready. However, I've planned for the tracklist, as stated below, and I'm toiling every night to make sure that the arrangements are coming out, to give enough time for the recording, mixing and mastering process.</p>
<p>I'm aiming for a target of 2 songs to be completed every week, which gives me just about enough time for the album.</p>
<p>The tracklist as follows:</p>
<p><u>CHRISTMAS ALBUM 2020 SONGLIST</u><br/>1.     <strong>CHRISTMAS OVERTURE</strong><br/>2.    <strong>O COME O COME EMMANUEL</strong><br/>3.    <strong>O COME ALL YE FAITHFUL</strong> <i>(quartet of Joyce Ang, David Lee, Denise Dumont and Kenny Ngo)</i><br/>4.    <strong>SILENT NIGHT</strong> (duet with Father Kamil Kamus)<br/>5.    <strong>CHILDREN OF THE WORLD</strong> <i>(duet with Joyce Ang)</i><br/>6.    <strong>GIVE A LITTLE LOVE (TO THE CHILDREN)</strong> <i>(duet with Charles Ang)</i><br/>7.    <strong>CHRISTMAS ISN’T CHRISTMAS</strong><br/>8.    <strong>O HOLY NIGHT</strong> <i>(duet with Father Kamil Kamus)</i><br/>9.    <strong>THE BIRTHDAY OF A KING </strong>(featuring Claris Ang)<br/>10.  <strong>ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS</strong><br/>11. <strong>GOD REST YE MERRY GENTLEMEN</strong><br/>12. <strong>AVE MARIA </strong>(Schubert)<br/>13. <strong>THE WONDER OF THIS NIGHT</strong> <i>(trio of Trevor Nerva, Charles Ang and Kenny Ngo)</i><br/>14. <strong>GLORIA</strong> <strong>(MASS OF THE QUEEN OF PEACE)</strong> <i>(Quintet of Joyce Ang, David Lee, Denise Dumont, Charles Ang and Kenny Ngo)</i></p>

<p>1. I must thank our Heavenly Father for gifting us the baby Jesus, for which we celebrate his birthday year after year. We celebrate not just the festive spirit, but the true salvation that is promised us because God loved us that much, that He gave His only Son to save us all. I only hope this album is a prayer of gratitude for the gifts You, O God, bestow on all of us.</p>
<p>2. I am indebted to a few people who generously funded this project in big amounts. Special thanks go to Florence Cheong Ngo, who did not hesitate to open her chequebook, Christina Lien for her huge donation on Indiegogo, and also to Frank and Nancy Yung for their kind donation to the cause. I am also grateful to all of you people who pitched your money to this Indiegogo campaign and raised the money we needed to not only fund the project but to be able to gift to the church as well. THANK YOU SOOOO MUCH! May God bless you all for your generosity!</p>
<p>3. It was amazing working with my musical partner-in-crime, Charles Ang. This talented man transformed all my musical instruments and turned them into real-sounding instruments that would have sounded like the Berlin Philharmonic was backing me up on all these tracks you hear. Charles’ initiative on adding more layers to my musical arrangement was a testament to his desire for perfection and commitment to his craft. Charles, this album is as much yours as it is mine. I hope this collaboration will be one of many from here on.</p>
<p>4. I am also grateful to my team of singers who immediately said yes, and believed so much in this project. They were amazing and patient and gave their heart and soul to this CD. When you hear their voices, I hope you will agree with me. Fr Kamil Kamus, Joyce Ang, David Lee, Denise Dumont, Trevor Nerva, and Charles Ang, THANK YOU SOOOO MUCH!</p>
<p>5. My business partners, Chia Kun Loong and Jace Koh, of Opus Management Pte Ltd, for always working behind the scenes, researching and networking tirelessly, and making honest suggestions to improve the album.</p>
<p>6. Last but not least, to my wife, Anna, and stepchildren who always support what I do.<br/>I am lucky to be able to do what I do without being distracted by family life.<br/>THANK YOU and LOVE YOU ALL!</p>

If the funds do not reach the entire goal, we will still strive to sell more CDs of which, 80% will still go to the churches, and the 20% will go into covering costs. The church that we are primarily supporting is
Church of St. Francis Xavier​
However, you can support us and donate the proceeds to your own church that you specify. Please do so against your name. For example, Kenneth Ngo (Church of St Alphonsus). 

The Impact
The year 2020 has been one we will always remember in our lifetime. The extraordinary challenges we faced; how we had to be creative and innovative to remain connected, and how we could still make a difference in each other’s lives without being physically connected.
Although we are now able to meet up in small groups and reconnect, there is now the dilemma of who to invite, where to meet conveniently, and still maintaining our social distance. Music, particularly singing, is still prohibited. The new normal has seriously affected what we are used to. No church choir singing, no live performances, no jamming in a pub, no karaoke, etc.
It's tough to imagine what Christmas 2020 will be like. Unless by some miracle this coronavirus goes away, we will not be able to sing Christmas carols in church, or have choirs and groups doing carolling in homes, shopping malls, and churches to bring Yuletide cheer to others.
However, it is not all that bad. Our current situation creates opportunities for us to give back to society, and to make a difference in each other’s lives. During the circuit breaker, I was inspired to create short music videos, and sing positive songs to encourage all of us to keep going and be positive during the circuit breaker. I tried to bring Easter cheer to everyone by creating a radio prayer concert, that was aired twice on CatholicSG Radio. I received very encouraging feedback from the listeners, and they said that it helped make Easter special and joyful, thanks to the music they could access.
The churches I've worked with have also been extremely supportive of my endeavors, and while the priests and pastors have not openly expressed their plight, it is evident that they do face a lot of stress trying to keep the church running, and being able to pay their full-time church staff.
Therefore, I  am humbly asking for your kind and generous spirit, to donate to this fundraiser. By pre-ordering a Christmas album,  you will help alleviate the financial burden of the churches.  I aim to make this Christmas a Christmas to remember, not just for the many people that will be involved in this project, but I also hope it will be an unforgettable Christmas for you, not just by the music, but also by your generous giving.

Risks & Challenges
Given that it's already in October, and I intend to release the album on the 4th of December, that gives me less than 2 months to get everything ready. However, I've planned for the tracklist, as stated below, and I'm toiling every night to make sure that the arrangements are coming out, to give enough time for the recording, mixing and mastering process.
I'm aiming for a target of 2 songs to be completed every week, which gives me just about enough time for the album.
The tracklist as follows:
CHRISTMAS ALBUM 2020 SONGLIST1.     CHRISTMAS OVERTURE2.    O COME O COME EMMANUEL3.    O COME ALL YE FAITHFUL (quartet of Joyce Ang, David Lee, Denise Dumont and Kenny Ngo)4.    SILENT NIGHT (duet with Father Kamil Kamus)5.    CHILDREN OF THE WORLD (duet with Joyce Ang)6.    GIVE A LITTLE LOVE (TO THE CHILDREN) (duet with Charles Ang)7.    CHRISTMAS ISN’T CHRISTMAS8.    O HOLY NIGHT (duet with Father Kamil Kamus)9.    THE BIRTHDAY OF A KING (featuring Claris Ang)10.  ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS11.

1. I must thank our Heavenly Father for gifting us the baby Jesus, for which we celebrate his birthday year after year. We celebrate not just the festive spirit, but the true salvation that is promised us because God loved us that much, that He gave His only Son to save us all. I only hope this album is a prayer of gratitude for the gifts You, O God, bestow on all of us.
2. I am indebted to a few people who generously funded this project in big amounts. Special thanks go to Florence Cheong Ngo, who did not hesitate to open her chequebook, Christina Lien for her huge donation on Indiegogo, and also to Frank and Nancy Yung for their kind donation to the cause. I am also grateful to all of you people who pitched your money to this Indiegogo campaign and raised the money we needed to not only fund the project but to be able to gift to the church as well. THANK YOU SOOOO MUCH! May God bless you all for your generosity!
3. It was amazing working with my musical partner-in-crime, Charles Ang. This talented man transformed all my musical instruments and turned them into real-sounding instruments that would have sounded like the Berlin Philharmonic was backing me up on all these tracks you hear. Charles’ initiative on adding more layers to my musical arrangement was a testament to his desire for perfection and commitment to his craft. Charles, this album is as much yours as it is mine. I hope this collaboration will be one of many from here on.
4. I am also grateful to my team of singers who immediately said yes, and believed so much in this project. They were amazing and patient and gave their heart and soul to this CD. When you hear their voices, I hope you will agree with me. Fr Kamil Kamus, Joyce Ang, David Lee, Denise Dumont, Trevor Nerva, and Charles Ang, THANK YOU SOOOO MUCH!
5. My business partners, Chia Kun Loong and Jace Koh, of Opus Management Pte Ltd, for always working behind the scenes, researching and networking tirelessly, and making honest suggestions to improve the album.
6. Last but not least, to my wife, Anna, and stepchildren who always support what I do.I am lucky to be able to do what I do without being distracted by family life.THANK YOU and LOVE YOU ALL!

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>Hi folks! </p>
<p>   To all newcomers, my name is Joe Edwards and I'm here to ask for help towards something dear to many of our hearts, a van! In fact a band van to be exact. In December last year my brother and I flew from London to Nashville to meet with multi award winning musician and producer Steve Dawson to record my debut album 'Keep On Running'. The album, which contains 11 original tracks in roots forms from Americana to blues is to be released on April 24th. </p>
<p>   In the build up to the recording, I was working 3 different jobs in an effort to fund the project independently. Heading to Nashville was only on the itinerary after reading up linear notes of some of my favourite albums, which is where I found producer Steve, and not being an expected part of the budget means I now need a little extra help getting it across the line.</p>
<p>   Contributions will serve as a substantial aid in quite literally getting the show on the road. Having a van will enable us the freedom to tour, promote the album, reach a wider audience and ultimately help see those years of hard graft in to fruition and give the best chance possible in carving out a living in something I love. </p>
<h2>What We Need</h2>
<p>To be as transparent as possible, I've listed exactly where the funds will be going. First up</p>
<p>Van - £3000 - this will help us achieve a van around 10 years old, with mileage ranging from 100k - 150k and will comfortably carry 6 passengers in a factory fitted crew van with room for transporting a pa system and instruments. </p>
<p>Insurance - £1200 - taken from actual quotes, this will cover us for travel in both the UK and Europe, fully comp and under 'business related' use.</p>
<p>Service - £200 - to help give the hog the best chance of survival!</p>
<p>Road Tax - £140 - for a Euro 4 compliant van</p>
<p>M.O.T - £60 - assuming it will need one before the first tour</p>
<p>Repairs - £250 - assuming as with any new purchase, it'll have it's 'quirks'</p>
<p>Roof bars and roof box - £300 - to increase space for carrying merchandise, music equipment and potentially musicians</p>
<p>Steering lock - £30 - Lots of music equipment inside that'll need help protecting</p>
<p>Service charges - £520 - indiegogo take 5% commission plus there's a 2.9% + 30pence per transaction charge</p>
<p>In all that'll get us to £5700 to achieve our goal! Any additional contributions will of course be of great help to and will always be a direct enabler of this album including physical pressings on both cd and vinyl, a small budget for a pr campaign to help the music be heard, rehearsal space as well as a few small musical equipment items left remaining. On the other hand, if we don't reach our goal, you'll still receive your perks and the money will be used to cover as much of the campaign as it possibly can.</p>
<h2>What You Get</h2>
<p>We have a total of 16 different perks available ranging from a copy of the album on your desired format, tickets to the album launch show, a 1 to 1 video call to spend time answering questions on your very own camper build, travel and eco friendly t-shirts, private concerts and even a ride on our ever reliable vintage moped, featured in the music video for 'Keep On Running', all starting from just £8.</p>
<p>If you're new to crowdfunding campaigns, your order will act much in the same way any other purchase would except all funds will be directly invested into future touring and sustainability. To read up in more detail on the perks available, simply scroll through the panels on the right hand side to see more. </p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>As previously mentioned, having a van of my own will enable many more possibilities. In the industry's current climate it is becoming ever more important to focus on live performance revenues as musicians face a decade of decreasing album sales. Utilising a van of my own I can overcome the high rental costs of a band van that startup musicians simply can't afford, seizing the opportunity to get from A to B, making a living as a performing musician. Coming from a fairly 'niche' genre here in the UK, it's also important to venture in to other territories to enable a busy working calendar. This will also give myself and other musicians that join me the opportunity to venture in to Europe and comprehend a sustainable income, making the prospect of touring a viable, longer term endeavour. Ultimately though, it will enable us to get to our audience, engage with music and hopefully share that passion.</p>
<p>So far as a musician, after graduating from the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts, I covered various corners of the world, holding residence in a number of hotels and cruise ships. It was after touring Europe as part of a backing band I realised my ultimate goal, to be able to record and perform my own music. So here I am now, after working 60 hour weeks, writing my own music, making it over to Nashville, setting up my own self releasing label, learning how to and creating music videos, practising day to day, keeping accounts, organising release dates, concerts and pr contacts as well as writing reviews for upcoming musicians at Americana UK on a voluntary basis. Any help in seeing this to fruition will be of great appreciation, not just for me but also in helping other musicians gain valuable work and experience touring and being able to share music with others. </p>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>If you can't contribute right now, I completely understand. You can still be of great help though by sharing the link to this page to someone who might dig it! </p>
<p>Thank you for your time everyone and upmost gratitude to you all. Hopefully we'll meet somewhere along the way but for now,</p>
<p>All the best,</p>
<p>Joe</p>

<h2><strong>Our Story</strong></h2>
<p>Oh My Ears (OME) is a fiscally-sponsored new music presenting non-profit in Phoenix, AZ that connects emerging composers, ensembles, and musicians with each other and with the greater Phoenix community. Founded in 2014 by composer Elizabeth Kennedy Bayer, Oh My Ears has grown from a single annual concert to include multiple year-round programs and an annual four-day New Music Festival. OME's primary programming focus is to facilitate the performance and creation of what we call “experiential music.” We take music out of traditional concert settings and into art galleries, bars, and nature preserves. We collaborate with dancers, slam poets, and multi-sensory performers. <br/><br/>OME is a grassroots organization run by a team of local musicians and composers who are passionate about building a thriving New Music scene in the state of Arizona. We are DIY in every sense of the word. Every position on our admin team is currently a volunteer position. We are responsible for every step in the process of creating our concerts and events, from selecting performers and booking venues, to running sound and lights and manning the ticket booth the day of the show. While we have expanded significantly over the past 6 years in terms of programming and the size of our team, we are still seeking funding to become an independent nonprofit which will increase our grant opportunities and allow us to seek corporate sponsorships. <br/><br/><strong>We need your help to keep doing what we do, and to reach our goals of presenting even more new music, paying our performers more, and to (finally) pay our administrative team!</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $3,000 to become our own, independent nonprofit. This money will go towards paying the right people to do our paperwork correctly and any financial or legal help we will need along the way. </p>
<p>With our own non-profit status, OME will be able to apply for more grants, apply for currently available grants in a more streamlined fashion with no cut from a fiscal sponsor (currently 8%), we will be more available to individual donors, and we can create more beneficial relationships with local business in the ways of sponsorships and fund donations. </p>
<p>Oh My Ears is currently producing over 40 concerts and events alongside our annual multi-day new music festival. The new music community in Phoenix has grown exponentially over the past seven years since we began. If we are able to gain our 501(c)3 status our impact of presenting concerts, paying performers, growing our audience, and providing a space for creative music making in Arizona will take off in a big way. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Impact on OME</h3>
<p>The first impact we will feel from gaining independent nonprofit status is financial. With increased access to tools that are free to use for nonprofits, we will see an immediate increase in artist pay, time reduction for administration (we move most work to Salesforce vs. Google Drive), and the ability to serve artists and audience in a complete way (think updating mailing lists, better donor communication, etc.). We will have access to the following services for free or at a discount (we do not have access now): </p>
<ul>
<li>Google Office Suite (currently $12/month) </li>
<li>SalesForce</li>
<li>50% discount on Buffer Pro (social media management software)</li>
<li>Canva Work (online design tool)</li>
<li>DocuSign Standard (30% discount) </li>
<li>Tax-deductible donations for donors on multiple platforms </li>
<li>Lower bank fees (currently $14/month)</li>
<li>Free web hosting with DreamHost (currently $120/year) </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Impact on the Community</h3>
<p>Since OME began in 2013, we have paid artists over $15,000 to perform creative and experimental music in Arizona. As a lump sum that sounds nice, but spread over hundreds of artists, it is very little. It has always been our aim to pay performing musicians at least $150 per hour (union standard). We believe that performing and creating works that are essentially the R&amp;D music should pay enough to help musicians sustain themselves. As we grow, we would also like to implement grants and residency programs for creative music making. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<li>Volunteer</li>
<li>Become a Patron for as little as $1/mo  (patreon.com/ohmyears)</li>
<li>Share this campaign on social media </li>

If we are able to gain our 501(c)3 status our impact of presenting concerts, paying performers, growing our audience, and providing a space for creative music making in Arizona will take off in a big way. 

Impact on OME
The first impact we will feel from gaining independent nonprofit status is financial. With increased access to tools that are free to use for nonprofits, we will see an immediate increase in artist pay, time reduction for administration (we move most work to Salesforce vs. Google Drive), and the ability to serve artists and audience in a complete way (think updating mailing lists, better donor communication, etc.). We will have access to the following services for free or at a discount (we do not have access now): 

Google Office Suite (currently $12/month) 
SalesForce
50% discount on Buffer Pro (social media management software)
Canva Work (online design tool)
DocuSign Standard (30% discount) 
Tax-deductible donations for donors on multiple platforms 
Lower bank fees (currently $14/month)
Free web hosting with DreamHost (currently $120/year) 


Impact on the Community
Since OME began in 2013, we have paid artists over $15,000 to perform creative and experimental music in Arizona. As a lump sum that sounds nice, but spread over hundreds of artists, it is very little. It has always been our aim to pay performing musicians at least $150 per hour (union standard). We believe that performing and creating works that are essentially the R&D music should pay enough to help musicians sustain themselves. As we grow, we would also like to implement grants and residency programs for creative music making.

Music and worship have always been a huge part of who we are as individuals and as a married couple. We began leading worship together in middle school and it has continued to be a primary way we use our gifts in ministry today. Several years ago, we recorded our first 6-song EP (Resound, 2011), and a couple years ago released a single (Throw Open the Doors, 2016), and now we finally have the opportunity to make this full-length album dream a reality!</p><h3>Where We're At Right Now</h3><p>As we are launching this campaign, we already have the songwriting for this album complete and are releasing a single ""Gave Your Life"" to give you a taste of what's to come on the rest of the album (see lyric video above)! The content is there, now we are preparing to take the bones of these songs and turn them into beautiful finished creative works available for you to hear and worship with! In the coming weeks we will meet with our producer to finalize the tracking, then as the funds are raised we will finally get the instruments and vocals tracked, followed by mixing and mastering. While there is still much to do, having the songs ready to go gives us great excitement and hope for completing what we have started.</p><h3>How You Can Help</h3><p>We are leaning on you to help us make this vision a reality. Our goal is to raise $10,000 to cover the cost of this album. You can check out the many funding options available, and if you're excited about our new music, you can give at whatever level you feel led.

<h3>Pariah: songs of the outcasts</h3>
<p><i>I have the vision to bring you a 10 song concept album, with every song inspired by a biblical person in a time of their life when they were an outcast.</i></p>
<p>Do you want to hear the songs of Joseph, Leah, Job, Zaccheaus, and King David? Each song will strive to minister to and encourage listeners who may find themselves in similar life situations. There is peace and redemption in the midst of isolation: we are not alone when God is with us.</p>
<p>As a truly independent artist, I am looking to you as my friends and fans to partner with me to bring this album to life. Without your support, this project cannot happen.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How you can partner &amp; What you get in return</h3>
<p><u>I have already self-funded and committed 50% of the cost of production of the album. I need to raise $8,000 to finish funding the entire production and post-production</u>. (This includes the hiring of the producer, recording of all the instruments and vocals, and mixing and mastering.)</p>
<p>Anyone contributing $10+ will receive an exclusive early digital download, but I also have some really fun and unique perks for music lovers of all kinds. Check out perks on the right hand side of the page that are available ONLY to backers of this campaign. <u>Any amount of support helps!</u></p>
<p>Even if we do not reach the goal,<u> all funds raised will still go towards the album production</u>. (but the sooner we can raise the funds, the sooner I can bring you this new music!)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why an album about outcasts?</h3>
<p><i>As a faith-based artist, I am always looking to scripture for inspiration to bring glory to God and to encourage his people through music, even if the project is unique and specific. </i></p>
<p>This project will be able to reach out to people in unique times of personal challenges. Financial struggles, stress, loneliness, rejection...and speak the truth of God's faithfulness in times of trouble.</p>
<p>This will be my fifth full length album and my second full length concept album. My first concept album, (The Realest Thing: a concept album on Christian apologetics) continues to reach out to people in a unique search for music that ministers to their faith journey. I hope the same will be true for this project! I have also had the opportunity to collaborate with many talented faith-based songwriters to bring you the songs on this new album. I cannot wait to share with you a project that has been shaped and influenced by other talented writer/artists such as Caroline Cobb, Paul Demer, Meg Ammons, David Gentiles, Cedric Isreal and Delaney Ramsdell.</p>
<p>As an independent musician, what God puts on my heart is more important to me than what is ""radio friendly"" for my brand. <u>Choosing to remain independent (not funded by a record label) gives me the freedom to follow wherever God leads me, without having to worry about changing the music to meet a bottom line. This is why I need partners like you who believe in what I'm doing and are ready to help me make it happen!</u></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Timeline and Details</h3>
<p>I've already begun pre-production on the project (sending in demos of all the songs to the producer) and we will be recording all instruments and vocals through spring/summer of this year (2020). The goal is to have all your perks in hand by early 2021 and an official release date for ""Pariah"" in April 2021.</p>
<p>I'll be working with Chad Carouthers of The Sleep Well studio in Nashville, TN. Chad is a multi-instrumentalist and producer and he will be able to do the recording work entirely himself (with the exception of my vocals!)  Working with someone as capable and talented as Chad allows me to be able to afford to bring you an entire album of 10 songs (which would probably not be possible if I was paying individual players and booking many days of studio time) Chad produced my 2017 project The Realest Thing, so be sure to go check that album out to hear the amazing quality of his work. I'm excited to be working with him again!</p>

The Roots Reggae, Folk, World, Hip-Hop sound fusion that I carry and the connective performances that I deliver never fails to unite and connect audiences and listeners time and time again.</p><p>I am devoted to releasing these songs on a full length studio album that will inspire, uplift, move and enhance the lives of people all around the world.

It would be an incredible thing to witness the community helping to bring this vision into fruition.</p><p>This campaign will allow me to release the album independently, provide the world with a sonic masterpiece and provide me with top notch studio quality material to represent who I am to the world.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564763006/vuib3wdkbvia4zd0bewg.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>Although this self produced album has been in the works for the last two years, it is now at the stage where it is ready to be taken to the big studio and brought to its full potential.

<p>Als wir 2013 &amp; 2014 zum Japanischen Filmfestival eingeladen wurden, konnten wir eine tolle Zeit mit den Leuten in Frankfurt verbringen.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Mic Tienken here. I'm a songwriter that has worked with many very talented musicians over the years.  These people are my my friends and partners in musical endeavors that have literally made my life worth living.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, most of them are out of work so they are doing various projects such as online performances, etc. Many of these people are sidemen for national touring acts, they are not the stars, and they are not making money from the royalties on their back catalogs. There are also lots of touring bands that make most of their money from live gigs and that just can't happen right now, and probably won't for at least another month or two. Maybe more.</p>
<p>Also, I have lost my job due to this unfortunate situation, and although I will be OK for a while, I don't know what the future holds. But what this set of circumstances has done is given me the time to focus on music and songwriting, something I haven't had the luxury of doing in decades.</p>
<p>So what I'm going to do is have some of the best singers, players, and producers I know contribute to a release of my original songs. I don't even plan on singing any of them, I am having singers far better than me sprinkle their special magic on my compositions.<br/><br/>Bottom line... I want to pay them for their time.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h3>Short Summary</h3><p>When the pandemic hit last year, on one hand I saw my fans and friends missing the live music connection and wanting to see my live gigs. On the other hand every tour and gig that we had booked was either cancelled or postponed. “No worries” I said to my band, “lets just get in the studio and make some awesome music for when the pandemic is over”  BUT the truth was we were longing to perform live and connect with my fans live... Without giving it much thought I got my guitar, connected my phone to the 'live' feature on Facebook and just had a party with my fans around the World and it felt like they were sitting in my garage or living room,  asking me to play various songs from my repertoire,  everyone was chatting with me and each other - basically having loads of fun. For around an hour it felt like life was back to normal. I called this one off live stream a “Garage Session”... (because we were jamming in my garage with all my motorbikes) :-)</p><p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Little did I know that my fans were gonna take control of the “Virtual” garage gigs that they were part of LOL. The live streaming gigs soon became the official Garage Sessions gigs, where fans were deciding what songs I would sing, some of the sound savy guys were setting up my sound virtually while i performed, there were girls throwing virtual bras at me (okay I'm kidding now) :-)) but you get the idea :) The garage sessions took on a life of its own that even the even mainstream media started promoting these garage session gigs internationally on major newspapers. </span></p><p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">I dont see these gigs ending any time soon - pandemic or no pandemic. If anything, this pandemic, in a funny way has brought me closer to my REAL FANS. Oh and these garage sessions will always be FREE and will be a priority at least once a month for my real fans around the world. This closeness we have created is only getting stronger.</span></p><p>So to celebrate one year of this amazing community that we have created, I got my band together, booked a major studio, spent a ton of money and recorded a high quality album for the fans. The song's we recorded are a mix of covers and originals that were the top requested songs by the ‘Garage Sessioners’ during the past year in lockdown. We tried to recreate the LIVE feel of the garage sessions on this album, including trying to recreate the various types of garage session gigs that the fans have gotten used to, for example:</p><p>1. The solo shows that I did with just my guitar at the height of the pandemic</p><p>2.

On the other hand every tour and gig that we had booked was either cancelled or postponed. “No worries” I said to my band, “lets just get in the studio and make some awesome music for when the pandemic is over”  BUT the truth was we were longing to perform live and connect with my fans live... Without giving it much thought I got my guitar, connected my phone to the 'live' feature on Facebook and just had a party with my fans around the World and it felt like they were sitting in my garage or living room,  asking me to play various songs from my repertoire,  everyone was chatting with me and each other - basically having loads of fun. For around an hour it felt like life was back to normal. I called this one off live stream a “Garage Session”... (because we were jamming in my garage with all my motorbikes) :-)Little did I know that my fans were gonna take control of the “Virtual” garage gigs that they were part of LOL. The live streaming gigs soon became the official Garage Sessions gigs, where fans were deciding what songs I would sing, some of the sound savy guys were setting up my sound virtually while i performed, there were girls throwing virtual bras at me (okay I'm kidding now) :-)) but you get the idea :) The garage sessions took on a life of its own that even the even mainstream media started promoting these garage session gigs internationally on major newspapers. I dont see these gigs ending any time soon - pandemic or no pandemic. If anything, this pandemic, in a funny way has brought me closer to my REAL FANS. Oh and these garage sessions will always be FREE and will be a priority at least once a month for my real fans around the world. This closeness we have created is only getting stronger.So to celebrate one year of this amazing community that we have created, I got my band together, booked a major studio, spent a ton of money and recorded a high quality album for the fans. The song's we recorded are a mix of covers and originals that were the top requested songs by the ‘Garage Sessioners’ during the past year in lockdown. We tried to recreate the LIVE feel of the garage sessions on this album, including trying to recreate the various types of garage session gigs that the fans have gotten used to, for example:1. The solo shows that I did with just my guitar at the height of the pandemic2. The solo shows with drumming - this is when I upgraded my solo live performances with drums, that I played live via foot stomp units, to give the shows more of 'band' feel.3. The duo gigs- when 1 person could finally visit your home. This is when I invited my bassist to join me for the shows.4. The band gigs - finally when more people could meet outdoors I invited the Oliver Sean Band to join me for the Garage Sessions (with only my drummer sitting in the garage and the rest of us outside the garage performing live).We tried to capture all 4 of these session styles on this album!I also wanted the album to be of the highest quality like my past albums that have hit the mainstream charts. So instead of recording the album in my  garage, I called my friend Angus who owns Farheath Recording studios in Northamton (he has a huge studio where we could all fit in).

Sunrise: A new era for forward thinking music. 
Liminal Divide is
the division between two states.  The music aims to take you somewhere
you've never been before; into a sonic and emotional landscape of unique
experiences.
This
project has taken inspiration from all styles of music; bridging the gap between the
musical and technical. Pulling influences from rock, metal,
jazz, fusion and various world music, Liminal Divide is doing away with the
boundaries of the typical rock/pop definition in favour of an unconstrained musical tapestry.
As the members come from strong & varied musical
backgrounds we understand that the key to good music is that the emotional
message is always served by technicality and never the other way around.


Why fund our music?
 We've put together some music we're really proud of and think you'll love it too. As a group that is less focused on a commercial sound, it is not easy to go through the traditional funding channels and receive radio & TV exposure. We feel that the best way is to reach out directly to music lovers who want to experience something new while making an impact on the music scene of today.
What will we use the funding for?  First and foremost, producing our CD! Including art, printing & packaging (T-shirts and Vinyl too!). Promotion: website, advertising and social media development. Development of stage show including lighting, projection & FX.
Help promote and develop an indie music scene that aims to innovate and push musical boundaries.
   
Releasing Sunrise


Ultimately, we intend to release Sunrise no matter what as we believe in the project. It would be disappointing, but even if we don't reach our total funding goal we'll still send a copy of the album to those of you who contributed.

</h3> <p>I'm so excited to tell you about my  CD campaign. It's one 
that I believe Ive been preparing for most of my singing career. But 
first, a little about me. My name is Denise King. I was born and raised 
in West Philadelphia where I discovered Jazz and Jazz singers at the age
 of about 13. I have 30+ years experience in live performance  and have recorded 6 CD's. I've listened to many, many singers, but my biggest influence was The Divine One, Sarah Vaughan. One of the greatest singers of our time. This campaign is not only a  celebration of her music and her legacy, but my thank you to the singer who impacted me the most and inspired me to sing. <br/></p>
<p><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">On March 6th</a> I will be working with Mark Sarisky Grammy-Nominated engineer and producer with seven Gold and Platinum RIAA Certified productions to his credit, who will capture my live Tribute to Sarah Vaughan performance. Together we will  record the  CD ""Simply Divine"" A Tribute To Sassy Sarah Vaughan. With a rhythm section, horns and strings, we will recreate some of her most memorable and beloved songs and arrangements. <br/></p>
<p> This year to relaunch my solo career, I decided to go back to what i know and love. I knew the 
best way to do that would be to celebrate my hero, ""Sassy"" Sarah Vaughan. 
The Divine One or Sassy contributed so much to the vocal landscape, and with this project I hope to introduce younger singers and more listeners to her music.  Hers is legacy to be remembered, honored and celebrated. One that young and 
older singers can borrow from. I learned so much by listening to her sing. Her phrasing and timing was amazing. She was sometimes in 
time, and sometimes slightly and deliberately behind. It made her one who was 
daring and bold...willing to take chances vocally. Whether she was standing flatfooted at the mic 
telling the sorrow filled tale of Poor Butterfly or gently playing 
the piano while singing Once In A While...she always hit a home 
run. For me...she set the bar. With this project I would like to capture the mood of her music and honor her 
legacy...but I need your help. <br/></p>

</p><p>My name is Tom Szalay. I am a teacher and a photographer, yet I often refer to myself as a visual historian. For the past two decades I have worked as a public high school art teacher in Salt Lake City, Utah. My previous profession as a newspaper photojournalist honed my skills as a documentary photographer and visual storyteller. I have always been interested in learning about different cultures and personalities. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I first met Izidor in 1991, when he came from Romania to San Diego, CA to join his new adoptive family. He was one of thousands of “unsalvageable” kids that the former Romanian Communist dictator, Nicolas Ceauşescu, hid in orphanages. Though these orphanages were called hospitals, they were more like prisons. They were located in small villages, towns, and cities all over Romania. After Ceausescu’s execution in 1989, the world learned of his political policies and discovered this very dark shadow. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In 1992, I went to the Institute for the Unsalvageables, located in Sighetu Marmatiei, Romania, where Izidor was raised. I volunteered to help a humanitarian bring nine “unsalvageable” children to families in America. I also assisted ABC’s news program <i>20/20</i> in filming the story. Two photo essays from this time were published by the <i>San Diego Union</i> newspaper. “Home, At Last” was about Izidor and Isabella’s first year in America. The second, “Salvaging the Unsalvagables,” was about the nine orphans featured in the episode of ABC’s <i>20/20</i>, “Take Me To America,<i>”</i> which aired in 1993.</p>

</p><p>When he turned 21 in 2001, ABC’s <i>20/20 </i>filmed Izidor’s trip back to Romania, where he met his birth family. Since then, Izidor has self-produced a documentary film and done public speaking events for charities. In 2002, Izidor wrote <i>Abandoned for Life</i>, a book about his upbringing. This past year, his story was published by <i>The</i> <i>Washington Post</i>, NPR, and other international media. (to view images, click on the  gallery and links listed below).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Izidor may be Romania’s most notable orphan, but he lives a simple, humble life. He earns his keep as a cashier in a Denver Walmart. He is saving his money in plans for a trip to Romania to see old friends and staff from the orphanage, scheduled in April 2015. This is not just a reunion trip, however. He will deliver talks at different orphanages and advocate to Romanian government officials on behalf of those who were abandoned long ago and still struggle to live. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">He understands their plight.

<h3>Oh, hello.<br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p><b>I'm Howard. </b>My friends have called me
Wood since back when I was in university and I used that name when I
wrote games a few years ago. I have a wife and kids I love more than anything in the world and more friends
than I used to think was possible, and that's a pretty wonderful place to be. I'm lucky.  
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Come September I will have lived in
Swansea</b> for 21 years, more than half my life, and I love this city
dearly. It's my home. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>I write. I make art. </b>And I've been
privileged to work alongside a lot of the many writers and artists
this city has. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>And this September I'm going to be
forty. </b>Which shouldn't be such a big deal, but it feels like the door
into a new part of my life. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>I wanted to mark that with something
big.</b> Or bigger, anyway. I mean, I could have a party, and I like
parties, but I always have a party, and we're at the point where I've
been at this so long that I want to do a different thing. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>So I decided that what I was going to
do was put on a festival. </b>That people could come to and enjoy. My friends, the community. I reckon that I
could organise this just through my friends, but I'm throwing it
public as a venture. 
</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>This Could Be Beautiful <br/>
</h3>
<h3>
</h3>
<p><b>This Could Be Beautiful </b>is
going to run from 25<sup>th</sup>
to 27<sup>th</sup>
September 2015. It will be two full days (the Saturday and Sunday)
and one evening (the Friday), and it'll
be about 15
bands, spoken word artists and small theatre shows, three
on Friday, six on Saturday, six on Sunday.
I might also get in local
artists and merchants, too. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I'm
holding it in Mozarts, Walter Road, Swansea. They agreed to do it for
free as long as they got the bar receipts, so that's good, and I've
confirmed a few people, local and from further afield. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>This is who we've Confirmed:</b></p>
<p><i>Bands:</i></p>
<p><b>Captain
Cat and the Sailors</b> (Swansea's foremost good-time nautical folk party
band, and if I didn't have you at ""good time nautical folk party band"" I have no  hope)</p>
<p><b>The
Understudies</b> (a great band from London)</p>
<p><b>The
Horses of Instruction</b> (another great band from London)</p>
<p><b>Simeon
Smith</b> (musical polymath, AKA Kinetic Monkey and donotrunwithpixels)</p>
<p><b>Alone</b> (electronic genius from Bristol)</p>
<p><b>The Newly Deads</b> (spooky folk rock from Carmarthen)</p>
<p><b>Zeuk</b> (psych folk from Cardiff)</p>
<p><b>DJ Jared</b>  (Swansea decks legend) </p>
<p><b>Jebbers </b>(Swansea acoustic folk)<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i>Theatre
and Spoken Word:</i></p>
<p><b>Mab
Jones</b> (legendary Cardiff performance poet, star of stage and radio)</p>
<p><b>Mark Montinaro  </b>(Laugharne-based stage hero)<br/></p>
<p><b>Clare Ferguson-Walker</b> (scarily accomplished poet-comedienne)<br/></p>
<p><b>Abigail Staniforth</b> (Edinburgh Festival, South Bank)</p>
<b>Richard
Lewis</b> (runner-up in this year's Terry Hetherington Award) <br/><h3></h3>
<p><i></i><b>Atlantis
and Me </b>(that's my show)<br/></p>
<p><i>Also:</i><br/></p>
<p><b>Tabitha
Panter </b>is a great young illustrator and even now, like right now as
you're reading, she's doing the poster graphics and logo designs.
There's a moose and everything.</p>
<p><b>Other people </b>have also offered help and I'm firming up who's doing what right now. <br/>
</p>
<br/><h3>Realistically... <br/>
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Most of these people know me,
</b>yeah, and they're good to agree to take part, but it's important that
they get paid. The Horses and the Understudies, for example, are
coming from London and they're going to need a place to stay and the
hire of vans for their kit. Abi is coming from Southampton.
There's expenses. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>And
besides, this is actually work. I don't want them to do this for
free. </b>I've managed some economies, right (so Mozarts is hosting for
free, and they've got Public Liability Insurance, so that's a thing)
but I've still got to pay a cut of the security fee, and pay the
artists. The only artist not expecting to be paid is me, actually. I
mean, I wouldn't mind a cut, but to be honest, the fact these people
are playing and you paid to see them, and you all had a fabulous time
is the main thing I want to
get out of this. I'm just planning on breaking even. Even if we
somehow manage to raise enough to pay everyone <i>and</i><span>
me, my cut will be no more than anyone else's. That is, the artists
all get an equal cover of any profit. </span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I've
got a full bill planned, and I just need to get those last few people

Oh, hello.
 
I'm Howard. My friends have called me
Wood since back when I was in university and I used that name when I
wrote games a few years ago. I have a wife and kids I love more than anything in the world and more friends
than I used to think was possible, and that's a pretty wonderful place to be. I'm lucky.  



Come September I will have lived in
Swansea for 21 years, more than half my life, and I love this city
dearly. It's my home. 



I write. I make art. And I've been
privileged to work alongside a lot of the many writers and artists
this city has. 



And this September I'm going to be
forty. Which shouldn't be such a big deal, but it feels like the door
into a new part of my life. 



I wanted to mark that with something
big. Or bigger, anyway. I mean, I could have a party, and I like
parties, but I always have a party, and we're at the point where I've
been at this so long that I want to do a different thing. 



So I decided that what I was going to
do was put on a festival. That people could come to and enjoy. My friends, the community. I reckon that I
could organise this just through my friends, but I'm throwing it
public as a venture. 

   This Could Be Beautiful 



This Could Be Beautiful is
going to run from 25th
to 27th
September 2015. It will be two full days (the Saturday and Sunday)
and one evening (the Friday), and it'll
be about 15
bands, spoken word artists and small theatre shows, three
on Friday, six on Saturday, six on Sunday.
I might also get in local
artists and merchants, too. 



I'm
holding it in Mozarts, Walter Road, Swansea. They agreed to do it for
free as long as they got the bar receipts, so that's good, and I've
confirmed a few people, local and from further afield. 





This is who we've Confirmed:
Bands:
Captain
Cat and the Sailors (Swansea's foremost good-time nautical folk party
band, and if I didn't have you at ""good time nautical folk party band"" I have no  hope)
The
Understudies (a great band from London)
The
Horses of Instruction (another great band from London)
Simeon
Smith (musical polymath, AKA Kinetic Monkey and donotrunwithpixels)
Alone (electronic genius from Bristol)
The Newly Deads (spooky folk rock from Carmarthen)
Zeuk (psych folk from Cardiff)
DJ Jared  (Swansea decks legend) 
Jebbers (Swansea acoustic folk)


Theatre
and Spoken Word:
Mab
Jones (legendary Cardiff performance poet, star of stage and radio)
Mark Montinaro  (Laugharne-based stage hero)
Clare Ferguson-Walker (scarily accomplished poet-comedienne)
Abigail Staniforth (Edinburgh Festival, South Bank)
Richard
Lewis (runner-up in this year's Terry Hetherington Award) 
Atlantis
and Me (that's my show)
Also:
Tabitha
Panter is a great young illustrator and even now, like right now as
you're reading, she's doing the poster graphics and logo designs.
There's a moose and everything.
Other people have also offered help and I'm firming up who's doing what right now. 

Realistically... 



Most of these people know me,
yeah, and they're good to agree to take part, but it's important that
they get paid. The Horses and the Understudies, for example, are
coming from London and they're going to need a place to stay and the
hire of vans for their kit. Abi is coming from Southampton.
There's expenses. 



And
besides, this is actually work. I don't want them to do this for
free. I've managed some economies, right (so Mozarts is hosting for
free, and they've got Public Liability Insurance, so that's a thing)
but I've still got to pay a cut of the security fee, and pay the
artists. The only artist not expecting to be paid is me, actually. I
mean, I wouldn't mind a cut, but to be honest, the fact these people
are playing and you paid to see them, and you all had a fabulous time
is the main thing I want to
get out of this. I'm just planning on breaking even. Even if we
somehow manage to raise enough to pay everyone and
me, my cut will be no more than anyone else's. That is, the artists
all get an equal cover of any profit. 



I've
got a full bill planned, and I just need to get those last few people
booked. It's all terribly exciting. 

I need to raise at least five grand, just to make
sure that all the artists are paid for their work, the security people are . And
actually I think that's reasonable. Mozarts can hold just under two
hundred people  at any one time, and what I'm going to do is sell
tickets here, and then if there are any left, sell them at the door.
I'm going to sell the tickets limited here, and we'll see how we go.
Any shortfall we'll make up from the door.  

 
If you contribute
You get tickets. As it stands, I'm going to sell 
up to 100 Friday night tickets at £8 each (it was going to be £7.50 but indiegogo won't let me put up 50p increments); 
up to 100 Saturday tickets at £15 each; 
up to 100 Sunday tickets at £15 each; up to 100 All-weekend tickets at £30 each. Seriously, fifteen quid to see six shows? That's a bargain, that is. That's, um, £2.50 an act.

  This matters
 Because I'm going to be forty. 
But more importantly, I wanted to do a thing here and now that adds to the life of my city, because I love Swansea. Nearly all of the good things in my life started here. I want this to happen.

 When this goes down (and I am saying ""when"" and not ""if"") You might not be able to come. But you might know someone who can! You might be able to offer graphics, or help in other ways? I'd love that.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>Since our first <b>trip to Palestine in 2013</b>, Let Palestine Sing has built up a network of supporting individuals and organisations. Groups like NAWA - The Palestinian Association for Cultural Development - are doing painstaking work to retrace Palestine's musical past. Many musical and cultural resources were stolen by the Israeli occupation, so re-constructing performances and biographies has been an uphill battle. Our links with NAWA and other organisations will help to bring this essential research together and fight for a future where Palestinian musicians are supported and given opportunities to succeed.

                                - Mahmoud Darwish

Let Palestine Sing is a project to research and promote the music of occupied Palestine, building cultural solidarity and supporting the growing international BDS movement. Year 1 of the project included an exclusive interview with Mohammed Assaf at his concert in London, which now has nearly 10,000 views. Our interview helped to promote Assaf's European tour and was the only interview he gave in the UK. In November 2014 Let Palestine Sing helped to bring Palestinian rappers DAM to Europe. Last summer we supported young musicians in Gaza to get video performances out during the Israeli bombing. We have already met and interviewed Palestinian musicians including Assaf, Reem Kelani, Tamer Nafar, Maysa Daw, Reem Talhami, Basel Zayed, Said Murad and Tamer Abu Ghazaleh. Let Palestine Sing has also built strong links with groups and organisations in the West Bank and Gaza. 

Musicians from Palestine are struggling to express their art in the face of Israeli colonisation and ignorance from the global music industry. We make it our duty to promote and support these musicians. Linked to a PhD study at King's College London, the ultimate of aim of Let Palestine Sing is to publish research on music in Palestinian communities and make the music as widely available as possible. In Year 2 we will step up the campaign and develop the world's first online library of Palestinian music. We will fight to give a high profile to the musicians of Palestine by filming videos of performances and interviews, both in Palestine and around the world, making videos available to an international audience.

Let Palestine Sing has the support of important figures in the Palestinian music scene


'
'Considering the intense efforts undertaken by Zionist organizations and politicians to negate and erase the characteristic nature of Palestinian identity, such contributions are vital to the cause of our people. They help consolidate the Palestinian narrative in the face of an Israeli state policy aiming to destroy it. Therefore, those who are sympathetic to the Palestinian cause should do what they can to support Brehony in his valuable scientific research.' 

- Tariq Shadid, Palestinian songwriter also known as Doc Jazz



'Awareness and understanding of the Palestinian cultural heritage has been muted and skewed by a succession of factors: Israeli attempts to erase our existence from history; the difficulties faced by individual researchers, Palestinian or other, of travelling freely and conducting field research around all of historical Palestine and among the Palestinian refugee communities in surrounding countries; efforts by Palestinian factions to harness art to their individual political advantage; and the Orientalist tendencies of the “World Music” industry and some Western writers. [This] fresh eye and proper academic rigour is to be welcomed and supported.'
- Reem Kelani, Palestinian singer, musician and broadcaster



""Music is not a luxurious choice for selected people. It is a rightful practice for everyone who considers it as a possible way of free expression. For many Palestinian artists and musicians, the overlap between social, cultural and political scenes led to music being a tool of manifestation and an exclusive weapon to fight back occupation by preserving the stolen culture and heritage...This project deserves a heartfelt support from all!""

- Basel Zayed, composer and musician living in occupied Jerusalem




""Palestinian musical arts articulate our cultural identity, history, and bear a great deal of our values. The dynamic elements of music forge new positive changes into the world and I am a strong believer that music facilitates these changes, in a subtle and profound ways. Whether through traditional or contemporary musical trends, music helps us understand who we are, and understand the “other,” and the world we live in. While our music tends to shed the light on the human condition, when apprehended, our awareness will help future and past generations in finding ways to achieve justice, enjoy peace, and find their space in history; this is the core of Louis Brehony’s project, which deserves to succeed.""
- Issa Boulos, oud player, composer and Head of Arab Music at Qatar Music Academy

<p>
I've
produced several albums by myself, but this one is different.  It
is the first time I've worked with a producer in a full studio
environment. </p>
<p>
The
album offers 16 tracks, including 5 new instrumentals.  Every track is an original composition, with styles ranging from Celtic to Folk and New Age with an underlying mystical tone.  Each
tune tells a story. There are magical ""come-hithers,""
forest encounters with the wee folk, songs of journeys and of home
and instrumentals that will have your heart dancing.  You might say that some of the tunes were whispered in my ear by the Fairies themselves!</p>

<p>In
the summer of 2014, Brian Henke suggested a fairy themed project
after hearing me play several songs at festivals.  He offered to
produce the album and to add his expertise in bringing the potential
of the music into reality.  He also suggested that I use the same
recording studio where his albums were all made.</p>
<p>
Brian
is one of the top finger-style guitarists of our time and his
recordings have reached all around the world!  I know from hearing
what he has done as a producer for artists like Patrick Woods that he
has an amazing feel for the magic in music!  </p>

<p>
We
are recording at Dark Tree Studios in Cleveland, Ohio, where Brian
has recorded most of his own albums with Jay Bentoff working his
magic at the boards.  I've left every session amazed at the
intuitive touch Jay has for every note!  It is obvious that Jay is a
master musician in his own right and approaches music with that kind of
soul!</p>
<p>Part of the reality of a project like this, time in a quality studio is not an inexpensive item.  On the other hand, I am
more than happy to pay for the wonderful work that Jay and Brian are
accomplishing!  It is definitely a WIN for independent music!</p>

Prior
to this project, I produced 4 albums on my own. I learned to self

I've also created my own original artwork for each project. That
experience is so valuable as I step up into a professional studio
environment!</p>
<p>
All
of my Cd's have a very Celtic feel to them, although you might hear a
bit of gypsy influence here and there.  “It Is Time” and “In
The Old Style” include original and traditional songs and have a
very Celtic feel with my auto-harps and whistles.  “All Earth's
Children” and “Connections” were written with younger audiences
in mind and are being considered for a local arts grant to bring
music to schools and libraries!</p>

Just
the possibility of bringing a project like this to the world as an
independent artist is incredible. Not so long ago, it would have been
impossible outside of a record label. Now, contributors like YOU –
folks that have the heart for real music and art – are making the

<p>
Every

<p>
I
keep folks like Pete Seeger and Judy Collins in mind and let the

other independent artists who challenge me and support what I am
doing!</p>
<p>
Now,
I have YOU to thank for helping make this project a real success that
will be able to reach a much wider audience!  Any support you offer
is deeply appreciated.  If you cannot afford dollars, if you spread

Keep our Mission Truckin’</b></p>
<p>How can a truck help end homelessness? </p>
<p>If you know Virginia Supportive Housing, then you
know that we are the leading supportive housing agency in Virginia. Our mission
is to end homelessness.</p>
<p>Each year, we help more than 1,200 individuals
reclaim their lives. Remarkably, 95% of those we serve do not return to
homelessness. </p>
<p>We cannot do this work alone. Community partners,
philanthropic supporters, government agencies, and volunteers all help to make
homelessness history. </p>
<p><b>Volunteers
in Action</b></p>
<p>We are grateful for the more than 800 volunteers in
Richmond who strengthen our mission. From hosting activities to beautifying
residential properties to providing one-on-one learning experiences, they
enrich the lives of formerly homeless individuals.</p>
<p>Our manager of volunteer resources, Alison
Jones-Nassar, is the glue that binds volunteers to our residents. Her tireless
efforts and passion for our mission are contagious, as evidenced by the 450 hours
that volunteers serve VSH each month.</p>
<p>Alison is on the run all over town. She rounds up supplies,
orchestrates the volunteers’ magic, and puts everything back in order. In a
single day you might see her with mulch in the morning, paint in the afternoon
and trays of food in the evening. </p>
<p><b>The
Gift of a Truck</b></p>
<p>For years Alison drove her own minivan to transport
these materials. Needless to say, the van took a beating, and we were afraid
Alison’s back would break, too. </p>
<p>Thanks to generous funding from two
of our partners – <b>VCDC</b> and <b>Capital One </b>– we purchased a truck for
the volunteer program. With the Volunteer Mobile, Alison can now store supplies
in the truck rather than in various locations. She is in love with this workshop
on wheels.</p>
<p><b>Help! We Need a Makeover!  </b></p>
<p>The Volunteer Mobile is plain white.
We mean P-L-A-I-N white. <b>With your help,
we can wrap the truck with a cool design that will let people know that great
things are happening wherever they see the truck</b>. With a new identity, the
truck will show volunteers where to gather at work sites and will expand
awareness of our mission. </p>

As a teenager he relocated to Lynchburg, VA, which was to remain his home base the rest of his life. Jordan recorded 12 tracks for Victor Records at two sessions in 1927 and 1929, ten of which have survived on 78s, including his classic versions of ""Church Bell Blues,"" ""Pick Poor Robin Clean,"" and ""Cocaine Blues."" Exhibiting a clean, precise guitar style, <a href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/jordan-mn0000267418"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jordan</a> also possessed an elegant-sounding tenor voice that conveyed a sort of wry, good-natured feel, and his material, drawn from a repertoire of ballads, gambling tunes, ragtime, and minstrel tunes, perfectly defines the Piedmont blues. He was immensely influential on the blues players in his region, and he truly deserves to be better known outside the blues community. He died on June 25, 1952. (Steve Leggett)</p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>Never has there been a release of all 8 songs that Luke recorded in those pioneer years of the blues of the mid to late 20's.  The Sedalia Blues Society will release a CD of all the greats from Bluesman Luke Jordan by Lynchburg Local Blues Artist and other blues acts from around the area.  A very respectful Homage to this local superstar with injections of local artistry that takes these 30's hits and brings them to the modern blues Scene of today.</p>
<p>Blues artists such as Eli Cook, Scott Ainsley, Jon Spear Band, Lasivious Decons, The Bell Hornets, Sheryl Warner, Poorhouse Road Band, Root2 Music, Jump Street and others come together to pay tribute to this amazing bluesman from the 1920s, eight years before Robert Johnson made the blue scene.</p>
<p>We are presenting this campaign to you to raise the necessary funds to pay for recording time and replication of the CDs in the highest industry standard to insure a product that Luke himself would be proud of.  Your donation will be used to bring the clarity and personalization of each of the artists rendition of these timeless classics of the early blues era.</p>
<p>Your contributions will ensure that all money made from this project (not just the profits but all the money) will be used to fund the following organizations in Virginia:</p> <ul> <li>The Sedalia Blues Society      </li> <li>UVA Pediatric Kidney Research    (<a href=""http://research.med.virginia.edu/chrc/current-projects/jennifer-charlton-md"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://research.med.virginia.edu/chrc/current-p...</a>)</li> <li>Kid's Haven in Lynchburg    (<a href=""http://www.kidshavenlynchburg.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.kidshavenlynchburg.org</a>)</li> </ul> <p>You can be the start of an amazing musical project and help raise money for worthy causes right here in Virginia.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Here is in simple form what we are looking for and what you as a donor will receive.</p> <ul> <li>We are looking for a total of 2000 dollars to help fund this project and pay for Recording Studio Time and Replication Cost to create a CD of Luke's Music at the highest Industry Standard.</li> <li>We have multiple levels of giving with Perks at each level including a CD before  you can buy it and T shirts.</li> <li>We only need 20 dollars from 100 people but for some reason we do not make our goal of 2000, the project will continue with the ability to pay for recording after we sell some of the CDs.  </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I think being able to recreate what Luke had created is a very exciting and worth while project for us who live in Virginia.  But it also the chance to share his music to rest of the world.  Luke was an amazing artist and I think the chance to share his music if a positive for everyone involved.  The money raised will be used in developing other projects within the Society, help with Kidney disease research at the award winning hospital (University of Virginia) and ......</p>

<br/><p></p><br/></div>","GIVE YOUR SUPPORT TO ZAGREB BOOK  FESTIVAL Free culture available to everyone, support us a little and enjoy a lot!
Do you „dig“ books? What about music? Reading books and listening to music are definitely the most favourite activities to the majority of people so we decided to fuse them together. But that is not all. We also wanted to add delicious gastronomy, creative workshops and a lot of other interesting shebang. And what is the best thing in all of it? Everything is completely free of charge! Therefore, join us in the first year of Zagreb Book Festival! 

When? From 18th untill 24th of May. Where? At the Museum of Arts and Crafts, Marshal Tito Square 10, Zagreb. Why? Because there you will be able to find stellar crime fiction, meet more than 30 Croatian and foreign book authors, listen to great musicians, visit numerous book promotions, debates and discussions about literature and also experience many other interesting and amusing things. 
Do you plan to take children with you? Great! Bring them to the workshops organized particulary for them and led by the kind ladies from the Roda (Stork) association.  Do you know what is even better? This year the guest-country and one of the ZBF's partners is Kingdom of Sweden, so we are bringing five popular Swedish authors to Croatia to be presented to Croatian audience.Why are we in need of your help?
Organizing such big event requires tremendous effort and considerable financial costs:  accomodation and transportation expenses for the authors, space lease, printing of flyers and program booklets, space setup, authors fees, musicians fees, promotion (presentation) expenses,  translators fees, t-shirts design for volunteers, posters printing, sound system expenses etc. Your financial assistance will help us to heighten the quality of the festival and make it as rich, diverse and interesting as possible. And don't think you won't get anything in return!   
Whatever you decide to donate, everything will be used strictly for this project. If you are not able to help by donating money, but are still willing to help us in some way, we would be pleased and grateful if you could spread the news about the ZBF to as many people as you can.  Under the motto Criminally good books we aim to show that books are not tedious, that crime novels can be top quality literature and that culture doesn't have to be dull and expensive. We want to give Zagreb an annual event that would be awaited with joy and which will bring together visitors of different ages, occupations, people from different crowds and give them a world that will connect them. We want to provide children the opportunity to learn something new and interesting, to meet authors who write books especially for them and people who illustrate their favorite books. We want to show the youth that the adult world is no less interesting and dynamic than their own. We want to demonstrate that books are our future!
The main goal of Zagreb Book Festival is to provide the citizens of Zagreb the event that will turn into an annual event where we would bring new writers and learn about new cultures. What are the challenges?
Our team is experienced in organizing all varieties of projects, but this is the first time we are facing a new challenge in organizing such a major event and that is why we are in need of your help. There are many risks and slight uncertainties that can occur, but we are confident that with your help we can achieve so much!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We've started the project already, and gotten a fair amount completed, but we're still coming up short. We're asking for $1996.00. </p>
<p>Why $1996? Well, that's a bit of an in-joke reference to our song ""I Wrote A Letter To Juliana Hatfield In 1996 And I Still Have Not Received A Letter Back."" (PS : If anyone knows Juliana personally, show her this page.) </p>
<p>How does that break down into discreet costs?</p>
<p>Like this :</p>
<ul>
<li>Studio PC - $760.98 (with <a href=""http://pcpartpicker.com/p/8s6sgs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">these specs</a>)</li>
<li>Acoustic Treatments - $200 (estimated, includes install)</li>
<li>Mastering of ""A Bigger Boat"" - $500 ($50/track at Blue Jade Mastering)</li>

<li>Misc hardware, cables, etc. - $335.02 (estimate)</li>
</ul>
<p>""Ok,"" I hear you say, ""What's in it for me? I mean, you get to make a record....""  </p>
<p>Dear reader, you get a ton of fun and worthwhile rewards. Including :</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital copies of the new Shark Dad album</li>
<li>Your name in the liner notes</li>
<li>Exclusive hand-made Moon Jr. Studios t-shirts</li>
<li>SIGNED physical CD copies of the new Shark Dad album</li>
<li>tickets to a BACKERS-ONLY party at The Heavy Anchor</li>
<li>a Shark Dad show in YOUR HOUSE</li>
<li>a FULL DAY (8 hours max.) of recording at Moon Jr. Studios for YOUR BAND (or ANY band).</li>
</ul>
<h1><b>BONUS GOAL!</b></h1>
<p>We also have planned, if we make more than our goal, a <b>VINYL-ONLY</b> release of some previously un-released Shark Dad tunes on 7"" records with hand-made artwork. So, if you help us reach and exceed our goal, and your support is <b>over the $100 level</b> we will happily send you an <b>EXCLUSIVE VINYL</b> in addition to the perks you're already getting at that level!</p>
<h1>Other Ways You Can Help</h1>
</div><p>If you can't contribute, don't feel like it's the end of the world. Every little bit helps, including spreading this campaign to friends and family and wealthy benefactors. Include this link in a tweet or facebook post, email us at <b>wearesharkdad@gmail.com </b>with proof of posting and we'll have a sticker for you at our next show. </p><p>You can also help by volunteering your time and energy into finishing the physical parts of the studio that still need doing or recommending others who can help.</p><p>Thanks for reading, now rock on with your bad self. </p><div>

You can get your project recorded here as well, full bands, vocal tracks, etc can all be recorded! Check out the $300 level and get yourself a FULL DAY of recording for rock-bottom prices. 
IN SHORT : supporting this campaign does 2 important things -
Gets Shark Dad's first album in your hands -- and fast!
Creates a new studio space for independent musicians
What We Need & What You Get
We've started the project already, and gotten a fair amount completed, but we're still coming up short. We're asking for $1996.00. 
Why $1996? Well, that's a bit of an in-joke reference to our song ""I Wrote A Letter To Juliana Hatfield In 1996 And I Still Have Not Received A Letter Back."" (PS : If anyone knows Juliana personally, show her this page.) 
How does that break down into discreet costs?
Like this :

Studio PC - $760.98 (with these specs)
Acoustic Treatments - $200 (estimated, includes install)
Mastering of ""A Bigger Boat"" - $500 ($50/track at Blue Jade Mastering)
Physical CDs of ""A Bigger Boat"" - $200 (1st small run - ~100 units)
Misc hardware, cables, etc. - $335.02 (estimate)

""Ok,"" I hear you say, ""What's in it for me? I mean, you get to make a record....""  
Dear reader, you get a ton of fun and worthwhile rewards. Including :

Digital copies of the new Shark Dad album
Your name in the liner notes
Exclusive hand-made Moon Jr. Studios t-shirts
SIGNED physical CD copies of the new Shark Dad album
tickets to a BACKERS-ONLY party at The Heavy Anchor
a Shark Dad show in YOUR HOUSE
a FULL DAY (8 hours max.) of recording at Moon Jr. Studios for YOUR BAND (or ANY band).

BONUS GOAL!
We also have planned, if we make more than our goal, a VINYL-ONLY release of some previously un-released Shark Dad tunes on 7"" records with hand-made artwork. So, if you help us reach and exceed our goal, and your support is over the $100 level we will happily send you an EXCLUSIVE VINYL in addition to the perks you're already getting at that level!
Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute, don't feel like it's the end of the world. Every little bit helps, including spreading this campaign to friends and family and wealthy benefactors. Include this link in a tweet or facebook post, email us at wearesharkdad@gmail.com with proof of posting and we'll have a sticker for you at our next show. You can also help by volunteering your time and energy into finishing the physical parts of the studio that still need doing or recommending others who can help.Thanks for reading, now rock on with your bad self.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>What do we need to do?</h3> <p> </p>
<p>Stomp Pad is being developed with performing musicians to make their life easy and fun. Over the next six months our goal is to progress Stomp Pad from a custom made item we make for our musical friends to a precision manufactured product with a solid supply chain so musicians like you can use it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1417328/files/20150426191033-development_timeline_v2.png?1430100633"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>To achieve this we need to make the leap to scalable manufacture together. With your support, we are confident we can deliver Stomp Pad to you as described in our Perks. We are setting out from a strong technical base with Stomp Pads already in use by our beta group musicians who have helped us achieve a great design. The three key Stages in Stomp Pad’s development are: </p>
<p><b>Engage Feedback</b> – Implement Field Testing Feedback. This is occurring now and will continue during the Indiegogo campaign. This largely relates to ensuring the components we have selected are tough enough for you. You can participate and help us with this by choosing our BETA perk and also help out with testing our ‘Stomp Pad’ App (will require Apple’s free Test Flight App).

...one small step for musicians...giant leap for sound!

Often I’m playing instruments and improvising to the audience’s response so I don’t want to be trapped by backing tracks… I want a back beat that can keep up and follow me, adding punch when and where I need it… I'm often in a hurry and need my back beats to be oh so simple to set up and use …my tech feels natural and you just plug it in and it works …with my stuff wherever I am…and I don’t want to lug it around…so here's pocket sized Stomp Pad that works with mobile devices to play big beats 
Stomp Pad can be played in many amazing ways and expands your live sound

What does Stomp Pad do?
Plays sounds on your phone when you touch your foot on Stomp Pad…
What sounds?
Your samples and sounds or those preloaded in apps
Who is the inventor?
Dr Richard Helmer, an experienced musician, scientist, engineer, dad who likes to have fun and who’s been making state-of-the-art interactive technologies that work for all sorts of amazing people … read some wonderful stories here

For independent review by US music tech guru, Barry Rudolph, click here
""I tried out Stomp Pad with GarageBand on my IPHONE 6 and was amazed at how sensitive and quickly it responds to gentle toe tapping. It is super flexible and basically non-destructible--you could toss it on the floor or attach it to your guitar pedal board for controlling iOS guitar effects and amp simulations and then easily pack it away into your gig bag--it weighs nothing."" Barry Rudolph


What do you get?

 
Stomp Pad is designed and tested by performing musicians for musicians to make their life easy and fun. We understand that simplicity, responsiveness, compatibility, and above all else GREAT SOUND are must have features. GREAT SOUNDS!!... how do we do that?…well… you use Stomp Pad with our Stomp Pad App or any MIDI enabled third party App … play your samples and sounds or those preloaded in the many great iOS apps...sounds just like the record... whether your a guitarist, drummer, DJ, vocalist, whatever... there's something Stomp Pad can do for youStomp Pad also works with Windows, Mac, and Linux devices
Easy Set Up... It works as you imagine out of the box with an intuitive design. Plug and Play USB, compatible with USB standards including core MIDI in iOS,  means Stomp Pad is good to go in seconds… 

Natural Feel... intuitive and natural ‘toe tapping’, ‘foot stomping’ feel from our ‘mechanism free’ design. Tap out the beat, touch on/touch off, or put your foot to the floor to drive your sound...whatever the surface



Mobile Ready.. Mobile ready, connect quickly and easily with low power USB-MIDI. A HID class compliant device that is compatible with Core MIDI on iOS, Mac, PC, and Android%. 

Low Latency.. As a drummer and engineer, Dr Helmer understands that responsiveness and natural feel is important for tight beats and this means low latency. Stomp Pad makes use of core MIDI and a high sample rate sensing system to trigger sounds in sync with the haptic sensation of tapping your foot. Basically you can play fast syncopated beats with Stomp Pad

Come along to one of our events and try it for yourself, check out our videos, or follow our social media and see and hear it and how we’ve achieved all this…..

Better still… get on board and choose one of our great Perks that’ll get you stomping as quickly as you want, we’re providing Stomp Pads for performers who have iPhones and iPads etc who are already comfortable using these on stage and for those new to Apple devices or who prefer not to use their iDevices live. We have also provided packs for music teachers and retailers who like to have cutting edge gear and need multiple units (including support and some one-on-one guidance on the many ways to use Stomp Pad). For those who are super excited and want a Stomp Pad as soon as possible and want to help us with our testing and App development, we offer a BETA NOW perk for you to be involved with our pre-release phase 
All up with Stomp Pad you get 

 





Additional items we’ll include with our TOUCH Gig Pack and SCHOOL Pack perks …




The Impact?... Make your mark!!



Stomp Pad is “one small step for musicians…giant leap for your sound…”.  Music these days is as much about compact acts in far flung intimate venues as big sounds on big stages ...  Stomp Pad lets you play any sound anywhere… The technology’s natural toe tapping feel and mechanism free action lets you easily take the perfect rhythmic accompaniment or special effects to easily lift your sound to a whole new level wherever you may roam … all while you rock on with your instruments and vocals. Its so intuitive any musician can use it, tap out the beat or just step up the sound…its simple and responsive. Set up is a breeze – just plug it in and your good to go. Use it with our app and sounds, or play your existing apps  …its compact size, mobile readiness and awesome functionality makes it a great travel companion and it works out of the box with the latest iOS devices**.
Using the smartest e-textile technology Superinteractive’s Stomp Pad is soft, flexible and lightweight = it easily fits in your pocket or guitar case and is ready to travel with you. Stomp pad is reliable and responsive on hard or soft surfaces and the non slip back keeps it spot on.



Whatever your genre, Superinteractive’s Stomp Pad is an essential part of your gig kit … you'll sound awesome!!

    What do we need to do?  
Stomp Pad is being developed with performing musicians to make their life easy and fun. Over the next six months our goal is to progress Stomp Pad from a custom made item we make for our musical friends to a precision manufactured product with a solid supply chain so musicians like you can use it. 



To achieve this we need to make the leap to scalable manufacture together. With your support, we are confident we can deliver Stomp Pad to you as described in our Perks. We are setting out from a strong technical base with Stomp Pads already in use by our beta group musicians who have helped us achieve a great design. The three key Stages in Stomp Pad’s development are: 
Engage Feedback – Implement Field Testing Feedback. This is occurring now and will continue during the Indiegogo campaign. This largely relates to ensuring the components we have selected are tough enough for you. You can participate and help us with this by choosing our BETA perk and also help out with testing our ‘Stomp Pad’ App (will require Apple’s free Test Flight App). We’ll also later replace your BETA Stomp Pad at no further cost with a bulk manufactured production Stomp Pad if you so desire.
Pilot Production – The last step before committing to volume is to test an early example from the production process. You can participate and help by choosing our early bird Stomp Pad EXPRESS Perk.
Pump Up the VOLUME – Our goal is to make Stomp Pad commercially interesting to our suppliers and achieve sustainable Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ). You can help by choosing our VOLUME Perk or any of the TOUCH Pack, SCHOOL, or RetailX  perks. Even just contributing to our BRAVO perk will help us step towards our campaign goal.
Future Ready?... we will continue marketing on the Indiegogo platform after the campaign is complete for the late comers.
Whilst this may be our first Indiegogo campaign, from our e-textile development work with other tough interactive projects  we have already engaged with local manufacturers and suppliers so we are ready to set the pieces in motion for Stomp Pad production. The core activities that we will direct campaign funds toward are:



Stomp Pad Production (approx $12,000, includes patches and bands)


USB-PAD Electronic Interface Cable Production (approx $6,000)


Stomp Pad App Release (approx $2,000) 


Accessories for Perks (approx $3,000)


Campaign Events (approx $2,000)


We can deliver this project relatively efficiently because of our knowledge and experience with similar products, projects and suppliers. You can read about the exciting developments that have helped place Stomp Pad within our reach here.

It is becoming increasingly criminal to simply exist as a ‘person of color’ in this country.  Although laws are “supposed to be” administered in an impartial manner, they are often not.

It's defined as...""Just behavior or treatment, the quality of being fair and reasonable""Justice is being challenged in ways that we  haven’t experienced so blatantly since the Civil Rights era. It is becoming increasingly criminal to simply exist as a ‘person of color’ in this country.  Although laws are “supposed to be” administered in an impartial manner, they are often not.  Arrests are ofttimes disproportionate, made hastily, and partial truths are often leaked to media – to create a false perception.Well, here we are again.  Another miscarriage of justice is being orchestrated and the target this time, Marvin.  Mr. White, who legally carries a concealed weapon, was placed in a scenario where his life was threatened, causing him to legally respond with force.  He was arrested and unjustly charged as a result.  In stark contrast to the whole truth, news outlets have omitted pertinent pieces of information and painted Mr. White with the same brush that every other arrested black man is painted with.

Voices of Valor (created in 2011) is a project of Music For All Seasons (founded in 1991). Voices of Valor helps veterans reintegrate into civilian life through songwriting and recording.  Small groups of veterans work with two professional musician/facilitators and a psychology mentor to write lyrics about their experiences and then record their original song in a studio.  No musical experience is required. 


This project will remaster a dozen songs written and performed by veterans, producing the first full Voices of Valor CD.  The goal is to bring this wonderful music to other veterans and to the public.

Contributors will make a major difference to the veterans whose wonderful work deserves to be heard by a broad audience. By contributing, you can be our partners in this project!   What We Need & What You Get We need to raise $12,000 to re-master the songs, add live rhythm and other solo instrument tracks, polish the sound and give  a totally professional finish, and to produce and print the final product, complete with artwork.
