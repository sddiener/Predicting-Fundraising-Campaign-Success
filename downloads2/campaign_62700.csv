<p>Hi!</p>
<p>My name is Eostar Kamala and I am Merina/Marylee's close friend.   Since Merina told me about her diagnosIs of colon cancer I have tried everything in my power to help her out in her quest for recovery. Right now I am working on orchestrating a fundraiser music event at Jackson Wellsprings (on the 7th of June) in Ashland and I am also jumpstarting this on-line campaign so Merina would have the necessary funds to budget with in her quest for healing using both natural and western healing modalities. Please find out more information about our fundraiser concert on Facebook here: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/470248053053236/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/events/470248053053236/</a></p>
<p>Merina/Marylee has currently opted to to use several different types of treatments including surgery as well as natural methods of healing.  While she chose to have the tumor surgically removed, natural healing practices and herbal remedies/ supplements will be part of her recovery program.  She needs your help to be able to cover these expenses.  Merina will also need a lot of rest which requires a period of time during which she cannot work and earn a living. </p>
<p>I know that we all have our own health issues and our own limited budget but when a dear friend is diagnosed with a life-threatening illness, the community will pull together and nurture the person so needing healing.  So I would like to invite you to be part of Merina's community of friends: fellow spiritual seekers, artists, neighbors, family members or however else you are connected!  Please donate to this wonderful woman who is not only a selfless mom but also a great visionary artist who has created so much mystical beauty to share with others!  </p>
<p>Remeber that someone else's request for help is an invitation to practice selfless service and as such is a true blessing!</p>
<p>About our ""perks"": Those of you offering smaller amounts will be rewarded by small ""perks"" such as a devotional music CD from me and art cards from Merina!  Those of you contributing in a more substantial way will also receive some of Merina's hauntingly beautiful and joyfully mystical art pieces!  To see these please visit the media gallery of this fundraiser and match the titles of the art pieces with the titles of the ""perks"".  You can go to my website (<a href=""http://www.eostar.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.eostar.net</a>) to hear the CD ""Rose and Lotus"".</p>
<p>To all of you - including those who can only afford to help through prayers or showing up to help around Merina's house -  we are eternally grateful!</p>
<p>All funds raised on this site will go directly to Merina/Marylee's bank account and will be used to pay healthcare professionals in the naturopathic medicine field and to fund the recovery process after surgery.  Our goal is to raise $25000 but if she does not meet that goal, she will still get whatever amount was raised.</p>

Happier.</strong> Sleeping poorly ruins your day. You know that, but researchers have shown it too, especially in one notable study that followed 909 working women. A poor night's rest affected their happiness as much as tight work deadlines, and it had an even bigger impact on mood than significant income differences in the group.</p><p><strong>2. Better sex.</strong> Not getting enough sleep lowers libido and can make people more likely to have sexual problems like erectile dysfunction. And sleep itself is restorative — it increases testosterone levels, which boosts sexual drive for both men and women.</p><p><strong>3. Build muscle more easily.</strong> There's a reason that fitness magazines and forums always focus on the importance of sleep. If you don't sleep, you can't build muscle. Your body uses most of the night (except when you are in REM sleep) to heal damage done to your cells and tissues when you are awake and more metabolically active. At the start of the night and during slow wave sleep, your body also releases growth hormone. Lack of sleep, on the other hand, is linked to muscle atrophy.</p><p><strong>4. Learn better. </strong>This isn't just about kids. Adults who get enough sleep do better on tests of short-term memory. And when researchers had adults do a task once, get a good night's sleep, and then try the task again, they showed improvement. But participants who stayed awake 30 hours after learning the same task had a much harder time improving their skills — even if they practiced and had a chance to catch some recovery shut eye later. Something about the initial sleep deprivation impaired their ability to learn. Of course, letting kids get enough sleep is important too. In one case, starting schools an hour later (at 8:30 instead of 7:30) increased ""standardized test scores by at least 2 percentile points in math and 1 percentile point in reading."" The Minneapolis school district found that starting school an hour and a half later (7:15 to 8:40) improved attendance and led to fewer symptoms of depression among students.</p><p><a href=""https://igg.me/at/banala"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531214120/he59kmtkp9fp7zcdihgd.png"" src=""""/></a></p><p><strong>5. Better and safer driver.</strong> Driving sleepy is like driving drunk. Both are a common cause of serious injuries and in tests, sleep-deprived drivers perform like alcohol-impaired drivers. Drowsy driving is responsible for 100,000 crashes and 1,500 deaths every year, according to the National Sleep Foundation. Almost 20% of serious injuries in crashes happen when there's a sleepy driver involved.</p><p><strong>6. One of the best ways to stay fit. </strong>Multiple studies show that people who sleep less are more likely to be obese. One study that followed 500 people for 13 years found that people who regularly slept less than seven hours a night were 7.5 times more likely to be overweight — even after controlling for physical activity, family history, and demographic factors. Researchers think this is mostly due to hormonal changes caused by sleep deprivation — not getting enough sleep stimulates your appetite. Basically, one of the most effective diet hacks possible is just getting enough sleep.</p><p><strong>7. People who don't sleep enough are more likely to develop diabetes — even if they are skinny. </strong>Type 2 diabetes is an awful disease that can lead to strokes, amputations, blindness, and organ damage. And this isn't just about obesity, so if you are skinny but don't get enough sleep this still applies. Otherwise healthy adults lose their ability to control blood sugar without getting enough sleep, and the less sleep someone gets, the more likely they are to develop a problem. Compared to adults who sleep seven to eight hours a night, people who sleep six hours are 1.7 times as likely to develop diabetes, and people who sleep five hours are 2.5 times as likely to develop diabetes.</p><p><strong>8. Better moods and fewer problems with depression and anxiety.</strong> People who sleep less tend to have more symptoms of depression, lower self esteem, and more anxiety — though that's an association and it's possible that those symptoms cause people to sleep less. Still, a review of studies shows that sleep loss has an even stronger effect on mood than it does on cognitive ability or motor function, which is a strong indicator that sleeping more could help.</p><p><a href=""https://igg.me/at/banala"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531214161/n1csb5xjy7inqdffsgsn.png"" src=""""/></a></p><p><strong>9. Healthier skin. </strong>Along with mood disorders, sleeping poorly is also associated with chronic skin conditions. Some research shows that poor sleep, depression, anxiety, and chronic skin problems all go together. A study published in Clinical and Experimental Dermatology found that ""good sleepers"" recovered better after ultraviolet light exposure, and their skin also recovered more quickly after having tape stripped off of it. They also showed fewer signs of aging.</p><p><strong>10. Less likely to make risky financial decisions.</strong> When people are tired, the way they make financial decisions changes. Instead of trying to minimize loss, they start looking for risky big gains. That's a good reason to make sure you sleep before making any big purchases — and it also raises some questions about the insane hours some Wall Street employees log. 11. Less time and money at the doctor. People who score high on a ""sleepiness scale"" use 11% more healthcare resources than their well-rested brethren. Sleep troubles caused by sleep apnea and insomnia cost the US billions of dollars in direct medical costs every year, and that's even before taking into account the associated lost productivity.</p><p><strong>11. Adolescents who sleep enough are less likely to abuse alcohol. </strong>According to the Institute of Medicine, sleep problems are associated with alcohol abuse. Adolescents who have sleeping problems are more likely to develop problems abusing alcohol — though it's also true that people who abuse alcohol have trouble sleeping well. Still, researchers believe that having a disrupted circadian rhythm causes changes in the reward system of the brain. This, in turn, makes those adolescents more likely to engage in risky behavior and to develop alcohol use disorders.</p><p><strong>12. Easier to speak well.</strong> We know that people who drive tired are similar to those who drive drunk, but did you know that staying awake too long can cause slurred speech, repetitive word usage, and a slow, monotonous tone? So make sure to get some rest before your next presentation.</p><p><strong>13. Prevent migraines and other headaches.</strong> If you find yourself cringing due to sudden head pain, look at your sleep schedule. Even though doctors aren't sure exactly why this happens, multiple studies show that people who don't sleep enough are more likely to suffer migraines. ""Poor sleep quality is uniquely associated with episodic migraine,"" write the authors of one recent study (emphasis ours). Additionally, 36 to 58% of sleep apnea sufferers wake up with a throbbing head.</p><p><a href=""https://igg.me/at/banala"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531214218/kj61os8hn4ynrt3luk4p.png"" src=""""/></a></p><p><strong>14. More productive at work and more focused at home. </strong>The more tired you are, the harder it to concentrate on something, and distraction can take a toll on both work and your personal life. Researchers say that ""attention tasks appear to be particularly sensitive to sleep loss."" So if you want to focus — either on a job or a conversation — make sure to get some rest.</p><p><strong>15. Make fewer dangerous mistakes.</strong> Though we don't always recognize it, we make more mistakes when we don't get enough sleep. For some of us that amounts to a typo here and there, which is annoying to our editors, but such carelessness can be more serious.</p><p>In 2003, the body that regulates medical residents' hours decided to limit those hours to 80 hours a week with no shifts longer than 24 hours (there's a reason why medical residents show up frequently in sleep deprivation studies). But a Harvard study afterwards found that if those hours were further reduced to 63 a week, residents slept more and made fewer serious medical errors. The more sleep-deprived group made 22% more serious errors. Famous accidents like the Space Shuttle Challenger explosion and the Exxon Valdez oil spill have been attributed, at least in part, to mistakes made by people who didn't get enough sleep. But it's not just these major events: All sleep-deprived workers are much more likely to have a dangerous accident. One study of 50,000 people in Sweden found that lack of sleep made people twice as likely to die in an accident.</p><p><strong>16. See better We don't function well without sleep. </strong>Our bodies get tired and our eyes get tired. The longer you stay awake, the more vision errors you make, ranging from tunnel vision to seeing double to even — eventually, at scary levels of sleep loss — hallucinations.</p><p><strong>17. Less likely to catch a cold.</strong> While going out in the cold doesn't make you more likely to catch one, being exposed to one does. But if you haven't slept before being exposed to a virus, your weakened immune system makes you much more likely to catch it. When researchers exposed a group of 153 people to the common cold, those who had been sleeping less than seven hours a night were almost three times more likely to catch the virus.</p><p><a href=""https://igg.me/at/banala"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531214264/qqbhyrufhccipzd64xks.png"" src=""""/></a></p><p><strong>18. Less likely to develop certain kinds of cancer. </strong>People who do shift work (night shifts) and have disrupted circadian cycles — and thus don't sleep enough — are likely to encounter some serious health problems. One association that researchers have found is that these night workers are more likely to develop colon and breast cancer.</p><p><strong>19. Less easily irritated or upset. </strong>When you don't sleep enough you're more emotionally volatile and more easily irritated — a little thing can make you blow up or ruin your morning even more. According to a study published by an Israeli research team, sleep deprivation amplifies negative emotions caused by small things like interruptions. The researchers studied medical residents, who as we know are tragically familiar with not getting enough sleep.</p><p><strong>20. Feel less pain after a good night of sleep. </strong>Not getting enough sleep makes people more sensitive to pain — which can lead to a terrible cycle for chronic pain sufferers. Tests show that keeping people up all night makes it easier for them to feel pain. There's even evidence that not getting enough sleep can interfere with the pain relief processes of certain drugs. By the same token, getting good sleep can function like low level pain medication.</p><p><strong>21. Better reactions.</strong> Researchers have tested college athletes and West Point cadets— pretty fit groups with pretty well-honed reactions in the first place. Overall strength isn't necessarily affected by losing a night's sleep, but after one sleep-deprived night people's reactions aren't as quick. The researchers theorize this is probably caused by a diminished ability to use information to make decisions.</p><p><strong>22. Fewer heart problems.</strong> One large study found that sleeping five hours or less a night was associated with a 45% increased risk for heart attacks. Keeping people awake increases their blood pressure — even healthy young men who have one bad night of only 3.6 hours of sleep show significant temporary changes.</p><p><a href=""https://igg.me/at/banala"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531214317/xvoaewmorbpzomxydw6x.png"" src=""""/></a></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531202361/zuqiikxdb3o504fckd8c.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/banala-world-s-first-sleep-aid-alarm-clock/payments/new?perk_id=4549798"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531216922/cos4qy3a06ppuwudbuel.png"" src=""""/></a></p><p><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/banala-world-s-first-sleep-aid-alarm-clock/payments/new?perk_id=4549984"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531217270/mtv419mdnovnvgefjtma.png"" src=""""/></a></p><p><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/banala-world-s-first-sleep-aid-alarm-clock/payments/new?perk_id=4549989"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531217290/avzb9d7v0mmaraukohol.png"" src=""""/></a></p><p><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/banala-world-s-first-sleep-aid-alarm-clock/payments/new?perk_id=4549990"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531217309/adsjzvxis1byr94rqtbn.png"" src=""""/></a></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531202408/gxdxbv30us0lvz0j6eqa.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531202429/ox1bfvj8bpenmbrxi3po.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Banala Life is a company dedicated to helping people all over the world sleep better.

Spent the night tossing and turning — how you’ll feel the next day? Tired, cranky, and out of sorts. Let’s Banala help you out.Banala is a patented bedside Alarm Clock integrated with Isochronic Sound technology to put you to the best sleep ever, every night.Several studies have proven the incredible benefits of Isochronic Tone. Although they are well-known in the medical community, they are not as widespread among the rest of society. We decided to bring the benefits to your sleep journey. It’s a natural and effective way to improve sleep and well-being.This is the best Alarm Clock yet to put you to sleep and wake you up with a brand new you!Banala will take you to the new level of sleep journey from the very beginning through the wake-up.  Isochronic TonesImproving Sleep and for Power Napping – When you're struggling to get to sleep, it's very likely that your brain is producing too much beta activity.  Banala with Isochronic Tone technology can be used to reduce beta activity and increase more in the low delta and theta frequency range.  Helping you get to sleep faster and deeper.Brainwave Frequencies for Better SleepBrainwave speed is measured in Hertz (Hz) and relates to how many times they cycle per second.  A 5Hz brainwave simply means that it is cycling at a rate of 5 times per second.Our brainwave activity reflects how we are feeling and what we are doing. If slower brainwaves are dominant we can feel sleepy, very relaxed or dreamy.With brainwave entrainment methods like isochronic tones, they are used to stimulate and produce more brainwave activity of a specific frequency or range, making that more dominant. Which make Banala effectively put you to the best sleep. You could seek to reduce high brain wave frequency by listening to slower speed isochronic tones, which would help calm your mind and bring down your stress levels. Delta Waves0.2Hz-3Hz – Delta waves are very slow and low in frequency. You produce the most delta activity during your deepest sleep. It's during delta that your body does most of it's healing and regenerating of cells.Theta Waves 3Hz to 8Hz – Theta waves are also mainly dominant during sleep, or in a state of deep relaxation or when we are drifting in and out of sleep.    1. Happier. Sleeping poorly ruins your day. You know that, but researchers have shown it too, especially in one notable study that followed 909 working women. A poor night's rest affected their happiness as much as tight work deadlines, and it had an even bigger impact on mood than significant income differences in the group.2. Better sex. Not getting enough sleep lowers libido and can make people more likely to have sexual problems like erectile dysfunction. And sleep itself is restorative — it increases testosterone levels, which boosts sexual drive for both men and women.3. Build muscle more easily. There's a reason that fitness magazines and forums always focus on the importance of sleep. If you don't sleep, you can't build muscle. Your body uses most of the night (except when you are in REM sleep) to heal damage done to your cells and tissues when you are awake and more metabolically active. At the start of the night and during slow wave sleep, your body also releases growth hormone. Lack of sleep, on the other hand, is linked to muscle atrophy.4. Learn better. This isn't just about kids. Adults who get enough sleep do better on tests of short-term memory. And when researchers had adults do a task once, get a good night's sleep, and then try the task again, they showed improvement. But participants who stayed awake 30 hours after learning the same task had a much harder time improving their skills — even if they practiced and had a chance to catch some recovery shut eye later. Something about the initial sleep deprivation impaired their ability to learn. Of course, letting kids get enough sleep is important too. In one case, starting schools an hour later (at 8:30 instead of 7:30) increased ""standardized test scores by at least 2 percentile points in math and 1 percentile point in reading."" The Minneapolis school district found that starting school an hour and a half later (7:15 to 8:40) improved attendance and led to fewer symptoms of depression among students.5. Better and safer driver. Driving sleepy is like driving drunk. Both are a common cause of serious injuries and in tests, sleep-deprived drivers perform like alcohol-impaired drivers. Drowsy driving is responsible for 100,000 crashes and 1,500 deaths every year, according to the National Sleep Foundation. Almost 20% of serious injuries in crashes happen when there's a sleepy driver involved.6. One of the best ways to stay fit. Multiple studies show that people who sleep less are more likely to be obese. One study that followed 500 people for 13 years found that people who regularly slept less than seven hours a night were 7.5 times more likely to be overweight — even after controlling for physical activity, family history, and demographic factors. Researchers think this is mostly due to hormonal changes caused by sleep deprivation — not getting enough sleep stimulates your appetite. Basically, one of the most effective diet hacks possible is just getting enough sleep.7. People who don't sleep enough are more likely to develop diabetes — even if they are skinny. Type 2 diabetes is an awful disease that can lead to strokes, amputations, blindness, and organ damage. And this isn't just about obesity, so if you are skinny but don't get enough sleep this still applies. Otherwise healthy adults lose their ability to control blood sugar without getting enough sleep, and the less sleep someone gets, the more likely they are to develop a problem. Compared to adults who sleep seven to eight hours a night, people who sleep six hours are 1.7 times as likely to develop diabetes, and people who sleep five hours are 2.5 times as likely to develop diabetes.8. Better moods and fewer problems with depression and anxiety. People who sleep less tend to have more symptoms of depression, lower self esteem, and more anxiety — though that's an association and it's possible that those symptoms cause people to sleep less. Still, a review of studies shows that sleep loss has an even stronger effect on mood than it does on cognitive ability or motor function, which is a strong indicator that sleeping more could help.9. Healthier skin. Along with mood disorders, sleeping poorly is also associated with chronic skin conditions. Some research shows that poor sleep, depression, anxiety, and chronic skin problems all go together. A study published in Clinical and Experimental Dermatology found that ""good sleepers"" recovered better after ultraviolet light exposure, and their skin also recovered more quickly after having tape stripped off of it. They also showed fewer signs of aging.10. Less likely to make risky financial decisions. When people are tired, the way they make financial decisions changes. Instead of trying to minimize loss, they start looking for risky big gains. That's a good reason to make sure you sleep before making any big purchases — and it also raises some questions about the insane hours some Wall Street employees log. 11. Less time and money at the doctor. People who score high on a ""sleepiness scale"" use 11% more healthcare resources than their well-rested brethren. Sleep troubles caused by sleep apnea and insomnia cost the US billions of dollars in direct medical costs every year, and that's even before taking into account the associated lost productivity.11. Adolescents who sleep enough are less likely to abuse alcohol. According to the Institute of Medicine, sleep problems are associated with alcohol abuse. Adolescents who have sleeping problems are more likely to develop problems abusing alcohol — though it's also true that people who abuse alcohol have trouble sleeping well. Still, researchers believe that having a disrupted circadian rhythm causes changes in the reward system of the brain. This, in turn, makes those adolescents more likely to engage in risky behavior and to develop alcohol use disorders.12. Easier to speak well. We know that people who drive tired are similar to those who drive drunk, but did you know that staying awake too long can cause slurred speech, repetitive word usage, and a slow, monotonous tone? So make sure to get some rest before your next presentation.13. Prevent migraines and other headaches. If you find yourself cringing due to sudden head pain, look at your sleep schedule. Even though doctors aren't sure exactly why this happens, multiple studies show that people who don't sleep enough are more likely to suffer migraines. ""Poor sleep quality is uniquely associated with episodic migraine,"" write the authors of one recent study (emphasis ours). Additionally, 36 to 58% of sleep apnea sufferers wake up with a throbbing head.14. More productive at work and more focused at home. The more tired you are, the harder it to concentrate on something, and distraction can take a toll on both work and your personal life. Researchers say that ""attention tasks appear to be particularly sensitive to sleep loss."" So if you want to focus — either on a job or a conversation — make sure to get some rest.15. Make fewer dangerous mistakes. Though we don't always recognize it, we make more mistakes when we don't get enough sleep.

Lino is a Computer Engineer with a strong experience in Software Architectures, Embedded Systems and Telecommunication Networks; Mariano is a senior Geologist, informed and actively involved in the environmental discussions, with the passion for innovative technologies. </i></p><p><i>Our dream is to contribute to the discussion about the air quality, with an useful idea.</i></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p></p><p><b><i><br/></i></b></p><p><b><i>What is SmartNoseDust?</i></b></p>
<p><i>SmartNoseDust is an
electronic nose that measures the concentration of fine particles and
pollutants in the air, communicating it in real time, via smartphone, to a web portal. SmatNoseDust measures the following particles:</i></p>
<p><i>· Coarse
Particulate Matter (PM10)</i></p>
<p><i>· Particulate
Matter (PM2.5)</i></p>
<p><i>· Carbon Monoxide
(CO)</i></p>
<i>· Ozone (O3)</i><br/><p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>The
idea for SmartNoseDust happened during our holidays 2 years ago. We began to
observe the impact of the air quality on the health of our children, then we
started comparing what happens in the city, in the mountains and near the sea.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>Hence,
the need of an in-depth investigation on how to realize a hands-on tool for
people, in order to evaluate and share transparently, the quality of the air in
the urban and outer-urban areas.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>During
this year we have created the first prototype of the electric nose, the iPhone
App and the web portal, completely funded with our own resources</i>. </p>
<p><i>From
beginning of October, we have been working parallel with the first campaign of
Particulate Matter (PM10) measurement in Campania, Tuscany and Abruzzo. The first
results were very encouraging: we have compared our collected data with
professional instrumentation (more complex and expensive), which resulted
more-less the same...</i></p>
<p><i>With
a detector device positioned in areas at risk, the detector could control not
only the quality of the air but in the case of fire or smoke would send a text
message  to the nearest Fire Brigade for
an immediate intervention to put out the fire and in the case of arson the same
text would be sent to the local Police station giving the possibility to catch
the villains. </i></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>In
Italy the quality of the air is controlled by a regional body ARPAC, they have
only 19 of their own extremely expensive detectors over the whole of this
region, which means in an area between a large city like Naples and Accerra,
for example  the town of Casoria, the
calculation of quality is measured by adding together the data from Naples and
Accerra, then dividing by two. Not a very accurate or scientific result.</i></p>

now we are on the right track to create something useful for the whole
community ...</i></p>
<p><b><i><br/></i></b></p><p><b><i>What
We Need?</i></b></p>
<p><i>The
SmartNoseDust funding campaign is needed to cover two main aspects of our
project:</i></p>
<p><i>•
Industrialize the SmartNoseDust full kit, the complete tool for PM10, PM2.5,
Ozone and CO measurement. </i></p>
<p><i>•
Create a first prototype network to monitor critical urban and outer-urban
areas (e.g. ""Terra dei Fuochi"")</i></p>
<p><i>We
have estimated that, approximately 70.000 Euros of funding will be necessary. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">In
the case we don't reach our funding target, we are convinced about striving  ahead.</span></i></p>
<p><i>Our
argument is: the prevention of diseases, deriving from poor air quality, is a
problem that should not be underestimated: we are ready, if necessary, to get
back in the game with other initiatives.. </i></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><i>A
plethora of perks are waiting for you!!</i></span></p>
<p><i>We
start with the citation as contributor on the SmartNoseDust site, passing to
the SmartNoseDust T-Shirt gadget, up to the possibility to get your hands on different
versions of the SmartNoseDust tool. </i></p>
<p><i>Air
quality information can be also used as a technology enabler to make decisions
on urban and outer-urban areas intervention: in this way, we can prepare and
collaborate with Business partners, in order to share the SmartNoseDust
Application Programming Interface (S-API). </i></p>
<p><b><i><br/></i></b></p><p><b><i>What's
the impact of the SmartNoseDust?</i></b></p>
<p><i>SmartNoseDust
is a disruptive idea that puts in your hands a tool to participate, continuously, in the discussion regarding the quality of the air you breathe...</i></p>
<p><i>SmartNoseDust
is the first social application conceived to measure and share information
about Particulate Matter, Ozone and Carbon Monoxide concentration in the air.</i></p>
<p><i>SmartNoseDust
can measure and share data both in combination with a smartphone
(Apple/Samsung, etc.) or in standalone mode, via a GSM channel. This means that
can be used in a twofold mode: as a portable measurement tool, to measure and
share information about air quality, or as fixed tool, acting as sentry for
urban and outer-urban areas. </i></p>
<p><i>With
this project we are creating a new dimension, that is the knowledge of knowing
what we breathe...</i></p>
<p><i>We're
just at the beginning.... and with the same techniques, we can start to learn
about everything that surrounds us (e.g. electromagnetic radiation, water
quality, food quality and so on...)</i></p>
<p><i><b><br/></b></i></p><p><i><b>How
to help us?</b></i></p>
<p><i>Funding

Lino is a Computer Engineer with a strong experience in Software Architectures, Embedded Systems and Telecommunication Networks; Mariano is a senior Geologist, informed and actively involved in the environmental discussions, with the passion for innovative technologies. Our dream is to contribute to the discussion about the air quality, with an useful idea.What is SmartNoseDust?
SmartNoseDust is an
electronic nose that measures the concentration of fine particles and
pollutants in the air, communicating it in real time, via smartphone, to a web portal. SmatNoseDust measures the following particles:
· Coarse
Particulate Matter (PM10)
· Particulate
Matter (PM2.5)
· Carbon Monoxide
(CO)
· Ozone (O3)
The
idea for SmartNoseDust happened during our holidays 2 years ago. We began to
observe the impact of the air quality on the health of our children, then we
started comparing what happens in the city, in the mountains and near the sea.
Hence,
the need of an in-depth investigation on how to realize a hands-on tool for
people, in order to evaluate and share transparently, the quality of the air in
the urban and outer-urban areas.
During
this year we have created the first prototype of the electric nose, the iPhone
App and the web portal, completely funded with our own resources. 
From
beginning of October, we have been working parallel with the first campaign of
Particulate Matter (PM10) measurement in Campania, Tuscany and Abruzzo. The first
results were very encouraging: we have compared our collected data with
professional instrumentation (more complex and expensive), which resulted
more-less the same...
With
a detector device positioned in areas at risk, the detector could control not
only the quality of the air but in the case of fire or smoke would send a text
message  to the nearest Fire Brigade for
an immediate intervention to put out the fire and in the case of arson the same
text would be sent to the local Police station giving the possibility to catch
the villains. 
In
Italy the quality of the air is controlled by a regional body ARPAC, they have
only 19 of their own extremely expensive detectors over the whole of this
region, which means in an area between a large city like Naples and Accerra,
for example  the town of Casoria, the
calculation of quality is measured by adding together the data from Naples and
Accerra, then dividing by two. Not a very accurate or scientific result.
The SmartNoseDust website www.smartnosedust.com and the its
relative Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/smartnosedust , are currently having a great success: for this reason we argue that
now we are on the right track to create something useful for the whole
community ...
What
We Need?
The
SmartNoseDust funding campaign is needed to cover two main aspects of our
project:
•
Industrialize the SmartNoseDust full kit, the complete tool for PM10, PM2.5,
Ozone and CO measurement. 
•
Create a first prototype network to monitor critical urban and outer-urban
areas (e.g. ""Terra dei Fuochi"")
We
have estimated that, approximately 70.000 Euros of funding will be necessary. In
the case we don't reach our funding target, we are convinced about striving  ahead.
Our
argument is: the prevention of diseases, deriving from poor air quality, is a
problem that should not be underestimated: we are ready, if necessary, to get
back in the game with other initiatives.. A
plethora of perks are waiting for you!!
We
start with the citation as contributor on the SmartNoseDust site, passing to
the SmartNoseDust T-Shirt gadget, up to the possibility to get your hands on different
versions of the SmartNoseDust tool. 
Air
quality information can be also used as a technology enabler to make decisions
on urban and outer-urban areas intervention: in this way, we can prepare and
collaborate with Business partners, in order to share the SmartNoseDust
Application Programming Interface (S-API). 
What's
the impact of the SmartNoseDust?
SmartNoseDust
is a disruptive idea that puts in your hands a tool to participate, continuously, in the discussion regarding the quality of the air you breathe...
SmartNoseDust
is the first social application conceived to measure and share information
about Particulate Matter, Ozone and Carbon Monoxide concentration in the air.
SmartNoseDust
can measure and share data both in combination with a smartphone
(Apple/Samsung, etc.) or in standalone mode, via a GSM channel. This means that
can be used in a twofold mode: as a portable measurement tool, to measure and
share information about air quality, or as fixed tool, acting as sentry for
urban and outer-urban areas. 
With
this project we are creating a new dimension, that is the knowledge of knowing
what we breathe...
We're
just at the beginning.... and with the same techniques, we can start to learn
about everything that surrounds us (e.g. electromagnetic radiation, water
quality, food quality and so on...)
How
to help us?

QUIERES SABER MÁS? // DO YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE?
Así nació Siempre Secos // Thus was born Always Dry
A raíz de vivir en primera persona los problemas del uso de pañales, decidimos desarrollar una solución para nuestro caso. Al compartir nuestra experiencia con otras personas nos dimos cuenta de que el uso de pañales es mucho más habitual de lo que pensábamos y que afecta a diferentes colectivos de personas: padres y madres de bebés, niños con enuresis nocturna, personas con incontinencia urinaria, ancianos y dependientes.Having firsthand experience the problems of using diapers we decided to develop a solution for our case. By sharing our experience with others we realized that using diapers is far more common than we thought and it affects different groups of people who use: parents of babies, children with nighttime bedwetting , people with urinary incontinence, the elderly and dependent.
Como cuidadores NO hemos encontrado en el mercado una solución satisfactoria para gestionar el uso de estos consumibles por lo que nos hemos puesto manos a la obra para desarrollar este producto que pensamos nos ayudaría y ayudaría a mucha gente en su día a día, tanto si son usuarios como si son cuidadores.As caregivers we have NOT found in the market a satisfactory solution to manage these supplies, so we set to work on developing this product we thought would help us and help many people in their daily lives, whether users as if they are caregivers.
Nuestro objetivo es desarrollar un dispositivo de aviso para todos los usuarios de pañal y sus cuidadores, que sea discreto, cómodo, higiénico, fácil de utilizar y adaptado a las necesidades de cada colectivo de usuarios, y así dar tranquilidad a las madres respecto a cuando cambiar el pañal, tratar eficazmente la enuresis nocturna, evitar la dermatitis del pañal, mejorar la autogestión de la incontinencia urinaria, mejorar la privacidad del usuario adulto del pañal, facilitar el trabajo del cuidador y permitir a los centros residenciales proporcionar una atención personalizada a la vez que reducen costes.Our goal is to develop a warning device for all diaper users and their carers, discreet, comfortable, hygienic, easy to use and tailored to the needs of each group of users, and thus reassure mothers about when to change the diaper, provide effective treatment for nighttime bedwetting, prevent diaper rash, improve self-management of urinary incontinence, improve user privacy adult diaper, facilitate the work of the caregiver and allowing residential centers provide personalized service and reduce costs.

<p> Hello, we are SENS! A young European team operating in 6 different languages, but mostly in English. It all started when Daniel and Radek fell in love with entomophagy, the practice of eating insects, and what it could bring to our planet’s current state. They teamed-up with a renowned chef with 13 years of experience in cooking with insects. The chef took part in making our bars taste great, while we focused on the nutritional content with the help from various nutritional experts and food technologists.</p>

</div></div>","The idea of our diet has not been challenged in a long time. We decided to rethink the usual - to innovate food products using science and data. With the latest research in insect-eating, strict nutritional facts, and data analysis, we have come up with recipes for two all-natural products made with cricket flour - the best and the most sustainable protein source in the world.

We offer 2 categories of bars containing dried and milled crickets:  
PROTEIN BAR - the most innovative, all-natural, organic, low-carbohydrate protein bar, containing 20 grams of the highest quality protein in each bar.  
ENERGY BAR - a delicious, low-glycemic, organic fruity snack, packed with nutrients such as iron, calcium, omega 3 fatty acids, and the highest quality proteins.

  







FYI: As we are still fine-tuning the recipe of the bar, the final nutrition facts can slightly change in the future.

At SENS, we want to stay close to nature; therefore, we plan to pack our bars in a paper packaging and have wax on the inside. The bars will also be sealed in a modified atmosphere which increases shelf life.  
Thanks to the combination of these packaging ways and a smart selection of ingredients, we can guarantee a 1-year shelf life without the need of chemicals or added preservatives.

Die Vorstellung von unserer Ernährung wurde schon lange nicht mehr richtig hinterfragt. Wir haben uns dazu entschlossen das Gewohnte zu überdenken – hin zu innovativen Nahrungmitteln, unterstützt von Wissenschaft und Fakten. Unter Ausnutzung der neuesten Erkenntnisse über Insekten als Nahrungsmittel, alimentärer Fakten und Datenauswertung, haben wir Rezepte für zwei reine Naturprodukte mit Grillenmehl – der besten und nachhaltigsten Eiweißquelle der Welt – entwickelt.

Wir bieten zwei Arten von Riegeln mit getrockneten und gemahlenen Grillen an:  
EIWEIßRIEGEL – Der innovative, rein natürliche, organischer, kohlenhydratarme Eiweißriegel mit 20 Gramm hochwertigem Eiweiß in jedem Riegel.
ENERGIERIEGEL – Ein köstlich süßer und organischer Snack mit geringem glykämischem Index, voll mit Nährstoffen wie Eisen, Kalzium, Omega-3-Fettsäuren und hochwertigem Eiweiß.










Hier bei SENS wollen wir uns die Nähe zur Natur bewahren. Deshalb planen wir unsere Riegel mit einer Papierverpackung mit Innenbeschichtung aus Wachs zu versehen. Die Riegel werden außerdem in einer Schutzgaspackung versiegelt um die Haltbarkeit zu erhöhen.
Dank der Kombination aus den beiden Verpackungsmethoden und einer bewussten Auswahl der verwendeten Zutaten können wir eine Mindesthaltbarkeit von einem Jahr auch ohne Chemikalien und Konservierungsstoffe gewährleisten.

<h1>Why soap? </h1>
<p>Clare traveled to Kaberamaido, Uganda in the spring of 2012 where she witnessed the desperate need for basic health necessities.  Clare eventually brainstormed an idea to make her own soap and use proceeds to donate/invest in developing communities that lacked basic sanitation.</p>
<p>After pitching the idea to Jessie, the pair did their research and realized that there was a problem at home. They didn't recognize any of the ingredients listed on the average bar soap. And thus, a two-fold vision was born - 1) to educate and provide an all-natural product for those at home and 2) to create a sustainable sanitation program for the people in Kaberamaido, Uganda.</p>
<h1>What we've done so far...</h1>
<p>Believe it or not, the past 8-9 months were filled with busy nights and weekends. Here's a rough timeline. </p>
<p><strong>August/September</strong>: Researched the all-natural soap market. Learned how to make soap, experimented with flavors, scents, etc...</p>
<p><strong>October</strong>: Hurricane Sandy hits. Enough said. </p>
<p><strong>November/December</strong>: Started creating the brand, including the logo and website. After conducting several rounds of pricing sensitivity analysis, decided we wanted to create an affordable all-natural soap, as many alternatives were priced between $8-10. Settled on a $4.99/bar pricing strategy for core soaps. </p>
<div class=""template asset"">

<p><strong>January</strong>: Obtained a LLC, small business bank account, and squared away other logistical issues. Selected <em>Shopify</em> as our ecommerce solution. Contacted a ton of packaging companies for packaging solutions. Created our <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/baresoaps"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook fanpage</a>!</p>
<p><strong>February</strong>: Finalized shipping. Decided on a $5.99 flat rate shipping model that encompasses 2-3 day shipping with tracking ability (while supporting our favorite USPS postman!)</p>
<p><strong>March</strong>: Solidified marketing segmentation with goal of not only providing an affordable all natural soap alternative, but also an educational experience to encourage eco-friendly/sustainable solutions. Scrapped previous boxing ideas and embraced recycled packaging including seeded-paper that can be planted! </p>
<p><strong>April</strong>: Working on finalizing product packaging, streamlining processes, and launching a crowdfunding campaign!</p>
<p>Throughout the entire time, we continuously made dozens upon dozens of bars of soap. We gave them out to friends and family to test and solicited feedback from the labeling to the product itself. </p>

<h1>Our Vision</h1>
<p>In the past few months, we’ve debated and wrestled with our vision. At first we wanted to follow a ""buy one, give one"" model.  At the same time, we knew we wanted to instill a spirit of entrepreneurialism within the villagers. After reading “When Helping Hurts” by Steve Corbett &amp; Brian Fikkert, we realized the fallacies and faults in the ""buy one, give one"" model. </p>
<ul>
<li>Soap is a consumable good. What happens after the donated bar runs out? </li>
<li>Would we be hindering the progress of local soapmakers by giving our bars away for free?</li>
<li>How can we instill a spirit of entrepreneurialism if locals expect free bars?</li>
<li>Is it even feasible for us to donate the bars? There are logistical and customs issues (and potentially corruption).</li>
</ul><p>As Corbett and Brian have correctly observed, it is important to understand that<strong>development is not done <em>to</em> people or <em>for</em> people but <em>with</em> people. </strong></p>

<p>The initial hope is to provide soap and educate people the importance of sanitation. Our long-term vision is to invest in communities by teaching the trade of soap making as a mean of economic self-sustainability. This differs greatly from many social enterprises that are simply “giving” resources away. Our model will involve commitment, perseverance, and investments in relationships, but it is one that we are willing to commit too.</p>
<h1>Hmm... seriously, do people need soap?</h1>
<p>The short and obvious answer is <strong>YES</strong>. Otherwise, we, as well as many other non-profits and charities would not be doing this. Sanitation is a HUGE issue in many parts of the world. </p>

<h1>So, I'm hooked, but who should use our soaps?</h1>
<p><strong>Anyone and everyone</strong>! Our soaps are made from 100% all natural ingredients. We use a blend of palm, olive, coconut, soy, and castor oil and enrich all bars with shea butter. We only use essential oils (not fragrance oils) to scent our bars, and any exfoliants or colorants are also 100% all natural. </p>
<p>All natural soaps are great for those with sensitive skin. We've had super positive feedback, including those with children. One mother particularly loves our soap because it easily cleans away markings and stampings on her child's skin! But like all products, we recommend that you test the soap on a small area of your skin before using it on your whole body.</p>
<h1>Soap Care</h1>
<p>If taken care of properly, an all natural bar of soap should last the same, if not longer, amount of time as your average commercial bar soap. We recommend storing the soap in a dry and cool area with open ventilation, so soap dishes are advised to prevent water from accumulating under the soap. It's also important that you do not store your soap in a sealed container or zip lock bag.</p>
<p>Remember, because our soaps do not contain preservatives, we recommend using our soap within a year.</p>

</div></h3></div>","About this project
The Broke Man's half marathon is about spreading the love of longer distance running, community, and the benefits of physical fitness. People should be able to run, and enjoy the positive atmosphere of the organized race, regardless of ability to pay heafty race fees. Thus, the Broke Man's half marathon was born. 
Each year the Broke Man's half marathon has been runner funded! Meaning, we build the race according to the budget that is laid out based off of registration. This has aloud us to create an awesome race for the runners so far. 
But this year... we want to do more. 
The Broke Man's would like to move out of the park atmosphere and move onto the streets, as well as provide a little more of an organized atmosphere for the participants. 
In order to do this we need to permit the race before we can officially open registration, so we are selling race registrations through the form of an official Indiegogo project in order to get the funding for permitting! Once we reach the end of the Indiegogo project, we will permit our race based on our funding, and open up official registration, course, and everything else!
Once official registration has opened, all project backers will receive 1 free registration code to register for the race!
The race will still be an official training run for the Columbus marathon. Race date will be October 4th!
Want to in a free ""Broke Man in training"" shirt?? Share your registration on your social media networks and let me know you did so. We will be picking one winner a week through the month of January to win! 
Risks and challenges
A good race comes with a solid budget, that offers additions and subtractions. Outside of the basic necessities, there are a lot of ways to put on a good race on a lower budget.
Once the project is funded we will have great projected budget to determine how we can build the race with that specific budget.

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Why Mental Health?</h3> <p>Over the past few years, mental health services in Chicago have been slashed as part of budget cuts.  The tragedy of this is that many who suffer from mental illness can have happy and healthy lives if they get the support services they need.  <a href=""http://www.trilogyinc.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Trilogy</a> is a non-profit here that's doing its best in the face of these cuts to help the people who need it.  </p>
<p>Many of my closest friends suffer from mental illness and I've seen how getting the proper care has made a huge difference in their lives.  I've seen the struggles that they've gone through day to day, and how small changes can make a big difference for them.  So I'm hoping that with this effort, collectively, we can make a difference for a few other people here in Chicago. </p>

<p>I'll be travelling to Japan, Thailand, Turkey, the Czech Republic, Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France.  </p>
<p><b>What will my photo be a picture of?</b><br/></p>
<p>Honestly, I have no idea.  My plan is to take a ton of photos and try to find a good collection of photos that I think people will like.  From that collection I will print out one copy of each photo, sign it, and then send it to you.  Then, once you receive your photo, I'll delete my copy of the image.  Gone.  Forever.</p>
<p>Basically I'm thinking of these photos as post cards.  So odds are it will be a photo of some architecture, or a nice landscape.  It might be of some people on the street, depending on what takes my interest at the time.   </p>
<p><b>How will you choose which photo to send to me?</b></p>
<p>I'll assemble the collection of photos, and then pick who gets what without any reference to their name, etc.  So nobody is getting preferential selections unless they choose the ""Dibs!"" level.  If somebody buys that, then they get to choose first from the collection.  Otherwise, it's whatever the fates decide.</p>
<p><b>What if I don't like the photo that's been chosen for me?</b></p>
<p>Sorry about that.  You gave money to a good cause, though so at least you have that warm fuzzy feeling to savor while you throw my photo in the trash.  </p>
<p><b>What if I wanted to have another copy of the photo?</b></p>
<p>Well I won't be able to make you a copy, so if you want to scan it in, etc, I'm not going to stop you.  If you posted a copy of it to your facebook or twitter to say, ""look at this cool photo I got"", that'd be fine too.  If you want to get into the legalese, it would be Creative Commons licensed as ""<a href=""https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike</a><b>""</b>.</p>
<p><b>What if I don't want you to destroy the copies?</b></p>
<p>If you are okay with me keeping a copy of your photo, that's great!  Just send me a comment to let me know that's what you want.  Just bear in mind that if you say I can keep it, that means I can do anything I want with it.  If you don't tell me otherwise, your copy will definitely be the only one.  </p>
<p><b>What if you are eaten by one of the famed photographer eating bears of the Czech Republic?</b></p>
<p>What I promise to you is to make a best effort to pull this off.  I'll be hauling a bunch of technology around the planet, and there's always the chance that something is just going to die on me.  My camera might stop working, a memory card might lose its memory, or I could be eaten by one of those pesky bears.  I'm trying to do this to raise money for a good cause, and that's really the point here.  I will make a best effort to ensure you get the photo.  </p>
<p><b>How much of my money will go to the charity?</b></p>
<p>I am planning to cover all of the printing costs of the photos, so other than the cut that Indeigogo takes for hosting this effort, all of the money will go directly to Trilogy.  Your payment will be handled by FirstGiving, Indiegogo's partner for handling payments to charities.  </p>

It does, however, work in a very similar manner to the way a car jack lifts up a car one click at a time when a car has a flat tire. The harness has two jacks, one on each side that can be jacked up until back pain relief is felt, usually in a matter of seconds. </p><p>Vertebrae discs are also similar to a flat tire. As gravity, normal wear and tear or sports/work injuries cause the vertebrae to put too much pressure on vertebral discs, they sometimes begin to bulge or actually rupture just like a flat tire blow out. Just as a flat tire bulges out when it lays flat the ground, a ruptured disc bulges and puts pressure on the spinal cord nerve centers, which causes a wide variety of lower back pain. Similar to driving on the rim of a flat tire, it causes sparks and lots of friction. These sparks are what causes most types of lower back pain. </p><p>When the VerteCore Lift ""jacks up"" or stretches out the spinal column, it allows the ruptured disc to heal itself just like sealing a flat tire and re-inflating it with air. Instead of allowing the grinding of adjacent vertebrae, discs, or nerves, this decompression process enables a natural healing as it separates the grinding elements, and reduces pressure being placed on spinal nerve roots. Relief is immediate and can be initiated by wearing the ""Lift"" for only 20-minutes a day during normal daily activities. </p><h4 style=""text-align: center;"">How Spinal Decompression Treats Herniated Discs</h4><div>

<h3><b><u>VerteCore Lift: What Back Pain Does It Treat?</u></b></h3>
<p>Bulging or Herniated Discs, Sciatica, Functional Scoliosis, S I Joint Disfunction, Stable Spondylolisthesis or Degenerative Disc Disease. If any of the above applies to you or a loved one, then this product was created to make your life better and give you immediate back pain relief! </p>
<p>And unlike other back pain devices sold on TV that require laying down or hanging upside down, which causes blood to rush to your head, our VerteCore Lift is easy to put on and can be worn while running errands or even lite exercise, all at your own convenience - no doctor visits required.</p>
<p>Adding mobility to spinal decompression is a critical product development. Not only does it stretch out the spine allowing the vertebrae discs to return to their normal positions, but wearing it during activity increases the effectiveness of the body’s circulatory system which speeds ups the body’s ability to heal itself naturally.</p>

<h3><b style=""background-color: initial;""><u>VerteCore Lift: Fulfillment Center</u></b></h3>
<p>We have signed an agreement with a leading fulfillment and distribution center, Brilliant Fulfillment, based in Carrolton, Texas. Once this crowdfunding campaign concludes Brilliant Fulfillment's call center will begin to accepting orders from back pain patients, medical professionals, spine treatment centers and medical device retailers and resellers at (888) 928-LIFT.</p>
<h3><b><u>VerteCore Lift: Join Our Sales Team</u></b></h3>
<p>Our next step is to build a nationwide sales team to begin a grass roots sales movement to sell the VerteCore Lift to lower back pain treatment facilities throughout the United States first, and then the rest of the world. Soon we will be seeking 20 sales reps in every state throughout the United States.<br/><br/>People who purchase one of the VerteCore Lift will receive not only immediate back pain relief, but have a chance to introduce this spinal decompression medical device to local chiropractors, medical doctors and spine treatment centers in their state. Once you try on your first VerteCore Lift, you will feel immediately why they will become best sellers.  If you haven't done so, <b><a href=""https://vertecorelift.wordpress.com/videos/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Please Watch our Product Demonstration Videos</a> </b>to see for yourself!</p>
<h3><b><u>VerteCore Lift: Why Will They Be Easy to Sell?</u></b></h3>
<p>Right now there are only a few ways to treat lower back pain: exercise, pain medications, spinal traction and back surgery. Many people that have chronic back pain cease to be active and gain a lot weight. Therefore, exercising for many is simply not a option due to pain and excessive weight. </p>
<p>Prescribing pain medication is also common, but America's addiction to pain medications is a growing epidemic. </p>
<p>Spinal decompression medical equipment is very expensive, takes up a lot of space and it time consuming to operate. </p>
<p>The last option is invasive back surgery, which doesn't always get rid of the back pain. </p>
<p>The VerteCore Lift is small, lightweight and can be stored in most medicine cabinets. Yet, for its small foot print, it can yield substantial extra revenue for a medical practice by purchasing a single device. </p>
<p>If a practitioner charges $100 per 20 minute session x 5 sessions per day x 20 business days per month, with a single VerteCore Lift, an M.D. or Chiropractor could add $10,000 per month/$120,000 per year in gross revenue to their medical practice.  </p>
<p>Not bad for a medical device that retails for only $599. And, at a sales price of $299, it would only take 3 patient visits to pay off the purchase price. And, for doctors with a large medical practice, <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/vertecore-lift-receive-instant-back-pain-relief/payments/new?perk_id=3491642"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>purchasing the Doctor's Dozen Package Perk for $3,000 will generate a substantial Return on Investment</b></a> or approximately an extra $1,440,000 in gross revenue per year.  </p>
<p>Hard to argue mathematically with investing $3,000 for 12 units that will pay themselves off with only 30 patient visits and then generate more than $1 million per year. Over a 10-year period, why not add an extra $10 million in revenue??</p>
<p>For people interested in adding the VerteCore Lift to your medical device sales portfolio, we have included a sales commission chart below that highlights the highly profitable sales margins that can be generated by selling just 100 units per month.  And yes, anyone that has a desire to sell them can earn this type of money by picking up the phone and scheduling appointments with local doctors and chiropractors. </p>

The great news is, by overcoming those challenges, we've also eliminated the majority of the risks. </p>
<p>As previously mentioned, November(2016) was to be our first month for large quantity shipping; however, we will now begin shipping on a first purchased basis much sooner. Some early orders were already delivered in July and Early August. We will accelerate that schedule for all orders (large and small) as much as possible and hope to surprise everybody a little early.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hello everyone my name is Travis Hamlin, I am thirty one years old and live in Bakersfield CA. Proudly, I am engaged to an all around beautiful woman, who has blessed me with an amazing daughter. I have the best mother a guy could ask for and two older sisters whom I love dearly.Being a family man, I have mostly worked with and for my father until his death in 2008. Recently I have been working for a furniture company and have been a top writer in sales. This new job requires me to work weekends, holidays and just about all the time. Working for someone else has been a great opportunity but doesn't give me much family time. So for the past four years I have been working with my cousin to try and build a better career working for ourselves and carry on a new family business.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>VentSense has been a ongoing project for the last four years of my life. I have spent every extra dollar and spent every extra minute of the day working on this project. I've brought in family and friends who also truly believe in this product and have put in their all as well. VentSense to us means working with the people who matter most, your family. Nothing gives me a greater feeling than to provide for the ones I love and to know they are taken care of. VentSense is also an eco-friendly product, using no additional electricity, flames or aerosols to scent your home.</li>
<li>Achieving this goal with the help of all our supporters and Indiegogo, would help a product that not only is useful but also helps the environment. Every day millions of household air fresheners are being used without any thought of the resulting environmental or health impacts. VentSense utilizes what every home or office already has; air vents. I realize we are not going to completely stop the use of our competitors’ products, our goal is to replace as many of these harmful products as we can. With your help I truly believe we can make a large impact on the air freshener industry and the way we all freshen our homes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>VentSense is a patent pending product, the logo is registered and we have our website up and running. We have done the research and product development, started a marketing campaign and partnered with likeminded individuals to see this product through. Our manufacturer is ready to start our first production run of 25,000 units. We have one small problem, the $50,000 that we need to begin production. With your help we can keep this project moving full speed ahead and bring this product to the masses.</li>
<li>We feel the best way to raise this money is to give you the supporters what you really want, the product itself. There are a few smaller perks of course, but a majority will include at least a 3 pack of one of our fresh scents mailed directly to your home. Each VentSense air freshener will give you up to 30 days of freshness, thats a total of 90 days of fresh scented air.</li>
<li>$50,000 is our goal, but there is the chance we may not reach that goal. Any of the funds collected from this campaign will go straight to our manufacturer to purchase the amount needed to fufill the perks from our supporters. We can get the word out through you and our marketing team. With enough support we can sell our product on our website. Once we are up and running all profits will go toward making this product even more environmentally friendly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>We feel even though we don't have the ""coolest"" project around, there are enough forward thinking individuals who will appreciate the convenience and environmental benefits of this project. Let's face it, there are some major issues with air freshener products currently on the market:</li>
<li>Paraffin candles account for 90% of all candle sales. Paraffin is derived from crude oil which generates a substantial eco-footprint.</li>
<li>Plugins; using a minimal figure of twenty million units, being used for one year, results in a total energy usage equal to1/8 the output of a 500 megawatt coal-fired power plant or 612,000 barrels of oil.</li>
<li>In 2008, Anne Steinman at the University of Washington published a study of top selling air fresheners. She found that all products tested gave off chemicals regulated as toxic or hazardous under federal laws, including carcinogens with no safe exposure level.</li>
</ul>

Hello everyone my name is Travis Hamlin, I am thirty one years old and live in Bakersfield CA. Proudly, I am engaged to an all around beautiful woman, who has blessed me with an amazing daughter. I have the best mother a guy could ask for and two older sisters whom I love dearly.Being a family man, I have mostly worked with and for my father until his death in 2008. Recently I have been working for a furniture company and have been a top writer in sales. This new job requires me to work weekends, holidays and just about all the time. Working for someone else has been a great opportunity but doesn't give me much family time. So for the past four years I have been working with my cousin to try and build a better career working for ourselves and carry on a new family business.


VentSense has been a ongoing project for the last four years of my life. I have spent every extra dollar and spent every extra minute of the day working on this project. I've brought in family and friends who also truly believe in this product and have put in their all as well. VentSense to us means working with the people who matter most, your family. Nothing gives me a greater feeling than to provide for the ones I love and to know they are taken care of. VentSense is also an eco-friendly product, using no additional electricity, flames or aerosols to scent your home.
Achieving this goal with the help of all our supporters and Indiegogo, would help a product that not only is useful but also helps the environment. Every day millions of household air fresheners are being used without any thought of the resulting environmental or health impacts. VentSense utilizes what every home or office already has; air vents. I realize we are not going to completely stop the use of our competitors’ products, our goal is to replace as many of these harmful products as we can. With your help I truly believe we can make a large impact on the air freshener industry and the way we all freshen our homes.

What We Need & What You Get

VentSense is a patent pending product, the logo is registered and we have our website up and running. We have done the research and product development, started a marketing campaign and partnered with likeminded individuals to see this product through. Our manufacturer is ready to start our first production run of 25,000 units. We have one small problem, the $50,000 that we need to begin production. With your help we can keep this project moving full speed ahead and bring this product to the masses.
We feel the best way to raise this money is to give you the supporters what you really want, the product itself. There are a few smaller perks of course, but a majority will include at least a 3 pack of one of our fresh scents mailed directly to your home. Each VentSense air freshener will give you up to 30 days of freshness, thats a total of 90 days of fresh scented air.
$50,000 is our goal, but there is the chance we may not reach that goal. Any of the funds collected from this campaign will go straight to our manufacturer to purchase the amount needed to fufill the perks from our supporters. We can get the word out through you and our marketing team. With enough support we can sell our product on our website. Once we are up and running all profits will go toward making this product even more environmentally friendly.

The Impact

We feel even though we don't have the ""coolest"" project around, there are enough forward thinking individuals who will appreciate the convenience and environmental benefits of this project. Let's face it, there are some major issues with air freshener products currently on the market:
Paraffin candles account for 90% of all candle sales. Paraffin is derived from crude oil which generates a substantial eco-footprint.
Plugins; using a minimal figure of twenty million units, being used for one year, results in a total energy usage equal to1/8 the output of a 500 megawatt coal-fired power plant or 612,000 barrels of oil.
In 2008, Anne Steinman at the University of Washington published a study of top selling air fresheners. She found that all products tested gave off chemicals regulated as toxic or hazardous under federal laws, including carcinogens with no safe exposure level.

<p><b>The Impact </b></p>
<p>Hey guys, thanks for taking the time! </p>
<p>Welcome to my quest to raise money for top surgery – also known in the world as a whole slew of things like double mastectomy, gender reassignment surgery, the big chop, etc., etc. </p>
<p>But let’s start with a little background info, shall we? I, like most people, have had many relationships with my body over the years. I’ve worked super hard to change the things I can change (some of which I talk about on my extremely awesome blog, <a href=""http://mandatainstalling.tumblr.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>mandatainstalling.tumblr.com</span></a>), and have worked even harder to come to terms with the stuff I can’t. Recently, I’ve been working on realizing that there are some things I can't change on my own, but may actually be able to change with some help. I’ve taken the first step with this – starting testosterone injections (imma be a bear! rawr!). The next step, the harder one to access, is the one change I have wanted consistently since I was very small – no more boobs. On me, that is (other peoples' are great!). I feel like my body has always been in agreement with me on this, as it has given me 15+ years of posture/sports bra/muscle development-related chronic back pain to hammer the point home.</p>
<p>All sounds clear so far, yeah? To summarize the problem: gender and pain-related desire to free myself of these fleshy sacks. Solution? Ftm top surgery. </p>
<p>And so we come to the crux of the issue: m-o-n-e-y. Yes, I live in Canada, the land of the health care, which we gloatingly hold over the heads of Americans. And yes, it is an accessible thing here for some people to get ftm top surgery covered by the government – but only for some, and only after going through an often ridiculously-demoralizing and quite (years) long process of fitting into very specific ideas of what a ‘man’ is. </p>
<p>Which brings me to another thing I should mention. A super happy thing (that a lot of you know about already) – I’m getting married next year! HURRAY! On May 21st, 2014 I will be entering yet another new phase of life, a government recognized relationship status! What an eye-opening thing, getting engaged. I’m not someone who held a lot of stake in getting legally married, but I won’t lie, it all changes when you find someone you wanna do it with. And then you starting thinking about all of these things, like who you want to be when standing across the altar from someone. For me, a big part of that is being a boobless person. </p>
<p><b>What I Need &amp; What You Get </b></p>
<p>All this to say (beyond feeling like this is the time to make the changes I want in life), I don’t have 2+ years to wait for the powers that be to decide that I’m sufficiently ‘man enough’ to deserve government help in accessing top surgery. </p>
<p>I’m generally not very good at asking for help. I’ve gone through unhealthily long periods of time holding onto my emotional and physical malnourishment because my pride has prevented me from asking for what I need. I’ve also waited many years to start making these changes, for that same reason. But here I am, changing my ways, being a new me (that alter-worthy person, and a person beyond that as well) who is willing to ask for help when I need it. And, friends, I need your help. </p>
<p>So my quest – raise $8000 bucks. The breakdown of which is: </p>
<p>Doctor’s fee for surgery: $6500<br/>
Taxes: $845<br/>
Indiegogo fee: $293.80 - 661.05<br/>
Total: $8006.05<br/><br/>
Now, I don’t expect you to just give me money with nothing in return. One upside of my excessive pride is that it has lead me to try to be super self-sufficient, which means another good thing – while I might not have money, I HAVE SKILLS! Lots of them. All of which I am super excited about offering up for much less than I usually do in hopes of making it a little easier for you help me out! What are some of those skills? Glad you asked...</p>
<p>For one, I’m pretty adept with a camera – hell, it’s what I do for a living. So, do you need some new head shots? Got it covered. Wanna surprise someone special with a dirty magazine staring you (the holidays are coming!)? I can do that too. Fan of the moving image? Yep. But my skills don’t stop there, I have a pretty hefty arsenal of graphic design and website building magic too. Do you need a new online identity? Website? Branding? Yep yep yep. I also make art, which will be available for those of you who don’t wanna think of something else to do on your own. AND for those of you who are like me and may be struggling financially but still want to help (appreciated!), I will be making man_data installing apparel – t-shirt &amp; tank tops, screen printed by me! There are many ways to help out and to also get something awesome for yourself (no need for altruism here, although it won’t be rejected). Check out the list for all the different ways, big or small, in which I can help you acquire something cool and relevant in exchange for you helping me complete this quest. </p>
<p>Also worth noting: it’s my birthday at the end of January, which is conveniently (or totally intentionally) close to when this campaign will end. What a bday present! </p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help </b></p>
<p>I know money’s a hard thing for many of us, and there are a lot of other currencies in the world. If you wanna help in ways that aren’t financial, consider sharing this around to folks – it helps a ton! And, conveniently, Indiegogo has a lot of built-in share tools for you to use in order to do just that! </p><br/><p></p></div>","The Impact

<h3>My Story.</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Liam. I am transgender FTM. That means I was assigned female at birth, but I identify as male. I went through female puberty and that resulted in breasts that I have always hated. I feel very detached from my own body. My video above is one I made for a class I was taking. It describes the dysphoria i feel with my own body when i'm constantly trying to get rid of my chest. I bind my chest down daily, but this often results in a lot of back and chest pain. I am looking forward to being able to have top surgery to permanently fix this problem and make me feel comfortable in my own skin. I have applied to every job opening in my area but because I go to school full-time, it has been hard to find a job that hires employees that can only work weekends. This makes it very hard to save money, since I have no income. I have about $3000 right now dedicated towards my top surgery, but this gets me a little less than halfway there. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

than 80% of cancers now occur outside of the EU and USA, putting a massive
strain on the individuals that can afford it least. <span><br/></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><span><br/></span><a href=""www.alemhealth.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""www.alemhealth.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">AlemHealth</a> is on a mission to
provide world-class diagnoses to hard to reach communities. We link doctors in
local hospitals to international experts, giving patients access to early and
accurate diagnosis.<span><br/></span></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span>Since we opened our Kabul office</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">, the majority of patients we have seen
are women and many of them have symptoms of breast cancer. Over 30% of the
mammograms our experts read present advanced cancers, which indicates that this
disease may be much more prevalent than anyone realised. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>We want to act now to
stop breast cancer by providing at risk-women with the screenings and
information they need.

isn’t commonplace in Afghanistan; people go to the doctor once they’re very
sick and nearly every cancer case doctors in our network see is late stage,
limiting the treatment options available to patients. We want to change that,
and help patients get the preventative screening that can change their lives
through early diagnosis.<span><br/></span></span><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;""><span><br/></span>Being a start-up, we don’t

making this possible.</span>

Early and accurate breast cancer screening for women in Afghanistan. We're launching a non-profit initiative - Cancer Counts - because we believe access to healthcare should be determined by need, not location. We want to provide screening mammograms to at-risk women, who would otherwise not be able to afford them, and build awareness on the importance of preventative screening. We need your help to provide 200 at-risk women in Kabul with 200 mammograms.

Cancer counts won't stop thereThis initiative will kick-start
awareness raising and give women access to the medical care they need.  We’re doing our part to raise
cancer awareness in Afghanistan, working with hospitals, doctors and
non-profits to provide women with information to make decisions about their
health. Furthermore, pending the results of the scans, we have
partnerships with non-profit organisations that will help find treatment for
women affected by cancer. 

This is an amazing opportunity to
cost-effectively raise the quality of care available to women in Afghanistan
and give them healthcare they need.

How it works

The best part about our programme is that all the pieces are already in place, it’s all set up and ready to go. This is how we work:We have the mammography machines at our
partner facilities, hundreds of women’s health doctors using our services, and
a doctor network throughout the world numbering nearly 1,000 ready to read the
images.We've developed innovative technology, the AlemBox, to link doctors in Afghanistan to experts in the USA, UK and India.  Check out Nvidia's article on us. 
Every dollar you provide goes directly to cover the costs of the mammograms for at-risk women. No overheads like Landcruisers and six-figure salaries, no setup costs and logistics. No wastage, no leakage, just pure impact.

strain on the individuals that can afford it least. AlemHealth is on a mission to
provide world-class diagnoses to hard to reach communities. We link doctors in
local hospitals to international experts, giving patients access to early and
accurate diagnosis.Since we opened our Kabul office, the majority of patients we have seen
are women and many of them have symptoms of breast cancer. Over 30% of the
mammograms our experts read present advanced cancers, which indicates that this
disease may be much more prevalent than anyone realised. We want to act now to
stop breast cancer by providing at risk-women with the screenings and
information they need. 


Why now, why here?Preventative healthcare
isn’t commonplace in Afghanistan; people go to the doctor once they’re very
sick and nearly every cancer case doctors in our network see is late stage,
limiting the treatment options available to patients. We want to change that,
and help patients get the preventative screening that can change their lives
through early diagnosis.Being a start-up, we don’t
have the funds to give out free scans, and nor would we want to – we are about
creating a sustainable enterprise in frontier markets – however we do want to
see people in need get treatment in a timely manner.The Cancer Counts initiative is our way of
making this possible.



Let's make this happen

We are doing this for breast
cancer awareness. We are doing it for women in Afghanistan. And we are doing
this with your help.
Tell your friends, family and anyone who will listen that cancer counts
everywhere, and together we can make a difference. 
The reward will be amazing and the
impact you’ll make is potentially life saving. 
Don’t forget to use #CancerCounts
to spread the word.

<div>In 2008, Elyjah Zakai M. (nickname is Zak) was a normal four year old boy who enjoyed swimming, running and playing with his brothers.  He would become winded and tired - not to mention the one occasion where his extremities turned a light blue from poor circulation.  Not knowing what was the cause, we took Zak and his brothers to a pediatric cardiologist after a murmur was detected.  What we were told changed our lives forever.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>""Don't blame yourself when he dies.""  ""You couldn't have done anything to prevent this.""  ""I have never seen a heart this thick."" </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Zak was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  His heart walls were three sizes too thick and the pumping ability was severely restricted.  The disease was handed down by his father, who had already lost two sisters and a mother to the same disease (though, at the time, was referred to by a different name: IHSS).  He himself had been diagnosed as well, but was told ""the girls have it worse"" so it was ignored.  Zak was no longer able to run.  He was told never to participate in any sporting activities for fear of cardiac arrest.  We moved to Houston, TX (from El Paso, TX) to be seen by the worlds best pediatric cardiologist and were told the same thing - his heart was ridiculously thick and it looked like Zak would probably progress past the ""norm"" and fall into the 5% who wound up in endstage (heart failure). </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Today, Zak is eight years old.  His heart is getting thicker and he is now experiencing heart failure symptoms.  He is unable to walk without becoming winded.  He cannot play like he used to.  Stairs are no longer an option.  He needs additional medication, but cannot receive any until he gets an ICD implanted.  His father is also very ill, and Zak is having to travel between the ICU and home while keeping a positive attitude at what very well may be his own future.</div>
<h3>This is what we need to do:</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need to get Zak an ICD.  To do this, we need a $250 deductible, plus 10% of the surgery costs ($5000)</li>
<li>We will need gas and food to travel, and stay, at Texas Children's Hospital.  We live 45 minutes away. ($200)</li>
<li>We will need the doctor copay before and after surgery for pre and post implant. ($200)</li>
<li>We will need a trip to Ohio to see the experts in HCM care should Zak need more invasive procedures (such as a myectomy or a heart transplant).</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<h3>This is why:</h3>
<div>
<p>Zak has lost a grandmother, two aunts and nearly his father to this awful disease.  We need to get him an ICD to help manage these problems before his heart becomes worse.  There is no cure for HCM, but our hope is to allow Zak to be as healthy as possible for as long as possible...

<p> </p>
<p>We started with pediatric Buzzy®, a palm-sized device combining vibration and cold to relieve sharp pain on contact in seconds.  Frozen ice wings are attached to Buzzy®, which is then attached with a tourniquet “between the brain and the pain”.  Just like putting a burn under cold water blocks pain, sensations of burning, sticking, or itching are relieved on contact by Buzzy’s physiologic nerve blockade.  Like a dentist jiggling a jaw, Buzzy® interrupts pain from needles, IV attempts, burning medications, or stings.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We’ve been making Buzzy in China and have been adopted by over 400 hospitals and 1000 clinics.  The problems are that healthcare providers don’t always care about pain – Buzzy needs to be available to anyone to take with them anytime.  The physiology of Buzzy works for adults, too, but people have been confused by the kid-friendly bee design.  We’d like to make a more discreet one for adults and kids that doesn’t need a tourniquet, fits better into the hand, is stronger, and is MADE IN AMERICA!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To make a new Buzzy in the US, we will need about $72,000 for new steel tools for manufacturing, and about $110,000 to purchase the minimum order to get a company interested.  We’ve gotten loans and used our home equity loan, and got a small grant from the Pediatric Device initiatives, but are short $60,000 towards the tooling.  Any amount will be put to the tooling goal to speed things up: otherwise, we have to wait until we bootstrap more through sales.  We WILL make a new Buzzy, it’s just frustratingly slow.  The retail price of the Buzzy used in hospitals is $40; for anyone who contributes a minimum of $30, we’ll send you one of the new Buzzies to help you or anyone you know who hates shots or the burning, stinging sensation of injected medicines for arthritis, fertility treatments, multiple sclerosis, Crohn’s disease, psoriasis… the list goes on and on!  Donate $20 and we'll send you a set of 6 of our Bravery Badges stickers, and donate $100 and we'll send you a Deluxe kit with our current tourniquet Buzzy!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It’s important to me that this not be disposable: people need to be able to count on Buzzy being there for them for any painful procedure and not have to buy something over and over.   We’ve got enough medical cost and waste in our country.  Given our mission of reusable, inexpensive products for personal pain control, we avoided VC investment insisting on disposable and higher-end hospital products. Instead, we have bootstrapped development.  In the three years since we launched our striped bee-shaped Buzzy® we have established scientific credibility through publications and winning the Medical Design Excellence Award in 2011, but it’s tough to grow as fast as we need to help everyone we can given my desire to bring jobs to the US.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our biggest successes have been personal: a grandfather decided not to quit dialysis because of Buzzy; a woman terrified of conception because of needlephobia uses Buzzy and now is pregnant; a family was torn apart by three-hour arthritis injection dramas that Buzzy made a 5-minute non-issue.   We have testimonials for everything from arthritis shots to eczema itching to splinter removal pain.  No one likes pain; why not make healthcare and first aid more comfortable?

<p><i>I must say thank you to Blossum Mask for their new invention. It just means I can give my lecture with my homemade mask on in the safe knowledge that I can talk to my students. I have another one in here already prepared for my next course so it means I don’t have to be walking around with my bag full of masks or throw any away. So thank you very much Blossum Mask.</i> <strong>Sam - English University Lecturer</strong></p>
<p><i>Just a quick message about Blossum Mask Bag. This little pouch changed my life. Instead of taking a full box of disposable masks when I travel to Paris for business every week,  I just need to take 2 and this Blossum Mask Bag. Then I can respect the rules. That’s it ! Easy, compact, I highly recommend it.</i> <strong>Pierre-Yves - French Business traveller </strong></p>

<h2>Blossum &amp; Totem tech Story</h2>
<h3>Use technology to support well-being and health - each and every day</h3>
<p><strong>The Blossum Mask Bag is the result of a Franco-Taiwanese collaboration.</strong></p>
<p>We constantly think about what society and people need using the skills and experience available within our team. In late March 2020, the situation was getting very serious, masks and other PPE were in big shortage. As we had experience making heating products before (Totem Tech) &amp; anti-pollution masks (Blossum), we came up with this idea of using heat to clean masks. </p>
<p><strong>The original idea was to extend the use time of each mask &amp; to store it in a safe place between use.</strong></p>
<p> </p>

Clean and Reuse your masks - Simply
Blossum Mask Bag is a textile heating bag, the size of a purse. When connected to a power source, the heat enables to clean the masks that have been worn. Blossum Mask Bag can be used with both disposable and fabric masks. 
 
 
How It Works 
Simple, Quick & Effective
 
       
Benefits 
 

 
Anyone, Anywhere, Anytime can clean the masks they've been wearing. The Blossum Mask Bag can be taken anywhere, plugged into a powerbank, a cigarette lighter, a computer or a power socket.  
 

 
Using heat, at 70°C-158°F for 60 minutes, the Blossum Mask Bag cleans the masks from elements which do not survive at high temperatures. 
 

 
Disposable masks, which are widely used, are composed of more than 90% plastic and take up to 500 years to decompose. Reducing their consumption is becoming a challenge for waste management on our planet. Cleaning masks with heat also reduces the number of wash cycles for fabric masks.   
 

 
All masks can be used in the Blossum Mask Bag including disposable masks. After heating cycle, you will be able to reuse your mask. With the Blossum Mask Bag, save money by reducing your mask budget.

Here are what the beta users think about their experience :

 
I must say thank you to Blossum Mask for their new invention. It just means I can give my lecture with my homemade mask on in the safe knowledge that I can talk to my students. I have another one in here already prepared for my next course so it means I don’t have to be walking around with my bag full of masks or throw any away. So thank you very much Blossum Mask. Sam - English University Lecturer
Just a quick message about Blossum Mask Bag. This little pouch changed my life. Instead of taking a full box of disposable masks when I travel to Paris for business every week,  I just need to take 2 and this Blossum Mask Bag. Then I can respect the rules. That’s it ! Easy, compact, I highly recommend it. Pierre-Yves - French Business traveller 
I’ve been using the Blossum Mask Bag for more than 7 days now and I am very satisfied with it. I use it when I need to clean my mask after wearing it for a while. Very good product. I recommend it to everyone. Arnaud - French Real estate agent
When you also travel as much as we do, there is one thing you must have in your backpack - the Blossum Mask Bag. It doesn’t just save you money, you also do something good for the environment. So what are you waiting for ? Flynn - German Backpacker
I am currently working in Taipei and take the metro everyday. I have tested Blossum Mask Bag, it helps me to save my mask in a clean and safe place. I feel it is a great product. Julie - Taiwanese metro user
Hi, I am Pablo, bar owner. We have been using lots of masks. But we have been trying the Blossum Mask Bag for a week, it truly is a money saver and it is also better for the planet. Pablo - Chilean bar owner
 
Blossum & Totem tech Story
Use technology to support well-being and health - each and every day
The Blossum Mask Bag is the result of a Franco-Taiwanese collaboration.
We constantly think about what society and people need using the skills and experience available within our team. In late March 2020, the situation was getting very serious, masks and other PPE were in big shortage. As we had experience making heating products before (Totem Tech) & anti-pollution masks (Blossum), we came up with this idea of using heat to clean masks. 
The original idea was to extend the use time of each mask & to store it in a safe place between use.
 
The Team
An international team with their own specific competencies


 
Rewards

 
IMPORTANT : Our products are set to go through certification for commercial release in the US, Canada and European countries requiring FCC or CE certification at this stage. Therefore, we can only ship to these locations. We sincerely apologize if your country is not listed yet, but ultimately we will open to more countries. To the rest of the world, we are coming soon.
 
Next Steps 

Why Indiegogo and What if we raise more than the initial goal ?
This Indiegogo pre-sales campaign will allow us to start mass production.
At this stage we have invested in R&D, patent, certification & effectiveness testings. Our products are set to go through certification for commercial release in the US, Canada and European countries requiring FCC or CE certification.
Therefore, if we raise more than the initial goal, we will start asap additional certifications to be compliant with Asian norms and in a second step develop a colour collection of Blossum Mask Bags.
 
Risks & Challenges
Parts and suppliers are already in place and a trial manufacture has been conducted. Once the mass production begins right after the campaign is over, we will work closely with the factory to ensure that production is at capacity to minimize any possible risk of delay. However, it is important to understand that unexpected things may happen along the way, which are very hard to predict now. For example, delays in shipping can occur due to external factors  such as travel restrictions.So we feel that the risks of us not delivering a great working product as shown above, are close to zero.

At Glimmer 411® we focus on ensuring every client has what we didn’t: easy access to the tools and information needed to feel empowered in their hair journey! Glimmer 411® is completely self-funded but this campaign will give us, a black-owned and female-led business, independence from other external funding sources that could dilute our company’s foundational and early-stage goals:
Easy access for all
Meaningful representation 
Industry reeducation
Centralization of information

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>But wait you say, you're Tara Emory, you're PERFECT in your photos! oh my god don't change!!  NoOOOooOOOOO!!!
</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, yes, why thank you for believing everything you see in my very
 selective photos.  And though i use photoshop to a minimum (and try to 
not misrepresent myself), please don't judge the real me by own photos.</li>
<li>There's two very distinct ways you can look at the argument for more surgery.<br/>First off, we can take the frivilous approach. </li>
<li>To all you you fans who have been following my career, you probably 
have noticed that i have taken a shift towards the plastic, embracing my
 own talents to be a living cartoon doll.  Getting some light facial 
surgery done around my eyes and forehead will only enhance that image, 
and push my career and my own fetishes further, and to you the consumer,
 that's a good thing, isn't it.  Yes,  you want to see me go further 
down this rabbit hole!  <br/><br/>Also, please be assured that i have a 
very very clear idea of what exactly I want done, and how they won't 
actually take the personality out of my face or change the way I look 
that much.  I am very targeted with my goals of only smoothing out the 
sharp edges and taking what I have, and making it look even better.<br/><br/>But
 the flip side to this is very simple.  I still have a hairline of a 
boy, and hormones only did so much to fix that, limiting my natural 
hairstyles.  Though for my professional persona I wear lots of different
 wigs, my natural look could use some help, and the solution is facial 
feminization surgery.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact of this will help my career, my destiny and actually my 
self esteem as I will be able to do a lot more with my natural hair than
 I have previously done.  I've actually never been to a hair salon, 
though pixie hairstyle cuts work well on me.  Add to that my improved 
image for my modelling career and my current direction, then it's a 
win/win.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since my visage and my art are popular with the public, it seems 
only fitting to ask the public for help, since it is the public who will
 be the ones who will enjoy the end results as seen in my photographic 
and modelling art.</li>
<li>Also, I know there are fans out there who have seen me and wondered 
how they could best further my career so I can take it further and 
further to new heights.  This is the best thing you can do for me and 
quite literally one of the very few things I want in life!</li>

</ul><br/></div>","Hi, I'm Tara Emory, a transgendered woman who is  model and adult actress, self made 
artist, pin up girl and burlesque performer.  I know it is almost cliche
 to say that my body is my canvas, but for me it is really is true. If 
you don't know me, do a little search for my name and you'll see a 
sampling of my talents in costume design and photography. You may think this fundraiser looks familiar.  That is because it is an time extension of my original FFS kickstarter.  In that one I raised $2000 of a $9000 goal.  Since it fell short of it's $9000 goal, I have scaled the total amount back to $6000 (which is enough to cover the most important part of the surgery- the forehead/hairine/brow recontouring, leaving the rhinoplasty for another day.   $6000-$2000= $4000 which will be enough toThe $2000 I already raised in the first fundraiser is almost enough to cover a down payment on the surgery to secure a date this spring!  Thank you everyone who donated but I know I wasn't able to promote the fundraiser as much as I wanted to as I was very busy.  As it is I think a lot of people did not know about it.I'm sure that more people would have become contributors if nly they had known about it- therefore I have extended the fundraiser one more month as the same time as scaling back my goal.For more information on the surgery package I am planning, visit http://transop.com/index.php/pricing/packages  Originally I was seeking package ""B"" but I have scaled my goal back to package ""A"".  $6000 will roughly cover package A + travel costs to Guadalajara, Mexico.

I am seeking the help of interested parties helping me to perfect my
 physical image, so that my body can match up with the heights of my 
imagination.
This is not about me ""passing"", it is about surpassing,
 and synching my body image to the boundless ambitions of my 
imagination, to which I have expressed in my costume design, modelling, 
and personality.  I've come so far with some of my other surgeries 
(breast augmentation), but in so doing I missed what was probably the 
area in most need of attention, my brow and forehead.I'm seeking help from my fans and peers as i would like to get some

Well, yes, why thank you for believing everything you see in my very

There's two very distinct ways you can look at the argument for more surgery.First off, we can take the frivilous approach. 
To all you you fans who have been following my career, you probably 
have noticed that i have taken a shift towards the plastic, embracing my
 own talents to be a living cartoon doll.  Getting some light facial 
surgery done around my eyes and forehead will only enhance that image,

<p>We are now raising funds to test and optimize DRACOs against the herpesvirus family, which contains many major clinical viruses such as Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1), Herpes Simplex Virus 2 (HSV-2), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV, chickenpox and shingles virus), Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), and Kaposi's Sarcoma Herpesvirus (KSHV). <br/>If we can raise enough funding, we also hope to test and optimize DRACOs against the family of retroviruses, which includes Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Human T-Lymphotropic Virus (HTLV). </p>
<p>In principle, the DRACO approach should be effective against virtually all known viruses, or potentially even against new viruses that may appear. Join the movement to #EndTheVirus! </p>

<p>The greatest challenge has been securing funding to help DRACO research progress. It is also important to note that while DRACO is based on sound scientific principles and has yielded promising experimental results thus far, biological systems are very complex and we can offer no guarantee that DRACO research will end with a pill in a bottle for everyone. Without your help, though, we may never find out.

 Read 'Meet Todd Rider, the Man Who Maybe, Probably Cured Most of the Viruses on Earth' by Inverse.comRead 'This man's potentially huge medical breakthrough can't get funding, so he's trying something desperate' on Tech Insider.DRACOs (Double-stranded RNA Activated Caspase Oligomerizers) are broad-spectrum antiviral candidates developed by Dr. Todd Rider. They have proved safe and effective in treating ALL 18 viruses against which Dr. Rider has tested them in proof-of-concept work. Two different types of H1N1 influenza (flu), four types of rhinovirus (the common cold), two adenoviruses, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and others were among the 18 viruses that DRACOs have successfully treated in human and animal cells and in mice.Check out the published results in the peer-reviewed journal PLOS ONE.


 
We are now raising funds to test and optimize DRACOs against the herpesvirus family, which contains many major clinical viruses such as Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1), Herpes Simplex Virus 2 (HSV-2), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV, chickenpox and shingles virus), Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), and Kaposi's Sarcoma Herpesvirus (KSHV). If we can raise enough funding, we also hope to test and optimize DRACOs against the family of retroviruses, which includes Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Human T-Lymphotropic Virus (HTLV). 
In principle, the DRACO approach should be effective against virtually all known viruses, or potentially even against new viruses that may appear. Join the movement to #EndTheVirus!

End the suffering and save the lives of those with incurable viruses (i.e; HIV/ AIDS, HSV (cold sores and genital herpes), herpes zoster virus (chickenpox/shingles), HTLV, HPV, etc...

However, research on DRACOs has entered the well-known “Valley of Death"" (Source: NY Times), in which a lack of funding prevents DRACOs, and many other promising new drugs, from advancing toward human clinical trials. 
DRACOs could potentially revolutionize the treatment and prevention of viral infections, just as the development of antibiotics revolutionized the treatment and prevention of bacterial infections in the mid-20th century. 
With your help, we hope that DRACOs may ultimately end suffering and save lives of those struggling with any number of viruses.





By the process of efficiently eliminating only virus-infected cells, DRACOs may be able to permanently cure viral infections that can currently only be controlled but not cured by existing antiviral therapeutics.
When tested in human and animal cells, DRACOs have been nontoxic and effective against 18 different viruses, including rhinovirus (the common cold) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (see table below).

<h3> </h3>
<p> </p>
<h3>What is ""text neck""?</h3>
<p>Just take a look around you, how many people do you see staring down at their phones? Our modern lifestyle means we spend several hours a day with our necks bent forward and down staring at our smartphones and computer screens. By doing so, we increase the weight of our heads dramatically, causing extreme pressure on our necks. Over time, the nerves are continually put under great stress and tension, leading to significant health risks like chronic headaches, digestive issues, and spine degeneration.</p>

<h3>More than just a pain in the neck</h3>
<p>“Text neck” causes us to carry our heads out in front of us rather than over our shoulders where it belongs. This disruption in posture is connected to anxiety, fatigue, and even allergies. Excessive stress and strain on the neck and spine affects the central nervous system, which runs the entire body. If left untreated, “text neck” can cause some serious damage like IBS, onset of early arthritis, nerve damage, disc compression, loss of lung volume capacity, and more.</p>
<h3>The solution</h3>
<p>FitNeck is a unique and innovative device designed to strengthen your neck muscles and correct your posture. It helps prevent the development and advancement of “text neck.""</p>

</div></div>","FitNeck
Designed in collaboration with chiropractors, doctors, and professional sports team trainers. It's the only posture device that properly strengthens your critical neck muscles to realign your head back over your body.


 
Use FitNeck for just 1-2 min a day to prevent injury, relieve pain and fatigue caused by neck strain, reverse ""text neck,"" look better, and feel healthier!
Your neck posture is critically important to your overall wellbeing.
No exercise in the gym properly targets the stabilizer muscles in your neck which are responsible for pulling your head back over your shoulders and correcting your posture. 

FitNeck is the only home device that properly assists in performing cervical retraction. The exercise prescribed by chiropractors to strengthen key stabilizer muscles in your neck. Unlike methods that use bands, towels or balls, FitNeck's adjustable tension and hands-free use makes it easy to perform effective and safe cervical retractions.
 


 

Poor neck posture is more than just an unsexy look.
It actually leads to neck pain, headaches, fatigue, and a host of serious problems.
Normal exercise... if you can even find the time or energy... does not help. That's because there are specific neck muscles that exercise equipment does not target. These neck muscles are responsible for aligning your head above your body, allowing your spine to function properly.

 


 
Tested by doctors, chiropractors, and top sports trainers.
 

Shown above: Valerie Orsoni testing FitNeck.
We've been extensively testing and refining FitNeck over the past year. It's now ready for manufacturing. We just need your help and early support to launch FitNeck and help cure the ""text neck"" epidemic.
 
 
What is ""text neck""?
Just take a look around you, how many people do you see staring down at their phones? Our modern lifestyle means we spend several hours a day with our necks bent forward and down staring at our smartphones and computer screens. By doing so, we increase the weight of our heads dramatically, causing extreme pressure on our necks. Over time, the nerves are continually put under great stress and tension, leading to significant health risks like chronic headaches, digestive issues, and spine degeneration.

 



 
 
Who is FitNeck designed for?

The short answer, everyone!
Anyone who wants to feel and look better, have more energy, and eliminate the serious problems associated with poor neck postures.
Your neck stabilizer muscles really are that important!
FitNeck is not a magical cure-all, but it is an essential tool in correcting one of the worst problems in modern life: poor neck posture leading to dozens of undiagnosed problems.
With any exercise device, please consult a qualified chiropractor or doctor if you've had a neck injury or have any issues with your spine.
 
People who spend more than 30 minutes a day looking down at cellphones and other electronic devices can greatly benefit from FitNeck.

 
Contact sports players who need to strengthen their necks to prevent whiplash and concussion.

 
 
Anyone with back and neck pain due to poor posture.


 
Nursing women often end up with severe neck pain, headaches, and other problems due to constantly looking down at their baby. FitNeck can help you feel better and even give you more energy by preventing fatigue associated with neck strain. Follow best practices for ergonomically nursing and use FitNeck to restore your posture.

 
 
More than just a pain in the neck
“Text neck” causes us to carry our heads out in front of us rather than over our shoulders where it belongs. This disruption in posture is connected to anxiety, fatigue, and even allergies. Excessive stress and strain on the neck and spine affects the central nervous system, which runs the entire body. If left untreated, “text neck” can cause some serious damage like IBS, onset of early arthritis, nerve damage, disc compression, loss of lung volume capacity, and more.
The solution
FitNeck is a unique and innovative device designed to strengthen your neck muscles and correct your posture. It helps prevent the development and advancement of “text neck.""
 
FitNeck makes it easy!
1. Quick - Get your neck strong again with a 2 minute exercise 4x a week


No sweat, no fancy gym gear
2. Easy - It can be used everywhere

3. Effective - Research-backed results
FitNeck properly aligns the head and neck while performing the chin tuck exercises prescribed by chiropractors for injury recovery and prevention.
Academic research has shown proper use of chin tuck exercises strengthens critical stabilizer neck muscles and realigns the head back over the body.

<h3>The Temple Massager</h3>
<p>Say hello to a non-invasive, non-drug, complementary alternative to medicine device that does one wonderful thing extraordinarily well. The temple massager relaxes the facial muscles, and that’s a big deal.<br/>Corroborated anecdotal data indicates the temple massager was useful as a drug-free distractor and a calming mechanism in both post-combat and hospital settings.<br/>Fund raising will help our company with  manufacturing , data collection, donations and logistical needs so we can serve the communities of:<br/>Service members<br/>Veterans<br/>First Responders<br/>Woman's shelters</p>
<p><strong><i>Combat Army soldiers deployed to Afghanistan, Iraq and Kuwait have reported:</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“The Temple Massager was used as a natural form of combat stress relief.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Service members in recovery at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center reported:</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i> “The Temple Massager acted as a drug free distractor.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Veterans across the U.S. have reported:</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“That Temple Massager stops me from thinking and for that I am grateful.”</i></strong></p>

<h3>Background<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553032870/pp2x80cv4rx8rkfyfjle.jpg"" src=""""/>
</h3>
<p>In September of 1997, I was nearing the end of my military career as a Combat Engineer and college student and was under heavy stress. I started to develop pain in my lower jaw area, began to poke and prod at my facial muscles with my sunglasses, and decided that I needed to buy a temple massager immediately. But such a device did not exist. Realizing the potential in the product, I spent years developing a prototype and in  2008 received a patent.  As I was working on this project, the men and women I had served with were being deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. Seeing the stress they were under I hoped the Temple Massager would help them and other veterans to relax. Over the next 11 years, I gave away 2,800 of them. Now, with unprecedented stress in the workplace, we're making the Temple Massager available for everyone.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<h3><i>TMD</i></h3>
<p>What is TMD? Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are disorders that arise from problems with the occlusion (the contact between teeth), jaw joint, and surrounding facial muscles that control chewing and moving the jaw. Symptoms include: clicking/popping sounds in the jaw, jaws that get 'stuck' or 'locked' in the open- or closed-mouth position, difficulty chewing, and swelling/pain/tenderness in the face.</p>
<p>When using the Temple Massager for relieving the facial muscle tension relating to TMD it is important to use the small single massage tip and apply a small amount of non scented lotion to the skin in front of the ear to reduce and prevent skin friction irritation.</p>
<p>Focusing the massager tip close to and around the TMJ joint is most effective while letting the mouth hang open, the muscle is engaged if the mouth is closed so practice massaging while remembering to leave your jaw open and not engaged. Having your mouth open is the best way to massage into the TMJ area and under the cheek. Also massaging around the top area of the ear and around the Temple area is good too. Massaging the entire area but more specific to the area in front of the ear is best.</p>
<h3><i>Intrusive Thoughts</i></h3>
<p>The Temple Massager, as described by Doctor Mark Abramson Adjunct Professor Stanford University School of Medicine founder of the Mindfulness based stress clinic, is stimulating critical areas of the head such that the users awareness shifts from daily thoughts or intrusive thoughts to the massage and aromatherapy stimulation thus breaking a person out of reoccurring intrusive thoughts of past trauma. This bad loop memory can cause an increase of adrenaline and cortisol which are powerful stress hormones that can cause harm by keeping a person at constant vigilance or hyperawareness when they are not actually in harm’s way.</p>
<p>For a person to now have a small lightweight tool to instantly stop these intrusive reoccurring thoughts is a new way of approaching mental health. Based on thousands of years of temple massaging, aromatherapy and acupressure the Temple Massager was designed to deliver Holistic practices or also known as CAM therapy (Complimentary Alternative Medicine.) in a drug free and noninvasive manner. </p>
<p>If a person has been exposed to any trauma in life, military or not, bad stuff is bad stuff no matter who you are. You could have these reoccurring thoughts haunting you. The creator of the Temple Massager suffered from these thoughts when a fellow soldier drowned in training. He has used the Temple Massager to disrupt these reoccurring thoughts which gets you out of that mental rut.</p>
<h3><i>Headaches</i></h3>
<p>The Temple Massager was designed to relieve the user from holding up and engaging the neck, shoulders, arms and hands so you can get a personalized pressure adjusted targeted massage at little effort. Keeping the facial muscles relaxed is recommended by Dr’s to prevent and relieve facial muscle tension that can lead to tension headaches caused by stress.</p>
<p>Massaging the entire area of the side of the head is important to relieve muscle tension that can lead to tension headaches. We recommend the tri-point massage tip for this. Focusing the massage tips around the top of the ear and around the temple area is best, it is important to remember to let your mouth hang open. If you allow your jaw to hang open the facial muscles are not engaged and you will get more out of massaging a limp or not engaged muscle than keeping your mouth closed which engages the facial muscle. Breathing deep is critical as you massage. Some people including the creator of the Temple Massager who suffers from migraine headaches likes the lights out while lying down and in a quiet area.</p>

Say hello to a non-invasive, non-drug, complementary alternative to medicine device that does one wonderful thing extraordinarily well. The temple massager relaxes the facial muscles, and that’s a big deal.Corroborated anecdotal data indicates the temple massager was useful as a drug-free distractor and a calming mechanism in both post-combat and hospital settings.Fund raising will help our company with  manufacturing , data collection, donations and logistical needs so we can serve the communities of:Service membersVeteransFirst RespondersWoman's shelters
Combat Army soldiers deployed to Afghanistan, Iraq and Kuwait have reported:
“The Temple Massager was used as a natural form of combat stress relief.”
Service members in recovery at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center reported:
 “The Temple Massager acted as a drug free distractor.”
Veterans across the U.S. have reported:
“That Temple Massager stops me from thinking and for that I am grateful.”

Background

In September of 1997, I was nearing the end of my military career as a Combat Engineer and college student and was under heavy stress. I started to develop pain in my lower jaw area, began to poke and prod at my facial muscles with my sunglasses, and decided that I needed to buy a temple massager immediately. But such a device did not exist. Realizing the potential in the product, I spent years developing a prototype and in  2008 received a patent.  As I was working on this project, the men and women I had served with were being deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. Seeing the stress they were under I hoped the Temple Massager would help them and other veterans to relax. Over the next 11 years, I gave away 2,800 of them. Now, with unprecedented stress in the workplace, we're making the Temple Massager available for everyone.

The Impact
TMD
What is TMD? Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are disorders that arise from problems with the occlusion (the contact between teeth), jaw joint, and surrounding facial muscles that control chewing and moving the jaw. Symptoms include: clicking/popping sounds in the jaw, jaws that get 'stuck' or 'locked' in the open- or closed-mouth position, difficulty chewing, and swelling/pain/tenderness in the face.
When using the Temple Massager for relieving the facial muscle tension relating to TMD it is important to use the small single massage tip and apply a small amount of non scented lotion to the skin in front of the ear to reduce and prevent skin friction irritation.
Focusing the massager tip close to and around the TMJ joint is most effective while letting the mouth hang open, the muscle is engaged if the mouth is closed so practice massaging while remembering to leave your jaw open and not engaged. Having your mouth open is the best way to massage into the TMJ area and under the cheek. Also massaging around the top area of the ear and around the Temple area is good too. Massaging the entire area but more specific to the area in front of the ear is best.
Intrusive Thoughts
The Temple Massager, as described by Doctor Mark Abramson Adjunct Professor Stanford University School of Medicine founder of the Mindfulness based stress clinic, is stimulating critical areas of the head such that the users awareness shifts from daily thoughts or intrusive thoughts to the massage and aromatherapy stimulation thus breaking a person out of reoccurring intrusive thoughts of past trauma. This bad loop memory can cause an increase of adrenaline and cortisol which are powerful stress hormones that can cause harm by keeping a person at constant vigilance or hyperawareness when they are not actually in harm’s way.
For a person to now have a small lightweight tool to instantly stop these intrusive reoccurring thoughts is a new way of approaching mental health. Based on thousands of years of temple massaging, aromatherapy and acupressure the Temple Massager was designed to deliver Holistic practices or also known as CAM therapy (Complimentary Alternative Medicine.) in a drug free and noninvasive manner. 
If a person has been exposed to any trauma in life, military or not, bad stuff is bad stuff no matter who you are. You could have these reoccurring thoughts haunting you. The creator of the Temple Massager suffered from these thoughts when a fellow soldier drowned in training. He has used the Temple Massager to disrupt these reoccurring thoughts which gets you out of that mental rut.
Headaches
The Temple Massager was designed to relieve the user from holding up and engaging the neck, shoulders, arms and hands so you can get a personalized pressure adjusted targeted massage at little effort. Keeping the facial muscles relaxed is recommended by Dr’s to prevent and relieve facial muscle tension that can lead to tension headaches caused by stress.
Massaging the entire area of the side of the head is important to relieve muscle tension that can lead to tension headaches. We recommend the tri-point massage tip for this. Focusing the massage tips around the top of the ear and around the temple area is best, it is important to remember to let your mouth hang open. If you allow your jaw to hang open the facial muscles are not engaged and you will get more out of massaging a limp or not engaged muscle than keeping your mouth closed which engages the facial muscle. Breathing deep is critical as you massage. Some people including the creator of the Temple Massager who suffers from migraine headaches likes the lights out while lying down and in a quiet area.
Calming
Here is how to use the Temple Massager to calm and relax.
Make yourself comfortable preferably laid down or sitting in a reclining chair. If you don’t have that just sit or lay down anywhere and open the massager arms so they are about head width apart then push the Temple Massager arms over your forehead and then adjust the pressure to your desire and begin to move the Temple Massager around your temple area. Move the massage tips all around the ear and jaw. All the while you breathe deeply.
Be Mindful, stop thinking, let the stimulation of massage and aromatherapy be your total awareness.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p> My father, Robert Smith Jr. aka Abu, has been a hard worker all his life and has always worked for himself. He  worked practically every job from being a cab driver in NYC to owning a candy shop business to owning a very small incense and body oil business, which he loved very much and was very proud of. Although, neither of these businesses made him millions it was enough for him to provide for himself and his family and keep my brother and I in private schools for a good education.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p> He was very a independent worker and always on the go even at 67 years old!, until a few months ago when he was diagnosed with complete kidney failure. He now has to go for dialysis 3 times a week which weakens him. On top of this he has type 1 diabetes, very high blood pressure, and has recently become unable to see in one eye.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Its hurtful and shocking to see him like this but I know that there is light at the end of the tunnel. One good thing I notice is that it seems that when he consistently has loving family members around him, he finds the hope, strength and will to get better. One person who I know will have the strongest impact, is his mother, my grandmother Francis. He is her first son and loves him dearly.  The only problem is that my father is in a rehab nursing home in Wilkes-Barre, PA and she lives over 600 miles away in Clover, South Carolina and she does not have the funds to go see him.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<p><i>The Obesity Epidemic Around the Globe</i></p>
<p><b>According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 69% of Americans are overweight or obese. </b>Worldwide, 35% of adults are overweight or obese. Obesity in the US has nearly doubled since 1980. From 1960 to the early 2000s, the average weight of adults in the US increased by 20 pounds: an increase from 174 to 195 pounds for men, and 145 to 165 pounds for women.</p>
<p><i>Malnourishment and Hunger Around the Globe</i></p>
<p><b>Nearly 870 million people, or one in eight of the world’s population, suffer from chronic malnourishment (United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization, FAO).</b> Of those suffering from chronic malnutrition, roughly 25,000 die per day (FAO). Under-nutrition contributes to 2.6 million deaths of children under five each year; that is, a child dies every six seconds due to hunger and malnutrition. Proper nourishment has profoundly positive effects on all aspects of a child’s growing years.</p>
<br/><h2 style=""color: #0095AA;"">How can sharing can make you feel good about weight loss?</h2>
<p><b>Losing weight isn’t easy. Two recent studies suggest that giving to others makes us happy, even happier than spending on ourselves. </b>What’s more, our kindness might create a virtuous cycle that promotes lasting happiness and altruism (Journal of Social Psychology, 2011). Weight loss alone can lead to feelings of deprivation, loneliness, and depression. The social-giving component will have a built-in feel-good factor. So, even if you take a diet tumble, instead of kicking yourself, you know you’ve done a great thing. </p>

<br/><h2 style=""color: #0095AA;"">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p><b>Why does it cost so much to build this app?</b></p>
<p>The creation of a large project such as the Share Your
Calories Application involves many hours of complex design, programming, and
product testing on the selected delivery platforms. Seamless integration with
additional programs, databases and websites, as well as monetary donation
organizations require a multitude of security features and scrutiny by many
companies and organizations to make sure that all aspects are working within
current standards and laws. Building the SYC app takes time, individuals with
nutrition expertise, and partnering with the best companies out there. Additional funding will mainly go towards the creation of an Android Application, adding a game layer to the app and creating video animations that help the message get across. The typical charge per second of finished animation is $250 to $300 USD per second.</p>
<p><b>Do weight loss apps really work?</b></p>
<p>Yes! A study from Northwestern University shows that using
mobile apps as part of your weight-loss program can help you drop as much as 15
pounds and keep it off for at least a year. That’s great news!</p>
<p><b>When will the app be ready?</b></p>
<p>We will launch the app with <i>The Calories In Calories Out Cookbook</i> in May 2014. We’ve been

HOW THE APP WORKS


Determine Your Daily Calorie Needs by entering your bio-data: height, weight, age, gender, and activity level. Start tracking your calorie input for the day by entering foods or scanning barcode labels. Track your exercise, too. The design will be intuitive and fun to keep users coming back.

Set Up Your Calorie Bank. Any calories that you don’t consume can be stored in your Calorie Bank. For instance, if you skip a 250-calorie candy bar, you can place 250 calories in your personal calorie bank. The calories are then converted to monies at the exchange rate of 250 calories = 25 cents.

Transfer Your Extra Calories to Your Calorie Bank. When you have reached $12, or more, worth of calorie savings, you have the option to donate to Stop Hunger Now. $12 will get you 48 freeze-dried meals. You will be informed when your meals are packaged and shipped, and you will receive a receipt for tax deductions. Donations of any amount can be made at any time, even without cutting back on calories!


Join the Container Club. When you donate the equivalent of a box of meals (216 meals or $54), you will be listed on the virtual container (on the Share Your Calories website) being filled for shipment. Schools, social groups, and friends can gather to make large donations, especially when natural disasters strike.

1 Stop Hunger Now high-protein dehydrated meal = 250 calories
1 meal = $0.25
1 bag = 6 meals = $1.50
1 box = 36 bags = 216 meals = $54
1 pallet = 66 boxes = 14,256 meals = $3,564
1 container = 20 pallets = 285,120 meals = $71,280



Repeat, Repeat, Repeat! And invite your friends to get involved. Together we can and will make this world a healthier and happier place.
Where do these Stop Hunger Now meals go?
Stop Hunger Now, established in 1998, has packaged over 121 million meals that have been distributed to more than 65 countries, and the list is constantly growing! They also play a key role in providing meals for global disaster relief. The Share Your Calories App will have a system to send out mass appeals for meal-funding during disasters, such as the recent tragedy in the Philippines from Typhoon Haiyan.
How does this app work with Stop Hunger Now?
The financial contributions from the Share Your Calories app would go towards funding Stop Hunger Now’s meal packaging events. The meal assembly process combines rice, dehydrated soy and vegetables, and a vitamin-mineral pack into every meal. Meal packs store easily, have a shelf-life of two years, and transport quickly. Stop Hunger Now works with international partners that ship and distribute the meals in-country. Currently, the only way Stop Hunger Now can execute meal-packaging events is for large host-organizations, such as IBM, to provide financial support. Funds from this app will enable Stop Hunger Now to engage smaller groups, such as universities, schools, civic and religious organizations, and small business to participate.

It sounds and seems benign at first, but over time it deteriorates your teeth and causes abscesses that, when not fixed, have been known to kill people. </span></h3>
<p>I have not been in a financial situation to take care of my growing cavities for roughly 4 years. This resulted in 4 of my teeth, over the past 18 months, breaking and abscessing. I was embarassed when they started to break but they were out of sight in the back of my mouth and not causing too much pain....at first. When 2 out of the 4 broke they were very sharp but I dealt with them cutting the inside of my mouth because I was trying to be strong for and not scare my children, friends, or family and knew I didn't have dental insurance nor the finances to cover it while caring for three children and from Oct 2011- Feb 2014 not having a car (which made working near impossible). </p><p>One day, at the begining of 2014, I began to get a deep pain that went from my cheek, into my jaw, and even into my neck. I tried to ignore it, but over the months it grew to be so intense I couldn't sleep and would stay up crying at night. In the end I was taking roughly 4 IB Prophen/Advil (switching off) every 2 hours and was still in unbearable pain. I went to the E. R.  multiple times and they have various ideas of what it could be but nothing solved the problem....so I found somewhere where I could get evaluated by a dentist for free. The day I went in, around June, there was a hard lump under my jaw and by my cheek...they found my tooth was terribly abscessed. I used money I didn't have to spend to have it removed. DONE! I was free of the evil infected too and was going to be all better now!....or so I thought. </p><p>Days passed and the pain didn't get better and the swelling under my jaw got worse and worse though my cheek swelling went down. When I revisited the dentist he was concerned the infection was so strong that there was a bubble, if you will, of infection that only the hospital could attend to so they said to head to the E.R.

I have been serving the community for years in many different ways: In home child care, Pet care, Plant care, House keeper, Birth Doula, Placenta specialist, Healing stone jewlery designer, Henna artist, Lactation support person, and an organic gardener who always shares the bounty with our community <3

I am a giver by nature and through my whole being, I have always had a hard time remembering to take care of myself let alone to ask for help for myself...but something has been brewing for years that is now threatening not only my happinessand ability to give my children my full attention by causing indescribable and debilitating pain at times but also something that can threaten my very life. Bad teeth by heritage. 
In my family we have beautifully straight, and often white, teeth with wonderful gums, but we make up for those gifts by a curse of being cavity ridden. It sounds and seems benign at first, but over time it deteriorates your teeth and causes abscesses that, when not fixed, have been known to kill people. 
I have not been in a financial situation to take care of my growing cavities for roughly 4 years. This resulted in 4 of my teeth, over the past 18 months, breaking and abscessing. I was embarassed when they started to break but they were out of sight in the back of my mouth and not causing too much pain....at first. When 2 out of the 4 broke they were very sharp but I dealt with them cutting the inside of my mouth because I was trying to be strong for and not scare my children, friends, or family and knew I didn't have dental insurance nor the finances to cover it while caring for three children and from Oct 2011- Feb 2014 not having a car (which made working near impossible). One day, at the begining of 2014, I began to get a deep pain that went from my cheek, into my jaw, and even into my neck. I tried to ignore it, but over the months it grew to be so intense I couldn't sleep and would stay up crying at night. In the end I was taking roughly 4 IB Prophen/Advil (switching off) every 2 hours and was still in unbearable pain. I went to the E. R.  multiple times and they have various ideas of what it could be but nothing solved the problem....so I found somewhere where I could get evaluated by a dentist for free. The day I went in, around June, there was a hard lump under my jaw and by my cheek...they found my tooth was terribly abscessed. I used money I didn't have to spend to have it removed. DONE! I was free of the evil infected too and was going to be all better now!....or so I thought. Days passed and the pain didn't get better and the swelling under my jaw got worse and worse though my cheek swelling went down. When I revisited the dentist he was concerned the infection was so strong that there was a bubble, if you will, of infection that only the hospital could attend to so they said to head to the E.R. ASAP. When I went to the E.R. they thought the swelling/""bubble of infection"" needed to be drained. So for hours on end on a Saturday night (missing my children and basically alone) I sat at the hospital being numbed up with lidocain on a swab of cloth in my mouth for roughly half an hour, then given another shot in my mouth to numb, then cut open in my mouth near my recent extraxtion site (already tender and in pain), was injected with a dye for x rays, had blood drawn, and an IV of more antibiotics all the while the room seemed to be spinning with facial pain, nausea, and a migraine.

<li>

</li>
<li>

<h3>IDEA of ""Kheelz""?</h3>
<p>When I first came up with the idea of Kheelz, it was to be a spare key shoe insert holder for my 2 children who kept losing or forgetting their house keys. I would have to leave work early in order to let them into the house. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Below is an image of my first drawings of the idea.</p>

<b></b><p></p>
<div><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>key + heel = Kheelz </b></p></div>
<p>After my children were both in an auto accident, it transformed into the potential life saving device it is today!</p>
<p>I have made way too many proof of concept prototypes before final design was approved. Below is an image of a few...</p>

</div> <p><br/></p></div>","Short Summary 
Hi-my name is Joseph Affrunti. 
I am the inventor/creator of Kheelz: Key Emergency Contact & Medical Information for Children-Every Step They Take
Kheelz provides a safe, secure and reliable way for children and to carry an In Case of Emergency Card, (ICE Card"" with them where ever they go... every step they take!



Kheelz will help your child, or a family member, in the following situations:


To quickly reunite a lost person (child, autism, dementia) with their family


To provide medical records – such as blood type, allergies, conditions, this will minimize the chance of injurious treatment and medical errors.


To notify family – minimizes the family's worry and ensures First Responders have a contact.


To provide support – ensures you have an advocate at your side ASAP – this is critical during that first ""Golden Hour"" following an accident or sudden illness


To ensure your medical wishes are followed – either provided by family or directly linked with the ID – in the same way your medical information can be provided


Kheelz is a product that utilizes my patent pending idea: a pocket cushion shoe insert 'with possible life saving benefits for children and adults being used this way.
It is a very reliable, low tech way to provide peace of mind for parents and the children who wear them.
At the retail level, the price will be around $12-15 per pair-free shipping,I will be contacting schools and daycare centers and offering a deep discount if they buy in bulk, around $7-7.50 a pair. Want to get product out there!
I am looking for your support to:

Create and launch an e-commerce website IceCardInsoles.com to promote and sell Kheelz product line
Add to my existing inventory of Kheelz for children
Contact elementary schools/child care centers to see if they would use Kheelz 

Finalize design and place first order for Kheelz for Adults


**Keep in mind when reviewing this campaign, that yes there are numerous companies selling medical alert jewelry, but because of my patent pending pocket cushion shoe insert, NO other company will be selling anything like Kheelz!  




IDEA of ""Kheelz""?
When I first came up with the idea of Kheelz, it was to be a spare key shoe insert holder for my 2 children who kept losing or forgetting their house keys. I would have to leave work early in order to let them into the house. 

Below is an image of my first drawings of the idea.


key + heel = Kheelz 
After my children were both in an auto accident, it transformed into the potential life saving device it is today!
I have made way too many proof of concept prototypes before final design was approved. Below is an image of a few...

Kheelz the PRODUCT

Each Kheelz ICE Card Shoe Insert ID System includes:


One pair of patent
pending pocket cushion shoe insertsThe insert themselves provide cushion and support often lacking in todays children shoes. The insert can be hand washed as well if needed.



Two shoelace charms with
the standard red medical emergency ID logo surrounded by the words in black ink
""ICE CARD in Shoe Insert""




Two blank Emergency
Contact/Medical ID Cards to be filled out the same way (one for each insert). These cards are special because they can be filled out with a regular ball point pen and are printed on WATERPROOF paper! 
These cards can get wet, be submerged under running water and the ink will not smear. Just dry off with paper towel and insert back into insert.

Front of tri-fold Card

How Kheelz changes EVERYTHING

Emergency ID is like an insurance policy that, when you have a claim ""pays out"", or delivers, information when and where you need it most.

Kheelz does NOT rely on electronic card readers or computer devices that first responders must figure out how they work, no passwords to enter in order to access contact/medical information. Phones are damaged in accidents so their medical ID apps are useless.First responders and emergency personnel are trained to look for medical alert jewelry.  Shoelace charms are an accepted form of medical ID and the most recommended for young children


Kheelz simplicity it what makes it so effective in an emergency situation.I have even spoken with Bob Brotchie, the creator of the ICE Card movement and he thinks Kheelz is a great idea and wishes me well on this project!
Kheelz enhances the many of the positive features of medical ID jewelry while eliminating most of the negative aspects of medical ID jewelry, such as:




Readily Available Information- ICE cards in Kheelz can provide full detailed medical records, such as blood type, allergies, conditions, medications, along with multiple family contacts, and ensure medical/religious wishes are followed. (Medical Jewelry has limited space to engrave such information.)
Updating- If your medical conditions changes or you need to update emergency contact numbers, it’s easy to do with inexpensive replacement blank Kheelz ID cards. (Medical ID jewelry is engraved and unchangeable.)
Security- Kheelz Medical ID cards are hidden within the shoe. Medical information should only be accessed when needed. No information is reveled on the ID Charms located on shoes. (Important information visible on a bracelet can cause embarrassing situation or fall into the wrong hands if Medical ID jewelry falls off.)
Breakage- Kheelz and ID’s are secure within the cushion pocket shoe insert and placed in shoe. (Jewelry based ID’s especially bracelets and necklaces are prone to breakage.)
Forgettable- With the Kheelz ICE Cards placed in shoes, when you go out, you will have medical ID every step you take! (Jewelry based ID tends to be removed for sleeping, showering, dirty chores, must be removed for many activities like gym, food handling occupations, construction work, safety sensitive jobs(don’t want the jewelry to get caught on machinery). Once jewelry is removed, it can be misplaced, lost and even easy to forget to put back on. If it’s not being worn all the time you are out, it doesn't work.)
Usability- The Kheelz: ICE Card Shoe Insert is designed for everyday use and with you every step you take. (Some ID are designed for use during a single activity- rugged sports IDs, kids throwaway wrist IDs for use on outings. These items have their place and tend to be inexpensive. Since they are not for use all the time they don’t really work to protect you. It’s like having auto insurance only on Saturday.)

Price- The Kheelz: In Case of Emergency ID System can fit any budget and  has no hidden costs compared to other jewelry based IDs:ID Cost-by this we mean the costs of the physical ID. It varies but in general entry level durable ID starts in $20 to $40 range. That’s for 1 stainless steel ID. One can spend hundreds or thousands for Swarovski crystals and gold braceletsEngraving- some companies charge for engraving the jewelry ID- can be more than $20 for 5 lines.

Kheelz will hopefully become the new standard for children's medical alert ID's.

The Impact

Just
for reference and to put things in perspective let's consider a few accident
and illness facts. This is not scare-mongering – all these stats are foot-noted
to government web sites. Accidents happen. Illness happens. Injuries happen.



Vehicle accidents - 10.8 million accidents resulted in 2.3
million children/adults treated in emergency departments2 and 35,900 deaths3 (USA 2009). (http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tab... )


Lost children - 579,000 children in the US go missing each
year4. 66,000 children in Canada go missing5.
(http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5951...)


Wandering children - 49% of autistic children wander
off at least once after age 4.
http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/missingchildren/


1,315,600 children were missing from their caregivers during 1991
(OJJDP, 2002). That is over 3600 missing
children every day, one every 24 seconds. Of these, 797,500 were reported
missing to the police or other agencies, and 198,000 were lost or injured.

After the tragedy of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting,
the parents of the deceased children were brought into the school one set of
parents at a time to help identify the children because the children couldn’t
be recognized.


You cannot control when an accident, sudden illness and injury happens. But you can control what happens afterwards – here's why you should care about controlling what happens afterwards:



32: % of Emergency Dept.
Visits with an identified information gap (Steillet al, Information Gaps in the
ER, CMAJ, 2003) 


250,000:
People killed by medical errors each year in the United States. Add the
millions who are injured and ""you have probably the third leading cause of
death"", says Dr Peter Pronovost - Sr. Vice President for Patient Safety
and Quality, Johns Hopkins Medicine. (http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/09/health/medical-mistakes/index.html)


6: hours on average for
family members to be contacted in an emergency.
http://ice4safety.blogspot.com/2010_09_01_archive.html ;
http://ice365.net/ 


To
recap, more than a third of people will directly or indirectly interact with an
emergency department; a third of emergency department visits involve a lack of
information; the third leading cause of death is medical errors. 
Who
can make sure the hospital has the right information? FAMILY. But it takes 6 hours for family members to be contacted in
an emergency!
So
the context is that bad things happen, people end up in hospitals, where
despite the best efforts and intentions of our medical system, bad things also
happen.

Do
you want to ensure the right information is provided to the hospital and that
you/your family are notified immediately that there is an emergency? Of course.
Kheelz will help family's in emergency situations and give them peace of mind more efficiently than existing products 

Risks & Challenges Like crossing the street, there are risks and challenges everyday that may affect my outlined timeline for meeting my own self imposed deadlines.
There may be delivery/supply issues with my vendors/suppliers.

<p>Hi my name is Matthew, I'm a 19 year old aspiring professional cyclist. I have been cycling for only 3 years now and I have already achieved so much. My greatest achievement to date is recording a PB for a 10 mile time trial, of 20:32, in respect of not just a friend, but a role model for my cycling. I achieved this time on just a standard road bike with 50mm wheels. Another one of my achievements is producing a 2nd place in general classification in the Downton 2 day race, where I also achieved 2nd place in the time trial stage, producing a 32:03 for a 14 mile TT on a borrowed time trial bike, as shown in my campaign photo. I have also had some good road race results with a win at both the Purbeck road race, which I broke away from the bunch with 35 miles left and stayed away by myself. I also won the Hestridge road race where myself and another great rider broke away after 5 miles and stayed away for the next 45 miles.</p>
<p>Next year I will be looking to enter the British national U23 time trial championship, of which is my main goal. As well as the national 10 and 25 and not to mention making a name for myself within the cycling community. For my future goals I am looking to go all of the way and turning into a professional cyclist. Competing with the best riders in the world and challenging for the time trial rainbow bands.</p>
<p>To help me turn my goals into a reality I am in need of some extra cash to help me purchase the equipment I require. With the kind donations, that'll be greatly appreciated, I will be looking to achieve a grand total of £6000 which will be put to purchasing time trial equipment, as listed below. If there's money left over after purchasing the equipment needed, I will put it into race entries as well as transport for the races I'll be entering.  This will help me to get noticed by bigger teams that will help me to progress to achieve my goals.</p>
<p>The money that is raised will be going to purchasing:</p>
<p>Giant Trinity pro TT frameset £2500</p>
<p>Ultegra 6870 di2 11 speed group set £900</p>
<p>Shimano di2 11 speed TT switches £180</p>
<p>Fast forward carbon rear tubular disc wheel £780</p>
<p>ISM PR 1.0 saddle £75</p>
<p>Victoria open corsa evo CX (£48x6=£288)</p>
<p>Carbon brake pads (£30x2=£60)</p>
<p>Osymetric road outer chainring £115</p>
<p>Professional bike fit £180</p>
<p>Aero helmet (depending on bike fit position) £150-£300</p>
<p>Like I said previously, if there is money left over I will be looking to use it for race entries as well as travel expenses and also maintaining the bike (services/repairs if need be).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you very much for having a look at my campaign.</p>

<p><b>Step 1</b>: Project Managers are partnering with local businesses, universities, and churches to provide
promotional workshops to introduce A Better Man, Inc. to the community. Each
workshop will provide an opportunity for each participant to register for “A
Better Man’s Challenge.” All programming will be offered at
no -cost and will be available to all men ages 21 and up. We estimate that this phase will cost approximately  $2.000 to complete, which
covers the manpower and cost associated with hosting each workshop. These costs
include but are not limited to professional fees, marketing fees, insurance,
printable materials, event space fee, speaker fees, etc.  </p>
<p><b>Step 2</b>: Each participating member of “A Better Man’s Challenge” will be
provided with the essential tools necessary to help them navigate this program. These tools
include: a life coach, print and media materials to provide assistance along
this Challenge, and exclusive membership benefits that include additional
workshops, membership meetings, webinars and so forth. Each aspect of “A Better
Man’s Challenge” will be interactive, complete with multimedia access to best
reach our network of men. E-learning content will constantly be updated to ensure that participants have the most up to date material to work with. This phase is estimated to cost $4,000 to complete which will cover the creation and implementation
of the resources provided, printing fees, and network development.</p>
<p><b>Phase 3</b>: Our  services provide opportunities for development for the life coaches and the participants. A Better Man,
Inc. provides ongoing training for our certified life coaches
throughout the duration of their program. Additionally, “A Better Man’s
Challenge” offers each participant  a
bi-weekly, hour long, life coaching session with his assigned life coach. The
1-on-1 relationships offered through the life coaching aspect of “A Better Man’s
Challenge” affords each participant the opportunity to have personalized support,
ask questions, and the space to stratgize. Participants who complete the program will be able to receive training to become life coaches themselves. This phase is estimated to cost $4,000
to implement. This will cover certification fees, continued education costs,
life coaching fees, screening fees, and operations costs.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>Direct Path to Success -<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"">Every dollar counts</span>

We all want to get better and this is our attempt to help get us there together...A Better Man, Inc was founded on the basic premise that people get better by learning how to help and how to be helped by others. We are a non profit organization that works not only to provide men with the tools necessary to make their lives better, but we also develop programming that engages men to become more involved members of their community. 
     Our 2014 year end goal is to obtain $10,000 to provide over 500 men with... 
                       ...through the A Better Man Challenge 
The A Better Man Challenge is a 90 day program where certified life coaches, trained through A Better Man Inc., provide men across the United States with free online life coaching services, mental health awareness workshops, and self development webinars designed from a multicultural perspective. Upon completion of the program, men will have the opportunity to pay forward the hand they were extended and obtain certification to provide life coaching services to other men participating in the A Better Man Challenge.
  Why A Better Man needs YOUR help All of our services are provided at absolutely no cost to the participants. This means that we have an entire staff of people working tirelessly to:        
Each contribution received creates an additional opportunity for a man that you care about to benefit from these services and give back to his community. While many people have a desire to address social ills in the world today, we are providing you with a clear cut path to help make the world a better place.The GameplanWe have estimated this 2014 “A Better Man’s Challenge” will require $10,000 from our crowd funding efforts to achieve our goal.

<h3>Our Story</h3>Pack Matthews had been teaching Yoga for more than a decade when he noticed he and many of his students were losing hard won gains after returning to their desk jobs between classes. Determined to prevent a family history of debilitating arthritis from robbing him of mobility as well, Pack first moved all his office and musical equipment to the floor to keep stretching all day. Pack's first iteration of what is now the Soul Seat emerged from perching a floor-like platform on an old task chair he found discarded along Broadway Blvd in Columbia. Pack's passion for well designed tools led him through numerous subsequent designs with the help of local talent and early fans.<br/><br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/821655/files/20140829165917-Lagoon_Blue_custom2.jpg?1409356757"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>If you've heard the meme, “Sitting is The New Smoking” you may already be aware of the health risks associated with our sedentary way of working.

If the standard office chair keeps us comfortably motionless for more than 30 minutes, can it still be called ergonomic? It's easy to feel like we're in a bind.

</p><p>First of all, thank you so much for taking the time to read about my project! <b><br/></b></p><p><b>About me: </b><br/></p><p>A series of unfortunate events have lead me 
here. Some may say I am accident prone, but I think of myself as lucky. 
After being struck by a car while walking my dog, I discovered the magic
 of acupuncture. Acupuncture has given me relief both physically and 
emotionally. After experiencing that relief, I decided I had to study 
this medicine. After 10 years working as an ICU nurse I decided my life 
needed to take a turn, both professionally and personally. I wanted to 
offer my patients more relief and something that was more affordable. I 
also wanted to focus on not just treating physical symptoms, but getting
 to the root of the problem and treating the whole person. After three 
years of attending an intense graduate program at the Seattle Institute 
of Oriental Medicine I am ready to take all the skills I have learned 
through my nursing career, mentors, and my amazing teachers and make the
 journey to Nepal.</p>
<p><b>Why I chose this project:</b></p><p>I am excited beyond words to have this amazing 
opportunity to be a part of the Acupuncture Relief Project in Nepal. I 
have always known I would go to Nepal one day, and when I heard Andrew 
speak at my school about his project, I was sold. Watching the 
“Compassion Connects” documentary moved me to tears and I knew I wanted 
to be a part of this project. Nepal
 is one of the poorest countries in the world, with little to no 
healthcare. The Acupuncture Relief Project has clinics set up in rural 
Nepal where the greatest healthcare needs are and provides a 
cost-effective, sustainable service to the people. In September I will 
be heading to Bhimphedi, Nepal for two months to work in a primary care 
clinic where the underserved people of that region will trek for hours 
to hopefully gain some relief from their multitude of illnesses.  Some
 of these people will have never seen a doctor before and we will be 
their only shot at relief. Our team will consist of six practitioners, 
each from different backgrounds, treating 20 patients per day, five days
 a week. There are full-time interpreters that work with us and help run
 the clinic, along with learning the medicine so they can continue to 
care for the patients when we depart, which makes this project 
sustainable. This is one of the many reasons I was drawn to this 
program. <br/></p><p><b>How you can help: </b><br/></p><p>Hopefully you have explored the website and watched the

<p></p><br/><p></p></div>","First of all, thank you so much for taking the time to read about my project! About me: A series of unfortunate events have lead me 
here. Some may say I am accident prone, but I think of myself as lucky. 
After being struck by a car while walking my dog, I discovered the magic
 of acupuncture. Acupuncture has given me relief both physically and 
emotionally. After experiencing that relief, I decided I had to study 
this medicine. After 10 years working as an ICU nurse I decided my life 
needed to take a turn, both professionally and personally. I wanted to 
offer my patients more relief and something that was more affordable. I 
also wanted to focus on not just treating physical symptoms, but getting
 to the root of the problem and treating the whole person. After three 
years of attending an intense graduate program at the Seattle Institute 
of Oriental Medicine I am ready to take all the skills I have learned 
through my nursing career, mentors, and my amazing teachers and make the
 journey to Nepal.
Why I chose this project:I am excited beyond words to have this amazing 
opportunity to be a part of the Acupuncture Relief Project in Nepal. I 
have always known I would go to Nepal one day, and when I heard Andrew 
speak at my school about his project, I was sold. Watching the

<p>Oral surgery went well in Brooklyn, NY.  Due to the experience that Dr. Bruce Lish has with AVMs, he was able to manage my bleeding and the healing inside my mouth has gone very well.  Next procedure dates have been moved back a week and will be performed on Nov. 22nd &amp; 25th just prior to Thanksgiving.  SO MUCH TO BE THANKFUL FOR!!!  Keep smilin'</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>UPDATE: September 9, 2013.</p>
<p>Another infection has flared up, but this time it's located inside my mouth.  My dentist, Wayne LaRiviere, referred me to an oral surgeon in Portland, ME in order to have a tooth extracted.  After he consulted with my AVM surgeon, Dr. Waner, he decided that it was not safe to extract the tooth in Maine.  Dr. Waner referred me to an oral surgeon that has experience with AVM issues, so I'm off to Brooklyn, NY next week.  Unfortunately, he is out-of-network according to my health insurance.</p>
<p>NEXT STEPS:</p>
<p>Last month, I met with Dr. Waner and am scheduled for more procedures on November 15th and 18th.  I was told in 2009 that there is no real permanent cure for my AVM, but that as it continues to evolve additional surgeries to keep it under control will be needed from time to time.  It has been 4 years since my last series of over a dozen procedures.  Unfortunately, again, the hospital that I need to go to in November is out of my insurance network, but I'm grateful that Dr. Waner's bill is covered by my insurance.  I feel that if all goes well with the November surgeries that I will be able to go many years without any more procedures needing to be done...but only time will tell.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>WHY DID I DECIDE TO LAUNCH ANOTHER INDIEGOGO CAMPAIGN?</p>
<p>For the past few years, I have set an annual goal to get out of debt.  I have not yet achieved that goal &amp; I do not see 2013 as a realistic time frame to complete that goal.  I have now set my sights on striving to become debt-free by the end of 2014.  I keep thinking: ""Enjoy the journey""...but it's not that easy at times!!!</p>
<p>A close friend that I met over 20 years ago suggested that I use the Indeogogo crowd funding platform to assist in paying the ongoing bills associated with my AVM surgeries.  All bills due for the many procedures that were started in 2009 have been paid except for one hospital bill.  I still owe $3,800 and continue to make small monthly payments to them as I am able.</p>
<p>The first Indiegogo campaign officially raised $1,202.  A donation in the amount of $1,000 was also given directly to our family, but was not given via the Indiegogo portal.  I am very grateful to all who have helped with donations and also with sharing this campaign with others!!!  Especially touching to me was a lady that donated 2 dollars.  It reminded me of the story in the New Testament of the ""Widow's Mite.""</p>
<p>I do not know how much further my family will go into debt after the dust settles once my next three procedures are completed in October &amp; November.  Missing work so often only adds to the challenge of paying our current bills &amp; striving to get out of debt.  Without the incredible support from family, friends, and even those who do not know me, our financial situation would be even more deplorable than it currently is.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>PAST POSTS:</p>
<p>Over the years I have had issues with infections &amp; spontaneous bleeding from my birthmark which has recently been properly diagnosed as an arterial-venous malformation (AVM). In 2008, my AVM got extremely aggressive and I began contemplating surgery once again. After months of research, we decided to undergo a continuing series of surgeries with a team headed by Dr. Milton Waner &amp; Dr. Alejandro Berenstein in Manhatten, NY. I am now 55 and started having surgeries in 2009 which have been going well. My last procedure was in June of this year and I have been hesitant to set a date for the next procedures that has been recommended due to financial difficulties.</p>
<p>In the same year as I started having surgeries again, I closed my construction business &amp; have struggled to meet our financial needs since. We still owe a few thousand dollars for past surgeries and I am not keen on going further into debt for additional future surgeries. Monies acquired via Indiegogo shall be used to pay for direct expenses for the procedures as well as indirect expenses such as travel, food, and other expenses.  </p>

<p>PERSONAL HISTORY</p>
<p><span style="""">(As it pertains to my AVM)</span><br/></p>
<p><span style="""">I was born with a birthmark on the right side of my face. When I was about 5 years old, I fell off my bike and got a fat lip that never went down. My Dad came back from Vietnam to pick me up from the orphanage in Rochester, NH and took me to a doctor who told us that nothing could be done.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style="""">My aunt &amp; uncle took us in when I was 8 years old and we moved to Sanford, ME. The only other problem I encountered with my AVM while growing up was a growth that appeared on the roof of my mouth when I was in junior high school. This was surgically removed with no complications.</span></p>
<p><span style="""">After graduating from high school, I tried to enlist in the US Air Force to become a pilot, but the doctor would not even give me a physical due to my birthmark. My brother, Mike, had enlisted in the US Marine Corps and talked with his recruiter about my situation. It took us seven months of battling for me to receive permission to enlist and finally I was off for boot camp at Parris Island, SC. After Infantry Training School at Camp Pendleton, CA, I was told that I could choose any available duty station in the world that I desired because I graduated at the top of my class. I discussed with the interviewing officer that I wanted to go to Annapolis, MD to become an officer and eventually a pilot. I was told that due to the aesthetics of my birthmark, there was a Navy regulation that would not allow me to become an officer. However, I could choose to go to San Diego for corrective surgery and if successful, I could pursue becoming a pilot.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style="""">I was diagnosed with a hemangioma and after several consultations, surgery was performed in October of 1977. It did not go well. I recall a temperature of 106.7 that finally abated after my being placed in a tub of ice water for over 24 hours. Nearly a month later, I was sent home for 30 days of convalescent leave to recuperate. When I returned to Camp Pendleton, the doctors told me that there was nothing more that they could do. I was transferred to an infantry battalion and served as a mortar-man until I won the base wrestling tournament. Next was a trip to Quantico, VA to try out for the All-Marine wrestling team. A shoulder dislocation sent me back to Camp Pendleton to my unit. After a run in the mountains, I woke up early in the morning with a staff infection in my birthmark. After a month in the hospital and another month of convalescent leave, I was sent to San Diego to await an honorable discharge under medical conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="""">Shortly after arriving back home in Maine, I experienced my first spontaneous arterial bleeding episode from my face. I went to several hospitals in Boston to see what could be done, but each of them had a vastly different approach with little past experience with my particular problem and no guarantees of success. I chose to not undergo any additional surgeries at that time. I had attained several credits while in the marines at Azusa Pacific College, so after working several different jobs, I decided to go to college full-time. Due to spontaneous bleeding episodes, I missed several classes and had to drop out of college. I got into the construction industry and eventually started my own business.</span><br/></p>

</div></span></div>","Hello, My name is Alanis, And this is my daddy in the picture with me.  I am almost 17 and my daddy has MS (mutiple sclerosis).  He has had crippling symptoms because of this for over 2 years now with more symptoms coming up every so often because he can't work and has no insurance and has been denied disability.  My daddy is the world to me and he's all I have.  I'm still in High School and still have 2 years left (this year & next).                                                                                                                                    I'm trying to raise money to pay for my dads increasing medical expenses.  My grandparents can't afford to help with these bills and I don't know what to do.  I know he hasn't told me how bad his health is but I can see it in his eyes not to mention his physical being.  I don't want to loose my daddy he's all I really have left.. If you know anyone who has MS you understand it's really hard to deal with and to get diagnosed and with his disability being held up for 10-18 months before we can get a hearing date things are really pilling up here.  

If you can help my daddy and I out with anything it will be greatly appreciated.  As I said I'm only 16 and he's all I have.  I just want to try and relieve some of the stress that's been weighing on our minds with all these bills.  I know everyone has bills and money isn't that easy to give up to someone you don't know...

<div>This project is a joint effort between Circle of Health International (COHI) and WATAN. COHI is a US-based non-profit organization that helps mamas and babies in some of the world's hardest places. We work with nurses, midwives, mamas themselves, locally based women's organizations, clinics, and hospitals to provide life-saving services in war and disaster settings, and within communities that have been displaced. We are midwives, doctors, nurses, trauma specialists, activists, public health professionals, and concerned members of humanity.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>WATAN is a Syria-based organization with the mission to support Syrian society by providing services that promote its progress and development. WATAN is working to provide numerous types of aid for the people of Syria during this time of conflict, from building hospitals to employing refugee women to housing orphans.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>According to the <span>United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (</span>UNHCR), there are over four million people displaced in Syria, most of them women and kids. COHI and WATAN are in Syria to help feed and protect the mamas and babies in harm's way, and we are asking for your help. </div>
<h2>Project description:  </h2>
<div>
<div>COHI and WATAN want to raise funds to purchase local flour, oil, and milk for malnourished mamas, babies, and kids under six years of age affected by the conflict in Syria. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We aim to raise $50,000 by the middle of August to provide thousands of mamas, kids, and babies with flour, cooking oil, and supplemental milk products. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Flour prices have doubled since the conflict began, making this an item most families can no longer afford. Cooking oil, needed for parents to provide cooked meals for families, is mostly unavailable as well. Supplemental milk for babies and for older children is being requested by health professionals and mothers and hasn't been seen in markets for months.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>COHI plans to promote breastfeeding through the provision of flour and oil, in an effort to enable the women to be healthy enough to produce milk without risk of malnutrition. When supplemental feeding is required, COHI and WATAN intend to provide the appropriate items for successful outcomes for moms and babies, as well. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>COHI has served over three million women in similar settings, recently sent a life-saving Solar Suitcase to provide light to a clinic without power, and delivered 3000 diapers inside of Syria. WATAN is on the ground daily assessing and addressing the needs of the Syrian people.</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2>The Impact: </h2>
<div>
<div>Inadequate availability of main staples such as flour, oil and milk has been identified as one of the main causes of malnutrition in protracted refugee settings, in a recent analysis conducted by the UNHCR jointly with the World Food Program. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Infant feeding practices including: exclusive breastfeeding, the timely and appropriate introduction of complementary feeding to children around six months of age, and continued breastfeeding alongside other foods for children until two years of age and beyond are an essential part of infant and young child health. Sadly, most children inside of Syria are not receiving enough food, either through breastfeeding or due to the unavailability of supplemental milk. COHI aims to address this through the simple procurement of flour and oil for cooking and milk for moms, babies, and children to promote adequate caloric intake. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Wars have a devastating impact on children's lives. The impact on women can be tremendous mentally, as well as physically. Some women may become malnourished themselves. There may be even more demands on a mother's time to get food for her family, source shelter and deal with insecurity. Her family support may be disrupted. All of these factors may undermine adequate feeding practices for moms and kids. Without protection and nutritional support for the mother who addresses all of these issues herself, the babies and kids are less likely to survive. </div>

<p>You can't beat death, but you can beat death in life. -Charles Bukowski</p>
<p>I spoke these words in a eulogy for my best friend Abe after he died in a tragic plane wreck. Brian and I desire to dedicate our lives to fighting death in the small ways that we can. The research of REDS is dedicated in honor and in memory of Abraham Pishevar II, who died in a plane crash in August 2014.</p>
<p>The first day of classes at Emory University, biology professor Rachelle Spell issued a challenge to all freshmen: create a faster way to detect Ebola. The passion for humanitarian work that Brian and I share fueled our desire to transform her challenge in to a reality. After all, we attend one of the few universities that treat Ebola in the United States and live a short walk from the CDC. We have access to the materials, the experts, and the literature of Emory's excellent medical research facilities. Since we found ourselves at the crossroads of the right time and the right place, we felt obligated to take action. </p>
<p>As wrestlers, Brian and I took Professor Spell's challenge to heart and outside the classroom. After speaking with numerous professionals in biochemistry, we designed REDS (Rapid Ebola Detection Strips), a user-friendly kit designed to test for Ebola in a portable and inexpensive method compared with current procedures. These procedures include Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) which can run assays for small cost. However, the start-up price of the machinery costs anywhere from 10,000$ to over 100,000$. Since Ebola is most concentrated in areas of the lowest socio-economic climate, these costs are significant obstacles for detection of the virus. </p>
<p>Furthermore, these machines cement the process of detection to the hospital, as they are expensive and require electricity. Many people infected with Ebola die before reaching these hospitals. Some even refuse to go since hospitals are often associated with death in Western Africa.  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the incubation period for the Ebola virus ranges from 2 to 21 days and has a case mortality rate of up to 90%. This allows the virus to permeate and cause death over a large population. Also, the WHO highlights that outbreaks of Ebola virus disease (EVD) are concentrated mainly ""in remote villages in Central and Western Africa"". <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">This kit is intended to be portable and user-friendly, allowing African families to receive EVD detection screening in the village setting. Additionally, REDS is designed to test for EVD before symptoms even occur, which would allow for the identification, separation, and treatment of the infected, thereby containing the virus.</span></p>
<p>The funds we raise go to the materials and equipment needed to run the Phase 1 trials, to create a prototype, and to optimize that prototype to the highest quality which could endure in the conditions present in Western Africa as well taking in to consideration implications including temperature, longevity, and efficiency. We desire to  get the most effective product to the field as soon as possible. Please consider donating for a more portable, affordable, and effective detection method for Ebola. </p>

<p>Our goal is simple: Celebrate the fun of physical activity and the benefits of healthy nutrition. This is achieved not only by organizing the running races, but also by partnering with health food companies and other organizations that promote healthy living for children.

</div></div>","What we believe... We believe our community is in desperate need of healthy, happy children. We believe our children are in desperate need of healthy, happy lifestyles. And we believe that it is possible to get children excited about moving and running around, and in turn develop those healthy lifestyles. 
We think children have a natural tendency to want to be active and so we are setting out to create The Kid's Stampede Series, the best kids-only running event around, where we focus on creating a fun, happy environment where we help our kids find joy in being healthy and fit.    The Kid's Stampede Series The Kid's Stampede Series is a series of running events, exclusively for children 16 years of age and under. Each event features a 100 yard dash for toddlers, and 1 and 2 mile runs for kids between 4 and 16 years old. They will not be timed (although we will have a race clock for kids and parents to be able to see their times), and there will be no awards. Instead we want to cultivate an environment of fun, unity, and community. Exercise should always be fun, no matter how good you are at it!

<p>The concept for Wetsleeve was born out of necessity. As passionate athletes, we are always challenging ourselves and trying to find ways to improve — whether it be through method or gear. We knew that hydration is the key to maintaining endurance while training, but couldn't find anything on the market that gave us what we needed: a seamless, convenient source of hydration that was hands-free and didn't weigh us down. That's when we got to work creating our own solution.</p>
<p>On a mission to create something that has never before existed, we teamed up with one of the best design firms in the world. Working with Development Never Stops LLC (DNS), a top athleticwear design firm based in Zurich with 16 international industry design awards, we’ve spent the last two years living and breathing hands-free hydration to find the perfect balance of capacity, utility and comfort. In doing so, we went through countless design iterations, meticulously chose every piece of fabric, rigorously tested each prototype with many athletes across a multitude of sports/activities under the most extreme conditions.</p>

</div></div>","The future of wearable hydration is here. Wetsleeve is a patented lightweight, breathable soft sleeve worn on the forearm with a refillable hydration reservoir.Wetsleeve allows you to focus and push forward without breaking your athletic rhythm. Designed for anybody with an active lifestyle, Wetsleeve is hydration in motion.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Internal 3D mesh lining allows the skin to breathe. Comes in three sizes: Small, Medium, and Large.
Zippered pocket securely holds the reservoir, and provides easy access for refills.

Adjustable wraparound band gives you the perfect fit at all times.

Also features two pockets to keep personal belongings safe on-the-go.

Made of premium, water resistant materials. Built-in insulation layer reflects heat away from the body, while keeping contents cool. For an extra cold drink, add ice to the reservoir or place it in the fridge before use.
 Wetsleeve’s detachable hydration reservoir is durable, leak proof and made of FDA-approved food grade materials. With a volume capacity of 12 oz (350ml), it can be easily filled with water or your favorite sports drink. The replaceable silicone mouthpiece situated towards the wrist allows you to effortlessly drink from a natural position. The zip seal flap and roll-top opening allows for quick and easy refills and ensures no leakage. 
 A built-in spine ensures the reservoir maintains its shape and keeps the liquid distributed across the forearm at all times- even during the most rigorous activities. After each sip, the reservoir continuously compresses to prevent the liquid from sloshing around during use.  Wherever you go, Wetsleeve goes with you.Even if you already have a hydration solution or just go running with a water bottle, we can't wait for you to try Wetsleeve and see how it changes your routine. It's lightweight, fits perfectly on your arm and it's the most convenient way to hydrate on-the-go.   Fit the sleeve onto your forearm and secure it into place with the adjustable wraparound velcro strap. That’s it! Now, you’re free to move without having to wear a bulky backpack, hold a bottle or stop your activity to hydrate.

</div></div>","Wynd's campaign has moved to Indiegogo Marketplace! Click here to get Wynd.  Wynd creates a bubble of clean air around you by removing dust, allergens, smoke, and pollution from your personal space. Since it filters harmful particles out of the air around you, Wynd helps you breathe clean air and feel refreshed.Wynd isn’t just an air purifier—it’s an intelligent personal air quality system. It monitors your environment and cleans as needed. Wynd is the size of a water bottle, so it’s easy to use anywhere—in offices, hotels, cars, public transportation, and more. Wynd helps you breathe easy wherever you go.   Freshen up your car: Wynd can clean over 70% of particles in a typical car cabin in under 10 minutes. Wynd fits in standard cupholders. 
Keep your baby safe on the go with the Wynd Stroller Holder. In a semi-enclosed stroller, Wynd can reduce PM2.5 (fine particles) by over 50% and PM10 (coarse particles) by over 70%.
  

""You can't see what's in the air that you breathe. But the sensor attached to the Wynd air purifier can figure that out for you, and actually do something to clean up that air before it hits your lungs."" - Tom's Guide""Instead of being tied to one particular room or area, Wynd can adapt to different environment. This allows a range of possibilities for use."" - PSFK""Most startups just want to reinforce your phone case or maybe make your speakers a bit more portable. And then there are the ones that have the weight of the world on their shoulders"" - TechCrunch
  Wynd weighs less than a pound, so it goes where you go.Wynd’s size makes it easy to travel with, and it’s a must-have for those going to polluted areas.No need to keep Wynd plugged in: It lasts for 8 hours of typical use without having to charge it.  Wynd keeps your personal space free from particulates, including allergens, germs, and industrial pollution (PM2.5).Wynd cleans these particles out quickly. Despite its small form factor, Wynd can deliver over 8 liters of clean air per second.You don't need to wait to breathe fresh air. Wynd can instantly funnel clean air towards you.   Wynd is more than one device: It's an air quality tracker and purifier in one— and the tracker can actually detach for ultimate mobility.Know your air quality at all times. The Wynd Air Quality Tracker continuously monitors your environment and alerts you when it becomes unhealthy. The tracker senses for the level of particulate pollution, from sources such as allergens, tobacco smoke, bacteria, mold spores, and smog. The tracker detaches from the purifier and can clip onto things. It's the smallest particulate sensor on the market, so you can easily take it with you. Check the air quality at a glance: The tracker's light color shows you how healthy the air is.  Auto modeWe don't just tell you the air quality: We proactively take care of the problem. With Auto mode, Wynd can automatically adjust its purification level to maintain a clean environment.
Just sit back, relax, and know that Wynd is keeping your air healthy. 
Learn more about what you're breathingOpen the Wynd app (for iOS and Android) to get more insights into your environment.Get notified when the air quality around you is getting worse.Track how your environment changes over time.Wynd tells you how much pollution it's kept out of your lungs. By tracking air quality, airflow level, and usage duration, we can determine how many milligrams of particulate matter Wynd has cleaned from the air.Got friends in L.A., a grandma in Beijing, or a child you want to keep safe? Keep tabs on your loved ones' air quality. Check out macro air quality levels with Air Bubbles, our free companion iOS app. As our community grows, we can even combine everyone’s tracker data to create a worldwide crowdsourced air quality map—the Waze of air quality. This would open the doors to hyper-local air quality info that could help people around the globe stay healthy.    
 We worked with Mike Nuttall, one of the co-founders of IDEO, to bring Wynd to life. He designed numerous beautiful and successful consumer electronic products, so we knew he’d help us create a product that’s beautiful and easy to use.Watch Mike discuss his philosophy behind the design of Wynd: 
 
Wynd was designed to fit in anywhere.Wynd includes a dynamic 360-degree LED light ring that indicates air quality, airflow, battery level, and filter use.We don’t believe in just having low, medium, and high settings: Wynd enables you to gradually adjust its purification level from 0 to 100—to find the setting that’s most comfortable for you—by turning the top knob left or right.

 Wireframing the Wynd app
  Airflow designOur engineering lead, Eric, is an aerospace engineer who worked on the design of jet and rocket turbine blades before joining Wynd. He used his airflow expertise to craft Wynd’s patent-pending fluid dynamics.We designed a low-turbulence, high-airflow system that keeps Wynd small while enabling it to clean a high volume of air and stay quiet.Watch Eric discuss how he designed some of Wynd's airflow features:    Early iterations of Wynd's fluid dynamics   
 
3D-printed iterations of Wynd's airflow system components 
 
The filterWynd contains a medical-grade air filter, capable of purifying particles as small as 0.3um (1 / 210th the average thickness of human hair).The filter is lined with an antimicrobial layer lined with silver to keep it clean from microbes such as bacteria and mold. As air passes through this filter, the particulate pollutants are removed and any residual germs are killed off, and purified air flows out into your environment.  The filter typically lasts for 3 months in a polluted environment (with an average AQI of 200). In a less polluted environment, it lasts between 3 months and 1 year.But don't worry about having to calculate it—we do it for you.Replacing filters is automated: By tracking how polluted the air is around the filter—as well as Wynd’s airflow level and usage duration—we can tell you how used up the filter is and alert you when it’s time to order a replacement.You can even subscribe to automated filter shipments: We’ll send a new filter to your door whenever it’s time for a replacement, so you don’t have to think about it.Replacing the filter is way easier than on cars or house filters: With Wynd, just pop the old one out and pop the new one in.Wynd's replacement filters will be $7 each. Smallest particulate sensor on the market
We spent 18 months developing our own patent-pending, particulate matter (PM) sensor because everything on the market was too big—and too inaccurate.We created the smallest commercial PM sensor in the world.
The Wynd sensor—officially named the Wynd Air Quality Tracker—is highly accurate. It’s comparable to much more expensive (and larger) sensors. And, many of those large and expensive sensors stop working over time because grime and pollutants throw off their mechanisms. To avoid this, we engineered the tracker to remain highly accurate over time through dynamic calibration and an internal design that protects sensitive components from accumulating dust.Our prototype trackers have a very high correlation (0.99) with high-end, professional air quality sensors such as the TSI DustTrak (which sells for around $5,000 and is the size of a handheld vacuum cleaner). The chart below shows a test we conducted of the Wynd Air Quality Tracker prototype vs. the TSI DustTrak II, and yields a correlation of 0.99 (the highest is 1.00):Recharges quickly Wynd uses the new (and soon-to-be widely adopted) USB Type-C cable, which enables the device to fully recharge in 4 hours. Lab-testedAlthough we built Wynd to purify the air in your personal space, we decided to see how well it could clean a small room. So we had it tested in a 640-cubic-foot chamber (comparable to an 8x10ft room) by Research Technical Institute, a leading national research institute and filtration testing laboratory. Check out the difference Wynd made: 
We’re happy to give Wynd to your friends and family. If you would like to give Wynd as a gift, you can provide us with an alternate shipping address after purchasing an Indiegogo perk.  
   
 
 
   
  
We created Wynd out of a need to create clean environments for ourselves and our families wherever we go.Ray (the founder) frequently traveled to Asia, where poor air quality is a well-known problem. He hated the way pollution made him feel, and wanted to be able to take healthy air with him on the go. An engineering major at MIT, he decided to take action—he brought together a team that included other MIT engineers, seasoned designers, and even a former rocket scientist to build such a device.Air quality affects people all over the world and comes in different forms. Allergens, germs, and smog decrease quality of life and lead to long-term health issues. As we developed Wynd, we met people from all walks of life who wanted to breathe healthier air. Over 40 prototypes were distributed to people from the U.S. to China to Israel and Nepal. Testers used them to clear their allergies in San Francisco, keep themselves and their families (and even babies) safe from air pollution in Beijing, and filter out mold spores from hotel rooms in Southeast Asia.After 20 months of work we’re excited to bring you Wynd. We hope it will have a positive impact on your life.For more about our story please read Ray's blog post here.",55.0,2,"3 Campaigns

At just over 5 feet tall, Savannah weighs over 225 lbs and suffers as the target of her 7th grade classmates' cruelty. Savannah is an artist, girl scout and avid volunteer, who has recently started to teach art to autistic children. Loving, kind and sweet, Savannah doesn't recognize her own self-worth. Other people's opinions matter to hear, especially concerning her weight. </span></p>

Her parents struggle financially just to benefit from the top schools in a well-to-do area, which Savannah requires because of her educational special needs. Savannah's parents are suffering not only from the financial weight of living expenses, but one of their sons has heart complications and his surgeries have capped the insurance out at over $5 million—twice. He has endured 9 heart surgeries, 2 strokes and is on his third pacemaker. </span></p>

Part of Savannah's prescribed care was high doses of steroids and prednisone, which increased her weight even more. Her blood pressure and weight have continued to rise. </span></p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: medium; font-weight: normal;""><br/></span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: medium; font-weight: normal;"">The expenses caused Savannah and her family to lose their home, personal belongings and most basic living necessities. With no savings and two bankruptcies on their record, Savannah's family rebuilt their life. Savannah still comes off the school bus crying because of what other students say to her. Her parents fear her weight will continue to be out of control and become life-threatening.<br/></span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: medium; font-weight: normal;"">Both of Savannah's parents work in the medical field, but due to expenses they have a little over one hundred dollars in savings.

</div></div>","Savannah's Story
When we received a letter from Savannah Hunter's parents we knew she needed a jump start on her weight loss journey. At just over 5 feet tall, Savannah weighs over 225 lbs and suffers as the target of her 7th grade classmates' cruelty. Savannah is an artist, girl scout and avid volunteer, who has recently started to teach art to autistic children. Loving, kind and sweet, Savannah doesn't recognize her own self-worth. Other people's opinions matter to hear, especially concerning her weight. 
Her Family's Struggle
Savannah is the youngest of three older brothers. Her parents struggle financially just to benefit from the top schools in a well-to-do area, which Savannah requires because of her educational special needs. Savannah's parents are suffering not only from the financial weight of living expenses, but one of their sons has heart complications and his surgeries have capped the insurance out at over $5 million—twice. He has endured 9 heart surgeries, 2 strokes and is on his third pacemaker. 
A few years ago sub-par home repairs after terrible storms exposed her entire family to toxic mold, which increased hospital and doctor visits, and of course, medical bills. Part of Savannah's prescribed care was high doses of steroids and prednisone, which increased her weight even more. Her blood pressure and weight have continued to rise. 
The expenses caused Savannah and her family to lose their home, personal belongings and most basic living necessities. With no savings and two bankruptcies on their record, Savannah's family rebuilt their life. Savannah still comes off the school bus crying because of what other students say to her. Her parents fear her weight will continue to be out of control and become life-threatening.Both of Savannah's parents work in the medical field, but due to expenses they have a little over one hundred dollars in savings. Not only are Savannah and her brother's medical costs strapping the family budget, but her great-grandparents and her aunt are also the responsibility of her parents.
What Savannah Needs
Savannah needs a summer in the nurturing and unconditional love found at Camp Shining Stars, a non-profit teen weight loss camp in North Carolina. At Camp Shining Stars Savannah will learn:
How to make better food choices
Not to eat out of boredom

To be accountable for her actions


Camp Shining Stars “Where Winners LOSE” is a non-profit, co-educational summer weight loss camp for teens hosted on the Barton College campus of Wilson, NC. They believe every child has inherent qualities of importance, beauty, and the capacity to enrich and be enriched by the world in which they live, regardless race, sex, ethnic heritage, income or socio-economic class. Camp Shining Stars promotes the welfare and healthy development of children and grants an environment of acceptance, discipline and affection. Unique in size, privacy and independence, Camp Shining Stars is smaller than traditional summer camps, offers a private residence life with two campers to a room, and is the only weight loss camp that allows campers to choose their own activities. Focused on teaching young adults the habits necessary for leading a healthy life, raising self esteem and losing weight, Camp Shining Stars is supported by a distinguished medical advisory board and offers a menu influenced by nutrition majors at Cornell University, University of North Carolina and East Carolina University. www.campshiningstars.org

Camp Shining Stars' Story

My name is Ira Green and I am the founder and director for Camp Shining Stars.  My North Carolina-based non profit camp is a six-week summer weight loss camp for teens ages 12 to 18
. Savannah's story is just one of many young adults who are unable to afford a life-changing summer at camp.
 Not every family can afford to send their overweight kids to a camp. We hope to do that, not only for their self-esteem and immediate physical changes, but also to reduce their risks for developing chronic diseases later in life. $12,000 will send Savannah and two other underprivileged teens to camp for the summer.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are a group of college students who love to perform jazz and show tunes from the 30's, 40's, and 50's.  We are putting on a show directed, choreographed, and produced all by students... but WE HAVE NO MONEY FOR COSTUMES, PROPS, OR TO PAY THE BAND!  Please help us put on this show!

<p>We need about $700 dollars for costumes, props, and payment for our live band.  (The rest of the performers are working for free.)  Without this money, we will not be able to put on the show, and that means that hundreds of women will not get the treatment they need for breast cancer.  WE WILL TAKE ANY DONATION, NO MATTER HOW SMALL!!!<br/></p>

<h3>
<strong> What is Cerebral Palsy??</strong> </h3>
<p>Cerebral palsy is a condition, a general term which means that there was a lack of oxygen to the brain at birth or sometime during the delivery. As a result of brain injury, developmental delays occur which affect motor coordination, reflexes, speech, and muscle tone. The injury can result in mild to severe developmental issues. It is very important to give children with cerebral palsy all of the resources possible in order for them to reach their full potential and are able to function as independent as possible as adults. Simple things that most of us do with ease can be difficult for those that have cerebral palsy, such as feeding oneself, and being able to communicate wants and needs. These types of tasks are important and can be accomplished by retraining the brain through various therapies and specialized equipment.</p>

<p><strong>Our story:</strong></p>
<p>Mom and dad bought our home 10 years ago but because they did not qualify for financing on their own they put the house in dad's parents' names. Now mom and dad are divorcing (without warning, dad left us at the end of May and just never bothered to come back) and dad's parents are falsely claiming the house is THEIRS so that mom doesn't get her share of what she is entitled to for the house. Today, the house is up for sale and mom can't do a thing to stop it because her name is not anywhere on any paperwork to prove who the house really belongs to. To make matters worse, there is an accepted offer on the house and if it goes through (must be court approved first) the new owners will take full possession of our house by mid-November which will leave our mom and us with no roof over our heads. Mom only first learned of this news (the accepted offer) just YESTERDAY (Oct. 18/12) so it's not like she's had any time to prepare for herself (and us) to be ""uprooted"" from the only home we've ever really known.</p>
<p>Currently, we are left with only two feasible options:</p>
<p><strong>1 - Hit the streets!</strong> We currently have no real income to speak of because both of us (sisters) are full time honor students working extremely hard to acheive particular goals and we put all our effort into reaching them.  Kaila (oldest) is in interior design and Alicia, youngest, is focusing on criminal law as well as creative writing.  We both attend classes full time and then we dedicate our so-called ""free"" time with additional studies.  As for mom, the only income she has is spousal and child support which is minimal at best and she cannot work due to disability (she is awaiting disability benefits as we speak).  Housing here is most difficult to find at the best of times but with a household of three and no true income to even rely on, well...good luck with that ever happening because it won't (and even mom's lawyer and the judge presiding over her case agree).  </p>
<p><strong>2 - Buy our home outright;</strong> The only way this can be done is by mom providing an offer on it that is ""greater than"" the offer that is already on it (the courts will ""deny"" current accepted offer if mom can ""outbid"" it) but her offer has to be in by next week to even be considered. She ""DOES"" have a way of getting approved for a mortgage but ONLY if she can come up with a minimum down payment of $30,000 first to ""hold"" any offer she presents.  Unfortunately, the money she would like to use for the down payment is currently being held in trust by the courts and will not be released until AFTER the house has actually been sold so she won't even have access to it until then and by then, of course, it will be too late to save our home.  This is the only home we have ever really known and we will be crushed beyond words if we have to leave it and, most especially, if we have to leave it based on the fact that someone else is saying they own it when they most certainly do not (talk about rewarding the guilty!!). It would also be in mom's best interest to buy the home outright because the monthly mortgage payments she would be paying would be FAR LESS than what she would be paying to ""throw money away"" on a rental here in Victoria so, naturally, that would be the very best option, both financially and for future security. </p>
<p>This is where we are hoping all of YOU wonderful folks will come in and help us out; we need YOU to help us reach that $30,000 down payment as there is no way we can do it on our own (remember, we only got word of all of this YESTERDAY so it's not like we have time on our side to get such funds together so quickly). This is why our urgency; if mom is to stand ANY chance of saving our home she has to put an offer on it by next week at the latest otherwise our home will go to those who put the original accepted offer on it leaving us and our mother no home at all. Oh, and yes, we are aware that Indiegogo holds contributions for a two week period after a campaign ends but, even so, this is okay, just as long as we can still give the courts ""ASSURANCE"" by next week that we'll sincerly be able to come up with these funds needed for the down payment at the time mom actually puts in her offer (we don't physically have to have the funds by next week, we just have to have the assurance we will be getting them). </p>
<p>Anyway, we hope we have shared enough to give you all the ""gyst"" of what we are trying to say. However, if you have any questions, please feel free to let us know at anytime and we will answer them in the very best way we can.  If you would like to contact mom personally/confidentially, you can reach her at her personal email address:  <a href=""mailto:ametalqueen@yahoo.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ametalqueen@yahoo.ca</a> (this is also her Paypal account address if you would like to contribute that way instead).  For those who cannot contribute (and we know some of you surely cannot) we would sincerely appreciate it if you could spread word of our campaign anywhere and everywhere you can possibly think of (you can use the Indiegogo share tools for doing this as they are easy to use and will be of great service to you) so that our campaign gets noticed far and wide.  Any and all help would be more than welcomed.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your time.</p>
<p>Alicia and Kaila (and mom, too!)  </p>
<p>PS:  If we do not reach our goal and we do lose our home, we will likely use any funds we do receive (dependent on amount, if any) to purchase a car so that we at least have wheels to get from A to B during the winter weather (dad took our only vehicle with him when he left). The reason we are requesting $33,000 instead of an even $30,000 is because we need to be sure we are left with $30,000 once Indiegogo takes their cut ($33,000 - Indiegogo fees = $30, 690). Also, mom says if anyone wants to talk to her lawyer to validate anything we are saying you are more than welcome to do so...just give us the word and we will give you the details for doing so.  We ARE real people in legimate need, we promise!</p></div>","Can anyone help us, PLEASE, our mom and us are facing homelessness soon and we are scared to death.

<h3>""Your hand opens and closes and opens and closes. <br/>If it were always a fist or always stretched open, you would be paralyzed. <br/>Your deepest presence is in every small contracting and expanding, the two as beautifully balanced and coordinated as bird wings.""<br/>-<br/>Rumi</h3>

<p><strong>Iolani Azul was born <strong>on February 18, 2009 <strong>in Oakland, California</strong> </strong>with congenital hydrocephalus and had suffered a stroke in utero . We were told that because of the extreme brain damage it caused she would most likely be a vegetable if she survived birth. Mark, her dad, and I, JoAnna, were so scared but we decided to take the challenge because we had already fallen in love with Iolani while she was growing inside of me. When she came out, weighing 11 lbs and 23 inches and screaming at the top of her lungs, we knew we had done the right thing by keeping her. But our battle had just begun... <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Iolani had brain surgery at 8 days old to place a shunt in her brain. Leading up to this surgery we were told that her neurological damage caused her to have cerebral palsy, hemiplegia and visual impairments, which meant that the whole right side of her body was paralyzed. Once we left the hospital after weeks and weeks, we went home exhausted. But we were ready to start the hard work of helping Iolani walk, talk, and use the limited vision she was born with to become as independent as possible. </strong></p>
<p><strong> She began seeing an Early Interventionist from Easter Seals who supported her overall development, a Physical therapist, an Occupational therapist who focused on her hemiplegic (right) side, a vision specialist from Blind Babies who supported us in trying to figure out the extent of damage and how to support Iolani maneuvering the world with her limited eyesight. On top of that we had constant visits to the Neurosurgeon, Neurologist (who not only ended up monitoring Iolani's shunt but found out at 3 months old she had epilepsy and was having daily seizures), Opthamologist, Pediatrician, High Risk Infant Clinic, and other specialists depending on the region of her body that was affected by the hydrocephalus/stroke. <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Over the years of constant doctor and therapy visits, Iolani has beaten most of the odds against her. At 5 months, Iolani spoke her first word, ""mama"" (which we were told she would NEVER do). Following that her vocabulary blossomed and she hasn't stopped talking since. After her 2nd birthday she decided to break down the huge obstacle of walking, something that the doctors had told us she would NEVER do. It took a year of practicing to be stable enough on her feet to completely independently walk but she got there. At 3 she began pre-school (once again, which the doctors said she would NEVER do) and has been happily asking us to take her to school every day since. </strong></p>
<p><strong>However, with all these triumphs, Iolani Azul, at almost 4 years old, still cannot do many of the things other children her age are able to do. Iolani cannot stand up on her own. She cannot dress herself or put on her own shoes. She cannot play on the playground by herself. She has very bad balance. Her vision is completely cut-off on both right sides of her eyes (thus running into things, not seeing when people are coming at her, and falling constantly). She has a very hard time feeding herself with utensils. And when faced with a fall or a seizure she is not able to use the right side of her body to help prevent or sustain her. <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>This is what had led us to create this campaign. We believe that Iolani's life could be exponentially better if she was able to fully use her right hand and arm. We've done our research and feel the best solution is to send her to constraint therapy camp. A smaller, less intensive, beginner camp will be happening in San Francisco from January to February but the more intensive  therapeutic camp will happen in New Jersey in July of 2013. Our hope if we reach our fundraising goal is to send her to both camps as the damage is so extensive and the benefits would be so great.  <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>However, there are many components to sending Iolani to camp, specifically Camp Helping Hands in New Jersey. I, mama, will have to take 2 months off work to attend the camp with her thus losing my income for that amount of time as well as the travel and lodging expenses.  <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Each camp costs $5000 = $10000 (without lodging in New Jersey)<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Subletting a NJ apartment/studio = $1500 (hopefully not more than this)<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Traveling cross-country by car (as Iolani is unable to fly for now because of the extreme pressure in her head and her lack of expressive language) = 3000 miles each way = $3500 (gas, tolls, etc)<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Lodging cross-country = <strong>1 1/2 weeks on the road to and from = $2500</strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>Once on the East Coast we have to drive each day to and from camp to home = $250<br/></strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Food for entire 2 months = $1000<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Travel Medical Insurance + any Emergency visits Iolani might require during the 2 month trip = $1000<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Loss of JoAnna's income = $4000 (for 2 months)<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Hopefully you are able to see how costly the trip will be. However, we feel very confident after seeing other children who have attended the camps, before and after. The level of independence that comes after attending the camps is amazing. <br/></strong></p>

</div></div>","""Your hand opens and closes and opens and closes. If it were always a fist or always stretched open, you would be paralyzed. Your deepest presence is in every small contracting and expanding, the two as beautifully balanced and coordinated as bird wings.""-Rumi
 
Iolani Azul was born on February 18, 2009 in Oakland, California with congenital hydrocephalus and had suffered a stroke in utero . We were told that because of the extreme brain damage it caused she would most likely be a vegetable if she survived birth. Mark, her dad, and I, JoAnna, were so scared but we decided to take the challenge because we had already fallen in love with Iolani while she was growing inside of me. When she came out, weighing 11 lbs and 23 inches and screaming at the top of her lungs, we knew we had done the right thing by keeping her. But our battle had just begun... 
Iolani had brain surgery at 8 days old to place a shunt in her brain. Leading up to this surgery we were told that her neurological damage caused her to have cerebral palsy, hemiplegia and visual impairments, which meant that the whole right side of her body was paralyzed. Once we left the hospital after weeks and weeks, we went home exhausted. But we were ready to start the hard work of helping Iolani walk, talk, and use the limited vision she was born with to become as independent as possible. 
 She began seeing an Early Interventionist from Easter Seals who supported her overall development, a Physical therapist, an Occupational therapist who focused on her hemiplegic (right) side, a vision specialist from Blind Babies who supported us in trying to figure out the extent of damage and how to support Iolani maneuvering the world with her limited eyesight. On top of that we had constant visits to the Neurosurgeon, Neurologist (who not only ended up monitoring Iolani's shunt but found out at 3 months old she had epilepsy and was having daily seizures), Opthamologist, Pediatrician, High Risk Infant Clinic, and other specialists depending on the region of her body that was affected by the hydrocephalus/stroke. 
Over the years of constant doctor and therapy visits, Iolani has beaten most of the odds against her. At 5 months, Iolani spoke her first word, ""mama"" (which we were told she would NEVER do). Following that her vocabulary blossomed and she hasn't stopped talking since. After her 2nd birthday she decided to break down the huge obstacle of walking, something that the doctors had told us she would NEVER do. It took a year of practicing to be stable enough on her feet to completely independently walk but she got there. At 3 she began pre-school (once again, which the doctors said she would NEVER do) and has been happily asking us to take her to school every day since. 
However, with all these triumphs, Iolani Azul, at almost 4 years old, still cannot do many of the things other children her age are able to do. Iolani cannot stand up on her own. She cannot dress herself or put on her own shoes. She cannot play on the playground by herself. She has very bad balance. Her vision is completely cut-off on both right sides of her eyes (thus running into things, not seeing when people are coming at her, and falling constantly). She has a very hard time feeding herself with utensils. And when faced with a fall or a seizure she is not able to use the right side of her body to help prevent or sustain her. 
This is what had led us to create this campaign. We believe that Iolani's life could be exponentially better if she was able to fully use her right hand and arm. We've done our research and feel the best solution is to send her to constraint therapy camp. A smaller, less intensive, beginner camp will be happening in San Francisco from January to February but the more intensive  therapeutic camp will happen in New Jersey in July of 2013. Our hope if we reach our fundraising goal is to send her to both camps as the damage is so extensive and the benefits would be so great.  
However, there are many components to sending Iolani to camp, specifically Camp Helping Hands in New Jersey. I, mama, will have to take 2 months off work to attend the camp with her thus losing my income for that amount of time as well as the travel and lodging expenses.  
Each camp costs $5000 = $10000 (without lodging in New Jersey)
Subletting a NJ apartment/studio = $1500 (hopefully not more than this)
Traveling cross-country by car (as Iolani is unable to fly for now because of the extreme pressure in her head and her lack of expressive language) = 3000 miles each way = $3500 (gas, tolls, etc)
Lodging cross-country = 1 1/2 weeks on the road to and from = $2500
Once on the East Coast we have to drive each day to and from camp to home = $250
Food for entire 2 months = $1000
Travel Medical Insurance + any Emergency visits Iolani might require during the 2 month trip = $1000
Loss of JoAnna's income = $4000 (for 2 months)
 
Hopefully you are able to see how costly the trip will be. However, we feel very confident after seeing other children who have attended the camps, before and after. The level of independence that comes after attending the camps is amazing. 
We're so incredibly humbled to ask for this support to help our little girl overcome yet another challenge which we were told she would NEVER do. Use her right arm (right side of her body) to support herself. 
 
We thank you all in advance for any and all support you can contribute during this fundraiser. We are blessed to have a supportive community of family and friends and we ask that you share this campaign far and wide.
 
With all the appreciation in our hearts,
Mark, JoAnna and our little miracle, Iolani Azul

<p>On July 26<sup>th</sup> 2013 my brother committed suicide after
a 2 year battle with drug addiction and depression</p>
<p>This is his story.</p>
<p>One week before his death threatened suicide and drank some
bleach. He was put into the hospital. Unfortunately, he failed to get the help
that he deserved during his 3 day stay at the hospital. He told the nurse “I
want to stay here. I’m safe. I don’t trust myself back on the streets.” The
nurse told him that there was nothing they could do because he didn’t seem
depressed. On the second night of his stay we were told that he would be
released the next day. My mother, father, and my brother’s bestfriend all protested
his release. They told the nurse “If you release him, he’s going to end up
dead.” And that’s exactly what happened but the Vancouver Island Health Authority
failed to listen.</p>
<p>During his hospital stay he even asked the nurse how much treatment
was “20,000”, she said. My brother said “So, if I had money I could go today,
but since I’m broke you’re just going to send me back into the streets” she
answered with, “I’m sorry that’s just the way the system works.”</p>
<p>On release day my brother called a friend to pick him up.
The friend turned to the nurse and said “So what’s he supposed to do now?” The
nurse said “That’s for him to figure out!” </p>
<p>Five days later my brother was dead.</p>
<p>There is an extreme lack of care for those with mental
health issues and/or drug addiction. Two weeks before my brother died the exact
same thing happened to two other people. They weren’t given proper help and
committed suicide. It’s becoming more and more common.</p>
<p>In honour of my brother, I am forming a foundation called ""D-boy; Walk for change"" (my brother always called himself D-boy) Around this time next year there will be a walk to raise more awareness for those who struggle with mental health. My goal through this walk and other fundraising is to raise 10,000 to 15,000 dollars to send someone to treatment. My brother, unfortunately was unable to get the help he so desperately needed and deserved, but I would like to give somebody else the chance to reach sobriety and live a happy and healthy lifestyle.</p>

<br/><h1>What Is  MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy?</h1>
<p><strong>MDMA-assisted psychotherapy combines talk therapy with the use of MDMA</strong>, a drug that may enhance the effectiveness of psychotherapy for PTSD.</p>
<p><strong>MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) is a synthetic compound</strong> recognized for its ability to decrease fear and defensiveness while increasing trust and empathy. MDMA may increase the effectiveness of psychotherapy by strengthening the alliance between therapist and patient, and helping subjects feel more comfortable discussing difficult memories and emotions.</p>
<br/><p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.maps.org/images/vetsgogo/txroom2.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: none;""/><br/><em>MDMA-assisted psychotherapy study treatment room</em></p>
<br/><p><strong>MDMA-assisted psychotherapy isn't just for reducing  symptoms of PTSD</strong>—instead, it can help people uncover what's causing their symptoms and make lasting changes. Conventional pharmaceutical treatments require patients to take drugs daily for months, years, or even their entire lives. In MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, MDMA is only administered a few times, and even a single session can have a profound effect.</p>
<p><strong>With MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, subjects only take the drug two or three times</strong>—not every day for years, like current prescription treatments.</p>
<p>MDMA-assisted psychotherapy isn't like currently available prescription treatments for PTSD—<strong>study participants don't take the drug home</strong>. MDMA-assisted psychotherapy is administered in a therapist's office, and subjects are required to stay the night.</p>

<br/><h1>We Need a More Effective Treatment</h1>
<p><strong>Over  a third of PTSD patients do not respond adequately to established psychotherapies</strong>. Cognitive behavioral therapies such as prolonged exposure and cognitive  processing therapy, psychodynamic therapy, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, and other psychotherapeutic treatments for PTSD are all similarly ineffective for some patients.</p>
<p>Two selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)—<strong>paroxetine (Paxil®)  and sertraline (Zoloft®)</strong>—are currently marketed as PTSD medications in  the U.S. These drugs must be taken every day for a long time and even then are often ineffective, increasing the prevalence of side effects.</p>

Powerful Evidence, Promising Futures
In a recently completed  study, 83% of  subjects receiving MDMA-assisted psychotherapy no longer qualified for PTSD, and everyone who received a placebo and then went on to receive MDMA-assisted psychotherapy experienced significant and lasting improvements. These results were published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology. These subjects had suffered from PTSD for an average of 19 years.
A long-term follow-up of subjects receiving MDMA-assisted psychotherapy revealed that overall benefits were maintained on average for 3½ years or more.



A Swiss study published in 2013 also found clinically significant improvements in PTSD symptoms after MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.

PTSD—It's Not Just Veterans
PTSD can have many causes—including war, sexual assault, childhood abuse, torture, violent crime, accidents, natural disasters, and other severely stressful events.


PTSD affects over 7.7 million Americans

There are over 200,000 rapes and sexual assaults every year in the U.S., or about one every two minutes
Over 3,000,000 cases of child abuse are investigated every year in the U.S.
The results from this study will add to the growing evidence for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy as a safe and effective treatment for PTSD from any cause, and motivate the U.S. Department of Defense and Veterans Administration to become directly involved in this research.

Over half of the substances sold in unregulated criminal markets under the  names Ecstasy and Molly contain no MDMA at all, and often contain mephedrone, MDPV, ketamine, caffeine, BZP, or other more dangerous adulterants.
The risks of MDMA also significantly increase when combined with intense exercise, dehydration, or exhaustion; when consumed in excessive or unknown dosages; and when combined with other drugs, including alcohol.
