<h3><b>What our service will bring to the rental market</b></h3>
<p>Our web application will introduce a new modern method of tenant and landlord interaction in a better, faster, safer and paperless way. Our goal as a company is to promote an ethical and fair process for both parties (landlord and tenant). </p>
<p> We plan to level the playing field when it comes to renting by ensuring fairness on both sides of the equation with our new process. We will guarantee that both parties are treated fairly, in an ethical way. To do this, we will provide a service to streamline the application and contract process between landlords and tenants, improving upon the current utility provider services model that is offered, guaranteed representation for both parties through our new representation model, as well as some other features that will add to the rental experience. </p>

<h3><b>Who are we?</b></h3>
<p><b>Ali
AlQahtani (27)</b>, a rising entrepreneur in the rental market. In 2005, I
graduated high school in the top 1% in all of Saudi Arabia and passed my ACT in
the top 5% internationally. From there, I started my degree in Mechanical
Engineering at King Saud University in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and transferred to
NYU to complete it. The true beginning to my career started at American
Express. While there, I developed the “You Are My Customer program”: this
created the opportunity to pay rent month by month through American Express, as
opposed 6 months advance pay in the following countries: Dubai, Kuwait, Saudi
Arabia, Oman, and Bahrain. American Express presented me with the GNS
President's Award in 2010 and granted me the opportunity to continue schooling
in the United States. I will be graduating from Gannon University the 2016-2017
school year with two more degrees in Accounting, Risk Management Insurance and
minoring in Finance.</p>
<p><b>Michael Hanna (31)</b>, a rising entrepreneur with a strong technical background.
In 2002 I graduated from high school through an advanced 2-year high school
program, Computer Information Systems.  In that program the class worked
on a capstone project for a competition during our senior year, which I lead
development of the software system we created.  The concept was a virtual
classroom for the elementary level.  That project won the regional
competition and was showcased at the state level.  Along with the work I
did personally on that project, I was able to secure an IT Internship with a
local fortune 500 company.  I worked full-time as an intern while
attending college and completed a complete redesign of an internal website
servicing around 200 users, among other projects.  After completing my
Associates Degree of Science in Internet Information Systems, I was hired on
full-time and have been working there continuously for the last 13 years,
presently a Senior Software Systems Engineer.  In addition to that job I
have also done freelance work on the side, designing, developing, and launching
5 websites over the last 4 years.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Personal Successes</b></p>
<p>With one degree in Mechanical Engineering already acquired, two degrees in Accounting and Risk Management Insurance with a minor in Finance that are soon to be obtained, Ali has secured himself academically.  With 13 years in the web space and Information Technology field, Michael has proven his skills time and time again.</p>
<p>The You Are Our Customer program and GNS President's Award were not Ali's only triumphs. In 2010 and 2011, Ali created a Youth Art &amp; Entertainment program in two different malls in Saudi Arabia. One month out of every summer, Ali offered this program in two booths in two separate malls. The overall profit from each booth totaled $150,000, which allowed him to start the You Are Our Customer program while working with American Express. </p>

<h3><b>What We Want to Achieve</b></h3>
<p>We’ve
both dreamt of creating a means by which we can add significant value and
impact to the current world, and believe we have found a way to do so. By effecting
significant change in the renting market and redefining the process it operates
upon, we will create a fair trade tool for landlords and tenants. A more secure
environment by which this process can flourish. <b><i>The initial patents for
this project have been granted.</i></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b>Our Plans With This Campaign Funding</b></h3>
<p>Our
goal is to raise $40,000 USD to allow us to hit the ground running. There are
various costs to the startup including:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">4 different encryption services</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Cyber and Financial Insurance</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Legal Construction Fees</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Certified Public Account Fees</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">URL Domain Purchasing</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Current and Future Patent Costs</span></li>
</ul>
<p>All
of these investments will allow us to provide secure, comprehensive, and fair
practices to those who are interested in using our services.</p>
<h3><b>What
we can do for you:</b></h3>
<p>As a new
service in a new age, there are many unique pros in using this tool. Firstly,
you will be able to comprehensively personalize your information so that we may
better serve you as a landlord/tenant. Secondly, there is guaranteed
representation for both parties involved when using this service. </p>
<p>We
will <i>always</i> ensure fair deposit distribution and returns for
the parties involved. </p>
<p>Thirdly,
this service will be user friendly, simple, and available on mobile phones via
our app. Lastly, our service will take many responsibilities and pain points
off the landlord and the tenant. For example, when signing with us, the task of
switching the name under which the utility bill is issued will be left to our
services to handle as opposed to the landlord and the tenant.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b>What
if the goal amount isn't reached?</b></h3>
<p>This
project is already in development and <b>has
an approved patent</b>. If our goal of $40,000 USD isn't reached, any donations
will strictly go to building the App and standing up the core service.</p>
<p><b>Why
will this be valuable?</b></p>
<p>When our
service is fully operational, the impact created will be monumental. </p>
<p>The goal
is to create a new tool for a new age, revolutionizing and reinventing the
process on which the rental market functions:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Creating standards of conduct for
landlords and tenants</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Simplifying and providing security
for both parties in the financial aspects of renting</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Providing equal representation for
all parties involved</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Educating those who are new to
renting </span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Ensuring that there is no gray area
in the guidelines set out by our services</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Simplifying the tasks required today
from landlords and tenants, and in some cases, automating the manual tasks to
help reduce or eliminate certain burdens.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Risks
&amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>As with
any business endeavor, there are obstacles to be overcome. In this instance,
one of our concerns is guaranteeing that any landlord in question is receiving
payment on time and in full, whether it be regarding rent, utilities, damages,
etc. </p>
<p>Another
worry is the introduction of this service. It is brand new and will redefine
the way rental services are handled. We aspire to get the word out and show the
world a new way to handle the rental process. </p>
<p>While
these things do weigh upon us and present a significant hurdle to jump, we are
equipped to address these risks and assuage any worries that may be
presented. </p>
<p>While
studying for his second and third degrees at Gannon University, Ali also
interned at a local law firm. While there, he studied the legal handling of any
rental dispute. Furthermore, he educated himself on the laws and procedures
regarding the rental system that are currently implemented in Pennsylvania. We
feel confident that our team will be able to overcome the financial obstacle
presented. </p>
<p>When it
comes to introducing our service to the rest of the rental community, much of
the advertising will be done during our testing period. During the first four
months of this period, we will work with local landlords. Word of mouth and
personally engaging with landlords will be our main advertisement. This will
allow us to personally witness and address any changes needed to further
perfect our service.</p>
<p>After the
testing period, we plan on branching out and holding a grand opening conference
with local businesses in northwestern Pennsylvania. From there, we will
implement the use of social media and advertisement through business acquired.
Eventually, we will expand the advertisement statewide, giving us more
opportunity to get the word out that we are the new and improved way of
handling the rental process.  From there, we will be able to bring this
benefit nationwide in phases.</p>
<p>Another
solution to introducing this new product will come from the large network we've
created. Being well-traveled and educated, we've amassed a large network of
incredible and successful acquaintances and friends. With their help, we trust
that the introduction of our company will spread like wildfire. </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h3><b>Other
Ways You Can Help</b></h3>
<p>We
recognize that not all people interested in this business venture will be able
to donate, but there are other ways you can help us spread the word that there
is an improved service available on the market! </p>
<p>If you know
of any landlords, tenants, or housing services that might be interested in our
project, please remember to share this opportunity with them via Facebook, the
indiegogo share options, phone call, email, or even a quick plug into your next
social event! </p>

<h3>Blue Sky Longboards, Support A Skateboard Company That Stands For Something Bigger</h3> <p></p>
<p>Blue Sky Longboards needs your help to raise $35,000 to continue building record setting skateboards and doing good for our communities.</p>
<p>Matt Burke founded Blue Sky Longboards in 2011 as a skateboard company with a mission.  That mission is to create the highest quality longboards and give people the tools to support their communities by engaging in charitable fundraising.  The community side of the Blue Sky mission started with the moto of “Pushing Wood and Doin’ Good” which is now the name of the philanthropic initiative at the heart of the company.</p>
<p>Blue Sky’s skateboards are a world class product built with American craftsmanship using American hard maple. Their production partner Chapman Manufacturing, has been featured on CNBC as a great 'Made in America' business, and has helped them develop the ""Timeless Lineup.""  8 permanent shapes that cover all disciplines of skateboarding.  Blue Sky’s team of 20 riders represent the brand around the world. By riding Blue Sky boards they have won their way to the top of many podiums, and set several world records.</p>

Together they skate for 10 miles and raise $1,000 for the charity of the their choice. Not only is this great for the charity but it is fantastic for the kids involved in the push.</p>
<p>Blue Sky Longboards helps foster support for these events by gathering together companies from around the industry to provide awards and incentives to individuals who do the most fundraising.  The Pushing Wood &amp; Doin' Good initiative has already skated countless hours as a community and raised thousands of dollars for youth oriented charities such as STOKED and the A.Skate Foundation.</p>

Blue Sky Longboards needs your help to raise $35,000 to continue building record setting skateboards and doing good for our communities.
Matt Burke founded Blue Sky Longboards in 2011 as a skateboard company with a mission.  That mission is to create the highest quality longboards and give people the tools to support their communities by engaging in charitable fundraising.  The community side of the Blue Sky mission started with the moto of “Pushing Wood and Doin’ Good” which is now the name of the philanthropic initiative at the heart of the company.
Blue Sky’s skateboards are a world class product built with American craftsmanship using American hard maple. Their production partner Chapman Manufacturing, has been featured on CNBC as a great 'Made in America' business, and has helped them develop the ""Timeless Lineup.""  8 permanent shapes that cover all disciplines of skateboarding.  Blue Sky’s team of 20 riders represent the brand around the world. By riding Blue Sky boards they have won their way to the top of many podiums, and set several world records.


The Pushing Wood & Doin' Good initiative is simple; 10 skaters get ten people each to sponsor them for $1 a mile. Together they skate for 10 miles and raise $1,000 for the charity of the their choice. Not only is this great for the charity but it is fantastic for the kids involved in the push.
Blue Sky Longboards helps foster support for these events by gathering together companies from around the industry to provide awards and incentives to individuals who do the most fundraising.  The Pushing Wood & Doin' Good initiative has already skated countless hours as a community and raised thousands of dollars for youth oriented charities such as STOKED and the A.Skate Foundation.



  

Over the next 5 years Blue Sky Longboards plans to expand the Pushing Wood and Doin’ Good initiative to reach the point where it raises over $100,000 for local charities across the country.  The program will grow every year as it reaches out to more communities from coast to coast, providing the incentive and organization for them to fundraise for their communities.  Through these years of development, Blue Sky will help people skate more than 30,000 miles and raise over $250,000 for local charities.


What Blue Sky Needs & Why
Unfortunately, Matt Burke has lost majority ownership of the company that he has been dreaming about for 4 decades. The current owner is backing out and Matt is working to raising $35,000 to buy back the company, pay for the current inventory and move forward with more Pushing Wood & Doing Good events. Without your help, Blue Sky may be finished.Your donations will help keep Blue Sky’s doors open and move forward towards the goal of helping skaters raise $100,000 annually for charities, across the country and around the world.A note from Matt Burke:

""We hope you can make a contribution, but we understand that not everybody can contribute financially. You can still be a critical part of our mission, please share our campaign with any and all of your connections. Our success depends on people like you caring and sharing.""

Side Notes
The founder of Blue Sky is also responsible for creating one of the fastest growing skateboard communities on Facebook. The group is called #showmeatrick      (Show Me A Trick) and already has more than 6,000 members and 5,000 user generated videos uploaded by professional and amateur riders from around the world. This group is a positive place for the next generation to learn new tricks and get pointers from more experienced skaters.

Ebay evaluations I get about my DAC 2 (and the

Why did you design this DAC ?
Nobody can be ""told"" what a good DAC is,
you have to hear it for yourself...

After
searching for the ""perfect"" DAC, I stumbled on forum discussions
about how these ""vintage"" DACs from Phillips sounded so good.
I was getting a little skeptical about those ""natural"" and ""analog""
statements for the sound of those converters, but as so many people
seemed to make converging descriptions, I was left with the feeling
it was not just a legend...

try it for myself !

As the result was more than surprising... I told myself : wow, I got
to show that to my friends...
And what most of my friends said : ""can you build one for me ?""

Why do audiophiles do not like the
sound of current oversampling DACs ?
Oversampling DACs are textbook correct, right
? So they should sound perfect, no ? Well ...

While it is true that oversampling DACs are textbook correct, if
you make the wrong assumptions about the human hearing system,
you may end up making mistakes, even if you do the math right !

Let me give you a simple example : it is generally assumed we
hear the spectrum of sounds, but can't hear the phase.
Now try ""binaural beats"" on Google and listen for yourself.
These clearly show the phase information IS sensed, AND remains

So maybe the spectrum-only approach to DAC design is not

replicate in analog what you fed them digitally as closely as

Facebook page that went from zero to thousands of fans in 72 hours. MAUIWatch’s
popularity quickly dwarfed that of other news sites and government agencies
specific to Maui County.




Today,
MAUIWatch reaches over 100,000 people a month and have out grown our technical
infrastructure. We started out with the typical cheap web hosting services you
see all over the internet ranging from $5 to $15 a-month. We have outgrown this
service by leaps and bounds and now require a dedicated web hosting solution.
The cost to upgrade not only requires hardware and equipment but system
administration staff to configure and administer the website.

Just 24
hours ago while breaking news of a shooting in Wailuku took place, the spike in
web traffic was more than our servers could bear and the system crashed leaving
many of you with system error messages. Thousands of residents rely on
MAUIWatch and at this stage of growth, it will take a more significant
financial obligation to stem the rising tide. 

We humbly
ask for your support. If can, Can. If no can, No Can. Regardless. MAUIWatch
will continue to provide you with the best breaking news coverage the best way
we can.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>We aren't designed to function alone in this world. We're meant to help each other out, stand up for each other, protect each other, and give of ourselves. I've spent my whole life giving my time and energy to those I love, sacrificing my own needs and desires to make other people happy. I want to give more. But I have very limited resources, and right now I am barely staying afloat. Ironically, with the best job I've ever had, I am now in an income bracket that disqualifies me from the free medical care I was getting under the AAC. Now that I have a decent job, I can't afford the chiropractic care, physical therapy, and psychotherapy that I need in order to just be able to function like a normal human being. I can't buy a house that doesn't have a leaky roof and holes in the floor like the 1975 trailer we're currently living in.  I can't help my kids, as they become adults and venture into the world. I can't help my youngest child, who has two life-threatening medical conditions and ongoing medical expenses. I can't help my community, or the women like me who have found themselves stuck in an abusive marriage and need help getting out. </div>
<div>I want to help. But in order to be able to help people, first I need your help. </div>
<div>Help me build a graphic design computer and buy a subscription to Adobe Cloud, so I can start my own business and get some extra income so I can help the people who need it. Help me put my education to use and bring some light to those around me. Help me make the world a better place.</div> </div> <div> <h3>I need a workstation and Adobe Cloud.</h3>
<div>A good graphic design computer will cost me around $1300. This includes all the hardware and a monitor.</div>
<div>A high quality negative scanner will cost me around $700. This is important for doing any kind of photo restoration or work from negatives, as well as allowing me to scan actual photographs.</div>
<div>An annual subscription to Adobe Cloud will cost around $960. </div>
<div>A 24"" large format inkjet printer will cost me around $1300. This is not including paper and ink cartridges.</div>
<div>I figure $5,000 will get me started. One or two projects will keep me going.</div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>I have lofty goals.</h3>
<div>Of course, my main goal is to be able to provide a better life for myself and my family. I'm tired of living in poverty. I work full time and still don't have enough money to deal with the  normal situations life throws at me like home and auto repairs, illness, kids' field trips for school, etc. When buying school clothes and healthy food is a challenge to my budget, you can forget about luxuries like family vacations or even going to the movies.</div>
<div>But more than just giving my family a better life, I want to make the world a better place. I want to reach out into my community and give something back. I want to help women who are feeling scared, trapped, helpless. I want to lift up those who have fallen, and help them find their way into the light. My dream is to provide outreach and education for the general public, to help change society and how we deal with issues like domestic violence, poverty, and hatred. I want to help poor families get food, and have access to services. I want to do good things in the world. </div>
<div>Starting my own business will give me the means to give *more* to my community. I will be able to really, truly, make the world a better place. Not just for my kids, but for everyone. Even if I don't reach my fundraising goal, the money will go toward starting that dream. And if I only raise $20, the money will go into my gas tank. (sorry, have to be honest)</div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>I'm supposed to talk about risks &amp; challenges.</h3>
<div>There is always a risk of failure. There is a risk that life will happen, as it usually does. There is the risk that I'm not who I say I am, and that your money will go to fund a gun-smuggling operation out of Saskatoon. I can't promise you I will succeed in my attempt to start my own business. I can't promise you my business will be profitable. But I can promise you I won't smuggle any guns - and that I will work my ass off to make this dream a reality.  With your help, I can do it.</div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you aren't comfortable donating cash, or if you don't have any to donate, that's OK. You can still help by sharing this link with your circle, in case any of your friends have spare cash lying around gathering dust. Hey, you might make their day, cleaning up a little extra space in their piggy banks! :)</p>

Oyooni is a non-profit organisation. All donations and funds raised go directly to the purchase of equipment. 
Oyooni aims to deliver effective treatment to the silent forgotten majority sufferers of diabetes in Palestine.

Recently affected by a major Earth quake, the country is now rebuilding and the work of its courageaous artisans is one of its most important source of income. Help us make a difference!Support the development of Organic Cotton clothing. Our Cotton is a soft, bidodegradable and natural fiber. We chose to work only with Organic Cotton because conventionally-grown cotton uses 25% of the world's chemical pesticides (USDA, 2000). Less than 2% of the world’s cotton production is Organic. Choosing Organic Cotton helps protect soils, air, water and workers.Anjuna (center) with Rakhi, Chandrakala, Pandey and Apsala, our  friends and coordination team in Nepal. WHO WE ARE Francis had 8 years experience with fair trade producers in Nepal and India. When he met Anjuna, a visual artist and project manager, they became lovers, and travelled together. In Nepal, they built a partnership with skilfull artisans  to produce eclectic fair trade clothing. The ADRIA Mode project was born. Back home, they developped a network of over 150 stores who distribute their clothing in Canada and the US. . ""I design
clothing for active women who like to create their own style and colors in accordance to their core values. My parents and family were artisans, we
lived in an ecological house and had a big Organic garden. This project is very close to my hearth."" - Anjuna, Designer FAIR TRADE CLOTHING Handcrafted details and handmade prints make our designs distinctive. They are made by talented handcrafters in the Himalayas.  ""When I work with them, I feel like being back with my family. They are kind and authentic people."" - AnjunaWe work and live with these people a few months per year. It was important for us to make sure they earn fair and sustainable living wages. The Fairtrade Federation logo on our clothing recognized our efforts to respect the women and men who produce our clothing. More info on : www.fairtradefederation.org/CHOOSING ORGANICFor us, taking care of our planet and
our health is as important as wearing nice looking clothes we feel good in. This
is why we chose to design with Organic fabrics. Our Organic Cotton is a soft,
biodegradable and low-impact fabric. We use water-based handmade prints and
recycle production cut-outs to make details. Our labels are also printed on hand-made sustainable fiber paper. Learn more about our certified

Our first fundraising goal was to reach $5000 which we recently achieved on June 5th, 2015. Now, with this IndieGogo, we plan to raise an additional $5000, for a total of $10,000, to make this space a reality.<br/><br/>In 2015 we secured our Non-Profit 501(c)(3) status as a charitable organization for public purposes.

<p>Growing up in Orange County we were used to the fact that if you wanted to see good, live music that’s accessible to everyone you would have to drive all the way to LA or San Diego. The only other opportunities this area has for its youth is playing inside bars or getting taken advantage of in “pay-to-play” scenarios. Having a good place to express and show art in front of peers within a trusted community is something we don't just need in this area, but something our young artists and entire community deserves. </p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Keeping a space like this requires a strong adherence to our regulations on being a safer, sober, drug free environment.</li>
<li>To ensure that we're always bringing in and supporting new artists we require constant outreach and ways for people from the community to program their own events</li>
<li>We are a space that runs on volunteers. Without a reliable staff for each event we would not be able to continue hosting events for the public. </li> </ul>
<div>We are confident in our ability to tackle all of these problems by our extensive experience with show running in and outside of the organization. We now have a dedicated staff that works specifically with volunteers, a community manager that works with individuals looking to propose events, and a designated booker to keep tabs on new and upcoming artists looking for a place to play. <br/><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FFzxgHUTmccM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DFzxgHUTmccM%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FFzxgHUTmccM%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><br/>Communicating our rules and regulations to our audience before entering the space is key to having an understanding with our guests.

To ensure that we're always bringing in and supporting new artists we require constant outreach and ways for people from the community to program their own events
We are a space that runs on volunteers. Without a reliable staff for each event we would not be able to continue hosting events for the public.  
We are confident in our ability to tackle all of these problems by our extensive experience with show running in and outside of the organization. We now have a dedicated staff that works specifically with volunteers, a community manager that works with individuals looking to propose events, and a designated booker to keep tabs on new and upcoming artists looking for a place to play. Communicating our rules and regulations to our audience before entering the space is key to having an understanding with our guests. We list our rules and codes of conduct outside all of our events so that guests can be aware of our rules, why they exist, and their consequences if unmet, before entering our space.

Rather than see this as the end of the road for FiM, we see it as a bright new opportunity, but one we will need to approach together.     FiM has already made a tremendous impact in our community, and we are committed to continuing this work. We have found some potential new locations in Murrieta, and now we just need to raise some funds to make sure we can survive the move. Your support will enable us to rebuild our largest structures and compensate our coaches for their time rebuilding, since the entire construction project will be done by our staff.

Ayurvedic therapist and yoga instructor. I am starting a small business called
Ayuela Beauté in my hometown of Utsunomiya, Japan. The space will have a
yoga studio, massage room and a retail area for natural beauty products,
clothing and jewelry.  I am starting this campaign in order to raise funds
for opening the business by March next year. </span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica; color: #1F1F1F;"">Since my late teens I have always been
involved in the hair and beauty industry and my passion for it took me to New
York.  After many years working as a stylist I opened Ueno Salon on
Mulberry street in 2002 and another branch soon after in the east village. Both
were very successful and it was as if all my dreams came true but I still felt
something missing. It was after an emergency room visit for an allergic
reaction that I soon focused on health and lifestyle changes. I was introduced
to Ayurveda, a 5,000 year old healing system from India. It promotes health and
well-being through the balance of mind, body and spirit. I took courses and
classes in esthetics and ayurveda but still wanted to experience more… </span></p>

New York to pursue this new direction…I dreamed of a place to share in reconnecting
to our true inner beauty through health and happiness.  This took me first
to Paris then India where I enrolled in an Ayurvedic Health care center and
received certification as a therapist. I then moved to Hawaii to study massage
therapy and took a teacher training course for Yoga. </span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica; color: #1F1F1F;"">Returning to Japan I found that my search
for a place to open Ayuela Beaute brought me back to family, to friends… it
brought me back home. </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica; color: #1F1F1F;""> </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica; color: #1F1F1F;"">Ayuela Beaute is almost there but not
without you. It is through you that this dream becomes reality and in return I
offer my thanks and appreciation through our campaign perks. </span></p>

my Story
Hello my name is Yoko and I am an
Ayurvedic therapist and yoga instructor. I am starting a small business called
Ayuela Beauté in my hometown of Utsunomiya, Japan. The space will have a
yoga studio, massage room and a retail area for natural beauty products,
clothing and jewelry.  I am starting this campaign in order to raise funds
for opening the business by March next year. 
 
My passion in life has always been beauty
and my focus in Ayuela Beauté is to share the joy of living beautifully. 
 
Since my late teens I have always been
involved in the hair and beauty industry and my passion for it took me to New
York.  After many years working as a stylist I opened Ueno Salon on
Mulberry street in 2002 and another branch soon after in the east village. Both
were very successful and it was as if all my dreams came true but I still felt
something missing. It was after an emergency room visit for an allergic
reaction that I soon focused on health and lifestyle changes. I was introduced
to Ayurveda, a 5,000 year old healing system from India. It promotes health and
well-being through the balance of mind, body and spirit. I took courses and
classes in esthetics and ayurveda but still wanted to experience more… 
 
I closed both salons and decided to leave
New York to pursue this new direction…I dreamed of a place to share in reconnecting
to our true inner beauty through health and happiness.  This took me first
to Paris then India where I enrolled in an Ayurvedic Health care center and
received certification as a therapist. I then moved to Hawaii to study massage
therapy and took a teacher training course for Yoga. 
 
Returning to Japan I found that my search
for a place to open Ayuela Beaute brought me back to family, to friends… it
brought me back home. 
 
Ayuela Beaute is almost there but not
without you. It is through you that this dream becomes reality and in return I
offer my thanks and appreciation through our campaign perks. 
 
I am offering ayurvedic massage, yoga
classes and am very excited to offer merchandise from LOUISE MANNA Jewelry and
ANA, both of whom I will also be collaborating with for a future line of yoga
inspired fashion wear and gear.
 
Once again I thank you for sharing this
dream with me…

Live beautifully. 
 
Domo arigato.

Caring for your new ana:  Color migration may occur when washing. Please wash gently and
separately from others. If color migration happens on white-based fabrics,
washing a few times is recommended to remove stained colors from white part.


お手入れ: お洗濯の際に色移りする場合がございます。他のものと分けて丁寧な手洗いをおすすめします。白調のアフリカ布の色の部分が白い部分に色移りした場合は、その後何回かお洗濯をすると色移りを落とす事ができます。

</ul> </div> <div style=""text-align: justify;""> <h3>What We Need </h3> <p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">$65,000 to build a sustainable, food-based community center. Since we're bringing with us almost four years of steadily increasing sales, marketing, menu development, and customer loyalty, most of your contributions will go directly to expansion of services and rejuvenation. Below is the  break-out of what your generosity and direct involvement will create. We decided to aim high, laying out the whole shebang, and giving you all the details of what it's going to take to reach our ultimate destination. We don't need the entire fundraising goal to keep the doors open but every extra dollar that you give is a critical piece in constructing a strong business capable of consistently giving back to the community that built it. </span></p>
<ul>
<li>Overhead Costs during the transition to The Blue Phoenix and for the first three months of operation $6,000: rent, utilities, licensing, insurance, etc.</li>
<li>Equipment &amp; Structural Improvements $5,000: we're trying to purchase and re-purpose as much equipment, shelving, counters, and physical assets from Healthy Foods as possible. It helps them close financially solvent and it helps us keep expansion costs low. There are a few items, like a new display cooler for our meal kits, that we'll have to purchase outright.</li>
<li>Labor $5,000: we're planning on putting a lot of sweat equity into our new business, but there are some projects that require expert help and we're going to need cash on hand to pay our talented area craftsmen and helpers.</li>
<li>Inventory and Ingredients $12,000: it's time to fill the shelves (and the kitchen), preferably with as much locally sourced products and produce as we can find. Here is where we get to take your dollars and invest them right back into the community. </li>
<li>Point of Sale System $3,000: this will help us keep track of sales and inventory more accurately, speed up the checkout process, and provide better customer service and kitchen efficiency.</li>
<li>Payroll $12,000: it takes a significant investment to recruit and train an awesome staff and it's very, VERY important to us that our business model is strong enough to achieve and sustain a living wage for every single employee. </li>
<li>Advertising $2,000: although we'll be doing some paid social media advertising, most of our advertising budget will go to ads and sponsorships placed with athletic or academic groups, non-profits, and other similar organizations in our area. We want our marketing to count for more than just getting the word out and keeping our money local helps achieve that goal.</li>
<li>Total Kitchen Renovation $20,000: this is the biggie, so we've saved it for last. Our cafe kitchen is charmingly shabby with its DIY, patched together, punk appeal, but it's literally coming apart at the seams. Here's the short list of what needs to happen: expand the total space, install a commercial hood with fire suppression system, remove and replace the floor, install a backsplash, purchase and install new worktops, sandwich prep unit, stove and grill, paint, and raise the dish sink.</li>

Main Street was home to three groceries, a hardware store, a pharmacy, and even a small department store. It was a thriving market place built for and sustained by the local populace. I want to see those stores return. I want to help build a local economy that supplies basic, daily needs in addition to the draw of beautiful boutiques and elegant restaurants. </p>
<p>Keeping the doors open to the last downtown grocery is a deliberate, socioeconomic investment and radical display of local activism. Our continued operation, our growth and viability, is a vital step in building a resilient downtown and network of personally invested, connected individuals. The resurgence of needs-based Main Street businesses encourages people to put down the screen, leave their car at home, keep money local, and deepen ties with other residents. </p>
<p>I'm a child of the technology era. I've never known a time without computers. I have a smartphone, tablet, and laptop. I'm hyper-connected just like most of you and I love all my technological tools. I'm using them to achieve a crowdfunding goal right now. But if all that technology went away tomorrow, what would we have left? </p>
<p>I want that answer to include a community where I can walk down the street to pick up groceries, household supplies, a prescription, lunch with a colleague, coffee with a friend, and know that if I'm running late my neighbor two houses down can watch my child until I get home. </p>
<p>I want to live in a world nurtured with trust, authenticity, and equity. Four years ago I left a stable, secure, but demoralizing job to go work at a tiny health food store where the pay was terrible, the work challenging, and t<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">he future tenuous.

<h3><b>What is i74? </b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>i74 </b>is a legislative proposal initiated by the citizens of Romania via article 74 of the Romanian Constitution – which allows 100.000 citizens to introduce a law into Parliament. i74 aims to reform the functioning of the Parliament of Romania by closing loopholes in the current legislation defining Parliamentary activity, along three main lines:</p>
<p>a. Ensuring transparency and traceability of votes in the Parliament</p>
<p>b. Establishing clear rules for expenditures by elected Members of Parliament </p>
<p>c. Penalising unexcused absences from plenary meetings</p>
<p>d. Promoting transparency in hiring practices and in the management of public resources</p>
<p></p>
<p>The initiative was born within the CAESAR Foundation and has been widely embraced by the public, having gathered 15,000 virtual signatures in the first 15 days after its launch. It has so far mobilized close to 1,000 volunteers.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>i74 is the first grassroots legislative initiative in Romania’s democratic history after the 1989 Revolution that goes through all stages required by law – from drafting, to collecting 100.000 signatures and being voted upon in the Parliament. Besides much-needed impact on current legislation, i74’s vision is to empower citizens to take ownership of a country that has been affected by corruption, lack of transparency, and a political class completely disconnected from voters. i74 aims to inspire citizens to take action and realize the potential of citizen involvement in the everyday functioning of democracy.</p>

Ce este i74?
Inițiativa legislativă a Fundației CAESAR are la bază Articolului 74 din Constituţia României.

Conform Art. 74, „(1) Iniţiativa legislativă aparţine, după caz, Guvernului, deputaţilor, senatorilor sau unui număr de cel puţin 100.000 de cetăţeni cu drept de vot.”
Cum ne propunem să reușim?
Prin a strânge, împreună, peste 100.000 de semnături din cel puțin 11 judeţe, fiecare cu cel puțin 5.000 de semnatari. Proiectul de lege va ajunge atunci pe masa Parlamentului, în primăvara anului viitor. Obiectivul este ca legea să fie adoptată înainte de alegerile parlamentare din 2016.
De ce i74?
Pentru că fiecare român își dorește să aibă pe cine să voteze, nu împotriva cui să voteze. Pentru ca acest lucru să se întâmple, avem nevoie de conducători care să ne reprezinte interesele de cetățeni în Parlament.
Ce aduce nou i74?
1. Transparență - Voturi la vedere, accesibile tuturor cetățenilor, ca să ştim cum suntem reprezentaţi.
2. Seriozitate – Fiecare absență nemotivată să fie sancționată cu 1% din salariu. Deoarece parlamentarii trebuie să știe că nu se joacă pe timpul nostru.
3. Responsabilitate – Decontări de cheltuieli doar pe bază de documente justificative. Declarația pe proprie răspundere nu va mai fi suficientă, pentru că banul public e banul nostru și nu poate fi cheltuit oricum.

But we need help getting them turning

We are Nicole and Andrew, coffee and tea lovers with an entrepreneurial spirit. I have been dreaming of opening up a coffee shop for years and with Andrew's design skills and my love for DIY adventures, we finally took the plunge and began building Nomad Coffee in late 2015.
Nomad is a mobile coffee shop located in Vermont. We are on a mission to bring good coffee to the bedroom communities of the greater Burlington area. We want to make your morning commute and weekend outings a happier one.  But we are not quite there yet, we could use your help to get us rolling and brewing.
    What We Need You can be a part of getting great coffee to your neighborhood!We need to raise $15,700 to purchase:


La Marzocco espresso machine


Brew Batch machine, Grinders and accessories

Permits & Licenses


Refrigerator, water tank, filtration system and sinks


Generator

Plumbing & Electrical





The PerksThere is a little something something for everyone who donates. We have..

Magnets
Drink tokens
Nomad etched mugs
Nomad T-shirts

1/2 bags of Coffee from our friends at Brio Coffeeworks or Tea from Vermont Artisan Coffee & Tea Co

And Coffee Events/Parties with Nomad and goodies from Jam Bakery

We've also just introduced (as of July 12) a 'Pitch Your Perk' option.  Don't see what you'd like above? Or want something for a different price?  Send us an email at hello@nomadcoffeevt.com with your desired perk and what you are willing to contribute and we'll get back to you within a day. Maybe you want to be the hero at work and bring Nomad to your office?  Pitch it!
We look forward to hearing from your ideas!

If we don't reach our campaign goal we will still use all the generated funds to help us purchase our equipment. Every little bit helps us get to our launch date sooner.

<p>  So  why farming, why now, why heritage breeds, and why Sterlingshire for a name.  My husband and I both come from farming families- a few generations back- and although it may seem crazy to some people (including a few of our family members) we decided last year that we wanted to break out of the subdivision as our kids are now in their teens and buy a farm.  Not a commercial operation, but a small family farm raising heritage breeds naturally- with lots of forage, sunshine,  fresh water, and chemical free.  </p>
<p>We have chosen to raise heritage breed livestock on our farm, these breeds were once very popular with our ancestors and most were brought over from Ireland, Scotland, England and other countries in Europe.  These breeds hail from a time when animals foraged in pasture and woodlands and are well adapted for small farms.  These breeds do not mature or produce rapidly and therefore were passed over by commercial farmers.  Many of these breeds are now endangered as they lost favor after WWII.  These breeds (pigs, goats, chickens, ducks, turkeys and cows) are hardy animals with a taste that rivals anything you have ever bought from a grocery store.  </p>
<p>Sterlingshire Farm came through our deep connections with family.  I lost my mother as a young girl and  I wanted to learn everything about her family.  After lots of searching and the help of Ancestor.com I came to discover my mother's family (both sides) were from Scotland.  One side came from a village known as Stirlingshire.  It was an ah-hah moment and the farm's name was created.  So join us as try, fail and try again to create a sustainable farm for our family and naturally raised meat for our community. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Sterlingshire Farm Barn Raising </h3> <p>As we have built the farm over the last year it became very apparent that a barn is needed.  We currently have 12 goats on the farm, 8 fainting goats and 4 dairy goats, 6 Ameracauna chickens and 6 Rhode Island red chickens. In the spring we would like to add heritage pig breeds especially the mulefoot pig and the old spot pig.  The barn will allow our goats to kid and the pigs to farrow safely during the winter- as we do not prescribe to a breeding program- kids can come during any month.</p>
<p>In days gone by when a neighbor needed a barn built, the community came together to help raise the barn.  Crowdfunding has put a new spin on this task but the outcome is the same- we need your help.   Please consider a donation to our barn raising effort.  </p>

</span></p><p>Due to a scarcity of irrigation water in the region, in December 2013 we took out
a loan in pesos, offered by the government, to buy an irrigation system worth
USD 50,000. In February 2014, the economy in Argentina took an unexpected hit,
the peso was devalued and hence the value of our loan fell to roughly USD
30,000.  Suddenly we found ourselves USD 19,500 short of what we needed to
finish paying for the system.</p>

The government demands that the system be fully installed by
the end of 2015. <p></p>
<p>We have two alternatives. Pay the suppliers USD 19,500 to finish
installing the irrigation system. Or sell the land and pay the USD 50,000 back
to the government.</p><p></p><div>Selling the farm would be the easy way out for the Quiros family, who own the land. The farm today is worth considerably more than what they paid for it 4 years ago.

<p>The Quirós Family is comprised by Laura, Osvaldo , Paulo and
I. We have been involved in every detail right from the birth of the community
of Terranea.</p>
<p>Roxana and Julieta are independent winemakers who choose the
grapes they like and buy the small batches they need at fair prices. Once a
year, we organize a tasting to savor the delicious wines they make.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446079005/ubk2eg5cqdafgfkyfvor.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>The rest of the community is comprised of about 30 dedicated local
families who work in the vineyard and in the olive groves at different times of
the year. They are in charge of irrigation, floor management, pruning, leafing,
green thinning, canopy management, regular testing, and fertilization
activities.</p>
<p>Looking after the environment is our parents and grandparents
legacy. It is how they interpreted life back then. They treated nature with
respect and care and in return they lived happier, healthier, simpler and more

</div></div>","- We want friends and world travelers to get an
immersive experience in our culture. We
just need a bit of financing to meet a deadline and to take our project to scale. Please take a minute to read
about what we are doing. - OUR STORY

Terranea is a community that has been growing grapes and olives for more than 4 years in Mendoza, Argentina.
We are running a 30-day crowdfunding campaign to meet a critical deadline. We need to finish paying for our irrigation system by late November 2015.Our purpose is to protect the vineyards and the olive groves, and to ensure the agricultural jobs of dedicated men and women, currently a total of 30 families.Our vision and motivation is to share our local knowledge, activities, experience, and skills with friends and world travelers.
THE PROBLEM
Due to a scarcity of irrigation water in the region, in December 2013 we took out
a loan in pesos, offered by the government, to buy an irrigation system worth
USD 50,000. In February 2014, the economy in Argentina took an unexpected hit,
the peso was devalued and hence the value of our loan fell to roughly USD
30,000.  Suddenly we found ourselves USD 19,500 short of what we needed to
finish paying for the system.

The government demands that the system be fully installed by
the end of 2015. 
We have two alternatives. Pay the suppliers USD 19,500 to finish
installing the irrigation system. Or sell the land and pay the USD 50,000 back
to the government.Selling the farm would be the easy way out for the Quiros family, who own the land. The farm today is worth considerably more than what they paid for it 4 years ago. That is so because developers may now build residences in our area, and that creates land speculation. These speculators are paying growers far higher prices than the real value of the agricultural land.But if this happens, the developers that plan to buy
the farm will fire all the workers, and rip out the vineyards and the olive
trees.
Your support is
a tool to change that
Your
support will unlock opportunity for the community and have a positive
environmental and social impact.

Your support will help Santos, Maria, Jose, Ezequiel, Roberto
and other community members, portrayed in the pictures, from having to migrate
to the city with their families in search of any kind of job they can find.They have lived in this region and worked on the land for
generations. They belong here.
Your support will also help to prevent the developers from ripping
out the olive trees and the vineyards of our farm, which is located in Maipú, Mendoza,
a wine region with unique soil and weather conditions.
¨Mendoza is considered the heart of the winemaking industry in Argentina¨ - and - ¨the principal
wine producing areas - of Mendoza - fall into two main departments, Maipú and
Luján,  which include Argentina's first
delineated appellation.THE COMMUNITY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
Santos is the vineyard master and he is vital to our
operations. We all collaborate so he can have housing, utilities, and health
care at the farm. He has truly earned it; he is one of the most honest and
hardworking individuals I´ve ever known.


Negra is Santos´ life companion. She is a street
dog who is eternally grateful to have been saved from starvation by Santos.

The Quirós Family is comprised by Laura, Osvaldo , Paulo and
I. We have been involved in every detail right from the birth of the community
of Terranea.
Roxana and Julieta are independent winemakers who choose the
grapes they like and buy the small batches they need at fair prices. Once a
year, we organize a tasting to savor the delicious wines they make.
The rest of the community is comprised of about 30 dedicated local
families who work in the vineyard and in the olive groves at different times of
the year. They are in charge of irrigation, floor management, pruning, leafing,
green thinning, canopy management, regular testing, and fertilization
activities.
Looking after the environment is our parents and grandparents
legacy. It is how they interpreted life back then. They treated nature with
respect and care and in return they lived happier, healthier, simpler and more
rewarding lives.HOW WE PLAN TO MOVE FORWARD
Terranea is based in a 14-acre property where we currently
grow grapes and olives in a sustainable
manner.Adam and Laura and their children, León and Lucia live at our
farm. They support and work closely together with local growers of organic
fresh fruits and vegetables, which they supply to families and restaurants in
Mendoza.The farm is in transition to become full organic with Adam´s professional advice and support.As a complementary income activity, we´ve been preparing to
offer world travelers a place to relax among the vineyards, enjoy mouthwatering
homemade dishes and savor delicious wines.We have decided to embark on this pursuit together with other
growers in the area that are all part of colonia El Zorzal, a colony that was
founded more than 70 years ago. Our ultimate goal was to gain municipal
recognition, which we achieved in August 2014 when colonia El Zorzal was
formally presented as a tourism destination.
On our side, we are proud to announce that as of August 2015,
Terranea was awarded with a municipal permission for tourism activities on our
farm. 
Expertise,
support and commitment
Santos´ expertise with farm management and his ability to
choose the right people for each farming activity has been the key to the
amazing progress we have already achieved in the vineyard and the olive groves.
My personal experience helped in gathering the community,
dealing with private and government institutions and negotiating with buyers
and suppliers.
I will use my marketing background and the support of the
Ministry of Tourism of Mendoza to position our farm as a benchmark of the ¨back
to the roots experience¨.
We have developed a strategy to offer tourists an alternative
to the classic experience they get at wineries and vineyards in the different
wine regions they visit around the world.
We are passionate about sharing our local knowledge,
activities, experience, and skills to connect directly with friends and world travelers.
They get an immersive experience while we gain opportunity to support our
community. Terranea will offer visitors gourmet products handcrafted by
us and by the other members of colonia El Zorzal. Today among other delights we
can offer freshly baked bread and empanadas, organic wines, tomato paste and
olives, and plum and cherry preserves.

<p><b>Our Goal $67000</b></p><p><b>
</b></p><p>
</p><p>My farm is failing not because plants don't
grow or I can't sell my goods. I sell out every week and I have run out of hoop
house space to grow. It's failing because of transportation costs. I need more
hoop houses and produce to make the trip to market more cost effective. We
spend $2000.00 each month on transportation and are behind on all our bills. We
are tapped out we have put every dollar we have into this farm. We have a clear
goal to expand. We can't do this without your help. I know we are asking for a
lot from the public, but if you look at what the farm gives back its really
worth it. We try to live as green as we can. We are a net help to the
environment by sequestering carbon by growing good food and composting. Food
that is free of harmful pesticides.</p>
<p>I read all the time, not as much as I would
like to, the farm comes second after family so those two keep us busy. I read
just the other day that your food travels 3000 miles on average before you get
to eat it. That's a long ways. What happens in that time period to the food? My
food only has to travel 150 miles.</p>
<p>I need your support so we can continue to do
this work of feeding the world good food and responsible food. Las Vegas is a
world vacation point, so we really do help feed the world with our little farm.
</p>
<p>Please donate to our indigogo campaign and I
promise I will do my part to bring great food to the world.</p><p><b>The Plan</b><br/></p>
<b>
</b><p>A new Government program Rodney helped develop, has been introduced to expand micro farms! <br/></p><p> It
 allows micro farms to purchase up to $50000 each year of equipment that will help the farm conserve water, which translates 
to 5 Hoop Houses a year, and then reimburses us for a large percentage of our expense.  So once we get the 
first 5 Hoop Houses, we will be able to purchase 5 more next year, and 
the year after that, and the year after that!  Simply put, more hoop 
houses means more produce in the truck.</p>To support the new hoop houses, we need to upgrade our well and add irrigation lines, $6000<br/>Perks, Video, Marketing and fees  $11000<br/><br/>Your investment in our Indiegogo campaign will allow
us to continue to grow our business each year and to provide an ever growing supply of fresh organic produce to the restaurants and people in the Las Vegas Community.<br/><p><b>

</p><p><b>Our Story <b>( Our Mission, Our Dream)</b><br/></b></p><p>Blue Lizard Farm is our home. Ten years ago we owned an Africanized Bee Removal company in Las Vegas. When it became obvious that Rodney's health was suffering from the continuous pesticide exposure we knew it was time to leave the city and find a simpler, healthier life for ourselves and our children. Rodney has kept bees since his early twenties, and we thought at first that we would return to full-time beekeeping, as we had done in Southern Arizona. However, his continuing work as the beekeeper for UNLV's biology department kept us within weekly commuting distance, which meant staying in the Great Basin Desert, the stark beauty of which lacks the rich biodiversity of the Sonoran Desert we'd known before. Not an ideal beekeeping area. Still, we were drawn to Lincoln county because of its beauty, the cooler weather, and the very rural atmosphere. We were able to purchase ten acres of utterly unimproved sagebrush desert and we set to work. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437155047/sishihjbqnzhhtxx50ty.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Everything you see on the farm today was put there by our own hands. We brought in the electric, put in the well, installed the plumbing and septic, built the buildings, and developed the soil. Our native soil is nearly sterile and low in organic matter, something uncomfortably close to gardening the moon. It took years of trial and error before we could feed ourselves. Without the hoop houses it would be difficult just to do that. Our local NRCS (Natural Resource Conservation Service, a branch of the USDA) agent was walking our place a year or so ago and he said ""You know, if you'd asked me before you did this if it could have been done here, on this ground, I'd have told you you were nuts."" <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437155080/j5ui5r2rtupo2x9zylju.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>When we began working the bugs out of the system, Rodney started taking samples of our produce to chefs in Las Vegas, particularly the chefs who work for Mario Batali at his restaurants in the Venetian and the Palazzo.

We added 12 steel frame 20x96 hoop houses and built a cleaning and packaging facility that is a fully state inspected commercial kitchen. Dealing primarily with leafy greens, we are aware of the potential risks and wanted to be able to ensure our customers, both wholesale and retail, a safe, wholesome, properly handled product that they could serve with confidence. We bought a refrigerated box truck to bring the fruit of our labors to the city. That loan required us to put up every thing we own as collateral. <br/><br/>Three years later we find that the cost of transportation is eating up every penny of profit. Our lender has been patient as we try to find a solution, but we must show that it is possible to increase our production enough to be viable by next spring. To be viable we have grow more vegetables. We have the demand. Every week we have orders we can't fill because there just isn't enough to go around. Every additional pound of spinach, or kale, or beets, or tomatoes we can add to the truck spreads the cost of the trip and increases the profit margin. Hoop houses are the key to our operation. They help us to take the edge off of our four main environmental hurdles: cold winters, hot summers, relentless winds, and wildlife.

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>I am a skater and my passion runs deep for the culture that has helped shaped the positive person I have become today. I love being a part of the skate community and that is why I have helped it from building urban skate spots to helping the youth get sponsors. I want to further help the skate community by offering a personal place for them to buy their skateboard goods. I live near a place where there is not a single skate shop in the local area. This area spans to three towns total. There are many skaters here, from all walks of life, and they all deserve to have a skate shop that they can call their second home.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434740674/wb737fmfymm2bxps2h9u.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>El Sereno Skaters learning how to build their own ledge. We take part in the effort to build stronger communities.<br/>
<b>The Spill</b><br/> <p>I am 30 years old and have an awesome family and friends. The skate community is one of the best sub cultures to belong to. We are passionate, creative and we all share the enjoyment of skating.<b> I first got into skating when I was 9 years old,  going to the local skate shop to buy my first board was life changing and the impression it left on me still echoes today</b>. I feel like many kids today are missing out on that experience, because they either buy their skateboards online or from a Mall shop that has no personal connection to it's customers. <br/></p>
<p>I want to bring the <b>personal experience</b> back to those connected to skateboarding weather you are a beginner or an old vert dawg. That is why I am asking friends, family, strangers, and the skate community overall to contribute to the opening of <b>Underground Skate Supply</b>. Your time and/or donations will help open the doors to thousands of skaters from South Pasadena/El Sereno/Alhambra area. There <b>currently is not a skate shop in the entire city of Alhambra and South Pasadena</b>, although South Pasadena has a skate park and their thousands of skaters in the surrounding area. This shop will go beyond just selling skateboard equipment and clothes. It will offer workshop classes on how to shoot skateboard photography, how to build your own DIY spot and much more. I will also advocate for a skate park in Alhambra, which currently does not have a skate park. I want to be connected with the skate and residential community and bring positive change to the kids of these areas.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What the Skate Shop Needs &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>At this point I need funding of about $ 8,000 for inventory, leasing options, in-shop equipment, skateboard racks, display cases, cosmetic upgrades to the location, and shop brand apparel and items.

</div></div>","The Story
I am a skater and my passion runs deep for the culture that has helped shaped the positive person I have become today. I love being a part of the skate community and that is why I have helped it from building urban skate spots to helping the youth get sponsors. I want to further help the skate community by offering a personal place for them to buy their skateboard goods. I live near a place where there is not a single skate shop in the local area. This area spans to three towns total. There are many skaters here, from all walks of life, and they all deserve to have a skate shop that they can call their second home.


El Sereno Skaters learning how to build their own ledge. We take part in the effort to build stronger communities.
The Spill I am 30 years old and have an awesome family and friends. The skate community is one of the best sub cultures to belong to. We are passionate, creative and we all share the enjoyment of skating. I first got into skating when I was 9 years old,  going to the local skate shop to buy my first board was life changing and the impression it left on me still echoes today. I feel like many kids today are missing out on that experience, because they either buy their skateboards online or from a Mall shop that has no personal connection to it's customers. 
I want to bring the personal experience back to those connected to skateboarding weather you are a beginner or an old vert dawg. That is why I am asking friends, family, strangers, and the skate community overall to contribute to the opening of Underground Skate Supply. Your time and/or donations will help open the doors to thousands of skaters from South Pasadena/El Sereno/Alhambra area. There currently is not a skate shop in the entire city of Alhambra and South Pasadena, although South Pasadena has a skate park and their thousands of skaters in the surrounding area. This shop will go beyond just selling skateboard equipment and clothes. It will offer workshop classes on how to shoot skateboard photography, how to build your own DIY spot and much more. I will also advocate for a skate park in Alhambra, which currently does not have a skate park. I want to be connected with the skate and residential community and bring positive change to the kids of these areas.
  What the Skate Shop Needs & What You Get At this point I need funding of about $ 8,000 for inventory, leasing options, in-shop equipment, skateboard racks, display cases, cosmetic upgrades to the location, and shop brand apparel and items. This will also allow me to offer free workshops that I mentioned in the above paragraph and to purchase the items I am offering for donations. I will be opening this shop even if I do not get full funding. I will not get as much inventory and buffer zone, but rest a sure that the shop will open by August of 2015! All Perks offered will be given within the first year of operation depending on the item. Thank you for your patience.

</div></div>","As Peace Corps Volunteers in Panama, we lived alongside rural agricultural producers, working to better plan their farms and develop their businesses.  We saw some positive changes, but as our service came to an end, we asked ourselves and our local counterparts how we could truly make a positive impact in their communities. The answer resonated loud and clear:  access to retail markets.  So, rather than spin our wheels and hunt for small ins, we are opening our own marketplace in the capital, Panama City,  to showcase a truly inclusive, transparent supply chain--a place to connect small, rural producers with the consumers in the city that yearn to support them.El
Motete MarketplaceEl
Motete Marketplace is a retail store in Panama City aiming to bridge the gap
between rural and urban Panama.  With an emphasis on community, culture
and food, our's is a space to empower small producers to grow their businesses and strengthen agricultural communities. Through personal relationships with our producers, we use a grassroots supply chain to stock the highest quality produce, staple foods, specialty goods, body care and more.  El Motete Marketplace is our first step and financial
engine towards supporting a more inclusive, transparent local food scene in Panama.  To foster a model that truly benefits the campesino farmers with whom we worked in the Peace Corps, we will dedicate a percentage of our profits to programs and trainings to help our producers scale their businesses, and grow their market share.

Province of Veraguas implementing agribusiness trainings and teaching biology
and chemistry in the local high school. He also worked in Los Santos in support
of sustainable cattle ranching projects through the Smithsonian's Environmental
Leadership and Training Initiative. Before Panama, Will worked extensively in
agriculture and education at the Program in Ecological Agriculture and Society
(PEAS), The Watershed Education Network, and the Outward Bound School. Deeply
committed to creating an inclusive agricultural supply chain, he lives for
his passion: empowering farmers and producers to protect the biosphere,
preserve their rich traditional lifestyles, and make a buck doing it. Will
holds a degree from the University of Montana in Environmental Studies with a
concentration in Sustainable Food Systems and Agroecology. He resides in Panama
City, Panama.Megan Vose spent the last two
years working along side cacao farmers in the region of Bocas del Toro, Panama
where she supported disease prevention, farm management and agribusiness
assistance. She also led a fundraising project to build a traditional birthing
center, with a group of Midwives in her community. Before living in Panamá, among other things, Megan was as a produce buyer for Whole Foods Market where she spent nearly 8
years. She has extensive experience in Latin American and India in commodity
agriculture, value added products and supply chain creation. Megan works with California Farm Link as a Loan Analyst and Farmer
Advisor, and is finishing a Masters in International Environmental Policy with
a focus on Business, Sustainability and Development at the Middlebury
Insititute of International Studies. She is taking advantage of opportunities
at MIIS to refine El Motete’s model of social impact, but can’t wait to get
back to the Isthmus in May 2016.We need your help to transform our vision into a reality--to remodel our store and stock our shelves. On top of the financial support, we want to share our passion for empowering small producers with our friends, family, and the world! Indiegogo  is our chance to involve a greater network of people invested in refining our vision, and creating a truly positive social and economic impact for campesino farmers.What You Get

</div></div>","“In every adversity
there lies the seed of an equivalent or greater benefit.” –Napoleon Hill. Poetic justice perhaps?
Are you inspired by second chance at life stories or do you simply enjoy poetic messages? 
Awesome! You're in the
right spot.  Keep reading. Look for the link to hear your free, poetry audio entitled ""Poetic Justice -Black Life Matters-Perhaps.""
Six quick bullet
points explaining why you will gladly fund our campaign... I mean besides
the fact that March 30th is my 51st birthday!!!   Woot- woot!  Shameless plug huh? This is short, simple
and to the point. 
Two second chance stories are
responsible for the birth of WinSation.com.  I 'm the Founder and I will tell one story here
and gladly share the other story on demand with anyone who gives a sugar, honey, iced, tea.


“I made the decision that my last job
     layoff would indeed be my last job layoff."" Poetic justice perhaps. 


After a career
that spanned almost 20 years in employment staffing, I
found myself with a loss of income immediately before undergoing
a medical procedure, and simultaneously fighting for healthcare benefits,
family medical leave, short term disability and unemployment compensation due
to confusion about the benefits that I'd qualify for given the circumstances.
 

Have you ever been fed up with that false
     sense of security that comes with merely having a job?  I sure have. 

Walmart (the Walton
family) realized that the country didn't need just another supermarket, nor did
the country need just another Kmart competitor.  They inventively and
courageously stepped outside-of-the-box to offer a combo & convenience that
now serves you and me very well.


""Build your own dreams or someone will hire you to build theirs."" - Farrah Gray.""  I am a poetic, motivational
     speaker trapped in a staffing recruiter's body.  My creative, humanitarian side wants to do more than just staffing. The visionary in me has created a covenience that will serve you and me very well.                                                                                      

We realize that the
country certainly does not need just another employment staffing company or
just another motivational speaker.  That’s why we have boldly blended
nationwide, remote access; employment staffing and life-skills training
designed to help ex-offenders with gainful employment. The unique style
of poetic, motivation mixes encouragement, responsibility & accountability to inspire a mindset shift. 

Why should you and I care about helping
     ex-offenders and other members of the under-served population
     gain employment and life skills?

Would you rather the
almost 700,000 ex-offenders released each year from correctional facilities
nationwide have no income upon their release? How  do you think that their lack of basic needs might affect your family and you? I  had a lapse in judgement once that could
have landed my butt behind bars.  Don't judge me :-). If you've ever
been a participant in road rage, or bending the truth on a tax return, etc., then you could have had a very similar story.
My infraction included lying for profit. God’s grace and mercy is the only reason I didn't serve any time. My story is now used to inspire and encourage others in areas of transparency, accountability and profit by adversity. I care. So should you.  
""Help others achieve their dreams and you will achieve yours.""-Les Brown.
Employers are invited to contact me directly to learn how hiring ex offenders from WinSation.com is a win-win for everyone.


Listen to our brand of poetic justice, “Poetic Justice-Black
     Life Matters – Perhaps” audio (a message to the non-peaceful,
     Ferguson, MO protestors) at http://www.winsation.com/opportunity-knocks---your-free-audio-guidance.html to lend credibility to my ability to create and deliver powerful, thought-provoking and
     valuable messages to even the toughest audiences. Circulate the message
     throughout social media 3 times and fund the campaign to show your love and
     support.  

If you can't give money right now, help by spreading the word of the campaign and the audio message at the website.  Some of the best things in life are free. 

IN OUR PERKS - We give our service and time to you . All of us can always make more money.  None of us can ever make more time.

You can't handle the truth?
Warning: The audio may
be considered raw and quite controversial. If you have a truth allergy, you may not want to hear it.  I'm just saying.
A BIG THANK
YOU in advance for
allowing me to live out my purpose, which is to give, teach, write, speak,
inspire and encourage.  
Your funds are used
to:
Help me to realize my dream and focus on the writing and speaking, especially to members of the underserved population while my team focuses on employment
placement, as well as add key team members and pay current small business overhead.  We are not professionals in social media or technology.  We need all of the help that we can get! 
·  Maintain the website & business utilities, expenses, etc. for the next 6 months =$9,600 (1,600 monthly for 6 months)
·  Pay a Contract Recruiter/Account Manager for the next 6 months at $25 an hour = $24,000.
""Winners are not people who never failed but people who never quit.""- Les Brown.
The only risk that I can honestly see is:
If for some odd reason we miss our goal and the mission to help create safer communities while getting ex-offenders to work with accountability, mindset-shift guidance is delayed, we simply live to fight another day. Not at anytime does it occur to me that WinSation.com will not be a huge success.  ""A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new."" - Albert Einstein.
Additional campaigns, if needed, will launch with an objective to bring on additional key staff and resources:
·  Website Content Developer (the website needs
professional help :-).
· Training Program Manager
·  Contract a Business Analyst and/or Business Coach.
·  Writing Editor. 
·  Accountant.
·  Legal Representative
·  Executive Assistant 

·  Contract a Marketing Representative (Soical Media Expert)
·  Applicant Tracking System and/or Job Board purchase.
BONUS: I have listed the 12 things that make a man(woman) rich according to Napoleon Hill.
1. A positive mental attitude(observe that it
heads the list).

2. Sound physical health.
3. Harmony in human relations.
4. Freedom from fear.
5. The hope of future achievement.
6. The capacity for applied faith.
7. Willingness to share one's blessings with others.
8. To be engaged in a labor of love.
9. An open mind on all subjects toward all people.
10. Complete
self-discipline.
11. Wisdom
with which to understand people.
12. Financial security.

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Nicaragua is the poorest country in 
Central America and the second poorest country in the Western 
Hemi-sphere. Most of the people there lack basic necessities such as 
food, clean water, shelter, education, and medical care which attributes
 to a cycle of poverty. During our time there, we will be coming along 
side two organizations, Pontis, Inc and The Hope Project, to serve the 
people of Matagalpa.</p> The ways we will be serving are: <p>•
  Building a chicken coop for a local family. This project will change 
the lives of a family and eventually a community.  Each coop will hold 
200 baby chickens that will be raised   and then sold for a profit. The 
average yearly income for a Nicaraguan family is $600.   With a chicken 
coop business they will able to increase their income substantially and 
  within a matter of months be able to pull themselves out of poverty.  
 </p>
<p>• Feeding children who live in a community next to a 
landfill outside of Matagalpa. The Hope  Project started this feeding 
program with feeding 6 children 3 days a week. It has now   increased to
 feeding 128 children 5 days a week.  </p>
<p>• Washing the children’s feet and giving each of them a new pair of shoes. We will also pray over each child individually.  </p>
<p>* Street ministry in the city of Matagalpa. </p>
<p>• Working with families on small farm projects that will help change the economy in local villages. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What I need<br/>
</h3>
<p> We all have the ability to do exactly what Jesus has called us to 
do. To go and make disciples of all nations. At the same time, we will 
also care for their physical needs. I know you may not be able to go to 
Nicaragua yourself but I would like to ask that you pray and consider 
supporting my team and our endeavor. I'm excited about the 
opportunity and experience that is ahead. I hope you see the value in 
what we will accomplish.   </p>
<p> As you can imagine, a trip like this 
requires financial support from a number of people. I need to raise 
$1600. If you can support me in a financial way, I would be very 
grateful. If you would like to be part of this mission through your 
financial support, please do! If you would like to make a tax-deductible
 dontation you can make it to The Abbey Church online at

 button and state the amount in the “Other” section. Be sure to write

contributions are tax deductible. </p>
<p> Most importantly, I need your 
prayer support. Prayer is the fuel that will allow us to be successful 
as we follow God's leading in ministry in Nicaragua. Please pray 
specifically for the areas listed above and thank you for considering 
being apart of this with me.  </p>

<h3>Who is Alex von Salad and what is Cold Press ? </h3> <p>I started cooking at a very young age manning the pots and pans in my mother's kitchen preparing lunch after school.  On Week-ends I assisted my dad on the BBQ. Fridays I was a 12 year old trainee at the local italian wood fired pizzeria.  My passion was born. I wanted to cook.  My own Salad dressing line came out in the 90's and was made in Napa Valley.  I sold it for a few years in gourmet shops around the US, but learned quickly that this was a very complicated business.  I built, managed and cooked in restaurants from NYC to Park City, Jackson Hole, Aspen and the Hamptons for many years.  A few years ago I had the urge to move back to Europe to be closer to my parents, but didn't really have a reason or a project that would put me there.  My last chef endevavours taught me about sustainability and local ingredients and I got heavily involved.  A friend of mine turned me on to an outfit in NY called Juicepress and I learned about Cold Press Juicing and all its amazing benefits and all around goodness.  Juicepress went from 1 store to 21 in 3 years.  My passion always has been dressings, sauces, soups and anything else liquid in the kitchen, so juices were a great new area for me to master. Europe is my home and so I decided to move back to my roots and start something culinary that is new and virtually non-existing. Thus far only 2 Cold Press Juice bars exist in Berlin, Germany.  None in Austria.  Now with me being based in Austria we will be the 1st one and we plan on expanding quickly - with 3-5 stores still to open this year.  The Raw food and Cold Press Juice Movement has barely started here in the EU and the market is wide open.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Now, in our 5<sup>th</sup>

public, act as a commercial kitchen to prepare food for the truck,
and can be the official headquarters for our operations.  While it's
fun to hunt down the Gorilla Cheese Food Truck on social media, or to
come across it when we're operating curbside or at a festival, many
people wish they could simply go to a consistent location at any time
of the day to get one of our delicious cheesers. After all, what's a
Hamiltonian (or an out-of-town visitor) to do when he/she wants a griled cheese, and the truck is at a festival in Whitby? A convenient
take-out location is the ideal solution to make Gorilla Cheese bigger,
better, and far more efficient!

place to get high-quality fast food.</p>

</p><p><b>WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP:</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>We were on track in
terms of budget and time to open our new store, but ran into an issue
in January  that brought all progress to a halt. The location was
erroneously designated within the City Building Department for use as
a “Hair Salon,” despite running for years as a takeout
restaurant. We originally leased the building under the impression
that it was a turn-key operation, in which we could simply  upgrade
some of the equipment, make it pretty with a new decor, put up our
sign, and <i>voila!</i>, we'd be open for business. This turned out
to not be the case. Where we thought we were taking over an existing
restaurant, we now had to meet the codes required to open a brand new
one from scratch. New architectural drawings, new ventilation systems, grease traps, etc... we didn't anticipate the
cost or the time associated with these unexpected requirements.
Construction of the new Gorilla Cheese Headquarters was halted during
the time it took to acquire the Building Permit that was needed to
facilitate the necessary upgrades. During the standstill, our
start-up funds dwindled.  An unopened restaurant still has monthly
bills and expenses, like rent, insurances and utilities.  While we
tried to generate the extra revenue ourselves with the food truck,
this harsh winter made it an exercise in futility. We were SO close,
but these extras and the time it took to get back on track really
took us by surprise. Our new storefront now sits with a fresh paint
job, new floors, new tables, a kitchen stocked with state-of-the-art
equipment and so much more, but we're unable to open until all these upgrades are
completed.   
</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>HOW CAN WE HELP YOU?</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Your funding will help
us bring our new storefront up to city code and complete construction
to open in April. Beyond the restaurant, we will also be introducing
a fresh new logo, a new <a href=""https://gorillacheese.wordpress.com/2015/04/20/state-of-the-union-a-call-to-arms-for-the-cheese-nation/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a>, and providing some much-needed
repairs to Gord so we can enter the 2015 season with a bang. Not only
will you help make a bigger, better Gorilla Cheese, you will also be
investing in a better Hamilton! This year will see Gorilla Cheese
provide upwards of twenty new jobs and add greatly to the
revitalization of Ottawa Street. Also, with our efficient new kitchen
and ability to purchase in bulk, we can actually lower the prices of
our sandwiches!</p>

</p><p>But the best part is
the PERKS!  From sandwiches to t-shirts, to having your own private
Gorilla Cheese party, to your name being etched into our 'Wall of

but also acts as an investment for YOU to become part of the

to open in April. Beyond the restaurant, we will also be introducing
a fresh new logo, a new website, and providing some much-needed
repairs to Gord so we can enter the 2015 season with a bang. Not only
will you help make a bigger, better Gorilla Cheese, you will also be
investing in a better Hamilton! This year will see Gorilla Cheese
provide upwards of twenty new jobs and add greatly to the
revitalization of Ottawa Street. Also, with our efficient new kitchen
and ability to purchase in bulk, we can actually lower the prices of
our sandwiches!

But the best part is
the PERKS!  From sandwiches to t-shirts, to having your own private
Gorilla Cheese party, to your name being etched into our 'Wall of
Excellence', your donation will not only get us to the finish line,
but also acts as an investment for YOU to become part of the
Gorilla Cheese Elite!  You're basically pre-purchasing AWESOMENESS.We are passionate about being the best company we can be, one that is a source of pride for Hamilton. We want to give you the best comfort food of the highest quality at a fair price, and serve it proudly with outstanding customer service. We just need your help to make this dream become a reality!Please click here for some more details about our crowdfunding campaign!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

For the last decade, I've been building a solution to the environmental and social problems caused by our consumer culture. While it's fun to shop, the consequences of consumerism result in habitat destruction, pollution, and inhumane working conditions.

By combining organic products with a rotating blend of recycled, handmade, and fair trade goods, Environmart provides convenience, style, and variety. Everything from vintage dishware to organic baby clothes, recycled notebooks, and fairtrade jewelry.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1381032/files/20150413221823-image.jpg?1428988703"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our target customers are socially conscious consumers who already contribute to the multibillion-dollar sustainable marketplace, and yet have no one-stop eco-shop to patronize.

</div></div>","Hi, I'm Marita Mirzatuny and I live in Austin, Texas. For the last decade, I've been building a solution to the environmental and social problems caused by our consumer culture. While it's fun to shop, the consequences of consumerism result in habitat destruction, pollution, and inhumane working conditions. That said, our modern reliance on variety and convenience provided by big box stores like Target or Walmart is not going to go away. Environmart is a retail store that bridges the modern necessity of one-stop shopping with sustainability and ethics. Environmart is an alternative to the typical big box stores. Using economies of scale, technology, and a creative supply chain, Environmart offers customers everyday lifestyle goods - such as clothing, housewares, furniture, and office supply - that adhere to environmental and ethical standards. By combining organic products with a rotating blend of recycled, handmade, and fair trade goods, Environmart provides convenience, style, and variety. Everything from vintage dishware to organic baby clothes, recycled notebooks, and fairtrade jewelry.Our target customers are socially conscious consumers who already contribute to the multibillion-dollar sustainable marketplace, and yet have no one-stop eco-shop to patronize. Current options consist of expensive boutiques or hunting down products online. Environmart offers an alternative to the status quo, wherein customers can feel good about their purchases without having to sacrifice. And even for those who don't have these issues at the forefront of their minds, the hip and fashionable items offered at Environmart are appealing and desirable on their own.I am seeking $10,000 to support Environmart in its perfect new location. Any and all money raised will be used directly for rent and other overhead expenses such as inventory.BACKGROUNDMy BA in Environmental Studies and an entrepreneurial-focused MBA, combined with my work experience in retail and project management, have allowed me to develop the unique supply chain required to provide everyday products on demand while simultaneously vetting the sustainability requirements. Currently, I bootstrap this startup while I manage my 9-5 job as a project manager in environmental advocacy at a large non-profit, focusing on getting consumers to adopt clean energy technologies like wind, solar, and smart devices. I am fueled by my passion knowing that something must - and can - be done to solve complicated environmental problems. And I believe consumers can be that solution.With a donation, you are not just investing in a stylish retail store, but rather a logisitics and distribution model that is truly innovative and essential to scale these kind of products.THE TRAILER STORE After years of online selling, in 2010 I launched Environmart as a physical pop-up shop at HOPE Farmers Market in East Austin and at the Austin City Limits music festival. In 2012, I won an award from legendary local businessman and founder of GSD&M ad agency Roy Spence. That award allowed me to expand into a more permanent shop in a 140 square foot trailer. Those doors opened in 2013. THE PICNIC Since then, I've been here and there around town. But last December I moved to the best location in Austin at The Picnic food truck park on Barton Springs Road!!! This is the perfect place to prove the market for better products and create the momentum to scale to a warehouse. The Picnic has a robust weekend following of swimmers headed to Barton Springs pool and people eating at the amazing food trucks (the best ones in the city hands down). There is also ACL Fest, the Kite Festival, and Trail of Lights. This means tens of thousands of shoppers walking right by the shop, who will love Environmart for its charm, variety of stylish products, and mission. For now, the shop is open on weekends with plans to expand hours. Luckily, the Picnic is a permanent fixture and  won't give way to development as many food truck lots have.Being near the best food trucks in town is not only great for business but also inspiring as the majority, like Hey Cupcake and Kebabalicious, have all followed the trailer to brick-and-mortar path. I plan to do the same for retail. WHERE Y'ALL COME IN!Our economy has to evolve if we are to thrive and survive. environmart provides a model for doing that but must be a part of the community it serves. Help me get to the goal of a large warehouse store, by funding our first-step trailer shop on Barton Spring road. They say it's about location, location, location. And this is true for retail. Let's get together and invest in this innovative and creative shopping experience. Having your support would be a grassroots, community endorsement. Allowing Environmart to prove the market and product test, growing into a warehouse store where economies of scale and efficiencies can be realized and costs cut. FEATURED Environmart has been featured in multiple publications including the Austin American Statesman and Austin Woman magazine and our social media following is expanding on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Now is the time to leverage this momentum!                           VALUE & CONTRIBUTION TO THE WORLDEnvironmart's impact on the world goes way beyond an ROI and a single bottom line.

Ultimately, the goal of the Boston Maccabi Rugby Club is to be known as much for its service to the community as for the quality of its rugby play.  With your help, we can grow our impact both on and off the field.</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Boston Maccabi Rugby has grown to a community of over 60 former and current players, as well as countless friends and loved ones who share our mission of service through sport. </p>
<p>In the past few years, we have donated thousands of dollars to the community through events such as the annual Boston City Councilor Tito Jackson's Thanksgiving Turkey Giveaway and the Smart from the Start toy drive. We have leveraged the camaraderie of the game of rugby to bring volunteers out in droves to serve and deliver meals at Rosie's Place and Jewish Families and Children Services. And we've sorted and prepared hundreds of school supplies and clothing for children in need through Cradles to Crayons. </p>
<p>This is just the beginning of the impact that we know we can have. </p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The Slater Foundation has generously and graciously agreed to match gifts to our organization up to $5,000.</p>
<p>These funds will allow us to:</p> <ul> <li>Expand our community service impact through volunteer service events for our players and fans throughout the Greater Boston Area.</li> <li>Playing rugby can be an expensive endeavor. These funds will help ensure that money is never a prohibiting factor for players who wish to join our team and take the field with us. </li> <li>Funds will also be used to assist with field fees, insurance, and other Boston Maccabi Rugby expenses. </li>

</div></div>","About Boston Maccabi Rugby The Boston Maccabi Rugby Football Club is a 501 c (3) non profit comprised of athletes who come together to play competitive and successful rugby, while also maintaining an abiding commitment to the timeless Jewish values of tikkun olam and tzedakah – repairing the world and giving back. Ultimately, the goal of the Boston Maccabi Rugby Club is to be known as much for its service to the community as for the quality of its rugby play.  With your help, we can grow our impact both on and off the field.
The Impact
Boston Maccabi Rugby has grown to a community of over 60 former and current players, as well as countless friends and loved ones who share our mission of service through sport. 
In the past few years, we have donated thousands of dollars to the community through events such as the annual Boston City Councilor Tito Jackson's Thanksgiving Turkey Giveaway and the Smart from the Start toy drive. We have leveraged the camaraderie of the game of rugby to bring volunteers out in droves to serve and deliver meals at Rosie's Place and Jewish Families and Children Services. And we've sorted and prepared hundreds of school supplies and clothing for children in need through Cradles to Crayons. 
This is just the beginning of the impact that we know we can have. 
  What We Need & What You Get The Slater Foundation has generously and graciously agreed to match gifts to our organization up to $5,000.
These funds will allow us to:  Expand our community service impact through volunteer service events for our players and fans throughout the Greater Boston Area. Playing rugby can be an expensive endeavor. These funds will help ensure that money is never a prohibiting factor for players who wish to join our team and take the field with us.  Funds will also be used to assist with field fees, insurance, and other Boston Maccabi Rugby expenses.

<li>Developed by Steven James Peterson and the Agave Sun
     International team. Steven James Peterson is 41, a former Private Detective, Bail Bondsman, Bounty Hunter, and Educator with the Boy Scouts.

<li>When I say “Saving the world from bad tequila one

     has a ""Giving Pledge"" to help communities in the USA and Mexico. We are a Green
     and Sustainable company. </li>
<li>We are poised to enter all 50 states! But only with
     your help.</li>
<li>You are changing lives here, and for the better.
     Helping this campaign means you are helping people in two different
     countries all along the supply chain. Our goal is to become something that
     years later you know you personally had a hand in making it great. </li>

<ul>
<li>Transparent facts. Our funding will be immediately
     applied to state level licenses, fees, and associated costs. Our estimate
     to secure licenses for the entire USA will run at $250,000.00 alone. We
     can begin operations before that amount, but this would open the door to
     the entire country. Securing those licenses is vital to our long term
     viability. </li>
<li>Transparent facts. We need office space. And not just
     any office will do. This will be our headquarters for the entire nation.
     And you will open the doors with your contributions.  </li>
<li>Transparent facts. Everything built here has been a
     result of lean startup principles and a lot of dedicated team players.
     The collaboration of that team is what makes Agave Sun International

<li>For me the saying “Saving the world” and we can get
     there “one bottle at a time” is a central part of our mindset here at
     Agave Sun International. Hitting campaign goals here set us on a path of
     key acquisitions. And this includes hiring a team. From there we can begin
     impacting the world in ways that make it better. Once we hit positive cash
     flow Agave Sun is going to help build in our community to make it stronger,
     and make positive impacts to last generations into the future. But to get
     there I need you.  </li>

<ul>
<li>Currently our risk is Barrier to Entry<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">. It is our
     estimated cost that it will take $250,000.00 to secure all of our licenses
     in the United States. But, we have a mitigation plan where at $7,500.00 we
     can set our lawyer loose. At $11,000.00 we can acquire office space. At $21,000.00 our doors to the
     office can open. At $42,000.00 all of our internal information technology
     needs are met. At $72,000.00 funds are aggressively applied to state
     license acquisitions. At $100,000.00 we can actively participate in the
     national tradeshows. Our stretch goals would be to hit $250,000.00 as that
     opens up most of the doors that are currently closed. Beyond this, we
     would be able to look to make some immediate positions available as those
     funds would be used to fill key roles in this company.  </span>
</li>
<li>Our plan is simple. Key acquired licenses are assets as
     they are the only legal barrier to cash flow. After that we are able to
     begin sales to Wholesale Distributors, Buying Agents, and Procurement
     Officers. Revenues will be aggressively reinvested into the company to
     secure its positioning. Phased growth and acquisition plans allow us to
     grow quickly in response to our demands on a departmental basis. </li>

Agave Sun International, a division of Raven Rising
     LLC. A Colorado company. Formed on 12/25/2015. That is right, formed on
     Christmas Day 2015. 
Developed by Steven James Peterson and the Agave Sun
     International team. Steven James Peterson is 41, a former Private Detective, Bail Bondsman, Bounty Hunter, and Educator with the Boy Scouts. Born in North Dakota, raised in Fargo (Yeah, just like the movie and show, same place), and Ski Geek at Crested Butte Colorado. 

When I say “Saving the world from bad tequila one
     bottle at a time” I mean it. Our goal is to impact change. Making the
     world a better place through tequila is a thing. Agave Sun International
     has a ""Giving Pledge"" to help communities in the USA and Mexico. We are a Green
     and Sustainable company. 
We are poised to enter all 50 states! But only with
     your help.
You are changing lives here, and for the better.
     Helping this campaign means you are helping people in two different
     countries all along the supply chain. Our goal is to become something that
     years later you know you personally had a hand in making it great. 
As a contributor you are helping us build a long term
     company. And that means everything to us. Our gratitude would be through
     the roof! 
And here is a secret, we are going to pick a few of the
     $20.00 contributors and surprise them with a huge show of thanks! You may want to make sure your passport is current...

What We Need 

Transparent facts. Our funding will be immediately
     applied to state level licenses, fees, and associated costs. Our estimate
     to secure licenses for the entire USA will run at $250,000.00 alone. We
     can begin operations before that amount, but this would open the door to
     the entire country. Securing those licenses is vital to our long term
     viability. 
Transparent facts. We need office space. And not just
     any office will do. This will be our headquarters for the entire nation.
     And you will open the doors with your contributions.  
Transparent facts. Everything built here has been a
     result of lean startup principles and a lot of dedicated team players.
     The collaboration of that team is what makes Agave Sun International
     special. And as the founder, I have the utmost respect and debt of
     gratitude of the team players who helped get us here today. 

If we miss the mark?

Any funds received will be applied to our securing of
     state level licenses. No two states are alike, so this requires a lot of
     attention. Why? Because these state level licenses are the final keys we
     need to officially open the doors. We need a minimum of $7,500.00 to start
     the process 
Knowing we have to reach $250,000.00 alone to secure
     all 50 state licenses we are simply asking you to pull the string back and
     watch us fly. 

What You Get
We have a lot of options for you!$1 Good Karma. We recognize you work hard for your money. So you can help by giving a single dollar and gain some good karma. In exchange we will hold you in high esteem. This is less than a Latte at Starbucks!
$5 Goodwill. You are showing us some great Goodwill! In exchange we will send you a Thank You Letter, and share our Thanks for you on our social media. Your support here is the key that unlocks the doors and turns on the lights! You make our world go round. Share your phone number and we will call and Thank You also. Can you even buy a plate of good Wings for this? 
$10 Super Supporter.  Wow, we love you! To show our love we will feature your photo on our office wall! We want our clients to know exactly who helped us get to where we are. You are the foundation we are built on. You will be featured as a Super Supporter. All we need is your photo for us to print. You pick the photo, we will post it. Less than what taking a friend out for lunch.$20 Launch Party Invite. But be 21 at the time of the event to enter. Avoid the cover charge. Be on the Guest List! Meet the VIP Team! And when we hit our goals, a couple of you will be picked for a special surprise. If I were you, I'd check to make sure my passport was current!

The Impact

You are impacting lives here. Your contribution grows exponentially.
     Each one of you who take part are touching people’s lives in two countries. You literally can know you have eventually
     impacted thousands of people with your contribution here. 
For me the saying “Saving the world” and we can get
     there “one bottle at a time” is a central part of our mindset here at
     Agave Sun International. Hitting campaign goals here set us on a path of
     key acquisitions. And this includes hiring a team. From there we can begin
     impacting the world in ways that make it better. Once we hit positive cash
     flow Agave Sun is going to help build in our community to make it stronger,
     and make positive impacts to last generations into the future. But to get
     there I need you.  
Each stage has been checked, each required move on the chessboard is
     measured. The only hurdle we have left is the state level licenses.  
By participating in this campaign you are one of those hands
     up. Even if you only leverage a single dollar, you are moving us up and a
     little closer to getting over the hurdle. 
This has been developed to be a sustainable business. From local community service projects to larger scale ones
     later, our goal is to leave our world better than we found it.  

Risks & Challenges

Currently our risk is Barrier to Entry. It is our
     estimated cost that it will take $250,000.00 to secure all of our licenses
     in the United States. But, we have a mitigation plan where at $7,500.00 we
     can set our lawyer loose. At $11,000.00 we can acquire office space. At $21,000.00 our doors to the
     office can open. At $42,000.00 all of our internal information technology
     needs are met. At $72,000.00 funds are aggressively applied to state
     license acquisitions. At $100,000.00 we can actively participate in the
     national tradeshows. Our stretch goals would be to hit $250,000.00 as that
     opens up most of the doors that are currently closed. Beyond this, we
     would be able to look to make some immediate positions available as those
     funds would be used to fill key roles in this company.  

Our plan is simple. Key acquired licenses are assets as
     they are the only legal barrier to cash flow. After that we are able to
     begin sales to Wholesale Distributors, Buying Agents, and Procurement
     Officers. Revenues will be aggressively reinvested into the company to
     secure its positioning. Phased growth and acquisition plans allow us to
     grow quickly in response to our demands on a departmental basis.

</h3>Hello thanks for taking the time to check out our campaign.  My name is Mandy and in partnership with my husband Richard, and his brother Shannon, we have an ambitious plan to keep a great Australian country pub alive.  Welcome to the small country town of Bolgart in Western Australia, about 130km from Perth in wheatbelt country north of Toodyay.<br/><br/>
<p>The owners of the Bolgart Hotel are ready to retire and move on.  We want to purchase the Bolgart Hotel and create a modern business that is professionally operated,  generous to the local community, and a
great place to come for a meal.<span>  We will be a welcoming hotel that is an enjoyable place to bring your
family and a proud member of the Bolgart community.   Whether you are a local, day tripper from Perth or an interstate/overseas visitor you'll find that something special about us and the Bolgart Hotel.  An exciting part of our plan is to put Dick and Shannon's beer making skills to good use and produce craft beer using wheat locally grown by farmers in the region.</span><br/></p>
<p>The three of us currently run small businesses and can see the amazing potential of this idea.  Dick and Shannon are HD mechanics and have worked in the area since 2008 providing mechanical services to farmers.  We now have a long term presence in the town and would love to be the 
ones who bring the Bolgart Hotel back to life and see her prosper for the town.<br/></p>
<p>Our stumbling block right now are the stringent lending requirements of traditional financial institutions.  With your help we'll be able to raise the funds to purchase and restore the 100 year old Bolgart Hotel.  <br/></p>
<p>Our goals are to:

</p>
<ul>
<li>
cater for a wide range of hotel patrons from young adults through to families, seniors, visitors, tourists and special guests;<br/>
</li>
<li>be
a contributor to the Bolgart community;<br/>
</li>
<li>
produce
Bolgart’s first ever commercial craft beer using our local farmers' grains;<br/>
</li>
<li>
rejuvenate
the building by investing in repairs and improvements; and<br/>
</li>
<li>
celebrate
the Hotel’s centenary this year in style with a weekend party and entertainment. </li>
</ul>
<p>This is not the first time such an ambitious fundraising event has taken place, an excerpt from Rica Erickson's book The Victoria Plains, she describes how in 1915 the town raised over 200 pounds (an enormous sum for the day) through a number of humorous and burlesque events as part of a gala day of of sports and bazaars.  <br/> Come with us now on an equally ambitious task of raising funds to keep the town's hotel alive.</p>

<ul>
</ul>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></h3>
</div><div>We are aiming to raise $500,000 to be used in three key areas:
<ol>
<li>top up our deposit; <br/>
</li>
<li>restore the building; and<br/>
</li>
<li>implement our business plan actions. <br/>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Part of the money raised will be used to help us achieve the 50% deposit required for commercial loans with banks.  The cash will supplement the security that we are personally providing.  <br/></p>
<p>Secondly, we need to invest in restoring the building so that she can see out another 100 years.  The current state of the building requires
work to improve the street appeal and preserve an important
part of the Bolgart town site history.  We need to upgrade the electrical system and install air-conditioning, as well as undertake plumbing repairs throughout the building.  A play area that is safe and attractive for children
also needs to be created so that families can enjoy time at the Hotel. </p>
<p>The third area in which funds will be used will be an investment into the management of the Hotel so that actions from
marketing plan, expanding the product and service range, and relationship
building can be undertaken.  A grand centenary celebration is planned  which we hope will include a weekend street party, entertainment and an exhibition of the local history over the past 100 years.  We would like to collect oral and pictorial contributions from community members to share which will be collated and made available electronically.<br/></p>

To thank you for your your contribution we've created a series of enticing Perks.  We've got two opportunities for you to be held in the highest esteem and have a bar named in your honor.  Or you may prefer to have the dining room named after you. There is also the opportunity to be the Hotel's Centenarian, with a plaque to be unveiled during the centenary celebrations in recognition of your contribution.   Maybe you'd like that elusive gold card for hotel visits - we've got that for you for when ever you are in town.  For those of you overseas who may not get the chance to visit the Bolgart Hotel we can work something out, like sending you our craft beer to enjoy whilst you beam into the bar via Skype!<br/><br/>You also have the option of making a contribution without claiming a perk, and can remain anonymous if you want. <br/><br/>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact <br/>
</h3>Your contribution will help us to ensure a piece of Western Australia's 
history is not lost.   The Bolgart Hotel was one of only 6 State Hotels 
built in the early 1900s and still has the characteristic double brick

<p>Our crowd funding target is extremely ambitious, if we achieve this goal then we can have the hotel in a state ready to celebrate it's centenary.  If we don't reach the target and are not in a position to be able to purchase the hotel then all contributors will be given the option of receiving a refund or agreeing to add their contribution to a community fund to repair what we can with the money raised.   All the perks provided are contingent on us being able to purchase the hotel. <br/></p>

</div></div>","Hi there!
Hello thanks for taking the time to check out our campaign.  My name is Mandy and in partnership with my husband Richard, and his brother Shannon, we have an ambitious plan to keep a great Australian country pub alive.  Welcome to the small country town of Bolgart in Western Australia, about 130km from Perth in wheatbelt country north of Toodyay.
The owners of the Bolgart Hotel are ready to retire and move on.  We want to purchase the Bolgart Hotel and create a modern business that is professionally operated,  generous to the local community, and a
great place to come for a meal.  We will be a welcoming hotel that is an enjoyable place to bring your
family and a proud member of the Bolgart community.   Whether you are a local, day tripper from Perth or an interstate/overseas visitor you'll find that something special about us and the Bolgart Hotel.  An exciting part of our plan is to put Dick and Shannon's beer making skills to good use and produce craft beer using wheat locally grown by farmers in the region.
The three of us currently run small businesses and can see the amazing potential of this idea.  Dick and Shannon are HD mechanics and have worked in the area since 2008 providing mechanical services to farmers.  We now have a long term presence in the town and would love to be the 
ones who bring the Bolgart Hotel back to life and see her prosper for the town.
Our stumbling block right now are the stringent lending requirements of traditional financial institutions.  With your help we'll be able to raise the funds to purchase and restore the 100 year old Bolgart Hotel.  
Our goals are to:




cater for a wide range of hotel patrons from young adults through to families, seniors, visitors, tourists and special guests;

be
a contributor to the Bolgart community;


produce
Bolgart’s first ever commercial craft beer using our local farmers' grains;


rejuvenate
the building by investing in repairs and improvements; and


celebrate
the Hotel’s centenary this year in style with a weekend party and entertainment. 

This is not the first time such an ambitious fundraising event has taken place, an excerpt from Rica Erickson's book The Victoria Plains, she describes how in 1915 the town raised over 200 pounds (an enormous sum for the day) through a number of humorous and burlesque events as part of a gala day of of sports and bazaars.   Come with us now on an equally ambitious task of raising funds to keep the town's hotel alive.
Read more about the Bolgart and the hotel on our website www.reviveacountrypub.com



What We Need & What You Get
We are aiming to raise $500,000 to be used in three key areas:

top up our deposit; 

restore the building; and

implement our business plan actions. 


Part of the money raised will be used to help us achieve the 50% deposit required for commercial loans with banks.  The cash will supplement the security that we are personally providing.  
Secondly, we need to invest in restoring the building so that she can see out another 100 years.  The current state of the building requires
work to improve the street appeal and preserve an important
part of the Bolgart town site history.  We need to upgrade the electrical system and install air-conditioning, as well as undertake plumbing repairs throughout the building.  A play area that is safe and attractive for children
also needs to be created so that families can enjoy time at the Hotel. 
The third area in which funds will be used will be an investment into the management of the Hotel so that actions from
marketing plan, expanding the product and service range, and relationship
building can be undertaken.  A grand centenary celebration is planned  which we hope will include a weekend street party, entertainment and an exhibition of the local history over the past 100 years.  We would like to collect oral and pictorial contributions from community members to share which will be collated and made available electronically.

To thank you for your your contribution we've created a series of enticing Perks.  We've got two opportunities for you to be held in the highest esteem and have a bar named in your honor.  Or you may prefer to have the dining room named after you. There is also the opportunity to be the Hotel's Centenarian, with a plaque to be unveiled during the centenary celebrations in recognition of your contribution.   Maybe you'd like that elusive gold card for hotel visits - we've got that for you for when ever you are in town.  For those of you overseas who may not get the chance to visit the Bolgart Hotel we can work something out, like sending you our craft beer to enjoy whilst you beam into the bar via Skype!You also have the option of making a contribution without claiming a perk, and can remain anonymous if you want. 
    The Impact 
Your contribution will help us to ensure a piece of Western Australia's 
history is not lost.   The Bolgart Hotel was one of only 6 State Hotels 
built in the early 1900s and still has the characteristic double brick 
construction with the iconic Jarrah wood floors and staircase. 
The isolation of rural living and the impact this has on mental 
health and community connection is well documented.  By keeping the 
Bolgart Hotel alive we are providing a meeting place for socialising, 
whilst also being an active contributor to local sporting and community
groups through our relationship initiatives in our business plan. 

 Our aim is for the Bolgart Hotel to become recognised as a country

<p><b>Intro</b></p>
<p>We all need access to affordable and consistent power sources to live our lives. Policy makers worldwide have mandated to increase levels of renewable energy generation to minimise global environmental impact, however these “clean” energy sources are not controllable in the same way as traditional (i.e. fossil fuel) sources for delivering power.</p>
<p>Maintaining consistent electricity supply relies critically on a stable frequency in the electricity network. Traditional fossil fuels, nuclear and even hydro power are all synchronous generators which create inertia to help maintain this frequency, and are controllable providing frequency response and maintained stability.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463382636/energy-flow_ehuitc.png"" src="""" style=""width: 320px;height: 320px;""/></p>
<p>New generation from wind and solar is asynchronous and does not have the same inertia, making frequency response difficult. Due to its volatility there is a limit to the amount of this type of energy we can integrate to grids without causing significant instability. Injection of power throughout the grid from renewables can lead to localized voltage and frequency issues. Current grids cannot adequately compensate and are not able to distribute the power elsewhere in the network to be used where it is needed.</p>
<p>The consequences of too much instability are energy loss, added cost, and network failure. It is the issue of volatility the Faraday Exchanger solves for.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Our design - Concept</b></p>
<p>We’ve designed a hardware device that replaces transformers in existing electricity grids and enables the more volatile and distributed energy sources to generate and dispatch electricity without disrupting the operation of the grid in delivering electricity to the user - you.</p>
<p>We have proved the design concept, and are now seeking to develop our first full prototype for testing. If successful this technology can potentially be used throughout electricity grids worldwide.</p>
<p><b>The Benefits of the Faraday Exchanger</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Greater integration of renewable energy sources</li>
<li>Greater network efficiency and reduction of loss between points</li>
<li>Potential for peer to peer energy sharing</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<ol>
<li>Solution: Store and use renewable energy like conventional generation using batteries<br/>Flaw: Battery technology is still too expensive for the wider population and not efficient enough for large networks</li>

<h3>More about the Faraday Exchanger</h3>
<p>A Faraday Exchanger is intended to be one of many throughout an electricity network to manage and balance the volatility of e.g. solar and wind energy sources.  When distributed throughout a grid, the ‘Faraday Grid’ will act to provide the inertial response and primary frequency response to maintain stability.</p>
<p>The Faraday Exchanger directly replaces transformers in the existing electricity grid, changing the constraints of our existing grid. It utilizes all the existing poles and wires in our grid. It also removes the need for additional expensive equipment or systems, which makes the grid more fragile.</p>
<p>The implementation of our Faraday Exchanger will create a self-managing power grid. Deployment of Faraday Exchangers into our energy networks will turn our current under-performing grid into a more efficient and responsive ""Faraday Grid"".</p>

<h3><b>Our Campaign Goals</b></h3>
<p>The next stage of our project is simulation and prototyping. Taking the lessons learnt from our proof of concept prototypes, a dynamic model of our original design will be created in advanced simulation packages. This will allow us to test a number of applications and design versions through design optimization in order to make improvements in both response and efficiency much faster and safely than doing it physically.</p>
<p>Once the design has been completed, the components for our first prototype will be manufactured by local suppliers and assembled for testing and analysis in our lab. With this prototype we will be able to use the results to put together a comprehensive proposal to help us fund the full design and commercialization process.</p>
<p>This process will take us 4 months and cost $250,000. If we do not reach our funding goal, all funds raised will still go directly toward the simulation and prototyping. The remaining funds required will be invested by our team over time as we can afford, which may draw out our development process timeline.</p>

<p><b>François PARTHON de VON and Alban PETITEAUX <span style=""background-color: initial;"">are the Wood guys serving the Wine and Spirit guys.</span></b></p>
<p>While Francois PARTHON de VON walks the prestigious French national forests to select the best old oaks for the greatest vintages of wines and spirits, Alban PETITEAUX often gives lectures on enological oak.</p>
<br/><p></p>
<h3>Birth of ze idea</h3>
<p>Alban always ends his presentations with a tasting of several oak profiles in a wine or spirit. </p>
<p>Participants learn to discern :</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">the tannins, </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">the structure</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">the flavor </span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout the tasting, they discover <b>the roles of oak during the ageing</b>, and its contributions in terms of :</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">flavor,</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">intensity, </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">finish.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p> This is an original sensory experience, both very personal and participatory. Novice amateurs or confirmed tasters alike do enjoy this fun exercise, and some finally understand why they like a ""woody"" style over another.</p>
<p>Often at the end of these conferences, participants ask Alban how they can reproduce this great experience at home, with their friends or family.</p>
<br/><p></p>
</div><div>
<h3>That's why we created Ze Taste of Time tasting kit</h3>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464874191/logo-web_vvwlmw.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>

<p>ZE TASTE OF TIME is a pretty box containing:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">6 white 37.5cl glass bottles identified by codes, </span><br/>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
<p><b>The first bottle is empty. It will be the control “unoaked” bottle. </b></p>
<p>The following four bottles contain one oak stick and the sixth bottle is preloaded with two sticks.</p>
<p><b>Wooden sticks made of authentic ultrapremium barrelgrade oak</b></p>

<br/>
<p>Behind their apparent simplicity our wooden sticks are made of <b>AUTHENTIC ULTRAPREMIUM </b>slow-growth barrelgrade, <b>oak 150 to 250 years old,</b> harvested by us at the heart of the most prestigious French national forests, </p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464964216/PEFC_OENOWOOD_lyfdlr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>100% sustainably managed and P.E.F.C. certified.
<p>Split by hand in prime stavewood, air-stacked and left to season outdoor for at least 2 years, the oak is precision-toasted before being cut into sticks by our French craftsmen.</p>
<p><b>More than wood, these oak sticks are concentrated time! ...</b></p>
<p>By adding wine in bottles (unoaked or as little oaked as possible - seek advice from your favorite wine shop), and letting infuse a few days, the user truly experiences the TASTE OF TIME.</p>
<p>Each piece of toasted oak tells a different story, with main and secondary aromas, tannic or sweet impressions, etc.</p>
<p>With this tasting kit, the user discovers the tastes of oak, and learns in a fun and friendly way the different qualities wood brings to wines and spirits: color, tannins, aromas, structure...</p>
<p>Red, white, dry, sweet, each wine variety reacts differently. <b>The kit is reusable. </b>It is easy to <b>repeat the experience by buying an oak sticks refill box.</b></p>

<p>OENOWOOD INTERNATIONAL is a privately owned company founded in 2011 by François PARTHON VON and Alban PETITEAUX in <b>Cognac</b>, <b>the world capital of fine brandy</b>, high-end cooperage, and the leading exporting French region of spirits, in the heart of the European ""Spirit Valley"".</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The company's main objectives are to meet the expectations of stakeholders in the timber industry and the wine sector looking for commercial and technical expertise, strategic advice and solutions related to the use of wood in all its enological forms.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>FAQ</h3>
<div></div>
<p><b>Why do I have to fill the bottles myself ?</b></p>
<p>For two reasons : first, we let you choose the alcohol you prefer to try with the oak. Second, if we pre-fill the bottles with wine for example, it will slowly oxydize by the time you receive your kit and vinegar is not what we want to taste!</p>
<p><b>Which wine should I use ?</b></p>
<p>You can use any red, white, rosé wine (unoaked or as little oaked as possible - seek advice from your favorite wine shop ) , but it also works with beer or liquors such as Rhum for example. Pick the one you prefer or try it with each of them if you can't choose.</p>
<p><b>How to organize a tasting ?</b></p>
<p>You will find all the details or our<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFN4O5nU5Qwsw7f_aNxukNA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Youtube channel.</a></p>
<p><b>How many times can I use the sticks ?</b></p>
<p>It is better to use them only two times, because during the infusion, the alcool goes through the wood and takes the tannins and aromas. After two uses, the wood has nothing left to infuse.</p>
<p><b>How can I get more woodsticks ?</b></p>
<p>Ask your wine retailer for the refills. If he does not have some, send us your details and we will give you the nearest refill retailer's adress.</p>
<p><b>Is it possible to do it with big bottles ?</b></p>
<p>Yes, you will just have to double the dose of oak wood sticks.</p>
<p><b>I prefer one particular toast, is it possible to get a special refill ?</b></p>
<p>Yes, there are special boxes with one particular toast  and boxes with a blend of different toasts.</p>
<p><b>What is the perfect recipe ?</b></p>
<p>It is the one you will create with your kit, that you and your friends like and which matches your favorite dishes.</p>

Learning the tastes of grape varieties is relatively easy with advice from one’s favorite wine shop, but nothing existed until today to LEARN ABOUT THE WOOD WE ALL DRINK, and understand the alchemy between the barrel and the wine or spirit inside it!
We made it simple, educational and fun for you :
The barrel oak tasting kit ZE TASTE OF TIME is a simple and educational way to experience at home, with friends or alone, without stress, with interactive educational content and explanations from renowned oak experts (available online on our dedicated website).


Created by two enological wood experts







François PARTHON de VON and Alban PETITEAUX are the Wood guys serving the Wine and Spirit guys.
While Francois PARTHON de VON walks the prestigious French national forests to select the best old oaks for the greatest vintages of wines and spirits, Alban PETITEAUX often gives lectures on enological oak.

Birth of ze idea
Alban always ends his presentations with a tasting of several oak profiles in a wine or spirit. 
Participants learn to discern :



the tannins, 


the structure


the flavor 


Throughout the tasting, they discover the roles of oak during the ageing, and its contributions in terms of :



flavor,


intensity, 


finish.


 This is an original sensory experience, both very personal and participatory. Novice amateurs or confirmed tasters alike do enjoy this fun exercise, and some finally understand why they like a ""woody"" style over another.
Often at the end of these conferences, participants ask Alban how they can reproduce this great experience at home, with their friends or family.


That's why we created Ze Taste of Time tasting kit


Ready-to-fill and easy to use, rich in educational content and practical tips to organize and lead the tasting



ZE TASTE OF TIME is a pretty box containing:



6 white 37.5cl glass bottles identified by codes, 


6 closures also coded, 


1 anti-drip disc to simplify the wine service, 


1 pipette for those who want to do their final blend,


 and an access code for a lot of educational content online.


The first bottle is empty. It will be the control “unoaked” bottle. 
The following four bottles contain one oak stick and the sixth bottle is preloaded with two sticks.
Wooden sticks made of authentic ultrapremium barrelgrade oak



Behind their apparent simplicity our wooden sticks are made of AUTHENTIC ULTRAPREMIUM slow-growth barrelgrade, oak 150 to 250 years old, harvested by us at the heart of the most prestigious French national forests, 

100% sustainably managed and P.E.F.C. certified.
Split by hand in prime stavewood, air-stacked and left to season outdoor for at least 2 years, the oak is precision-toasted before being cut into sticks by our French craftsmen.
More than wood, these oak sticks are concentrated time! ...
By adding wine in bottles (unoaked or as little oaked as possible - seek advice from your favorite wine shop), and letting infuse a few days, the user truly experiences the TASTE OF TIME.
Each piece of toasted oak tells a different story, with main and secondary aromas, tannic or sweet impressions, etc.
With this tasting kit, the user discovers the tastes of oak, and learns in a fun and friendly way the different qualities wood brings to wines and spirits: color, tannins, aromas, structure...
Red, white, dry, sweet, each wine variety reacts differently. The kit is reusable. It is easy to repeat the experience by buying an oak sticks refill box.

 About Oenowood

FAQ

Why do I have to fill the bottles myself ?
For two reasons : first, we let you choose the alcohol you prefer to try with the oak. Second, if we pre-fill the bottles with wine for example, it will slowly oxydize by the time you receive your kit and vinegar is not what we want to taste!
Which wine should I use ?
You can use any red, white, rosé wine (unoaked or as little oaked as possible - seek advice from your favorite wine shop ) , but it also works with beer or liquors such as Rhum for example. Pick the one you prefer or try it with each of them if you can't choose.
How to organize a tasting ?
You will find all the details or our Youtube channel.
How many times can I use the sticks ?
It is better to use them only two times, because during the infusion, the alcool goes through the wood and takes the tannins and aromas. After two uses, the wood has nothing left to infuse.
How can I get more woodsticks ?
Ask your wine retailer for the refills. If he does not have some, send us your details and we will give you the nearest refill retailer's adress.
Is it possible to do it with big bottles ?
Yes, you will just have to double the dose of oak wood sticks.
I prefer one particular toast, is it possible to get a special refill ?
Yes, there are special boxes with one particular toast  and boxes with a blend of different toasts.
What is the perfect recipe ?
It is the one you will create with your kit, that you and your friends like and which matches your favorite dishes.

Taste of the Truth</b></p>
<p>Greetings fellow souls of the Universe,</p>
<p>The stars have aligned, such that we are able to bring to
you a taste of truth through the gift of food. We’ve scowered the galaxy, far
and wide, for nourishment that feeds the healthiest and most vibrant beings.
Mission successful.</p>
<p>Galactic Garbanzo is here to bring you a taste of vegan
delight you will never forget. Run by three close friends with a unique passion
for food, each with years of experience in the restaurant industry. Together we
will work harmoniously to deliver the absolute best vegan treats that Hartford has to offer. </p>
<p>After discovering our love for falafel from a favorite spot
nearby, our lives changed forever. Falafel is a universal food that
puts smiles on the faces of vegans and meat eaters alike. With a blend of
crispy falafel, fresh veggies, a spicy spread and a layer of creamy tahini to
top it all off, you will leave with a full belly and happy body.</p>
<p><b>The Team</b></p>
<p>Michael Myrbeck- The face you will get to know and love.
Mike is taught in the art of non-aggression from the voice of Truth itself. You
can be sure that he will lead you to the right choice when you meet him at the
register</p>
<p>Justin DiLuiso- A skilled food artist with experience in
cuisine from many different cultures. As a certified Reiki Master Practitioner,
Justin will heal your energetic fields with each delicious dish. His deep care
for Truth is foremost in all his actions.</p>
<p>Jacob Downey- Jake’s studies into the deep crevices of Truth
by exploring geometry in relation to the construct of this very cosmos. His
experience as a chef started at twelve years of age and has molded him into the
masterful culinary wizard that he is today.</p>
<p><b>Fundraising Goal-
$20,000</b></p>
<p>After months of research into food trucks, we thought that
this would be a fair amount of money we could use to get our business up and
running. Every penny will go to ensuring that we can start the business
successfully and smoothly. </p>
<p>Breakdown:</p>
<p><i>Food Trailer-</i>A mobile food trailer is not an
inexpensive piece of equipment. A used trailer, with all necessary equipment
and in good working order typically falls in the price range of $15,000. This
includes a trailer big enough to fit us, a good-sized grill, refrigerators, all
necessary food safety equipment, generator and anything else a small kitchen
might need.</p>
<p><i>Start-up Inventory- </i>To
start our first day on the food truck, we will need money to buy our first
groceries and all other supplies we will need to work inside the food truck. A
good estimation for this would be somewhere around $1500. </p>
<p><i>Licenses- </i>In order
to start a small business, such as a food truck, there is a number of different
licenses and permits that need to be acquired before opening day. Each individual
license/permit has their own individual fee. An estimation to cover such fees
will likely run somewhere around $1500.</p>
<p><i>Branding- </i>A
business needs a brand in order to be marketed to people. This includes graphic
design work for the menu and logo, t-shirts and hats for uniforms, take-away
menus for people to have, stickers and a social media presence. The price of
all these things would be somewhere around $2000 in total. </p>
<p><i>Wiggle Room- </i>Food
trucks often need other money set away in order to leave safety for any blips
in the road. This money will be funded through our own savings in order to show
we are fully committed to investing and believing in our idea, as much as you
are by making any size contribution. For this, we will raise $5,000 independently.</p>

<p>Work abandonment is a common concern with
online outsourcing.  If it happens, the
app would cycle the task to the next professional on queue to see it done.  This happens automatically after a

consecutive days, or earlier if the Provider formally issued a job cessation
notice.  In either case, the Provider in
question may not receive the agreed payment for the task and/or be penalized

<p>So back Request and Forget today and turn your dreams into reality!</p><br/><br/></div>","Request and Forget is a tasks fulfillment app and website
that seeks to bring people together, to get their projects done at the earliest time
possible at the highest quality. 
It aims to revolutionize the service industry allowing Requester (individuals, corporations and
non-profit organizations) a platform to request help to complete their
projects and daily tasks.
Requesters and Providers will be able to help one another
collaborate on a single task or entire projects no
matter where they are in the world, and can track each project’s progress through the website
or via the mobile app. Unlike other outsourcing services in the market which
cater only to digital outsourcing services, Request and Forget also opens the door
to new local opportunities, such as maid and nanny services, gardening, home
renovation, etc. using GPS support. 
Either party can offer and/or accept tasks for an agreed
price or complete tasks for free and help
people, charities and new projects.  
All
financial aspects and auditing of the tasks will be handle seamlessly by the
Request and Forget system.
Traveling and doing business abroadVisiting or settling
in a new country is not easy, but with Request and Forget, you would be able to
Request an interpreter or a guide as you arrive at the airport, or even before
you arrive by requesting the task at your destination, and Providers will respond
to you.
House choresI need help with house
chores, how can I find someone quickly?  With my Request & Forget app,
I could simply add a Request for one and a suitable Provider in my area will
come to me.
Non-Profit Organization and ProjectsI need help with my
project but can’t afford to pay for it, I could use
Request and Forget app to get help for free. The Providers who like my
project can join me voluntarily, the experience itself can be rewarding, and
they also gain other things from Request and Forget rewarding system.

IMPORTANT NOTE:To
make sure that you benefit fully from these perks, you will have two years to
take advantage of them.  That way you can wait to be established before
availing yourself of this portion of the perk and save even more money with the
transaction fees and increase your revenue by getting ahead of the pack when it
matters.The outsourcing will be contracted
to Provider Backers in priority, than active Providers (if needed). 
If we don’t have anyone to fulfill your request at the beginning, our team will
do it for you.These amounts can be use for online services such as: data entry, proofreading, ghost writing, website design, graphic and artwork, online marketing campaigns, social media management, programming, app design and similar services.  It can also be use for telemarketing, accounting and many other such services.The outsourcing will be provided by our house team of dedicated employees to insure work flow. For assistance, we will use Provider Backers in priority, than active Providers (if needed).The employees will be supervised at our offices and you will have access to them directly.  The Request and Forget system of team  work will be used.  Unless you want a focal point single employee. We’ll discuss it after the campaign is completedWe are supplying all the equipment; computers, cameras, software and monthly subscription to the Internet and hundreds of dollars in SEO, graphic and office software.You will get your reward as soon as we confirm the pledge payment.The employees and offices are located in Manila. Philippines.  But, you will be able to contact both the staff in the Philippines and in the United States at anytime via Skype, email or conventional telephone.





 

 
				

Automatic
mode

Just submit a task in automatic mode and forget
about it until it is completed.  A Monitor
will insure that the task is distributed to the right Provider.  When completed, the Monitor will review the
task, make sure it is done according to your guidelines and send it to you.  If it is to your liking, no further actions
are necessary.
				


 


 
				

Manual
mode

The manual mode doesn’t mean that you will have
to do everything by yourself.  All you
need to do in that mode is to list the tasks you want done and let the
system find the right Providers for you. 
All you will need to do is select the Provider from a list of best candidates
and confirm that the work is done to your liking ones completed.
				


 

 
				

Gamification
If generosity is not enough to entice
people to complete tasks for free, we have wrote a gamification program using
achievements, badges and rewards.  The
rewards will help Providers to increase their levels, which in term will allow
them to be selected first for paid tasks. 
Security mode are coded to prevent “farming” and cheating.



 

 
				

Task
Monitoring
In the automatic mode the monitoring will
be done by Providers that will earn a percentage of each paid tasks or they
will be able to do it for free and earn credits, badges and help the causes they
like.



 

 
				

Task
Cycling
Work abandonment is a common concern with
online outsourcing.  If it happens, the
app would cycle the task to the next professional on queue to see it done.  This happens automatically after a
lull-activity period (defined as zero progress at all for your project) for two
consecutive days, or earlier if the Provider formally issued a job cessation
notice.  In either case, the Provider in
question may not receive the agreed payment for the task and/or be penalized
with a demerit in the reputation system.















Who
  are the Requesters?


Requesters generally fall into three
  categories:
1) 
  Individuals that are looking
  for local tasks, 
2) 
  Internet entrepreneurs that
  want instant outsourcing at an affordable price, and 
3) 
  Corporations that need a
  rapid influx of outsourcing staff for projects and virtual assistant with
  management.




Who
  are the Providers?


Providers are highly competent service
  professionals who use Request and Forget as their platform to reach out to
  potential clients that can benefit from their chosen field of expertise.  These can be local Providers, such as a
  gardeners, maids, babysitters in your area, or international virtual Providers,
  such as programmers, virtual assistance, website designs etc…  They can also be people that want to
  connect and help others succeed their projects, volunteer to help
  organizations and individuals in need.




Why
  become a Provider?


Providers can make money by helping
  Requesters complete their tasks for a set amount.  It’s also a great avenue to display one’s
  portfolio, particularly if a Provider is in the field of design or graphic
  arts.  If a Provider wishes, he can
  also opt to offer his services for free[MNM1] .




How
  to profit as a Provider?


There are several ways to make extra
  income as a Provider:
1. 
  Make yourself available to
  accept local tasks
2. 
  Accept the tasks that the
  system will attribute to you
3. 
  Look on the Board for request
  that have no categories




How
  is the selection of Providers accomplished?


Anyone can become a Provider.  However, to increase in level and to ensure
  that you are consistently prioritized for requested tasks, we have established
  a system of achievements, rewards, badges and auditing in terms of monitoring
  of the quality of services rendered. 
  The higher your Provider Level, the higher you will be placed in the job
  priority queue and the more people will trust you.




Can
  we negotiate the price?


Yes you can, particularly if you’re a
  local Provider.  For outsourced Providers,
  the prices are based on the national average of each country to give you a
  baseline when selecting your Provider.  You can find more details in the videos
  (title)




Can
  I request a task even if there are no Service Providers in that category?


Yes, there will be a separate wall that
  will be populated by tasks that have no Providers or Categories at the moment
  of the request.




How
  are the jobs distributed?


The priority will be given by the CAR
  rating of the Provider, which utilizes an algorithm that analyzes
  achievements, badges, special Backers rewards and the quality of the service
  provided.




What
  if I want to wait for certain service Providers to do my work?


The system is designed to give both the
  Requesters and the Providers the freedom to accept and refuse to work with one
  another.  You can add people to your
  favorite list or blocked list.  The
  algorithm is design to match up Requesters and Providers that have worked
  together in the past.  That will help
  increase job efficiency as people start to know each other.




How
  can I increase my limit of work and level?


The higher your level, the more jobs you
  will get.  Do free work when you have time, and increase your achievements
  and earn badges.  It may sound like a
  game, because it is.  Gamification is
  the way of the future and Request and Forget is taking this route as
  well.  After the launch, we will have a
  complete video series on how to increase your revenues using R&F.




What
  are the payment methods in R&F?


Credit card, PayPal and Wire transfer




I’m
  having an issue with a request I have made, what should I do?


First, message the Provider and see if he
  can fix it.  If you still have
  problems, you can open a ticket by pressing the Resolution button.  Your case will be analyzed and a solution
  will be mediated on a case by case basis.

Once you have pressed the Complete
  button, the Requester will receive the notification.  If you have a high-enough level, the
  payment will be made immediately.

</div><p></p><h3>Who we are</h3><div>What do a retired soldier, a fashion designer and a very creative idea man have in common?  Well, beer naturally!  Sacramento has the reputation for being the farm to table capital of the United States, and we want to carry on that idea with awesome local, West Coast craft beers.  Act global, drink local!<p></p>
<p>We are opening a taproom in Midtown Sacramento featuring 16 carefully selected craft beers from the West Coast, including at least two EXCLUSIVE brews that can only be found in our bar.  One of those beers boasts a two time first place prize from the California State Fair.  Not bad huh?</p>
<p>Beyond the taproom, we will have upwards of 300 different craft beers for sale.  We find it ridiculous that with so many amazing craft beers out there, that when we go to other liquor stores they always have the same selection.  The people deserve better!</p>
<p>I have personally served my country and now want to settle down and start my own business.  It's something I am passionate about, and have always wanted to do.  My father ran a very successful bar while I was growing up and now I'd like to take what I learned from him and create a taproom where people can come in, relax, and sample the best the West Coast has to offer, without the snobbery.  As a Veteran owned and operated business, we hope to have events that raise money and awareness to help out other vets in need.  </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So as we said before, things don't come cheap.  Red tape is expensive and that's where we need your help.  We are in the midst of filling out paperwork all over the place, creating a website, and beginning to acquire equipment.  The funds that you contribute will go directly to these things.  If we exceed our target goal, then we will use those funds to really make the place nice!  We are very hands-on people, and we plan on doing the bulk of the work ourselves.  We like to consider ourselves creative and so we plan on creating a really comfortable, relaxing and friendly atmosphere for you and your friends to hang out at and socialize over some very tasty beers.</p>
<p>But you don't want to hear about what we need.  What's in it for you???</p>
<p>We have come up with some fun and interesting perks that we feel you will be into. </p>
<p>The first few involve shout outs.  You are important to us, no matter how small the contribution.  We want you to know that, and we want the world to know it as well.  We will express our gratitude by mentioning you on our website, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. </p>
<p>Next we have our Brü Co limited edition Founder's pint glass.  They will feature the Brü Co logo and the word ""Founder"" on them.</p>

<p>Next up, for those who like to party, and be a part of something exclusive, we will host a pre-opening party where you can come with a friend and enjoy live music, food, door prizes and of course delicious craft beer.  Must be 21 or over to attend, because we don't want to start our adventure off by being arrested…</p>
<p>You really want to be a boss?  Ok, then we will offer five bar stools up to be engraved with your name.  Whenever you come see us, that stool is your right.  Someone sitting in it?  No problem, we'll ask them to relocate.  Must be 21 or over for this bad-ass opportunity.</p>

<p>Ok, ok.  We've talked about stuff, but what is this really about?  BEER!  How about beer for life?  Yes!  Our level 1 beer for life program offers you one free beer per month FOR LIFE!  We'll have your name programmed into our computer.  You show up with your ID and ask the bartender for a beer, and it's yours!  Must be 21 or over - obviously - and the free beer is non transferrable.  For on-site consumption only, and they are not bankable.  If you miss a month, that's a bummer, but no worries, there will always be the next month.  Tips to our bartenders are not included with the free beer.  Level 2 is the same, but you get one beer per week.</p>
<p>Level Boss is for the serious beer drinker.  One free beer per day, FOR LIFE!  Same conditions apply as with levels 1 &amp; 2, except you can come in EVERY SINGLE DAY we are open and have a different craft beer.  Not that you have to have a different one.  If you're a creature of habit and want the same thing every day forever, well then you are absolutely welcome to.  </p>
<p>Lastly, we are offering up the chance for you to have a private party in our taproom for you and 50 of your closest friends.  We will provide the music, food, and beer of course; you provide the guest list.  All party goers must be 21 or over.  We will coordinate the details with you should you be one of the very generous and lucky individuals to get this perk.</p>
<p>We hope that these perks make you nod your head, say hell yeah, and maybe even let a loud 'Murica escape your lips.  If a bald eagle happens to fly real close to you, go ahead and give that bad boy a patriotic high five!  </p>
<p>In all seriousness, we wholeheartedly are grateful to all of you, and we can't wait to share our dream with you and keep you updated on our progress.  If you can't donate, you can always help us out by getting the word out there and sharing this campaign with your friends.  </p>
<p>If you're not from around here, but like the idea, please feel free to help us out as well.  We can always take a picture of your brick or barstool and send it to you.  If you are in the area, come on down, say hi, and have a beer with us. </p>

We started the juice company after noticing many shortcomings to the current methods of production and distribution in our region and abroad. Surrounded by farmland we found it frustrating that our access to affordable produce grown sustainably and chemical free was little to none. Trying to convince farmers to change practices is no easy task. We decided we needed to provide an economic incentive to encourage conversion to sustainable practices.  Rather than wait for one to appear we chose to create it ourselves. This is where our raw organic cold-pressed juice was created.</p><p>Cold pressed juice is one of the best nutrient delivery systems devised by man as well as adding a level of convenience and accessibility to produce and fruit, in turn making it more consumable and marketable. This presented itself to us as an amazing opportunity to develop our own farming further, while also providing us with the needed resources and outlets to support other local farmers, in particular veterans.</p><p>One key aspect of our juice company and its farm, The Mountain Family Farm, is that we will use our proceeds after operation to further two very necessary agriculture projects.</p><p>Project One will be to cultivate our network of local veterans and organizations and create a multi-purpose veteran outreach program primarily focusing on training veterans in sustainable chemical free farming. This will range from small weekend workshops in gardening and farming, to fully integrated job training and placement. Ultimately the goal of the company is to train local vets in our method of farming, assist them in acquiring land to farm and providing them with purchasing agreements through the juice company. In doing this we believe it will spur the next generation of farming in our region. Currently there are over 300 million people in our country today and only 150,000 of the farmers who feed them are under the age of 35. The average age of the US farmer is nearly 60 years old. With population increasing at it's current rate we are going to need some fresh blood in there soon or things will start to look dicey here in a few years. As our program develops we hope to interact with local schools to develop on site 4 season greenhouses that the children can work out of and learn the basics of gardening and food production as well as provide them with a reliable affordable source of healthy food. </p><p>Project Two is our season extension research. We have been researching and developing a wide variety practices and implementations to allow local producers to extend their growing season well into the harsher portions of our seasons. Our designs are crafted to not only be as cheap as possible to construct but also to allow for maximum production out of a relatively small space. We have combined the theories of passive an active solar heating with raised bed, square foot, and straw mulch methods. We will also be developing an array of composting methods to sustainably feed our soil and plants. These will include local community composting, composting with local businesses, vermiculture, and both hot and cold methods of composting. We believe this system of growing will allow for a longer season of production with higher yields for less cost. We believe this will invariably lead to cheaper prices to the consumer and well as a strengthened industry that can meet the needs of consumers year round.  </p><p>Why Local?</p><p>Most food travels several thousand miles before it reaches your plate. This not only leaves consumers vulnerable to price inflation due to other economic factors such as the price of oil, but it also places an undo amount of stress on our ecosystems to produce and distribute food in this manner. By localizing food supplies(250 miles) you reduce the overall impact we have as a society on the rest of the world.</p><p>Why Chemical Free?</p><p>While some proponents of big agri-business will argue that chemical pesticide, herbicide, and fertilizer use is safe, we at Appalachian Juice Co. have developed the opinion that they are harmful to not only our bodies, but also the environment, from which we so greatly rely on to grow our food. We also feel that by utilizing some old and new age techniques of chemical free, sustainable farming  we can grow a better product for less. </p><p>Why Vets?</p><p>I became a veteran because an unnerving sense of duty that was passed on to me from several generations of soldiers before me bearing my last name. This trait is one of the most common among the veteran community. Selfless service, duty, and honor and just a few of the ethos a soldier swears to embody. Many vets returning home from war are bearing a variety of injuries, some more visible than others. These challenges can become overwhelming when coupled with economic factors like a lack of employment, but more so a lack of fulfilling employment.

We started the juice company after noticing many shortcomings to the current methods of production and distribution in our region and abroad. Surrounded by farmland we found it frustrating that our access to affordable produce grown sustainably and chemical free was little to none. Trying to convince farmers to change practices is no easy task. We decided we needed to provide an economic incentive to encourage conversion to sustainable practices.  Rather than wait for one to appear we chose to create it ourselves. This is where our raw organic cold-pressed juice was created.Cold pressed juice is one of the best nutrient delivery systems devised by man as well as adding a level of convenience and accessibility to produce and fruit, in turn making it more consumable and marketable. This presented itself to us as an amazing opportunity to develop our own farming further, while also providing us with the needed resources and outlets to support other local farmers, in particular veterans.One key aspect of our juice company and its farm, The Mountain Family Farm, is that we will use our proceeds after operation to further two very necessary agriculture projects.Project One will be to cultivate our network of local veterans and organizations and create a multi-purpose veteran outreach program primarily focusing on training veterans in sustainable chemical free farming. This will range from small weekend workshops in gardening and farming, to fully integrated job training and placement. Ultimately the goal of the company is to train local vets in our method of farming, assist them in acquiring land to farm and providing them with purchasing agreements through the juice company. In doing this we believe it will spur the next generation of farming in our region. Currently there are over 300 million people in our country today and only 150,000 of the farmers who feed them are under the age of 35. The average age of the US farmer is nearly 60 years old. With population increasing at it's current rate we are going to need some fresh blood in there soon or things will start to look dicey here in a few years. As our program develops we hope to interact with local schools to develop on site 4 season greenhouses that the children can work out of and learn the basics of gardening and food production as well as provide them with a reliable affordable source of healthy food. Project Two is our season extension research. We have been researching and developing a wide variety practices and implementations to allow local producers to extend their growing season well into the harsher portions of our seasons. Our designs are crafted to not only be as cheap as possible to construct but also to allow for maximum production out of a relatively small space. We have combined the theories of passive an active solar heating with raised bed, square foot, and straw mulch methods. We will also be developing an array of composting methods to sustainably feed our soil and plants. These will include local community composting, composting with local businesses, vermiculture, and both hot and cold methods of composting. We believe this system of growing will allow for a longer season of production with higher yields for less cost. We believe this will invariably lead to cheaper prices to the consumer and well as a strengthened industry that can meet the needs of consumers year round.  Why Local?Most food travels several thousand miles before it reaches your plate. This not only leaves consumers vulnerable to price inflation due to other economic factors such as the price of oil, but it also places an undo amount of stress on our ecosystems to produce and distribute food in this manner. By localizing food supplies(250 miles) you reduce the overall impact we have as a society on the rest of the world.Why Chemical Free?While some proponents of big agri-business will argue that chemical pesticide, herbicide, and fertilizer use is safe, we at Appalachian Juice Co. have developed the opinion that they are harmful to not only our bodies, but also the environment, from which we so greatly rely on to grow our food. We also feel that by utilizing some old and new age techniques of chemical free, sustainable farming  we can grow a better product for less. Why Vets?I became a veteran because an unnerving sense of duty that was passed on to me from several generations of soldiers before me bearing my last name. This trait is one of the most common among the veteran community. Selfless service, duty, and honor and just a few of the ethos a soldier swears to embody. Many vets returning home from war are bearing a variety of injuries, some more visible than others. These challenges can become overwhelming when coupled with economic factors like a lack of employment, but more so a lack of fulfilling employment. A secure food supply being the need it is to a community offers the returning veteran an amazing opportunity to continue to serve their community even after their official service has ended. All of these factors make developing this subset of the community into our next generation of farmers the most viable option we have while also maximizing the positive effect we hope to have on our community.By developing our wholesale expansion in conjunction with our farm we can have an immediate impact on our communities food supply, workforce, and overall well being. For this crowd-funding project we have allotted money for both our wholesale expansion as well as our farm. Budget: Wholesale Licensing-                          $15,000.00Four Row Seeder-                                $4,000.00 Three Point Tiller-                                 $2,000.00Raised Bed Disc Hiller-                            $500.00Spreaders(seed/manure)-                     $1,500.00Compost House Lumber-                      $1,000.00Seed-                                                     $5,000.00Greenhouse-                                          $6,000.00Irrigation                                                 $2,000.00Other                                                      $3,000.00Total                                                      $40,000.00 This encompasses only our bare necessities.

My name is Shaundra Stallworth, and I am a small business owner with a background in Tax preparation and planning, and public speaking. For as long as I could remember, I have had a passion for encouraging women who are in business or even have a thought of wanting to start a business, be the very best that they could possibly be. It is with that passion and desire to see other women succeed in business, that I am founding and currently in the process of forming a 501(c)3 organization named Woman of Worth Business Empowerment, Inc.<br/></p>
<p>Several months ago, out of pure frustration with the direction of my own business and in what I considered was a lack of growth, It was divinely inspired that I plan a conference to help other women who may be struggling in their own businesses. Nervous and unsure of my capabilities of embarking on such a big event, I know that this is something that I MUST do and it is needed. It inspires and motivates me to see other women succeed in their businesses, and this event  will be the very platform to help women go from struggling in their business to becoming successful in their business.</p> <ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We need your help!! right now, this conference is being privately funded (out of my own pocket), But we need your assistance. I am requesting $25000 to get this conference going and every single donation will be used specifically for that purpose.  Hopefully, there will be money coming in from ticket sales, but every event planner knows that there are expenses that need to be paid prior to the event, so the money will be used for the venue, catering, the entertainment, advertising and marketing of the conference and other conference expenses as they occur.</p>
<p>If I'm not able to reach my entire goal, I will continue to plan the conference because I believe that there is a purpose higher than myself and any contribution will definitely help relieve the stress and fear of not having enough money.<br/></p>

<p>When planning an event like this, there will always be some challenges along the way, even on the day of the event. The challenges that I face will be overcome by a plan B.

The largest event I have ever planned was a family reunion, and the one thing I have learned while planning that event, was to have a team of people working with you.

Everyone told us that they would definitely use such an application, considering that it will be free.Why London?
We have decided that London would make an excellent starting point of introducing the application to the market – around 90% Londoners under the age of 30 regularly use smartphones and over half have used applications for the purpose of making purchases in recent years. 
What do we hope from Indiegogo?
Our goal is set, but there is still work to be done. Currently we have a working prototype of our application. With your contributions we are hoping to turn it from this:To something like this: We will make sure that it is as convenient and user-friendly as possible and possibly add some additional helpful features. In addition after development has finished we will run promotional campaigns and give it out for free to all shoppers in order to make sure that buyers and sellers will find each other. Help us pave the road to a more enjoyable, hassle-free and money-saving way to shop.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi everybody, my name is Denis Sobnakov. I'm from Russia... actually the middle of Siberia... well the region around <b>Lake Baikal</b> to be exact, the oldest and the deepest freshwater lake in the world (it contains 20% of the world’s fresh water). I've been working with tourists from around the world as a tour guide for almost 10 years now. I show people the famous Trans-Siberian railway and the Trans-Mongolian route, Eastern Russia, China and of course my home region near Lake Baikal. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In 2011 my wife and I opened a small indie hostel in the city of Ulan-Ude (centre of Russian Buddhism, 150 km from Lake Baikal). We called it <b>Ulan Ude Travelers House </b>and it’s aimed at adventurous travellers, backpackers who travel and explore and those who inspire others – and we have fun there, too. We've had great time with our guests (mostly English-speaking) these four seasons – we’ve  accommodated about 4000 travellers during this time. A high feedback rate on all booking sites (93%) indicates we’re doing something right.</p>

<h3>Now...</h3>
<p></p>
<p>...we have an idea to open <b>another great indie hostel right on the shore of Lake Baikal</b>. The great vibe and fun will be even better with the magic of the lake added into the mix. Tourists will have an amazing time exploring local area, taking hot springs and boat trips on the lake, hiking in the local forests and walking on the ice of the lake in winter time.</p>

We've chosen a small fishing village called Turka located on the eastern shore of Lake Baikal. It is only 160km from Ulan-Ude  where all Trans-Siberian trains stop and easily accessible by public transport (two hours drive).

It is half way to famous the Barguzin Valley and Lake Baikal’s best bays, so people can go either direction. It is a tranquil and non-touristy place even in summer. You can experience real local life there.





What?

The main feature of the hostel is that we plan to build it out of a real used passenger train carriage.

(the picture to the right is actually taken from the internet)

Why not give it a new lease of life rather than just let it decay. It is recycling, reusing, giving a second life to something useful -  it's a green idea. And it would look just great.
The hostel will be environmentally friendly using green materials and heated in an efficient way. The train carriage will be fully refurbished inside to make it more comfortable.



Interior reconstruction 



Here is a 3D model showing how the inside will look.



The hostel will be able to accommodate up to 20 people. 8- and 12-bed dormitories will be created. 
Pricelist 


$10 per person per night for 12 bed dorm
$12,5 per person per night for 8 bed dorm

The hostel will have

</div>This is a call to Etsy Independent Artisans, Suppliers, and Vintage Sellers to look upon the dramatic changes of Etsy's policies over the last year as an incredible opportunity.<br/><br/>Etsy is/has been made up of independent Artisans, Suppliers, and Vintage Sellers which have made it the beautiful market place that it is. Not only are we Artisans, but business owners as well.<br/><br/>It has been largely rumoured over the last several days that Etsy is going public. This is imminent. BUT! Do not despair. This is an opportunity for you to become a voice which is heard.<br/><br/>Over the last several decades many companies have switched to ""employee owned."" Hmmm...An interesting thought. <br/><br/>Honestly, I am not advocating anything here other than the ability to be a voice heard. The fact that Etsy has chosen to go public is offering you the Handmade Artist just this opportunity.<br/><br/>It is not that far out of reach. I have followed the Etsy forums closely since the announcement that Etsy would allow manufacturers into the market place. On that day I had a very sick feeling in the pit of my stomach, and I immediately knew that things were about to change quite drastically.<br/><br/><h3><span>My Vision?</span></h3>I am a veteran of cooperative living, and have always firmly believed in living cooperatively. With that said I am not considering myself a leader...At all.

</div></div>","This is a call to Etsy Independent Artisans, Suppliers, and Vintage Sellers to look upon the dramatic changes of Etsy's policies over the last year as an incredible opportunity.Etsy is/has been made up of independent Artisans, Suppliers, and Vintage Sellers which have made it the beautiful market place that it is. Not only are we Artisans, but business owners as well.It has been largely rumoured over the last several days that Etsy is going public. This is imminent. BUT! Do not despair. This is an opportunity for you to become a voice which is heard.Over the last several decades many companies have switched to ""employee owned."" Hmmm...An interesting thought. Honestly, I am not advocating anything here other than the ability to be a voice heard. The fact that Etsy has chosen to go public is offering you the Handmade Artist just this opportunity.It is not that far out of reach.

On that day I had a very sick feeling in the pit of my stomach, and I immediately knew that things were about to change quite drastically.My Vision?I am a veteran of cooperative living, and have always firmly believed in living cooperatively.

Who we are / our idea
Hello everyone ;)
My name is Sanja, I'm married to Dragan, better known by his nickname - Komarac, which means Mosquito. We are in ours 50s and this year we are celebrating 30 years of our marriage. Our three grown children no longer live with us...and here our story begins :)

We are situated in Stari Ledinci, suburbs of Novi Sad, the second largest city in Serbia (Europe), famous by the Exit Music Festival. Our small town is a quiet place only 10km away from the city. It lies in the National Park Fruska Gora, which is a beautiful mountain that, once upon a time, was an island in the Pannonian Sea...
Our life style is turned to nature: eating consisted of food produced in our own organic garden, recycling and composting organic waste, economical use of water and electricity, spending time outside... 
We adopted four cats and a dog, and we also have four horses.Volunteering in a local NGO, which deals with ecology and promotion of recreational activities on Fruska Gora (Dragan leads equestrian club and horse riding school and I'm in charge of a hiking club), gives us an opportunity to meet tourists from various countries. They leave us delighted by the nature, with a desire to stay longer.This knowledge and the fact that currently only my husband and I live in our big house, brought us to our idea, to found a rural tourism household and camping rest areas, where we could host all travelers eager to stay in nature.
Those who choose to stay with us, can expect clean air, sleeping in silence, waking up with the birds chirping, watching the starry skies at night, enjoying the homemade food (if desired - vegetarian, vegan or raw), petting our pets, hiking and horseback riding in nature, collecting edible and healing herbs and mushrooms....but also closeness to a large city with many cultural and historical sights.
  What We Need The money collected this way will be used to renovate and equip our rural tourism household (which will be call Dobro prase / The Good Piglet) and camping rest areas.
2,800 USD - for renovation
5,700 USD - for equipment of bedrooms, kitchen and dinning room
3,500 USD - for equipment of camping rest areas and external area
Renovation works are scheduled for April 15th, until when, we hope, your help will arrive :)
What You Get
We will express our gratitude for your help through the perks that are listed on the right. Anyone can choose a perk that he likes. All perks are guaranteed regardless of whether we reach the target amount of donations through this campaign.
The progress of the renovation work will be able to follow through Facebook page that will be open.
  Other Ways You Can Help You can also help spread the word about our idea - via Facebook, Twitter or by sending emails to your friends and family (use  the Indiegogo share tools).
Thank you
Thank you for your time spent reading this text. It means a lot to me.

Mi smo pedesetogodišnjaci i ove godine proslavljamo 30 godina braka. Naše troje odrasle dece više ne žive sa nama...i tu počinje naša priča :)Živimo u Starim Ledincima, predgrađu Novog Sada, drugog po veličini grada u Srbiji, poznatog i po održavanju EXIT muzičkog festivala. Naše malo mirno mesto je samo 10km udaljeno od grada, na samom obodu NP Fruška gora.Naš stil života je okrenut prirodi: ishrana pretežno hranom proizvedenom u našoj organskoj bašti, reciklaža i kompostiranje organskog otpada, ekonomično korištenje vode i struje, boravak na otvorenom... Udomili smo 4 mačke i psa, a imamo i 4 konja.Volontiramo u lokalnoj NVO koja se bavi ekologijom i promocijom rekreativnih aktivnosti na Fruškoj gori (Dragan vodi konjički klub i školu jahanja, a ja pešački klub). Tu se srećemo sa turistima iz raznih zemalja. Svi oni odlaze oduševljeni prirodom i željni dužeg boravka kod nas.To saznanje i činjenica da trenutno u našoj velikoj kući živimo samo Dragan i ja, dovode nas do naše ideje, a to je osnivanje seoskog turističkog domaćinstva i mini-kamping odmorišta, gde bismo mogli da ugostimo sve putnike željne boravka u prirodi.Oni koji se opredele da borave kod nas, mogu očekivati čist vazduh, spavanje u tišini, buđenje uz cvrkut ptica, posmatranje zvezdanog neba noću, domaću hranu (po želji vegetarijansku, vegansku ili sirovu), maženje naših kućnih ljubimaca, planinarenje ili jahanje u prirodi, sakupljanje jestivog i lekovitog bilja i gljiva...ali i blizinu velikog grada sa brojnim kulturnim i istorijskim znamenitostima.Novac koji prikupimo ovim putem će biti upotrebljen za renoviranje i opremanje budućeg seoskog turističkog domaćinstva (koje će se zvati Dobro prase) i kamping odmorišta.2.800 USD - za renoviranje5.700 USD - za opremanje spavaćih soba, kuhinje i trpezarije3.500 USD - za opremanje kamping odmorišta i spoljašnjeg prostora*cene su izražene u USD radi jednostavnije bankarske transakcijeRadovi na renoviranju su zakazani za 15. april, do kada će, nadamo se, stići vaša pomoć :)Zahvalnost za vašu pomoć ćemo izraziti putem nagrada koje su navedene desno (dostupan je tekst samo na engleskom jeziku - zbog tehničkih mogućnosti na Indiegogo). Svako može odabrati onu nagradu koja mu se najviše sviđa. Sve nagrade su zagarantovane bez obzira da li dostignemo ciljani iznos donacija putem ove kampanje. Napredovanje radova na renoviranju ćete moći da pratite putem Fejsbuk stranice koja će biti otvorena.Takođe, možete pomoći i širenjem priče o našoj ideji - putem Fejsbuka, Tvitera ili slanjem e-mailova vašim prijateljima i porodici (koristite alate koji su postavljeni na Indiegogo).Hvala vam na vašem vremenu koje ste proveli čitajući ovaj tekst. To mi puno znači.Srdačan pozdrav,SanjaP.S.Vidimo se na Fruškoj gori ;)",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p> My name is Ron Berglas and I am the producer and host
of KVCR TV’s INSIGHT with Ron Berglas. KVCR is the public television and radio
station covering The Inland Empire, Coachella Valley, Riverside, and parts of
Los Angeles County. The mission of this show is to provide a public service by
focusing our programs on subjects that will have an immediate impact on the
lives of our viewers. Please feel free to check out my website at <a href=""http://www.insightwithronberglas.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.insightwithronberglas.com</a>
</p>
<p>Our next program will be on the subject of Parental
Alienation Syndrome (PAS), a term coined by Dr. Richard A. Gardner to describe “…a
disorder in which a child, on an ongoing basis, belittles and insults one
parent without justification, due to a combination of factors, including
indoctrination by the other parent.” The clip from the recent Brazilian documentary <strong>A Morte Inventada</strong>
 included above dramatically illustrates the seriousness of the problem.
 Brazil was the first country to make Parental Alienation illegal. <br/></p>
<p>Here are the Eight Symptoms of Parental Alienation Syndrome:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Consistently put down the targeted parent</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Make reasons for their behavior that are weak or
absurd</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Have a lack of ambivalence towards the targeted parent</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Claim that their words and actions are their own</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Be supported in these acts by the alienating parent</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Have an absence of guilt regarding their behavior
toward or the exploitation of</p>
<p>  the targeted parent</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Adopt borrowed scenarios</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Extend the animosity to the targeted parent’s side of
the family</p>
<p>The purpose of this show is to help the psychiatric
and legal professions to understand how their lack of knowledge on this global
and divisive issue has made worse the trauma so many families are presently going
through. Your investment in this show will break open that traditional methodology
and encourage therapists, psychiatrists, mediators, lawyers, and judges, not
only to recognize the PAS dynamic when it is placed in front of them, but to educate
themselves so that they can begin to find new ways to help these families. <br/></p>
<p>The money we raised from the first part of this campaign helped to finance two on- location interviews with Dr. William Bernet and Linda Kase-Gottlieb, two of the foremost experts in the field. <br/></p>
<p>In this second part of our fund raising campaign, we are hoping to raise enough money to get into the studio where we will shoot, edit, and finally market our program in order to alert families, licensed marriage and family therapists who presently are not obliged to learn about Parental Alienation Syndrome, mediators, lawyers, and judges about the terrible damage that is done to children when one parent tries to completely remove those children from the lives of the other parent. All children deserve to be loved by both of their parents. HELP US MAKE THAT POSSIBLE.<br/></p>
<p>On this explosive episode of INSIGHT, we will bring together a panel
of experts as well as alienated
parents, adults who were alienated as children, dramatized readings from family
therapy case notes, and much more. Once it has aired on KVCR, our plan will be
to market the show to other PBS stations as well as to individuals,
groups, universities, libraries, medical and family-orientated establishments
around the country and the world.</p>
<p>The fund raising goal for this show is $5,000, and to
date we have raised a little over $2,000. We have just 60 days to raise the remaining $3,000 so please consider making your tax deductible
donation TODAY to KVCR: Attention Ron Berglas INSIGHT. </p>
<p>On behalf of the thousands of children and their
targeted parents worldwide who have been so profoundly affected, we thank you
for your generous support. </p>
<p>With sincere appreciation,</p>

<p>01/06/16 Update: Thank you for your support and questions. I have made a couple of changes to the campaign per your request. Please keep them coming!</p>
<p>01/04/16 Update: Hello everyone, I hope you had a happy new year! I was just looking at the campaign traffic and it looks like a junior high school dance, you know where everyone shows up but doesn't want to be the first on the floor. We have had 700 hundred different people visit more than once and most have referred other people(Thank you! Dave C. is our top referrer so far). That's OK though, its still really early. So we have made a special get up and dance perk. For just $5 a tree will be planted in your name and we will send you a Living Green Guide that will save you way more than $5! Everybody wins! Also please send me any questions, concerns, comments or dance requests here or on our facebook page <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/myfuturecard"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.facebook.com/myfuturecard</a>. </span></p>

<h3>Our Mission</h3>
<div>
<p><span>   The Future Card is a Public Benefit Corporation that will make premium socially and environmentally responsible investing simple and affordable for everyone.</span>  By way of our unique Visa gift card, clients simply add funds and in turn we invest those funds in environmentally and socially responsible companies, real estate, and commodities.  We make our clients money while at the same time making our planet a better place for all.</p>
<p>   It is our vision to create an affordable investment opportunity that will not only provide an impressive return, but also benefit our environment for generations to come. One of the most popular gifts in the mid-20th century was the U.S. Savings Bond. Parents and grandparents have long considered shares of stock or shares of mutual funds as an excellent gift for young people just learning the concepts of saving and investing.  The Future Card is a 21st century equivalent. </p>

<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">
<p style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;""></p>
<p>   Getting your Future Card lets you take advantage of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Responsible, high-return investing that until now was only available to high income investors                                                                                                                            </li>
<li><p>Access to your money anywhere Visa is accepted including ATMs, on line or even on your phone                                                                                            </p></li>
<li><p>No management fees. No minimum investment. No hidden costs<br/></p></li>
<li><p>Peace of mind that your investments are not contributing to pollution, wage inequality, animal testing, global warming or discrimination</p></li>
<li><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Group investing. Invite family and friends to invest for a specific goal such as a college fund, retirement, emergencies, or a dream vacation</span></p></li>
<li>Availability. Will be in gift card kiosks, in stores and on line                                           </li>
<li><span>Charity. The Future Card is a Public Benefit Corporation. Unlike most companies we do not exist to make ourselves money. It is our sole purpose to make you money while investing in a better world. Profits will be donated to responsible organizations such as World Wildlife Fund, Sea Shepherd Society, UNICEF, Greenpeace and Amnesty International                                                              </span></li>
<li><span>An effortless way to save for the future and invest in a better world – all at the same time!</span></li>

 why we created the Future Card. First, you don't have to select a perk.
 Donations of even $1 are greatly appreciated and add up. You can also 
be an incredible help by spreading the word. Tell everyone you know on 
Facebook, Twitter, G+ and LinkedIn. When we achieve our stretch goal the
 top referrer perk is a Tesla electric car!<br/>  Volunteer for a non profit! There are many organizations that are in desperate need of help. You can help out with a local charity or pick your favorite non profit  and champion their cause on social media.<b><br/> </b><br/><h3></h3>

</div>","01/06/16 Update: Thank you for your support and questions. I have made a couple of changes to the campaign per your request. Please keep them coming!
01/04/16 Update: Hello everyone, I hope you had a happy new year! I was just looking at the campaign traffic and it looks like a junior high school dance, you know where everyone shows up but doesn't want to be the first on the floor. We have had 700 hundred different people visit more than once and most have referred other people(Thank you! Dave C. is our top referrer so far). That's OK though, its still really early. So we have made a special get up and dance perk. For just $5 a tree will be planted in your name and we will send you a Living Green Guide that will save you way more than $5! Everybody wins! Also please send me any questions, concerns, comments or dance requests here or on our facebook page www.facebook.com/myfuturecard. 



What Is The Future Card?
Our Mission

   The Future Card is a Public Benefit Corporation that will make premium socially and environmentally responsible investing simple and affordable for everyone.  By way of our unique Visa gift card, clients simply add funds and in turn we invest those funds in environmentally and socially responsible companies, real estate, and commodities.  We make our clients money while at the same time making our planet a better place for all.
   It is our vision to create an affordable investment opportunity that will not only provide an impressive return, but also benefit our environment for generations to come. One of the most popular gifts in the mid-20th century was the U.S. Savings Bond. Parents and grandparents have long considered shares of stock or shares of mutual funds as an excellent gift for young people just learning the concepts of saving and investing.  The Future Card is a 21st century equivalent. 



   Getting your Future Card lets you take advantage of:

Responsible, high-return investing that until now was only available to high income investors                                                                                                                            
Access to your money anywhere Visa is accepted including ATMs, on line or even on your phone                                                                                            
No management fees. No minimum investment. No hidden costs
Peace of mind that your investments are not contributing to pollution, wage inequality, animal testing, global warming or discrimination
Group investing. Invite family and friends to invest for a specific goal such as a college fund, retirement, emergencies, or a dream vacation
Availability. Will be in gift card kiosks, in stores and on line                                           
Charity. The Future Card is a Public Benefit Corporation. Unlike most companies we do not exist to make ourselves money. It is our sole purpose to make you money while investing in a better world. Profits will be donated to responsible organizations such as World Wildlife Fund, Sea Shepherd Society, UNICEF, Greenpeace and Amnesty International                                                              
An effortless way to save for the future and invest in a better world – all at the same time!



Why Future Card?
 
   Everyday the news shows us more crimes against the environment and more people suffering. The rich keep getting richer, companies keep polluting and the average person works harder for less money. The Future Card is the solution. 



 50% of everyone in the United States have no savings. No money for emergencies, college or retirement. The average savings account yields less than 1% interest. The top investment funds have yielded more than 40% interest but require minimum deposits of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Most of the Forbes 500 made their fortunes with investing, all have significantly increased their wealth with investments. By combining funds we are able to make available high return investing for everyone and as easy as buying a soda.                                                                                                                                 

50% of all wildlife and 50% of the worlds forests we had 50 years ago are gone forever. Unethical corporations are the number one cause of poverty, pollution, deforestation, global warming, animal abuse and wage inequality. Most mutual funds, ETFs, and hedge funds invest in these companies allowing them to continue their horrible practices. We screen all of our investments not only to exclude unethical companies but also to support those that help the environment and society. By defunding irresponsible companies and supporting growing ethical businesses we not only realize a high return for our customers but become a major force in securing a better future for all.







Why It Works...
  Gift cards are a 100 billion dollar a year industry. They are in virtually every store. But what do you really get? Basically 80 cents on the dollar and 40% are unused. Imagine instead giving someone a gift card for college tuition, retirement or a dream vacation. A gift card that never expires and actually gains value. That is the Future Card. 

   According to Geoff Burnand (Chief Executive, Investing for Good) the growth of responsible investing has been rapid, in part mirroring the rise of venture capital in the 1980s and in 10 years the operating environment will be unrecognizable. Sir Ronald Cohen, widely regarded as Father of British Venture Capital said, “Impact investing is the next Big Thing. Society cannot continue to cope with prevailing social issues in the traditional way. We need to harness entrepreneurship, innovation and capital to achieve in the social area what they have achieved in the creation and growth of entrepreneurial firms in general, and technology firms in particular”. 
   There are a number of sectors which have high growth potential for impact investment such as health care, renewable energy, green housing, arts, sport/fitness and education projects. Climate change initiatives and legislation alone will require an estimated $10 trillion in investment before 2020 to fund development of the low-carbon energy economy. At the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference 196 countries pledged to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 55% by 2030 and 100% by 2050. Imagine investing in cars and oil when everyone was still riding horses. The only difference now is that there are 5,000,000,000 more consumers.

</div></div>","Short Summary
 We are inventing a silicon putty which can do lots of things, such as repairing, form a shock absorbing layer, make object non-slippery, give protection, fill holes, make decoration, etc… 
   What We Need & What You Get

We need funding for several areas, the R&D on formulation, product testing, and most importantly the material necessary for production. 
For everyone who contribute, we make sure you receive a product (even if we don't achieve our goal .)

The Impact With your help on funding, we can launch this product sooner. 

What is Wrap-ber™?

Wrap-ber™ is a silicon putty that settles and cures quickly. It is durable, waterproof, cold and heat resistant. You can shape and wrap this product on almost any surface, such as metal, wood, plastics, tile, glass, etc...

Wrap-ber™ is a shape free silicon dough, that cures after compounds A & B are mixed together. After cured, it has infinite applications, such as cushioning hard object, making objects non-slippery, forming a protective layer, filling holes, making decoration, etc… 
It is not only about fixing and repairing, we design Wrap-ber™ for many more usages. There are many things we can make better to fit your lifestyle.










Advantage of Wrap-ber™







Wrap-ber™ consists of two compounds (A and B), they are packaged
separately in the box and will therefore never react until the user mixes the
two together. This is why Wrap-ber™ will never expire or dry out.



Compounds A and B are packaged in different shapes (circle and
square) for users to easily identify which is which.




The two different colors of the A and B silicon dough, allows the
user to tell if Wrap-ber™ is mixed well. 









How Wrap-ber™ works? 


Mix Wrap-ber™ A and B in 1:1 ratio, and mold onto the desired object.  
Wrap-ber™ A and B must mix together for at least 3 minutes to create the necessary reaction.  
Wrap-ber™ A and B must be thoroughly mixed together, or it will affect the cure performance.  
After the mixing process has completed, Wrap-ber™ will begin to cure anytime from 4 to 24 hours, depending on the air temperature. 





Thank you to Wrap-ber™ unique property, it is now much easier for engineering development.  It can make molds, electric insulator, flexible cover, fill holes, etc...

<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Our Goals<br/>
</h3> <ul> <li>Currently all our fundraising is directed towards building a free clinic
 in the village of Argora in India. The free clinic is estimated to cost
 around US$35,000. <br/>
</li>
<li>Once the clinic is built, the average cost of running
 it is estimated to be approximately US$15,000/year. </li>
<li>At the clinic it will cost only $1.20 to treat each patient.</li>
</ul>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b>The Impact<br/>
</b></h3>
<p></p>
</div><div>
<p>According to the World Health Organization, approximately 30% of the 
world’s population does not have access to essential medical care. Many 
men, women, and children living in developing countries lack access to 
many basic health care services, resulting in high rates of morbidity 
and mortality. Physicians of Oath (PO) works to provide free medical 
care and assistance to populations who have no means of receiving care. 
Our goal is to open up medical clinics in developing countries, provide 
medical advice and care, in rural areas where health services are 
otherwise unavailable. PO will not charge any fees for such services. If
 PO cannot provide a specific medical service, our organization will try
 to find the appropriate accommodations for the patients in critical 
need. We have an open door and walk in policy.</p>
<p>Our doctors (majority of them being board members) will travel to India and 
work at the free clinic for a set duration of time. Our doctors might 
travel alone or in groups, depending on their work schedules. Once 
there, we will collaborate with local doctors and nurses at the clinic, 
and share the newest and best medical information available. Member 
physicians will travel to rural places for a short duration through the 
year, work with the locals and manage the clinic, come back and report 
to the entire board, and plan ahead as needed.</p>

<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Making a Difference<br/>
</h3> <p> </p>
<p>Western currency is more valuable in the developing world. $1 US is 
equal to 60 rupees in India, which can be a week’s salary for many 
people. We can provide people with amazing heath care and proper 
medication and improve their life by donating funds and time. Physicians
 of Oath provides what most medical organizations usually do not - Board
 certified American and Canadian Physicians and their expertise in 
geographical areas where basic medical care is unavailable. On top of 
providing emergency relief, our organization amalgamates with the local 
populations, treats illnesses through preventative measures (i.e. 
regular clinic and home visits), and introduces the concept of primary 
medical care to the less fortunate. </p>
<p> </p>Physicians of Oath’s actions are guided by Hippocrates, often referred 
to as the “Father of Medicine,” and his ideals of the selfless 
dedication to the preservation of human life.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1126395/files/20150101180453-mock2.jpg?1420164293"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

#ProjectArgora
 Argora is a project that is planned in India, close to the city of 
Ranchi. There are many people in and 
around the village who require essential medical care but cannot afford 
it or don’t have access to it. Physicians of Oath will provide medical 
aid to the inhabitants of the village and fill the void of health care 
by setting up an easily accessible medical clinic which will be open to 
everyone who walks in. We already have the doctors and nurses in our team ready to go, all we need is the infrastructure!The People in need

Meet
 Goalu. One of the inhabitants of our village in India. He is 6 years 
old, is in grade 1, does well in school, and loves to play videogames on
 my phone (draining its entire battery life). He will be one of the many
 children our free hospital will vaccinate against measles, mumps, 
rubella, hepatitis A, rota-virus, influenza, etc.
 Providing 
vaccinations and medications to children, pregnant women, and the 
elderly is one of the major reasons we need to build this medical facility
 in Argora, India. People there do not have access to the most basic 
medical needs. In essence, the cost of treating 1 patient will be $1. 



Meet Chotku. He is 7 and has just entered grade 2. He is eager to learn and loves to read books. He also loves to rides his red-yellow bike to school - even when the streets are flooded from the heavy monsoon rains. Chotku sometimes gets terrible ear infections (Otitis Media), which causes him to become sick with dangerous fevers, falling behind in his important studies. Our free clinic would help provide the appropriate antibiotics which could cure simple ear infections such as the one Chotku gets. The medications have been around for decades, however, many people don't have access to them. Help us build this infrastructure through which Chotku and others like him can get the antibiotics  and free medical care they so desperately need. 
Help the elderly! We will be providing preventive medical assistance to the elderly population. Providing medication for hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes. Giving them advice on changes in life style to live a healthier and longer life.    YES! We are physically going to the village to build and maintain this free clinic!Good news! We have already acquired the land required 
to build our free medical clinic! We plan to build a clinic in Argora, 
and initially hire local physicians and nurses to provide care. American
 and Canadian physicians will later guide, control, and manage the 
clinic, both virtually and physically.
                            
                       		Starting now, we are raising  funds to build
 our free medical clinic. For that we need your encouragement and 
support. So join us, and help us in proving medical aid to the less 
fortunate.


   Our Goals
  Currently all our fundraising is directed towards building a free clinic
 in the village of Argora in India. The free clinic is estimated to cost
 around US$35,000. 

Once the clinic is built, the average cost of running
 it is estimated to be approximately US$15,000/year. 
At the clinic it will cost only $1.20 to treat each patient.


The Impact



According to the World Health Organization, approximately 30% of the 
world’s population does not have access to essential medical care. Many 
men, women, and children living in developing countries lack access to 
many basic health care services, resulting in high rates of morbidity 
and mortality. Physicians of Oath (PO) works to provide free medical 
care and assistance to populations who have no means of receiving care. 
Our goal is to open up medical clinics in developing countries, provide 
medical advice and care, in rural areas where health services are 
otherwise unavailable. PO will not charge any fees for such services. If
 PO cannot provide a specific medical service, our organization will try
 to find the appropriate accommodations for the patients in critical 
need. We have an open door and walk in policy.
Our doctors (majority of them being board members) will travel to India and 
work at the free clinic for a set duration of time. Our doctors might 
travel alone or in groups, depending on their work schedules. Once 
there, we will collaborate with local doctors and nurses at the clinic, 
and share the newest and best medical information available. Member 
physicians will travel to rural places for a short duration through the 
year, work with the locals and manage the clinic, come back and report 
to the entire board, and plan ahead as needed.



  Making a Difference
  
Western currency is more valuable in the developing world. $1 US is 
equal to 60 rupees in India, which can be a week’s salary for many 
people. We can provide people with amazing heath care and proper 
medication and improve their life by donating funds and time. Physicians
 of Oath provides what most medical organizations usually do not - Board
 certified American and Canadian Physicians and their expertise in 
geographical areas where basic medical care is unavailable. On top of 
providing emergency relief, our organization amalgamates with the local 
populations, treats illnesses through preventative measures (i.e. 
regular clinic and home visits), and introduces the concept of primary 
medical care to the less fortunate. 
 Physicians of Oath’s actions are guided by Hippocrates, often referred 
to as the “Father of Medicine,” and his ideals of the selfless 
dedication to the preservation of human life.

<p>We have plans to run book clubs for all ages, to host author signings and book launches, and to work closely with local groups such as schools and festivals so that World's Finest Books can become a community space.

In the future we would also like to hold an annual short story competition, with the winners being published in a book collection that we would stock.<br/></p>
<p>We both feel strongly that this is a shop that will enhance the West End of Glasgow.

</div>
<p><span><b>Trust –</b></span>
The lack of trust in electronic means of payment continues to be a worldwide
deterrent to online shoppers. However, due to our partnership with Shopify Inc. (a reputable internet hosting and security company), GidwayExpress.com has been able to minimize the lack of trust by customers. </p>
<p><span><b>Resistance to change –</b></span> Online shopping is relatively new compared to the traditional way of transacting buying and selling business. It is therefore obvious that changing from the old way to the new way of doing things will bring about resistance (change is naturally resisted). Gidway is trying to overcome this through vigorous awareness campaign. </p><p><b>Lack of internet access -</b> People living in rural communities particularly in Africa have no access to the internet and hence are unable to shop online. With African governments waking up to their responsibilities of developing the rural communities, it is hoped that accessibility to internet will spread across the continent.</p>

Also with a successful crowdfunding we will be set to go
into more partnership with international organisations which include but not
limited to the companies mentioned in the graphic display below:
Certainly, the sum of $375,234 is not enough to expand an eCommerce to a global standard. However, the amount being sought is needed to lay a foundation which will be built upon as progress is made. The fund will also enable us to introduce GidwayExpress.com to the global online market. 

We’re here to help businesses and consumers. Our goal is to
be able to change the way business is conducted (in Africa). Traditional
intermediary functions will be replaced, new products and markets will be
developed, and new relationships will be created between businesses and
consumers.  Please take note of the following:


Our platform will enable customers to shop or do
other transactions 24/7, from all locations with internet
access.


We will be able to provide prompt delivery services to
customers worldwide.


We will be able to maintain substantial discounts and after sales services.


Our platform will enable people in the rural
areas to enjoy products and services that otherwise are not available to them.



Building a viable and profitable eCommerce business is fraught with a number of challenges which include the following: 

Trust –
The lack of trust in electronic means of payment continues to be a worldwide
deterrent to online shoppers. However, due to our partnership with Shopify Inc. (a reputable internet hosting and security company), GidwayExpress.com has been able to minimize the lack of trust by customers. 
Resistance to change – Online shopping is relatively new compared to the traditional way of transacting buying and selling business. It is therefore obvious that changing from the old way to the new way of doing things will bring about resistance (change is naturally resisted). Gidway is trying to overcome this through vigorous awareness campaign. Lack of internet access - People living in rural communities particularly in Africa have no access to the internet and hence are unable to shop online. With African governments waking up to their responsibilities of developing the rural communities, it is hoped that accessibility to internet will spread across the continent.
Your support will enable GidwayExpress.com to overcome the challenges highlighted above and hence flourish. If we reach our goal
of this campaign, we will be able to take GidwayExpress.com to the next level in
an unprecedented manner.

For a long time now, Africa has
been limited in the areas of funding, accessibility to the internet, as well as other technological developments. All these have negatively affected the development of eCommerce in the continent. 
We believe that raising funds from Indiegogo will enable us overcome some of the above mentioned challenges.

We hope our perks are the kind
of cool stuff you would love to hold and cherish. You would certainly be delighted to have them. They have all been designed and crafted by some of Africa’s
greatest minds. We assure you that all funds received by us will be transparently accounted for as well as judiciously utilized. Indeed, helping Gidway in this regard will go a long way in promoting the well being and happiness of humanity.

The island <span style=""background-color: initial;"">is home to nearly 20,000 refugees, displaced after the 1994 Rwandan genocide. It is estimated that over 80% of the island does not have a steady income.

</div><div><br/></div><div>In addition to illiteracy, an issue these women face is the prevalent Congolese culture, which dictates a system where men believe they are kings and women their property. A man takes a woman (as young as 12-15 years old) and builds her a house. She is responsible for conceiving every year, providing all food and income, farming, transporting materials from Kamembe and other forms of manual labor. When these duties are not fulfilled to the man's expectations, the man finds another wife and builds her a house on the same land.</div><div><br/></div><div>These women are so eager to rise above poverty and their current way of life.

Over the past two years, Hands Producing Hope has been working in Costa Rica, developing relationships with a group of Guaymi Indigenous women in the remote village of Coppey Abajo and learning about their greatest needs.

</div></div>","We are Hands Producing Hope, a social enterprise with a heart for seeing families flourish, children fed and educated, women empowered and communities thriving! We need your help to grow our impact and start a program in Rwanda, specifically Nkombo Island.For the past two years, our hearts have been steadily moved by the people of Nkombo Island. The island is home to nearly 20,000 refugees, displaced after the 1994 Rwandan genocide. It is estimated that over 80% of the island does not have a steady income. Most women are not able to read or write, as less than 25% of children go to school and, of these, almost none finish.
In addition to illiteracy, an issue these women face is the prevalent Congolese culture, which dictates a system where men believe they are kings and women their property. A man takes a woman (as young as 12-15 years old) and builds her a house. She is responsible for conceiving every year, providing all food and income, farming, transporting materials from Kamembe and other forms of manual labor. When these duties are not fulfilled to the man's expectations, the man finds another wife and builds her a house on the same land.These women are so eager to rise above poverty and their current way of life. When women have the money to buy their own land, they are no longer responsible to the man, and they are free to take their children and leave.That's where Hands Producing Hope comes in.






Over the past two years, Hands Producing Hope has been working in Costa Rica, developing relationships with a group of Guaymi Indigenous women in the remote village of Coppey Abajo and learning about their greatest needs. We have developed a program that touches the lives of a community that might not have otherwise experienced respect, dignity and hope for a brighter future:
22 women have consistent, sustainable work that also allows them to stay at home and care for their children
Through our workshops, these women (along with their families) have planted and harvested their own flourishing gardens, learned the importance of personal hygiene, and began setting aside money for the future

4 of the women received scholarships that allowed them to continue attending school - for one of them, even in her mid-thirties, she was able to fulfill her dream of going to high school

Through our program in Costa Rica, we have witnessed a community of lives changed and empowered. And we are just getting started!


We are ready to develop a program on Nkombo Island that will invest in the lives of the women on the island by offering education, employment and life skills workshops that will equip them with the tools necessary to rise above poverty and radically change the lives of these women & their children.
In order to make this happen, we need $20,000 to charter our Rwanda Program. Our goal is to secure funding to:

employ staff on the ground to personally oversee the program's development
offer consistent training to a group of women who will be our newest artisans
provide an allowance that will allow the women to attend training classes with their children instead of working in the fields
host a variety of life skills workshops to help equip these women
set aside for scholarships for the women and their children to attend school
purchase start-up supplies & place an initial order!

<i><span><strong><span>How A Cat Café Works </span></strong> </span>  <br/></i>
</h3>
<p><span>A
cat café is a themed establishment, the attraction of which is the company of
cats. At pHinicky pHeline, guests will pay a cover fee 
(generally hourly) to enter the café and are able to enjoy refreshments and mingle while engaging with the cats. <span></span>
</span></p>
<p>Additionally, we plan to have a wine
bar in the evening to further encourage patrons to spend quality time with our
pHelines into the later hours of the day.</p>

Guests will be able to book hourly reservations at the cat café (while walk-ins will be welcome, we anticipate a high demand for this wonderful experience). And should you fall in love with one of our pHelines (which we are hoping) and want to become a pet parent, your adoption will be handled solely by our animal rescue partner and its process.  <br/> <p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>
<i>What It Takes</i><br/>
</h3> <p>Needless to say, opening a cat café is costly, complicated and can take time when it's done the right way. But that is not deterring us from our goal. Currently, we are:</p>

<li>investigating the best possible partners/adoption entities that will supply our pHelines.</li>

It's amazing how far I have come with Bloody Amazing Mary Mix, from its inception while employed as F&B manager at a golf course restaurantto overseeing production runs.

 


Bloody Amazing is growing.  
Since Bloody Amazing Mary Mix's launch in April 2014,feedback and reviews have been remarkable,light-years beyond what I could have imagined.

Bloody Amazing now has a major distributor and is currently workingon a significant promotion opportunity with a very well known vodka brand. 

Bloody Amazing is currently distributed throughout the state of Georgia, and is reaching into neighboring states to expand distributionto broaden product availability.  We are excited that distribution interest has spawned in the northeast.
I foresee great opportunities and abundant growth ahead.

So this is why I have designed this page.   To raise capital to accomplish: 

Effective marketing campaigns to broaden Bloody Amazing's ""pour"" reach
