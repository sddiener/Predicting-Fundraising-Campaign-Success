<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>       <i>The Musicians International</i>  is an extensive collection of original film clips with the specific purposes of encouraging young audience to explore the vast field of orchestral music. It is also a means of putting the work of young musicians out in front of a wide, internet-based audience.</p>
<p>        The players creating this music are accomplished international-class musicians whose talent, enthusiasm and determination is deeply inspiring. This winning combination deserves to reach the widest possible audience, especially the peers of these kids who may never have listened to this kind of music before. This is why I have already devoted five years to developing the project. </p>
<p>       And to me, they are kids; I'm 75, while both the target audience and the players are aged between 14 and 24, with some overflow at either end. A career as a professional musician is one of the most difficult career paths of all, and those who choose it do so because it is their passion.     </p>
<p>       Just so that you know, the older generations aren't being left out; there is plenty here for us as well. </p>
<p>       That said, the zeal and excitement that these young players put into their music has immense appeal, and their concert-hall and open-air performances attract large, appreciative audiences. The choice of music offered by <i>The Musicians International </i> will continue to grow as I am able to film at venues in other parts of Australia, Asia, the UK and the USA.  </p>
<p>       This project began in 2011 as part of my doctoral research into the impact of digital technology on documentary production. The making of a 55-minute documentary, <i>The Musicians</i>, was an integral part of this work. This film is based on the career paths of several young musicians from the Western Australian Youth Orchestra and other WA ensembles. However, the story that emerged demanded far more coverage than a single film could provide. So, <i>The Musicians</i> became the launch-pad for this more extensive multi-media project. </p>

<h3>A filmmaker's perspective</h3>
<h3>   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489211821/kfzrjlwreaospggkn4bo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
</h3>
<p>       I have been a professional filmmaker for the past 45 years, and most of my 60-or-so broadcast films on wildlife and the performing arts have made extensive use of both traditional and contemporary orchestral music. </p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/200750415?portrait=0""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">A 30-second clip of some of my work   </p>
<p>       <i>The Musicians International </i>will bring a range of orchestral music to the conscious attention younger audiences, I say ""conscious attention"" because the whole gamut of orchestral music is now commonly heard in film and television sound tracks, so at least the sound of it is already familiar. This project provides the detail to encourage further audience engagement. </p>
<p>       In the course of my research, I filmed a great deal of performance by young musicians. This large stock of raw material, combined with the increasing importance of the internet in our day-to-day lives, convinced me that now is the time for<i>The Musicians Project</i> to happen; to bring an understanding and appreciation of orchestral music to a new world-wide audience.</p>
<p>       Part of a documentary-maker's brief is to preserve the past. In the clip below, two performances of the same piece have been recorded  at different times and in different places, and played by the same artist ... the remarkable piano prodigy, Shuan Hern Lee.  When combined, they provide an interesting example of the passage of time. .   </p>

<p><i>Shuan Hern Lee plays a Chopin Etude.     </i>        </p>
</div>
<p>       A pivotal role of <i>The Musicians International</i> is to show the human face of orchestral music. Young musicians will be encouraged to tell their own stories; to reveal themselves as individuals who are real people with talent and purpose. Rather than providing just a string of exhibition pieces, this project will show something of the music-making process, and the fierce drive, blood, sweat and tears that go into a life of performance.  </p>
</div>
<p>       <i>The Musicians International</i> will explain what an orchestra is, how it works, and say something about the instruments that make it up. Very much ""orchestral music without tears"". </p>

<p><i>This 3-minute excerpt from the </i>Haydn Trumpet Concerto <i>played by the student-developed Swan Philharmonic orchestra, combines both rehearsals and performance footage.</i></p>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<p>       Considering that I am well past my teenage years,  I will gather a support team from the target generation, partly drawn from dedicated music academies in Western Australia, and partly from similar sources in the UK and USA.  This team of six to eight teenagers will be  familiar with what people their age are looking for in terms of entertainment, how they negotiate and access web-based information, and how the website/library should be designed to best suite their preferred viewing platforms; that is, tablets, laptops  and smartphones. Members of this team will be comfortable working with modern communications technology as well as being musicians in their own right. </p>
<p>      To balance this, there will be myself and at least two members of the older generation to ensure that the end product also has application to vintages beyond the primary target audience. Developing the web site functions from a distance can be easily  achieved via teleconferencing.  </p>
<h3>Why is <i>The Musicians International</i> important?<i>  </i>
</h3>
<p>        There is a rumour that interest in orchestral music is dying out.</p>
<p>        While most musicians and members of concert audiences may not necessarily agree, there is a trend for young people to not be exposed to traditional orchestral music. It is possible that their parents weren't exposed to it either, or even <i>their </i>parents.   </p>
<p>        By showing young musicians at work, <i>The Musicians International  </i>will demonstrate that orchestral music is not something mysterious or elitist, and has a significant place in our lives. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489457079/dotqggzhgjnatnrisd5u.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>       The interactive nature of <i>The Musicians International</i>  website will encourage young people to embark on their own exploration of what orchestral music is all about and how they can be involved in it; more importantly, they may already be involved without realising it. </p>
<p>       <i>The Musicians International</i>  is also a means of sharing the emotional depth that orchestral music can promote within us. Our emotional responses to music are some of the strongest associations we have with life events, individuals, and life processes, including loss. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488504013/ihbryj82ohegivaidcbr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>       This photo of my wife Gwenda and myself, taken in early January, 2002, was the last photo that we had taken together. On the 5th. of March, 2002, Gwenda died from the ravages of pancreatic cancer. </p>
<p>       During the months that followed the diagnosis and its inevitable outcome, our home was frequently filled with the richness of our favourite classical and popular orchestral music. Apart from being a source of peace and pleasure, this music was also a source of strength, which was very much needed in our lives at that time. I firmly believe that this level of personal enrichment is valuable and worth sharing. </p>
<p>       Later, as I began to further research classical music, I became increasingly aware that so many young people could gain so much from the power that orchestral music has to affect our lives in so many positive ways. This strongly influenced me to begin creating this resource that will ultimately become <i>The Musicians International. </i></p>
<h3>Getting the best out of the project </h3>
<p>        Whether filming wildlife or an orchestra, it is critical to remain invisible and not become part of the event being filmed. It is also essential to get the best imagery possible to create the strongest connection between the viewer and the subject. With this in mind, I use the smallest cameras available that provide quality results. As with most modern technology, the quality and compactness of film equipment is constantly being improved. Over the past few years, High Definition equipment has become outdated, virtually redundant, and Ultra High Definition (UHD and 4K) is the new standard filming medium.</p>
<p>   Ultra Hight Definition equipment creates images that provide the filmmaker with much greater creative flexibility while working at a greater distance from the players. These smaller cameras can also be placed within the orchestra, and controlled remotely without being in any way disruptive. Thus everyone's job is made easier, with much better results.  <i>  </i></p>
<h3>Timing, crowdfunding and distribution</h3>
<p>       Filming of this kind requires patience, a detailed knowledge of the subject, a great deal of trust on the part of the musicians concerned, and, or course, time. And in any language, time is money</p>
<p>       The initial  collection of some 50 topic-specific film clips plus background information can  be completed within nine months of commencement. The web site will continue to develop from thereon in, and will become part of the well-established educational organisation, <i>Storyteller Media </i>(<a href=""http://www.storyteller.com.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.storyteller.com.au/</a>). This will ensure that the project continues to move forward, and will receive maximum exposure and distribution.   </p>
<p>    An important aspect of funding the project  through <i>Indiegogo</i> is that it can be created free of outside influences. As an experienced independent filmmaker, I can work far more efficiently and cost-effectively using my own proven methods. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The project budget </h3>
<p>       To achieve the level of professional results that this long-term project deserves, I will buy (rather than hire) up-to-date cameras and accessories. Modern compact production equipment is not fiendishly expensive, but it isn't cheap either. Because of the long duration of this project, it is far more economical to purchase rather than hire equipment.  My estimate for additional filming equipment on current pricing is $19,000.</p>
<p>       To meet some of the costs of airfares and accommodation within Australia, and travel to the UK and USA to work with young musicians in these places, I have included a budget of $12,000. I anticipate augmenting this part of the budget by doing some industry-level teaching and developing some saleable footage in the process. </p>
<p>       For additional equipment costs, including computer hard drives for footage storage, I have allowed $6,000</p>
<p>       If there is a shortfall in the proposed budget, the project will still go ahead using exisiting footage and my own resources as necessary. Long-term development will continue, but at a slower pace. This notwithstanding, support from contributors to boost the development that I have already undertaken will see <i>The Musicians International </i>become a viable reality, and a valuable resource.   </p>

<p>The NINE BEATS Collective has come together to make a soundscape of songs, instrumentals and spoken word that explores the ancient wisdom known as 'The Beatitudes' – and we’d love to invite you to help us make it happen!</p>
<p>Why are we so passionate about this project? Because these words speak about another world being possible, another way of being human: in these turbulent times, could they actually offer us steps to a new reality? NINE BEATS explores these powerful notions - and presents them back to the culture around us through music and art.</p>
<p><i>“The arts and theology and spiritual formation are really great conversation partners because…we’re invited to question the assumptions of the systems that we are part of … they point out that the emperor has no clothes on and then invoke the possibility of newness to come … there’s a longing inside of us for another world, something better than what’s here right now … the Beatitudes invite us in to that possibility and say there is a new way to be human, another world is possible.” Mark Scandrette – author &amp; speaker</i></p>

<p>These NINE BEATS are ancient words that on the face of it might seem unfashionable: they’re found in the Bible, spoken by Jesus – and yet a closer look reveals they are bursting with startling relevance to today.

With all that’s happening culturally and politically, we think this unique album has a timely theme. It’s got a great cast of international artists and different cultural vibes, something really compelling and intriguing. You can help us make it a reality!</p>
<p>If we exceed our £10k target, that will be just fantastic because we can then look at things like visuals, live events and at our other ideas like digital and physical resources to help people explore the NINE BEATS for themselves.</p>
<p><strong><i>Risks and challenges</i></strong></p>
<p>All of us involved have a solid track record in the music, art, film, creative and even academic/theology worlds: we’ve delivered many albums and films and we’re just <i>so </i>excited about this concept, the ‘heart’ of this project.</p>
<p>The main funders thus far, whilst not in the music industry, do have a 128-year heritage of creatively communicating Bible content through art, booklets, live programmes and community projects across the globe.</p>
<p>Any challenges, we believe, can be confidently handled by this great group of professionals and artists – if we fail to achieve our targets, we’ll still press ahead and seek other avenues – we’d just prefer the people to speak and journey with us!</p>

We've toured more than 40 cities and towns, from Massachusetts to Texas to Iowa and back again. Over seven years we have spent more than $50,000 on recordings, touring, duplication, rehearsal space and a short yellow school bus. It has all been worth it.</span><br/></p><p></p><p>Now, here we are. Standing at the edge of that precipice, our next record. We've got the songs. We just need you.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h2><b>A Story About Living and Dying</b></h2><p>In his early 40s, Elijah's father was diagnosed with young-onset Parkinson's. Over the last of their time together, Jedd tried a series of cures, from conventional to alternative medicine, to hopeful miracle. Elijah traveled with Jedd through India. He lived with him through the genius and abuse of a German scientist—trying everything geography, medical communities, and the internet had to offer. The hope for a cure did not succeed in distracting them from the depression, memory loss, sleep deprivation, and pain of trying to die with grace, while maintaining hope.</p><p>Here in America, we hunger for luxury, ease, and longevity. Yet so often we satisfy that hunger at the expense of other people’s lives. How many years do we have a right to live? How much violence does it take to keep ourselves alive and feeling good? What is the physical and psychological toll of that violence? What is it, in this arrangement, that we are so addicted to? We hope this album will be a companion to others who are feeling lost in the adventure of life and death in the Golden Age.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>
<b>We're Not Just Making a Record. <br/></b><b>We're Making a Community. </b>
</h3><p>We believe our music should be heard by listeners around the world, from our local scene to far beyond. It should be recorded with talented professionals, and top-notch equipment that will effectively capture the sounds we create. Yet in today's financial climate—in business, in music, and beyond—it is nearly impossible to do what we are trying to do. </p><p>We don't really need another record.

</div><h2>Thank You!  We love you.</h2><h4>    hawk + dove</h4></div>","We Are Hawk and Dove.  For seven years we have been playing the kind of haunting, furious, psychedelic music that accompanies your fitful dreams on a humid summer night.We have recorded demos, an EP and a full-length record. We've toured more than 40 cities and towns, from Massachusetts to Texas to Iowa and back again. Over seven years we have spent more than $50,000 on recordings, touring, duplication, rehearsal space and a short yellow school bus. It has all been worth it.Now, here we are. Standing at the edge of that precipice, our next record. We've got the songs. We just need you.A Story About Living and DyingIn his early 40s, Elijah's father was diagnosed with young-onset Parkinson's. Over the last of their time together, Jedd tried a series of cures, from conventional to alternative medicine, to hopeful miracle. Elijah traveled with Jedd through India. He lived with him through the genius and abuse of a German scientist—trying everything geography, medical communities, and the internet had to offer. The hope for a cure did not succeed in distracting them from the depression, memory loss, sleep deprivation, and pain of trying to die with grace, while maintaining hope.Here in America, we hunger for luxury, ease, and longevity. Yet so often we satisfy that hunger at the expense of other people’s lives. How many years do we have a right to live? How much violence does it take to keep ourselves alive and feeling good? What is the physical and psychological toll of that violence? What is it, in this arrangement, that we are so addicted to? We hope this album will be a companion to others who are feeling lost in the adventure of life and death in the Golden Age.
We're Not Just Making a Record. We're Making a Community. 
We believe our music should be heard by listeners around the world, from our local scene to far beyond. It should be recorded with talented professionals, and top-notch equipment that will effectively capture the sounds we create. Yet in today's financial climate—in business, in music, and beyond—it is nearly impossible to do what we are trying to do. We don't really need another record. What we truly need, and what we have been chasing all these years, is a way to make more art, and more community. To travel and sing and perform, and share more days with more of you. In these [extra]ordinarily perilous times, when even going about our daily business can be rife with violence and fear, we feel a deep need to build. We don't claim to have any answers, but we do believe that participating in a rich dialogue is a necessary part of any attempt to live and die with grace.The Budget:To record and promote this album, we need to raise $19,483. + $3000 for engineering, mixing, and use of a small studio+ $1000 two days' time in a large studio w/ isolated rooms to track the rhythm+ $2900 to pay musicians who can play instruments we can't  + $1000 to master both the digital and vinyl editions of the record+ $2276 for vinyl production+ $1200 for album art/package design+ $6000 for a 4-month promotional campaign ($1500/month)+ $550 for merchandise and postage perk fulfillment + $1,558 for Indiegogo and CC/Paypal Fees-they take 8% (5% & 3%)  Total   $19,483

<li>The Solar panels will power our laptops and cell phones as well as provide free power for people to charge their phones during events. All 100% green. A little bit of power can go a long way in terms of lighting, phone charging and basic needs. The less we use the generator the better, solar panels are the answer.  It's a big black bus 
that soaks up sunlight all day and we would like to harness that and use
 it. <br/>
</li>
<li>Repair the AC. It needs to be replaced and will cost approx $2500. This is an expensive repair but crucial come May, it gets hot in the bus real quick. With the windows painted shut it leaves very little room for fresh air. Living on a bus is pretty awesome until it hits 80 and there's no AC. <br/>
</li>
<li>Converting the engine to process biodiesel will help us save money on the road and make the bus greener, plus smelling like french fries all the time cant be bad can it? Not only can we use less gas but we can support local bio-diesel makers and local restaurants. Win win. </li>
<li>The generator will help us power the sound systems and air conditioning at night when we aren't near a power source. An electric generator is much more quiet which means we can park almost anywhere and still have a function bus without disturbing every possible neighbor.  We can save a lot of money on lodging by being able to renegade park. We have a generator but we would like to avoid using it as much as 
possible because its loud and burns a lot of gas. </li>
<li>The small budget is for repairs on the road because believe us, they will happen. Big buses have big repairs. The bus is not old and in great shape and has very few miles on it and a Diesel engine. It's far from a money pit but big machines need big repairs and maintenance, it's inevitable. <br/>
</li>
<li>If we don't reach our goal we will use the funds for the most important things first and then work our way down. Every dollar is helpful, no amount is too small. </li>
</ul><p></p><p>Why are we asking for your help?</p><ul>
<li>We are doing this campaign because we think we could do a better of job 
of not impacting the environment so much when we travel. It's a really 
simple fix; solar panels, electric generator, biodiesel conversion, etc.
 The bus is in great shape but making a few adjustments would really 
reduce not only our imprint but our expenses too. <br/>
</li>
<li>The One Love Bus is not a party bus, we don't make any money with the bus and we don't want to. Its not about money its about art and exposure for the artists as well as bridging the gap between the people who want art and music and the people who make it, on a much more obtainable level than what you will find in a gallery. We are doing important work and we need a hand with the costs. <br/>
</li>
<li>Everyone involved is invested in making this work. Everyone is giving everything they have to spread the good word about the One Love Bus and why music and art are so important. A small financial donation from a lot of people will make our trips safer, more comfortable and move available. A little bit goes a long way, help us support the artistic community.

Named
after Ormond Road in Richmond, Surrey, Ormond Opera was
formed in 2015 by Justin Bindley and Rosalind O’Dowd with
a view to presenting staged, costumed opera concerts and full operas with piano
accompaniment. 
The aim
is to mix emerging and experienced artists in a diverse repertoire that will
see us perform operas by Puccini, Sullivan and Verdi amongst many others in the
future. 
Our first
season sees us presenting scenes from five popular operas by Puccini, followed
by a concert of Gilbert & Sullivan. 
Rosalind
O’Dowd – Creative Director
Rosalind has a wide audience
following around the Richmond area, having sung locally over a number of years
for Richmond Choral Society, CantantiCamerati,
Isleworth Baroque, West London Opera, at the Twickenham Festival and in the
concert series Soprano Soprano!,
which recently celebrated its 8th
concert.
Before turning professional,
Rosalind spent 10 years working in marketing for a variety of blue-chip
companies and brings a wealth of business experience to this new musical
venture. 
Justin
Bindley – Musical Director
Justin is a highly experienced
musician with a career spanning over 20 years. Alongside his
singing career he has pursued a long standing singing and coaching practise ,
and also his first love in music –  conducting and musical direction. He
has formed and managed various opera groups over the years.  In 2013 he was appointed Music
Director of the Salveo Singers, a department of Health
choir, which he ran until 2014.Plans for 2015-16
Ormond is planning for the long
term.  It aims to build up a successful
following through popular concerts, which can be replicated across the UK and beyond.

Not to mention costumes, transport, sets, lighting, back stage team etc etc.....   The Impact 
'Music expresses that which cannot be said and on which it is
impossible to be silent.'  
Victor HugoNot only will Ormond Opera give pleasure and enjoyment to audiences, but it will give the artists involved invaluable experience for their ongoing careers.  Rosalind O'Dowd, Creative Director, says 'I was very grateful in the early days of my career to experience being part of some fabulous operas, and I hope to give that opportunity to others.' We want people to be excited by opera, and give them access to it in venues near where they are.
Challenges

 In setting up an opera company, the challenges begin immediately.  The set up costs are high (we have a long shopping list!) and the success of the company will be, in large part, whether we can find a critical mass of audience members who will pay to watch us perform, time and time again.
However, in starting in Richmond, where some of the current Ormond Opera artists are already well known, it is hoped that enough audience members will attend, to give us a fantastic start.  It is with your help in donating that it will really take the pressure off worrying about whether our first concert will result in profit or loss, so we can concentrate on delivering top class music.

Unbeknownst to me, at that time, that music would help me transform myself, my soul and touch countless lives young and old. This evolution has given way to so many opportunities to make the world just a bit brighter, more soulful and harmonious. This campaign is a culmination of my many years of learning music, performing and teaching to prepare me to disseminate my craft in an elevating work for you and others to enjoy. ""Elevation"" is my first full length debut album, featuring some of today's best and brightest contemporary artists. With friends and respected colleagues, I have been graced to have recorded this album which features nearly all original tunes and compositions written by me. As well, these tunes are masterfully executed by the likes of Eric Reed, John Beasley, Ben Williams, Ben Shepherd, Jonathan Pinson, Sam Barsh, Nick Mancini, Jesse Palter, &amp; Michael Mayo. We are truly excited to have you become a part in the phenomenal production. We believe it will be one of the best new albums to date!</span></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">As some of you may know, the recording industry has made many changes that affect how artists are published and managed. The digital age has enabled instantaneous downloads nearly anywhere, anytime. Thus, this campaign will help Elevation succeed in not only it's rendered form, but to be promoted nationally and globally to appreciative and discerning music enthusiasts. Your contribution will help insure that this music is professionally mixed mastered edited, published and also printing of CD's, cover art, promoted and even toured. Money will be utilized for the costs of the post production as mentioned, distribution and video promotion as well as marketing to expand its reach through radio and other distribution channels. This is a well thought plan that enables us to take our destiny in our own hands. I am fortunate to have the support of mentors and industry execs alike all interested in leveraging what we are creating and if you have read this far, we know you are like minded and value the arts as we do. We are planning some amazing perks that will put you front and center with this new classic! Our best foot has been placed forward and you can help us in this next step!

<p style=""margin: 20px; padding: 0px;""><span>25-year-old Danny Janklow is quickly gaining international recognition for his soulful and innovative musical voice. His heart-felt, passionate, and highly energetic music has reached and inspired thousands of listeners from Japan to Holland to Mexico. His live performances, often described as ""emotionally charged"" and ""vibrant celebrations,"" leave his listeners always wanting more...  <br style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px;""/></span></p>
<p style=""margin: 20px; padding: 0px;""><span>Born in Tarzana, CA in 1989, Danny Janklow was handed the saxophone at the age of 11. His life would soon change as he was introduced to the remarkable sounds of Charlie Parker, Cannonball Adderley, and John Coltrane. Just 2 years later, it was obvious to all that the music had chosen him. During his time at Agoura High School, Danny was recognized by Wynton Marsalis and the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra as the first-ever triple instrument ""Outstanding Soloist"" on tenor saxophone, flute and clarinet.</span><span><br/></span></p>
<p style=""margin: 20px; padding: 0px;""><span>In 2007, Danny was awarded a full-tuition scholarship to Philadelphia's Temple University Boyer College of Music and Dance where he was mentored by saxophone legend Dick Oatts and incredible trumpeter Terell Stafford. In 2010, Danny won 1st place in the North American Saxophone Alliance competition held in Athens, Georgia. While living on the east coast, he frequently played at the Village Vanguard with the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra, the Kimmel Center, the Apollo in Harlem, and Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola in New York.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 20px; padding: 0px;""><span>After graduating in 2011, Danny moved back to Los Angeles to take the scene by storm. He rapidly became one of LA's most in-demand saxophonists and bandleaders. In August 2012, he won 1st place at the Detroit Jazz Festival Saxophone Competition and headlined on that year's festival. He took part in a 2-year Mentor program teaching at Stanford Jazz Camp where he discovered his deep passion for teaching students of all ages.

</div>","""Elevation"" Danny Janklow's 1st Full Length AlbumMy journey with music began when I was first handed a saxophone by my middle school band teacher. Unbeknownst to me, at that time, that music would help me transform myself, my soul and touch countless lives young and old. This evolution has given way to so many opportunities to make the world just a bit brighter, more soulful and harmonious. This campaign is a culmination of my many years of learning music, performing and teaching to prepare me to disseminate my craft in an elevating work for you and others to enjoy. ""Elevation"" is my first full length debut album, featuring some of today's best and brightest contemporary artists. With friends and respected colleagues, I have been graced to have recorded this album which features nearly all original tunes and compositions written by me. As well, these tunes are masterfully executed by the likes of Eric Reed, John Beasley, Ben Williams, Ben Shepherd, Jonathan Pinson, Sam Barsh, Nick Mancini, Jesse Palter, & Michael Mayo. We are truly excited to have you become a part in the phenomenal production. We believe it will be one of the best new albums to date!

As some of you may know, the recording industry has made many changes that affect how artists are published and managed. The digital age has enabled instantaneous downloads nearly anywhere, anytime. Thus, this campaign will help Elevation succeed in not only it's rendered form, but to be promoted nationally and globally to appreciative and discerning music enthusiasts. Your contribution will help insure that this music is professionally mixed mastered edited, published and also printing of CD's, cover art, promoted and even toured. Money will be utilized for the costs of the post production as mentioned, distribution and video promotion as well as marketing to expand its reach through radio and other distribution channels. This is a well thought plan that enables us to take our destiny in our own hands. I am fortunate to have the support of mentors and industry execs alike all interested in leveraging what we are creating and if you have read this far, we know you are like minded and value the arts as we do. We are planning some amazing perks that will put you front and center with this new classic! Our best foot has been placed forward and you can help us in this next step! Make a contribution of $5, $20, $100, $2000 every dime brings this project to a new level! 

More ways to help! we welcome you sharing this link, promoting our webpage as well as utilizing the indigo go share tools available to get the word out. Thank you again for your contribution in whatever form it takes, may you be elevated for your kindness.
Danny Janklow - Saxophonist/Composer 

25-year-old Danny Janklow is quickly gaining international recognition for his soulful and innovative musical voice. His heart-felt, passionate, and highly energetic music has reached and inspired thousands of listeners from Japan to Holland to Mexico. His live performances, often described as ""emotionally charged"" and ""vibrant celebrations,"" leave his listeners always wanting more...  
Born in Tarzana, CA in 1989, Danny Janklow was handed the saxophone at the age of 11. His life would soon change as he was introduced to the remarkable sounds of Charlie Parker, Cannonball Adderley, and John Coltrane. Just 2 years later, it was obvious to all that the music had chosen him. During his time at Agoura High School, Danny was recognized by Wynton Marsalis and the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra as the first-ever triple instrument ""Outstanding Soloist"" on tenor saxophone, flute and clarinet.
In 2007, Danny was awarded a full-tuition scholarship to Philadelphia's Temple University Boyer College of Music and Dance where he was mentored by saxophone legend Dick Oatts and incredible trumpeter Terell Stafford. In 2010, Danny won 1st place in the North American Saxophone Alliance competition held in Athens, Georgia. While living on the east coast, he frequently played at the Village Vanguard with the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra, the Kimmel Center, the Apollo in Harlem, and Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola in New York.
After graduating in 2011, Danny moved back to Los Angeles to take the scene by storm. He rapidly became one of LA's most in-demand saxophonists and bandleaders. In August 2012, he won 1st place at the Detroit Jazz Festival Saxophone Competition and headlined on that year's festival. He took part in a 2-year Mentor program teaching at Stanford Jazz Camp where he discovered his deep passion for teaching students of all ages. In 2013, he was selectively chosen as a semi-finalist to compete in the Thelonious Monk International Saxophone Competition in Washington D.C.
Danny has enjoyed the pleasure of sharing the stage and recording with the likes of Wynton and Branford Marsalis, Benny Golson, Terell Stafford, Wycliffe Gordon, Eric Reed, John Beasley, Ben Williams, Jason Moran, Savion Glover, Vanguard Jazz Orchestra, Bill Holman Big Band, Gordon Goodwin, Barbara Morrison and Jimmy Heath.
The ""Elevation""  album is a true celebration of passionate, soulful, and beautiful music. This is Danny's feature length album debut! Aside from a cover of Radiohead's ""Creep,"" the album features Danny's original music written over the span of 6 years. Danny was honored to be joined by the most incredible musicians he knew to play on this remarkable studio session.The result was a complete masterful performance by everyone.

<i>Don't you(,) mean people? is a post-rock band from Thunder Bay Ontario and have been around since 2011. Since then these three
 gentlemen have released one six track album titled ""EP!!"" which won 
best Thunder Bay album of 2013. They have also released a demo 
entitled ""Comfy onion"" which is a teaser for their first full-length 
""Who cares?"" to be released in the fall of 2015.</i><br/><br/>""Who cares?"" is going to play an important role as our first full length album. We are planning to take this album across the country and we need your help to make it happen. A band's first full length sets a standard which that band will always be compared to, and we believe that ""Who cares?"" is a perfect example of a first album gone right.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We are looking to raise $4,500 to cover our expenses for the production of the physical albums. We are producing 12"" vinyl records and custom flash drives.  The records will come with our 9 track album and one digital-only bonus track.</p>
<p>We are also offering up other things not related specifically to the album including private concerts and play-through videos!</p>
<p>If we don't meet our goal, don't worry! You will still receive the perk that you paid for. But to help reach our goal please share this crowdfunding campaign on your social media such as facebook, twitter, instagram, arts and culture mags, news media, music blogs, and by good old fashioned word-of-mouth.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Any band's first full-length record is a big deal! The rest of a band's career relies on it. So far we have produced an EP which won Thunder Bay's best album in 2013. We are very proud of our previous work, but we guarantee that this record is our best work yet! We know that this record is going to make a splash in Canada's national music scene as well as the international math-rock/post-rock scene. Be an early supporter, you'll earn bragging rights!<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Recording a studio album is EXPENSIVE! We have already exhausted our individual savings accounts paying for the recording, mixing and mastering of our songs. But it's entirely worth it; the record sounds great! We are prepared to produce this entire project ourselves, but with your help we can move forward with the physical production AND pay our bills on time.<br/> </p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you're as broke as us or if you want to buy a record from us personally when we go on tour in the fall, make some noise on the internet, scream about it in the street and talk proactively about it at quaint social gatherings. <br/></p>
<p>We need to get the word out about our record to as many people as possible. If you know of any arts and culture magazines/websites/blogs etc. that have an audience which is receptive to our type of music send us a message or help us get in contact with them!

<p>This year we want to take the festival to the next level, and have booked some great headliners and attractions to increase attendance and hopefully generate a larger profit.  The profits from the event this year and for years in the future will fund the Tiffin Music and Art Festival Scholarship program, which will award a $500 scholarship to at least two Tiffin high school seniors who will be pursuing further education in the performing or visual arts.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>What we need is help raising the remaining amount of expenses for the festival that this years sponsorships have not covered.  The operating expenses for this years festival are projected around $22,000.  To date we've been able to secure donations and sponsorships to cover around $6,000 of the cost, but we are seeking to raise the remaining difference so we can ensure that all profits from the event can fund the scholarship campaign.  We are asking for slightly over the difference to account for the potential 18% fee we can face if your goal is not met.</p>
<p>In exchange for your financial contribution, we are offering a number of packages that reward you with some Tiffin Music and Art Festival swag, or a VIP experience at this years festival.  </p>

<p>This year we introduced our Tiffin Music and Art Festival Scholarship program, which awards at least two $500 scholarships to area high school seniors pursuing further education in the performing or visual arts from both Tiffin Columbian and Tiffin Calvert high schools in Tiffin, Ohio.  </p>
<p>We believe in paying it forward, and hope that by helping area students to gain the knowledge they seek, they will come back and help with the festival and raise awareness for music and arts in the greater Tiffin community.  </p>
<p>Simply put, the more profit we have at the end of the festival, the more students we can help out, with larger and more awards.  </p>
<p>If enough of a profit exists we also want to establish a fund that will provide a cushion should future festivals have inclement weather or other mitigating circumstances, so that we can consistently provide impact to graduating high school seniors year in and year out.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The risks and challenges we have faced in the past are weather, promotion, and attendance.  Weather wise we plan on having a sufficient number of tents, as well as covered stages so that the festival can go on rain or shine.  Promotion wise we have considerably stepped up where we are advertising the event this year.  Attendance wise we are more than confident that our line up will bring a large crowd and give us a raise in attendance over last years plateau.</p>
<p>The new risk and challenge is with adding more attractions and headliners, our cost has nearly doubled compared to years prior.  We are hoping to overcome this increase by fundraising via this campaign, as well as getting in touch with more companies about sponsorships.  We've also decided to incorporate a minimum donation to get into the beer garden area.  This will help to ensure that we raise enough money to not only cover our costs, but be able to provide great scholarships, and possibly establish a fund that will offer some cushion for future festivals and scholarships.</p>

<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>Hey guys, Keith Kenny here.  I've been performing my ""one-man-rock band""  show around the country for the past 12 years and for the first time ever I had an opportunity to record my songs with Producer / Engineer Justin Guip.  Justin is currently the drummer for Hot Tuna and has won three Grammy Awards as Sound Engineer for Levon Helm on his last three studio albums.  Having his ear on my songs was an honor and his influence during the recording process really brought the project to the next level for me.  The album is an eclectic mix of ten original songs deeply rooted in guitar and banjo riffs, foot stomping percussion, and vocal melody hooks.   I truly believe that it covers the gamut of musical influences I've had throughout my life digging into rock, blues, folk &amp; heavy metal.  I think it's the best work I have put forth to date.  With this great opportunity came some hefty expenses that I am hoping to raise here so that I can give this album the proper release that it deserves.  I have also been working with a 3D printing design team to make the perks of this campaign extremely unique and special for everyone who is willing to contribute.  Thank you for taking the time to read this and I am so grateful for your support.  </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The nature of the music business today has left a lot of hardworking musicians to fend for themselves because there are less record labels willing to invest in upcoming artists.  In a way this new model allows for us to connect with our fans in a more direct way and keep our creative freedom without being manipulated by record executives.  Your contribution is the support that makes the music possible.  Every dollar goes right back into making more music!   </p>

The Impact
The nature of the music business today has left a lot of hardworking musicians to fend for themselves because there are less record labels willing to invest in upcoming artists.  In a way this new model allows for us to connect with our fans in a more direct way and keep our creative freedom without being manipulated by record executives.  Your contribution is the support that makes the music possible.  Every dollar goes right back into making more music!

<div> After returning from World War II, where he served with his bagpipes in tow, John Rosenberger, along with his father, Karl Rosenberger, founded the Cameron Highlanders Pipe Band of San Diego, California in 1946.  The band is now the oldest bagpipe band in the Western United States.  The band's early uniform was inspired by and modeled after the British army regiment, The Queen's Own Highlanders, and wore the modern Cameron tartan.  Her majesty Queen Elizabeth officially recognized the Cameron Highlanders Pipe Band in the 1950s.  Our bands now wear the Ancient Cameron of Eracht tartan.</div>

Pipe Major Charlie Rosenberger (front and center) leads the  Camerons  into competition.
Who We AreThe Cameron Highlanders Pipe Band is not only among the most successful and oldest Highland bagpipe bands in the United States, we are also a top competitor in the US and are the 2016 United States Mid-Western Champions, and the 2015 Western United States Pipe Band Champions in Grade 3 and 4.  In addition to competitions, our organization has been giving free piping and drumming lessons to interested players of all ages since the band's founding in 1946.  As a 501(c)(3) educational organization, we have a strong commitment to the preservation and growth of the art of the Highland Bagpipes and the unique drumming styles associated with this music.  Many of our students have gone on to become nationally and internationally recognized champion piper and drummers.  




Our Campaign Purpose
To mark the 70th anniversary of our founding, the Cameron Highlanders Bagpipe Band of San Diego is competing at the 2016 World Pipe Band Championships this August in Glasgow, Scotland.  It is our honor to represent the USA, California, and the beautiful city of San Diego before a worldwide audience.  This is our chance to show off the results of the many hours of hard work and dedication we have put into playing this beautiful and complex music well.   
We are excited to field bands in two competition classes this year, grades 3 and 4a, but we need your help.  Transporting all of the band members, instruments, uniforms and other equipment overseas is a complex and costly undertaking.  Your generous donation is needed to make this possible for all of our musicians to be able to attend this exciting adventure at the ""Worlds"", and since we are a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, your donation is tax deductible, too!

For many of the younger members of the band, this trip offers additional opportunity as most of them make their first trip outside of our own country into a wider world.  This is a chance for them to develop stronger skills of teamwork, responsibility and personal excellence, while gaining self-confidence and the friendship and camaraderie that accompanies meeting others and competing in a shared sense of purpose.

History of the Cameron Highlanders Pipe Band
 After returning from World War II, where he served with his bagpipes in tow, John Rosenberger, along with his father, Karl Rosenberger, founded the Cameron Highlanders Pipe Band of San Diego, California in 1946.  The band is now the oldest bagpipe band in the Western United States.  The band's early uniform was inspired by and modeled after the British army regiment, The Queen's Own Highlanders, and wore the modern Cameron tartan.  Her majesty Queen Elizabeth officially recognized the Cameron Highlanders Pipe Band in the 1950s.  Our bands now wear the Ancient Cameron of Eracht tartan.


Founder John Rosenberger (then a private) took his pipes with him into WWII.  He is pictured playing on the 4th of July 1944 in Normandy, France. 


                        
 Founders Karl and John Rosenberger with sons and grandsons                    Charlie and Malcolm Rosenberger. 

Since its birth, the Cameron Highlanders have competed and performed throughout the Western United States, including performances for Prince Charles and Queen Elizabeth, countless community parades and a wide variety of local performances at churches, Scottish and Irish festivals, private shows and the band's own annual Tartan Ball.  The band is now led by Pipe Major Charles Rosenberger, the son and grandson of the founders; our drum corps is led by Drum Sergeant Aaron Mars, a lifelong member of the band.

 The History of the Bagpipes

the Scottish Great Highland bagpipes have the greatest visibility
with the English speaking world, bagpipes have been played for
centuries in many countries and several different forms and continue to be played throughout large parts of the world today.  For an excellent explanation of bagpipes and their history please view this page:  Wikipedia.org Bagpipes",36.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Who is Phil Marshall and What is Scatterbed?</h3>
<p>I’ve been playing guitar, or at least trying, since the day my mother bought a Yamaha FG-180 <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">for my sister and me back in the fall of ’69.  When I was 19 I met Chuck “Colorblind James” </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Cuminale and within 48 hours we played our first gig with Thaddeus Iorizzo on doghouse bass.  </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">In 1980 we moved out to San Francisco and formed what eventually became The Colorblind </span><span>James Experience.  </span></p>
<p>During my tenure with the band, we put out the self-titled album followed by “Why Should I <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Stand Up?” “Strange Sounds From The Basement” (as the Death Valley Boys) and “Solid! Behind </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The Times”.  It was through my close association with Chuck that I began to figure out how to </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">put a song together. Eventually I left the Experience and formed my own band, Lalaland.  </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Lalaland released “Nude”, my first CD of original songs. </span></p>
<p>Over the years I’ve also had the great pleasure of being asked to contribute guitar to the <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">recordings of Annie Wells, Woody Dodge, Connie Deming and others.  I also played guitar and </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">penned a couple of songs on SLT’s “Gone Dead Gone” CD.  Soon to be released is the new CD by </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Annie Wells which features her own arrangements of <i>Home Sweet Home</i> and <i>Nothing Left To </i></span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><i>Lose</i>.  </span></p>

<p>I’m looking forward to releasing this latest batch of songs entitled “Scatterbed”.  Scatterbed <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">reflects 2 years of working closely with Chris Zajkowski.  During that time our association </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">blossomed into a true friendship.  As the album developed, it went off in a direction I had not </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">anticipated.  What I had intended to be a casual, 60s tinged pop CD became a more acoustic </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">based reflection on loss, grief, faith and the lack thereof.  </span></p>
<p>Through Chris’ support and encouragement, I felt open to explore themes and feelings dark and <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">painful as well as humorous and hopeful.  Watching the songs grow and go off in unexpected </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">directions was thrilling.  The themes are all there in the titles such as <i>Grief Walks In</i>, <i>Here’s </i></span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><i>Hoping</i>, <i>Faith</i> and <i>Heaven Is Waiting</i>.  <i>Ebb and Flow</i>, <i>Marmalade</i>, <i>Black Ice</i> and <i>Wrapped In a </i></span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><i>Comet’s Tail </i>deal with depression, family, friends and loss.  <i>Home Sweet Home</i> is a humorous </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">play on nursery rhymes that questions what lies behind the veil of domestic bliss while <i>Shirley </i></span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><i>Jane</i> imagines a scenario played out by the artwork in my living room!</span></p>
<p>I felt so fortunate to be able to receive the instrumental contributions of Ken Frank, Peter Miller <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">and Mark, Scott, and Todd Bradley.  Chris, acting as producer as well as sideman, played drums, </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">keyboard, upright bass, and glockenspiel and sang background vocals.  He is also receiving </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">songwriting credit for his invaluable contributions lyrically and musically to two songs.  Thank </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">you, Chris! </span></p>
<p>I’ve felt a great deal of support from the music community in Rochester, NY even during my <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">sometimes lengthy absences from live performances.  My hope is to put out a CD worthy of </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">your time, money, and attention.  Here’s hoping we can make this happen together!</span></p>
<h3>What People are Saying About Scatterbed</h3>
</div><div></div><p>""Scatterbed is a multifaceted masterpiece, a brilliant, deeply personal musical/lyrical kaleidoscope."" ~Ken Frank, Songsmith, Musician, Producer</p><div>
<p>""It feels like [he is] singing it just for me""~Maureen McFee, Music Fan</p>
<p>""[T]he highest compliment that I can pay here is that I really can’t compare this to anything else; it’s a new category. And I want to hear it again and again... . It’s great songwriting and musicianship and I hope it finds its way to many ears. [Phil has] pursued a really distinct path here, and there’s beauty. Real, complex, beauty. ""~David McIntire, Composer, Musician, Producer</p>
<p><span>""Phil’s compositions are locked into a deceptive ease. ""~Scott Regan, Open Tunings (WRUR)/Watkins &amp; the Rapiers</span></p>
<p>""Like that song you hear and love the very first time, it is new yet old, deep yet simple, dark yet lovely, universal yet personal, familiar yet completely original.""~Brian Shafer, Musician (Nod/Fox Sisters)</p>
<p></p>

</div></div>","Who is Phil Marshall and What is Scatterbed?
I’ve been playing guitar, or at least trying, since the day my mother bought a Yamaha FG-180 for my sister and me back in the fall of ’69.  When I was 19 I met Chuck “Colorblind James” Cuminale and within 48 hours we played our first gig with Thaddeus Iorizzo on doghouse bass.  In 1980 we moved out to San Francisco and formed what eventually became The Colorblind James Experience.  
During my tenure with the band, we put out the self-titled album followed by “Why Should I Stand Up?” “Strange Sounds From The Basement” (as the Death Valley Boys) and “Solid! Behind The Times”.  It was through my close association with Chuck that I began to figure out how to put a song together. Eventually I left the Experience and formed my own band, Lalaland.  Lalaland released “Nude”, my first CD of original songs. 
Over the years I’ve also had the great pleasure of being asked to contribute guitar to the recordings of Annie Wells, Woody Dodge, Connie Deming and others.  I also played guitar and penned a couple of songs on SLT’s “Gone Dead Gone” CD.  Soon to be released is the new CD by Annie Wells which features her own arrangements of Home Sweet Home and Nothing Left To Lose.  


I’m looking forward to releasing this latest batch of songs entitled “Scatterbed”.  Scatterbed reflects 2 years of working closely with Chris Zajkowski.  During that time our association blossomed into a true friendship.  As the album developed, it went off in a direction I had not anticipated.  What I had intended to be a casual, 60s tinged pop CD became a more acoustic based reflection on loss, grief, faith and the lack thereof.  
Through Chris’ support and encouragement, I felt open to explore themes and feelings dark and painful as well as humorous and hopeful.  Watching the songs grow and go off in unexpected directions was thrilling.  The themes are all there in the titles such as Grief Walks In, Here’s Hoping, Faith and Heaven Is Waiting.  Ebb and Flow, Marmalade, Black Ice and Wrapped In a Comet’s Tail deal with depression, family, friends and loss.  Home Sweet Home is a humorous play on nursery rhymes that questions what lies behind the veil of domestic bliss while Shirley Jane imagines a scenario played out by the artwork in my living room!
I felt so fortunate to be able to receive the instrumental contributions of Ken Frank, Peter Miller and Mark, Scott, and Todd Bradley.  Chris, acting as producer as well as sideman, played drums, keyboard, upright bass, and glockenspiel and sang background vocals.  He is also receiving songwriting credit for his invaluable contributions lyrically and musically to two songs.  Thank you, Chris! 
I’ve felt a great deal of support from the music community in Rochester, NY even during my sometimes lengthy absences from live performances.  My hope is to put out a CD worthy of your time, money, and attention.  Here’s hoping we can make this happen together!
What People are Saying About Scatterbed
""Scatterbed is a multifaceted masterpiece, a brilliant, deeply personal musical/lyrical kaleidoscope."" ~Ken Frank, Songsmith, Musician, Producer
""It feels like [he is] singing it just for me""~Maureen McFee, Music Fan
""[T]he highest compliment that I can pay here is that I really can’t compare this to anything else; it’s a new category. And I want to hear it again and again... . It’s great songwriting and musicianship and I hope it finds its way to many ears. [Phil has] pursued a really distinct path here, and there’s beauty. Real, complex, beauty. ""~David McIntire, Composer, Musician, Producer
""Phil’s compositions are locked into a deceptive ease. ""~Scott Regan, Open Tunings (WRUR)/Watkins & the Rapiers
""Like that song you hear and love the very first time, it is new yet old, deep yet simple, dark yet lovely, universal yet personal, familiar yet completely original.""~Brian Shafer, Musician (Nod/Fox Sisters)

Why $5,000?

Because it'll cost about that much to produce, distribute, and promote the CD.
Here's the breakdown:



Manufacturing/Packaging: $1,500.00 


Final Mastering: $1,500.00 


Distribution: $700.00 


Promotional Materials: $300.00


Website/Advertising: $350.00

<p>Hi there, I’m Riley McKinnon and this is my Indiegogo campaign. There are two main things
I want to accomplish with this campaign:</p>
<p>1.<span>  </span>It’s been 8 years since I recorded my
last album and I’m working on my new one. I want to record and promote my new
EP or album. </p>
<p>2.<span>  </span>This will help me gain momentum with
my business and turn my passion of song into a full time career.</p>
<p>So I am
hoping you will help me accomplish this by supporting my musical art through
this Indiegogo campaign! Check out the “Perks” to see the different ways you
can contribute.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>The Concept</b></p>
<p>I’ve decided
to call the album <b>“Visceral
Transitions”.</b> I rediscovered this word Visceral recently and I really love
the sound of it and its meaning.  When I
read the definition I instantly thought it would be the perfect title.</p>
<p>I’ve been
attempting to let the music to flow from (or maybe even through me) when I’m
writing a new song. Even just singing whatever comes to me while recording it
quickly and then trying not to sway too far from what I just created.</p>
<p>The
definition of Visceral I’m referring to is; <i>Relating to deep inward feelings rather
than to the intellect.</i></p>
<p>So in essence, I’m attempting to let the
feeling come through the song  and not
let my intellect take over and change it all because I think it needs to sound
like the latest trend in music.</p>
<p>But for me this could mean different
things at different times, and also different styles of music. It could also
include something that just happens to sound ""trendy"" as well.</p>
<p>The main genre will be Rock Alternative
but there will definitely be some hints of other genres seeping through because
I love many styles of music. (Folk, Pop, Electronic, Country, RnB, Hip Hop…)</p>
<p><b>EP</b>-There are 5 or 6 songs I will have
recorded for sure for an EP, even if this campaign doesn’t reach the $5000 mark
I will get this done!</p>
<p><b>Album</b>-I have about twelve or thirteen songs that
I have chosen to be on the album if we can go beyond the $5000. So that will
take a good two or three months to finish.</p>
<p>I do all of the instrumentation singing
recording and mixing. This is not to say that I won’t eventually work with a
producer and other musicians for a future album.  But for now I’m keeping things truly independent.</p>
<p>(I also record and edit all of my videos, at least for now.  I actually enjoy the process)</p><p><b>The First Goal-EP</b></p>
<p>So my initial goal is to raise $5,000 and
this will be going towards the costs associated with the recording production
and promotion of my new EP which includes many things:</p>
<p>1.<span>  </span>Afford me more valuable time to record and produce the EP to
the best of my abilities. I currently have a full time job, as I almost always
have, and I am hoping to transition into music full time finally!</p>
<p>2.<span>  </span>Promotion and advertising. I’ve been educating myself on marketing
and promotion for quite a few years now, but I’ve rarely had the money left
over to really put what I’ve learned into action. So now with about 25 percent
of the money raised I will be implementing different strategies to gain more
exposure for my music career and business. </p>

ZZ Top to My Bloody Valentine.  About two years ago I sold the rights to my name to another company, and now I'm back with a new-from-the-ground-up fuzz design called the Heart Mother.  I'm also available to do custom work and will be building my classic designs under new names.</p>
<p>I was on track to getting my new guitar pedal company, Fuzz Goddess, off the ground over the next two months, but my main investor bailed under extremely bad circumstances, and the company that I sold devi ever : fx too scaled back on production leaving me with practically no income from them.</p>
<p>The Heart Mother fuzz design is done, as well as the PCB, designed by Infanem, my long time friend who has done the incredible engineering work of the Silver Rose, Console, as well as the updated editions of the Circuit Breaker and Improbability Drive.</p>
<p>I have most of the equipment and space and time to start building guitar pedals.  I just need parts, which is why I am creating this campaign, to help get the word out that I am building pedals again, and to offer them for pre-order so I can get things moving.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>It's simple really.  I am offering the new Heart Mother fuzz, along with my older two knob designs, rebranded, and custom work within the technical abilities I am capable of.  You let me know what you want, and I will make it for you.  I'm offering custom graphics as well on all of these, using my standard vinyl sticker paper, so full color art is 100% doable.</p>
<p>Below is a list of the pedals along with demo's of what they sound like.  Once again, I can also build whatever custom effect you would like as well, as long as it's within my capabilities.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>With my royalties from the sell of my business practically cut off, and my single investor bailing on me, I am quite literally at the end of my rope.  If I can't get the ball rolling on Fuzz Goddess and get the word out about building pedals again, I will be homeless, which wouldn't be so bad to be honest... I would figure out a way to survive, but I have three cats that need a place to live... and there's no reason why I shouldn't be able to get a sustainable income happening from building pedals other than I don't have the starting capital.</p>
<p>The impact is you would be saving me and my cat's lives.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The biggest risk is that if I don't sell enough pedals and can sustain consistent sales over the course of the next few months, I'll still be in a position of having to find a place to live which would invariably delay my ability to continue to build pedals.</p>
<p>I also have a lot of debt I need to pay off, which I have been over time, including an old failed kickstarter which is about half way paid off.  Those are part of the reasons my monthly living expenses are as high as they are (areound $2.5k a month).</p>
<p>The thing is, I have interest from a UK distributor, and I am working with Pedaltronics (who has helped with Frantone and BJFE) to get more of my pedals into production, so things ARE moving forward... but without forward capital, I'll be homeless before I am off the ground.</p>
<p>Once I am off the ground though, my old brand was making well over $10k a month, even on a slow month... and I have no doubt I will get there with Fuzz Goddess.  It's only a matter of time, money to start production again, and getting the word out.</p>
<p>The final challenge and risk is that ordering parts and producing these pedals will take time.  Waiting for orders to come in and then buying parts in bulk can takes weeks, and then sorting out production on top of that, turn around with these first batch of pedals might be a month and a half or longer, and if only a few people buy pedals, then once again that still leaves me homeless and will make it hard to fulfill orders.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>I need people to know that I am no longer associated with the devi ever : fx brand and that Fuzz Goddess is now where I am creating effects.</p>
<p>I need retail and distributor support in the long term.</p>
<p>I need a place to live and work if this all fails.</p>
</div></div>","Short Summary For a decade I built and designed fuzz pedals under the Effector 13 and devi ever : fx moniker.  I've built pedals for everyone from Depeche Mode to Nine Inch Nails.... ZZ Top to My Bloody Valentine.  About two years ago I sold the rights to my name to another company, and now I'm back with a new-from-the-ground-up fuzz design called the Heart Mother.  I'm also available to do custom work and will be building my classic designs under new names.
I was on track to getting my new guitar pedal company, Fuzz Goddess, off the ground over the next two months, but my main investor bailed under extremely bad circumstances, and the company that I sold devi ever : fx too scaled back on production leaving me with practically no income from them.
The Heart Mother fuzz design is done, as well as the PCB, designed by Infanem, my long time friend who has done the incredible engineering work of the Silver Rose, Console, as well as the updated editions of the Circuit Breaker and Improbability Drive.
I have most of the equipment and space and time to start building guitar pedals.  I just need parts, which is why I am creating this campaign, to help get the word out that I am building pedals again, and to offer them for pre-order so I can get things moving.   What We Need & What You Get It's simple really.  I am offering the new Heart Mother fuzz, along with my older two knob designs, rebranded, and custom work within the technical abilities I am capable of.  You let me know what you want, and I will make it for you.  I'm offering custom graphics as well on all of these, using my standard vinyl sticker paper, so full color art is 100% doable.
Below is a list of the pedals along with demo's of what they sound like.  Once again, I can also build whatever custom effect you would like as well, as long as it's within my capabilities.

</div><p>Here’s the big idea: 
The people of the Central San Joaquin Valley rally behind a local band
every six months.  The band gets their
first album recorded and some CD’s pressed, plus some other stuff.  Bands feel supported by their community.  Bands get a boost in their career and their
development.  Some of the bands will continue
to grow and hopefully a few will hit it pretty big. When they accept their
first Grammy award they can honestly say, “We couldn’t have done this without
the support of our community.”</p>
<p>The first band we’ve selected is The Red Coats.  They are super talented and hardworking,
incredibly sincere and have developed an authentic sound.  They are the type of band that you (and we)
can feel good about supporting.  They’ve
already invested their own money into recording their first album and now we
can help them to get it finished more quickly.</p><p>The first time we saw them perform was last year at the Sudz in the City microbrew festival.  They started playing and we stopped to listen.  We noticed that everyone else stopped what they were doing too.  Everyone turned and listened and smiled. Everyone moved closer to the stage.  That's the kind of reaction they get every time they play.</p>
<p>Croptown Creative is a new marketing company which works
exclusively with locally-owned enterprises from the Central San Joaquin
Valley.  We will select a band, twice a
year, through our affiliated downtown pub, Peeve’s Public House.  We hope that lots of bands will want your
support and that you will want to support many of our local bands.  We can do this!</p>
<p>If this campaign is fully funded, The Red Coats will have:</p>

The sole purpose is to fund a music video for our single ""Come Alive"", off our latest EP Restless available every where online November 24 2015. I'm Jason and I am the lead singer and main song writer of LULLABY CRASH. We are a Alternative rock band from Cincinnati Ohio that has been together for a little over a year now. I have had the greatest privilege to work with the super group of musicians we have put together for LULLABY CRASH. Mike, Kevin, Matt and myself have been playing in bands our whole lives. We have all been through bad record deals, vans breaking down and every band problem imaginable.  When we set out to become LULLABY CRASH we had the idea to take our music to the top and give the music business one heck of a ride. But, we need your HELP! Record labels aren't looking to sign starter bands, they want polished projects ready to release music and tour now. We have spent every last dollar into the recording our latest EP and now are trying to push our first single with as much power behind it as possible. That's where you, the donor can help. All funds raised through this campaign go to the production and tools needed to create a successful music video.  Add us on Facebook and get linked in to everything the band is doing!</p>

To get our band to the next level we need any contribution possible towards the music video.

We became extremely persistent and we ended up getting some of our music in some pretty big movies, with some pretty big artists. I then realized this opportunity was rare and very difficult to come by. Like other music producers, when the opportunity presented its self we didn't have enough music. With that said, we missed out on several opportunities including money.

<p>In our age of restless music consumption, what are the albums you hold closest to your heart?

With <i>Isn’t That Anyone</i>, we’re hoping to add another album to your list.</p>
<p><i>Isn’t That Anyone</i> is an ambitious leap for Eternals. Recorded throughout 2015 with <b>Aaron Bastenelli</b> at <b>Q Division Studios </b>(Somerville, MA), and <b>Rubber Tracks</b> (Boston/New York), we’ve assembled a group of songs that we hope will be well received as a cohesive unit, while also possessing unique and defining characteristics that help each song stand on its own.</p>
<p><b>Us</b></p>
<p>Eternals is the music of Stephen Konrads, Eric Bolton, Harrison Seiler, and Wayne Whittaker. Our self-titled album, recorded at the Soul Shop in Medford, MA and released in 2014, is a collection of songs that have served as the band’s foundation since its inception. With <i>Isn’t That Anyone</i>, we look to build off of that foundation and present new and exciting ideas which we’ve been working on for much of the past two years.</p>
<p><b>You</b></p>
<p>Self-releasing an album presents countless challenges for independent artists. With your help, we’re looking to press <i>Isn’t That Anyone</i> to vinyl, create band merchandise and subsidize some of the cost of recording, mixing, and mastering the record. 100% of the funds collected during this campaign will go to these efforts. </p>

Made with a soft cotton blend for comfort and durability, yet being fashionable for a multitude of settings. Drawstrings on the sides allow you to tweak how you wear your shirt to fit how you feel and compliment what ever you pair it with.  </span><br/></p>
<p>Tabitha Abney Is a fashion designer currently residing in Columbus, Ohio. Her work extends from couture one offs to forward thinking ready to wear pieces. You can find more about her work at Designs By Tabi/Tamarie LLC.</p>
<p>Ian Powell is an Artist from Columbus, having been a way from the musical limelight for a number of years to focus on other artistic pursuits and figure out how to present his music. Ian has been heavily involved in the Columbus, Ohio Music Community since 2006, From being a song writer and performer to photographing other musicians for promotion and publication.</p>
<p>This really is about lighting fires to get things done. Its a mix of branding and wonderful design. Tying music and fashion together. The Hooded Shirt is a modern play on the Little Red Ridding Hood Mythos, as Ian has been playing with aspects of the Big Bad Wolf both lyrically and visually. Ian first came up with this concept in 2008, and it took a while to find a Fashion designer he really wanted to partner with. Ian and Tabi have refined the idea of the past 2 years with the the pieces finally coming together now with a Limited run of 175 pieces available Fall 2016.</p>
<p>What we are looking for</p>
<p>We are Looking to raise at least $6,000.00 to cover production costs for the Limited Run. Anything raised beyond that through this offer will be split, half going towards Tabi’s Couture collections and half going towards the production of “The Howling Preacherman” an 10 song effort by Ian Powell.</p>
<p>With each shirt you’ll get a copy of the finished album when it is released. We’re giving you 2 options, a digital download or a signed physically copy. Updates on the recording process will be sent to you along with fashion events where Tabi’s designs are being showcased.</p>
<p>Our Most Unique offering is limited to 6 where you’ll get a full photo session photographed by Ian and styled by Tabi, If you select this option and opt to wait for the Shirts release to schedule, we will deliver it at your session. </p>
<p>Other ways you can help</p>
<p>While we’d love you to donate small amounts or preorder this unique Hooded Womens Shirt, there are other ways you can support our projects, If you know of a Boutique Store you think would be perfect to carry a few shirts, have them get in contact with us we’d love to partner with them. You can follow our social media accounts for updates and please use the Indiegogo Share Tools to help get the word out.</p><p></p><p></p></div>","Designed by Tabitha Abney to flatter and accentuate.

Ian and Tabi have refined the idea of the past 2 years with the the pieces finally coming together now with a Limited run of 175 pieces available Fall 2016.
What we are looking for
We are Looking to raise at least $6,000.00 to cover production costs for the Limited Run. Anything raised beyond that through this offer will be split, half going towards Tabi’s Couture collections and half going towards the production of “The Howling Preacherman” an 10 song effort by Ian Powell.
With each shirt you’ll get a copy of the finished album when it is released. We’re giving you 2 options, a digital download or a signed physically copy. Updates on the recording process will be sent to you along with fashion events where Tabi’s designs are being showcased.
Our Most Unique offering is limited to 6 where you’ll get a full photo session photographed by Ian and styled by Tabi, If you select this option and opt to wait for the Shirts release to schedule, we will deliver it at your session. 
Other ways you can help
While we’d love you to donate small amounts or preorder this unique Hooded Womens Shirt, there are other ways you can support our projects, If you know of a Boutique Store you think would be perfect to carry a few shirts, have them get in contact with us we’d love to partner with them. You can follow our social media accounts for updates and please use the Indiegogo Share Tools to help get the word out.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>Dan and his ever-evolving band, Field Tripp,  have stayed active in the Phoenix/Tempe music scene since its inception in 2007....  playing hundreds of shows, touring, and releasing four albums.  Field Tripp has established themselves as one of the best live bands to see in Phoenix and have received several awards and enjoyed status on many best-of lists.<br/>
</div> <p>Working in mental health by day and rock n' roll at night,  Dan has stayed devoted to  his music for many years and has no plans of quitting.  Despite this devotion, Dan and the band have never had the resources to record in a legitimate studio, mostly due to their refusal to use a Super PAC.</p>
<p>Dan has his sights set on Flying Blanket Recording in Mesa, AZ to record with producer/engineer, and living legend,  Bob Hoag.  </p>

</ul> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>Money, money, money...  that thing that musicians don't have.  To be completely honest, the band needs more than the $3,333 it's asking for.  Recording a full length album could easily cost $10,000 - $20,000.  For this project, we feel we need a minimum of 10 days in the studio, which is around $5,000. After that, other costs will include mastering, promotion, distribution of our outstanding perks, merchandise, and a considerable amount of coffee. <br/>
</div>
<div>Frankly, we hate asking for money.  We feel that even the $5,000 for studio time is too much to ask for, so the band has been making bi-weekly field trips to the Plasma Donation Center in an effort to cover the remaining $1,667.</div>
<div>Rest assured that every last cent of every donation will be spent on recording and the subsequent release of the finished product which includes:  studio time, mastering, and CD production.</div>
<div>Perks? Yeah, we got em.  All kinds of perks, great perks, fantastic perks.  Recipe perks, music perks...  For instance, the perk for a $50 donation is Field Tripp's entire discography on compact discs and digital downloads.  This will include a copy of the new album signed by the band and entrance to the album release show.</div>

<p>Susanna Ogata and Ian Watson are joining forces to record the complete <i>Sonatas for Fortepiano and Violin</i> of Beethoven in four installments. By partnering with us on this Indiegogo project <i>–</i><b><a href=""http://www.beethoven-project.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> The Beethoven Project</a></b> <i>–</i> you will help us achieve the<b> final </b>phase of the journey: completing the set of four CDs, <b>Volumes 3 and 4</b>, recorded and produced by the brilliant, three-time Grammy winner, <b><a href=""http://www.jessesbakery.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jesse Lewis</a></b>.</p>
<h4>
<br/>Revolution.  Revelation.</h4>
<p>Beethoven stormed onto the musical stage in Vienna at the turn of the 19th century. His music and persona pushed the existing forms and instruments to their absolute limit. Beethoven would definitely recognize the sight and sound of Susanna’s classical violin and Ian’s fortepiano. By using the instruments for which the music was written, we are able to reveal not only the clarity of Beethoven’s extraordinary musical structure, but also an amazing palette of colors. Our aim is not to polish up relics in a museum, but to recreate the white-hot intensity of the moment they were written and first performed. We have been working hard in our rehearsals and performances to do just that!</p>
<h4><b><br/>Phase One and Two are Complete!</b></h4>
<p>We are so grateful to all who have gotten us this far on our path to completing the whole set of these great works on period instruments! </p>

<p><b>Volume 1 </b>was released in June, 2015 and has received
wonderful reviews from major publications worldwide.   Here are a few notable quotes:</p>
<p><i>""Common wisdom has it that period instruments pack a softer punch than modern ones.  But as these two players show in this highly promising first installment of their Beethoven perusal, temperament is not measured in volume.  Rather, the music's moody outbursts and vivacity come fully alive in elegant readings that are attentive to quicksilver changes in dynamics and articulation.  Their performance of the Sonata No. 4 in A minor is darkly playful, their 'Kreutzer' Sonata brilliant and stormy.""</i><br/></p>
<p><i>- <b>The New York Times</b></i></p>
<p><i>""These are altogether compelling performances, with well-judged tempos (except, perhaps, for the curiously fast account of the 'pattering' second variation from the Kreutzer's middle movement), and the music always vividly characterised.""</i><br/></p>
<p><i>- <b>BBC Music Magazine</b></i></p>
<p><i>""The performances are electrifying – vigorous, sharp and unstoppably energetic. This is an exciting addition to the considerable catalogue of famous recordings of these works""</i><br/></p>
<p><i>- <b>Limelight Magazine</b></i></p>
<p><i>""The fortepiano and violin duo of Ian Watson and Susanna Ogata kickstart their survey of Beethoven’s complete sonatas for that particular combo in virile, dramatic style...The fortepiano here is no fragile museum piece, but a sparring partner with attitude. That same assertiveness informs the remainder of this particular sonata, not least in the lyrical playfulness of the Andante scherzoso. It is paired with the deeper intellectualism of the “Kreutzer” sonata, Op 47, virtuosically delivered.""</i><br/></p>

</div></div>","Last Chance...... to Join Our Team!

Susanna Ogata and Ian Watson are joining forces to record the complete Sonatas for Fortepiano and Violin of Beethoven in four installments. By partnering with us on this Indiegogo project – The Beethoven Project – you will help us achieve the final phase of the journey: completing the set of four CDs, Volumes 3 and 4, recorded and produced by the brilliant, three-time Grammy winner, Jesse Lewis.

Revolution.  Revelation.
Beethoven stormed onto the musical stage in Vienna at the turn of the 19th century. His music and persona pushed the existing forms and instruments to their absolute limit. Beethoven would definitely recognize the sight and sound of Susanna’s classical violin and Ian’s fortepiano. By using the instruments for which the music was written, we are able to reveal not only the clarity of Beethoven’s extraordinary musical structure, but also an amazing palette of colors. Our aim is not to polish up relics in a museum, but to recreate the white-hot intensity of the moment they were written and first performed. We have been working hard in our rehearsals and performances to do just that!
Phase One and Two are Complete!
We are so grateful to all who have gotten us this far on our path to completing the whole set of these great works on period instruments! 


Volume 1 was released in June, 2015 and has received
wonderful reviews from major publications worldwide.   Here are a few notable quotes:
""Common wisdom has it that period instruments pack a softer punch than modern ones.  But as these two players show in this highly promising first installment of their Beethoven perusal, temperament is not measured in volume.  Rather, the music's moody outbursts and vivacity come fully alive in elegant readings that are attentive to quicksilver changes in dynamics and articulation.  Their performance of the Sonata No. 4 in A minor is darkly playful, their 'Kreutzer' Sonata brilliant and stormy.""
- The New York Times
""These are altogether compelling performances, with well-judged tempos (except, perhaps, for the curiously fast account of the 'pattering' second variation from the Kreutzer's middle movement), and the music always vividly characterised.""
- BBC Music Magazine
""The performances are electrifying – vigorous, sharp and unstoppably energetic. This is an exciting addition to the considerable catalogue of famous recordings of these works""
- Limelight Magazine
""The fortepiano and violin duo of Ian Watson and Susanna Ogata kickstart their survey of Beethoven’s complete sonatas for that particular combo in virile, dramatic style...The fortepiano here is no fragile museum piece, but a sparring partner with attitude. That same assertiveness informs the remainder of this particular sonata, not least in the lyrical playfulness of the Andante scherzoso. It is paired with the deeper intellectualism of the “Kreutzer” sonata, Op 47, virtuosically delivered.""
-The Scotsman


Volume 2 is now complete and is due for international release in June, 2016 also on  the CORO label. 
Volumes 3 and 4 – The Final Stage


Our next CD, to be recorded June 5-8, 2016, will feature the fantastic trilogy, Beethoven's Op. 30 set, Sonatas 6, 7, and 8 for Fortepiano and Violin.  These three works are full of color, contrast, and variety, showing Beethoven's growth and sophistication in writing for this genre.  Beethoven makes a brilliant, unique statement with each of these works.

<p>The
North American Soca Monarch will play a large role in showcasing the artists

assisting with the international growth of one of the most dynamic musical art forms in the world.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>the funding needed for the North American Soca Monarch Festival is $350,000.00..here is a list of the expense for the Festival.</p>
<p>1. expense for 16 Artist competing in the main event and 4 up and coming artist for De Next Generation event (Air, Hotel, per dium while in Toronto and a $3,000 artists appearance fee).</p>
<p>2. the 2 month Marketing package for the event will include Online media outlets, 2 major radio stations in the US and Canada, hard copy news paper and magazine in US and Canada, 5,000 hard copy event flyers &amp; posters</p>
<p>3. Venue expense for over 3,000 people, construction of main stage, sound &amp; lighting, back stage accommodations, cost of 100 staff members, etc.</p>
<p>4. event licenses (liquor license, waste management, zoning permits, etc)  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>** Our amazing perks for this most important event will allow our supporters to join us at the event by offering admission passes into the venue the day of the event, free drink tickets, beautiful thank you gift bags along with an artist meet and greet during the festival.

<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>An event like this is so important to the Caribbean culture and growing community in North America.

This most important event will not only assist in marketing the artist involved in the festival but also to the Caribbean/Soca artists world wide that may not be in the festival. This festival will put a spot light on the Caribbean culture for years to come. </p>
<p>My 30 year track record in the music industry and a strong team will help in making this event a stapled event during the Toronto Carnival weekend.

<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The number one obstacle for this festival is obtaining enough funds to make this most important event a reality. An event of this magnitude can be costly making funding the biggest obstacle. Proper funding ensures that all expenses are covered that is vital to ensure a successful event, for example the Marketing Package which in turns helps in ticket sales. </p>
<p>Reaching out for assistance on Indiegogo is a great way for solving this issue. I've always believed that no man or woman is an island and that we need each other sometimes and should not be ashamed to say so. I have also reached out to some major companies in pursue of sponsorship for the event and got 3 replies telling me that they have already sent out their annual sponsorship funds but liked the concept of the festival and would like to speak with me next year.   </p>
<p>I sent out a few feelers in Toronto on social media and got a great response, people wanted to know when tickets would be released. We didn't even market the event yet and got a great buzz in the community. Our Marketing Package will play a major role in the success of this festival and we have put together an impressive package using social media, hard copy news papers/magazines, hard copy flyers/posters, radio adds and co-promotions by all the artists involved in the festival. We are more than ready to dedicate our summer to marketing this event to North America and the globe.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We understand that not everyone may be in the position to contribute to this most important event and believe that we can use people's assistance in getting the word out about this festival to their family and friends. Using and directing people to the Indiegogo share tools can be a great help to our team and the success of this event. Your assistance is greatly appreciated by myself and team NASM (North American Soca Monarch).</p>

Following in his Father’s footsteps, Chris Nice threw his hat in the ring in 1984 taking his first steps to become a
Dj. The years that followed were spent developing his

Vinyl Record Pool (which became Blazin MP3 Pool) plus co-promoter and DJ for the legendary House of Blues and Live Nation for concerts such as The Black Eyed Peas,
Mary J. Blige, Musiq Soul Child, Chaka Khan,
Anita Baker, etc. Chris Nice was

</h3> <p></p>
<p><i>“This is the best Festival ever. I mean, it’s a family thing, everybody can have a good time, kids, babies, adults, you see everything here, it’s a great time for anybody and everybody.”</i></p>
<i><br/></i><p><i>“Every year it just seems to get better and better…. You know what I mean, every time you say, I don’t know if they can top last year, but still by the end of it, standing ovation all the way around, all around.”</i></p>
<br/><p>The Erie Art Museum Blues &amp; Jazz Festival, now in its 24th year, is the ONLY arts festival in Erie, PA, a beautifully sited city and tourist mecca on the shores of Lake Erie.  When the free Blues &amp; Jazz Festival began in 1992, there was the Summer Festival of the Arts (1966-2014), the Greek Festival (in its third year), We Love Erie Days, and Discover Presque Isle (just one year old). Since then, thirteen (yes, 13!) new festivals have begun in Erie. The sponsorship dollars to support all these free festivals have been sliced thinner and thinner. Business and patron sponsorships pay for performers, stage rental, port-o-lets, sound system, electricians, and all the other costs.</p>
<p>Although the Erie Art Museum Blues &amp; Jazz Festival wins frequent and enthusiastic accolades as the best event of the summer, funding has become challenging, even though the budget has hardly grown. The Museum festival budget is only $75,000! That’s less than a single act at some comparable festivals. <br/></p>

<br/><p>Part of the <a href=""http://erieartmuseum.org/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Erie Art Museum</a>’s mission is to present art in all its forms, including music. The Festival attracts more than 20,000 people to hear musicians ranging from local talents to international superstars. There is the Museum’s kid craft area, and local food vendors serve everything from sausage hoagies and Pittsburgh-style sandwiches to vegetarian wraps, fresh squeezed lemonade and homemade ice cream, but the focus remains on the music.</p>
<br/><p>Booking the Festival lineup is similar to curating an art exhibition. Selections must stand on their own while also complimenting the other choices. Museum Director and Festival curator John Vanco is passionate about blues and jazz. “I listen to music all the time. My library shelves groan with the weight of over 20,000 records. It’s crucial to present authentic music,” Vanco insists. “I favor artists who have a personal style, compose their own music, and are engaged in the tradition. An artist’s fame is not important to me; I will always choose quality over celebrity.”</p>

<br/><br/><p>The Blues &amp; Jazz Festival is completely accessible to the community, with people of all walks of life enjoying great music together. You can see families hosting their annual reunions and picnics at the Festival, and watch the kids who dance in front of the main stage grow up through the years. Seeing the park packed shoulder-to-shoulder all the way to 8th Street is gratifying to anyone who loves great music and our beautiful city. </p>

and other royalty related issues. I started a company called Black Box 
Royalties in 2009 for the sole intent and purpose of helping artists and
 their heirs collect royalty money due to lack of payment from the label
 or publisher. BBR works on a complete contingency basis; if my clients 
do not make any money, neither do I; this I believe is one of the most 
honest and fair ways to have a relationship with an artist who is wary 
due to their past experiences with unfair accounting practices by their 
record label or publisher. <br/><br/>We need financial help for our 
clients due to the costs of audits and legal expertise. A true 
accounting and litigation to enforce that accounting to be upheld is 
crucial in our client's cases. Most of the issues of royalty matters are
 settled though contract law. The record labels and publishers that owe 
our clients’ money use this to their advantage; thus the audit and 
settlement/litigation is the formidable chink in their armor. Many times
 their final defense is hiding behind litigation, basically sue us if 
you want your money.<br/><br/>I would like to share with you two examples 
of our clients I am trying to raise money for.  Also I listed below is 
what the money will be used for and most importantly, I am giving 
everyone who donates at least $10 a minimum a voucher to be redeemed, if a settlement has 
been reached in the client's favor. The contributor can also op for 2 free digital downloads of the artists' music we represent in connection with this fundraiser.  Artist will be revealed once a settlement has been reached.  More information about this below.<br/><br/>Before
 I tell you about some of our client’s stories, please know that the 
vast majority of artists rely on royalty payments as their sole income. 
These people create the jingles for commercials, the song from your high
 school years that wasn't a smash hit but it was one of your favorites. 
They create scores for films and fill our homes both physically and 
digitally with countless hours of music. <br/><br/>Various things go wrong
 with someone's account or life (And sometimes their death) that can be a
 green light to greed for the very people that swear to account to them 
and don't. When an artist or an heir doesn't get paid properly or not at
 all, that is an electric bill, a car payment, food for their children 
or a medical bill that goes by the wayside. It is akin to working for 
someone and not getting paid on a perpetual basis. Please take the time 
to read these short stories and the relevant information below. <br/><br/>Client#1:
 An elderly person living alone. Spouse, all three children are 
deceased. One of these children wrote a hit song that was covered by a 
very well-known artist and made some descent money. This talented artist
 died suddenly and unexpectedly. Within a few short years of passing, 
the royalty payments went from thousands of dollars to less than $50. 
This person is one of the kindest truest people I have met but has had a
 hard time with the passing of her entire family. The song and music 
left behind is what drives this person to keep living and hoping that 
this wrong would be somehow righted. This person is living from one 
social security check to the next when there should be an ample yearly 
supply of music royalties to help supplement. This client did nothing 
wrong, just is simply being taken advantage of thanks to some clever 
accounting. Whole albums, territories and related royalties never appear
 on any statement. The albums exist, are bought and sold, yet there is 
nothing in a statement or in the form of a check to the client for these
 exploitations. A proper accounting through an audit and negotiating a 
better publishing deal is mandatory. We are highly confident that this 
can be achieved, due to the unpaid albums/territories as well as the 
nature of the song and the high profile artist that covered it.<br/><br/>Client#2:
 This case involves an artist that passed away and left everything to an
 heir. The heir lives very modestly and makes carpets for a living.  
Again, with the passing of the artist, greed was given a green light and
 even though all the proper paperwork and documentation were available, 
instead of reaching out and contacting the heir at the exact same 
household in which the artist lived and died, they simply stopped 
sending royalty checks. Phone calls, faxes and other correspondence were
 never returned. Years pass, I discover the problem and get the royalty 
payments going again. After rendering an internal accounting, it was 
shockingly clear that thousands of royalties were not being reported or 
paid by either the label or the publisher. After further investigation, 
it was discovered that percentages of higher earning songs were being 
substituted with lower ones. Many other accounting and legal errors 
exist in this situation with potential fraud.  <br/><br/>What BBR Offers 
ALL Donors: Any donation that is in the amount of $10 or more will be 
reimbursed through a voucher, if and when we are successful in our reclamation efforts. The
 odds of being reimbursed are no less than 50% and in the cases 
mentioned above, much greater. If you would like the opportunity to be 
reimbursed per your donation, kindly leave some contact information.  We are also offering to those contributors who do not wish for a voucher, an opportunity for 2 free digital downloads of the artists' music we represent in connection with this fundraiser.<br/><br/>I
 would like to add in conclusion that our clients need your help to 
claim what is rightfully and legally theirs. In no way, in any manner, 
shape or form will the funds raised for the clients be used for personal
 purposes. The money is solely used for legal and audit expenses. To 
further the transparency of our business practices to the donors, we are
 willing to provide documentation regarding how the donors' funds were 
spent. <br/><br/>Artists and their heirs cannot be expected 
to create music for a living and continuously fight a company with deep 
pockets for what is owed to them.

<p>I've written a lot of music over the years, but only
a relatively small proportion of<span><br/></span>that music has ever been released as commercially
available recordings. The primary barrier has been the cost. My thinking has
always been, ""why should I go to all the time and expense of creating
physical CDs or LPs, seeing as so few people
actually buy them?"" A logical position, particularly now that so many
people seem to think that all music should be available for free. So, I've
just continued creating my music on my own. I decide on a project I'd like to
pursue, immerse myself completely into the process of its creation and generate
a perfect recording of the finished piece of music. Then, I move on to another
piece. It's become something akin to a spiritual practice for me. </p>
Now, I've decided to break that pattern by incorporating into my process
the additional step of creating commercially available physical CDs and LPs.
That's why I'm undertaking this crowd funding campaign via Indiegogo. It

</div><div>
<p>What I've done for this record, is I've looked back
at music I've created over the past decade or so and selected six pieces that
form an aesthetically coherent grouping. Thus the name, ""Six
Projects"". They run the gamut from purely acoustic to purely electronic,
but they all share certain aesthetic attributes and, because of how they're
sequenced, they flow together in a musically satisfying way. </p>
<p>The music on ""Six Projects"" comes directly
from my heart and soul in a way that I cannot articulate with words. It is a
deeply personal expression of who I am as a human being. This music is special, and
therefore I want the packaging to be special as well. Seeing as I'm going beyond the creation of the music itself and creating an actual
physical object, that object should be a work of art. It should be a thing of
beauty – something the listener can enjoy exploring and reading while listening
to the music. That's exactly what I'm striving for. I'm trying to think in
terms of making this a true musical fetish object, for people who appreciate owning a tangible physical connection to the music. </p>
I'm partnering with Innova Recordings for this record and their reputation
and stature should ensure significant art music press coverage. They'll also
handle all of the online and physical media distribution through their
established channels. 
The way it works with Innova is I will have to cover the manufacturing, administrative and marketing costs. Theoretically, I would then recoup those costs through
sales. The break-even point (excluding the LPs) is equivalent to selling roughly 600 CDs. Of course it is an open question as to whether or not I can sell that many, and in my case it will be a tougher lift,
seeing as I'm investing in high-end packaging and vinyl. I keep 100% of the
profits realized from sales, and Innova takes nothing. I also retain ownership
of my recordings.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>This project will be accomplished one way or another. I am committed. The only question is just how broke and in debt I will be at the end of the day. That's why I need your help. I will gladly accept any level of contribution, and if you are unable to help out with money, you can contribute by helping with the record release party or just by spreading the word through your own social media network. Indiegogo provides specialized share tools that you can use as well. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Click on the ""Gallery"" tab above to access more videos and photos.

The music on ""Six Projects"" comes directly
from my heart and soul in a way that I cannot articulate with words. It is a
deeply personal expression of who I am as a human being. This music is special, and
therefore I want the packaging to be special as well. Seeing as I'm going beyond the creation of the music itself and creating an actual
physical object, that object should be a work of art. It should be a thing of
beauty – something the listener can enjoy exploring and reading while listening
to the music. That's exactly what I'm striving for. I'm trying to think in
terms of making this a true musical fetish object, for people who appreciate owning a tangible physical connection to the music. 
I'm partnering with Innova Recordings for this record and their reputation
and stature should ensure significant art music press coverage. They'll also
handle all of the online and physical media distribution through their
established channels. 
The way it works with Innova is I will have to cover the manufacturing, administrative and marketing costs. Theoretically, I would then recoup those costs through
sales. The break-even point (excluding the LPs) is equivalent to selling roughly 600 CDs. Of course it is an open question as to whether or not I can sell that many, and in my case it will be a tougher lift,
seeing as I'm investing in high-end packaging and vinyl. I keep 100% of the
profits realized from sales, and Innova takes nothing. I also retain ownership
of my recordings.This project will be accomplished one way or another. I am committed. The only question is just how broke and in debt I will be at the end of the day. That's why I need your help. I will gladly accept any level of contribution, and if you are unable to help out with money, you can contribute by helping with the record release party or just by spreading the word through your own social media network. Indiegogo provides specialized share tools that you can use as well. Click on the ""Gallery"" tab above to access more videos and photos. There you will find videos about the making of each of the six music projects, the long version of the pitch video with a lot more information and detail, along with other videos and a bunch of photographs.Thank you for taking the time to read through this proposal and for your help.

<h2>Who we are</h2>
<p>We are, <b>Rio &amp; the Rockabilly Revival! </b>An original spitfire roots rock and soul band from Detroit, known for our raw, old school sound, chock-full of sweat, guts and soul. Our live shows have been dubbed ""The church of Rock &amp; Roll"" by critics and fans alike, steeped in the furor of an old southern ""revival"" tent where the ""spirit"" comes right up on you with all the sin, sweat and swagger of gritty rock &amp; roll! </p>
<p>We draw right from the early genres that came together to create what is known today as Rock &amp; Roll: Swing, Country, Jump Blues, Gospel and Blues. It is our mission to honor the legacy built by early rock pioneers who relied solely on their skills and showmanship to whip a crowd into a frenzy. No lip-sync. No smoke and mirrors.  Just legit, from-the-gut music that satisfies both Americana purists as well as modern day rock &amp; roll junkies! </p>
<p>Our fearless front woman is Rio Scafone, niece of Rock &amp; Roll pioneer, Jack Scott. Coming up under his musical wing, she was taught to respect real music played by real musicians along with the hard work that goes into a dynamic stage show. She learned those lessons well. It's part of her musical DNA. She runs a tight ship and makes no apology. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">That means, raw, pure vocals and tight harmonies free of auto tune and layers of effects. It means hands-on musicians who play every note and do not rely on programming, processing and samples. It means giving a full tilt, live show with rich vocals, choreography and pure rock &amp; soul energy.  To us, that also means staying independent and not letting a record label dictate who or what we should be in some attempt to capitalize on the latest trends.  </span></p>
<p><b>We stand for <i>real</i> music for <i>true</i> music lovers who want more than the saccharine ""product"" of the day. </b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>And it works!</h3>
<p></p>
<p>By working hard and staying true to our vision we have built a tight knit fan base and enjoy a wide cross section of fans who connect with our authentic approach. As a result we've struck a chord with music lovers and critics alike. We have three nominations this year for the upcoming <b>Detroit Music Awards</b>, in categories of <b>Outstanding Live Performance</b>, <b>Outstanding Americana Artist/Group</b>, and <b>Rio Scafone as Outstanding Americana Vocalist</b>. We won the title of <b>Hour Detroit Magazine's Best Original Band for 2014</b>, were in the <b>Top 100 Live Unsigned Artists of 2014 by iconic Music Connection Magazine</b> (Los Angeles), have been featured headline artists in music festivals, as well as the only musical act ever tapped for the <b>Emmy Award winning Woodward Dream Cruise Television Special (ABC Television)</b> - <i>twice</i>!

It has been two years since that project, and since I took the leap and fully immersed myself in music as a full time singer/songwriter.

I invite you to be a part of <i><b>Zaneliza: How The Water Moves</b></i>. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4><b>WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE: </b></h4>
<p>The making of this album is almost complete and the music exists! Musicians, who are also dear friends of mine, joined me in my home town from different parts of the country to record the bulk of the album at the Miriam Makeba Performing Arts Centre (ECAVC), a place which has shown me much support and is very close to my heart. In December 2014, I began the recording process with a session at Peter Aurets studio. Three months later, we now have one more Joburg session left in order to add the last layer of flute, harp and cello. This campaign is mainly to bring to fruition what has been created, and to ensure great post- production takes place to honour the creativity that has already been shown. </p>
<p>I have had the pleasure of working with a wonderful production team consting of Nduduzo Makhathini (Standard Bank Young Artist of the Year for Music 2015) and Cobus Van Dyk, who co-produced my EP ""<i><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/msakimvana/msaki"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nal'ithemba</a>""</i> with me. The amazing Gavan Eckhart of Soulfire studios will be mixing and mastering this album. He has worked with artists like Ray Phiri, Miriam Makeba, Lady Smith Black Mambazo, Marcus Wyatt, Freshly Ground and Bongeziwe Mabandla, to name a few, and has had projects that he has worked on be nominated for SAMAS and Grammies. This project is in good hands. </p>

<p>The deluxe version of this album was recorded with emphasis on capturing the energy of multiple musicians in one room. We were more interested in the organic movement and development of the music than the perfect take. I have approached this album as a piece of art, allowing room for imperfection to ultimately add to the feel of the music and fearlessly and unapologetically capture my 'Now' sound. It is really a snapshot in time. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We were not bound  by any conventional idea of what an album should sound like and instead approached it thematically as the unfolding of sonic art.The songs are vessels for messages and motifs, and the chords and melodies are the colours and textures. The sound is both old and new, symphonic and 'folky', soulful and simple, African and universal. </span><br/></p>
<p>I hope everyone can find their own unique ripple through it. This deluxe album is only available to the people that pre-order now and help finance the existence of this album. You are my Golden circle. I will be releasing a skinnier version of the album later in the year. </p>

<h4>
<b>THE DEAL</b> </h4>
<p>Take a look at some examples of the beautiful offerings we have for you, in return for your contribution to bringing this vision to life. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">These artists are not short of bravery, sensitivity and honesty in the least. I have been
moved by their work and they have spoken such kind encouragement into me at different times
when I really needed some perspective and staying power. More importantly I believe there is
synergy between our work and some space to play between the visual and the audio planes.  </span></p>

</div></div>","THE PROJECT:
In 2013 I launched my EP ""Nalithemba"". It has been two years since that project, and since I took the leap and fully immersed myself in music as a full time singer/songwriter. The journey has been incredible, and so much growth has come since and from that EP, that I feel the time is right to share with you a full-length studio offering. I invite you to be a part of Zaneliza: How The Water Moves. 

WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE: 
The making of this album is almost complete and the music exists! Musicians, who are also dear friends of mine, joined me in my home town from different parts of the country to record the bulk of the album at the Miriam Makeba Performing Arts Centre (ECAVC), a place which has shown me much support and is very close to my heart. In December 2014, I began the recording process with a session at Peter Aurets studio. Three months later, we now have one more Joburg session left in order to add the last layer of flute, harp and cello. This campaign is mainly to bring to fruition what has been created, and to ensure great post- production takes place to honour the creativity that has already been shown. 
I have had the pleasure of working with a wonderful production team consting of Nduduzo Makhathini (Standard Bank Young Artist of the Year for Music 2015) and Cobus Van Dyk, who co-produced my EP ""Nal'ithemba"" with me. The amazing Gavan Eckhart of Soulfire studios will be mixing and mastering this album. He has worked with artists like Ray Phiri, Miriam Makeba, Lady Smith Black Mambazo, Marcus Wyatt, Freshly Ground and Bongeziwe Mabandla, to name a few, and has had projects that he has worked on be nominated for SAMAS and Grammies. This project is in good hands. 


This is a BIG vision,  and big visions require big funding. Recording an album is expensive. I have spent just over three beautiful years sharing my music and developing an audience for my sound. It seems that you are here, listening and responding, so I thought I would ask YOU to help me fund this dream which we have planned to launch on  25 September 2015.   


WHAT STILL NEEDS TO HAPPEN
All  money   raised   will   go   towards:   
* Mixing and Mastering
*  Print  and   Packaging of   albums  
*  Delivery of Albums and Art
* Marketing and PR support
* Most importantly paying the rest of the session fees
* Exhibition and Launch

THE MUSIC

The deluxe version of this album was recorded with emphasis on capturing the energy of multiple musicians in one room. We were more interested in the organic movement and development of the music than the perfect take. I have approached this album as a piece of art, allowing room for imperfection to ultimately add to the feel of the music and fearlessly and unapologetically capture my 'Now' sound. It is really a snapshot in time. 
We were not bound  by any conventional idea of what an album should sound like and instead approached it thematically as the unfolding of sonic art.The songs are vessels for messages and motifs, and the chords and melodies are the colours and textures. The sound is both old and new, symphonic and 'folky', soulful and simple, African and universal. 
I hope everyone can find their own unique ripple through it. This deluxe album is only available to the people that pre-order now and help finance the existence of this album. You are my Golden circle. I will be releasing a skinnier version of the album later in the year. 
 

THE DEAL 
Take a look at some examples of the beautiful offerings we have for you, in return for your contribution to bringing this vision to life. These artists are not short of bravery, sensitivity and honesty in the least. I have been
moved by their work and they have spoken such kind encouragement into me at different times
when I really needed some perspective and staying power. More importantly I believe there is
synergy between our work and some space to play between the visual and the audio planes.  






One Shushu Day Handmade Dream Journals in assorted colours 

Kate  Arthur   (CPT)   painting  
  Original Watercolour on Canvas by Kate Arthur

Kate wants to engage you. She makes miniature works, usually portraits. Her references are usually taken from public spaces like social media. Allow her to stalk you and surprise you with an image of yourself. She has been part of several successful shows in Cape Town this year, including 'THAT ART FAIR' quite recently. She was also one of the first visual artist to have a city soiree event. Look out for her work in and around Cape Town. 

Emalie  Bingham   (CPT)   mixed   media  

  Original Oil on Canvas by Emalie Bingham 
Emalie is an Artist living and working in Cape Town, South Africa. She will be reacting-  to songs, to  feeling, to sound,  a word, a theme - anything triggered by the album and the making thereof, or conversation about and around it. A most intuitive worker whose work will be in all stages of this project. She made these three works to a song called 'Catalyst' on the project.  They are each available for $150.

Aiah Fodo (JHB) digital art
.Original Digitial Painting by Aiah Fodo 

 Aiah's main desire is to capture colour and experiment with varied forms of patterning and shading on the human facial matrix.  Her work is, within itself, an expression of human facial appreciation. She is member of Pretoria's Capital Arts Revolution and she is also contributing to the album art and her work will also be featured in the exhibition. These three works are available to anyone who contributes $150 to the album. 



Laduma Ngxokolo (Maxhosa by Laduma)


Laduma saw me in perfoming at the Opera house in PE and gravitated towards one of my songs called 'Imfama Ziyabona'. He said: "" When you shoot that video, I want you to be wearing my clothes"". Laduma Ngxokolo is a South African textile and knitwear designer, best known for his men's knitwear range inspired by traditional Xhosa beadwork, who beat out 10 other African designers to win the inaugural Vogue Scouting for Africa prize and will get a chance to present his designs at the international showcase of Palazzo Morando in Milan, Italy, in September and at the Africa International Fashion Week in Lagos, Nigeria in December.
He is offering one of his signature jerseys to anyone who pledges $250 towards my project. 


Andile Dyalvane (IMISO Ceramics)



Andile Dyalvane is the founder of Imiso Ceramics. He is a well traveled designer who prides himself in being South African, and presents that pride through his work at every opportunity. Clay gives him the ability to create something beautiful, valuable and usable with four elements of life: earth, water, and fire. He is creating two brand new pieces inspired and guided by two songs on the project, Golden and Selah. One of the works will be auctioned on the evening of the Zaneliza Launch Event, with another available to you as a perk for  $400.

3. Nichi necesita tu ayuda para poder hacer esto y solo tiene 21 días para juntar la plata para la producción y el diseño (She needs your support to make this happen and has only 21 days to raise the money for production and design.)

Resumido por Nichi


Tengo 22 años y vivo en Hurlingham, Buenos Aires. Desde muy chiquita me empecé a relacionar con la música tocando distintos instrumentos y cantando, pero hace muy poco que empecé a mostrarlo.  
Dos oportunidades increíbles aparecieron este año: Grabar mi primer disco e irme a tocar a Estados Unidos. Sería muchísimo más que muy lindo para mi poder contar con la ayuda de ustedes para concretar lo que se me presentó. 
La magnitud de poder hacer esto es sinceramente increíble. Es nada menos que cumplir mi sueño.

   Lo que necesito para cumplirlo:  Necesito que me ayuden a conseguir 2000 dólares para grabar, producir, diseñar e imprimir los discos.  Además de hacerme feliz ayudándome a concretar mi proyecto, está bueno que yo de algo a cambio asi que estuve pensando en retribuir su ayuda y dar a cambio distintas cosas. Si no logro el objetivo, cosa que felizmente dudo porque ustedes son lo más, lo recaudado va a ir a poder hacer mi pagina web.


    Desafios  Muchos de ustedes saben lo que significa para mi la música. No pasa un día en el que no toque por lo menos un acorde. Mi objetivo más importante es poder llevar a cabo este proyecto.     Otras formas que tienen de ayudarme  Seguramente no todos puedan ayudarme de una forma económica, pero eso no quiere decir que no tengan formas de darme una mano. Por ejemplo pueden ayudarme a compartir este proyecto! :)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h3> <p><b>Evil Genius</b> represents the unlikely fusion of three musicians (two from Los Angeles and one from Brooklyn) who met while attending California Institute of the Arts. The group assembled during the winter of 2012. We are <b>Max Kutner</b> (<i>The Grandmothers of Invention, Bubbeleh, The Royal US, The Magic Band</i>), <b>Stefan Kac</b> (<i>Ingo Bethke, Milo Fine Free Jazz Ensemble, Hammerstein Musik Bavaria</i>) and <b>Michael ""Bonepocket"" Lockwood</b> (<i>Stupid Man Suit, Teebs, Atomic Ape, Michael Mull 8tet</i>). <br/></p>
<p>That's right. Guitar, drums and tuba. But not just any guitar. Not just any drums. And definitely not just any tuba.<br/></p>
<p>The intention of the group is explore the farthest flung musical 
liberties within the restrictions of both sparse instrumentation and 
minimally structured compositions written by any of its members. At the same time, this music can and should be approached by anyone.<br/></p>
<p>After 2 years of gestation, the band has recorded its debut album entitled ""<b>Bitter Human</b>"". There are ten completely original tracks for your listening pleasure on this album. <b>Orenda Records</b> will be our most gracious host for the project as well and this document will provide the basis for tours to follow later this year. We've been fortunate enough to make it through the tracking and post-production process totally on our own.<br/></p>
<p>We're here to ask for your support in funding the final stage of this process: printing. Your contributions will help fund the design of our album packaging and also provide for the printing of 500 copies of ""<b>Bitter Human</b>"" which will go to listeners, reviewers, promoters and our families. We feel very strongly about the quality of music presented here and feel that the album deserves a proper pressing and presentation to compliment those songs. This is where you guys come in and there are some absurdly awesome perks for your donations.<br/></p>
<h3><b>Baby, baby breakdown.</b></h3>
</div><div> <p>The amount we are asking for is $3,000 and breaks down thus:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1900 - Pressing of 500 CDs of ""<b>Bitter Human</b>"" in a 6-panel digipak with art by Vanessa Himeles and designs by Eron Rauch.</li>
<li>$700 - Mailing and promotional costs to worldwide radio, print and other media outlets. </li>
<li>$200 - Eron Rauch's design.</li>
<li>$200 - IndieGogo processing fees.</li>
</ul>
<p>As I mentioned in the beginning, we have a bevy of assorted perks and rewards for your contributions to this process. Stuff ranging from downloads to physical cds, cds/dvds from any of our other projects, cooked goods, scrabble/golf/html lessons, production credits and even a miniature piece of midi music written by a member of your choice and dedicated to you!</p>
<p>Absolutely none of the funds will go toward superfluous use. We use all of the animal.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Giant thumbprint.<br/>
</h3> <p>This music is completely original, written especially for Evil Genius by members of the band. It does not cater to the needs of a movement, style clique or higher authority. It operates based from the fractured logic and particular tastes of its members. In other words, it is kinda like orange chicken sauteed with pizza sauce covered in honey and served over rocky road ice cream. Why not?</p>
<p>Recordings and projects from each member of the band have been heard and liked all over the world by an enormous swath of people listening from all sorts of backgrounds and bases. By donating to our cause, you will in turn be supporting the creation and documentation of new music. From 1 dollar and up, you will be an invaluable part of this process. <br/></p>
<ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>A game of risk.<br/>
</h3> <p> Evil Genius fully acknowledges the possibility that it may take awhile for ""<b>Bitter Human</b>"" to reach the people it needs to and that the world is certainly not short on musicians looking for support. <br/></p>

<h1>Kampanya Hakkında</h1>
<p>Merve Kocabeyler henüz 24 yaşında ve çok önemli başarılara imza atmış bir arpist. Bugüne dek katıldığı yarışmalara kendine ait bir arpı olmadan, okullardaki kısıtlı çalışma sürelerini kullanarak hazırlandı ve üç kez birincilik kazandı!</p>
<p>Gurur kaynağımız olan Merve, Amsterdam Konservatuvarı'nda burslu olarak sürdürdüğü yüksek lisans çalışmalarını tamamlamak üzere. Profesyonel yaşama atıldığı bu önemli dönemde kendine ait bir enstrümana ihtiyacı var. <br/></p>
<h3>Merve'nin artık kendi arpı olsun istiyoruz!</h3><div><br/></div> <p></p>

<br/><h1>Hedefimiz</h1>
<p>Merve'nin ihtiyacı olan Lyon&amp;Healy yapımı arpı satın almak ve Türkiye'ye getirmek için <b>€35.600</b> gerekli. Internet üzerinden başlattığımız destek kampanyası bu miktarı toplamak için giriştiğimiz çabanın bir parçası.<br/></p>
<p>Genç arpistimizin 23 Şubat akşamı Caddebostan Kültür Merkezi'nde verdiği arp resitalinde ona destek olmak isteyen sanatseverler <b>5.600TL</b> bağışta bulundu. Bu resitalle ilgili CNN Türk'te yayınlanan haber için <a href=""http://www.cnnturk.com/haber/kultur-sanat/muzik/merve-kocabeyler-arp-sahibi-olabilmek-icin-konser-veriyor"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tıklayın</a>.<br/></p>
<p>Merve'nin daha çok konser verebilmesi, yurtdışında ülkemizi temsil etmeye devam edebilmesi için sevenleri olarak onu çok hak ettiği enstrümanına kavuşturmak istiyoruz. Sizin de desteğinizi bekliyoruz.</p><p><br/></p>

<h3>We would like to help Merve to buy a harp!</h3>
<p>Merve
Kocabeyler, who is only 24, is a young and highly promising harpist with many
accomplishments. In the competitions she has participated so far, she achieved
amazing results and got the 1<sup>st</sup> place in three different
organizations despite not having a harp and preparing for competitions in
schools that provided her with limited sources and practice hours. Merve is
currently finishing her Master’s in Amsterdam Conservatory and she needs an
instrument of her own in this crucial phase of her life where she is
transitioning into a professional career. And we want to make her dream come
true!</p>
<h2>Our Goal</h2>
Our aim is to raise <b>€35.600</b> to buy a Lyon &amp; Healy brand harp 
and ship it to Turkey for Merve. The crowdfunding project we started 
online is a way to accomplish this goal. In our young harpist’s recital in Caddebostan Cultural Center on February 23rd, art lovers donated an amount of <b>5.600TL (2200$)</b> for her cause.

<p>For Merve to be able to give more concerts, and represent Turkey

 well-deserved instrument. We would very much appreciate your help as

<p><u><strong>Overview</strong></u></p>
<p>It's been about 2 years since my last album ""Postcards From Berlin"". In that time I've been super busy, playing keyboards on tour with electronic music legend, Gary Numan, producing music for films and TV shows and helping other artists with their projects.</p>
<p>But now it's time to do something for <u>YOU</u> once again and so I'm producing a special, new, double EP of [debut] music.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>The Plan</strong></u></p>
<p>As you know,  I'm always trying to reinvent myself when I put out new work and this time is no different and I have to say that I'm super excited about what's coming your way. Here's what's in the pipeline:</p>
<p><strong>EP#1 : ""Hello"" </strong>// This is upbeat and intense, still with my trademark darkness but I think you will like the almost exclusively electronic sound on this. It's tight, punchy and gets your feet moving and it's just me on vocals. There will be at least 5 tracks with 1 or 2 bonus, unreleased tracks thrown in for people who back me on Indiegogo.</p>
<p><strong>EP#2 : ""The Battle"" </strong>// This is a super intense and hard-hitting instrumental piece. It's essentially 6-tracks all rolled in to one long DJ style mega-mix. If you like Deadmau5 and The Chemical Brothers then you will love this.</p>
<p><strong>[debut] ARTBOOK </strong>// This is a limited edition collection of black and white photos that I've gathered over the past 4 years. Most have never been seen before and they cover the period from ""Starting to Love it"" through ""Postcards From Berlin"", touring with Gary Numan and the making of ""Hello"".</p>
<p><strong>Live in 2017</strong> // Once the EP's are finished I want to get on the road and bring them to you through some special live events. I'll be using a combination of live performance and film projections to give you a great concert experience in an intimate party setting.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>Your Help</strong></u></p>
<p>As you know, all of this takes $$$.</p>
<p>To release the EP's I have to record the music, mix it, master it then get the limited edition items made, get covers and books designed, photos done, music videos produced, T-shirts printed, etc, etc.</p>
<p>To play it all live I have to invest in new equipment, lights, custom films, projection screens, venues, travel, hotels, etc, etc</p>
<p>This is where <u>YOU</u> come in.</p>
<p>In return for supporting me now, you will be the first to get your hands on the new music plus special backer-only merchandise, experiences and one-off items that won't be available anywhere else. You'll be helping me to stay fully independent, cutting out the middle-man so I can bring you my work faster, better and at a lower price. You'll also be on the VIP list for the live shows!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p><u><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></u></p>
<p>I'm setting TWO targets that I hope you will help me meet</p>
<p><u>Target #1 // $10,000 total</u></p>
<p>For this I can produce both EP's of music plus the art and merchandise that goes with it. This is my minimum target goal.</p>
<p><u>Target #2 // $20,000 total</u></p>
<p>For this I can also produce at least 3 special live events, one each in Los Angeles, New York and London. I'll play both EP's live and also do other [debut] songs with hopefully some special guest appearances. If i get to $20k EVERYONE who has backed me will get an invite to any or all of the shows! (I can even get to Berlin if we break $22k)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>Timeline</strong></u></p>
<p>The plan is to run this Indiegogo campaign for 30 days</p>
<p>At the end of that 30 days, everyone who has backed me will get an instant download of ""The Battle"".</p>
<p>I will then focus on completing the ""Hello"" EP and aim to get it to you (along with the other one-off's and merchandise) by late Summer.</p>
<p>Then, if we've hit $20k goal I will play the live shows around September time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>The ""What-Ifs""</strong></u></p>
<p>Ok, we can all be positive here but what happens if we don't hit the $ targets? The reality is that without the funding I simply won't be able do everything I set out to do. Only when I see the final $# will I be able to tell you what I can deliver and what I can't deliver. If what I can offer simply doesn't cut it for you at that stage then you can get your $ back if you so wish.</p>
<p>But that's not going to happen right!!! Together we all did an amazing crowdfunder for the ""Postcards From Berlin"" album and everything turned out better than expected, so we have a history of doing this and getting it right!</p>

<p>If you are reading this, you probably already know that we are Tree Tops, a progressive groove rock band based in Knoxville, Tennessee. It has been our absolute pleasure to play for you all over the Southeast in the recent past, and we're excited to finally share our first full length studio recording with you! We have been able to fund the project ourselves so far, but the bank has run dry and we aren't nearly finished with all of our plans. We need your help!</p>
<p>Right now, we have finished tracking, and our incredible producer Chris Pope is in Boone, NC, finishing things up for us and getting these songs sounding real good for ya! Meanwhile in Nashville, TN, the amazing Kyle Kelly is hard at work on some amazing designs that will become the album art, a fresh look on our website and the latest Tree Tops T-shirt design. Thanks to your support over the past year on the road, we have enough money to pay these gentlemen to perform their magic, but this is where the money runs out.</p>
<p>We've put together a little budget to show you guys exactly why we are asking you to give us your hard-earned money and to give you a taste of all the cool stuff we are attempting to pull off with your help!</p>
<p>- Music Video (we'll tell you what song it's for later ;) don't worry)</p>
<p>- Digital Distribution of LP</p>
<p>- Digital Distribution of Singles</p>
<p>- CD Printing</p>
<p>- Advertising</p>
<p>- Merchandise</p>
<p>As you can see, we've got our work cut out for us!</p>
<p>The awesome thing about IndieGoGo is we get to offer you ""perks"" in exchange for your donations. You can pre-order the record and gain access to an advanced digital copy, get invited to a special listening party, have a private music lesson with one of the members of Tree Tops, or even shave David's head on stage at one of our shows. We've dreamed up some great ways to thank you for your contributions! We've set our budget high enough to accommodate absolutely everything we'd like to do for this album, but don't worry too much. If we don't make it quite there, we'll still receive the donations you have made and put them to good use!</p>
<p>The opportunity to create and release this record has made us infinitely closer as a band and friends. We are incredibly proud of what we have created here and believe that we have quite the story to tell. We all love music more than we could possibly describe to you, and our main ambition is to share this thing we love with as many people as possible. We are going to do WHATEVER it takes to make that happen, and we greatly appreciate your help! If you can't donate but would still like to help, or if you wish to help in addition to donating, please share this campaign with your friends and family and encourage them to donate as well! Thank you!</p>
<p>We love you very much,</p>
<p>Cory, David and Jon</p>

Thanks to your support over the past year on the road, we have enough money to pay these gentlemen to perform their magic, but this is where the money runs out.
We've put together a little budget to show you guys exactly why we are asking you to give us your hard-earned money and to give you a taste of all the cool stuff we are attempting to pull off with your help!
- Music Video (we'll tell you what song it's for later ;) don't worry)
- Digital Distribution of LP
- Digital Distribution of Singles
- CD Printing
- Advertising
- Merchandise
As you can see, we've got our work cut out for us!
The awesome thing about IndieGoGo is we get to offer you ""perks"" in exchange for your donations. You can pre-order the record and gain access to an advanced digital copy, get invited to a special listening party, have a private music lesson with one of the members of Tree Tops, or even shave David's head on stage at one of our shows. We've dreamed up some great ways to thank you for your contributions! We've set our budget high enough to accommodate absolutely everything we'd like to do for this album, but don't worry too much. If we don't make it quite there, we'll still receive the donations you have made and put them to good use!
The opportunity to create and release this record has made us infinitely closer as a band and friends. We are incredibly proud of what we have created here and believe that we have quite the story to tell. We all love music more than we could possibly describe to you, and our main ambition is to share this thing we love with as many people as possible. We are going to do WHATEVER it takes to make that happen, and we greatly appreciate your help! If you can't donate but would still like to help, or if you wish to help in addition to donating, please share this campaign with your friends and family and encourage them to donate as well! Thank you!
We love you very much,

<h3>Keeping Tradition Alive</h3>
<p>My previous album, <i>The Navajo Piano</i>, began as a project to preserve the music of the Navajo people. Traditional songs and chants are passed down orally, and were never written down. My hope was to record my grandfather singing, and write the music down for preservation. However, the project was not so simple, and I ended up with a full album of piano pieces based on the traditional chants my grandfather recorded.</p>
<p>Now, I want to to take the project to the next level. My goal is to create piano pieces based on Navajo musical practices, while also including my grandfather singing on several tracks with the piano. I'm hoping to merge tradition with new music, as a way to promote the culture and inspire other Native Americans to reach into their background and preserve their music.</p>

<p>Since my grandpa Keith lives on the reservation, recording him is difficult. He either has to make a long trip to Phoenix (about 5 hours each way), or I have to bring all of the recording equipment to him (and he has limited electrical outlets and power). I also do not currently have professional-quality recording equipment. We'll either need money to pay for his transportation and studio time, or we'll need to upgrade my equipment so we can get clean recordings at his hogan. </p>

<p><strong>How it all started</strong></p>
<p>beißpony is based in the midst of a buzzing collective of artists. It all started at the Kafe Kult. It’s one of the oldest DIY venues in Munich, founded in the ‘80s. Allison Wolfe from Bratmobile played there, The Notwist, AIDS Wolf, Chain And The Gang, Des Ark, Mika Miko, Lightning Bolt, Kickballl, The Good Good, Lydia Lunch and Jeffrey Lewis.</p>
<p>beißpony's percussionist Stephanie Müller used to be part of the booking collective for a couple of years and all these different musicians inspired her a lot. The Kafe Kult is also the place where she met Laura Melis Theis for the very first time. It was during a Kimya Dawson concert in 2006. It didn’t take long and they startet their own music project – beißpony. Meanwhile Laura is based in Oxford (UK). In the years since they started, they’ve always been trying to bring together artists from all over the world.</p>
<p>BEASTS AND LONERS is their upcoming album. With your help Laura and Stephanie can make it happen.</p>
<p>Feel free to preorder their LP via indiegogo or to choose one of their unique pieces of artwork.</p>
<p>You don't have a credit card?</p>
<p>Please don't hesitate and contact beißpony via rag_treasure@gmx.de. For everybody without credit cards, Laura and Stephanie also offer bank transfer or PayPal. Just drop them an Email and tell them what you'd love to get &gt; rag_treasure@gmx.de.</p>
<p><strong>Vinyl Production</strong></p>
<p>First of all Laura and Stephanie want to finance the vinyl production. The pressing of 500 albums on vinyls costs around 1.800 Euros.</p>
<p>Stefan Dorner and Fabian Zweck are the ones who never ever stopped supporting them since the very beginning of beißpony in 2006. They also recorded and produced BEASTS AND LONERS together with Laura and Stephanie. Both of them spent innumerable hours on the album production. If beißpony's crowdfunding campaign makes it possible, Laura and Stephanie would also love to support them for their incredible work.</p>
<p><strong>Artwork</strong></p>Each LP comes with a download code and a unique piece of cover and poster artwork.<p>beißpony's artwork is based on an exciting collaboration. Klaus Erich Dietl who supports beißpony with a whole variety of music videos and visuals for their live performances, contributed a hand drawn picture puzzle with lots of love for the tiny details. In addition to his cover, BEASTS AND LONERS’ striking and unique poster artwork was produced by Deidra Mesayu from the queer-feminist collective Royal Family Club (Yogjakarta, Indonesia). Stephanie met her during her tour in Indonesia last April. With your help beißpony can finance the printing costs (around 700 Euros) and they have the chance to support Klaus and Deidra a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>Further collaborations</strong></p>
<p>Besides Deidra, Fabian, Klaus and Stefan a couple of other inspiring artists and musicians supported BEAST AND LONERS. They contributed as guest musicians or producers. beißpony might not be able to raise money for all of them. Nevertheless, lots of hugs and love go out to all of them!</p>
<p>The songs feature Michael Krogmann’s double bass, Martin Majewski’s trumpet, Josip Pavlov’s guitar, Wolfi Schlick’s tuba, Neil Vaggers’ trombone, Herbert Schneider ‘s drums, sitar and tabla, Mirjam Stutzmann’s accordion, and Martina Taubenberger’s clarinet, German flute, and sax - and a whole host of choir singers (including Max Amling, Florian a. Betz, Klaus Erich Dietl, Moni Kliche, Katharina Wilczek, Tobias Wullert ) on the album closer Up In Arms. All songs were produced by Fabian Zweck and Stefan Dorner, except RAIN IS OVERRATED. Colin Djukic who already contributed to beißpony's debut album, produced this song.</p>
<p><strong>Your support</strong></p>
<p>Feel free to choose from our selection of perks and rewards. There are special album editions waiting for you, textile treasures and lots more. Don't hesitate! Even the tiniest donation helps beißpony to finance BEASTS AND LONERS and to support their friends, who put so much love and effort into the album. </p>
<p>And if you are not so much into donating, feel free to spread the word and tell your friends about beißpony's  project.</p>
<p>THANK YOU SO MUCH</p>
<p><strong>More detailled information about beißpony and BEASTS AND LONERS</strong></p>
</div><p>Four years after their celebrated debut BRUSH YOUR TEETH on Chicks On Speed Records, beißpony are now releasing their follow-up album BEASTS AND LONERS.</p><p>Those intervening years have seen numerous new developments for the band – from their invitation to SXSW in Austin (TX, USA), to the INTERNATIONAL SHORTFILM FESTIVAL in Oberhausen, to exciting solo ventures such as Stephanie Müller’s A DUET OF AMPLIFIED SEWING MACHINES tour with Lisa S. Caneiro in Indonesia, or Laura Theis’ solo release BADASS SNOW WHITE in the UK. Further highlights include music compositions for a collaboration with Wolfgang Müller (DIE TÖDLICHE DORIS) and for a radio play written by nobel prize winner Elfriede Jelinek. Thanks to the Munich based artist and cinematographer Klaus Erich Dietl, they also had the chance to become part of a feature film production. For OUR MOUTH – THE ULTIMATE PRISON they composed music and developed the set and costume design. Recently the feature was premiered at the Munich based LENBACHAUS. The follow-up is already in the making.</p><p>In the midst of all these exciting new adventures, beißpony started their own label RAGREC. It was in 2016 during a vibrant exchange with artists from all over the globe. About 35 artists located in Germany, Hawaii, Japan, South Africa, UK and the Ukraine shared their ideas on ALLIGATOR GOZAIMASU. It is an intriguing, multi-facetted piece of work. Most of the songs are based on a public recording session at the IMPORT EXPORT, an underground venue located in the heart of Munich. People of all ages and different backgrounds - queer activists, young refugees and artists such as German filmmaker Doris Dörrie - took part.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508153547/t6fbw717w0hazdpsspqm.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>ALLIGATOR GOZAIMASU definitely left it's mark on the upcoming beißpony album. BEASTS AND LONERS is crossing all separators with a fierce love for complexity and no fear of life's dissonances.</p><p>BEASTS AND LONERS is an album showcasing exciting collaborations and international exchange, which is not surprising considering its fascinating genesis:</p><p>In 2014, Munich-based Stephanie Müller and Oxford-based Laura Theis were invited to develop an experimental piece of musical theatre during the walpurgis theater’s Feniks Festival Artist Residency in Mortsel, Belgium.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508153263/suqtxar6lfbliuvyfsgi.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Their performance was originally based on a pamphlet of Theis’ poems and short stories entitled ‘Beasts and Loners’, yet from this it grew and morphed into a mixed media composition that incorporated a whole array of local influences including an encounter with the SPACE LADY (La Junta, Colorado, USA) and a trip to a spoken word theatre adaptation of the famous RUMBLE IN THE JUNGLE boxing match. The exchange with fellow artist-in-residence Mikio Saito (Sapporo, Japan) even led to an extensive cultural exchange between the underground scenes in Munich and Sapporo.</p><p>From this, the songs developed further. BEASTS AND LONERS is an album that has its unique strength in collaboration and beißpony have managed to assemble a very exciting array of guest musicians and performers.</p><p>Musically, it is even more versatile than its predecessor: The songs feature Michael Krogmann’s double bass, Martin Majewski’s trumpet, Josip Pavlov’s guitar, Wolfi Schlick’s tuba, Neil Vaggers’ trombone, Herbert Schneider ‘s drums, sitar and tabla, Mirjam Stutzmann’s accordion, and Martina Taubenberger’s clarinet, German flute, and sax - and a whole host of choir singers (including Max Amling, Florian a. Betz, Klaus Erich Dietl, Moni Kliche, Katharina Wilczek, Tobias Wullert ) on the album closer Up In Arms.</p><p>And with every new track the listener can tell that beißpony and their producers Fabian Zweck and Stefan Dorner (Rain Is Overrated is guest produced by Colin Djukic) are not afraid to experiment. Most of the songs were recorded at the MEDIENDIENST LEISTUNGSHÖLLE and at the KAFE KULT in Munich. They feature an eclectic variety of styles ranging from spoken word (e.g. the psychedelic Kraut piece Shadow Companion or the jazzy Japanese Oto-Hime) to the heavy My Abstraction Capability Equals Zero to the 60ies pop of the album’s opener Lord of the Wings to name but a few. Some songs are stripped down, lo-fi and rough, some are opulent, there is a-capella singing and animal noises generated by human voices.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508152870/jxuclxdh0ovbowkeddvz.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>BEASTS AND LONERS rewards the listener for paying close attention because there is a lot going on between the lines. In a delicate and humorous way the album addresses and communicates the rough and uncanny aspects of life.</p><p>Songs like Ambroxol, Malt &amp; Heavy Beats, More Excuse than Escape may appear in the deceptive guise of a jaunty tune, only to reveal bitingly sharp lyrics that question society’s double standards, growing up in an alienating, bigoted social environment full of petit bourgeois reservations, or offer a disenchanted look at what drives people to futile workaholism.</p><p>Lord of the Wings, written from the point of view of a ruthless wing man, takes an ironic dig at the misogynist world views inherent in the Pick Up Artist community. Identities are not fixed, they can be played with - Never Seen A Movie That Doesn’t Star Bruce Willis recounts the unlikely love affair between a wrestler and a librarian, and the gender-bent Rumble is completely made up from original quotes by the boxers Muhammad Ali and George Foreman.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508153034/psft8ghr6s5ndbx9ptlg.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>BEASTS AND LONERS is an album unafraid of complexity and in-between spaces, of looking behind facades. And especially the words to Shadow Companion, based on a poem by Jewish German language poet Mascha Kaléko who managed to emigrate to the US in 1938, seem very apt and poignant for the experience many refugees have to go through in our current times: “Do not say mine, everything is on loan … make your home but keep the suitcase on hand … take your own shadow for a companion”.</p><p>Like Shadow Companion also the album's closer is based on poetry. Up In Arms derives from a tanka (Japanese poem consisting of 31 syllables) Stephanie found at the Sapporo based RETRO SPACE. It was written by the owner of the space, Kazutaka Saka. Back in his early twenties he was involved in the 1960ies protest movement. In his poem he is questioning whether he and his fellows will have any chance to inspire further generations. Saka was a friend of Etsuko Takano, a Japanese activist who committed suicide in the late 1960ies. Based on Saka's poem and on excerpts from Etsuko Takano’s suicide note, beißpony wrote a a very quiet, delicate resistance song: “Tomorrow is another day / because I believe it / I set up the barricades /How much I'm passionate / to whom should I tell?”</p><p>BEASTS AND LONERS is an album for everyone who is ready to take off the blinkers and to explore new boulevards of thoughts. It is impossible to reduce the richness of this album to a single theme. Nobody is just one thing (just a beast, just a loner). The songs encourage the listeners to have a closer look and to dig deeper into complex questions. The album is a work under construction and therefore doesn’t offer any ready-made solutions, but rather encourages independent thought and a share in the wonderings of beißpony’s minds.</p><p> </p><p>*****UPDATE********<br/><br/>Trouble with Card Payment?

Vinyl Production
First of all Laura and Stephanie want to finance the vinyl production. The pressing of 500 albums on vinyls costs around 1.800 Euros.
Stefan Dorner and Fabian Zweck are the ones who never ever stopped supporting them since the very beginning of beißpony in 2006. They also recorded and produced BEASTS AND LONERS together with Laura and Stephanie. Both of them spent innumerable hours on the album production. If beißpony's crowdfunding campaign makes it possible, Laura and Stephanie would also love to support them for their incredible work.
ArtworkEach LP comes with a download code and a unique piece of cover and poster artwork.beißpony's artwork is based on an exciting collaboration. Klaus Erich Dietl who supports beißpony with a whole variety of music videos and visuals for their live performances, contributed a hand drawn picture puzzle with lots of love for the tiny details. In addition to his cover, BEASTS AND LONERS’ striking and unique poster artwork was produced by Deidra Mesayu from the queer-feminist collective Royal Family Club (Yogjakarta, Indonesia). Stephanie met her during her tour in Indonesia last April. With your help beißpony can finance the printing costs (around 700 Euros) and they have the chance to support Klaus and Deidra a little bit.
Further collaborations
Besides Deidra, Fabian, Klaus and Stefan a couple of other inspiring artists and musicians supported BEAST AND LONERS. They contributed as guest musicians or producers. beißpony might not be able to raise money for all of them. Nevertheless, lots of hugs and love go out to all of them!
The songs feature Michael Krogmann’s double bass, Martin Majewski’s trumpet, Josip Pavlov’s guitar, Wolfi Schlick’s tuba, Neil Vaggers’ trombone, Herbert Schneider ‘s drums, sitar and tabla, Mirjam Stutzmann’s accordion, and Martina Taubenberger’s clarinet, German flute, and sax - and a whole host of choir singers (including Max Amling, Florian a. Betz, Klaus Erich Dietl, Moni Kliche, Katharina Wilczek, Tobias Wullert ) on the album closer Up In Arms. All songs were produced by Fabian Zweck and Stefan Dorner, except RAIN IS OVERRATED. Colin Djukic who already contributed to beißpony's debut album, produced this song.

More detailled information about beißpony and BEASTS AND LONERS
Four years after their celebrated debut BRUSH YOUR TEETH on Chicks On Speed Records, beißpony are now releasing their follow-up album BEASTS AND LONERS.Those intervening years have seen numerous new developments for the band – from their invitation to SXSW in Austin (TX, USA), to the INTERNATIONAL SHORTFILM FESTIVAL in Oberhausen, to exciting solo ventures such as Stephanie Müller’s A DUET OF AMPLIFIED SEWING MACHINES tour with Lisa S. Caneiro in Indonesia, or Laura Theis’ solo release BADASS SNOW WHITE in the UK. Further highlights include music compositions for a collaboration with Wolfgang Müller (DIE TÖDLICHE DORIS) and for a radio play written by nobel prize winner Elfriede Jelinek. Thanks to the Munich based artist and cinematographer Klaus Erich Dietl, they also had the chance to become part of a feature film production. For OUR MOUTH – THE ULTIMATE PRISON they composed music and developed the set and costume design. Recently the feature was premiered at the Munich based LENBACHAUS. The follow-up is already in the making.In the midst of all these exciting new adventures, beißpony started their own label RAGREC. It was in 2016 during a vibrant exchange with artists from all over the globe. About 35 artists located in Germany, Hawaii, Japan, South Africa, UK and the Ukraine shared their ideas on ALLIGATOR GOZAIMASU. It is an intriguing, multi-facetted piece of work. Most of the songs are based on a public recording session at the IMPORT EXPORT, an underground venue located in the heart of Munich. People of all ages and different backgrounds - queer activists, young refugees and artists such as German filmmaker Doris Dörrie - took part.ALLIGATOR GOZAIMASU definitely left it's mark on the upcoming beißpony album. BEASTS AND LONERS is crossing all separators with a fierce love for complexity and no fear of life's dissonances.BEASTS AND LONERS is an album showcasing exciting collaborations and international exchange, which is not surprising considering its fascinating genesis:In 2014, Munich-based Stephanie Müller and Oxford-based Laura Theis were invited to develop an experimental piece of musical theatre during the walpurgis theater’s Feniks Festival Artist Residency in Mortsel, Belgium.Their performance was originally based on a pamphlet of Theis’ poems and short stories entitled ‘Beasts and Loners’, yet from this it grew and morphed into a mixed media composition that incorporated a whole array of local influences including an encounter with the SPACE LADY (La Junta, Colorado, USA) and a trip to a spoken word theatre adaptation of the famous RUMBLE IN THE JUNGLE boxing match. The exchange with fellow artist-in-residence Mikio Saito (Sapporo, Japan) even led to an extensive cultural exchange between the underground scenes in Munich and Sapporo.From this, the songs developed further. BEASTS AND LONERS is an album that has its unique strength in collaboration and beißpony have managed to assemble a very exciting array of guest musicians and performers.Musically, it is even more versatile than its predecessor: The songs feature Michael Krogmann’s double bass, Martin Majewski’s trumpet, Josip Pavlov’s guitar, Wolfi Schlick’s tuba, Neil Vaggers’ trombone, Herbert Schneider ‘s drums, sitar and tabla, Mirjam Stutzmann’s accordion, and Martina Taubenberger’s clarinet, German flute, and sax - and a whole host of choir singers (including Max Amling, Florian a. Betz, Klaus Erich Dietl, Moni Kliche, Katharina Wilczek, Tobias Wullert ) on the album closer Up In Arms.And with every new track the listener can tell that beißpony and their producers Fabian Zweck and Stefan Dorner (Rain Is Overrated is guest produced by Colin Djukic) are not afraid to experiment. Most of the songs were recorded at the MEDIENDIENST LEISTUNGSHÖLLE and at the KAFE KULT in Munich. They feature an eclectic variety of styles ranging from spoken word (e.g. the psychedelic Kraut piece Shadow Companion or the jazzy Japanese Oto-Hime) to the heavy My Abstraction Capability Equals Zero to the 60ies pop of the album’s opener Lord of the Wings to name but a few. Some songs are stripped down, lo-fi and rough, some are opulent, there is a-capella singing and animal noises generated by human voices.BEASTS AND LONERS rewards the listener for paying close attention because there is a lot going on between the lines. In a delicate and humorous way the album addresses and communicates the rough and uncanny aspects of life.Songs like Ambroxol, Malt & Heavy Beats, More Excuse than Escape may appear in the deceptive guise of a jaunty tune, only to reveal bitingly sharp lyrics that question society’s double standards, growing up in an alienating, bigoted social environment full of petit bourgeois reservations, or offer a disenchanted look at what drives people to futile workaholism.Lord of the Wings, written from the point of view of a ruthless wing man, takes an ironic dig at the misogynist world views inherent in the Pick Up Artist community. Identities are not fixed, they can be played with - Never Seen A Movie That Doesn’t Star Bruce Willis recounts the unlikely love affair between a wrestler and a librarian, and the gender-bent Rumble is completely made up from original quotes by the boxers Muhammad Ali and George Foreman.BEASTS AND LONERS is an album unafraid of complexity and in-between spaces, of looking behind facades. And especially the words to Shadow Companion, based on a poem by Jewish German language poet Mascha Kaléko who managed to emigrate to the US in 1938, seem very apt and poignant for the experience many refugees have to go through in our current times: “Do not say mine, everything is on loan … make your home but keep the suitcase on hand … take your own shadow for a companion”.Like Shadow Companion also the album's closer is based on poetry. Up In Arms derives from a tanka (Japanese poem consisting of 31 syllables) Stephanie found at the Sapporo based RETRO SPACE. It was written by the owner of the space, Kazutaka Saka. Back in his early twenties he was involved in the 1960ies protest movement. In his poem he is questioning whether he and his fellows will have any chance to inspire further generations. Saka was a friend of Etsuko Takano, a Japanese activist who committed suicide in the late 1960ies. Based on Saka's poem and on excerpts from Etsuko Takano’s suicide note, beißpony wrote a a very quiet, delicate resistance song: “Tomorrow is another day / because I believe it / I set up the barricades /How much I'm passionate / to whom should I tell?”BEASTS AND LONERS is an album for everyone who is ready to take off the blinkers and to explore new boulevards of thoughts. It is impossible to reduce the richness of this album to a single theme. Nobody is just one thing (just a beast, just a loner). The songs encourage the listeners to have a closer look and to dig deeper into complex questions. The album is a work under construction and therefore doesn’t offer any ready-made solutions, but rather encourages independent thought and a share in the wonderings of beißpony’s minds. *****UPDATE********Trouble with Card Payment?

<p>In March 2017, UK singer/songwriter David Nathan teamed up with the production team of songwriters and musicians, Aritra B and Rajesh Ranjan Singh to create two tracks for a planned EP.  The first session was magical and led to the creation of (Echoes Of) Shambhala, inspired by David's writing about a 12th century Nepalese Buddhist monk as part of a works-in-progress book on past lives... </p>

Ruby James - ""You have no idea how that piece affected me. Tears rolled down my face within first few bars then my body wanted me to go mediation mode. So I did. The imagery used touched me so much. I thank you for your music. I felt a strong healing from this and look forward to hearing and experiencing more"" Yogi Bowie Blackmon - ""Just a thought: What about tracking a few people's blood pressure before, during, and after listening to this music ... just to see. I swear, I feel mine change, dropping, leveling out nicely! I feel it in my body, in my bones, the chakras, in my aura, my spirit.""Freda Payne (recording artist) - ""Very lovely, very pleasant and meditative nice music to do yoga by.

They play their concerts in T-shirts and hand me downs.  We are a class at Indiana University crowdfunding so that these kids can hopefully get uniforms and new instruments. The band class, directed by David Ebersole, can only have 70 members because they only have that many instruments. Many hopeful musicians were turned away. Crispus Attucks HS is a historical school, a place where once whites sent only blacks to.
Help give them a sense of pride. They sound great and want to look great too! You have a chance to make a tangible impact.
   What We Need & What You Get Break it down for folks in more detail:  100 uniforms. Roughly $500 a piece (for quality uniforms) = $50,000. Once we pass 50K we want another 50K for new instruments in addition to the uniforms. A total of $100,000. We have to make sure we get enough uniforms for high school students of different sizes. When we reach our goal we will film a thank you show that you can attend in-person or watch online. If we don't reach our goal we will use the money to get as many uniforms as possible, possibly getting lower quality jackets, pants, hats, etc. or new instruments    The Impact Your donation will give the kids a chance to look as good as some of the other high school bands in the state, but more importantly it will show these kids that someone cares.  They will look as great as they sound. They will preform better at competitions because they will look as professional as their competition. The band can expand and let in others who were denied because of a lack of resources.    Risks & Challenges  The only obstacle is awareness. We will pursue a heavy social media campaign and reach out to local news stations to run stories.  We already have verbal commitment from some potential big donors.

It's population, once around 25,000, now sits at 7,000. Much of the historic architecture in the downtown area has been demolished, or is falling apart. There is a building in the heart of the downtown district that is crying out to be saved. This building known as '500 Donner Ave.' was a former bank, in Beaux Arts style.

<h2><i>Hello friends - Please join me on a journey to connect people in a positive way through music,art,and live performance.</i></h2>
<div><div><div><div><div><div>
<h3>As many of you may know, I have been playing music since<span> I was a small child. My father was a talented blues guitarist and vocalist,my mother a absolute lover of music, and a talented dancer, my stepfather a drummer, and my step brother a bassist. These four people were a big influence on my love of music and my desire to perform. My bliss led me to San Francisco at age 19, where I joined my step-brother Seth, and continued to study music, playing and performing with many different original projects. At the age of 24 I was invited by a Czech composer/bassist to travel with him back to Prague, where I stayed for five years. While living in Prague, I recorded with many different artists/singer songwriters, and started a movement tied to the Hip Hop, Funk, and Jazz sounds that I grew up with, leading to the formation of a very successful group named Plazma. Plazma was offered a record deal from Faust Records in Prague. The album featured some of Czech's best musicians and producers, as well as a very special American guest, Gary Lucas (of Captain Beefheart Fame). This group was featured on Radio 1 Praha, as well as on live TV. I also did quite bit of touring with a reggae group called Hermakuti led by French African bassist Djei Gogo (United Flavor). While in Europe, I toured Czech, Slovakia, Amsterdam, France, Spain, Germany, and Poland. I came back to NY in 2001, and have been playing and recording with groups and other artists ever since.</span>
</h3>
<h3>For the past six months I have been working on an EP made up of four songs that I feel strongly are a true representation of my abilities, and will lead to a major shift for me as an artist to make more substantial connections to the world of music and to those people who respect, work and contribute to that world.  So far pre-production (arrangements and bare bones) is complete, and I have completed my drum tracks, bass and keyboard parts for all 4 songs. Our projected release date is the Spring of 2016.Unfortunately, I have been unable to continue this project due to lack of funds- and this is where I need your help!</h3>
<h3>This particular project needs backers - people who can contribute monetarily to ""the Big Picture"" and also see themselves as part of a movement. My goal is to raise $5,500 which will cover the costs of paying for studio time and the musicians needed to finish recording, my lead vocal and backup vocals, guitar parts, string and horn section, and more percussion on my part. Most of the musicians who are playing on this recording are friends who will accept a small but respectable amount of money for each track, however, some of these musicians are hired hands and may need more to accept the challenge. Once we have what we need as far as recorded tracks, we have to mix the tracks and then the EP must be mastered. The mastering and production of approximately 500 CDs with jackets alone will cost between $1,000 to $1,500. I also have included the cost of paying the musicians to do two EP release performances.  The price of promotion and paying a publicist has not been factored in to my monetary goal as of yet.</h3>
<h3>Please give whatever you feel comfortable giving. No donation is too small. Regardless of whether I reach my goal or not, I will be able to use whatever you have contributed towards the completion of the EP. And don’t forget - your donations and input will be rewarded! You will receive perks such as free CD's, special performances, free concert tickets, special thank you’ s on CD jackets and more.  There will be videos/updates to all contributors no matter the amount, who wish to be kept current on progress of this project. The music being made with your donation will resonate with everyone who gets involved.</h3>
<h3>This project is meant to be a bridge for me to establish myself as a viable artist, one who is able to sustain myself as a full time musician. I believe that music is the ""Great Connector” - connecting people of all ethnicities, creeds, colors, ages, sexual orientations,religions and cultures. I feel that isolation from the proper love, affection, and guidance, are the reasons for most of the killing and heartache that happen here and abroad. That is why I feel that connecting through any art form (especially now!) is the key to minimizing so much of the suffering that we go through as part of the human race. I truly believe that there is no one that can deny the power of a beautiful piece of art including music, dance, photography, writing, film, architecture, or any other artistic discipline for that matter. My medium is music. This is the way I feel I can give the most to others and connect to them in a very special and deep way.</h3>
<h3>Thank you for giving me the opportunity to reach out to you and hope you will help me by being part of what I feel I am meant to share with this world. Your contribution will help me meet these goals, and I will be forever grateful.</h3>

<p>By Simm Gottesman:</p>
<p>My friend, touring and recording artist, <i><b>Elaine Silver</b></i> is sharing her healing music ministry and has asked me to assist her with this fundraising campaign.  My very talented husband, <i><b>Doug Tessler,</b></i> often accompanies her on clarinet and flutes when she performs locally, in South Florida.<span>  We also have put her on our YouTube channel and recorded her Indiegogo video, seen below.</span></p>
<p><span> Here is her story in her own words, from <i><b>Elaine Silver:</b></i></span></p>
<p>Greetings from Florida everyone!  <br/></p>
<p>I have been a full time musician since 1979 and have released many recordings over the years.  For the past decade or so, my career has moved into more of an actual ministry, as I have been involved with metaphysics and spirituality since the 80's.  I often fill in for ministers at Unity, Centers for Spiritual Living, Unitarian Societies and other progressive centers on Sunday mornings.  I also present secular music programs and workshops for all ages at schools, libraries, museums, parks, parties and senior centers, as well as kirtan and satsang at yoga studios.  (Yoga has been a passion of mine since the 70's!)<br/></p>
<p>It has been a labor of love and joy to do this, AND it hasn't always been easy.  This path I have chosen has had many twists and turns, and luckily for me, when I am in a ""dark night of the soul,"" I often do my best songwriting and creating.  This is uplifting for me as well, and then I get to share these co-creations on my CDs and in programs designed to open the heart and mind.  I feel so blessed to be able to do this as my life's work, and I am grateful.  :)<br/></p>
<p>Now I am very happy to announce that my next CD (#19!), ""The Only Real Power,"" is about to be released.  I have accumulated many expenses that need to be addressed, and this is where your financial support is requested, needed and very much appreciated.  I still have to fund the pressing and printing of the project, pay my artist, pay royalties for the 4 songs that I did not write, register the songs, promote the CD and find distribution!  WHEW!  <br/></p>
<p>Your assistance, of any amount is GREATLY accepted and appreciated.  And there are some sweet perks for contributing here on Indiegogo.com.</p>
<p>Here is a sample of one of my newest original songs ""It's About Love,"" performed with Doug Tessler on clarinet:<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><a href=""https://youtu.be/bgADPEOxk7s"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><br/></a></b></p>

My friend, touring and recording artist, Elaine Silver is sharing her healing music ministry and has asked me to assist her with this fundraising campaign.  My very talented husband, Doug Tessler, often accompanies her on clarinet and flutes when she performs locally, in South Florida.  We also have put her on our YouTube channel and recorded her Indiegogo video, seen below.
 Here is her story in her own words, from Elaine Silver:
Greetings from Florida everyone!  
I have been a full time musician since 1979 and have released many recordings over the years.  For the past decade or so, my career has moved into more of an actual ministry, as I have been involved with metaphysics and spirituality since the 80's.  I often fill in for ministers at Unity, Centers for Spiritual Living, Unitarian Societies and other progressive centers on Sunday mornings.  I also present secular music programs and workshops for all ages at schools, libraries, museums, parks, parties and senior centers, as well as kirtan and satsang at yoga studios.  (Yoga has been a passion of mine since the 70's!)
It has been a labor of love and joy to do this, AND it hasn't always been easy.  This path I have chosen has had many twists and turns, and luckily for me, when I am in a ""dark night of the soul,"" I often do my best songwriting and creating.  This is uplifting for me as well, and then I get to share these co-creations on my CDs and in programs designed to open the heart and mind.  I feel so blessed to be able to do this as my life's work, and I am grateful.  :)
Now I am very happy to announce that my next CD (#19!), ""The Only Real Power,"" is about to be released.  I have accumulated many expenses that need to be addressed, and this is where your financial support is requested, needed and very much appreciated.  I still have to fund the pressing and printing of the project, pay my artist, pay royalties for the 4 songs that I did not write, register the songs, promote the CD and find distribution!  WHEW!  
Your assistance, of any amount is GREATLY accepted and appreciated.  And there are some sweet perks for contributing here on Indiegogo.com.
Here is a sample of one of my newest original songs ""It's About Love,"" performed with Doug Tessler on clarinet:

  The Impact  Your contribution makes it possible for Elaine to continue offering her healing music to many communities, including yours !   Her project is not only valuable to you, But, we all know how kindness and loving thoughts through music, helps everyone on our planet and can transform our world.  Combine these thoughts with setting powerful Intentions, and we can have ""A New World"" that works for everyone!
Blessings and much appreciation to you for taking the ride with me!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p></p>
<p>The
entire universe was built on sound, vibration, or “the Word”… </p>
<p>We
humans are made up of 30 trillion cells, all dancing to a sea of creative
vibration. What we vibrate, we literally become.

<p><span>This

<p>I
started singing and performing when I was a little boy. My imagination was
huge. All the world was a beautiful dream. I sang and danced on stage
and basked in the wonder of playing pretend.</p>
<p>When
I became an adult, the world around me got bigger and I got smaller. I
started seeing and feeling pain. My simple faith and beliefs were
tested. I was scared. I needed to uncover the mystery of what life
really was.</p>
<p>I
started recognizing the stars and the moon. Spiritual books started
falling off the shelf in front of me. I began to understand the infinite
nature of all there was. I was finding lasting joy, and truth, and peace
in the idea that all of us are the same, that we come from the same place, and
we’ll return there as well. . . that we are safe, protected, guided, and Loved
unconditionally. </p>
<p>I
discovered many great teachers, and paths, and practices. And then I discovered Kundalini Yoga and Meditation . . .  I’ll never forget my very first class that would
define the rest of my life. The moment we began to chant mantra it was as if I
had come home. Everything finally made sense. </p>
<p>This
was how I would use my voice . .  . To heal, to teach, to uplift, to

</div></div>","Never give up on your dreams


I am a passionate singer from Podgorica, the capital of a small and beautiful country called Montenegro. I’ve been in the music industry for 15 years and through various performances, including festivals, released singles and one album in my native language, my voice has been recognized as one of the best in my country.My first album was released back in 2008 and in 2012 I released a single “Misbehave”, hitting the Top 10 chart of MTV Adria. The time for my second album ""Determination"" has finally arrived.


 
What is Determination?

""Determination"" sums up everything I've been going through in a completely new fashion. The songs are all in English, which gives my story a chance to be heard and understood on a wider scale. The songs are personal, passionate, free of shackles and bound to the truth. They sing of ups and downs, but also of victories over temptations and hardships...Hopefully, it's that time for my dreams to become a reality.

Beats, lyrics and production of two songs are finished, but I need your help to complete and release the whole album. In other words, there are seven more songs to go, plus all the other components which are included in a production of such a project. If you are asking yourself why you should be involved, just keep reading, the lyrics to my cover song say it all.



 This is a perfect time to discover the ""wild beauty""!
If you’ve never heard of my country, perhaps places such as Aman Sveti Stefan luxurious resort, Tara Canyon or Kotor would help. Long story short, Montenegro, unique for its diversity, both magnificent and unusual, is a country of the ultimate “wild” beauty, and if you’ve never seen it, this just might be the year to do so.  Guess what, I have the perk that is made for both music lovers and world travelers among you.
 


Some of the other perks...
Unique branded t-shirts which will be produced in limited number only for the contributors.




 Album you will love :)

<h3>The story about Kartolina</h3>
<p>Klapa Kartolina is an A Cappella vocal group that performs and promotes Klapa singing; which is a multipart singing tradition from the region of Dalmatia, in Croatia, and it is inscribed with UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. The word Klapa translates from Croatian as “a group of friends”, and Kartolina meaning “a postcard”. The group is based in Windsor, Ontario, Canada and is affiliated with St. Francis of Assisi Croatian Catholic Parish. Klapa Kartolina was founded in 2013 and has performed in Canada and Croatia. Klapa Kartolina is a registered Not-for-profit organization in Canada.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>With great excitement and pride, Klapa Kartolina is announcing that they are working on their debut album, which will be the first Klapa project ever made in this area. For this purpose, Klapa Kartolina is raising funds to record and produce the album. To accomplish this fundraising objective, Klapa Kartolina is offering sponsorships to businesses and individuals and will publish a twelve page, 11x17 inch calendar for 2017. The calendar features fine art photos of Klapa Kartolina taken in Croatia during their tour in 2016, and from their concerts, accompanied by the lyrics of the songs from their repertoire (click on thumbnails below the featured image to preview). The members wear traditional folk outfits from the city of Split, Croatia. This is a tribute to Klapa music and to its homeland. The calendar will be released and sent by mail after the fundraising campaign has ended, on December 19th, 2016.</p>
<p>The following sponsorship levels to businesses and individuals are offered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bronze sponsorship: For $100, you’ll receive a Klapa Kartolina 2017 Calendar and a beautiful, personalized 10x8 THANK YOU photo card in High Resolution of Klapa Kartolina taken in Split, Croatia, ready to be framed. </li>
<li>Silver sponsorship: For $300, you will receive ALL of the above PLUS you will get two tickets to Klapa Kartolina’s annual concert in February, 2017 and your name (or business name) will be printed on the calendar as a sponsor.</li>
<li>Gold sponsorship: For $600, you will receive ALL of the above PLUS Klapa Kartolina will come to perform songs from their repertoire at your event or event of your choice. The event must be in the Windsor/Detroit area, or traveling expenses will also apply.</li>
</ul>
<p>All the sponsors will be mentioned and thanked at our annual concert in February, on our website and social media pages, and will receive the album once it is released.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This will be the first Klapa album ever recorded and produced in this area.  Klapa Kartolina has already organized a very first Klapa concert in Windsor in 2015, at the Art Gallery of Windsor, which was a great success. Klapa Kartolina was founded in 2013 and has performed in Canada and Croatia. The group has performed in 2016 on several, prominent concerts of Klapa music in Croatia, most notably Festival Dalmatinskih Klapa Omiš, as a guest performer.</p>
<p>Klapa Kartolina is a registered not-for-profit organization in Canada, dedicated to promote Klapa singing and Croatian culture. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We plan to record and release our album in 2017/2018. Scheduling recording time is challenging and getting all of our individual schedules synchronized is an even bigger challenge! What keeps us motivated is the end product we can't wait for you to hear, as well as your support and encouragement.</p>

<div>So here we are.  It's more or less happened.  I tour.  A lot.  And I love it.  However, I don't record and produce my own music due to the lack of financial support and time.  I hope to change that as I continue down the path as a dedicated full-time musician.  <span style=""background-color: initial;"">So it's time to turn to Indiegogo to cultivate support for wrapping up my solo album.  Platforms like this have evolved to become a critical and necessary tool to fund all the layers that go into an album.  These days it's generally the go-to-option for making a record independently and paying everyone involved in the process.  </span>
</div>
<div>My full length album is in it's final stage and I'm super excited and equally vulnerable to unveil it.  However, I've made a resolution to follow in Bowie's legacy of fearless artistry to reveal more of my deep and often hidden space-conscious.  So I'm committing to sharing it.  Many of the arrangements are older refreshed works that I recorded at home while others are hot off the press.</div>
<div>Your contributions will help me achieve paying everyone that has been involved with the creative process and also printing CDs.  I.E. Musicians, a studio engineer, mixing/mastering engineer, and printing &amp; an online digital distribution company. </div>
<div>Here's the monetary breakdown:</div>
<div>- $1000 for Mastering and Mixing </div>

 The DIY event organization that puts on the annual festival works year round helping bands from all over the country, and in some situations, all over the world 
In the past 3 years Memphis Punk Promotions has hosted for over 250 bands including booking, promoting, housing, and feeding bands on the road for free.
 2015 MPRFEST 3 included 46 bands and 10 comedians from all over the country, all bands' guarantees and venue overheads were met with a total of $5 in the end profit. 
By donating to help MPP reach the goal of $10,000 it will allow for booking of larger bill bands to pull more of the country into Memphis to experience our city and music community. 
     Booking Bigger Bands
 Booking is a complicated and sometimes expensive world.  Most bands that have played MPP shows or previous festivals agreed to do so by door deal which is a major risk for bands touring from a long distance.
 Having money to fall back on is always smart in a safe investments, but the owner who puts together the festival and local shows works a normal job like anyone else. You aren't donating to a CEO.
 When it comes to booking a band that is on a largely known label, you're instantly looking at anywhere between $2,500 and $20,000. 
    The Outcome
 Locals of Memphis young and old agree that MPR Fest is a great thing for the city and it's music community.   The festival and shows that happen year round include bands on their first show to ones that don't match the genre of the others giving everyone a chance to meet new people to network and become friends with. 
 The promotion of the festival exceeds most events with it's recognizable name inviting all sorts of people to find out there is still punk rock and live music happening in the city.
 Many memories and friendships to made and the most important part is including an all ages crowd to certain shows to keep the music alive in the youth! 
    Risks & Challenges Risks are always there when booking bands especially without a big bank account to fall back on.  By donating you are helping secure the event so the owner who works year round for free to help bands doesn't have to go in debt over anything that could cause the festival to lose money.
 Another thing about booking large bill bands is that most of them sadly will not take you seriously unless you are able to make a deposit up front which MPP does not have the funds to do. 
    Other Ways You Can Help When the Festival ticket links go live, tell a friend!   Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Text, or any other form of social media can go a long way with a few clicks, isn't the future great?!

<b>ALL THE LITTLE THINGS</b><br/>
</div>I am excited to introduce to you the strongest album of my career: ""All the Little Things""!

These pieces of the process are mission critical and the album won't float well without them. If the whole goal is not met, each of these items can be addressed individually in priority order.

Este proyecto nace de una pasión. Pasión por la música
electrónica pero sobre todo passion por la gente detrás de la música. Pasión
por lo que esta fuera de las lineas, fuera de lo comercial. Pasión por lo
alternativo, por la contra cultura. Pasión por buscar y descubrir talentos.
También una pasión por viajar y recorrer el mundo. Pasión por este continente
que es Sudamérica tan rico en artistas, ideas y proyectos.

ESSENTIA es un autentico road trip atravesando 5 países desde Lima, Perú pasando por Chile, Argentina, Uruguay & Brasil con un objetivo: Irnos a la búsqueda de la música electrónica más pura, a la búsqueda de toda esta gente y artistas que dedican su vida a hacernos felices haciendonos bailar. Djs, productores, músicos,  pero también dueños de club, de sellos discográficos, de programas de radio, ingenieros de sonido, promotores... Todos que comparten esta misma pasión pura por la música y la contra cultura. La música como placer, como regalo no como negocio.
Nuestra idea de hacer este documental, llegó poco
tiempo después de crear DATEXEUS primera revista online dedicada a las músicas
electrónicas y dedicada a la escena limeña. Cobertura de eventos, entrevistas,
fotografía, video, podcasts, agenda de eventos, la alimentamos cada día con
mucho cariño y mucha dedicación y al cumplir ahora un año de existencia, vimos
nuestro publico y seguidores crecer cada vez más. 
NUESTRA REVISTA ONLINE COMO PLATAFORMA DE DIFUSIÓNDATEXEUS será, durante todo el
proceso de nuestro viaje nuestra plataforma para compartir nuestras aventuras y
encuentros musicales a través de publicaciones, fotos y videos para que todos
nuestros seguidores puedan seguir nuestros pasos durante
nuestra gran odisea. Queremos que el documental también se pueda vivir desde el contenido que iremos compartiendo cada día. queremos así, poder tener una verdadera comunicación con nuestro público. Llevarlos de viaje con nosotros. La importancia de tener una plataforma de seguimiento nos
permitirá compartir a diario sobre todos estos artistas que iremos conociendo y permitir
a nuestros seguidores de aprender de ellos pero también permitirles de acceder
a sus proyectos, escuchar y adquirir su música difundiendo de esta manera su
arte y mensaje.También queremos que la plataforma funcione como intercambios, vamos a estar de rutas por diferentes países y vamos a necesitar todas las conexiones posibles con los artistas locales. Queremos que los artistas nos puedan contactar para así organizar encuentros más espontáneos. NUESTRO OBJECTIVOTenemos varios objectivos en la mente, destinaciones definidas pero es muy importante también para nosotros de dejar fluir las cosas y los encuentros. Dejar que la vida ocurra. Sabemos que también nos encontraremos con muchas preguntas y contradicciones. Porque unos países o ciudades están más desarrolladas que otras al nivel musical?
Tiene que ver con su historia? Sus orígenes? Como se educa a los jóvenes a la música?
Hay estructuras? Gente con proyectos educativos para las nuevas generaciones de
artistas? Como va la escena Underground? Porque artistas europeos decidieron cruzar
el océano para venir a vivir a Sudamérica? Hay más oportunidades? Porque muchos
artistas locales deciden mudarse a Europa? Cuales son las dificultades con cuales
se confrontan los artistas en estos diferentes países? Como la escena se podría
mejorar? Estas preguntas son partes de las que llevaremos con nosotros y a las cuales
intentaremos responder.UN DOCUMENTAL ""LOW BUDGET"", INTIMO Y VERDADERO Queremos realizar un documental low budget, un van, un
equipo de dos artistas apasionados, Rodrigo y Marilou, sus dos cámara, sus dos miradas, un micrófono, unas luces y una computadora para la edición y publicaciçon del contenido. Queremos un documental intimo, humano y verdadero. Queremos conocer
a los actores auténticos de la escena electronica de cada uno de estos 5 países
muy diferentes entre ellos. Intentar entender las orígenes de la escena
electronica según su entorno social, histórico y económico.El formato final sera un documental largometraje (entre
1h30 y dos horas de duración) que sera accessible por internet en streaming pero también disponible
en DVD. La realización de este documental representa un viaje de larga duración a través de todo un continente. Por eso viajaremos en una casa / nave ""especial"" / oficina nos permitirá trasladarnos por carreteras y cruzar fronteras y también que nos permitirá tener un hogar móvil para ahorrar gastos de alojamiento y tener un espacio de trabajo. UNA BANDA SONORA ÚNICA & ORIGINALComo queremos darle una importancia considerable a todos los artistas que iremos conociendo durante la realización del documental, decidimos que ellos compondrán la banda sonora original del documental. Cada transición musical tendrá entonces su historia y creamos una pieza sonora única, un viaje musical sin fronteras. PARA QUE INVERTIR EN NUESTRO PROYECTO?Con tu colaboración apoyas antes de todo un propósito. El impacto de un trabajo documental global sobre la escena electrónica en estos 5 país podría ser muy positivo sobre la escena mundial. Con tu colaboración apoyas artistas. Puede despertar consciencias y crear oportunidades muy buenas para los artistas. Todos los artistas que iremos conociendo durante el viaje serán promocionado y participarán a la composición de la banda sonora del documental. Hay tantos artistas que descubrir y dar de conocer, tantos opiniones que cuentan y merecen ser escuchadas. La escena esta en plena efervescencia en este continente. Es su momento!QUE HAREMOS CON LO QUE RECIBIMOS?Primero, lo que necesitamos es asumir todos los gastos relacionados con la post-producción del documental:- Edición profesional de imagen & sonido- Mastering Digital (para los cines)- Titulos & Subtitulos Segundo, si nuestro proyecto recibe más inversión, podremos anticipar todos los gastos relacionados con la promoción del documental, su estreno, su comunicación y relación en prensa y con festivales en todo el mundo. Estamos consciente que todos no podemos apoyar de la misma manera, pero si te gusto el proyecto, compartirlo, hablar de ello a tus amigos o artistas que podrían ser interesados...  Es gratis y puede hacer mucho! :)-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ENGLISH-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT SOUTH AMERICA'S ELECTRONIC MUSIC SCENEhis project comes from our passion. Passion for
electronic music and, above all, (especially) for the artists behind the music.
Passion for underground cultures and counter-cultures. Passion to seek and find
new talents. This project also comes from our passion for travelling and
discovering the world, passion for South America, so rich in terms of artists,
ideas and projects.ESSENTIA is an authentic road trip across 5
countries. From Lima, Peru, we will travel through Chile, Argentina, Uruguay
and Brazil with one goal : meet those who dedicate their lives to make us
dance and feel good.  DJ’s, producers,
musicians, as well as club owners, labels managers, radios, sound engineers and
show promoters… We want to link up with all those who share the same
passion for music and counter-culture. Music as a pleasure and a gift, not as a
business.The

Nous avons déjà de nombreux objectifs et destinations bien définies mais il est très important pour nous de laisser se faire les choses et les rencontres naturellement. Laisser faire la vie. 
Bien sûr, nous serons confrontés à beaucoup de
questions et contradictions. Pourquoi certains pays ou villes sont plus
développés que d’autres au niveau musical? Cela vient t’il de leur histoire?
Leurs origines? Comment s’organise t’ils concernant l’éducation des jeunes
generations? Y’a t’il des structures adaptées? Comment va la scène
Underground? Pourquoi certains artistes européens décident de traverser l’océan
pour venir vivre ici, en Amérique du Sud? Plus d’opportunités? Et pourquoi au
contraire, beaucoup d’artistes locaux décident d’aller s’installer en Europe?
Quelles sont les principals difficultés auxquelles se confrontent les artistes
dans ces différents pays? Comment l’industrie pourrait s’améliorer? Ces
questions, nous les emmènerons avec nous et essaierons d’y répondre.

UN DOCUMENTAIRE ""LOW BUDGET"",  INTIME ET VÉRITABLE


Notre volonté est de realizer un documentaire à petit
budget: Un van, une équipe de deux passionnés, Marilou et Rodrigo et beaucoup,
beaucoup de kilomètres. Nous voulons réaliser un documentaire intime, humain et
vrai. Nous voulons connaître les acteurs authentiques du milieu de chacun des
cinq pays que nous visiterons. Tenter de comprendre les origines de l’industrie
électronique d’après  leur contexte
social, historique et économique. 


Le format final sera un documentaire long métrage qui
sera accesible sur internet et disponible dans format DVD plus complet. 

Notre projet de documentaire représente un voyage de plusieurs mois à travers tout un continent. C'est pour cela que nous voyagerons à bord d'une maison / véhicule / studio qui nous permettra de définir notre propre rythme de voyage, d'économiser les frais d'hébergement ainsi que d'avoir un lieu de travail mobile. 


UNE BANDE SON ORIGINALE ET UNIQUE
Notre volonté est de donner une importance considérable a tous les artistes que nous connaîtrons durant la réalisation du documentaire. C'est pour cela que nous avons décider que tous ces artistes composeront la bande son originale du documentaire. Chaque transition musicale aura donc son histoire. Nous créerons une oeuvre sonore unique, un voyage musicale sans frontières.
POURQUOI INVESTIR DANS NOTRE PROJET?

Grâce à votre collaboration, vous soutenez avant tout une intention. L'impact d'un travail documentaire profond sur la musique élctronique de ces 5 pays différents peut avoir un résultat très positif sur la scène musicale mondiale. Grâce a votre collaboration, vous soutenez aussi des artistes indépendants. Ce projet peut réveiller les consciences et créer de nombreuses opportunités pour les artistes. Tous les artistes que nous allons rencontrer durant le voyage auront tous un espace de promotion disponible sur notre webzine. Ils participeront également a la réalisation de la bande son du documentaire. Il ya tant d'artistes a découvrir et faire connaître. Tant de points de vue et d'opinion qui comptent et méritent d'être entendus. 
QU'ALLONS NOUS FAIRE AVEC CE QUE NOUS RECEVRONS?
Tout d'abord, nous devons assumer toutes les dépenses en relation avec la post production du documentaire:- Montage image & son professionnel- Mastering Digital (pour les salles de cinéma)- Titres et sous-titres
Puis, si nous avons la chance de recevoir plus d'investissement, nous pourrons donc anticiper les frais en relation avec la promotion du documentaire, ses débuts et sa communication (organisation des premières, contact avec les festivals du monde entier, relations presse etc...)
Nous sommes conscients que nous ne pouvons pas tous participer de la même manière mais si notre projet vous plaît et vous intéresse, vous pouvez le partager, en parlez avec vos amis ou artistes qui pourraient être intéressés... C'est gratuit et peut nous aider beaucoup!

<b>Composer,
Yann Ferlaak</b> has been a pioneer in electronic music
(specifically EBM) for the last fourteen years. Originally from Marseille,
France, he began writing under the group name of Ad Inferna. The group was
signed to major record label, Metal Blade Records. Yann took a hiatus writing
for the group, which at that time was writing metal music, and switched to
writing electronic music. He began writing for Ad Inferna again in 2000, and
wrote ten additional albums over the span of six years including <i>L’Empire des Sens</i> (2001), <i>Sexual Music for Sexual Mass</i> (2009), <i>Trance N Dance</i> (2009), <i>Heroine</i> (2010), <i>DSM</i> (2010), <i>There is No Cure</i>
(2011), <i>eXsangue</i> (2011), <i>Ultimum Omnium</i> (2012), <i>Im Mortelle</i> (2013), <i>Opus 7: Elevation</i> (2014). 
His music has been described as cutting edge, dark, extremely moving and
often is created as a concept or story album. <p></p>
<p>Additionally, Yann owns recording studio, Akamaradara Studio
and has been a sound engineer for numerous other bands. </p>

<b>Librettist,
Melissa Ferlaak</b> received her Master’s degree in Vocal
Performance from New England Conservatory of Music (2003) and Bachelor’s degree
in Music from the University of Wisconsin-River Falls (2001). She found success
writing and performing music of a hybrid of opera, symphonic and heavy metal
that took her across the globe on tours in Europe (tour and large festivals
such as Summer Breeze in Germany, Hoernerfest in Germany, Female Metal Voices
Festival in Belgium, Masters of Rock in Czech Republic and Dokken Fest in the
Netherlands), China (co-headlining tour), US (co-headlining tour), Mexico (tour
and festivals) and Canada (tour and festivals). The biggest draw was the
‘metalized’ performances of Mozart arias such as <i>Der Holle Rache</i> and <i>D’Oreste,
D’Ajace</i>.  She has written and
recorded seven full-length albums (Aesma Daeva (<i>The Eros of Frigid Beauty</i> (2002), <i>The New Athens Ethos</i> (2003), <i>Ex
Libris </i>(2005)), Visions of Atlantis (<i>Trinity</i>
(2007)), Echoterra (<i>Land of the Midnight
Sun</i> (2011)), MY Eternel (<i>Pursuit of a
Higher Throne</i> (2013) and Plague of Stars (<i>When Morning Came</i> (2014)). Melissa has also been a guest singer
with eleven other musical groups. Melissa and Yann together first wrote an
album of ambient music (akin to Enya) under the group name MY Eternel. <p></p>
<p> Classically she has
performed mostly in Minneapolis with Theatre Latte Da (also served as assistant
director on the production of <i>La Boheme</i>,
Thursday Musical, Coro!, Twin Cities Opera Scenes and the Schubert Club
Courtroom Concert Series. </p>
<p><b>Collectively,</b> Melissa
and Yann have written a total of 17 full-length albums selling over 50,000
copies worldwide. When deciding to embark on writing an opera, though the task
seemed daunting, they viewed it as writing essentially three albums of music
all within one concept; a task they have experience with for 25 years. </p>
