<p><strong>Short Project Summary - Keep Dancing in the Sun Memorial Relief Fund</strong></p>
<p>Contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust. Here are some things to do in this section:</p>
<ul>
<li>My name is Brian K. Hemphill. I'm a writer, music producer, lyricist, actor, published author, lecturer, and artistic coach. I also work as a project coordinator for a child abuse prevention education agency.</li>
<li>This campaign is important to me as a way to both promote the memory of a great friend and artist, while galvanizing community action around helping the victims of Hurricane Sandy. I want to promote the belief that Lené and I shared that art and music can promote awareness of vital causes and foster positive change. By giving away our song ""Keep Dancing in the Sun,"" which is one of the songs on a tribute album in memory of Lené Newkirk who passed away before the album was completed, we can demonstrate that music can be a tool to foster positive change. The Lené Newkirk Keep Dancing in the Sun Memorial Relief Project will demonstrate this philosophy.</li>
<li> For as little as $5.00, an individual can become a part of a great collective which can make a difference by improving the lives of victims of Hurricane Sandy. The target of $5,000 may seem small in comparison with the billions of dollars of destruction Sandy caused; however, this financial support will mean a world of difference to those families, individuals, and children receiving the financial support.</li>
<li>If you don't have a lot to contribute to this relief initiative, that's okay. Collectively, if people give what they can, the collective pool of even small donations can make a world of difference.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Breakdown of Perks and Incentrives</strong></p>
<p>I set a target goal of $5,000 to be raised in the memory of Lené Newkirk. One hundred percent of the proceeds will go to trusted disaster relief organizations like American Red Cross or Save the Children. Donating this money in the name of my friend will promote his vocal legacy and compassion, while providing aide to the disaster victims of Sandy.</p>
<ul>
<li>As this is a campaign to show that art can inspire community action, all the perks support the promotion of art. The first perk offered for a $5.00 contribution is a copy of ""Keep Dancing in the Sun,"" a song written to encourage perseverance and hope. An abundance of perseverance and hope is the disaster victims of Hurricane Sandy will need to recover.</li>
<li>For a contribution of $15.00, supporters receive a special download code to download an mp3 version of the album on CDBaby.com. The memorial album, called Tribute, was finally released in Oct. 2012 on the 8th anniversary of his passing. The album contains 11 amazing songs. Several of the songs deal with issues like child abuse, racism, nuclear proliferation, and other timely issues. Other songs push the boundaries of musical experimentation. One song, for example, features a blues vocals over African drums and a heavy metal guitar. From pop, to rock, to new age jazz, there's certainly an eclectic mix of music for music lovers to appreciate.</li>
<li>For $25.00, contributors receive a physical cd of Tribute.</li>
<li>For $80.00, contributors receive an autograph copy of this author's book entitled The Elements of Creative and Expressive Artistry: A Philosophy for Creating Everything Artistic. This 600-page all-artist guide discloses the 9 root elements and 36 branch elements that make all artistic works expressive. The book offers great insights to performing artists, visual artists, and writers alike.</li>
<li>For $120, contributors get a hardcopy autographed copy of The Elements of Creative and Expressive Artistry: A Philosophy for Creating Everything Artistic. (See description above.)</li>
<li>For $250, contributors will get a two-hour conference call to discuss any aspect of art they would like. For others who may not have a particular topic, artistic coach and author Brian K. Hemphill will provide an overview of his book The Elements of Creative and Expressive Artistry. This will certainly prompt inquiries for discussion.</li>
<li>For $500, contributors will be recognized by name in the physical CD case underneath the memorial dedication inscription to Lene Newkirk. Contributors will receive a physical CD copy of Tribute, containing 11 diverse and eclectic songs.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't need to explain the importance of supporting this campaign. Everyone worldwide has seen photographs and heard personal narratives of how Sandy affected so many individuals. As a native New Yorker from Staten Island which faced major devastation and as a current resident of New Jersey where southern coastal municipalities were annihilated, I know I have to take some action. I was inconvenienced by Hurricane Sandy with a lost of power, heat, and water for a few days. So many others lost everything. As an artist, I have the sensitivity to empathize with the victims. As an executive with a strong background in project management, I have the skills to execute this campaign. Although I'm optimistic that we'll reach our target, whatever monies are raised will go to support disaster relief organizations. </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If you cannot contribute with cash, you can certainly contribute through word of mouth support and using social media to spread the word about this campaign. And that’s all there is to it. We're all members of a worldwide community and must do what we can help. Whatever you can do to support this campaign is appreciated.</p>

<h2><strong>3 GRAND, 3 STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT, 3 WITCHES...</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>PLEASE SUPPORT THE WORK I FEEL I AM ON THIS PLANET TO MAKE.</strong></h3>
<p>Note: Donations over $500 will not be accepted…. Yes, this means you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>As most of you reading this will know</strong>, I dedicate much of my life to making theatre and am hugely passionate about the kind of theatre that I feel called to make.  Today I am reaching out with this fundraising campaign because I want to take a big, new step forward in the development of work with my company Rapid Descent.</p>
<p> No company that I know of is making the kind of theatre that I want to bring into being, and in order to do this I need to not only create ‘IT’, but also create how the hell I am going to make ‘IT’. Despite having a talented and dedicated cast for Tartuffe,  (my last show) I was unhappy with the show itself, and in the soul searching I have done since I have formed the belief that the kind of work I want to make needs time and money for development, and at this stage in my life as an artist I also need to spend time and money developing process, which I will then use to make future shows.</p>
<p> The other big and exciting step that I am taking is towards forming closer and more fruitful collaborations with other artists. I have always valued the contribution of other artists and I believe that collaboration is a vital key in the creation of the theatre I now dream of, so collaboration is a defining feature of the stages of development that I am inviting you to support today.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT ARE THE 3 STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT?</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>As a supporter of this project, you get to chose which stage your money goes towards. After you have made a donation I will send you an email to say thank you and ask if you would like to fund a particular stage of development. Those stages are-</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>1.WORKING WITH AARON PRISKORN</strong></p>
<p>The first stage of development is to work with Trumpet player/composer Aaron Priskorn. Aaron has been in both of the full-length shows that I have created here in San Francisco and is a truly gifted, classically trained trumpet player and composer. As well as playing live and composing for other instruments Aaron works with a loop station, which is an electronic device that enables him to layer the music that he plays live.  He and I have done some great work together so far and I am really excited to explore together further ways to create theatre that seamlessly combines live music with its other elements. For the first stage of development we will explore the creation of vocal scores performed by the cast, and begin our work creating some of the key theme tunes for Rapid Descent's Macbeth.</p>
<p>You can hear him in action at:  <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/aaron-priskorn"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://soundcloud.com/aaron-priskorn</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>2.WORKING WITH JONES WELSH</strong></p>
<p>The second stage of development will focus on working with Choreographer Jones Welsh. I met Jones when I was in London and he is a wonderful dancer and choreographer who’s work combines grace with strength and athleticism.  He works with an LA company called Diavolo Dance Theater who create incredible shows on moving set pieces. In this development stage he and I will devise methods of working together, mainly with a chorus of performers, exploring ways of working with chorus and text. I am really excited about the prospect of working with Jones. I feel that Macbeth will greatly benefit from having a choreographer AND a director and our working relationship is such that I am confident together we will create work (and methods of making it) that combine movement and text in profound and poetic ways.</p>
<p> You can see him in action at <a href=""http://www.nortoncenter.com/previous-seasons/1-the-newlin-hall-series/206-diavolo-dance-theater"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.nortoncenter.com/previous-seasons/1-the-newlin-hall-series/206-diavolo-dance-theater</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>3.COMBINING THE ELEMENTS</strong></p>
<p>In the third stage of development I will work with both Aaron and Jones and we will work on the scene between Macbeth and Lady Macbeth during which they kill King Duncan, and create a version that includes: live music, (both trumpet and vocal scores), movement (from Mac, Lady Mac and three witches who will be observing the scene),and Shakespeare’s text with it’s hair raising, pulse quickening poetry. We will create this scene to be a part of the future Rapid Descent production of Macbeth, planned for 2013.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>WHY WON’T YOU TELL ME HOW MUCH TO DONATE?</strong></p>
<p><strong>I haven’t told you how much to donate</strong> because I trust you to know the right amount for you to donate. If you believe in the project and want to donate, just sit still for a moment and think about what the right amount is for you to give. I believe that the right amount is one that will make us both feel happy, you will feel happy and generous to give it and I will be super happy and grateful to receive it. Please do not donate an amount that makes you feel unhappy for any reason. </p>
<p>All donations gratefully received, but DON’T FORGET the $500 limit. I would HATE to have to send you back your money because you thought the rules did not apply to you.....</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT HAPPENS IF THE CAMPAIGN DOESN’T REACH $3,000?</strong></p>
<p>If we don’t reach our goal with this fundraiser, we don’t get the money, and your donation will not be processed.</p>
<p><strong>CAN I SEND YOU A CHEQUE INSTEAD OF USING ONLINE PAYMENT?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, please feel free to do this if it makes you more comfortable. Make the cheque out to Megan Finlay and post it to 1707 Dolores St San Francisco CA 94110.</p>

There are still over 30 days in my campaign so any additional contributions would be incredibly appreciated as I have other transportation costs and materials to cover. The dye that I plan to use in my home studio alone costs $400 because it is pure, not synthetic.

THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN!!! And I look forward to sharing this with you!
Hi!  Thank you so much for taking a moment to check out my

<h3>Hello World,</h3>
<p> My name is Angela Jaramillo and I am an artist from the San Francisco Bay area, however due to my current adventure in life I am currently in the beautiful desert of Thermal, CA. In mid-2011 I decided to leave my job in the retail and mortgage industry to persue my dreams of being an artist and photographer. I realized life was too short to do what I thought others had expected of me instead of doing what I expected of myself. I asked myself many questions all to come to the same conclusion, that yes, I do beleive I can be successful and feel fulfilled in life by solely doing the things that I love and that continuously inspire me. Shortly after realizing this my whole world shifted. I went from off and on sadness and negativity to living a life that was beyond positive. The people that I started to attract were like minded and very inspirational. I started to share my work without fear and found people loved it and wanted to be a part of it. Co-workers, family and friends started to purchase my work and I found myself in my first Art show in San Francisco. This was all so unreal, I never knew what an impact shifting your frame of mind could have on life.</p>
<p> From the start of focusing on my art I never wanted to use the excuse of not having the ideal tools to keep me from trying, or any excuse for that matter. I take photos with a canon powershot S5is (far from professsional) and paint with whatever materials I can get my hands on. I am finding now, that I am reaching a new milestone of growth in my journey and need help to take my next leap. I am running into situations and jobs were my tools are no longer of my best interest to use. I am finally in need of a professional camera and more art materials. This is what brings me to my campaign, ""A Time to Grow"". I am reaching out to ask for the support to help me take this next leap. This is important to me because although I feel you can make do with what you have a persons creations can be limitless with the proper tools. A new camera would allow me to take my photography to the next level providing incredible images. More art supplies will allow me to create without limitations. My goal is to eventually reach a point in my career where I can travel, inspire, and help others through donating a percentage of my profit.</p>
<p>  I am in need of $2,000. $1,300, will get me the camera I need to take my photography to the next level and $560 will allow me to purchase enough supplies to create a larger inventory of work. And of course the rest of the funds will go back to indiegogo for allowing me to run this campaign. If I do not reach my goal the funds will still go towards whatever supplies I can get to continue growth.</p>
<p> If you would like to see my work you can visit <a href=""http://www.angelajaramillo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.angelajaramillo.com</a> or visit me on facebook at Angela Jaramillo Art and Photography. I greatly thank you in advance for taking the time to read about my campaign and considering donating.</p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My name is Zak Walters &amp; I started Sky City when I was 15 years old in Buffalo, NY. Since then I have been published in national magazines, front page news articles, blogs from around the world and I have created a following of over 5,000+ people (Classy Kids). Sky City Clothing is not just a clothing line, it is a social network and movement. On our website you can create your own profile, your own online store, earn points to win cool stuff and much more. My dream is to see Sky City as an international brand promoting creativity, following your dreams, innovation, and of course staying classy. Like everyone else in the world, I want to make a difference. But instead of sitting around saying that and following the norms of society; I'm actually going to take a stand and do something about it. I thought the best way to do this would be with a clothing line, as 
it creates a community and brings people together through artwork &amp; 
fashion.  I worked my entire High School career and rather than buying a car or going shopping, I put every penny and all of my heart and soul into starting my own business. Now it's on its way to the top, but I just need that push to get there.     #ambition<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Eventually once Sky City is on it's feet and in stores around the world,
 I'm going to use the community I have and funding I earn to fuel a whole empire of new projects I have in 
mind: <br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a
 hangout place for kids that allows them to unveil their creativity to 
the world through music and art.<br/>
</li>
<li>An entrepreneurship movement that engages everyone to innovate, create new ideas for the world, and making it a better place. This program will fund ideas that we investigate and see that they come true.</li>
<li>Nurture other small businesses created by teens and young adults from around the world. <br/>
</li>
<li>&amp; Much, much more. <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If I don't get the funding needed, I'm not giving up. This is MY dream and I think too many people lose faith in themselves and end up not doing what they want in life. I'm not letting that happen me, or any of the other people's lives that I affect in the process and result of this movement. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>

</div></div>","My Story
My name is Zak Walters & I started Sky City when I was 15 years old in Buffalo, NY. Since then I have been published in national magazines, front page news articles, blogs from around the world and I have created a following of over 5,000+ people (Classy Kids). Sky City Clothing is not just a clothing line, it is a social network and movement. On our website you can create your own profile, your own online store, earn points to win cool stuff and much more. My dream is to see Sky City as an international brand promoting creativity, following your dreams, innovation, and of course staying classy. Like everyone else in the world, I want to make a difference. But instead of sitting around saying that and following the norms of society; I'm actually going to take a stand and do something about it. I thought the best way to do this would be with a clothing line, as 
it creates a community and brings people together through artwork & 
fashion.  I worked my entire High School career and rather than buying a car or going shopping, I put every penny and all of my heart and soul into starting my own business. Now it's on its way to the top, but I just need that push to get there.     #ambition


The Impact
Eventually once Sky City is on it's feet and in stores around the world,
 I'm going to use the community I have and funding I earn to fuel a whole empire of new projects I have in 
mind: 

Creating a
 hangout place for kids that allows them to unveil their creativity to 
the world through music and art.

An entrepreneurship movement that engages everyone to innovate, create new ideas for the world, and making it a better place. This program will fund ideas that we investigate and see that they come true.
Nurture other small businesses created by teens and young adults from around the world. 

& Much, much more. 


If I don't get the funding needed, I'm not giving up. This is MY dream and I think too many people lose faith in themselves and end up not doing what they want in life. I'm not letting that happen me, or any of the other people's lives that I affect in the process and result of this movement.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Two emerging curators from Wisconsin, Sarah Anne Stolte and Katie Apsey, are raising funds to assist with organziation of the exhibition ""Air, Land, Seed"" opening in Venice, Italy during the vernissage of the Venice Biennale.</p>
<p>This exhibition will address global tensions between home and exile, drawing from the unique perspectives of Indigenous peoples of Native North America. Six contemporary artists engaging in the politicized mediums of printmaking and multi-media will produce works that question the displacement and diasporas that define our collective contemporary existence. This reappropriation of colonial markers - flags, boats and airwaves - subverts the control and militarization of Indigenous homelands. Through participatory live print actions, performance, exhibition, and dialogue, our exhibition will repurpose such potent icons.</p>
<p>The exhibition will be presented at The University of Venice Ca’ Foscari during the Vernissage of the Venice Biennale (May 29 to June 2, 2013) and will travel to 516 Arts, Albuquerque, New Mexico (June 29 to September 21, 2013)</p>
<p>Curated by a collaborative group of artists, art educators, and curators, this project is the seventh Indigenous exhibition at the Venice Biennale (1999-2011) and the fifth collaborative event with the University of Venice. </p>
<p>Curators include: Elisabetta Frasca, Nancy Marie Mithlo, Paul Baker Prindle and Sarah Anne Stolte</p>
<p>The following artists' works will be exhibited in Venice:</p>

Alongside commissions and client work I work on socially-focused documentary projects about issues relevant to my community. I've previously worked on <a href=""http://www.jendella.co.uk/new/projects/where-the-devil-wont-go/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a project about ex-gang members in South London called <i>Where The Devil Won't Go</i></a><i></i> which has been exhibited around London including the Bernie Grant Art Centre in Tottenham, and also created <a href=""http://www.jendella.co.uk/new/projects/our-skin/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a conceptual project about skin bleaching called <i>Our Skin</i></a><i></i>, which has been exhibited at the Arden &amp; Anstruther gallery in Sussex and the Brockton Collective in Toronto, Canada. My most recent project is <i>Young Motherhood</i>, and it addresses the realities being a young mother raising children in Britain.</p><h3><span style=""background-color: initial;"">About Young Motherhood</span></h3><h3><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;""></span></h3>
<p>I was inspired to start this project as I have friends who have had children at what society often deems to be ""too young"". I have witnessed their efforts in raising their children as well as working towards their own personal goals and have been inspired by their diligence and focus, as well as their persistence in overcoming challenges they face. However, in the mainstream consciousness this picture of the hard-working young mother is absent, and often the conversation about ""teen pregnancy"" or young motherhood revolves around ""irresponsible"" young girls, who are seen as promiscuous or opportunistic – opening their legs for council flats and handouts from the government. You will find ""irresponsible"" mothers at any age, but the tiny percentage of younger mothers who may not be making good decisions for them or their children has been used time and again to shame and belittle entire generations of young women playing one of the most important roles in our society. Not only is this ridiculous stereotype unfair, but the widespread public perception affects the real lives of young women who are working tirelessly to raise their children well, as well as continue in their education, career or other goals. This sensationalist perspective sells papers but it also misinforms policy makers and MPs, with young mothers being blamed for everything from the welfare deficit and housing shortage to urban crime and all other societal ills.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/649928/files/20140615004102-YMJadePrev-6637.jpg?1402818062"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p> <p></p> <p> </p><h3>
</h3><p>Unlike common documentary photographic practices I do not wish to co-opt the stories of the ""marginalised"" or ""disadvantaged"". The most important part of this project was travelling around the UK to photograph and interview women (27 in total) who are, or have been, young mothers – that is women who have given birth to children in their early twenties or below – to hear directly from them what their experiences have been raising their children. I see myself as using my skills to amplify their voices in the hopes that their experiences can intelligently inform discussion and start a much-needed conversation within our communities on how best to support young families in our common goal for an inclusive and healthy society.</p><p><font size=""5""><span style=""line-height: 30px;""><b>What's Next?</b></span></font></p><p></p>
<p>So now that I've got all these interviews and images what am I going to do with them? Well, there are three important ways that I want Young a Motherhood to be delivered:</p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>A film containing the interviews<br/>
</li>
<li>A book of the photographs and interview transcripts<br/>
</li>
<li>An exhibition of the portraits to launch the project and screen the film to the public in September or October 2014<br/>
</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>The film and the book would be valuable resources for young mothers and those working with them. Many of the women I spoke to related how important it is to have community and the encouragement of others who really understood their situation, and for those young women who may be feeling isolated these resources are valuable.</p><p>The exhibition is an opportunity to get press interested in the project and I am planning to invite down MPs, policy makers, journalists and organisations to honestly engage in the discussion. The exhibition would also be an opportunity to host panels, events and activities for families to come down and engage in the exhibition, opening up the gallery space to the wider community.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/649942/files/20140615004949-YMSusanPrev-6615.jpg?1402818589"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p> <p></p> <p> </p><h3><span style=""background-color: initial;"">How Much Is Needed?</span></h3>
<p><b>Gallery hire for a week-long exhibition: £1,300<br/></b></p>
<p><b>Producing exhibition prints and materials for hanging: £550</b></p>
<p><b>Promotional material for the exhibition (flyers, posters, invites): £150</b></p>
<p>As you can see the amount raised does not include the initial print run for the books as this is really expensive and would push up the total significantly! I am still researching my options for this (if you have any suggestions please get in touch!) but my initial plan is to take preorders in order to get the first set of books printed and take it from there.</p> <p></p> <p> </p><h3><span style=""background-color: initial;"">What Do You Get?</span></h3>
<p>For all your generous donations there are some perks provided ranging from love letters to invites to the exhibition private view and launch, to digital copies of the film and book and professional portrait shoot options (UK only). I'm working on providing more perks as well so I'll let you know when new ones become available! (Delivery dates for the digital love and love note perks are weekly, while rest will be delivered in Autumn, around the time of the exhibition launch. The portrait sessions will be arranged at a mutually convenient time for the both of us around Autumn/Winter 2014.)</p> <p></p> <p> </p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p></p>
<p>You can help me out by publicising the project and also this campaign with your family, friends, colleagues and any relevant organisations! If you are UK-based as well, please contact your local MP and let them know about this project and that you care about the misrepresentation of young mothers in the mainstream media. <a href=""http://www.jendella.co.uk/ym-project/2014/06/mobilise-your-mp/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Click here to see how you can contact them, as well as a template email you can sign and send.</a></p><p>Finally, if you have any questions please get in touch by email (jeni@jendella.co.uk) or Twitter (<a href=""http://www.twitter.com/YMotherhood_UK"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.twitter.com/YMotherhood_UK"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">@YMotherhood_UK</a> or<a href=""http://www.twitter.com/JENDELLA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">@JENDELLA</a>), and use the buttons below to share away!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/649946/files/20140615005101-YMJenniferPrev-5492.jpg?1402818661"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p></div>","I'm Jendella, a twenty-four year old photographer and filmmaker based in London.

I was inspired to start this project as I have friends who have had children at what society often deems to be ""too young"". I have witnessed their efforts in raising their children as well as working towards their own personal goals and have been inspired by their diligence and focus, as well as their persistence in overcoming challenges they face. However, in the mainstream consciousness this picture of the hard-working young mother is absent, and often the conversation about ""teen pregnancy"" or young motherhood revolves around ""irresponsible"" young girls, who are seen as promiscuous or opportunistic – opening their legs for council flats and handouts from the government. You will find ""irresponsible"" mothers at any age, but the tiny percentage of younger mothers who may not be making good decisions for them or their children has been used time and again to shame and belittle entire generations of young women playing one of the most important roles in our society. Not only is this ridiculous stereotype unfair, but the widespread public perception affects the real lives of young women who are working tirelessly to raise their children well, as well as continue in their education, career or other goals. This sensationalist perspective sells papers but it also misinforms policy makers and MPs, with young mothers being blamed for everything from the welfare deficit and housing shortage to urban crime and all other societal ills.   
Unlike common documentary photographic practices I do not wish to co-opt the stories of the ""marginalised"" or ""disadvantaged"". The most important part of this project was travelling around the UK to photograph and interview women (27 in total) who are, or have been, young mothers – that is women who have given birth to children in their early twenties or below – to hear directly from them what their experiences have been raising their children. I see myself as using my skills to amplify their voices in the hopes that their experiences can intelligently inform discussion and start a much-needed conversation within our communities on how best to support young families in our common goal for an inclusive and healthy society.What's Next?
So now that I've got all these interviews and images what am I going to do with them? Well, there are three important ways that I want Young a Motherhood to be delivered:

A film containing the interviews

A book of the photographs and interview transcripts

An exhibition of the portraits to launch the project and screen the film to the public in September or October 2014


The film and the book would be valuable resources for young mothers and those working with them. Many of the women I spoke to related how important it is to have community and the encouragement of others who really understood their situation, and for those young women who may be feeling isolated these resources are valuable.The exhibition is an opportunity to get press interested in the project and I am planning to invite down MPs, policy makers, journalists and organisations to honestly engage in the discussion. The exhibition would also be an opportunity to host panels, events and activities for families to come down and engage in the exhibition, opening up the gallery space to the wider community.   How Much Is Needed?
Gallery hire for a week-long exhibition: £1,300
Producing exhibition prints and materials for hanging: £550
Promotional material for the exhibition (flyers, posters, invites): £150
As you can see the amount raised does not include the initial print run for the books as this is really expensive and would push up the total significantly! I am still researching my options for this (if you have any suggestions please get in touch!) but my initial plan is to take preorders in order to get the first set of books printed and take it from there.   What Do You Get?
For all your generous donations there are some perks provided ranging from love letters to invites to the exhibition private view and launch, to digital copies of the film and book and professional portrait shoot options (UK only). I'm working on providing more perks as well so I'll let you know when new ones become available! (Delivery dates for the digital love and love note perks are weekly, while rest will be delivered in Autumn, around the time of the exhibition launch. The portrait sessions will be arranged at a mutually convenient time for the both of us around Autumn/Winter 2014.)   Other Ways You Can Help 
You can help me out by publicising the project and also this campaign with your family, friends, colleagues and any relevant organisations! If you are UK-based as well, please contact your local MP and let them know about this project and that you care about the misrepresentation of young mothers in the mainstream media. Click here to see how you can contact them, as well as a template email you can sign and send.Finally, if you have any questions please get in touch by email (jeni@jendella.co.uk) or Twitter (@YMotherhood_UK or@JENDELLA), and use the buttons below to share away!",3.0,2,"1 Campaign

</p><p><b>THIS IS WHAT WE'RE UP TO</b></p>
<p>In May of 2015, Taylor Yocom and KT
Hawbaker-Krohn will bring together their two photography series under the
fabulous roof of Public Space One. This gallery will exhibit Yocom and
Hawbaker-Krohn's combined efforts under the name ""Looker,"" a
reappropriation of harmful, anti-woman slang that gives the gaze and
perspective back to feminists. </p>
<p>Yocom's
project, ""Guarded,"" unites gendered vulnerabilities, defenses, and
notions of self-advocacy by featuring a community of women posing with their
keys, mace, and other forms of ""keychain self-defense."" Inspired by
her conversations with other women students at the University of Iowa, Yocom
hopes that this photo series unveils the common realities that women face as
they walk home from class and work. This series explores the diverse levels of
violence and safety that feminine identities face within the Iowa City community.  Guarded has gained local and national press, and you can read more about the project at these links on <a href=""http://www.bustle.com/articles/50819-art-student-taylor-yocoms-guarded-photo-series-shows-how-college-women-protect-themselves-from-assault"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bustle</a> and <a href=""http://littlevillagemag.com/photo-project-highlights-what-women-carry-in-self-defense/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Little Village</a>.</p>
<p>Hawbaker-Krohn's
project, ""Nudes Leaked,"" addresses issues of nudity and power. By
teaming up with photographer Laurie Haag, Hawbaker-Krohn sought to give the
women in her community an opportunity to demonstrate what nakedness meant to
them as individuals and to flesh out (sometimes literally) the distinction
between birthday- and power-suits. By inviting subjects to choose locations and
poses that met at the intersections of their own strength and vulnerability,
""Nudes Leaked"" seeks to interrupt the cultural narrative that equates
female nudity with weakness, mainstream pornography, and fear. </p>
<p><b>WANNA
HELP? </b></p>
<p>In order to
print and frame the portraits displayed at this upcoming exhibit, Yocom and
Hawbaker-Krohn would like raise $1500 to cover these costs. The organizers will
also be creating media such as buttons and posters to advertise this exhibition
and to share at the community forum taking place at the opening night soiree at
PS1. </p>
<p><b>WHAT EXACTLY WILL THIS DO FOR THE

<p>The act of
coming together and sharing our realities is an inherently feminist act. Both
of these projects provide women from rich walks of life to tell their stories
and to directly address the restrictions, inhibitions, and limits culture
creates. By supporting this project, you are making a choice to support
feminist artwork and alternative storytelling. </p>
<p>On anther note,

This is my second round of fundraising for this project. I am happy to say that I was able to fund my initial work on Echoes last year using Kickstarter and I hope to have the same success this time around with Indiegogo.This project of three years is deeply important to me because it explores my spirituality and beliefs. It is my hope this project, which explores the human capacity for multiple etherial and spiritual lives, will inspire and enhance the lives of others.

virgins, air-born and land-born: Welcome to Black Rock City Municipal
Airport. You already know about Burning Man, but you may not know
that the City boasts an active airport for it's 70,000 residents and
is the second busiest airport in the state of Nevada during the festival.
First opened in 1999 and designated by the FAA as 88NV, it is inside
the Reno MOA on aeronautical charts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Assisting
88NV since its inception has been The Black Rock Travel Agency
(<a href=""http://www.blackrocktravelagency.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">BRTA</a>), the airport theme camp of record--BRTA has been the fixed base
operation (FBO) of choice for the BRC Municipal Airport since the beginning. We are passionate about large art in public spaces, and
assisting our world-class airport in any way we can.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/403023/files/20140301105601-_08_BRTA_letters.jpg?1393700161"" src="""" style=""width: 369.937px; height: 278px;""/></p><p></p>
<p>
</p><p>When
you think airport, you probably envision a terminal of
some sort to host pilots, passengers and airport staff – at the very least,
a structure as a gathering area for the operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Over
the years, these airport structures were utilitarian, functional, and
whimsical, but then the bar was raised. In 2006 one of our pilots, Twilight + crew, created what was to become the central focus
of the airport. The ""Terminal"" as it was known, was bigger
and bluer than anything we had seen. It was also heavy and difficult to
assemble and store--its life eventually gave out and the materials were re-purposed after three great years. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/403040/files/20140301110200-IMG_0414.JPG?1393700520"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p>
</p><p>After the 2008 event it was clear we would need a bigger space that was easier to construct.  It was then that Michael Twing,
Steve Ramseur and others created an efficient,
resourceful, economic and larger structure that would get us
through the next four years. Ultimately, this structure carried us through to 2013 when we launched a design competition for the next incarnation of airport space.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/403036/files/20140301110113-_10_shade-evening.jpg?1393700473"" src="""" style=""width: 565.333px; height: 424px;""/></p><p></p><b>The design of <i>Starport</i>...</b><p><b><br/></b></p><p>Designed

<p></p></div>","First a little history...Burners,
virgins, air-born and land-born: Welcome to Black Rock City Municipal
Airport. You already know about Burning Man, but you may not know
that the City boasts an active airport for it's 70,000 residents and
is the second busiest airport in the state of Nevada during the festival.
First opened in 1999 and designated by the FAA as 88NV, it is inside
the Reno MOA on aeronautical charts.

Assisting
88NV since its inception has been The Black Rock Travel Agency
(BRTA), the airport theme camp of record--BRTA has been the fixed base
operation (FBO) of choice for the BRC Municipal Airport since the beginning. We are passionate about large art in public spaces, and
assisting our world-class airport in any way we can.

When
you think airport, you probably envision a terminal of
some sort to host pilots, passengers and airport staff – at the very least,
a structure as a gathering area for the operation.

Over
the years, these airport structures were utilitarian, functional, and
whimsical, but then the bar was raised. In 2006 one of our pilots, Twilight + crew, created what was to become the central focus
of the airport. The ""Terminal"" as it was known, was bigger
and bluer than anything we had seen. It was also heavy and difficult to
assemble and store--its life eventually gave out and the materials were re-purposed after three great years. 

After the 2008 event it was clear we would need a bigger space that was easier to construct.  It was then that Michael Twing,
Steve Ramseur and others created an efficient,
resourceful, economic and larger structure that would get us
through the next four years. Ultimately, this structure carried us through to 2013 when we launched a design competition for the next incarnation of airport space.The design of Starport...Designed
by architect Ross Smith, Starport won the worldwide design competition initiated by Luke Lukoskie (more on the competition here) for our new pavilion last year.
Starport
will
be in a new class of architecture, one that is consistent with Burning Man being one of the largest outdoor art festivals in the world.

Starport
is
not your typical airport pavilion. It is a place where large-scale
visual art is performed, community flourishes, and the desert pulses
beneath an iconic structure with soaring shade wings and trusses.A key feature of Starport is the Observation Deck, which will offer panoramic views of the city and runway. Starport is designed around a simple truss pyramid, which is economical, sturdy, easy to assemble, disassemble and store, and will last many years. Think of Starport as consisting of two main structural elements: one is the central truss (described above) and the other is a set of cables that tie the trusses to the ground and offer attachment points for the large shade sails. Starport is perfectly suited for Burning Man. It is easy to store, durable, functional, and fun. Most importantly, it will be an event space for all that Burning Man has to offer. Please join us in this endeavor and make Starport your next destination. Your donation will directly contribute
to creating Starport: fully functional, long-lasting, elegant, and gorgeous. It is a timeless
structure in the middle of nowhere, telling our artistic community
at Burning Man, ""You Are Home"".

We
have received incredible support from our extended airport community
over the years but it’s time to take things to the next level…

To
realize Starport's
future, will require a total of $40,000 in our fundraising push: $10,000 has been slated from a variety of sources, so now we turn to Indiegogo for the remaining $30,000. To really kick things off we now turn to you, our loyal airport community, to keep the momentum flowing.Here's a closer look at how the money raised from this Indiegogo campaign will be spent.In
return for your individual donation, a bounty of acknowledgements and
decorations will be yours, in addition to the ongoing rewarding
benefits of being a member of the Burning Man BRC Municipal Airport
Community.


Just as
we did with the terminal in 2009, the many BRTA volunteers who are
dedicated to the Black Rock City Municipal Airport’s success will construct
Starport.

We
are committed to being transparent and thorough in reporting
our expenses during this process.

Black Rock Travel Agency is excited to contribute an art installation, breaking new ground for
large public structures at Burning Man.
Starport
will host a variety of events that will be sure to attract interest
from the community and create a new and a significant destination and
meeting place for all.If you didn't catch it earlier, we'd like to offer you a perk for your contribution. Check them out on the upper right of this page.  Any amount you can donate is appreciated! ____________________________________________________________________About UsMichael
Twing, also humbly known as Rebar King, has been a fixture at the
airport since its inception in 1999. He has been instrumental in
the organization and growth of 88NV, instigating many a riot with the
other managers. Growing up in San Francisco with the likes of Jerry
James (designed and built the first Man) and the Cacophony Society,
he is no amateur to a beach burn. Rebar has been in the official
position as the airports Logistics Manager, aka Land Commander, from 2006 to 2012. Now back at the reins of the Black Rock Travel Agency, Rebar
knows how to get 'er done. Rebar is a general contractor by trade
with a giving heart. When not out on the big dusty he's living large
in Mill Valley, CA, with Suzanne, three kids and a doggy. Michael
P. Anderson, aka Agent Nation, co-founded The Black
Rock Travel Agency with Dream11 and Meshugganah in 1995, and has participated at Burning Man every year since 1991. It was an easy decision in 1999 to have
the agency partner with the new airport:--Nation and a dedicated crew of
travel agents have been active at 88NV ever since, where many agents have held
management positions over the years. One of Nation's significant contributions
includes BeRTA, one of the first Art Cars brought to the event, beginning in 1996. 
Nation and the BRTA have also supported the airports' annual pancake
breakfast and Saturday cocktail party since their inception. Nation
is active in his small town, Nevada City, CA, supporting many
businesses with his professional IT services company. When not busy with his
many sons (we've lost count) coaching Little League, volunteering with local schools, and river monitoring with SYRCL, he can
be found soaking in the many hot springs of his favorite getaway - Soldier Meadows and the Black Rock Desert. Ross
Smith is an architect, art enthusiast, and the designer of Starport Pavilion.
After winning the BRTA/EcoLogic Design Labs sponsored design competition he soon realized it
was up to him to see his vision manifest. He's been practicing
architecture for two decades and believes the design process is all
encompassing, from the initial concept to the tiniest bolt. New to the
airport but no stranger to getting his hands dirty, he is excited to join the BRTA family in building Starport. He spent much of his childhood living in Guatemala and flying a Cessna with his dad. He now lives in Berkeley where he teaches and practices architecture. Steve Ramseur, known on the playa as Fabar, brought a humble yet 
effective shade structure and a modest but functional interactive art 
piece to the airport in 2002. The first little porch swing didn't appear
 until the next year, but over time, the shades and swings became the 
art projects. The Mood Swing made its debut at the airport in 2006, and 
after several remodels was accepted for display on the playa in 2010. 
The Pea Pod airport camp shade debuted in '09, and like Fabar, continues to 
serve the airport logistics crew. Back at reality camp in Eugene, 
Oregon, he has worked as an educator in construction and currently 
manages property. He is active in neighborhood and community politics, produces a mean homemade ginger ale, and once flew a hang glider 43 miles.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Over the summer, Brian and I are traveling across the United
States to offer free workshops to help Native American youth find a creative
voice. Focusing on teenagers, we are offering them expressive tools at a
critical time in their development as well as showing them some of the many options
that are available in the creative arts. It is widely recognized that the
practice of art-making empowers, and our goal is to provide an introduction to
the arts for the kids that we meet along the way.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our
 mission is to implement a systematic program for fostering 
individuality and self-expression in Native American teenagers, in order
 to empower them to break out of the perception that their options are 
limited.  And, to create a network for these kids so they can continue to explore the arts and make friends with other Native American teenagers around the country.<span style=""font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;""><br/></span></p>

<p>Every young person makes mistakes, and every young person deserves a second chance.</p>
<p>Our program is an arts-based alternative to incarceration for teens being sentenced as adults. So far, more than 500 of us have avoided adult sentencing, and most of us have avoided a life-long adult criminal record at as young as 16 years old. Thanks to Young New Yorkers our adult criminal cases are dismissed and sealed.<br/> <br/><strong>2. ART ADVOCACY</strong><br/><strong>We use art to advocate for ourselves.</strong> We take our artworks to court to show who we are beyond our rap sheets. To show the judges and prosecutors that we are awesome, creative and resilient young people who are working towards a bright future. This humanizes the way they see us, and humanizes the culture of the courtrooms, leading to better sentencing options for future teens.<br/> <br/><strong>We use art to advocate for criminal justice reform.</strong> At the end of each program we host a public art project that addresses a criminal justice issue that is important to us. We invite the very criminal justice professionals involved in our sentencing to attend our public art projects. So far we have used art to address mass incarceration, gun violence, solitary confinement, being prosecuted as an adult at 16, and local policing. We use art to re-center ourselves in the conversations on the issues that impact us the most.<br/> <br/><strong>Thank you for your partnership!</strong></p>

<h3>M.L.I.B.T.Y. project:</h3>
I started M.L.I.B.T.Y. project (My life is better than yours/ Don't worry, you don't live your life anyway), in 2009, as a small part of my global paper toy project. <br/>My paper toys are usually free for download on my websites (Be sure to check them out, there are more than 200 toys, both customs and my design!). I come from traditional arts, but in 2007 I fell in love with paper toy art at a first sight. Since then, I'm active supporter to the paper toy community and have realized many paper toy projects, collaborations, solo and group exhibitions, artist in residency program, lectures, workshops and even stop motion videos. I'm also publishing the only paper toy mag on internet, II LOVE (<a href=""http://www.yebomaycu.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.yebomaycu.com</a>), which is also free for download. More details on my websites and in my curriculum. <br/><br/>This year I started working on totally new paper toy character and some of the works are already available on my website for free download. I began with ""Streetz Riot"" series, under mentioned M.L.I.B.T.Y. project and this series will consist of more than twenty paper toys. Some of them will be free for download, some of them are downloadable under small fee and some are already available on my page. <br/><h3>Campaign:</h3>
My next step would be to make a big installation with the whole series. I have plans for other big series as well, but this depends on the success of this initiative. The idea is to make a big glass cube and construct the paper toy scene inside. As for now, it would be the biggest paper toy scene from one artist, considered as one unique work of art (and not different paper toys put together). The glass box will be 100x100x70cm and inside I'll make a scenography for some 20-30 toys. To have a better idea and a picture of my idea, check out the photos I took on the streets of Rovinj, a small city in Croatia, where I currently work on mentioned project, (amongst few others). <br/><br/>With this campaign I'm trying to raise some money for the material and production of the whole installation, which I'll expose on my future exhibitions. <br/>Even if I don't reach my goal, I'll use this money to realize my idea. If there's any extra money, I'll channel it to the next paper toy scene installation, which will be also under the glass box with same dimensions and you can be sure to see a new campaign for it!</div>

<div>Note that if you buy one of my toys from my website, you'll also supporting the same project!</div>
<div>
<br/>What's interesting here is that even if you just can't contribute, I have something for you and it's for free!! Just visit one of my websites and download any toy you like! Here are some tips to make it look like on my pics: use photo mate paper, 180 g and higher, precise cutter, inkjet printer, original cartridges (many inks fade under light with time), and set your printer settings to high quality printing. <br/><br/>Moreover, if you're creative and like collaborations, you can join one of my projects called ""ye-boT initiative"", customize one of my paper toys, @ <a href=""http://www.yebomaycu.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.yebomaycu.com</a>, and take part in my future ""ye-boT initiative"" shows! <br/><br/>There's much more to say about my projects and achievements, but it would occupy too much space here, so if you want to know more, study my webpage or drop me a mail! <br/><br/> Marko Zubak <br/><br/><a href=""http://www.markozubak.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.markozubak.com</a> <br/><a href=""http://www.yebomaycu.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.yebomaycu.com</a><br/><a href=""http://www.nextfloors.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.nextfloors.com</a>

<h3>Visioneer David Danforth</h3>
I've been traveling across the country for 6 years.  Primarily, I've hitchiked all across this land.  In that time I've had no regular or reliable source of income, but I've learned a lot about how to live without money.  I've worked with Fat Kids Kitchen, a travelling free-food kitchen, since 2007.   I practice an economic style called Co-Operative Living.  Any time I want something, some sort of exchange is required to achieve my desired results.  Sometimes, that can be offering an opportunity for someone to give in a way they can feel good about.  Or an opportunity for someone to not give in a way they can feel about it.  We all do what we can, to live our lives and take care of our families.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I am creating a non-profit music and arts festival, Sweatervest Sweaterfest, for the benefit of a mobile free food kitchen.  The idea is if we can pay for most of the event up-front, any donations at the gate could go straight to the free food kitchen bus.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The idea is that there are people who like what we are doing, but can't come out to show their support.  So I wanted to create an easy way for people to contribute to the cause.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I've estimated that it will cost around $500 to provide porta-potties for our benefit.  Any amount closer to that goal is one less dollar I have to find somewhere else.  I know that our community would greatly appreciate having well maintained facilities at the first annual Interdisciplinary Arts Club meeting: Sweatervest Sweaterfest. </div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>You should also know that the Interdisciplinary Arts Club has an EIN# and can write tax deductible reciepts by request.</strong></div>
<p> </p>
<h3>Co-operative Living</h3>
<p>We need $500 for porta-johns.  That means if 5 people contribute 100 dollars, or if 500 people contribute a dollar, we'll have reached our goal.</p>
<p>Anyone who contributes $100 will recieve a shoulder or carrying bag.  Hand stitched by me, out of durable material, designed to take some wear and tear.  These type take around 7-12 hours to complete, and have custom features and patches.  They also come with a 1 year repair plan.  As long as you don't shred it to pieces or burn it completely to ash, I'll fix it.</p>
<ul>
<li>$50 dollar donations will recieve 3 very nice custom patches, hand made by me.</li>
<li>If you send us $15 or more, I'll make you some kind of sweet patch, and mail it to you. </li>
<li>Even if you can't contribute, I usually have a needle and floss on me, and I would do a quick on the spot repair for anyone.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>Anything Helps :-)</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
This project is the begining of so many beautiful friendships, and connections already.  Plans are already in motion for collaborative efforts next year.  The idea for the event is to get together as many different groups and types of people together.  Bringing them together, under something I think we all can agree upon.  Art is Good.  We don't all agree about what constitutes good art, but that's ok too.  The glbt community, the rainbow family, the grateful dead family, ravers, burners, christians, activists, mothers, and fathers all share something else in common.  We all value the freedom to live by what we belive in.  This is a celebration of diversity, and the many things that we the human family share in common.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In my travels I have descovered what it means to me to be a leader.  A leader is someone who does the most work, and therefore people expect them to know things and to tell them what to do.  I've worked with a free food kitchen for 5 years.  We go to gatherings all over the country, feeding and helping eachother, and everyone else.  I've built, by myself, a kitchen that fed a gathering ranging from 20 to 100 people over two weeks.  One or two volunteers usually find me when I'm preparing a big meal.  Or sometimes I'll ask, in general, if anyone wants to help me.  I've been to hundreds of festivals, dozens of Rainbow Gatherings in the national forest, and I've walked through just about every cool town in this country.  Through all of these experiences, I've been thinking for a while of how I might run an event, and appreciate when events include the ""audience"" as co-creators.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>When you live on the road, and you want to have friends when you go back places, you have to do right by them.  I see people I know, everywhere I go, and if I want to have a pleasant existence it behooves me to be good to people.  I work hard, I dance hard, I sing crazy, and I help everyone I can, in whatever way I can.  In turn, I usually taken care of.  But I'll help you whether I like you or not, whether you take care of me or not, everyone gets fed, everyone gets water, and everyone gets a cigarette that asks, if I've got them.</div>
<div> </div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<div class=""one_third"">
<p>Walking a dog in the cold fall and winter weather in Montreal, Canada is the perfect testing ground for touchscreen gloves.  I bought my first pair of touchscreen gloves last Fall (2011). The first pair I ordered looked really cool, but they weren’t cheap. I paid a little more than $60, but figured they were a new, tech-gadget-type of product and figured that’s what they probably cost.</p>
</div>
<div class=""one_third last"">
<p>Aside from the sizing issue (I returned the first pair because they were too small), the gloves seemed pretty cool. I put them on and was able to answer a call. Well actually, I realized I couldn’t do much more than that after playing around for a few minutes. The gloves had these silver patches on the index finger and the thumb of both hands. The problem with the design, was that these patches didn’t conform to the tips of the fingers. When you think about it, that’s pretty much the same as any gloves. You don’t need them to fit snugly and tightly on your finger tips normally because you would take them off to perform any delicate tasks. I went back to the trusty Internet and ordered a few more pairs. This time I decided to buy gloves that were knit and made of acrylic. The acrylic gloves fit very well because of the spandex, but as the temperature went below 5C (40F), the gloves weren't keeping my hands warm. They did work really well and allowed me to text, type and do whatever I wanted, but the quality wasn’t always very high. Overall they were good but I definitely needed something that was warmer and of better quality. So I decided to try creating some touchscreen gloves with my friend Scott. Through my experience using the gloves and Scott's design skills, we were able to create Concepts Gloves™.</p>
</div>
<p>We see touchscreen gloves as a bridge between the static charge on your hands and your touchscreen device, not as regular gloves with special capabilities. Yes they are gloves and gloves should keep your hands warm, but the first priority and duty of touchscreen gloves is to enable you to text, touch and type with precision and accuracy. Gloves that fail in this regard fall between gloves and touchscreen gloves. In other words, they are pretty basic gloves with some small degree of touchscreen capability. So the deal is, if you live in a cold climate and you’d like to or you absolutely need to be able to keep your gloves on (like who wouldn’t) to use your touchscreen device, then remember this:</p>
<p>1. If touchscreen gloves don’t conform tightly and snugly to the tips of your fingers, they won’t work properly.<br/> 2. The thicker the glove, the worse they will work.<br/> 3. Silver patches on your finger tips make as much sense as a car with square wheels<br/> 4. One size fits all never fits all when it comes to touchscreen gloves.</p>
<p>We decided to make gloves for different seasons and different climates because there really couldn’t be one material suitable for all seasons and all climates.</p>
<p><br/><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong><br/>We are looking to raise more capital in order to be able to market and build our brand and our business. Your funding will directly impact how far and wide we can reach and will also help us start on next year's designs and production as well as fund additional product development.</p>
<p><br/>Fund this project and you'll get a pair of gloves within 10 days (or less). The gloves are perfect for any smartphone user or as a holiday gift. Depending on how much you contribute you can choose from 2 models in 2-3 different styles (depending on the model) which come in 2 sizes. We will provide you with a product catalogue upon receiving your funding. We will also contact you with a personal thank you note and/or call if you leave us your contact info.</p>
<p><br/>Since this project is already rolling, any funds we get will help us keep things going forward. No matter what you contribute, you will have a direct impact on our success.</p>
<p><br/><strong>The Impact</strong><br/>Here's how we see the world: There are big corporations that do what they will with no regard for the environment, for the consumer or for anything other than profit. Small businesses like ours are the exact opposite. We care about the environment (we ship in 100% recycled and biodegradable envelopes), consumer (product was created with care and passion by touchscreen a device user) and tend to do business with small businesses (little boutiques, small online stores etc). At the end of the day this product solves a real world problem (not an important one, but one nonetheless) which is people avoiding having to take off their gloves in winter in order to be able to use their touchscreen. It's useful, well designed and created with care and passion by a one person company. <br/><br/>O<strong>ther Ways You Can Help</strong><br/>If you can't contribute money to this project, you can still help us by getting the word out about our product. <br/>You can use the indiegogo share tools or you can get people to follow us on Twitter or Facebook. Every little thing you can do will ultimately help this business succeed and grow. <br/><br/>Thank you so much for your help and your belief. We care so much and promise we will succeed with your help! <br/><br/>Much Love,</p>

Yes they are gloves and gloves should keep your hands warm, but the first priority and duty of touchscreen gloves is to enable you to text, touch and type with precision and accuracy. Gloves that fail in this regard fall between gloves and touchscreen gloves. In other words, they are pretty basic gloves with some small degree of touchscreen capability. So the deal is, if you live in a cold climate and you’d like to or you absolutely need to be able to keep your gloves on (like who wouldn’t) to use your touchscreen device, then remember this:
1. If touchscreen gloves don’t conform tightly and snugly to the tips of your fingers, they won’t work properly. 2. The thicker the glove, the worse they will work. 3. Silver patches on your finger tips make as much sense as a car with square wheels 4. One size fits all never fits all when it comes to touchscreen gloves.
We decided to make gloves for different seasons and different climates because there really couldn’t be one material suitable for all seasons and all climates.
What We Need & What You GetWe are looking to raise more capital in order to be able to market and build our brand and our business. Your funding will directly impact how far and wide we can reach and will also help us start on next year's designs and production as well as fund additional product development.
Fund this project and you'll get a pair of gloves within 10 days (or less). The gloves are perfect for any smartphone user or as a holiday gift. Depending on how much you contribute you can choose from 2 models in 2-3 different styles (depending on the model) which come in 2 sizes. We will provide you with a product catalogue upon receiving your funding. We will also contact you with a personal thank you note and/or call if you leave us your contact info.
Since this project is already rolling, any funds we get will help us keep things going forward. No matter what you contribute, you will have a direct impact on our success.
The ImpactHere's how we see the world: There are big corporations that do what they will with no regard for the environment, for the consumer or for anything other than profit. Small businesses like ours are the exact opposite. We care about the environment (we ship in 100% recycled and biodegradable envelopes), consumer (product was created with care and passion by touchscreen a device user) and tend to do business with small businesses (little boutiques, small online stores etc). At the end of the day this product solves a real world problem (not an important one, but one nonetheless) which is people avoiding having to take off their gloves in winter in order to be able to use their touchscreen. It's useful, well designed and created with care and passion by a one person company. Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can't contribute money to this project, you can still help us by getting the word out about our product. You can use the indiegogo share tools or you can get people to follow us on Twitter or Facebook. Every little thing you can do will ultimately help this business succeed and grow. Thank you so much for your help and your belief. We care so much and promise we will succeed with your help! Much Love,

<h3><b>Who</b></h3>
<p>I've been taking photos ever since I was a kid, after winning a Polaroid camera in a painting competition. In the intervening years, a camera has always with me during important periods of my life, capturing whatever I was passionate about at the time: as a surfer it was surfing, and music; in art school it was arty stuff; as a spiritual seeker it was travels throughout India. Now, after years of working as a graphic designer, author and film journalist, I have realised what I enjoyed the most was taking photos. Living in London, it was live music that reawakened my love of looking at life through a lens, propelled by one of those twists of fate that comes from saying ""I can do that"" at the right time (which was also how I became an internationally published author), and I ended up shooting some gigs for a friend's website. From that moment I was hooked. </p>

<p>There are many styles and genres of photography, but shooting live gigs presents many of its own challenges. The lighting and on-stage action is constantly changing, often extreme, and always unpredictable. OK, it's not exactly a combat zone, but there is no shortage of noise, projectiles and fervent behaviour, especially when you are caught in the mosh pit (more than once I've come out bruised). When it comes to capturing the emotion of music, a picture is definitely worth more than a thousand words.</p>

<p>Over the past couple of years I have been out at least twice a week, shooting hundreds of up-and-coming bands in small, mostly badly lit pubs and clubs, as well as more established acts in bigger, well-lit venues. Many of these acts have risen from local obscurity to national recognition, and others have inevitably fallen back into obscurity. </p>

<h3>What</h3>
<p>Following in the tradition of some of the great music photographers that came before, I managed to secure a position as a house photographer for a well-known London promoter. It is unpaid, but has allowed me access to some great gigs that I would have otherwise not had the opportunity to shoot. Unlike the halcyon days of the UK music press, opportunities, and the economics, for making any money from shooting gigs have become almost non existent. However, galleries, such as Proud, Getty and Rock Archive, have regular exhibitions of music photography. Of course, these are shots of music icons by renowned photographers and, for the most part, come with price tags to match the subject's and/or photographer's status. From my point of view, the main job of a music photographer is to take iconic pictures, and not just pictures of icons, and it should be remembered that many of those iconic photos in the galleries were taken before the artists became icons, which is what gives them their current value.</p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-style: normal;"">With that in mind, I approached the promoter with the idea of holding an exhibition, in one of their venues, of some of my best shots taken in their venues around London (look in the gallery section of this campaign for some examples, more will be added over the campaign). To my (pleasant) surprise, they agreed, which left me with the dilemma of not only choosing a selection of pictures to display but also getting them printed and framed. Narrowing the selection down to 30 images from the thousands I've taken is not going to be easy, but finding the money for the printing and framing is going to be harder, and this, dear friends, is where you come in.</span></p>

Andy Warhol was (is) an icon of pop culture, art and innovation. Rob Pruitt, a contemporary artist inspired by Warhol, created <em>The Andy Monument</em> as a tribute to the late artist. The sculpture is based on a combination of digital scanning of a live model and hand sculpting. Its surface is finished in chrome and the seven-foot-tall figure stands a top a concrete pedestal. It depicts Warhol as a ghostly, silver presence: a potent cultural force as both artist and self-created myth. </p>

<div>CAMH is a leading destination located in Houston, TX for contemporary art. Bringing <em>The Andy Monument </em>to the front lawn of the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston in the heart of the Museum District will bring a part of Andy’s legacy to Houstonians and visitors of all ages and backgrounds. As the sculpture became a landmark to the people of New York City, we hope the same will be true for Houstonians and its visitors. The impact Andy Warhol had on history is hard to measure but no doubt is relevant to our current culture. Andy’s presence will engage his visitors and open dialogue about his work and contemporary art. CAMH reaches audiences of over 150,000 each year and recently started a new initiative to use its lawn space as an outdoor exhibition area for sculptures, attracting and engaging visitors to the Museum and surrounding Museum District. 
<p><strong>Who was Andy Warhol? </strong></p>
<p><em>Andy</em> <em>Warhol</em> (1928-1987) was an American artist and is considered the quintessential Pop Artist celebrating fame, wealth and glamour and in so doing changed the course of both popular culture and art history - inspiring most artists who have risen to fame in the past 30 years in significant ways. In his larger-than-life persona, Warhol remains one of New York's enduring icons. Today his iconic images of the Campbell Soup Can, Elvis or Marilyn are so ubiquitous they appear safe, but it's not hard to remember how strange and downright dangerous these were when they were first hung in museums.</p>

<p>Is a world filled with more positivity. I make it a duty of myself to spread laughter and joy to all those around me on a daily basis. Right now I'm reaching those that I interact with on the day to day, but my true passion is to reach people I've never met. I want someone having a bad day to find something I've created and to help them have a better day. To know that there is someone out there that loves them or at the very least can make them laugh.</p>

<p>I know that not everyone that sees this is going to be enrolled in my vision. Or perhaps you're enrolled in so many visions that you can't help out financially right now. I get that.

Also, the eerie and extraordinary red sunrises and looming flaming moons at night? As we now know, those photogenic phenomena were a direct result of one of the worst wildfires in California's history. It began at nearby Jawbone Ridge in the Stanislaus National Forest and spread to Yosemite National Park. Now called the 2013 <b>Rim Fire</b>, it burned 254,685 acres, or 400 square miles, of our protected woodlands. The Temple 2013 for Trees has reached our original goal of raising $5,000 in order to replenish more than <b>DOUBLE </b>the wood we used to construct the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/templeofwhollyness"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Temple of Whollyness</a> in partnership with <a href=""http://www.greenforestswork.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Green Forests Work</a>.

In that spirit, we are inaugurating a tree planting program to offset the wood we burn, so that these two opposite actions complete the circle of our Temple. We feel that we are being called to take this important step in the direction of walking-the-walk towards fully cherishing our planet. With the Temple 2013 burn, we will completely “Leave No Trace"" in a way that extends beyond the pristine playa we leave behind.<p></p>

<p>By looking into the flames without fear, we see that we need carbon and fire to live as they are building blocks of our planet. In a very real and tangible way, fire promotes vegetation growth and the subsequent uptake of CO2 in natural ecosystems. Perhaps there is a way that fire can help us break the code on solving some of our environmental issues? Our Temple can honor the importance of the release of fire, while completing the cycle by re-planting what was burned.</p>
<p><a href=""http://greenforestswork.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""A child helping plant tress in Appalachia"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/801/141/a48a1c5a40ae8e39d7b8598705ac752d_large.JPG?1375554040"" src="""" style=""""/></a><a href=""http://greenforestswork.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">A child helping plant tress in Appalachia</a>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<p>So we decided to ask tree experts for assistance with our plan and they calculated the number of replacement trees from converting the weight of the Temple birch, pine and fir into board feet. A board foot is a standard measure of the usable wood in a tree. You can picture a board foot as a piece of lumber one-inch thick, one foot wide, and one foot long (1"" x 12"" x 12""). The Temple uses about the same amount of wood as an average single family home. If we look at trees that are only 12"" in diameter, that would be 800 trees. With adjustments for mortality at 12%, we were advised to re-plant about 907 trees. We set our goal to plant 2 trees for every tree that we use to build the Temple -- to not only replace the trees that will serve us in our Temple offering, but to return even more trees to our planet -- so we are planting 2,000 trees in total.</p>

<p>We chose <a href=""http://greenforestswork.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Green Forests Work</strong></a> as an ideal organization to collaborate with. They are focused on regenerating forest lands in Appalachia that have been destroyed from hilltop removal for coal mining. Their mission is intriguing because of all the co-benefits their work creates: forest regeneration, biodiversity regeneration, water basin restoration, soil toxicity amelioration, social justice promotion, and climate change mitigation/adaptation, to name a few. The cost for Green Forests Work to replant these 2,000 trees is $4,500. We will net this amount, after Indiegogo fees, when we raise a total of $5,000.</p>

<p></p></span></span></span></div>","Update: Do you remember the ubiquitous haze during Burning Man 2013? Also, the eerie and extraordinary red sunrises and looming flaming moons at night? As we now know, those photogenic phenomena were a direct result of one of the worst wildfires in California's history. It began at nearby Jawbone Ridge in the Stanislaus National Forest and spread to Yosemite National Park. Now called the 2013 Rim Fire, it burned 254,685 acres, or 400 square miles, of our protected woodlands. The Temple 2013 for Trees has reached our original goal of raising $5,000 in order to replenish more than DOUBLE the wood we used to construct the Temple of Whollyness in partnership with Green Forests Work. Since the Rim Fire devastation, our new goal is to raise $10,000 by September 30th so that we may also donate funds to the National Forest Foundation to aid with the Rim Fire restoration efforts. Please consider a donation to benefit our neighboring Black Rock Desert forest lands.

(Photo credit: Michael Holden)The Temple of Whollyness’ purpose is to serve our community as the spiritual nexus -- to offer the space and opportunity for participants to express themselves in order to become whole. In that spirit, we are inaugurating a tree planting program to offset the wood we burn, so that these two opposite actions complete the circle of our Temple. We feel that we are being called to take this important step in the direction of walking-the-walk towards fully cherishing our planet. With the Temple 2013 burn, we will completely “Leave No Trace"" in a way that extends beyond the pristine playa we leave behind.

By looking into the flames without fear, we see that we need carbon and fire to live as they are building blocks of our planet. In a very real and tangible way, fire promotes vegetation growth and the subsequent uptake of CO2 in natural ecosystems. Perhaps there is a way that fire can help us break the code on solving some of our environmental issues? Our Temple can honor the importance of the release of fire, while completing the cycle by re-planting what was burned.

So we decided to ask tree experts for assistance with our plan and they calculated the number of replacement trees from converting the weight of the Temple birch, pine and fir into board feet. A board foot is a standard measure of the usable wood in a tree. You can picture a board foot as a piece of lumber one-inch thick, one foot wide, and one foot long (1"" x 12"" x 12""). The Temple uses about the same amount of wood as an average single family home. If we look at trees that are only 12"" in diameter, that would be 800 trees. With adjustments for mortality at 12%, we were advised to re-plant about 907 trees. We set our goal to plant 2 trees for every tree that we use to build the Temple -- to not only replace the trees that will serve us in our Temple offering, but to return even more trees to our planet -- so we are planting 2,000 trees in total.
Green Forests Work

 

We chose Green Forests Work as an ideal organization to collaborate with. They are focused on regenerating forest lands in Appalachia that have been destroyed from hilltop removal for coal mining. Their mission is intriguing because of all the co-benefits their work creates: forest regeneration, biodiversity regeneration, water basin restoration, soil toxicity amelioration, social justice promotion, and climate change mitigation/adaptation, to name a few. The cost for Green Forests Work to replant these 2,000 trees is $4,500. We will net this amount, after Indiegogo fees, when we raise a total of $5,000.
Since we are a gathering of environmentally and socially concerned citizens, we hope to easily raise the required funds and gift Green Forests Work the TOTAL amount we receive from this Indiegogo campaign. 
Thank you for your support. Wholly yours,Temple 2013 for Trees

<p>My name is Roselina Hung, and I have been selected to take part in the SIM Residency in Reykjavik, Iceland for the month of September. I will be one of twelve artists creating and presenting new works and taking part in the Icelandic art scene with local and international artists. During my residency, I will be working on a series of large-scale drawings, <em>Pretty Boys Kill Me</em>, in preparation for an exhibition at Gallery Fukai in spring 2013 in Vancouver, Canada. </p>
<h3>SIM Residency Reykjavik</h3>
<p>Run by the Association of Icelandic Visual Artists, the SIM Residency offers artists a living space and studio in Reykjavik. The building where I will be residing and working in <span>also houses studios for about forty Icelandic artists, as well as an art school, workshop and exhibition space. As a self-directed residency, SIM seeks to promote a creative environment where artists can reflect, study and work on their artistic process. All expenses related to the residency, including a program fee and travel expenses, are paid by the artists.</span></p>

<h3><strong>How will this residency benefit me?</strong></h3>
<p>Last year, I had amazing opportunities to attend residencies at the acclaimed Banff Centre (Banff, AB) and Ox-Bow School of Art (Saugatuck, MI). After my Banff residency experience, I made it a goal for myself to attend an established American residency, followed by an international one. With your help, attending this residency will allow me to reach the personal goal that I set for myself last year, which means a great deal to me.  </p>
<p>As a working artist, I was fortunate enough to receive fellowships and scholarships for my residencies last year. The SIM Residency, in Iceland, however, is 100% self-funded. I believe in the importance of artist residencies, as the content and quality of my work is greatly inspired by new environments, people and ideas. It was during my Ox-Bow residency that I first came up with the idea for my <em>Pretty Boys Kill Me </em>drawings, which led to this residency and an upcoming exhibition at Gallery Fukai in Vancouver next spring.</p>

<h3>Pretty Boys Kill Me</h3>
<p>This project explores my interest in the act of looking and appropriation in relation to beauty, love and desire in popular culture while allowing me to continue my examination of portraiture and its place in contemporary art. I will be creating several 26x36 inch coloured pencil drawings of repeat patterns of <em>pretty boys.</em>  The images will be overlaid with text taken from personal e-mails, chats and texts, examining how words are used in communicating desire, wavering between lovingly sentimental and overtly sexual. <span>This continues my investigation into both public and personal histories within my artwork.</span></p>
<p>I am interested in juxtaposing the text with images of these soft-featured men, who have been deified in contemporary culture and art history, as gods, angels and saints are often depicted as androgynous males. The hand drawn execution of the pattern work will teeter between being created lovingly, from a lover's point of view, and somewhat obsessively, not unlike an adolescent girl's fantasies. This project will focus on both process and final product. As the drawings will be labour intensive, I am interested in whether I am able to maintain the same level of obsessive detail or if my drawing capabilities will be affected, thereby alluding to the title of the project.</p>
<h3>Your contributions</h3>
<p>As all expenses related to the residency are paid by the artists, you will be helping me pay for:</p>

<li>Living expenses (food)</li>

</ul>
<p>Every contribution helps, no matter how small, as I will still be paying for my studio/apartment/bills in Vancouver while I am away. I am taking unpaid leave from work to attend this residency, as it is too good an opportunity to pass up. Any extra funds raised over my goal will go towards preparations for my exhibition next year.</p>

It will provide me with uninterrupted studio time, opening up my practice to new concepts about art, therefore advancing my career. </p>

Who we are
We are 15 students from the Rhode Island School of Design and Brown University taking a course this semester called 「Dialogue Across the Diaspora: Haiti, South Africa, Art, and Narratives of Resistance.」 
The course looks at art and stories created in historically catastrophic circumstances. Though they are very different countries with very different histories, both Haiti and South Africa were shaped by slavery and the ensuing racial discrimination.  


What We Are Doing

""Dialogue Across the Diaspora"" literally enacts a dialogue between students at Rhode Island School of Design and Brown University and students at the University of Cape Town, South Africa. Our course is running in conjunction with a course Professor Anthony Bogues (Brown University) is teaching at the Centre for African Studies at the University of Cape Town (http://www.africanstudies.uct.ac.za). Together with the South African students we are conducting research in support of an exhibition that we all curate together called 「Ships of Bondage」, which will be put up at the Slave Lodge Museum in Cape Town, South Africa (http://www.iziko.org.za/museums/slave-lodge) in late November 2013. 
「Ships of Bondage」 will examine the global networks involved in the African slave trade, looking at the connections between Rhode Island, Haiti, and South Africa. It will tell the story of slave insurrections during the slave trade, exploring the struggle of the enslaved to resist captivity, gain freedom, and return to their homelands. 
This is an unprecedented opportunity for all of us and for the Slave Lodge museum, as this will be the first exhibit in South Africa to involve a comparative study of slavery and its legacies in North America , the Caribbean, and Africa.
But there's more and that's where you come in.


WHY WE NEED YOUR HELPWe have the chance to go to Cape Town, South Africa, to meet the students at the University of Cape town, and together personally install the exhibition!
Your donation can make this happen for the entire class.
And since we are artists, we will send you a handcrafted thank you present. Maybe a watercolor of the Slave Lodge. Or a photograph of Table Mountain at dusk. It's all up to you!
To travel to South Africa and meet the students we have been collaborating with online, to see South Africa for ourselves, to go to Robben Island, and stand where Nelson Mandela and hundreds of other people were imprisoned for believing the color of one's skin should not be a bar to equality…
These would be life-changing opportunities for all of us.
So, if you can help us out, please do!! And we will say thank you in the best way we know how - by spreading gifts of knowledge, art, and creativity across the world!

<p>And yet Wanyu, Sane and Jak are unable to work, much. Why? Because vital ingredients of their profession such as oil paints, acrylics, canvas and brushes are difficult to find in many parts of Africa. And when they find some in stock, the stuff cost an arm and a leg; a mighty drain on their earnings. </p>

On that fateful September day in New York, Sane Wadu, in far away Kenya, sat transfixed by the horror on his TV screen, as people jumped from windows of the Twin Towers, preferring quicker death to the inferno engulfing them. That night, Sane feverishly set to work on a canvas. The result is one of the most trenchant, pathos suffused of his oeuvres to date: <i>9/11 New York.</i><span>  “It belongs to the brave people of New York,” he said, adding, “I’ve been waiting all these years for the mayor to come for it for City Hall - or for someone in America to own it.” </span><br/></p>

With paints, acrylics, canvas, brushes, paletteknives, etc - shipped to them in Kenya
 
I am Ghanaian Osei G. Kofi. I am passionate about art. Especially contemporary art out of Africa. I became a collector of sorts during my travels. I mentored a few artists in Eastern Africa, some of whom made it into international limelight. I would like to introduce to you some of my former protégés who like me today are, well, gentlemen of a certain age!
                    Wanyu Brush, Sane Wadu & Jak Katarikawe
Kenyans Wanyu Brush and Sane Wadu and Ugandan Jak Katarikawe are self-taught artists. They have achieved international fame with their art: contemporary, homegrown, and in the best traditions of fine art. Their masterpieces hang in of some of the world’s best museums and in private collections.


And yet Wanyu, Sane and Jak are unable to work, much. Why? Because vital ingredients of their profession such as oil paints, acrylics, canvas and brushes are difficult to find in many parts of Africa. And when they find some in stock, the stuff cost an arm and a leg; a mighty drain on their earnings. 
Wanyu , Sane and Jak are desperate for supplies to be shipped to them in East Africa – so they can continue to create art – which to them is like breathing.

I am here at Indiegogo to crowd source and raise 15,000 US dollars, to cover a year’s supply of canvas, oils, acrylics, thinners, stretcher bars, brushes, palette knives, etc, for Wanyu, Sane and Jak and some of their colleagues.
In Their Own Words … 

Sane Wadu, 55, “I don’t mind when I go hungry. But I go nuts when I can’t find canvas or paint, to release these angels, or wild things constantly screaming inside me, demanding that I set them free!!” Sane says. He was once nicknamed “Insane” by neighbours in his hometown in Central Kenya after he grew a beard and resigned his elementary school teacher’s job, in order to paint fulltime. Years later the neighbours changed their moniker to “Sane” when they saw “important people” drive to the village asking for “Mr Wadu”, to buy his art.

<p><span><b>Who We Are:</b></span></p>
<p>We are Eclectic, an artist co-op, located in the heart of Downtown Urbana. We have been here since March of 2010. We serve as a hub for local artists to connect with one another and share their diverse work with the community. The idea is simple: we want to make art accessible to anyone and everyone by redefining who is allowed to be creative. Everything in the store is made by artists who are everyday people who love keeping their creative passions alive.</p>
<p>During the past few months, there have been many developments <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">to bring new businesses to the downtown area.  We are very excited to welcome our new neighbors and to collaborate in the revitalization of Downtown Urbana. We recognize that one key ingredient in the process of revitalization is creativity, which is something we see throughout the businesses in the downtown area. But another key component of revitalization is community support. We are asking for our community to support us as we are recovering from the hard times we have faced as a result of the construction in Downtown Urbana.  We are looking to raise $16,000 to keep our store open - $8500 of which we hope to raise through Indiegogo.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The strength of our community of artists is demonstrated by the fact that they have donated their art for our fundraising art sales and have paid for memberships six months in advance to raise $4500.

<p><b>The Need:</b></p>
<p>This leaves $8500 more to be raised through Indiegogo in order for our local artists to continue sharing their creative work with the community. If we fail to reach our goal, we will have to face the reality of closing our doors before being able to reap the benefits of all the hard work being done to revitalize our downtown.</p>
<p>So we are turning to you, our community, for support.</p>
<p>The $8500 will specifically cover our past due artist commissions, which they have patiently deferred to keep Eclectic afloat through the revitalization process.  Combined with the funds we have already raised, this will cover rent and overhead and carry us to the Holiday season.  </p>
<p><b>The Perks</b></p>
<p>To say thank you for helping us, our artists have pulled together and created some terrific perks. These perks can be a special something for yourself or be given as a gift to a loved one or friend! <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We've posted the perks on the sidebar, but check out the photos below to see the kind of local art pieces you will receive for partnering with us!</span></p>

action.  It fuels all parts of me, and brings the best that I can offer 
to the world while I am alive on this planet.  For over twenty years, I have been a pioneer in the field of collaborative art and founder of FingerSmears (my signature method of collaborative painting). <br/> I am fiercely dedicated to the use of art for social change, and I understand that the empowerment of girls - particularly in impoverished areas, is the first step in creating lasting change to end the cycle of poverty.   I am also a professional fine art painter, absorbed in the study of classical oil painting.  Making art inspires me. <br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444130819/qpdq2tqfw311eejeomxz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<div style=""text-align: left;"">
<p></p>In my two decades of creating collaborative art FingerSmears™ I have had over 80,000 people stick their fingers in paint to contribute to my community focused FingerSmear™ paintings. Through MIGHTY FINGERS FACING CHANGE, I happily combine my FingerSmear™ work with my fine art by offering my talent and experience to help empower the next generation of change-makers.  We have produced this fun, empowering, collaborative project in six locations around the world so far; Quetzaltenango, Guatemala - Edmonton, Canada, - San Francisco CA, Jackson WY, Port-Au-Prince and Jacmel, Haiti, and Santa Caloma, Spain.  This campaign will help bring Mighty Fingers Facing Change to location number 7 - Uganda in December of 2015. Please join us as we engage, create, and celebrate the power of these mighty fingers to transform their village through art and education.  <br/><p></p>

We will be bringing Mighty Fingers Facing Change to Amor Village in Uganda to work with The Pearl Community Empowerment Foundation: a non-profit grassroots organization dedicated to empowering rural African
 communities to take charge of their own development and break the cycle
 of poverty. This campaign will help us cover production expenses, supplies, documentation, accommodations, and it will also help to outfit the village's first school house.  This six room building has been built from handmade bricks and the labor of the village to help ensure a better future for their children. They are working hard to finish the roof and plaster the walls for our arrival.  We want to help purchase the 150 desks that will serve them for generations.  We will also be bringing school supplies and art supplies.

<p>In each location we use art to empower.  We have conversations about community, our place in it, our opinions about it, and our visions for it.  We use words and symbols to encourage creative thought.  We listen, and we guide.  The girls come to know themselves more deeply, and discover their own might.  They create a self-portrait based on that experience. They build critical thinking skills by using paint and their fingers to  translate their feelings and dreams into a piece of art that makes a statement about their own beauty and strength.  This self-portrait painting is created on a bag so they can symbolically fill that vessel with poems, letters, school work - whatever inspires them and keeps them on their own path.  <br/></p>

</div></div>","The Mighty Fingers Story

This project is the culmination of many years of travel, witness, and 
action.  It fuels all parts of me, and brings the best that I can offer 
to the world while I am alive on this planet.  For over twenty years, I have been a pioneer in the field of collaborative art and founder of FingerSmears (my signature method of collaborative painting).  I am fiercely dedicated to the use of art for social change, and I understand that the empowerment of girls - particularly in impoverished areas, is the first step in creating lasting change to end the cycle of poverty.   I am also a professional fine art painter, absorbed in the study of classical oil painting.  Making art inspires me. 

In my two decades of creating collaborative art FingerSmears™ I have had over 80,000 people stick their fingers in paint to contribute to my community focused FingerSmear™ paintings. Through MIGHTY FINGERS FACING CHANGE, I happily combine my FingerSmear™ work with my fine art by offering my talent and experience to help empower the next generation of change-makers.  We have produced this fun, empowering, collaborative project in six locations around the world so far; Quetzaltenango, Guatemala - Edmonton, Canada, - San Francisco CA, Jackson WY, Port-Au-Prince and Jacmel, Haiti, and Santa Caloma, Spain.  This campaign will help bring Mighty Fingers Facing Change to location number 7 - Uganda in December of 2015. Please join us as we engage, create, and celebrate the power of these mighty fingers to transform their village through art and education.  


We will be bringing Mighty Fingers Facing Change to Amor Village in Uganda to work with The Pearl Community Empowerment Foundation: a non-profit grassroots organization dedicated to empowering rural African
 communities to take charge of their own development and break the cycle
 of poverty. This campaign will help us cover production expenses, supplies, documentation, accommodations, and it will also help to outfit the village's first school house.  This six room building has been built from handmade bricks and the labor of the village to help ensure a better future for their children. They are working hard to finish the roof and plaster the walls for our arrival.  We want to help purchase the 150 desks that will serve them for generations.  We will also be bringing school supplies and art supplies. Thank you for supporting this project.  We look forward to sharing the experience with all of you.  http://pce-foundation.org/

Education begins early.



Walls go up in the six room school house. 
The Mighty Fingers Self-Portrait Project
In each location we use art to empower.  We have conversations about community, our place in it, our opinions about it, and our visions for it.  We use words and symbols to encourage creative thought.  We listen, and we guide.  The girls come to know themselves more deeply, and discover their own might.  They create a self-portrait based on that experience. They build critical thinking skills by using paint and their fingers to  translate their feelings and dreams into a piece of art that makes a statement about their own beauty and strength.  This self-portrait painting is created on a bag so they can symbolically fill that vessel with poems, letters, school work - whatever inspires them and keeps them on their own path.

As I paint, we will also be documenting the interesting & intimate stories behind each work of art. The climax of our tour will finish with a One Man Art Show at the prestigious Springville Museum Of Art in Central Utah, the paintings of the places we visited and our adventurous stories to tell. I grew up in an artist family...so naturally, visual art is my undying passion. My wife Karen also has family members who are artists., making us like two peas in a pod! The two of us have been offered a great opportunity to live and work in Presque Isle, Maine (  https://www.visitmaine.com/organization/presque-isle-area-chamber-of-commerce?uid=vtm504BC79408E6C1170 ) as an artist in residence for one year. Yes, it is a long way from Utah, but that’s actually great! Why?...because we are going to take our time to drive out to Maine, stopping nearly every day to plein air paint on location from state to state! In case you don’t know what a plein air artist is, the term “en plein air” was coined by the original french impressionists, which simply means to paint out in the open air. They aimed to capture the freshness of the atmosphere and the movement of light. Here's an example of one of my ""en plein air"" studies;At some of the places we stop for a day or two, we will set up an OUTDOOR TRAVELING ART SHOW. More examples of my artwork can be found here ( www.russellricksart.com )Once we get to Maine, I'll be off plein air painting along the timeless Maine coastline, an Amish farmers barn ( http://amishamerica.com/maine-amish/ ), a historic building with unmistakable character, down by a nearby lake or off somewhere else in the New England area. My wife will collect the interesting stories and facts behind each painting. We plan to drive out to Maine in early September 2014, stopping along the way here and there, to paint, collect and discover life in rural America-- the people, their passions and their spirit! We're calling this project Painting the HeART of America Tour! After a year, we will return to our home in the west sometime in August of 2015 to Central Utah, following a different route home and again stopping along the way to paint and gather more of the stories people have to tell. We also plan to blog about our exciting adventures along the way so you can be updated on how our project is progressing ( http://paintingtheheartofamerica.wordpress.com/  ).The efforts of all our hard work will culminate in a One Man Show at the prestigious Springville, Utah Museum of Art in September 9th through October 5th, 2015. http://www.smofa.org The Springville Museum show is firm and our goal is to have 30 of my finest paintings and some of our most charming plein air sketches framed and hung in the famous SMA museum.Contribute, then  get on our mailing list then join us at the Artist Reception opening night of the show. With you on our list we will be sure to let you know the night of the show via special V.I.P. invitation.

<p>Hey!</p>

<p>Soooo.. ehhhhh… uhhh, these things are so hard to start!  I was hoping I wouldn’t have to do this but I’m asking for help with the camper. This entrepreneurial path is still new to me and I’m still learning and this year I encountered a pretty big learning curve with my taxes.  I was told not to talk about my taxes because it’s taboo? But I feel weird not being completely honest with you guys.  It’s not my first year paying income tax but I made more money this year than previous years and I had fewer expenses. I had calculated what I thought my taxes were going to be but I didn’t know about “self employment tax” and well, nearly my entire camper budget was wiped out. I have just about enough money to finish getting the camper ready but I’m hoping to be able to raise some money to get me started on the road. Once I’m on the road I’m hoping the little shop in the camper will make enough money to cover my expenses and it will be self-sufficient.  I believe crowd funding is a phenomenal thing and unfortunately there have been people over the last few years that have abused it and also people who don’t understand it and are ugly towards people that use it this makes it exceptionally difficult to ask for help. I watched Amanda Palmer’s TED Talk a while ago and even though I wasn’t planning to raise money at the time it still really spoke to me. And now that I am asking for help I’m reminding myself of her message and its importance.  This project is about getting connected.  I want to constantly be improving the camper while I’m on the road by stocking up on more art supplies and anything else that will make for better meet ups.  I think I need around $1,500-2,000 to be able to be on the road by the end of the month and to cover expenses for the first 5-7 weeks. This money will go towards putting the finishing touches on the camper, gas, campsites, groceries, etc. Any additional money raised will go towards bettering the camper.  It’s hard to convey what I hope this project will be but based on the feedback I’ve received so far I’m pretty confident most of you share and understand the vision.  If you do donate, thank you a hundred times. I’m so extremely grateful to be able to do what I do and it would be nothing without you guys. </p>
<p>I’M SO EXCITED! See y’all on the road!</p><p>And thank you to Blake (<a href=""https://soundcloud.com/blakeharnage)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://soundcloud.com/blakeharnage)</a> for the music! It made it 100x cuter.</p><p>Also, there is no pastry/confectionery element to this camper. I keep seeing comments about bakery stuff and that's a different dream. It's a dream I still love but I'm not sure if I'll ever pursue it, but maybe it will be what comes after this!</p><p></p></div>","Hey!

And now that I am asking for help I’m reminding myself of her message and its importance.  This project is about getting connected.  I want to constantly be improving the camper while I’m on the road by stocking up on more art supplies and anything else that will make for better meet ups.  I think I need around $1,500-2,000 to be able to be on the road by the end of the month and to cover expenses for the first 5-7 weeks. This money will go towards putting the finishing touches on the camper, gas, campsites, groceries, etc. Any additional money raised will go towards bettering the camper.  It’s hard to convey what I hope this project will be but based on the feedback I’ve received so far I’m pretty confident most of you share and understand the vision.  If you do donate, thank you a hundred times. I’m so extremely grateful to be able to do what I do and it would be nothing without you guys. 
I’M SO EXCITED! See y’all on the road!And thank you to Blake (https://soundcloud.com/blakeharnage) for the music! It made it 100x cuter.Also, there is no pastry/confectionery element to this camper. I keep seeing comments about bakery stuff and that's a different dream. It's a dream I still love but I'm not sure if I'll ever pursue it, but maybe it will be what comes after this!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<b>CONCEPT</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
The
use of technology in the artistic fields leads inevitably to new
forms of experimentation and the rethinking of the traditional ways,
allowing them however to be expressed and valued. <br/>The main
characteristics of technological art are of avoiding to interfere
with its own material support and, because of its digital nature,
replying with images to the actions. Perceived by the spectator these
same images become part of the spectators’ experience background,
feeding the artistic co-creation during the performance itself. The
new art form based on art and technology is generated by the
re-elaboration of different artistic forms, aiming to create a new
dialog in the contemporary art fields. A dialog directed in
researching a new awareness of digital art, that overcame
recreational, scenographic or spectacular approaches.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Titled <i><b>Compositional
Phases</b></i><b>,</b> the fourth edition of Toolkit Festival
will focus on the re-adaptation of the digital piece of art and on
the modularity of the phases that constitute the project.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
What
we ask artists is to put in evidence the different phases of
the project’s elaboration on-site in the Festival’s exposition
spaces. The completed work will have to be, therefore, capable of
expressing and communicating to the visitor at least one of the
aspects that was part of the planning of the artwork and the execution of the different phases: from the technological
re-adaptation of the work to its digital representation version
in the exposition spaces that will host the Festival.</p><b></b><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">All the Association activities are self-funded, free and open to everybody.

Il punto focale su cui si fonda l'azione dell'associazione è l'arte digitale, alla base anche del suo principale progetto, il Toolkit Festival, mirato a sviluppare la creatività, la conoscenza delle arti digitali e forme di co-creazione culturale partecipative.Al Festival, l'Associazione ha affiancato nel tempo altre attività volte a descrivere l’ampio raggio di possibilità espressive contenute nell’arte interattiva, una tipologia di approccio al contemporaneo capace di trascendere i generi e aprirsi a contributi sonori, visivi, plastici e perfomativi in costante mutamento, grazie soprattutto all’uso della tecnologia. Grazie a workshop, talk e tavole rotonde, eventi culturali, Toolkit è riuscito a creare un tessuto di relazioni all'interno del territorio veneziano e tra esso e numerose realtà internazionali.Dal 2013, l'Associazione Culturale Toolkit è iscritta al Registro Comunale delle Associazioni di Venezia, l'Associazione è apartitica, aconfessionale e non ha fini di lucro.                                                 Mauro Ferrario - AudioPaintingVisual (Toolkit 2012)TOOLKIT FESTIVALToolkit Festival vuole porsi come punto di incontro e di riferimento per giovani artisti emergenti (italiani e non) che si muovono nel campo delle arti neomediali.

researching a new awareness of digital art, that overcame
recreational, scenographic or spectacular approaches.

Titled Compositional
Phases, the fourth edition of Toolkit Festival
will focus on the re-adaptation of the digital piece of art and on
the modularity of the phases that constitute the project.

What
we ask artists is to put in evidence the different phases of
the project’s elaboration on-site in the Festival’s exposition
spaces. The completed work will have to be, therefore, capable of
expressing and communicating to the visitor at least one of the
aspects that was part of the planning of the artwork and the execution of the different phases: from the technological
re-adaptation of the work to its digital representation version
in the exposition spaces that will host the Festival.All the Association activities are self-funded, free and open to everybody. Even a small donation will help us sustain the organizational and running expenses of the Festival, and promote young artists from all over the word. All the donations will be fully reinvested in the production of the Festival, to support the expenses of materials, promotion and accomodation of the participating artists. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT Toolkit StaffFor more infos visit our websitewww.toolkitfestival.com                                                          Aurora Meccanica, La Gabbia (Toolkit 2011)",6.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Jinja has so much to offer and best of all is the people of Jinja whom make others feel happy, just by being around them. This is the best medicine to heal the heart and spirit of most people on this planet. The Mayor of Jinja asked <a href=""http://paintingthecitybright.com/big-steve/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""s2"">Big Steve </span></a>to come and help him show of his city to the rest of the world and this is our story.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">We decided that the best way to create awareness of Jinja was to do something that everyone in Jinja could be involved in. The Center piece of this campaign is that everyone would feel welcome and free to take part, or be a part of history happening right on their own door step. The idea developed is open to the entire community, <a href=""http://paintingthecitybright.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Painting The City Bright</a>.

So we made a promise to help the Mayor of Jinja and the people of Uganda to reach out to the world and show that Jinja has a lot to offer and that the People on Jinja are the happiest people in the world. It's time to put Jinja back on the map, and on the right road to success.</span></p>

<p>The program begins with a relay from Jinja to Northern Sweden, where glass bottles shaped like Uganda’s delicious Nile Perch fish and like hippos, will be filled with water from the source of the Nile and then carried, on and adjacent to the Nile, over the Mediterranean and Europe, ending up in Skellefteå in Northen Sweden.</p>
<p>During the trip, there will be a variety of cultural events with music and dance from Jinja. By 2014, the glass bottles are expected to have reached Northern Sweden and will be given to Mayors of various municipalities.</p>
<p>This will be a great opportunity to sell Jinja’s potential because its at that time that the city of Umeå in Västerbotten county in Sweden would have taken over as the European Capital of Culture.</p>

Painting The City Bright will lift the country on the international map. People all over the world will recognise Uganda and Jinja for something beautiful. A great tourist destination, a city with huge business potential, a thriving culture and a lot more.
Most of all Painting The City Bright will inspire and create opportunities for the People of Uganda.
www.paintingthecitybright.com
Jinja has so much to offer and best of all is the people of Jinja whom make others feel happy, just by being around them. This is the best medicine to heal the heart and spirit of most people on this planet. The Mayor of Jinja asked Big Steve to come and help him show of his city to the rest of the world and this is our story.
We decided that the best way to create awareness of Jinja was to do something that everyone in Jinja could be involved in. The Center piece of this campaign is that everyone would feel welcome and free to take part, or be a part of history happening right on their own door step. The idea developed is open to the entire community, Painting The City Bright. This would make Jinja the ‘most colourful city in Africa’ and by taking part, would be something that residents of Jinja could feel proud to be part of.

 Why are we doing this?
This campaign is very important to us, Jinja And UGANDA has been known for a lot of negatives over several years. We all know that every country and City has their negatives, but they also have their Positive. So we made a promise to help the Mayor of Jinja and the people of Uganda to reach out to the world and show that Jinja has a lot to offer and that the People on Jinja are the happiest people in the world. It's time to put Jinja back on the map, and on the right road to success.
We are all volunteers working on this project, the money we are asking for all goes to covering expenses to bring the team of 12 to the equator. And to help out with all the expenses these 3 BIG events will cost.
 

The Events Happening in MAY.
May 4 2013 – Big Hearts Create Big Smiles #bhcbs2013

The program begins with a relay from Jinja to Northern Sweden, where glass bottles shaped like Uganda’s delicious Nile Perch fish and like hippos, will be filled with water from the source of the Nile and then carried, on and adjacent to the Nile, over the Mediterranean and Europe, ending up in Skellefteå in Northen Sweden.
During the trip, there will be a variety of cultural events with music and dance from Jinja. By 2014, the glass bottles are expected to have reached Northern Sweden and will be given to Mayors of various municipalities.
This will be a great opportunity to sell Jinja’s potential because its at that time that the city of Umeå in Västerbotten county in Sweden would have taken over as the European Capital of Culture.
 
11 May 2013 – African Ice Swimming Championships

History will be written in Jinja, when The First African Ice Swimming Championship is staged, an event that officials of Jinja Municipal Council have said will be like bringing the polar circle to the equator. Jinja residents have been inspired to undertake this from the city of Skellefteå in Northern Sweden, where, for the last two years both The Swedish and Scandinavian championship in winter swimming were held.
The water temperature in the swimming pool will be lowered to about 10 ° C, a rare phenomenon at the equator, for the championship to take place. Both individual races and relays are on the program.

I’m a fine art photographer based in Maine.  I’ve got the same laundry list of ridiculous day jobs (that thankfully I don’t work at anymore) that most artists have as well as a <a href=""http://www.tanjaalexiahollander.com/resume.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">resume</a>  (if you’re into that kind of thing) of all my artistic achievements.<br/><br/><strong>Q.  Are you really photographing all your friends on Facebook?</strong><br/>A. Yes! I made a spread sheet of where everyone lived on February 24, 2011. At that time I had 626 friends, and I am off to photograph them all!  I’ve traveled to 15 states, photographed over 250 people,  made <a href=""http://www.facebookportraitproject.com/search/label/portrait"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">168 portraits</a>, received<a href=""http://www.facebookportraitproject.com/p/press.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> international press</a> and transformed the project from one that existed only on the internet to an exhibition at the <a href=""http://www.portlandmuseum.org/exhibitions-collections/past.shtml"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Portland Museum of Art</a></p>
<p><strong>Q.  That is a lot of people and traveling, how have you funded it so far?</strong><br/>A. It has been almost entirely crowd funded by <a href=""http://www.tanjaalexiahollander.com/invest.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">you (150+ !!)</a> with a little grant money and a part time day job.</p>
<p><strong>Q.  I want to know more about this, do you have a statement?</strong><br/>A.  Yes!   I have posted the <a href=""http://www.facebookportraitproject.com/p/about.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">about statement</a> and <a href=""http://www.facebookportraitproject.com/p/press-release.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">press releases</a>.  I have also done a ton of <a href=""http://www.facebookportraitproject.com/p/press.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interviews</a> which tend to be more up to date on my thoughts, since I'm continually learning from the process. You can read, watch or listen. </p>
<p><strong>Q.  Wow, what an adventure you’re on.   How can I be part of this?</strong><br/>A.  You can donate your cold hard cash to the project.  I have so many great things to offer as incentives:  I'll send you a postcard from the road, give you any photograph you want,  I'll add you to the project, I'll talk to you, your business or school about the project, social media or photography. I've got Portland Museum of Art <a href=""https://picasaweb.google.com/117587507685140478916/PMAMerchandise?authuser=0&amp;feat=directlink"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">merchandise</a> &amp; exhibition mementos.   For $125, I am giving away your choice of <a href=""https://picasaweb.google.com/117587507685140478916/Magnets"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">10x10"" magnets</a> from the exhibition.  I am also committed to re-investing 10% of my income back into the arts community.  My work would not be possible if I wasn't surrounded by amazingly inspiring &amp; talented artists.  <a href=""https://picasaweb.google.com/117587507685140478916/PerksFromFriends?authuser=0&amp;feat=directlink"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Here is a sampling</a> of the great things from my friends I am including for contributions of $50 or more.</p>

Contributions for the purposes of Are you really my friend? must be made payable to Fractured Atlas and are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law.   <br/><br/><strong>AND</strong>, even if you can’t invest cold hard cash, please take a few minutes to spread the word on your social media platform of choice and by e-mailing all your friends!  Especially your friends that work at Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>Q.   This project is so awesome, I want to underwrite the whole thing.  Will $100, 000 cover it?  Where should I send the check?</strong><br/>A.   First, thank you so much for understanding awesome costs money (as my friend Jenny would say).  And second, I think 100K just might do it.  It will certainly cover the next year.  You don’t have to send it, I’d love to pick up the check and thank you personally for being so awesome yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Q.  I’m getting tired of all your fundraisers.  Can’t you just get a real job and leave us all alone?</strong><br/>A.  Me too.   And NO.<br/><br/><strong>Q.   I really love your landscape work, but want to support this project.  Can I choose a landscape as one of my incentives?</strong><br/>A.  YES!  You can choose whatever you want from any of my photographs.  Maybe it’s a mobile upload from <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/are.you.really.my.friend"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a>, <a href=""http://instagram.com/p/gN817/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Instagram</a>, <a href=""http://www.facebookportraitproject.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">my blog</a>, or <a href=""http://www.tanjaalexiahollander.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a>.  My online world is your oyster.</p>
<p><strong>Q.  I want a $1, 000 incentive but can’t afford it all at once, would you consider a payment plan?</strong><br/>A.  Unfortunately there is not a way to set that up for this campaign.  But if you <a href=""mailto:tanja@tanjaalexiahollander.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">e-mail</a> me your thoughts, I will try and work with you.   I am all about making art affordable.</p>
<p><strong>Q.  I am asked to donate to a lot of causes, why should I donate to yours?</strong><br/>A.    I want to talk about language before I answer that question.   I like to think of this cause as investing in my future.  You are giving me money, and I am giving you my art.  If you are giving me straight up cash and taking the tax write off, then you are making a donation.  Back to why you should invest.  You should invest because you think my work has value.  Because you think this project has value.  Because you think my time should be spent making beautiful things and sharing them with the world.   The bottom line is I am out of funds to continue this project, so any amount you can contribute brings me one step closer to making another photograph.<br/><br/><strong>Q.   $60, 000 seems a lot of money.  Why don’t you set a more realistic goal?</strong><br/>A.  You’re totally right.  Unfortunately (or fortunately), I’ve never been one to set realistic goals.  I have raised 50K over the last year, so I believe it’s possible.  It has been difficult to fundraise and make the work at the same time, so I want to dedicate myself to fundraising for one month and then be able to work for a year uninterrupted.<br/><br/><strong>Q.   What are you going to with all the money you raise?  I’m crunching some numbers in my head and I can’t see how you could possibly need this much money.</strong><br/>A.  That’s a good question, obviously.   I’ll tell you right now, the first thing I’m going to buy is 300 rolls of film before they discontinue film completely.  I am also going to buy a new computer.  My 2006 Macbook is barely hanging on.  And in the tradition of full disclosure, I have made my budget a <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuzTEgnMW2M0dHYyMjBTb0wxbGNFQUpETjVBMk9qUGc#gid=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">public spreadsheet </a>and will track the projects income &amp; expenses for you to see.   I will at minimum be updating it monthly.<br/><br/><strong>Q.   I think it’s reasonable to ask for your expenses, but why should I pay for your salary, that seems crazy?</strong><br/>A.   Truth be told, photography is expensive, and so is travel.  But actually the most expensive line item,  my time, is my most valuable asset.  Artists are told over and over again that their time is not valuable, I would like to break that cycle of thinking.</p>
<p><strong>Q.  It's so great the Portland Museum of Art exhibited the project and is adding passes, membership &amp; merchadise to your incentives.  Are you going to give them a photograph for thier collection?</strong><br/>A.  If this campaign is successful, I will archive the <strong>entire</strong> project at the Portland Museum of Art.   Every time the piece is exhibited, the wall label will have your name on it.   I think it could be the largest crowd funded Museum acquisition in history.</p>
<p><strong>Q.  What happens if you exceed your fundraising goal?</strong><br/>A.  Another great question.  This budget is for a year, however it could take much longer, any extra money will be used to bring the project to fruition.  I would also lke to hire assistants to help with scheduling, post production and promotion.  I have grand ideas of creating a book, which is a very expensive task.</p>
<p><strong>Q.  It seems that you are having a great time making this work.  You get to see your old friends, make new ones, eat &amp; drink, go to Museums, and travel all the time.   Why should I fund you to go on vacation? I’m jealous, I want your experiences.</strong><br/>A.  It’s true!  I am having a lot of fun.  I love what I am doing.  And everyone, including you should love what they do for work and have fun doing it.    This project is also really hard work and has consumed my whole life (in the best possible way).  It can be exhausting and emotionally draining as well.   But back to the fun part, you shouldn’t be jealous.  Quit your job, hit the road, do you what you love!</p>
<p><strong>Q.  How long will it take you to finish the project?</strong><br/>A.   I think about a year.   It is really hard for me to estimate because at times the project takes on a life of its own and spins in many different directions.   I am creeping close to the half way mark and I have been at it a little over a year.  I was working part time during that time period and launching multiple fundraisers, and also took four months off of shooting to prepare and install the exhibition at the Portland Museum of Art.   <br/><br/><strong>Q.  You must have some good stories to tell.  Are your writing about this?</strong><br/>A.  Yes!  This project has taken me to see many people &amp; places I would never of imagined visiting.  I am documenting it all on my <a href=""http://www.facebookportraitproject.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blog</a> which I am starting to realize is as important as the finished portrait.   It’s modern day journal of our collective histories.   <br/><br/><strong>Q.   Do you have Facebook friends that you haven’t met in real life?</strong><br/>A. Yes!  In fact, on a recent trip to Houston, I stayed with one.   She welcomed me, left me the keys to her place and said maker your self at home.  I am learning how amazing we all are, how we form communities and support each other, how we are inherently kind and generous.<br/><strong><br/>Q. Why are you going to their homes? It seems like the easy thing to do would be to rent a studio and have every one come to you.</strong><br/>A. I know, right?  Sometimes I really wish I was one of those people that could do things the easy way.   This project is an exploration into friendship, and to me a friend is someone you share a meal with and have heated discussions after a few bottles of wine.  So, it's a huge part of the project that I go and visit with friends in their own environments.<br/><br/><strong>Q.  Where is the farthest you have gone and where is the farthest you will go?</strong><br/>A.   The farthest I’ve been is Los Angeles and the farthest place I have to go is Auckland, New Zealand.  Which is WHY I’m asking for your help now.  I plan to do it one fell swoop, by crossing the Atlantic to Africa and then stopping in Europe, the Middle East, Asia and New Zealand and back around across the Pacific.<br/><br/><strong>Q.  How are you going to schedule that?</strong><br/>A.  I have no idea, it is giving me a little anxiety just thinking about it.  It is hard enough to plan in American cities, I can't imagine what it will be like in foreign languages.</p>
<p><strong>Q.  How long do you think it will take you to go all the way around the world?</strong><br/>A.  If I don't stop to see the sights, I could probably do it in a month.  I would like to allot myself about four months (hopefully leaving Maine for the winter) to really see the world. And of course, show and tell you all about it.<br/><br/><strong>Q.   What do your days look like?  How much time do you spend shooting vs. travelling vs. promotion vs. production?</strong><br/>A.  That is a great question.  My days have been very long, usually around 12-14 hours, 7 days a week.  I'd like to get them down to 10 hours!  I wondered the same thing myself when I was putting this campaign together.  I decided to start tracking my time on this public <a href=""https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=d5mqfjrle5vfv14mn2mcnij4nc%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=America/New_York"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">calendar</a> so you can see in real time.   Over the past year, I averaged about two weeks a month travelling/shooting, and the other two post production (scanning, blogging, printing).   It feels like the blogging is the most time consuming part but maybe that’s just because it is the hardest.</p>

<p>Like many Chinese families, my parents like to compare me with other kids all the time. I always think there is nothing I can do in life will ever please them and make them proud of me. I remember one thing my parents constantly told me is that dream can’t buy you food.  You have to get a stable job that provides you security.  Don’t chase after something that won’t earn you money.<strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.25370158161967993""><br/><br/></strong></p>
<h3><strong>Praying for Change</strong></h3>
<p>My life is simple and routine.  I have a full time job which I have worked for 10 years.  However, I do not enjoy it at all.  No passion.  No satisfaction.  I know that I have talent and passion for art; however, I do not dare to pursue it.  So life went on, but I was not happy at all.  Last October, I started to pray for a change to happen.  I wanted to do something different, most importantly something I enjoy doing.  God has answered my prayer. Instead of giving me a new job, He gave me a talent and passion to sew.  Something I have never thought of doing before but now I just fall in love with it.  It is such an amazing and a rewarding experience to know that people like my felted goods.  I never knew that I can do something to touch and inspire people like this with my hands. From then I knew my courage is back. And it's time to chase after the long forgetten dreams …<strong><br/><br/></strong></p>
<h3><strong>Making My Dream Comes True</strong></h3>
<p>One of my dreams is to open an art gallery to exhibit my art works. I believe it’s not only my dream, but it’s also a dream for every artists out there. Through my works, I want to tell people about my story, what I see and what inspires me in life. Therefore, I am asking for your help.

children and adults housed in a vintage Airstream trailer.  Being mobile
will allow us to provide limitless opportunities in art education. Go Art Go
will travel to schools to provide enriching after-school programs in art
education. It can be parked in neighborhoods for parents who are looking for creative
summer craft camps for their kids. The Go Art Go trailer can also be for rented
for private functions, baby showers, playdates, seasonal workshops and even
girls night out. The mobile art school is not limited to one geographical
region. Go Art Go will travel to festivals and events all over the state of
Texas and beyond, offering our unique experience in art making.</span></p>
<p>The
Go Art Go trailer will also house a retail store, where our customers can
purchase items such as handmade art smocks, supply organizers and unique art
materials. These products will also be available in our online store. </p>
<p>Go Art Go is
more than about making crafty items or pretty paintings. Here, art is about
discovering a personal vision through the creative journey. Learning about and
making art is process-focused, rather than seen as a deliverable or end
product. It is also about building a stronger community, collaborating creatively
and encouraging people of all ages and levels of expertise to inspire
one another. </p>
<p>The arts create
identity and character by bringing people and neighborhoods together through a
shared desire to create beautiful things. It inspires us to communicate in
other ways besides words, which results in the bridging of cultures, ethnicity,
religion, and age. It builds confidence, dedication and perseverance.
Bryan/College Station is the perfect location to build a space that will foster
this type of growth. </p>
<p>Bryan/College
Station, Texas is a thriving town, home to historic neighborhoods and new
developments, both offering a diverse selection of retail, restaurants, art
galleries and entertainment venues. It is a distinct community, rich in
tradition and at the same time characterized by the globally aware,
highly-educated population that makes up Texas A&amp;M University. It is a
wonderful place to live; however, this little town is missing something that I
believe is vital to the exuberant spirit of its community. It is in great need
of an art school and gathering place to nurture the creative hearts of the
people who make up B/CS. </p>
<p>Go Art Go is the
solution.</p>
<h1><b>Background</b></h1>
<p>For the past year
and a half, I have spent time running a mobile art school out of the trunk of
my car, lugging around all of my art supplies to each location. Super fun, but,
not always an easy thing to do! It's pretty challenging trying to stay
organized and remember what to bring to each class. Having a larger, designated
space will allow me to provide better instruction, more time and services to my
clients.  </p>
<p>My classes are
sought-after and book up quickly. I have been told by many residents of the
area that there is a need for more unique choices in art education in BCS. There
is especially a need for more options for younger children. There are not many
options in the B/CS area for acquiring unique art materials. Artists of all
ages need options for creative tools beyond what the corporate retailers are providing.

<p>I have created a new series of Prints and Apparel constructing the Perpetual Propaganda Collection.  The essence of the collection draws influence from propaganda, photography and global symbols.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My mission is to level the global market by platforming individuals to an equal echelon.  Creating a new standard for humanity based in progression, rooted in culture, shaped by art, and balanced by technology.  The aim is to teach others to embrace a variety
of perspectives and perceptions while simultaneously destroying hate.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In modern times we exist in a
globalizing market with increasing collaboration between nations.   The world is becoming more transparent exposing our similarities as people while our differences remain beautiful and unique.  As a result of globalization borders dividing different cultures continue to fade and diminish.  This concept is evident in an increase in trade volume between countries in context of goods and products.  </p>
<p>By circulating goods and products throughout the world consequently culture and
ideology are also distributed.  This has been made possible by the internet and social media applications.  By combining the internet’s reach with a social initiative the web has evolved into a cultural hub.  <span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Little over 3 billion people (almost half the world population) have access to the internet allowing them to constantly share information.  More specifically individuals are sharing culture.  </span></p>
<p><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Culture in the context of this global analysis can be defined as language, art, literature, religion, music, apparel and food.   The effect this has had is present in humanity’s desire to know more about each other.  This thirst for understanding is only quenchable through cultural experience. </span></p>
<p>Using art I hope to
communicate this observation of the world through a dynamic set of mediums including graphic art, silkscreened prints and video. The
goal is to produce art that will inspire further destruction of the walls that divide us.</p>

several projects that are waiting to be initiated.  Specifically I have
hopes of pursuing a public arts project involving wheat pasting original art in the Greater Pittsburgh Area. In addition receiving these funds will
allow me to platform my apparel production.  I would gain the monetary
resources needed to begin a regular production cycle.  Ultimately I would use this
asset to further my artistic development and push toward my potential.

</div></div>","Short Summary 
I have created a new series of Prints and Apparel constructing the Perpetual Propaganda Collection.  The essence of the collection draws influence from propaganda, photography and global symbols.

My mission is to level the global market by platforming individuals to an equal echelon.  Creating a new standard for humanity based in progression, rooted in culture, shaped by art, and balanced by technology.  The aim is to teach others to embrace a variety
of perspectives and perceptions while simultaneously destroying hate.

In modern times we exist in a
globalizing market with increasing collaboration between nations.   The world is becoming more transparent exposing our similarities as people while our differences remain beautiful and unique.  As a result of globalization borders dividing different cultures continue to fade and diminish.  This concept is evident in an increase in trade volume between countries in context of goods and products.  
By circulating goods and products throughout the world consequently culture and
ideology are also distributed.  This has been made possible by the internet and social media applications.  By combining the internet’s reach with a social initiative the web has evolved into a cultural hub.  Little over 3 billion people (almost half the world population) have access to the internet allowing them to constantly share information.  More specifically individuals are sharing culture.  
Culture in the context of this global analysis can be defined as language, art, literature, religion, music, apparel and food.   The effect this has had is present in humanity’s desire to know more about each other.  This thirst for understanding is only quenchable through cultural experience. 
Using art I hope to
communicate this observation of the world through a dynamic set of mediums including graphic art, silkscreened prints and video. The
goal is to produce art that will inspire further destruction of the walls that divide us.

<p>    Another year has past since the last great pilgrimage to Austria to attend and compete at the WBF. A place where Artists from all across the globe and all walks of life converge to share their imagination.  For the last two years we have traveled as a team to compete and to learn from other amazing artists. This year is no different.  If you are familiar with our campaigns you know these trips are no stranger to adventure and usually ends with a great story.Our previous journeys have included lost passports, hidden music festivals, being stranded atop of a mountain, and going out to represent the Festival on a boat!  Each competition holds the keys to a new exciting tale of excitement and adventure . Most importantly this campaign helps an artist further themselves both in skill and knowledge. That artist is me…. Rudy Zanzibar Campos. </p>

I am a full time artist and blessed to be that. Everything I do goes back into my art and into my cost of living such as bills.

<h3>My success is through the generosity of others.</h3>
<div> The impact your sponsorship has brought and will bring is more than you can possibly imagine. It is because of you that I am able to be the artist I am today and will become in the future. Being able to make this trip and network with artists and art lovers from all over the globe has opened a multitude of doors that I never existed when I first started painting. Every thread in the fabric of my life has lead to new things. One thread helped me learn a new skill, one thread got me on television, one thread allowed me to represent the WBF for the United Nations.  Each sponsor is a thread and together you are helping me weave the path of my life. </div>

Last year I learned a lot about my self as a person when I came placed last in my category.  Sometimes that happens. It was quite a blow from being placed 6th  the previous year to dead last. Yet we held our heads high and continued to paint on the second day not just for ourselves but for the people who helped us get to Austria. We presented or piece through out the festival. We made new friends and fans because of our piece. Even though we did not place where we wanted to fate opened other doors for us.  You sponsorship isn't a guarantee that we'll walk away with a gold medal but a promise that we'll take our art and imagination to be seen.</div>

</div></div>","The World Bodypainting Festival 2016 
       
    Another year has past since the last great pilgrimage to Austria to attend and compete at the WBF. A place where Artists from all across the globe and all walks of life converge to share their imagination.  For the last two years we have traveled as a team to compete and to learn from other amazing artists. This year is no different.  If you are familiar with our campaigns you know these trips are no stranger to adventure and usually ends with a great story.Our previous journeys have included lost passports, hidden music festivals, being stranded atop of a mountain, and going out to represent the Festival on a boat!  Each competition holds the keys to a new exciting tale of excitement and adventure . Most importantly this campaign helps an artist further themselves both in skill and knowledge. That artist is me…. Rudy Zanzibar Campos. 

 2015 was an exciting year for me! I had the opportunity to be on the smash hit show ""SKIN WARS"" 



""Skin Wars"" Season 2 

Skins Wars was an amazing experience! Surrounded by body painters of all walks of life and skill levels was awe inspiring. I took away a great deal knowledge in new skills from the short time that I was on the show. I was of course saddened when it was time for me leave my Skin Wars family but from my loss I challenged myself to become better at Camouflage body paint. 



 
JW Marriott 2016 Blended Beauty 
The World Bodypainting Festival 2015 was another great event! That summer I had there privilege to teach again at the WB Academy . As well as take a class or two from other  super talented instructors. That trip was the best yet and opened the door for me to represent the WBF in Korea.


 Getting to go to South Korea was absolutely wonderful! I was able to to teach students of another culture. In the process I they taught me how to teach in a different part of the world. I was also honored to represent The WB Production and the US in working with the United Nations in South Korea. Along with other painters we provided body art installations to the Korean War Memorial Building in Seoul.






Its 2016 now and the festival is right around the corner, preparations are half way done to being compete. This year our team was going to fund the whole trip ourselves without the help of sponors. Due to one or two bumps in the road of life we have been set back slightly on our goal. I am a full time artist and blessed to be that. Everything I do goes back into my art and into my cost of living such as bills. It is with the support of sponors and art lovers that we can turn this trip into reality.   I am asking  the assistance of patrons, fans , and friends  to achieve the goal of getting to the World Bodypainting Festival. 






  What Your Team Needs     
The team has 70% of the trip in the bag! Awesome! What we have already achieved is our Airfare to Austria, Supplies to complete look of the competition piece, and Our room and board at the festival.  
   What we are needing help with and where the funds will be going are towards
   ~ Hostel stay for a group from Vienna to Portschach 
   ~ Train Fare to the Festival 
   ~ Baggage/Shipping fees
   ~ Incidentals while traveling
       ~ Perks for Indiegogo campaign 
   ~ Indiegogo and Paypal Service Fees 

Meet the Team!


 Rudy Zanzibar Campos                 Madeline Kiley 




My success is through the generosity of others.
 The impact your sponsorship has brought and will bring is more than you can possibly imagine. It is because of you that I am able to be the artist I am today and will become in the future. Being able to make this trip and network with artists and art lovers from all over the globe has opened a multitude of doors that I never existed when I first started painting. Every thread in the fabric of my life has lead to new things. One thread helped me learn a new skill, one thread got me on television, one thread allowed me to represent the WBF for the United Nations.  Each sponsor is a thread and together you are helping me weave the path of my life. 





   Every road has its risks! Caution ahead!



      As with any competition there is risk involved. Getting there is only a part of the challenge. Last year I learned a lot about my self as a person when I came placed last in my category.  Sometimes that happens. It was quite a blow from being placed 6th  the previous year to dead last. Yet we held our heads high and continued to paint on the second day not just for ourselves but for the people who helped us get to Austria. We presented or piece through out the festival. We made new friends and fans because of our piece. Even though we did not place where we wanted to fate opened other doors for us.  You sponsorship isn't a guarantee that we'll walk away with a gold medal but a promise that we'll take our art and imagination to be seen.

                Help us spread the word. 

 Monetary contributions are not the only ways to help Team Rcc!  Help spread the word on your Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat!  We have less than 20 days to get ready and your team needs you. Have an extra hour or two you can spare in the workshop? We'll take it!  
 We are also collecting some tools if you have a spare to donate.  If you have any of this stuff laying around taking space. Before you throw it out give us a call!

<p>1. If you're a coach and you're interested in the <b>FILLABLE PDF version</b>, please notice that we have the strongest desire to deliver this version to you. However, creating a fillable PDF of this kind take a lot of time (around 100 hours), so we will only create this version if, at least 20 orders will be placed.

<p>2. <b>The leather bound refillable Navigator </b>is coming with its risks as well: manufacturing and shipping. However, over the last months we have been working on getting the best possible prices and most quality shipping possible. To keep the production under control, and also to save on manufacturing costs, we have decided to do the assembling ourselves, and to only outsource the essential parts of the navigators like:</p>
<ul>
<li>the leather cover will be custom made</li>
<li>the cover will be cut to shape in a small factory<br/>
</li>
<li>the features will be custom made and delivered to us<br/>
</li>
</ul>Challenges usually may come up in the production process, however as architects we are always ready for it. We aim to have the navigators shipped to you in July, or in worse case scenario by August, just in time for you to plan on it starting with September. <br/><br/>This is the very first public version of the navigators, and even though we did everything in our power to be the perfect book ever, we might have missed some details. So please drop me an email any time you feel there is something unclear about using the navigator or, if you want something more out of it. Our plan is to design even better versions of it, over the next 3 years, so your feedback will be highly appreciated.<br/><br/>We are decided to being transparent during this whole campaign, and long after it.

The Shahan
Natalie Family Foundation, Inc. (SNFF), a California-based non-profit 501(c)(3)
organization is embarking upon a new program of cultural outreach. The objective
of the program is to introduce the treasures of Armenia to the world by
bringing artists, experts, scholars, scientists and other professionals to the
United States to share their knowledge with the Armenian and non-Armenian
communities. The lectures they present will be recorded and made available on
DVD and also via the Internet in order to reach local, national, and international

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to put the show together, Ron needs the supplies and stability to work full-time. He works in pencil – primarily black or white graphite, but with some color on occasion – and he'll need drawing paper.</p>
<p>He will need the stability of covering his housing, food and utility bills to work full-time through the summer to have the show in autumn. Your support will also provide for promotional materials and a formal launch of the show.</p>

<p>My name is William (Billy to my friends) and I have always dreamed of making a second income from art, but I have yet to push the art that I do to that next level. Hope rose up when a friend gave me a copy of “Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.” Reading through and following the exercises improved my work and I saw potential in my work that it might move forward with some direct instruction. Unfortunately, all the “Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain” workshops were too far away, until now!<span>  The workshop has finally come to Austin.  </span></p>
<p><a rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></p>
<p><span>The “Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain workshop” is a five day intensive drawing class</span>.This class has proven that the global skill of drawing any perceived object, person, or place requires five basic component perceptual skills. These skills are the perception of edges, spaces, relationships, lights and shadows, and the whole or gestalt. Like other global or whole skills, such as reading and driving where each skill is learned and merged with the others until you are simply preforming the act, Drawing can be taught the same way.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Classes are held for 5 consecutive days for 8 hours each day from May 15<sup>th</sup> to May 19<sup>th</sup></p>
<p><b>--Day One</b> starts with a lecture on the principles of brain hemisphere management, followed by students copying a Picasso drawing upside-down. This exercise gives the brain a task that the left hemisphere will turn down and the drawings will therefore be perceptual rather than symbolic. Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain is all about turning off the left hemisphere or giving the brain a task that the left hemisphere cannot do therefore allowing the right perceptual side of the brain to take over. Later in the day we experiment with blind contour drawings to enable us to slow down our vision and tap into the right hemisphere.</p>
<p><b>--Day Two</b> starts with a lecture discussing the use of the picture plane followed by a detailed drawing of our hand. This exercise, with the use of the flattened picture plane, teaches students to draw a three dimensional subject on a two dimensional surface. In the afternoon, a lecture on negative space followed by a drawing of a chair done strictly in negative space, teaches the right brain to look at the spaces between objects to render the drawing rather than drawing the lines of the object.</p>
<p><br/><b>--Day Three</b> starts with a lecture on the skill of sighting followed by a drawing of a room corner or, weather permitting a drawing outside. This learning is also called perspective and proportion. The skill of sighting is crucial to observation because every drawing is about the relationships between objects, angles and shapes.</p>
<p><br/><b>--Day Four</b> begins with a lecture on the proportions of the head in profile, followed by a drawing of a fellow student in profile. The key learning for this day is turning off the verbal left hemisphere and its desire to make symbolic associations. One student draws for 20 minutes while another poses and visa versa for the afternoon.</p>
<p><br/><b>--Day Five</b> starts with a discussion of light logic, also known as light and shadow. We learn a shading technique called cross hatching and the value scale of light to dark, which allows for the rendering of dramatic light and shadow within a drawing. We examine the proportions of the full faced head in preparation for the days drawing. Using grounded paper, all the perceptual skills we have learnt so far, and by looking for the shapes of the lights and shadow (negative space), students learn to use their eraser as a drawing tool together with the pencil.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What We Need</b></p>
<p>This 5 day workshop is $1,600 supplies included.</p>
<p>All funding over the goal amount will go to furthering artistic endeavors in the form of professional supplies vs. hobby store supplies and other classes.</p>
<p>Funding that does not reach the goal will likewise go to furthering artistic endeavors.</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Even if you can’t contribute it would be a great help if you could get the word out about what this campaign is trying to do. Just telling a friend or linking to it on facebook could be all we need to reach our goal.<span>  </span></p></div>","Hi, and thank you for taking the time to look at my campaign.

--Day Three starts with a lecture on the skill of sighting followed by a drawing of a room corner or, weather permitting a drawing outside. This learning is also called perspective and proportion. The skill of sighting is crucial to observation because every drawing is about the relationships between objects, angles and shapes.
--Day Four begins with a lecture on the proportions of the head in profile, followed by a drawing of a fellow student in profile. The key learning for this day is turning off the verbal left hemisphere and its desire to make symbolic associations. One student draws for 20 minutes while another poses and visa versa for the afternoon.
--Day Five starts with a discussion of light logic, also known as light and shadow. We learn a shading technique called cross hatching and the value scale of light to dark, which allows for the rendering of dramatic light and shadow within a drawing. We examine the proportions of the full faced head in preparation for the days drawing. Using grounded paper, all the perceptual skills we have learnt so far, and by looking for the shapes of the lights and shadow (negative space), students learn to use their eraser as a drawing tool together with the pencil.

What We Need
This 5 day workshop is $1,600 supplies included.
All funding over the goal amount will go to furthering artistic endeavors in the form of professional supplies vs. hobby store supplies and other classes.
Funding that does not reach the goal will likewise go to furthering artistic endeavors.

<p>For many of us, 2115 Taft felt like home.  It was a place of community, healing and love.  And so it's no surprise that many of us within the community at large have experienced a great deal of pain in regard to the loss of Taft.<br/><br/>But as someone who was actively and intimately involved in the Taft community through Make Art or Die, Love Machine, Iwo Jima, Gospel Brunch, and Ecclesia, it is my opinion that although it's hard to see the building go, the heart of what made Taft special was actually the <em>people</em>- you and me!  <br/><br/>I've heard some say that Elder doesn't feel like Taft.  Well, honestly it doesn't.  It feels like Elder.  There will never be another Taft- nowhere else will ever feel like Taft!  It was unique and special and we should count ourselves lucky to have experienced such a sacred space.  But what I don't want us to lose as a community at large is that although we will never replace 2115 Taft, it is within our grasp and calling to co-generate a new space- a space ripe for new memories, new healing and new life. </p>
<p>What I am suggesting is that we hold the keys for making Elder a uniquely special place of community, healing and love that we can all call home.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong><em>""Because to think that what made 2115 Taft special can in some way be torn down and lost forever is to never have known the Source of what made Taft so special in the first place.""</em></strong></p>
<h3><strong>THE PROJECT:</strong></h3>
<p>When I found out that Taft was being sold I felt drawn to pick up a camera and capture some of the sights and textures of Taft from my point of view.  I didn't know why- I just felt like I had to do it.</p>
<p>With the permission of the Taft community, I captured essential snapshots of our sacred space.  Many of the images depict feet and floors- partly to avoid exploiting faces/identities within the sacred space of gatherings, but also because feet and floors are a lot of what one sees while staring contemplatively during the conversations of healing, hope and love that took place there!</p>
<p>The imagery in this show reflects my personal perspective of Taft- the things that I took note of and that where special to me.  I hope that when others from the community see this show, they will be transported back to a time and place not so long ago, and would somehow be reminded and put in touch with the spirit of 2115 Taft that I believe is still very much alive and well, here and now.</p>
<p>My vision for this collection is to bring this spirit of Taft into the hallways of Elder.  To have this collection symbolically wrapped around the entire building, embracing our community at Elder.</p>
<p>The premise of this show attempts to capture snapshots of Taft's visual essence, transplanting them into the heart of Elder- hence the name of the collection is ""TRANSPLANT"".  This collection consists of twenty over-sized canvases, each a whopping 64""x36"".</p>
<p>I have been working with staff at Ecclesia to put this show together for several weeks.  When I pitched the unsolicited idea to have a show that honors and transplants the spirit of Taft into the halls of Elder, I was met with excitement, warmth and support from staff.  I feel very honored by their openness and welcoming spirit to remember Taft and the shared community experienced there.</p>

<h3>WHERE YOU COME IN:</h3>
<p>I cannot do this alone.  I need your help to make this happen.  When I submitted my proposal for this collection I told Carson that I would like to raise the funds for this collection through the community. </p>
<p>This is a huge undertaking from a production standpoint.  For those familiar with my REHUMANIZE collection, this show has 2.5x more pieces, and the individual canvases are 3x bigger!</p>
<p>In order to make this collection come to life, we need $2,900 to cover the hard costs associated with printing and stretching 20 canvases, creating wall graphics and producing print outs for the collection.  This number also reflects a <strong>$3,200 discount</strong> I have negotiated off of the total printing cost! <br/><br/>I really want to see this project come to life in our community and so I am fully prepared and planning to do my part for <strong>free</strong>- but I need to at least raise the base amount of $2,900 to make it happen.  Should we raise more than $2,900, I will be gratefully accepting any surplus as an honorarium going towards my personal involvement on this project.</p>
<h3>WHAT YOU GET:</h3>
<p>I have created some valuable perks for your donation to this project such as getting your own limited edition poster reprints from the show- or even a full size canvas reproduction of your favorite piece.  You can also sponsor the production of a specific piece or sponsor the costs of printing the wall graphics or show flyers.  You may also give without receiving a perk in return. </p>
<p>In the end whether you receive a perk or not, the bigger picture here is that <strong>I am inviting you to create and exhibit this art WITH me</strong>.  This is about us, not me.  And it is about all of us coming together to honor a shared Experience bigger than all of us.</p>
<h3>DEADLINE:</h3>
<p>We need to raise this money <strong>ASAP</strong> so I can put a deposit down for getting these canvases printed and hung in time for an opening party!  I have left this campaign open until July 10. </p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">It would be EXTREMELY helpful to get this funded by July 4th</span>.</strong></p>
<p>On a side note, I used to work for IndieGoGo (this website) as a crowd funding expert.  Statistically, these kind of projects have a greater chance of funding if we can hit 25% of our goal within the first few days. </p>

<p>""Breaking Point"" is a photographic project about
resilience, and our ability to push through adversity and hardship. The term
“Breaking Point” is used in breath-hold diving and refers to the moment a
person submits to their overwhelming urge to take a breath. </p>For this ongoing project I will photograph people holding
their breath under water and then coming up for air at their breaking point. Capturing this moment
results in an intimate and emotive transaction between the subject, artist and
viewer.  <p></p>
<p>The first image in this series, of my great friend Emma
Walsh,  won the Royal Hibernian Academy's (Dublin, Ireland) Photography Prize
2011 and was critically acclaimed in the Irish Times and Sunday Times and was also
published in Manifest Gallery's (USA) International Photography Annual.  In 2013 this image will also be shown in the Royal Ulster
 Academy's (Belfast) annual show and
Irish Museum of Contemporary Art's ""New Living Artists"" show along with new pieces in this series.  </p>

<p>Imagine being in your 20’s, freelancing, practically unemployed, bored and depressed. That was the state I was in some time ago. Then, my Grandmother handed me a special gift. My Great-Great Aunt Edna’s sewing box.</p>
<p>I looked through the old box and discovered a gift no one could have bought for me. The gift had been building up since the 1930’s from a woman in my family who passed at the age of 97 years old. Inside were my Aunt’s steel crochet hooks, patterns dated back to the 1940’s, spools of thread, carpet hooks, tapestry needles, knitting needles, pieces of lace, including one that was still unfinished attached to her tatting shuttle.</p>
<p>After looking through this treasure trove of items, I found out more about my Aunt's passion for creating. A light went on in my head and I set out to create my own works that would be given away as gifts. The depression I was going through began to lift and I had something to look forward to.</p>
<p>After years of crafting as a hobby, I have set out to create a series of books for the beginner crafter - or for the crafter who wants a refresher course. I want these books to be available for free. Anyone who feels like paying for them can, but payment is not required. My goal is to reach people who were in the state I was in and give them the ability to wake up each day looking forward to something. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What do I need?</h3>
<p>Most of the supplies for the projects are already in my home in my ever-growing craft storage area. I do need a better camera so I can not only take pictures for step-by-step tutorials but so that I can also create videos to go with each book. </p>
<p>There are some minor costs associated with publishing the books. The largest will be to get some graphics for the covers created. They will be primarily available on Kindle and similar platforms, but I need a way to get these books in print on an as-needed basis. Why? Because I want anyone who needs these books to have them! </p>
<h3>But Why?</h3>
<p>This series is truly a labor of love. I have no idea if any of the published books will make money. That's not why I'm doing this. I'm doing this to reach out to people who are in the same situation I was in. I am also doing this to prove some ""old fashioned"" crafts aren't as dated as you think. Hey, I'm only 30! I can't possibly do anything ""old"" yet.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Can't I Get This For Free?</h3>
<p>Yes, but there's a problem with that. Let's say you want to learn how to crochet. You find one video that teaches you the basics, then you have to find more videos that are easy to understand and good quality. Those videos will end up in a playlist or a bookmark for reference. Hooray! You learned how! </p>
<p>Now, it's time to find your first project. Oh, holy cow. Google has thousands and thousands of results for beginners, but which one is right? Is it really easy? Only one way to find out! What if the project you tried isn't as easy as you hoped? You wasted time and supplies. Plus, you're bummed out. I know this because it's happened to me with certain crafts. </p>
<p>The Harps and Crafts series is meant to get rid of the searching. Everything is in one place. Including all of the beginner's information, the basics you need to get started and some projects I designed that are tailored to work with beginners. Each thing has a step-by-step picture tutorial and will have videos to accompany it. </p>
<p>(Plus, you won't have to pay for the book if you don't want to. So it's free anyway!)</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>So You Can't Donate</h3>
<p>Well bummer. That's OK. Talk about it on your Twitter, Facebook or blog. Heck, email me and talk to me. Then post that on your blog! Any noise I get will make me love you that much more. </p>
<p>Being able to do this made a huge change in my life. I found myself in a better place mentally and physically. Creating these books is a gift I want to offer to anyone in the state I was in. </p>
<p>I'll do these books even if the campaign doesn't reach it's goal. But, donating to this campaign will help me get the books completed faster which means I will reach more people in less time. </p>

These islands (atolls) are also claimed by Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Indonesia, and Malaysia. This bold overlapping exercise of powers with territorial map on an international scale made UuDam Tran Nguyen rethink the concept of measuring. He finds that exciting when the real distances of things being measured is not necessarily reflected scientifically or lawfully especially when it is influenced by desires, beliefs &amp; national needs. He thinks about what one did when one was a child. One would measure things around them with their outstretched fingers: the first act of almost pure measuring. That’s when he made the first sculpture in the first phase of Time Boomerang. He casted his hand, fingers fully outstretched in his childhood measuring gesture, in metal. When it was completed, he cut out the five fingertips, and moved them away from the hand, symbolically extending his ability to measure (or mark new territories). These five places could be 5 corners of a museum, a university campus, a country, a continent, 5 continents of the Earth, 5 places in a Galaxy, or 5 Galaxies and so on.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565337920/kiaqksdkcwyp766r3pou.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Phase #1: Cast hand and five fingertips ready for five continents</p><p> </p><p><strong>► INTRODUCTION TO TIME BOOMERANG, AMERICA PERFORMANCE</strong></p><p>Over a period of several years, UuDam will place the 5 fingertips in the oceans of five different continents. </p><p>Until this moment, UuDam has successfully launched 2 of the 5 bronze fingertips into the waters of Europe and Australia continents as part of Phase #2 . By measuring the world, the artist wishes to elevate a regional conflict onto a vast time and space where mediated dialogues can take place without impassioned fistfights based on heated patriotism. The Time Boomerang is an on-going project made up of 8 phases. UuDam is pleased to present Phase #1, two parts of Phase #2, Phase #3 and Phase #4 for the first time in Orange County Museum of Art. </p><p>This August, UuDam Tran Nguyen would like to complete the third part of Phase #2,  bring his third bronze fingertip to America.

He would like to put himself in the shoes of earlier travelers (pre airplane era) to experience the vast time, space they were in. 2. He wishes to feel the energy that moves huge amount of world commerce in the expansive blue of the Pacific Ocean. 3. Perhaps he can feel the migrant story traveling to a new land from a perspective of an ocean traveler. Instead of jet-lag, he will probably experience boat-lag when reaching America.The type of cargo ship artist UuDam will take to come to Los Angeles (a 30-day trip)► WHAT WILL YOUR CONTRIBUTION SUPPORT?The cost of this ambitious Pacific Ocean crossing and performances is above and beyond the UuDam Studio and OCMA budgeted funds. After the first round of crowdfunding asking for $19,000 USD, UuDam studio has raised $7,000 USD various ways. Then it ran out of time.This second Indiegogo campaign is the catalyst to rally additional support needed to pay for the UuDam and his  assistant's 6 weeks journey on a cargo ship and launching the third fingertip into California ocean. By donating to this campaign, you will help fund their travel costs & equipment and provide modest housing during the 4-week long ocean travel & 2-week performance in California and airfare back to Việt Nam. Your support will also help provide honorariums for project collaborators, videographer, photographer, hotel and car rental, insurance, accommodations as well as video post-production, etc. The goal is to raise 12,000 USD more to cover that cost.  Your gift will radically enhance the Time Boomerang exhibition project at OCMA by making it into reality in American continent.

These islands (atolls) are also claimed by Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Indonesia, and Malaysia. This bold overlapping exercise of powers with territorial map on an international scale made UuDam Tran Nguyen rethink the concept of measuring. He finds that exciting when the real distances of things being measured is not necessarily reflected scientifically or lawfully especially when it is influenced by desires, beliefs & national needs. He thinks about what one did when one was a child. One would measure things around them with their outstretched fingers: the first act of almost pure measuring. That’s when he made the first sculpture in the first phase of Time Boomerang. He casted his hand, fingers fully outstretched in his childhood measuring gesture, in metal. When it was completed, he cut out the five fingertips, and moved them away from the hand, symbolically extending his ability to measure (or mark new territories). These five places could be 5 corners of a museum, a university campus, a country, a continent, 5 continents of the Earth, 5 places in a Galaxy, or 5 Galaxies and so on.Phase #1: Cast hand and five fingertips ready for five continents ► INTRODUCTION TO TIME BOOMERANG, AMERICA PERFORMANCEOver a period of several years, UuDam will place the 5 fingertips in the oceans of five different continents. Until this moment, UuDam has successfully launched 2 of the 5 bronze fingertips into the waters of Europe and Australia continents as part of Phase #2 . By measuring the world, the artist wishes to elevate a regional conflict onto a vast time and space where mediated dialogues can take place without impassioned fistfights based on heated patriotism. The Time Boomerang is an on-going project made up of 8 phases. UuDam is pleased to present Phase #1, two parts of Phase #2, Phase #3 and Phase #4 for the first time in Orange County Museum of Art. This August, UuDam Tran Nguyen would like to complete the third part of Phase #2,  bring his third bronze fingertip to America. California will be the chosen destination.PHASE #2: The New Conqueror with a Good Passport. Part 3 of 5: America Performance      Phase #2: 30 days crossing the Pacific Ocean trip for the America performance - July-AugustIn July and August 2019, in conjunction with his exhibition currently on view at the Orange County Museum of Art,  the acclaimed Vietnamese artist UuDam Tran Nguyen will carry out his historic symbol-laden trip crossing the Pacific Ocean on a cargo ship. After that 30-day voyage, he will reach Los Angeles port. UuDam then will perform the dropping the third bronze fingertip into the California Pacific Ocean. Those two activities will complete Part 3 of Phase #2 of this 8-Phased Time Boomerang project.As the chief critic of OC WEEKLY Dave Barton wrote “Starting with the idea that a child uses his hand to measure things—and the image of a land grab is the perfect childish symbol for an empire—the artist has cast his hand, then cut of the tips of all five fingertips. Those sculpted fingertips will be dropped into bodies of water bordering five of the continents, as a performative way to reclaim territory. It’s essentially a nonsense gesture, but just as with many useless things signifying hope, he persists in doing it anyway.”    Phase #2: Europe Performance (picture by Polly Yassin)The crossing of the Pacific Ocean and the America performance later in California are continuing parts of the US debut of Time Boomerang at the Orange County Museum of Art from April 7, 2019 — Sept 1, 2019. This is a very special occasion to bring the TIME BOOMERANG's third bronze fingertip to the USA shore. Please join us in bringing this timely message of hope to California, a place that has prided itself on independent thinking, demographic diversity and home of the biggest Vietnamese-American community oversea that closely connected to the conflicts in the South China Sea, where this project got inspired from in the first place.     Phase #1, #2, #4 of Time Boomerang installation at National Art Center Tokyo, in the         SunShower exhibition ► AN OVERVIEW OF TIME BOOMERANGTIME BOOMERANG CONSISTS OF 8 PHASES:PHASE #1: The Real Distances of Things Being Measured Phase #1: Gilded bronze hand inside an engraved plexiglass box (picture by UuDam Studio)PHASE #2: The New Conqueror with a Good Passport, 5 parts     - Part 1: EUROPE (completed)On the 22nd of September 2015, UuDam traveled from Viet Nam to Sweden to launch the first of the five fingertips into the Gulf of Bothnia. The European performance is part of the TIME BOOMERANG Phase #2. During that time, Phase #1 was on display in the Miền Méo Miệng exhibition at Bildmuseet Museum.  Phase #2: Europe Performance (picture by Polly Yassin)- Part 2: AUSTRALIA (completed)On the 29th of November 2015, after two cancellations due to bad weather, the second bronze fingertip was launched into the Moreton Bay in Brisbane, Australia. UuDam was part of the 8th Asia Pacific Triennial while carrying out his second performance of the TIME BOOMERANG Phase #2. Phase #2: Australia Performance (picture by Chloë Callistemon)    - Part 3: AMERICA Performance (to be performed in August, 2019. This is where your funding is going to support).     - Part 4: AFRICA (to be announced)    - Part 5: ANTARCTICA (to be announced)PHASE #3: Digital Body Print - commissioned by OCMA By CAT scanning his body and extracting the bone part into digital files with his initial UDN carved all over. UuDam's skeleton could be printed in 3D on demand. This mimics the old practice of many war where one need to find the reason to occupy new territory. Once the bone is ready, the artist can bury them on any territory where he wants to possess.   Phase #3: Digital Body PrintPHASE #4: Cartography 101: Creating the Next Freaking World OrderBe our guest at the weekly breaking maps performance at OCMA.After ""conquering"" all five continents with his bronze fingertips, we have the power to turn it up side down and break it up.

Who I am?
I'm a 19 year old student living in the UK, born with the dream of travelling the world, a passion for drawing, creating, expressing unique ideas and learning the wicked ways of life. I study Computer Visualisation and Animation and I am striving to reach the top of this industry and work on the next block buster movies.

To stand out as an artist, I want to study my craft in the traditional way. I've been studying anatomy, its construction, bones and their functionality on my own for a few good years now. Travelling to Florence though, studying the sculptures in real life and embracing the creative atmosphere, is what makes a whole world of a difference.

What's the plan?

Once I get there, I plan on all of my time studying and drawing in Florence's ""Top 10 Museums"" including Uffizi Gallery and the Academia and join the ""Creative People in Florence"" community. The main activity will be studying a few good books I will take with me (Paul Richer, George Bridgman, Andrew Loomis and others) along with real life sculpture and life drawing sessions.

<p> Thank you to everyone who assisted in making this happen! Thank you Takach Press!! Thank you Hannah March Sanders and Blake Sanders, we did it!!!!!  Thank You to all the Artists and contributors!!  Press release from UPRRP coming soon </p>
<div>
<h3>Let's Leave A Press in Puerto Rico!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</h3>
<p>Members of the Southern Graphics Conference International have launched a crowdfunding campaign to purchase a press for the University of Puerto Rico Rio Piedras (UPRRP) printshop, led by Professor Martin Garcia-Rivera. The Printmaking Conference in San Juan, April 1-4, 2020, is the perfect opportunity to learn of the rich printmaking history in Puerto Rico and to give back to our hosts, who have faced many challenges in recent years.</p>
<p>Martin Garcia- Rivera has been teaching at UPRRP since 1993 and engages with the community in many projects. Following Hurricane Maria, his school lost one third of its student body, and many facilities were destroyed. The printmaking area will not have funding to purchase a new press in any foreseeable future.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get!</h3>
<p>We need to raise an incredible amount to purchase a press and transport that heavy machine to San Juan! We will be posting Print Perks on social media and will update it weekly!!!</p>
<ul>
<li>Ideally, we would like to raise $15,000 to purchase a new press. However, the amount raised will determine the size of the press we are able to leave! </li>
<li>We have Print Perks!! Artists and publishers have provided amazing Print Packs from Printers of prominence and publishers too!</li>
<li>We have Print Packs from faculty and alum from historic programs as well as other unique perks!! </li>
<li>We have Skateboard Press by the FAU Print Club and T-shirt Print Packs from Drive By Press!</li>
<li>If we do not reach the goal for a press of the size that would benefit the program, the funds will be used for shop items of need at UPRRP such as brayers, Ink, paper, copper plates, etc.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This campaign will benefit the printmakers of tomorrow in San Juan and enable Professor Martin Garcia-Rivera and UPRRP to continue the tradition of printmaking at that program where funding for a new press is non-existent. </p>
<ul>
<li>The devastation caused by Hurricane Maria is a great challenge, to both the government and private sector. The arts are often the last and least funded.</li>
<li>Printmakers coming together for a cause will hopefully set a precedent for us to continue to assist printmakers and places in need.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3></div>
<p>The biggest challenge is getting the press there. The more we raise, the bigger the press, but also the higher the transportation expense.</p>
<ul>
<li>We will hit a shipping weight threshold where press size will not matter. So, once we've raised the funds for a new press we must also calculate shipping.</li>
<li>We have not yet been contacted by any press manufacturers and are hoping to partner with press suppliers!</li>

<p>Paul is a groovy little dude and the strongest and most musically gifted of any Beetle. Paul started out as a silly sketch in my journal. I liked him so much I made him a pin. I thought it would be a neat challenge to make a figure that retained a graphic look. His pincers are poseable and give him the ability to change expression! He stands at 5 inches tall.</p>

<p>We started Et Alia to create a space for up-and-coming internationals in the arts to share their worldview with others and to bring people together from all cultures, communities, and ways of life. We like to say that while we may speak different languages, art speaks to everyone in a language they can understand. We hope to communicate the beautiful language of art to our audiences in 2020 and beyond.</p>
<p>We’ve mounted three original shows in New York City so far, and hope to bring many more to the stage this year. </p>
<p>Your contributions will help fund our 2020 season and give a voice and a stage to American foreigners, immigrants, and other minorities through our theater company.</p>

<p>Because of our lack of resources, we had to use our own props and costumes, we could not get ideal rehearsal space, we had a limited team of collaborators and we were only able to do a single performance of each.

We are Giorgia Valenti, Maria Müller, Ana Moioli and Isabella Uzcátegui – four international, ambitious, and aspiring female theater professionals who are passionate about elevating minority voices on stage in America. 
Our next show is coming up at The Tank on Feb 22nd, 24th and 25th! Please be there. Here is the ticket link:

We started Et Alia to create a space for up-and-coming internationals in the arts to share their worldview with others and to bring people together from all cultures, communities, and ways of life. We like to say that while we may speak different languages, art speaks to everyone in a language they can understand. We hope to communicate the beautiful language of art to our audiences in 2020 and beyond.
We’ve mounted three original shows in New York City so far, and hope to bring many more to the stage this year. 
Your contributions will help fund our 2020 season and give a voice and a stage to American foreigners, immigrants, and other minorities through our theater company.

The Impact
The stories we want to show our audience come from the countries we have lived in and the experiences we share of feeling foreign in an unknown land. We have a lot to say, and we want to use our voices to explore viewpoints that the New York audience may not have been exposed to yet. 
In the Fall, we had two successful events. One was Running in Place at Dixon Place, premiering the work of the Indian playwright Hasnain Shaikh and exploring the themes of love and loss. The second was the first staged reading of Maria Müller's play On How To Be A Monster, directed by Patricia Marjorie, which involved many new artists from very diverse backgrounds. We also opened the floor for other artists in the audience to share their own work and look for collaborators in an open-mic following the reading. We want to connect people and create a powerful creative community!
Because of our lack of resources, we had to use our own props and costumes, we could not get ideal rehearsal space, we had a limited team of collaborators and we were only able to do a single performance of each. If we had the resources to reach a larger audience and explore our creativities with no financial restrictions, we would make a much stronger impact on the NYC art scene than we already have been making.
 

Risks & Challenges
Putting up a show is not an easy task. Making art takes time and money. It also takes passion, network, patience, teamwork, and hustle.

<p style=""margin-top: 0mm; margin-bottom: 5mm;"">
  Artists work full time at a profession. They hold down jobs. They derive little from their vocation, their passion for art.
  And while interest in art is near universal, owning an original work remains an aspiration. Beyond ordinary reach.
 </p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0mm; margin-bottom: 5mm;"">
<b>How to change things?</b> How to increase the remuneration of artists? How to increase the ownership of art? 
  By building a community. By creating a market in  affordable  art.

<p style=""margin-top: 0mm; margin-bottom: 5mm;"">
  Artworld must become self funding. Its activities: community development, infrastructure support, planning &amp; strategy,

  the number of its artists and the diversity of its artworks, grows. The funds will be used:

<li style=""margin-top: 0mm; margin-right: 5mm; margin-bottom: 5mm; margin-left: 0mm;"">
   To categorise artists as community, emerging, galleried and established; and artworks by style, by subject and price.

  <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=242370892595110&amp;set=vb.119422701556597&amp;type=2&amp;theater"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""Artworld Documents"" title=""Artists' Video"">video</a> we've made for you: it’s a variation on the buyer’s

  Artworld perks are incremental, that is by selecting a perk of a given value, you will also receive all the less expensive perks.
  Should the original (competition) prints be over-subscribed, a choice of two digital prints will be substituted. 
 </p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0mm; margin-bottom: 5mm;"">
  Artworld offers a waiver of in-app charges as our first two ""perks"" for your contribution. Of these the second is the most valuable, 
  and represents an open ended thank you for helping us build what the community will need. 
 </p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0mm; margin-bottom: 5mm;"">
  For our more generous contributors we offer something tangible: a beautifully produced limited-edition print. Eight artists, all contributors to Artworld, have most generously agreed to the use of their original work for the production of a limited edition of digital or glicée prints. The edition is strictly limited to contributors 
  to Artworld's crowd-funding campaign, and each print is accompanied by a certificate of authenticity signed by the artist. The print size is some 20 - 25cm. To choose a print, and to review the details of the digital edition, refer to our

 </p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0mm; margin-bottom: 5mm;"">
<b>Finally for our most generous contributors we offer something unique</b>. And because Artworld is all about the artists, I thought to include them 
   even at this early stage. It would be perfect to commission an <i>original</i>, limited edition of signed and numbered prints. 
   The artist will be decided by an 
   <a href=""http://business.negativeentropy.net/Artworld/Email/Indiegogo/Artworld%20Competition.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""Artworld Documents"" title=""Competition Page"">Open Competition</a>,
   currently running, and publicised on our Facebook page. 
   Call to artists! We invite entries for a wood-cut, etching, engraving, intaglio or relief suitable for printing on 25cm - 30cm paper, but otherwise unrestricted in technique or subject.
   The competition will be judged by a panel of four judges, chosen internationally, all experts in the production of original prints. The cash prize is <b>€1,500</b> 
   (roughly <b>$2,000</b>) for which the artist will produce a limited edition of 50 prints. There will be an opportunity
   to see selected ""candidate"" works as they are submitted. <b>Our most generous contributor will receive the very first, the <i>original</i>, signed print</b>.
 </p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0mm; margin-bottom: 5mm;"">
  We particularly want the continued support and participation of our most generous  givers. We offer editorial and advisory roles that will help shape the project,
  help it grow. You don't have to take a larger part, but we warmly invite you to do so. These ""perks"" are limited in number, 
  but they are key to the project's success. Help us with a more than financial generosity. Help us guide the community to a global future. 
  And all this for the benefit of artists and their art.

</div></div>","Why support Artworld?

  Artists work full time at a profession. They hold down jobs. They derive little from their vocation, their passion for art.
  And while interest in art is near universal, owning an original work remains an aspiration. Beyond ordinary reach.
 

How to change things? How to increase the remuneration of artists? How to increase the ownership of art? 
  By building a community. By creating a market in  affordable  art.
 

  My name is Keith McFarlane 
  and I’m the owner of Negative Entropy BV, a one-man business based in Amsterdam
  and specialising in the arts. 
  Having spent years in industry, and much of my life devoted to the sciences, 
  I find my passion for the arts rekindled.
 

  For the last eighteen months I been talking to artists, formulating ideas, reaching out to institutions, thinking & planning,
   designing & developing software, setting up a virtual community, corresponding with artists, artists from across the world.
   This I have done without payment. Neither have I sought commercial backing. Artworld was conceived as a community project, 
   strictly 
   pro bono
    for the artists, and
   at cost 
   to the community as a whole.
 

  The project funding will be raised by crowd-funding, from app-users, and from an annual subscription from participating galleries
  and commercial institutions. The artists will always pay nothing, as will schools and public exhibitions. App-users will download
  Artworld 
  for free, in line with the general ""best practice” on the App Store and to encourage participation. That means using in-app purchases
  to unlock ""premium"" features most useful to serious buyers and collectors.
 





What is Artworld?

  Artworld is a community of artists, galleries, art-lovers, art-buyers and collectors. 
  We're on Facebook 
 and the App Store. 
 We are 5,000: from whom around 500 are artists registered with, and contributing to the Artworld app.
 

  The key to our project is the 
  Artworld
  app. 
  Artworld combines a catalogue of local art with the contacts and prices of a marketplace. Artworld uses geolocation
  to present mobile-users with work from local artists. Buyers can set up viewing, arrange a visit or make an offer. All this 
  by email or telephone from within the app itself. We have some exceptional work, well worth your attention. There is, I think,
  something for everyone with an interest in the arts. Artworld presents our artists' work beautifully. 
  Don't take my word for it: take a look at our 
  Reviews! 
 

  The community's Facebook page 
  combines literary, editorial and critical work, community news and discussion. 
  The page is richly illustrated with community art. (Also see our newly created crowd-funding
   page.)
 





What do we need?

  Artworld must become self funding. Its activities: community development, infrastructure support, planning & strategy,
  development and innovation, ever-greening, listening, marketing, editing, curating and organising all require money and time. 
  And in such quantity that my resources are already stretched!
 

I am asking for funds to support the continuing growth and development of the 
  Artworld
  app. This work is needed in order to refine and to manage the buyer's experience as the Artworld community, 
  the number of its artists and the diversity of its artworks, grows. The funds will be used:
 


   To help buyers to find work that is matched to their tastes and pocket book. It will also be local. 
   And how much more interesting and focused to be able to contact and to visit the artist him or herself?
  

   To categorise artists as community, emerging, galleried and established; and artworks by style, by subject and price.
  

   To develop an in-app purchase system offering a much improved experience for art buyers and collectors. 
  


  For a more detailed explanation and a breakdown of costs, refer to the attached 
  Work to be Funded.
  Should you have questions 
  or need specific clarification. please contact me 
  direct.
 





What do you get?

We offer a unique chance to contribute to, to take part in and to influence the development of our online community. 
  We welcome your participation and invite you to take part. If you’re an artist yourself then take a look at the
  video we've made for you: it’s a variation on the buyer’s
  video, but it’s from the artist's point of view.
  Artworld perks are incremental, that is by selecting a perk of a given value, you will also receive all the less expensive perks.
  Should the original (competition) prints be over-subscribed, a choice of two digital prints will be substituted. 
 

  Artworld offers a waiver of in-app charges as our first two ""perks"" for your contribution. Of these the second is the most valuable, 
  and represents an open ended thank you for helping us build what the community will need. 
 

  For our more generous contributors we offer something tangible: a beautifully produced limited-edition print. Eight artists, all contributors to Artworld, have most generously agreed to the use of their original work for the production of a limited edition of digital or glicée prints. The edition is strictly limited to contributors 
  to Artworld's crowd-funding campaign, and each print is accompanied by a certificate of authenticity signed by the artist. The print size is some 20 - 25cm. To choose a print, and to review the details of the digital edition, refer to our 
  Prospectus.
 

Finally for our most generous contributors we offer something unique. And because Artworld is all about the artists, I thought to include them 
   even at this early stage. It would be perfect to commission an original, limited edition of signed and numbered prints. 
   The artist will be decided by an 
   Open Competition,
   currently running, and publicised on our Facebook page. 
   Call to artists! We invite entries for a wood-cut, etching, engraving, intaglio or relief suitable for printing on 25cm - 30cm paper, but otherwise unrestricted in technique or subject.
   The competition will be judged by a panel of four judges, chosen internationally, all experts in the production of original prints. The cash prize is €1,500 
   (roughly $2,000) for which the artist will produce a limited edition of 50 prints. There will be an opportunity
   to see selected ""candidate"" works as they are submitted. Our most generous contributor will receive the very first, the original, signed print.
 

  We particularly want the continued support and participation of our most generous  givers. We offer editorial and advisory roles that will help shape the project,
  help it grow. You don't have to take a larger part, but we warmly invite you to do so. These ""perks"" are limited in number, 
  but they are key to the project's success. Help us with a more than financial generosity. Help us guide the community to a global future. 
  And all this for the benefit of artists and their art.
 





How does this help Artists?

  Artworld is not revolutionary, but it has the potential greatly to expand the ownership of contemporary art, and to increase the number of artists
  that can find a reward, even make a living from their art. It will do so by doing just four things superbly well.
 


Help Community Artists. Make community art far more visible. Direct mobile buyers to local artists. Help create an income for emerging artists
   not yet represented and largely unknown.
  

Help Established Artists. Make known locally artists both emerging and established more visible to visiting art-lovers. 
   Draw in contacts from ""armchair travellers“, galleries and institutions worldwide.
  

Help Local Galleries. Help promote local galleries and galleries with a specialist portfolio artists far more visible to visiting art-lovers. 
   Draw in contacts from ""armchair travellers“ worldwide.
  

Put the Artworks Centre-Stage. It's the ability to leaf through a catalogue of the work of local artists
   that really brings  Artworld  to life. Artworld presents art beautifully.
   And if an art-lover sees something he likes, the artist or gallery is just one tap away!
  






Other ways you can Help

  If you can’t contribute money, we would be delighted if you could give us your time. Artworld needs your support in attracting artists, gallerists, art-lovers,
  art-buyers and collectors. There are at least a four of roles that are  essential  to the project. And all of them require a commitment
 to helping the arts' community by helping Artworld grow.

<br/>My name is Jon Shannon Rogers and I make paintings and drawings. I received a BFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and an MFA from the New York Studio School. Throughout I have had a passion for working from direct observation with an emphasis on color. My current process is working directly from a subject for extended periods of time and then translating those works into large studio abstractions. Over the last few years since getting my MFA I have painted and taught as an Adjunct Professor living in Little Rock, Arkansas. This July I moved to Oakland, CA to join the Firehouse Art Collective. <br/><br/><p>         <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/762054/files/20140802171832-IMG_1858.JPG?1407025112"" src="""" style=""width: 233.449px; height: 186px;""/>                       <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/762055/files/20140802172103-best_car_wash_on_markham.jpg?1407025263"" src="""" style=""width: 233.13px; height: 185px;""/></p>

<p>One of six nominations by The New York Studio School I was selected as Artist in Residency for the month of September at the Dumfries House in East Ayershire Scotland. The residency is sponsored by the Prince's Drawing School, a London based school devoted to the practice of drawing and one of 18 charitable organizations funded by His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales. The New York Studio School was invited to make nominations with four other American institutions- The Art Students League of New York, The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, The New York Academy, and the Yale University School of Art. </p>

<p>My goal for this campaign<b> </b>is to raise $2000 for use on supplies and travel. The residency comes with a generous $2000 stipend and I have saved $1500 for my own use during this time. But after buying plane tickets, paying rent while I am gone, and factoring in money for food and living expenses, my budget for supplies and travel will be a little tight. This campaign will alleviate the stress of financial strain and allow for me to make the most of this incredible opportunity. <br/></p>
<p><b>Supplies</b>- I have enough saved to buy basic supplies like good paper, charcoal, ink, and even a little watercolor, as well as tape and fixative and the like. This campaign will allow me to further beef up my artistic arsenal with a roll of large high quality paper and more charcoal and fixative for large drawings, like this one:</p>

<p><b>Travel:</b> While studying in Italy for six weeks in 2007 at the International School of Drawing, Painting, and Sculpture, we took weekend trips from our perch on Montecastello di Vibio to see works by the Italian Masters in places like Bologna, Arezzo, and Assissi. I would like to recreate something like this while in Scotland for at least two of the weekends. I have tentatively planned to Travel to London for a weekend to visit the National Gallery and other collections, as well as a trip into Northern Scotland to see more of the country. I will be looking for other exciting opportunities before and during the trip. If you have ideas please let me know! <br/></p>
<p>I also have dreams of post-residency travel. The most expensive part about overseas travel is getting to the region. While planning a two week trip to India and Thailand in 2012, I was able to extend my travels another four weeks to include Cambodia, Laos, and Northern Thailand by selling a large drawing. The money raised was less than the original ticket cost and enabled me to extend the trip by 200%! Europe is a little more pricey, but I think if I budget well and meet my campaign goal (with your help) I can travel for another two weeks before returning to the US to install an exhibition in November.</p>

<p><span></span>This will be my first Artist in Residency experience and I want to make the most of it.

</div></div>","Welcome (serious artist face)
My name is Jon Shannon Rogers and I make paintings and drawings. I received a BFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and an MFA from the New York Studio School. Throughout I have had a passion for working from direct observation with an emphasis on color. My current process is working directly from a subject for extended periods of time and then translating those works into large studio abstractions. Over the last few years since getting my MFA I have painted and taught as an Adjunct Professor living in Little Rock, Arkansas. This July I moved to Oakland, CA to join the Firehouse Art Collective.                                 
         Best Car Wash                                                      Car Wash, Fair Park & Markham
         Oil on Canvas                                                         Oil on Canvas       
         48 x 60                                                                    16 x 20                              

One of six nominations by The New York Studio School I was selected as Artist in Residency for the month of September at the Dumfries House in East Ayershire Scotland. The residency is sponsored by the Prince's Drawing School, a London based school devoted to the practice of drawing and one of 18 charitable organizations funded by His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales. The New York Studio School was invited to make nominations with four other American institutions- The Art Students League of New York, The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, The New York Academy, and the Yale University School of Art. 



                               
""Dumfries House is set in 2,000 acres of land in East Ayrshire, Scotland and was       built between 1754 and 1759 for the 5th Earl of Dumfries. It has been described as an 18th century time-capsule due to the fact that the principal rooms and their contents have remained virtually unchanged for 250 years.""
I will be sharing the residency with three UK artists, and the residency is providing housing as well as private studio space. We will also have access to the collection of art and craft housed on the estate for the National Gallery of Scotland.

                        
                                                                  (oooh, fancy)

                      Funding Goal: 2000 Buckaroos
My goal for this campaign is to raise $2000 for use on supplies and travel. The residency comes with a generous $2000 stipend and I have saved $1500 for my own use during this time. But after buying plane tickets, paying rent while I am gone, and factoring in money for food and living expenses, my budget for supplies and travel will be a little tight. This campaign will alleviate the stress of financial strain and allow for me to make the most of this incredible opportunity. 
Supplies- I have enough saved to buy basic supplies like good paper, charcoal, ink, and even a little watercolor, as well as tape and fixative and the like. This campaign will allow me to further beef up my artistic arsenal with a roll of large high quality paper and more charcoal and fixative for large drawings, like this one:

                                                    Titian's Bacchus and Ariadne                                                                                                                                    

                          Charcoal on Paper                                                                                                                                                                       

                          76 x 82                         As well as bring some oil paints, canvas and stretchers, plus a full palette of watercolors and good watercolor paper to do on-site painting like this one:

                          
                          Baphuon, Angkor Wat, Cambodia         
                          Watercolor on Paper         
                          12 x 16
Travel: While studying in Italy for six weeks in 2007 at the International School of Drawing, Painting, and Sculpture, we took weekend trips from our perch on Montecastello di Vibio to see works by the Italian Masters in places like Bologna, Arezzo, and Assissi. I would like to recreate something like this while in Scotland for at least two of the weekends. I have tentatively planned to Travel to London for a weekend to visit the National Gallery and other collections, as well as a trip into Northern Scotland to see more of the country. I will be looking for other exciting opportunities before and during the trip. If you have ideas please let me know! 
I also have dreams of post-residency travel. The most expensive part about overseas travel is getting to the region. While planning a two week trip to India and Thailand in 2012, I was able to extend my travels another four weeks to include Cambodia, Laos, and Northern Thailand by selling a large drawing. The money raised was less than the original ticket cost and enabled me to extend the trip by 200%! Europe is a little more pricey, but I think if I budget well and meet my campaign goal (with your help) I can travel for another two weeks before returning to the US to install an exhibition in November.
                             
RewardsIn return for your generosity I am offering several perks in conjunction with the warm, fuzzy feeling helping an aspiring professional accomplish their dreams often gives: $30 - 1 Ticket to the Opening of my forthcoming Exhibition at the Thea Foundation in North Little Rock on November 7th, 2014.

                              Challenges
This will be my first Artist in Residency experience and I want to make the most of it. While I was studying in Italy in 2007, my first experience working abroad, my budget was pretty tight. When the art supply company that I bought materials from had an unexpected delay completing my shipment, I was left with few choices for local art supply solutions as well as diminished funding. The stress and difficulty of working within too limited a means is something I would like to be absent from my upcoming residency. With your help I can focus on the intent of the residency and make my work!
I have experience traveling overseas and have grown adept at saving money and traveling smartly. You can be sure that after traveling in Italy, Spain, France, India, Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos, every dollar of your donations will be maximized toward the goals of art-making and art-related travel adventures.
Like everyone, I have monthly bills to pay. The big obstacles, like rent and student loan debts make budgeting very necessary for this trip. I am currently working two jobs in the East Bay about six to seven days a week. I wait tables as well as do some work with an art handling company, to be sure that my current savings aren't diminished before the trip. Without working for the month of September, I will probably have to keep up this rigorous work schedule upon return to the US. This would stifle the peak production level I will be coming out of the residency with. A successful campaign will, in conjunction with providing supplies and the ability to travel, also cushion my return financially to allow me to keep making work once I'm home again. 

If you are not able to donate, thats ok! You can still help by getting out the word. Please tell as many people as you can and be sure to use the Indie Go Go share tools embedded in the website.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Mateca Productions was founded in 1987 by Teresa Caro Ottens. Since then, the company has presented, organized and curated multiple art and music events, such as Mercedes Sosa, Mayra Caridad Valdés, NG La Banda and Adrián Iaies, etc. Always committed to promote the works of Canadian and International artists. As part of the portfolio, Mateca Productions has also been the consultant to some Canadian companies working with Latin America in the fields of Culture, Tourism &amp; Aviation. Mateca has a knack for coordinating challenging projects, being the right hand for some Latin American Airlines over the years, finding different venues to promote sales, emphasizing cultural events, thus creating a weave of cross promotions. She is currently working, with her own team, in the production of a new form of art festival to promote Latin American culture. Additional, Mateca offers event planning services covering all the production aspects, advertising, design, catering and performances.</p>
<h3><strong>MISSION</strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Mateca Productions Inc. is committed to support music,
performance and visual arts. It has always been our aim to build strong
cultural bridges that support the diversity of our society, transforming and impacting our audiences through knowledge and respect of each other’s culture.
Artists have a catalytic effect, they are the hidden persuaders and those who reach the masses, foreseeing issues with more clarity. Their power is infinite.
Art gives purpose to our lives, and a new dimension to our experiences. It is the perfect fit to get to a new level that is beneficial to our core. Our intellect is constantly challenged through creativity and it drives us with a different force finding the most profound feelings within ourselves. Time and space is ours and as global citizens we feel we can make formal visual statements that compel us to live our lives with intensity and constant personal development. The trans-formative power of the arts connects us. The passion inside us surfaces through the execution of work and allows precious and untouchable moments of intimacy with ourselves. It compels us to create a better world and a space that others like to visit. The inspiration of many, builds great cities that become magnets for visitors around the world. This is a celebration of creative practices. Inspiration is a joy to the soul and we hope to impact our audience, leading the way to a very exciting path. Keeping high standards, including multi-arts projects, and giving equal chance to emerging artists. Above all, to contribute showing the riches of our culture to a vibrant Toronto audience.</p>

In Chicago, Rita's father drove cab and was a chauffeur, transporting luminaries that included The Beatles, Lorne Green, and Bill Cosby. Howard bought Rita a clarinet and brother, Mark, a trumpet.

MISSION
Mateca Productions Inc. is committed to support music,
performance and visual arts. It has always been our aim to build strong
cultural bridges that support the diversity of our society, transforming and impacting our audiences through knowledge and respect of each other’s culture.
Artists have a catalytic effect, they are the hidden persuaders and those who reach the masses, foreseeing issues with more clarity. Their power is infinite.
Art gives purpose to our lives, and a new dimension to our experiences. It is the perfect fit to get to a new level that is beneficial to our core. Our intellect is constantly challenged through creativity and it drives us with a different force finding the most profound feelings within ourselves. Time and space is ours and as global citizens we feel we can make formal visual statements that compel us to live our lives with intensity and constant personal development. The trans-formative power of the arts connects us. The passion inside us surfaces through the execution of work and allows precious and untouchable moments of intimacy with ourselves. It compels us to create a better world and a space that others like to visit. The inspiration of many, builds great cities that become magnets for visitors around the world. This is a celebration of creative practices. Inspiration is a joy to the soul and we hope to impact our audience, leading the way to a very exciting path. Keeping high standards, including multi-arts projects, and giving equal chance to emerging artists. Above all, to contribute showing the riches of our culture to a vibrant Toronto audience.
ABOUT MATECA ARTS FESTIVAL
Mateca Arts Festival (MAF) is a festival of World Music and Multi-Disciplinary Art with a strong Latin American identity. It includes eclectic musicians, dancers and visual artists, with both National and International presentations. The Festival will take place Saturday & Sunday, June 7-8, 2014, at Burwash Quad Park,Victoria College, UofT.

We offer a variety of programs targeting different age groups and covering a lot of ground. A festival with a true and strong meaning!
Amongst the visual art exhibit, Universities of Canada & Latin America will display their work.Local community artists were encouraged to submit their artwork through “A Call to Artists”, to give them the chance to exhibit at the heart of UofT. A university that is a reflection of how ethnically diverse our city is. Geared towards creating ecological awareness, this year’s theme is: “Earth & Water”. Our Festival is an example of the strength of working together as a creative global village and building connectivity. We hope to achieve a positive social impact by facilitating a platform to:
·  Promote other organizations that help the
community through the arts· 
Develop visual arts programs at
Community Centres, currently working with WWCC ·  Create more
awareness of environmental issues through our festival program·  Build more awareness of environmental issues through our festival program
With an eye for detail and community support, the sky is the limit. We are very confident that this is
going to be an enjoyable celebration for all those involved and the wrap up
of years of experience. The festival intends to show a new vision of Latin American Culture, with very high standards and to support organizations and foundations that help individuals, especially youth through the arts.
We thank our partners: WWCC, Working Women Community Centre, Victoria College, University of Toronto, as well as the musicians, artists, volunteers and all those who worked hard in making this dream come true.

<p> </p>Short Summary
<div>Hi and welcome to our adventurous project. My names Tony and with the help of my lovely girlfriend Amanda we have created two deviant garden gnome prototypes.</div>
<div>Amanda and I met while working in a horse racing stable and have been partners for 3 years now. Amanda being an avid gardener would drag me around to garden centres every other weekend and while being bored, sprightly and mischevious I would often get sent to the 'garden gnome corner' and this is where the lightbulb moment came haha.</div>
<div>The intention for our campaign is to raise funds for these two erotic garden gnomes to be manufactured. The funds are essential for our first shipment of gnomes, we hope to order 1000 of each design. We are currently sourcing some cost estimates from Chinese factories.</div>
<div>We will make our backers a priority and will continue to do so in the future. We'll ship the gnome/s to our backers well before they are offered to the public. It is only fair that those who help us reach our goal get their gnomes first.</div>

In a monthly service that is part cabaret, part salon, part ceremony, we have presented hundreds of performers, musicians, visual artists, chefs, jugglers, magicians, clowns, dancers, poets, and films and served 1000s of community members of artists, activists, spiritualists, radicals, friends, performers and seekers of beauty. All of this at PAY-WHAT-YOU-CAN prices, for any and all who care to attend.We also provide FREE CHILDCARE and FREE COFFEE AND REFRESHMENTS after each service.
Once a year, we ask our community and outside supporters to contribute to our annual fund-drive. This is our ASK.
Impact
We are applying for non-profit incorporation right now. In the meantime, we rely solely on individual donations.


As a community-serving organization, we are dedicated to keeping our monthly gatherings pay-what-you-can. The donations received at our service do not cover the costs of our organization, thus most of our annual income comes from other donations and campaigns throughout the year.
 
Our annual budget this year is $66,000, and that includes one full-time paid staff member, and expenses like rent and supplies, childcare for our monthly services and ofice costs. The money from this campaign will go to those costs. 
 
Oh, and thanks to our fiscal sponsor, The Field*, your contribution is tax-deductible to the full extent of the law.

 
Our Goal and Other Ways to Help
Our funding goal this year is $30,000. And ANY AMOUNT HELPS!! So, in addition to giving, we really hope you'll help us spread the word - to your friends, family, on facebook and twitter. We've got some amazing gifts from our Secret City community, too.
*Regarding our Fiscal Sponsor

The Field is a not-for-profit, tax-exempt, 501(c)(3) organization serving the New York City performing arts community.

[Make a point to view the above 'GALLERY' & links + Web below, + incentives]
See what a difference we've made. Look above at the joyous kids in Kathmandu, today & look in 'Gallery', which shows the same youth a year ago, though eager, needing more support.
Iam Art director/co-ordinator, Vesa Peltonen, founder of this humanitarian organization, GLOBAL ArtXchanges. We're dedicated to sending art supplies to those youth into arts in impoverished or war-torn places world-wide. We've been successful getting materials (not money) into many places, since 2005. At this time it is a 'vision', call it a 'dream', to have this progress documented in a short film, which is of high importance for the growth of our network. To travel to meet young artists we have helped and create a film we can show the youth into arts would have many benefits. I hope you will CONTRIBUTE any amount.
I worked as an advisor for the Ontario Art Council. I've had a rewarding 30 yr. career in the arts, and it's time to give to arts in the World. This organization/network can be a role model for others. We have a growing worldwide group of contacts/volunteers & associates. We've created jobs.
This campaign is much about caring, compassion & determination. We want to enliven the youth who are in small art groups/art schools all over, that have many reasons to not get proper art supplies. (we don't send money). We only send the art materials/tools to our contact person, director/instructor requests. ~ We make sure they receive it. IT WORKS!  We won't stop half way after 6 yrs. 
 
Note of Importance:'GLOBAL ArtXchanges'already helped in Africa, Nepal, to S. America, and even in N.America we've sent art supplies successfully. The youth artists send us artwork, which will be used in a 'World Youth Art Peace Exhibition' in one of our two yr. phases t.b.a.. It was an incredible feeling to have students receive proper art materials Kathmandu, Nepal. Got there in only 7 working days from the  middle of Canada, ~Thunder Bay. They are now sustaining this art program, & we do the follow up.  I started by initially using my money. Now we receive funds from various sources, such as a funding foundation, to arts councils. We seek sponsors/patrons most importantly, to sustain our mission to move ahead with the documentary filming,now, while sending materials. Next is Cameroon. 
 
Response feedback: 'Lila'~Kathmandu, Nepal orphanage/school director: ""Thank you Vesa very much for art pencils,paints and papers and more, that our kids have now which has made them so happy making nice art. We want to send you some pictures later. Much love. - Namaste, Lila.
 

The Funds go to 3 areas:
(1)Sending Art Supplies to Needy Youth Art Groups World-wide is ongoing, so thus we need any contribution possible,~even $5.
(2)We are doing a short film documentary, for promotion, as well as send later a finished film to Film Festivals.
(3)To create a 'World Youth Art Peace' Exhibition, from the art given by the kids, we have helped. We have already received some.
 
The Impact 

This enlivens world youth, gives them hope, a sense of accomplishment, and affects in a positive way also their family, friends, & neighbourhood. Their Community will get involved, creating volunteering and jobs. We have already seen that happen, in Ghana for example. The community begins to share in the responsibility to sustain this effort.

What We Need & What You Get


We need to reach a minimum fundraising goal of $5,000. (U.S.) That is for 60 days.
Look NOW at the INCENTIVES for the various contribution levels & each one will give back something for your generosity. You can put in your own amount, press anonymous, if desire to. When you donate funds we'll need your e-mail to send any incentives to you.

<p>I was bullied from day one in Kindergarten. I remember it so clearly: Sitting next to another girl named Jessica I didn't yet know, the large open windows streaming in light from the gorgeous day outside. We were playing with puppets, and at the end of play period, Mrs. Gump, our teacher, told the class that it was time to clean up. The other girl kept playing, and when I repeated what Mrs. Gump had said, she bit me on the arm.</p>
<p>I don't remember what happened after that incident, but all those little things kept building up. An older girl on the bus telling me that I had a horrible voice and that I should stop singing, other kids teasing and ignoring me. By middle school, my classmates were spreading rumors about me, kicking me out of groups and conversations, making fun of me for the way I dressed or talked...and in one case, pushing me down the stairs.</p>
<p>I had thought that it stopped for the most part when I got to high school, but then one of my classmates, a jock I didn't know very well, came up to me and told me that one of my close friends was ridiculing me in front of one of her classes. He wanted me to know that she wasn't a true friend and he didn't want to see me hurt by her. It meant so much to me that he had done that.</p>
<p><strong><em>About the Project</em></strong></p>
<p>This project is going to consist of a combination of dark room and digital prints in black and white. My own body will be the subject matter, because of much of what happened to me was psychological, hidden scars that I want to make visible. My goal in creating this body of work is to discover just how far being bullied has affected my life, and with the hopes of coming to grips with at least a part of this, and begin the process of healing.</p>
<p>The body of work will consist of a semester-long journey of research, creation and discovery culminating in a series of 7-10 prints to be displayed in a gallery opening in early December 2012. With this work and research, I will also be writing a 15-25 page senior comp paper detailing my research, the work I have done, and the developments the work has brought about in my life. </p>
<p>All of the funds raised here will go towards my supply and equipment costs: a light meter for my film camera, necessary repairs to my DSLR camera, film, the photo paper on which I will print, mounting, and frames for the works, as well as any supplies I may use in the images I produce.</p>
<p><em><strong>About The Exhibit</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Where:</em> The Bownman Penelec Megahan Art Galleries of Allegheny College, 520 North Main Street, Meadville, PA 16335</p>
<p><em>When:</em> <span>Opening Reception: Tuesday, December 4, 7-9PM</span><br/><span>Exhibition Dates: December 4 – 12, 2012</span></p>
<p><em>Gallery Hours:</em> <span>12:30-5:00 Tuesday through Friday</span><br/><span>1:30-5:00 Saturday</span><br/><span>2:00-4:00 Sunday</span></p>
<p><em><strong>Can Backers Follow the Project-in-Progress?</strong></em></p>
<p>Absolutely! I will be posting blogs with my thoughts and progress on my website throughout the semester. Once the project has been completed, the prints up in the gallery and the paper printed and bound, I will create a space dedicated to this project on my website so that those unable to back my project and (in some cases) receive pieces of it, or who want to go back and look at it, will be able to. It will also be possible for people to discuss and comment on the page, in the hopes of some sort of dialogue on bullying coming from it. Everyone who backs this project will also receive a copy of my final 15-25 page paper.</p>
<p>My website: <a href=""http://mindscastshadows.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://mindscastshadows.wordpress.com/</a></p>
<p><em><strong>About Your Help</strong></em></p>
<p>With your help I will be able to fully realize this body of work that will allow me to understand more readily the depth of the effects of bullying on my psyche. Any contribution will help, even the smallest. Printing and framing such a large body of work is an expensive and almost impossible goal to reach with almost no funds. This is why I'm asking my family, friends, friends of family and friends of friends to, please, support me in this important project.</p>
<p><em><strong>About the Perks</strong></em></p>
<p>On the right you'll see a list of rewards and incentives for your donation. They range from $1 to $200, but you can donate whatever amount you want, even if it is not listed. You can choose which reward you want to receive of any your donation amount and lower.</p>

<p>-Anna Sobolov Good</p></div>","The Psychology of Bullying: A Search for Self-Acceptance
I was bullied from day one in Kindergarten. I remember it so clearly: Sitting next to another girl named Jessica I didn't yet know, the large open windows streaming in light from the gorgeous day outside. We were playing with puppets, and at the end of play period, Mrs. Gump, our teacher, told the class that it was time to clean up. The other girl kept playing, and when I repeated what Mrs. Gump had said, she bit me on the arm.
I don't remember what happened after that incident, but all those little things kept building up. An older girl on the bus telling me that I had a horrible voice and that I should stop singing, other kids teasing and ignoring me. By middle school, my classmates were spreading rumors about me, kicking me out of groups and conversations, making fun of me for the way I dressed or talked...and in one case, pushing me down the stairs.
I had thought that it stopped for the most part when I got to high school, but then one of my classmates, a jock I didn't know very well, came up to me and told me that one of my close friends was ridiculing me in front of one of her classes. He wanted me to know that she wasn't a true friend and he didn't want to see me hurt by her. It meant so much to me that he had done that.
About the Project
This project is going to consist of a combination of dark room and digital prints in black and white. My own body will be the subject matter, because of much of what happened to me was psychological, hidden scars that I want to make visible. My goal in creating this body of work is to discover just how far being bullied has affected my life, and with the hopes of coming to grips with at least a part of this, and begin the process of healing.
The body of work will consist of a semester-long journey of research, creation and discovery culminating in a series of 7-10 prints to be displayed in a gallery opening in early December 2012. With this work and research, I will also be writing a 15-25 page senior comp paper detailing my research, the work I have done, and the developments the work has brought about in my life. 
All of the funds raised here will go towards my supply and equipment costs: a light meter for my film camera, necessary repairs to my DSLR camera, film, the photo paper on which I will print, mounting, and frames for the works, as well as any supplies I may use in the images I produce.
About The Exhibit
Where: The Bownman Penelec Megahan Art Galleries of Allegheny College, 520 North Main Street, Meadville, PA 16335
When: Opening Reception: Tuesday, December 4, 7-9PMExhibition Dates: December 4 – 12, 2012
Gallery Hours: 12:30-5:00 Tuesday through Friday1:30-5:00 Saturday2:00-4:00 Sunday
Can Backers Follow the Project-in-Progress?
Absolutely! I will be posting blogs with my thoughts and progress on my website throughout the semester. Once the project has been completed, the prints up in the gallery and the paper printed and bound, I will create a space dedicated to this project on my website so that those unable to back my project and (in some cases) receive pieces of it, or who want to go back and look at it, will be able to. It will also be possible for people to discuss and comment on the page, in the hopes of some sort of dialogue on bullying coming from it. Everyone who backs this project will also receive a copy of my final 15-25 page paper.
My website: http://mindscastshadows.wordpress.com/
About Your Help
With your help I will be able to fully realize this body of work that will allow me to understand more readily the depth of the effects of bullying on my psyche. Any contribution will help, even the smallest. Printing and framing such a large body of work is an expensive and almost impossible goal to reach with almost no funds. This is why I'm asking my family, friends, friends of family and friends of friends to, please, support me in this important project.
About the Perks
On the right you'll see a list of rewards and incentives for your donation. They range from $1 to $200, but you can donate whatever amount you want, even if it is not listed. You can choose which reward you want to receive of any your donation amount and lower.
Other Ways You Can Help
I understand how difficult it is when you find a project you'd love to help out but just don't have the funds to do so. If that's the case for you, please let people know about my project! Blogs, facebook, twitter, email, word of mouth...anything you can do to help would be wonderful!
Thank you all! Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

<p>Rachel Selekman is an artist who makes sculpture and works on paper, and she’s been doing it, well, all her life, but you could say professionally since she received her BFA in 1985. A pretty long time no matter how you slice it. Trust me, I know, as I’m her.</p>
<p>On August 8, 2013, I’ll be turning the big “5” “0” and it’s time to survey my artistic career thus far and put it in print. That means publish my first monograph, a survey catalogue that will show the development of my sculpture and works on paper from the late 1980s to the present. </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/643528/pictures/full/20130201143115-Fresh_Purse.jpg?1359757884"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong> About the Catalogue</strong></p>
<p>The catalogue, called “Rachel Selekman: Making Connections,” with a print run of 1,000, will be filled with more than forty images of my sculpture and works on paper, so you’ll really get to see how my work has evolved over the years. It will include two essays, which will provide insight into why I do what I do, including my inspiration, interest in everyday objects, personal iconography, working method, and relationship to other artists and art movements, both past and present. It’ll be a good read!</p>
<p>One essay will be written by Margaret Mathews-Berenson, who is also organizing a traveling exhibition of my work, and I’m working on securing the second writer now. Of course, it will also include my biography. And it could very well include your name on the acknowledgment page (see the 5th perk). The catalogue will be published by the end of 2013.</p>
<p><strong>Why a Catalogue?</strong></p>
<p>Because it will be an amazingly helpful tool as well as a lasting document, showing my artistic accomplishments during the first half of my career.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s true that I’ve had numerous solo shows, that my works been included in even more group exhibitions all over the world, and that it’s in many private and public collections, including New York’s Museum of Modern Art, but there’s still much more to accomplish, lots of people in the ever-expanding art world who have never seen what I make, and, fundamentally, art is to be out in the world and this catalogue will help me get it out there—with your support!</p>
<p>It will also be a great complement to my website. The book will get folks intrigued and then they can go to my website to see even more work, read lots of reviews, my artist statement, and see the very latest work. It will also be a valuable accompaniment to my traveling show, which Margaret Mathews-Berenson is organizing as I mentioned above.</p>
<p><strong>This Campaign</strong></p>
<p>I’ve given this campaign a lot of thought. And in thinking about it and planning it, it dawned on me that it’s really another expression, or form, of my art. My work has always been a means of communication, a way to connect. For instance, many of the sculptures reach out to the viewer, drawing you in and enveloping you. The everyday objects I use (purses and watering cans) are familiar and make the work approachable, and often humorous, as these objects are absurd in their new manifestations. The works on paper entice with their compositions, materials, and intricate process. The point is, I want the viewer to have a personal, unique experience/connection with my art, and I also want to connect with you through this campaign, because you’re my friends, family, peers, colleagues, and fellow artists, or you’re supporting me because someone we know in common thought you’d be interested in this project. So thanks for taking this ride with me, and for your love and support.</p>

<p><strong>Your Impact</strong></p>
<p>Is huge! Your contirbutions are going to help me, a devoted, hardworking artist, by impacting the development of my work and my career in a tangible way. And by doing so, you more broadly acknowledge that art matters and is an integral and critical part of our society.</p>
<p>As for the particulars, your donations will pay for all the costs to produce the catalogue: the graphic designer, two writers, printing (which alone is about $10,000), an editor, postage and envelopes, and photography. (Photography too is a significant expense, but it’s critical. The images have to top-notch, and photography has changed so much. Remember film? Remember the first digital cameras? Well, I’ll have to have some of my older work reshot and slides and 4 x 5 transparencies professionally scanned, plus there’s new work to be photographed as well.)</p>

<p>Galaneicia's disheartening confession was overheard while at a Schwab Elementary debate tournament.  Our students were floored by Schwab's incredible murals plastered throughout each hall.  This prompted Galaneicia to admit how embarrassed she'd be for Kirkpatrick to host such an event.  <em>She did not want other students to see where she goes to school</em>.  We aim to change these negative impression of Kirkpatrick by putting up unique designs that showcase our incredible spirit!</p>

<h1><strong>What is this? A school of child models?</strong></h1>
<p>We are totally playing the ""cute kid"" card.  We’ve stuffed our video with enough <strong>adorable</strong> <strong>faces</strong> and student testimony (not featured: Sarah McLachlan vocals and puppies) to tug on your heartstrings.   If not, what are you? A<em> robot</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Just kidding!!</strong></p>
<p>We do hope that our video gives you a brief, although incomplete, glimpse into student life at Kirkpatrick. We want to brag on all of the shiny, happy faces pictured above who smile in spite of spending the majority of their day in a school with lackluster features.  </p>
<h1>Get to the nitty gritty! </h1>
<h3><strong>What's the plan?</strong></h3>
<p>This July 2013 we will create <strong>7</strong> <strong>murals</strong> that are both current and relatable to our stellar, student population!  The murals are a collaboration with <em>graffiti masterminds</em> and are founded in <em>student designs</em>.  Each <strong>unique</strong> work will focus on motivating students and promoting academic growth.  They will also be <strong>gorgeous--</strong>Bonus points!</p>
<p>We need to raise $4,000 to cover all costs and make this project a reality.  Our campaign is <em><strong>all-or-nothing</strong>.</em> That means if we don't reach our total, we get <strong><em>zero</em></strong> funding (and you won't be charged).  We need a lot of community support and promotion to successfully fund the murals.</p>
<h3>What will my donation go towards?</h3>
<p>We need your help to securely cover the following project details:</p>
<p>-Paint and painting supplies for artists and volunteers,</p>
<p>-Opening the school during the summer,</p>
<p>-Stencil art materials and production fees</p>
<p>-Covering fees from Indiegogo and payment transactions</p>
<p>In return for your generous donations, you will receive some of the perks packages described on the upper-right side of the page.  We love the graffiti artists' work so much that we want to share it with you all- check 'em out!</p>
<h3><strong>More background information, please.</strong></h3>

<p>Even amongst the incredible strengths of our Cayce community, many of our kids experience difficult and unstable situations.  School is supposed to represent the safe and enriching place where students' dreams can flourish and they feel encouraged. Yet many of our students are all too aware of our uninspired structure and they feel <strong>ashamed</strong> of their learning environment.</p>
<p>We know that for academics, aesthetics are not usually at the top of a to-do list.  However, there is a lot of <strong><a href=""http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/arts_smarts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">research</a></strong> that supports the <em>effect of an art-filled environment on student achievement</em>.  And who doesn't want students to succeed?  Again with the<em> robots</em>.  So let’s bring in some paint, y'all!</p>
<div> </div>
<h1>Grade A artists.</h1>
<h3>Who is involved?</h3>
<div>In order for this to have the amazing outcome the children deserve, we have to assemble an A-Team of artists!  We’re not just grabbing anyone off the street to lead this project… </div>
<p>...okay, so actually we are. </p>
<p>Legit street artists to be specific.  We’ve called in reinforcements from <strong><a href=""http://19ss.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nathan Brown</a></strong> and <a href=""http://www.nashvillescene.com/countrylife/archives/2012/03/14/workforce-rebellions-bryan-deese-on-nashville-street-art-and-saturdays-art-opening"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WorkForce Rebellion</a>'s <strong>Audie Adams</strong> (<em>AudRoc</em> as he's known amongst cooler crowds).  They are two amazing street muralists known for their vibrant, larger-than-life works painted around Nashville and inside a few lucky schools.  ""Don’t believe me?

<h1>Why we need you.</h1>
<p>You've heard our story and seen our vision.  We have all the pieces in place to make this project meaningful, <em>except one</em>.  We need your help to jump a major hurdle and show students like Galaneicia we can bring this dream to life.  Join in as an honorary Cougar and <strong>create an impact</strong> that extends beyond the beautification of a school hallway.  Together we can generate student achievement in a way that is creative and long-lasting! </p>
<h3><strong>Ways to help:</strong></h3>
<p>- Donate a contribution to our project page </p>
<p>- Spread the word by any means available (carrier pigeon, facebook status, etc.)</p>
<h3><strong>Updates:</strong></h3>
<p>If you partner with us, you can expect silly project updates along the way!  You will get an inside look at mural production, student reactions, and of course the finished product!</p>
<p>Help us provide a brand new school to students this Fall and create the community kickoff of a <em>lifetime</em>!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Potential risks and challenges:</h3>
<p>As with any project, there is the possibility for obstacles and delays. As it currently stands, the project is set to be completed over a handful of days in early-mid July 2013 in time for the start of the school year on August 1! We will do everything in our power to adhere to our set timeline for both the project and incentives packages. Nathan and Audie are kind of a big deal so if production of reward paintings gets backed up we will notify you ASAP! </p>
<p>But fear not! We already have the crew of local artists who are more than capable of completing the job. We have approval from our administration and examples of similar project success stories within our school district. Lastly, we have a very hyped student body and staff. All that to say, if something should arise that puts our plan off track, you all will be the first to know about how we're fixing it!  We strive for ultimate transparency in all that we do with this project.</p>

We know that for academics, aesthetics are not usually at the top of a to-do list.  However, there is a lot of research that supports the effect of an art-filled environment on student achievement.  And who doesn't want students to succeed?  Again with the robots.  So let’s bring in some paint, y'all!
 
Grade A artists.
Who is involved?
In order for this to have the amazing outcome the children deserve, we have to assemble an A-Team of artists!  We’re not just grabbing anyone off the street to lead this project… 
...okay, so actually we are. 
Legit street artists to be specific.  We’ve called in reinforcements from Nathan Brown and WorkForce Rebellion's Audie Adams (AudRoc as he's known amongst cooler crowds).  They are two amazing street muralists known for their vibrant, larger-than-life works painted around Nashville and inside a few lucky schools.  ""Don’t believe me? Just watch!"" Click the image below to get an idea of what we're talking about.

 
We know.  They're incredibly cool cats.
We've put some of our own cats on the job too!  Our Kirkpatrick Cougars submitted their ideas to Nathan and Audie as student-initiated guides for their mural designs. 

Growing the next generation's Picasso.

Student artwork! Note the Sponge Bob.
Thanks to Nathan, Audie, and many others around the city, Nashville is becoming a proud hub for public art.  If we value the city enough to beautify even the most forgotten buildings, then surely we can value our students enough to awaken pride in places of great importance, like schools.  Right?  Right!
Check out all of Nathan's and Audie's works on this page as well as their site links.  We hope they give you an idea of how great your reward paintings will be!

A glimpse of genius.
Why we need you.
You've heard our story and seen our vision.  We have all the pieces in place to make this project meaningful, except one.  We need your help to jump a major hurdle and show students like Galaneicia we can bring this dream to life.  Join in as an honorary Cougar and create an impact that extends beyond the beautification of a school hallway.  Together we can generate student achievement in a way that is creative and long-lasting! 
Ways to help:
- Donate a contribution to our project page 
- Spread the word by any means available (carrier pigeon, facebook status, etc.)
Updates:
If you partner with us, you can expect silly project updates along the way!  You will get an inside look at mural production, student reactions, and of course the finished product!
Help us provide a brand new school to students this Fall and create the community kickoff of a lifetime!
 
 
Potential risks and challenges:
As with any project, there is the possibility for obstacles and delays. As it currently stands, the project is set to be completed over a handful of days in early-mid July 2013 in time for the start of the school year on August 1! We will do everything in our power to adhere to our set timeline for both the project and incentives packages. Nathan and Audie are kind of a big deal so if production of reward paintings gets backed up we will notify you ASAP! 
But fear not! We already have the crew of local artists who are more than capable of completing the job. We have approval from our administration and examples of similar project success stories within our school district. Lastly, we have a very hyped student body and staff. All that to say, if something should arise that puts our plan off track, you all will be the first to know about how we're fixing it!  We strive for ultimate transparency in all that we do with this project.
Your faith and support is incredible! :)",8.0,0,"1 Campaign
