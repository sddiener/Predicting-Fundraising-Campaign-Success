<p><b><i>Time Spanners</i></b> was created by <b>John Vourlis</b>, a graduate of USC Film
School and a published author, and <b>Jaime
Lombardo</b>, a successful graphic artist and illustrator who’s done hundreds
of illustrations for role playing games. John and Jaime grew up together in
Wickliffe, Ohio, and a drawing that Jaime did was the initial inspiration for <b><i>Time
Spanners</i></b> (you can see it in the video here). When John saw the drawing,
he was so blown away he immediately wanted to write a movie based on it. He and
Jaime toiled long and hard on that screenplay, and when it was finished, they
were lucky enough to have it read by several Hollywood producers who were
intrigued by the idea. Like many a movie script, though, it never got made.
John and Jaime were disappointed, but realistic. Movies like this cost tens, if
not, hundreds of millions of dollars to make. Undaunted, they toyed around with
turning their screenplay into a novel, but that didn’t feel right. </p>
<p>Then
one day, John was talking with his pal, the talented filmmaker and comic book
artist Ted Sikora, about how much he
loved the idea of comics, especially the purity and simplicity of the
storytelling. Ted told John that nowadays it’s not hard to self-publish a
comic, and then Ted said the magic words, “Why don’t you turn one of your
scripts into one? You’ll have a blast doing it.” And thus <b><i>Time Spanners</i></b> as a
comic book was born. </p>
<p>There
was just one small problem. With Jaime busy running his own graphic design
company, and John incapable of drawing anything but stick
figures, the two friends needed to find an experienced comic book artist to
collaborate with on the project. John then had the good fortune of meeting
<b>Brendan Kelly</b> at a bar in Cleveland. Brendan turned out to be a multi-talented artist:
an actor, musician, and author of his own cool comics. Over corned beef sandwiches
a few weeks and a few beers later, John pitched Brendan the idea of turning the
<i><b>Time Spanners</b></i> script into a series of
comic books, and Brendan was hooked. The rest, we hope, will be history. <b>To find out MORE ABOUT THE COMIC and the STORY click on the GALLERY TAB.</b></p>
<h2><b>WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET</b></h2>
<p>If you're not
familiar with <i>Indiegogo</i> or crowd-funding
in general, here's a brief overview: </p>
<p>For the next
45 days, you'll be able to make pledges to help support the creation of Issue
#1 of <b><i>Time Spanners</i></b>, ranging from $5 to $250. You can select
one of the perks on the right, corresponding to the amount you wish to donate.
This means <b>you're not only helping us out, you are also receiving some cool stuff
in return! </b></p>
<p><b>Our goal is to
raise $2500 to finish Issue #1 and get started on
Issue #2. </b>Our dream is to turn the entire script into a graphic
novel one day, which will ultimately be composed of 10 or 12 issues of the
comic. We have the first 7 pages penciled and inked, and you can see some of the results here:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/429259/files/20140312143940-timespanners_page1_small.jpg?1394660380"" src="""" style=""width: 166.36666666666667px; height: 253px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/429262/files/20140312144208-timespanners_page4_small.jpg?1394660528"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em; width: 192.2830188679245px; height: 258px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/429265/files/20140312144356-timespanners_page5_small.jpg?1394660636"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em; width: 183.1087613293051px; height: 267px;""/><br/><br/><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The money we’re raising now will go towards paying Brendan to finish

<p>We have chosen
a Flexible Funding program so that whatever money you donate will go directly
to completion of Issue #1 (and any potential future issues), no matter if we
reach our goal of $2500 or not. If we don’t make our goal, <i>Indiegogo</i> just takes
a slightly larger percentage (9% instead of 4%), so it’s in our best interest,
and yours, for us to reach or surpass that goal! </p>
<h2><b>YOUR IMPACT</b></h2>
<p>Without your help, we
won’t be able to realize our dream of turning <i><b>Time Spanners</b></i> into a comic book, and hopefully down the road into a
graphic novel.  It takes lots of time, no
pun intended, and lots and lots of effort to draw each panel of a comic book. You
can see the detailed work that goes into one such panel (of at least 22 needed)
in the video.  Brendan has been kind enough
to create the first seven pages gratis, but an artist can only get so far on corned
beef sandwiches alone, and we've been fortunate to get someone as talented as
Brendan to help us get this far. The average cost per issue for an experienced
comic book illustrator is $3000 and up. Brendan, with our help, is happy to
work for less because he loves the project so much. So now it’s time for us to
pay the man and finish the job. We’d love to be able to just write him a check,
but without your help, that’s not possible.</p>
<p>As artists, we ultimately
rely on the public’s support, one way or another. If you like the products we
create, you buy them. In the bad old days, we’d have had to pitch this to comic
book companies to get them to publish our comic, but in this day and age of
crowd-funding and self-publishing, we don’t need those guys. <b>All we need is
you! </b></p>
<p>So if you like what we’re
trying to do here, if you’re as excited about it as we are, then by making a
pledge, you can help us launch the <b><i>Time Spanners</i></b> comic. Your donation
will make you a comic book producer just like Marvel or DC! How cool is
that!?  And with so many avenues out
there to sell the comic, including our favorite great local brick and mortar store, Comic Heaven, as well as websites like Comixology.com,
Indyplanet.com, and of course Amazon.com on the internet, you will be able to
point to <b><i>Time Spanners</i></b> and say, “I helped get that comic made!”</p>
<h2><b>HOW YOU CAN HELP</b></h2>
<p>Some
people just can’t contribute much, if anything—as starving artists ourselves,
we understand that.  That’s why we’ve
made it possible for you to pledge as little as $5 to get a reward (in our
case, a digital download of Issue #1). For those of you who can’t donate for whatever reason,
we ask you to help us get the word out and make some noise about our campaign,
via email, Facebook, or word of mouth. You can even use the<i> Indiegogo</i> share tools to help!</p>
<h4><b>If
you can, make a pledge, help us realize our dream, and get a cool reward to boot! Thank you!</b></h4><p></p><p></p></div>","WHO ARE WE?

is a demolition rock band from Saskatoon, about to release their fourth album, a double concept album called Ad Astra featuring an 88 page full color comic ""jam"" of 12 different artists interpreting each song on the album.  The album is complete, all the art for the comic is ready for print, and we have over half of the money needed for full color printing, but we are short funds needed to bring this project to a close.  To date we have invested almost 20g into this project and ask you to pre-buy the album/ comic in order to help complete it.  The cd/ graphic novel combo is a limited edition.
Ultimate Power Duo
has released four full-length albums, four eps, and have played through the UK, US, and Canada incuding SXSW, the Great Escape, Warped Tour, Vancouver Olympics and have opened for Bad Religion, Nomeansno, the Vibrators, Sloan, Bif Naked, and many more.
 
""Next up are Saskatoon’s brilliantly named Ultimate Power Duo. Naturally enough, UPD are in fact a classic power trio of riffs, pummeling drums all kept in check by a low end rumble to make Mike Watt jealous. Fresh from being handpicked as a support act for Bad Religion by Jay Bentley himself and a handful of dates with Canadian punk legends NomeansNo under their belt, The UPD are a vacuum tight punk rock unit, playing a self proclaimed ‘Demolition Rock”- theirs is the music that would be made if the neo-garage rock of The Hives or Rocket From The Crypt played a game of Chicken with The Minutemen and The Ramones and neither backed down. Clad in an all black uniform they know they’re r’n’r history, nodding to The Minutemen’s “If Reagan Played Disco” during the intro to the no-wave onslaught that is “Noam Disco”. The beauty of UPD is the clear delight they take in playing- a reminder that life is too short to not enjoy yourself and a celebration of living in, and for the moment. Their set ends with both non-drumming members performing Pete Townesend-esque windmills before launching their guitars into the roof of the building."" www.thelineofbestfit.com Canadian Blast Review, The Great Escape Festival UK
 
Ultimate Power Duo: Space Joe: Ad Astra The Graphic Novel
 
“It would not be too much to say that myth is the secret opening through which the inexhaustible energies of the cosmos pour into human cultural manifestation.  Religions, philosophies, arts, the social forms of primitive and historic man, prime discoveries in science and technology, the very dreams that blister sleep, boil up from the basic, magic ring of myth.” Joseph Campbell –The Hero with a Thousand Faces
Vishnu.  Gilgamesh.  Beowulf.  Ulysses.  Buddha.  Jesus.  Luke Skywalker.  Neo. 
Prepare to meet the new name in mythic, epic story telling. 
Space Joe.  
Ultimate Power Duo presents the next character in humanity’s mono-myth, a near future character who, while exploring his true inner meaning and life path, changes humankind’s perceptions of reality and existence. 
Space Joe: Ad Astra  follows the story of a boy named Joe, an Air Force army brat who has his first experience with zero gravity in high school, before finally making his full ascension to the stars as an adult.  Once among the regions of space, Space Joe meets an amazing array of characters, discovers a new meaning to his life, and creates a celestial course previously uncharted by any other human being.  
Ultimate Power Duo has taken on their biggest challenge yet; a twenty two track concept album following a single, continuative story line released simultaneously in audio and sequential art formats. 
The Adventures of Space Joe: Ad Astra is a jam comic in the true sense of the word; twelve different artists represent their individual artistic styling to the twenty two songs turning the Ad Astra concept album into Ad Astra the graphic novel.   Based on notes regarding song lyrics, story lines, character descriptions, and plot points, each artist created their own distinct storyline and script while retaining a plot driven story. 
The Adventures of Space Joe: Ad Astra-The Graphic Novel is a true conglomeration of multi-genre artistic endeavour.  The artwork ranges from the Golden Age inspired Donny Sparrow, the neo-Silver Age work of Nathan Wall, the Iron Age look of Ken Davis, the cartoon inspired Jordyn Bochon and Elaine Wall, and the feathered lined abstractions of Cate Francis.   
A project of immense scope, artistic outlooks and varied styles, Space Joe: Ad Astra The Graphic Novel is an immense work representing Canada’s greatest talent.          
Ad Astra The Album: Ultimate Power Duo has taken on their biggest challenge yet; a 22 track concept album following a single, continuative story line while simultaneously displaying themselves at their most musically innovative, daring to explore previously un-delved genres and styles. 
Produced by UPD and Barrett Ross (Colour Field, Foam Lake, The Bloodlines) and mixed and mastered by  Dave Carswell of JCDC (New Pornographers, Tegan and Sara),  Space Joe: Ad Astra – To the Stars is highly accessible and highly dynamic featuring straight-ahead driving rock songs (“Chasing Airwaves” and “Gyles Coyote: Inspirational Speaker”), slower, introspective melodies (“My Memory” and “Captain Joe and the Wayward Star Ship (Star-Crossed Lovers Cross the Stars)”), long narratives with ambient keyboards, space sounds and historical news footage regarding space missions and moon landings (“Noveture”), and spoken word musical theatre accompanied by thick, trudging guitar riffs and robotic anti-humanity ranting (“An Oral History of the Robotic Revolution, Liberation and Subjugation of Spero Spondeo”).  These diverse elements elucidate essential UPD in delivery and attitude pontificating intelligent song writing, dry humour, outrageous creativity and wit. 
In the vein of The Who’s Tommy and Quadrophenia, The Kinks’ Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire) and Pink Floyd’s The Dark Side of the Moon, Space Joe: Ad Astra is a beginning to end musical journey and epic story-telling experience. 
Ultimate Power Duo has reclaimed the art of true album making.

<p><strong>La Bande Dessinée ""Parcours de Migrantes""</strong></p>
<p>Après avoir édité trois tomes de la collection BD ""Les Migrants"", nous souhaitons finaliser une œuvre spécifique favorisant la connaissance sur la migration féminine en France.</p>
<p>L'objectif est de créer un ouvrage de récits biographiques illustrés, pour diffuser et partager les témoignages réalisés avec des migrantes originaires de pays francophones et non francophones. Cet ouvrage est réalisé dans le cadre d’une collection destinée au grand public, aux femmes migrantes, à la jeunesse, aux établissements scolaires, aux réseaux sociaux francophones.</p>

<p>Ces parcours s’articulent autour des mêmes thématiques : l’enfance dans le pays d’origine, le contexte historique et économique, les raisons du départ et le départ, l’intégration en France.</p>
<p><strong>Sélectionnés à partir des biographies réalisées par Frédéric Praud,  ces récits sont mis en dessins par deux dessinateurs Kiel et Hamed Borsali et scénarisés par Florence Brèthes. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Présentation des récits </strong></p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Mai Ling - Vietnam</span></p>
<p>Mai Ling naît en 1940 à Hoa Lu, qui fait alors partie de l’Indochine française. De sousmissions en violences, c’est par les mots et l’écriture qu’elle a repris en mains le cours de sa vie.

Paroles d'Hommes et de Femmes
L’association Paroles d’Hommes et de Femmes utilise la mémoire recueillie dans tous les lieux et sous toutes ses formes, pour créer du lien social. L’histoire individuelle et collective peut être une source d’animation interculturelle et intergénérationnelle, une source de création, une source de pédagogie. La mémoire des aînés migrants, peut permettre de construire l’avenir des jeunes si on leur donne la possibilité de créer des liens intergénérationnels directs, d’écouter et de vivre le quotidien des personnes qui les ont précédées.

La Bande Dessinée ""Parcours de Migrantes""
Après avoir édité trois tomes de la collection BD ""Les Migrants"", nous souhaitons finaliser une œuvre spécifique favorisant la connaissance sur la migration féminine en France.
L'objectif est de créer un ouvrage de récits biographiques illustrés, pour diffuser et partager les témoignages réalisés avec des migrantes originaires de pays francophones et non francophones. Cet ouvrage est réalisé dans le cadre d’une collection destinée au grand public, aux femmes migrantes, à la jeunesse, aux établissements scolaires, aux réseaux sociaux francophones.

http://www.parolesdhommesetdefemmes.fr/les-migrantes-article001102.html
http://www.lettresetmemoires.net/bandes-dessinees-200041.htm
L’ouvrage présente six récits de femmes migrantes issues de différents pays : Mongia - Tunisie, N'deye - Sénégal, Diana - Liban, Deepa - Inde, Mai Ling - Vietnam, Alice - Portugal.
Ces parcours s’articulent autour des mêmes thématiques : l’enfance dans le pays d’origine, le contexte historique et économique, les raisons du départ et le départ, l’intégration en France.
Sélectionnés à partir des biographies réalisées par Frédéric Praud,  ces récits sont mis en dessins par deux dessinateurs Kiel et Hamed Borsali et scénarisés par Florence Brèthes. 
 
Présentation des récits 
Mai Ling - Vietnam
Mai Ling naît en 1940 à Hoa Lu, qui fait alors partie de l’Indochine française. De sousmissions en violences, c’est par les mots et l’écriture qu’elle a repris en mains le cours de sa vie. Ecrire les blessures de son histoire, afin de faire comprendre que la vie de la petite fille soumise et solitaire qu’elle était à la femme volontaire mais rejetée qu’elle est devenue, correspond au poids de sa culture.

N’deye - Sénégal 
N’Deye naît en 1961 à Dakar. Séparée de ses parents, elle grandit avec ce sentiment d’injustice, et mène une carrière professionnelle au service de l’autre. Porteuse d’une double culture sénégalaise et française, elle en reconnaît une troisième, la culture vendéenne, à laquelle elle reste attachée, même si aujourd’hui, elle vit et travaille à Niort.

Deepa- Inde 
Deepa naît en 1948 à Calcutta. Issue d’une famille brahmane et bengalie, elle s’attache à promouvoir et faire connaître la culture indienne en France. Aujourd’hui française de nationalité et indienne de personnalité, Deepa participe, par le biais de son association, à la rencontre de ses deux cultures.

Mongia - Tunisie 
Mongia naît en 1951 à Lamta près de Monastir. De son enfance difficile, elle n’a de cesse de faire sortir les femmes des ténèbres en les aidant à accéder à leur indépendance. Devenue animatrice, sa vie est à Angers, mais elle reste fière et attachée à sa culture tunisienne, qu’elle a transmise à ses enfants.
 Diana - Liban 
Diana Saad naît en 1960 à Aïchié, près de la frontière israélienne. D’un pays adoré au déchirement de la guerre, c’est par amour qu’elle vient en France. Malgré les difficultés, elle s’adapte, travaille, élève ses enfants. Une Française au cœur libanais.
 Alice - Portugal 
Alice naît en 1955 à Souto da Casa. De son petit village au Portugal à sa vie en France, elle n’a cessé de se battre pour vivre pleinement son indépendance. Reconnaissante à la France, elle reste portugaise et transmet sa culture à ses enfants, qui aujourd’hui, continuent d’agrandir cette famille multiculturelle.

<p>I am K Massop and I am the writer / founder of the “Fate Of The Gods” project.</p>
<p>I have spent the last 19 years developing a storyline that spans 4 novels with 1 already published though it is currently being reworked into a second edition.</p>
<p>When people ask “what is this story about?” it’s hard to put into a short sentence as it scales to epic proportions.

<p>Last year I setup a Facebook group which focused on discussing the first novel and of the 300 members at the time around 200 said that this must be brought to the illustrated theatre as it has a lot of events that would be better portrayed as images. After unsuccessfully funding a graphic novel (I only managed to get to 10 pages before I was dead broke) I realised I will need help to make this dream a reality.</p>

<p>My name is Ryan Claytor and I write and illustrate a series of autobiographical comics titled, <em>And Then One Day</em>.  With your help, I’d like to publish my most recent story arc, <em>Autobiographical Conversations</em>, as a 96-page collected edition.</p>

<p><em>Autobiographical Conversations</em> centers on a discussion between Harry Polkinhorn (a professor of English who teaches classes on the personal essay) and me (at the time, a graduate student studying Comics and Fine Art) about autobiography, comics, and the intersection of the two. </p>
<p>I have spent several years researching, developing, and illustrating this project and I’m eager to share it with you in its final collected edition, as I envisioned it from the start.  My hope is that the comics medium will provide a more visual approach to understanding autobiographical theory and framing the subject matter in the context of a conversation will allow the reader to feel more engaged, almost as though they were part of that conversation unfolding. </p>
<p><strong>What is Needed</strong></p>
<p>The $3,000 goal will allow me to have 1,000 copies of this project professionally offset-printed in a single volume.  While the original mini-comics had print-runs between 100-300 copies per issue, this larger quantity will give me the opportunity to reach a broader audience through national distribution. </p>

</h3><div>Hello! My name is Marie Louise, I'm 19 years old and I'm a university student. I'm currently attending the study 'Business IT &amp; Management', which is basically a mix between the regular IT study and a Management study. I'm in my second year, out of the total four years. Halfway there! My life long dream job is something else though.</div><div>My campaign us all about my hobby: drawing. I've loved to draw for as long as I can remember and I've started draw 'professionally' around the age of 13. When I started drawing professionally, I also started investing in my materials. I discovered the magic of Copic Markers! They are wonderful tools for traditional coloring and I've used them ever since I bought my first couple of markers. <span style="""">Not only is this my hobby, it is actually my dream to be able to support myself with a job in the drawing/art industry.</span><span style=""""> </span>
</div><div>As some of may know, with nice equipment usually comes a nice price tag! Copic markers are pretty expensive. Besides from the coloring tools, I also have to buy Copic marker suited paper (the marker ink will bleed terribly on printer paper :( ).</div><div>As I am a university student and live on my own, I don't have much money to fund my hobby with anymore, or anything else for that matter. Not to sound pitiful, but I can barely afford clothes, aiii! I already have a job on the side, but that is only enough for me to be able to pay my gas/electric bill.</div><div>To achieve my goal of being able to support myself financially with my hobby, I've noticed that today's art consumers are loving digital art and traditional (cartoon/anime) art is slowly fading to the background. This is why I want to broaden my horizon by also entering the digital art market!</div><div>So I've been thinking: in what way should in contribute to the digital art market and hopefully get customers for commissions? What is the one thing you need for producing digital art? Right! A graphical tablet. So I've done some researching a tried out a couple of drawing tablets. So what kind of tablet do I need? One with a screen, because it is closest to traditional drawing and I'm very comfortable drawing with it. So what do I need funding for? The Wacom Cintiq companion, which came out not too long ago. It is the perfect tablet AND laptop in one. I feel very comfortable drawing on it, I can use it just like a laptop and install any drawing program I want to use (unlike the Wacom Cintiq Companion Hybrid, which runs on Android).</div><div><br/></div><h3>So, what's in it for you?</h3><div>
<div>So why the Cintiq Companion and not a cheaper alternative like the Wacom Cintiq 13HD? My current laptop has pretty low specifications and it doesn't run any art programs smoothly, Adobe Photoshop for example. This means it won't get any better on a regular screen tablet. The Cintiq Companion does not only have the benefit of being a laptop, it is also very portable and can be used without having it plugged in! This makes it a lot easier to sketch/doodle directly on my tablet/laptop and makes practicing my digital skills possible anywhere at any time!</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>By donating €5, you will receive a personal thank you e-mail from me!</li>
<li>By donating €10 or more, you will receive a personal thank you letter, written on custom stationary, from me!</li>
<li>By donating €25, you will receive an original custom sketch drawn by me. This sketch will be of the subject of your choice, so basically it's like a commission!</li>
<li>By donating €50, you will receive a custom flat colored drawing by me. This drawing will be of the subject of your choice, so again, basically like a commission! Flat colored means it's colored, but not shaded.</li>
<li>By donating €80, you will receive a custom full colored drawing by me. This drawing will be of the subject of your choice, basically a commission, yay!</li>
</ul>
<div>The subject of the drawing will be discussed by you and me together. Of course I have my things which I won't draw for you, like explicit pornography and explicit violence. You will also get to pick whether you want original art or digital art! Keep in mind though, when you pick digital art it won't come your way immediately since I will first have to buy a graphical tablet haha.</div>
</div>
<div>If I do not reach my goal and do not raise enough money for the Wacom Cintiq Companion, I will either save up more money until I do have enough to buy the tablet OR I will have to compromise and buy a cheaper tablet, like the Cintiq 13HD.</div>
</div><div><br/></div><p></p><p></p><h3>So, what if I reach my goal?</h3><div>This project would not only help me be able to reach my dream, it also means something for you and the rest of the world! You will gain a digital artist who will keep on broadening her horizon and practicing her skills to become the best! You will be able to commission me for digital art commissions and receive some fabulous art to frame and hang somewhere in your house!</div><div><br/></div><p></p><p></p><h3>Not able to contribute?</h3><p>Don't worry, I won't get mad at you. I understand that there are a lot of people who are in a similar situation like me, financially wise. So it's not all about money! But then what else can you do to help me with my campaign?</p><p>Share this campaign and tell your friends about it! It's not much work and doesn't cost a dime.</p><p>Contributors and non-contributors: thank you all and hopefully together we can help another artist get her hobby on track and direct it to becoming more than just a hobby! </p><p>If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask me :)</p></div>","(A personal video is on the way!)

What is the one thing you need for producing digital art? Right! A graphical tablet. So I've done some researching a tried out a couple of drawing tablets. So what kind of tablet do I need? One with a screen, because it is closest to traditional drawing and I'm very comfortable drawing with it. So what do I need funding for? The Wacom Cintiq companion, which came out not too long ago. It is the perfect tablet AND laptop in one. I feel very comfortable drawing on it, I can use it just like a laptop and install any drawing program I want to use (unlike the Wacom Cintiq Companion Hybrid, which runs on Android).So, what's in it for you?
So why the Cintiq Companion and not a cheaper alternative like the Wacom Cintiq 13HD? My current laptop has pretty low specifications and it doesn't run any art programs smoothly, Adobe Photoshop for example. This means it won't get any better on a regular screen tablet. The Cintiq Companion does not only have the benefit of being a laptop, it is also very portable and can be used without having it plugged in! This makes it a lot easier to sketch/doodle directly on my tablet/laptop and makes practicing my digital skills possible anywhere at any time!


By donating €5, you will receive a personal thank you e-mail from me!
By donating €10 or more, you will receive a personal thank you letter, written on custom stationary, from me!
By donating €25, you will receive an original custom sketch drawn by me. This sketch will be of the subject of your choice, so basically it's like a commission!
By donating €50, you will receive a custom flat colored drawing by me. This drawing will be of the subject of your choice, so again, basically like a commission! Flat colored means it's colored, but not shaded.
By donating €80, you will receive a custom full colored drawing by me. This drawing will be of the subject of your choice, basically a commission, yay!

The subject of the drawing will be discussed by you and me together. Of course I have my things which I won't draw for you, like explicit pornography and explicit violence. You will also get to pick whether you want original art or digital art! Keep in mind though, when you pick digital art it won't come your way immediately since I will first have to buy a graphical tablet haha.

If I do not reach my goal and do not raise enough money for the Wacom Cintiq Companion, I will either save up more money until I do have enough to buy the tablet OR I will have to compromise and buy a cheaper tablet, like the Cintiq 13HD.
So, what if I reach my goal?This project would not only help me be able to reach my dream, it also means something for you and the rest of the world! You will gain a digital artist who will keep on broadening her horizon and practicing her skills to become the best! You will be able to commission me for digital art commissions and receive some fabulous art to frame and hang somewhere in your house!Not able to contribute?Don't worry, I won't get mad at you. I understand that there are a lot of people who are in a similar situation like me, financially wise. So it's not all about money! But then what else can you do to help me with my campaign?Share this campaign and tell your friends about it! It's not much work and doesn't cost a dime.Contributors and non-contributors: thank you all and hopefully together we can help another artist get her hobby on track and direct it to becoming more than just a hobby! If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask me :)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><span style="""">Hi, Sam and Cayt here from <a href=""http://www.brokenglasscomic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Walking on Broken Glass</a></span><span style=""""> with our third printing project, Issue 3: <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Of Monsters and Men</span>! This comic is a labor of love from this Artist &amp; Writer duo and it is a labor we're very proud of. For the next 30 days, we're looking to you guys out there to help us realize an important part of this endeavor: printing our work. So I guess you could say, it's a labor of love from all of us, not just Cayt and I! <br/></span></p>
<p><span style="""">We've felt extremely lucky to have the fans and support we do. From day one, you've all been behind us in this and it's been so moving! So thank you so much!</span></p>
<p><span style="""">As for our comic, </span><span style=""""> <a href=""http://www.brokenglasscomic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Walking on Broken Glass</a></span><span style=""""> is a supernatural office dramedy romance about MURDER.<font size=""2""> </font></span><font size=""2""> Itâ€™s about a man dealing with a dark fate looming over his future and 
his quest to make up for the wrongs of that future in the present. Itâ€™s 
about a woman with enough strength, determination, love and stubbornness
 to stand by his side through thick and thin. Itâ€™s about monsters. Itâ€™s 
about magic. Itâ€™s about werewolves! And witches! And vampires! (Oh my?)</font></p>
<p><span style="""">Issue three deals with the mysterious incursion of monsters in the city, and the new recruit to the Wolf pack that protects it. If you like your urban fantasy with a sense of humor as <span style=""font-style: italic;"">well</span> as gravitas, you'll enjoy our comic.<br/></span></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><span style="""">When we set out to create this comic, we knew we would be putting it page by page on the web, but always intended it to be released issue by issue. The end goal for each page and each issue is to see it in print, and we love the idea of getting it to the audience in its intended format. <br/></span></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p style="""">We're going to be printing a 40-page comic via RA Comics Direct. It'll be black and white, and in addition to the material you can read on the website, there will be bonus material in the back, such as extra comics, commentary, and sketches! These will only ever be available in the print copies (and ebooks). Now to the nitty gritty! This time, the goal is $500. I'll break that down for you, as far as what the money is going to, exactly.</p>
<p style=""""><font color=""#222222""><font><font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 9pt;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">$300.11</span> for printing 100 copies of the issue<br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">$15</span> to ship books to Caytlin<br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">$150</span> to ship incentives to you guys<br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">$35</span> for IndieGoGo fees</font></font></font><br/></p>
<p style=""""><br/></p>
<p style="""">If we don't make our goal, we'll be printing fewer books -- at least enough to cover the incentives though. And if we're *really* low on donations, the books will be at a lower quality than we were otherwise planning on paying for. So we hope that we make our goal! And we're hoping it so hard that we've made some tiered incentives to unlock (as it were) if we go over the $500. More on that ... right now!</p>
<p style=""""><br/></p>
<h3>If We Make It Above $500...<br/>

</h3>Firstly, <span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">everyone who donates will get your name in the book and access to our bonus art blog.</span></span>
 At the moment there's a ten-page comic ""prequel"" that was done before 
the first page of WoBG was complete, as well as some other art. Already 
in the works to add in is a process walk-through video for drawing the 
comic, some paper dolls, and more bonus art work and stories!<p style=""""><br/></p>
<p style="""">Secondly, <span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">if you are not in the US, please add $5 to your donation to account for shipping. </span></span>Thank you so much~!</p>
<p style=""""><br/></p>
<p style="""">Lastly, if your donation tier says, ""plus your choice of one/two/all extras,"" it means that <span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">if we make it to the milestones above $500</span></span>, you can select your choice from the extra cool stuff we got to make. If we do <span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">not</span></span> make it to a milestone, this part of your incentive tier will be unavailable. Sorry! Please note that <span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">each poster design counts as its own ""extra.<span style=""font-style: italic;"">""</span></span><span style=""font-style: italic;""></span></span> Therefore, if you get the choice of ""one extra"" you may only choose one poster design.<br/></p>
<p style=""""><br/></p>

Our Story
Hi, Sam and Cayt here from Walking on Broken Glass with our third printing project, Issue 3: Of Monsters and Men! This comic is a labor of love from this Artist & Writer duo and it is a labor we're very proud of. For the next 30 days, we're looking to you guys out there to help us realize an important part of this endeavor: printing our work. So I guess you could say, it's a labor of love from all of us, not just Cayt and I! 
We've felt extremely lucky to have the fans and support we do. From day one, you've all been behind us in this and it's been so moving! So thank you so much!
As for our comic,  Walking on Broken Glass is a supernatural office dramedy romance about MURDER.  Itâ€™s about a man dealing with a dark fate looming over his future and 
his quest to make up for the wrongs of that future in the present. Itâ€™s 
about a woman with enough strength, determination, love and stubbornness
 to stand by his side through thick and thin. Itâ€™s about monsters. Itâ€™s 
about magic. Itâ€™s about werewolves! And witches! And vampires! (Oh my?)
Issue three deals with the mysterious incursion of monsters in the city, and the new recruit to the Wolf pack that protects it. If you like your urban fantasy with a sense of humor as well as gravitas, you'll enjoy our comic.


The Impact
When we set out to create this comic, we knew we would be putting it page by page on the web, but always intended it to be released issue by issue. The end goal for each page and each issue is to see it in print, and we love the idea of getting it to the audience in its intended format. 


What We Need & What You Get
We're going to be printing a 40-page comic via RA Comics Direct. It'll be black and white, and in addition to the material you can read on the website, there will be bonus material in the back, such as extra comics, commentary, and sketches! These will only ever be available in the print copies (and ebooks). Now to the nitty gritty! This time, the goal is $500. I'll break that down for you, as far as what the money is going to, exactly.
$300.11 for printing 100 copies of the issue$15 to ship books to Caytlin$150 to ship incentives to you guys$35 for IndieGoGo fees

If we don't make our goal, we'll be printing fewer books -- at least enough to cover the incentives though. And if we're *really* low on donations, the books will be at a lower quality than we were otherwise planning on paying for. So we hope that we make our goal! And we're hoping it so hard that we've made some tiered incentives to unlock (as it were) if we go over the $500. More on that ... right now!

If We Make It Above $500...
There's lots of exciting stuff in store for you!At $500, $1000, and $1500, we will release an extra page update that week instead of a Thursday sketch bonus!At $700, we can get two posters printed: At $1000, we can print t-shirts!At $1200, we can print some geeky ties!These extras are priced at these tiers to handle the additional production cost, shipping costs, and IndieGoGo fees likely to be incurred at the higher donation price. As For the Rest of the Incentives...
Firstly, everyone who donates will get your name in the book and access to our bonus art blog.
 At the moment there's a ten-page comic ""prequel"" that was done before 
the first page of WoBG was complete, as well as some other art. Already 
in the works to add in is a process walk-through video for drawing the 
comic, some paper dolls, and more bonus art work and stories!
Secondly, if you are not in the US, please add $5 to your donation to account for shipping. Thank you so much~!

Lastly, if your donation tier says, ""plus your choice of one/two/all extras,"" it means that if we make it to the milestones above $500, you can select your choice from the extra cool stuff we got to make. If we do not make it to a milestone, this part of your incentive tier will be unavailable. Sorry! Please note that each poster design counts as its own ""extra."" Therefore, if you get the choice of ""one extra"" you may only choose one poster design.

Now on to the rest of the donation incentives:
At $5, you get a copy of the ebook version. This will include, of course, not only the pages available online but the bonus material too.
At $10, you get a print copy of the book. Huzzah!
At $15, you can get an ACEO sketch card, with an inked sketch of your favorite WoBG character on it!
At $20, you get a copy of the book, in which the artist will do an inked sketch for you, along with a personalized message! Sadly, as we live far apart and can't afford to either get together or ship oodles of books back and forth, they will not be signed.
At $30, you can get all three books! You may choose one to get an inked sketch and personalized message! Plus, you get a bonus bookmark! I like exclamation points!
At $40, you get a copy of the book, a bookmark, plus you can pick some jewelry! I make a lot of jewelry, so if that tickles your fancy, this tier is for you. **Please note: some of the jewelry on that page is not available. We will have a more definite selection available for browsing when the campaign is over. Also, you get a cool dice bag! Plus, if we make it to the extras above the goal, you get to pick one!
Also at $40, you get a copy of the book, a bookmark, and access to a special, private livestreaming event where the artist will take requests and draw them while you watch! It will be three hours long, and it will have limited availability, so make sure you get in now! (Also, you get to pick one of the extra cool things we'll make, if we make it to a milestone above the goal!)
At $60, you get a copy of the book, a bookmark, and you get to commission a short story from me! These will be worked out in private when commissioned. Plus you get a choice of one extra, if we make it above the goal!
At $80, you get either your choice of 2 books or copy of a sketched & personalized issue 3, PLUS a bookmark, your choice of eight pins (we will have NEW PIN DESIGNS this time to choose from as well! Designs forthcoming!), plus a Grey Incorporated mug, plus your choice of TWO of the extras.
At $100, you get either your choice of 2 books or copy of a sketched & 
personalized issue 3, PLUS a bookmark, your choice of eight pins (we 
will have NEW PIN DESIGNS this time to choose from as well! Designs 
forthcoming!), plus an awesome dice bag, plus a Grey Incorporated mug, plus your choice of TWO of the extras.
At $150, you get a copy of issue 3, plus you get to have a cameo in a crowd scene on a page of WoBG, plus a print of that page when it's complete, plus a bookmark (plus your choice of two of the extras!).
And finally, at $500, you get pretty much everything! You get all three comics, all with inked sketches and personalized messages, plus access to the private livestream, plus one of EACH pin, plus a bookmark, plus one of each extra, plus a personalized short story and your choice of jewelry! WHEW!

<h2><b>RECAP</b></h2>Hello! Thanks again to everyone who decides to fund this
project! All pledges are greatly appreciated, no matter the level. This book
means a lot to me, and seeing it funded in any form fills my heart with
rainbows and matte black printing.<br/><p> <br/></p>
<h2><b>BOOK</b></h2>Like I said, this baby is going to be sexxy with two x’s.
I’m a bit of a print design nerd, so I’ve had a really strong vision of this
book ever since I started it. I’m combining the intricacies of Victorian style
with sharp modern design. This touches on both the visual content and thematic
content of Vixen.<br/><p> <br/></p>The comic itself is 41 pages long, and the book will have at
least a dozen pages of exclusive Vixen art and extra material—including
original character designs and never before seen illustrations.<br/><p> <br/></p>Here are the book specifications again:<br/>-56 black offset pages (70 lb matte)<br/>-12pt matte cover, ext: black offset + magenta foil press,
interior cover: magenta offset<br/><p> <br/></p>The foil press will wrap around the cover like so:<br/><br/><p></p>
<p><img align=""none"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lovetkjFoN1qhsumno1_500.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p> <br/></p>And matte covers always feels amazing, so prepare your
fingers for touching. It’ll look really hot with the foil press, so you should
probably prepare your eyes for seeing as well.<br/><p> <br/></p>
<h2><b>REWARDS</b></h2>Everyone loves rewards! And do you know what the best reward
is? MY ETERNAL LOVE.<br/><p> <br/></p>No? Well, okay. Good thing there are actual rewards then.<br/><p> <br/></p>All rewards are cumulative—so whatever level you pledge at,
you get every reward below it. (With the exception of the shipping and sketch
options, of course.)</div><div><br/></div><div><b>$80 LEVEL SKETCH CARDS:</b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><i>Please indicate which available card I have already made you would like or what character you would like me to draw in your donation.

HOME está disponible en español e inglés, y es un cómic exclusivo de esta campaña. Una vez terminada ya no podrá comprarse. 
HOME is available in english and spanish, and it's an exclusive comic for this IndieGoGo campaign. It will be not available anymore.
 
Good morning, recruits!

Our names are Raul and Oscar, and we’d like to introduce you our comic series called HOME.

All the great stories always begins with a crashed spacecraft
HOME is a futuristic Sci-Fi Comic Miniseries about a military rescue spacecraft crashed in an impossible planet. Trapped there, the stranded crew of Space Marines must fight against the first extra-terrestrial life form discovered by humans: a brutal and vicious alien species. But there they will discover something else: a huge mystery that puts in risk the survival of all life in the galaxy. 

Who watch the watchers?
But actually, this is a story about characters. They are space marines, medical, scientists, but men and women in the end that need to trust in one another to survive. A hard duty, as they are all hiding many dark secrets. 


Welcome to the future, a vast dark place
So this is a Sci-Fi story, but it is about revenge and forgiveness, regret and honor, anger and love, and of course, the discovery of the secrets of the universe. These are the elements that form an intricate puzzle between the past of the characters and the future of the human kind. 

The castaways
HOME is a classic Sci-Fi inspired adventure recommended for grownups, looking like a Hollywood movie mixing Blade Runner, 2001 and the Alien trilogy, and with a narrative style inspired by some of the best Sci-fi-drama TV series like Battlestar Galactica, Firefly or Lost.

<h3><em style=""font-size: 1.17em;""><strong>Please click on the image of Pitch Book Cover above to explore the Interactive Pitch Book for The Misguided Adventures of Cadiman!!!</strong></em></h3>
<h3><strong>In 2008, Kevin Amodia, the creator of Meltin' Pot Productions began the creation of his dream and in 2013 he is ready to share it with the world on a whole other level...</strong></h3>
<h2>About the cartoon:</h2>
<p>The Misguided Adventures of Cadiman i<span>s the first ""Almost Reality Animated Series""</span> developed by Kevin Amodia as a way to showcase the music, comedy, acting, and talents of fellow East Bay, California artists that are trying to make a name for themselves. It<span> is an animated comedy, following the misadventures of a cape sporting, urban entrepreneur </span><span>who solves mysteries with the help of his often eccentric and loose lipped friends.</span></p>
<p>Starring the comedy stylings of Stephen ""Smiddy"" Smithey, ToneWeez (Tony Patten), Schol@r (Kevin Amodia), Ron Tate &amp; voices from Jesus Garcia and Dennis Hazleton, Cadiman is a cartoon about a day with your closest friends making jokes about each other and each others moms with a dose of adventure in every episode.  Cadiman has a way of dropping an extremely subtle, yet very apparent message, camouflaged by gratuitous dirty jokes,  hip hop references, ethnic and gender slashes that are sure to have you rolling and/or appalled. Either way you will totally LOVE it!</p>
<p>On the next page you can watch the edited version of our PILOT episode, Never2old.com!</p>
<h2>The Next Step...</h2>
<p>Kevin has spent hours upon hours creating this cartoon from scratch. He is the illustrator, the writer, the editor, the animator, and the producer of this whole production. It is his goal to make his dream come true and bring along all of his closest friends with him. </p>
<p>In order to do this...we need your help.  We are planning to pitch this series to as many tv networks as we can. (HBO, Comedy Central, AdultSwim, etc.) We have created a proper Pitch Book for the networks and an Online Interactive Document. However there are a few other things that we need your help and support in putting together and below or just a few examples of some of the things we need to accomplish.</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to find a Literary agent.</li>
<li>We need to print out copies of the Pitch Book and put together a supreme presenation that won't be forgotten.</li>
<li>We need to develop a toy or other merchandise that will show that the cartoon is marketable.</li>
</ul><p>By Aug 1, we plan to be residents of Los Angeles and really go for it all...</p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">This is where you come in...  :)</strong></p>
<p>So many of you have helped in so many ways by sharing episodes, helping us get likes and support on Youtube and Facebook and we appreciate it all. Every little thing helps us get exposure and get more fans. </p>
<p>We are asking for our family, friends, fans and potential investors to come together and help us with this one last step.  Any donation is greatly appreciated.  Even if it is $1.00, that is $1.00 closer to making Kevins dream come true. His talent, dedication, and motivation are meant to be seen.  </p>
<p>Help be a part of this incredible journey and see Cadiman on a primetime slot sooner rather than later! Please donate today!</p>

<h3> </h3></div>","Please click on the image of Pitch Book Cover above to explore the Interactive Pitch Book for The Misguided Adventures of Cadiman!!!
In 2008, Kevin Amodia, the creator of Meltin' Pot Productions began the creation of his dream and in 2013 he is ready to share it with the world on a whole other level...
About the cartoon:
The Misguided Adventures of Cadiman is the first ""Almost Reality Animated Series"" developed by Kevin Amodia as a way to showcase the music, comedy, acting, and talents of fellow East Bay, California artists that are trying to make a name for themselves. It is an animated comedy, following the misadventures of a cape sporting, urban entrepreneur who solves mysteries with the help of his often eccentric and loose lipped friends.
Starring the comedy stylings of Stephen ""Smiddy"" Smithey, ToneWeez (Tony Patten), Schol@r (Kevin Amodia), Ron Tate & voices from Jesus Garcia and Dennis Hazleton, Cadiman is a cartoon about a day with your closest friends making jokes about each other and each others moms with a dose of adventure in every episode.  Cadiman has a way of dropping an extremely subtle, yet very apparent message, camouflaged by gratuitous dirty jokes,  hip hop references, ethnic and gender slashes that are sure to have you rolling and/or appalled. Either way you will totally LOVE it!
On the next page you can watch the edited version of our PILOT episode, Never2old.com!
The Next Step...
Kevin has spent hours upon hours creating this cartoon from scratch. He is the illustrator, the writer, the editor, the animator, and the producer of this whole production. It is his goal to make his dream come true and bring along all of his closest friends with him. 
In order to do this...we need your help.  We are planning to pitch this series to as many tv networks as we can. (HBO, Comedy Central, AdultSwim, etc.) We have created a proper Pitch Book for the networks and an Online Interactive Document. However there are a few other things that we need your help and support in putting together and below or just a few examples of some of the things we need to accomplish.

We need to find a Literary agent.
We need to print out copies of the Pitch Book and put together a supreme presenation that won't be forgotten.
We need to develop a toy or other merchandise that will show that the cartoon is marketable.
By Aug 1, we plan to be residents of Los Angeles and really go for it all...
This is where you come in...  :)
So many of you have helped in so many ways by sharing episodes, helping us get likes and support on Youtube and Facebook and we appreciate it all. Every little thing helps us get exposure and get more fans. 
We are asking for our family, friends, fans and potential investors to come together and help us with this one last step.  Any donation is greatly appreciated.  Even if it is $1.00, that is $1.00 closer to making Kevins dream come true. His talent, dedication, and motivation are meant to be seen.  
Help be a part of this incredible journey and see Cadiman on a primetime slot sooner rather than later! Please donate today!
 
Warmest regards,
The Cadiman Crew & Meltin' Pot Productions

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Hannah grows up in the American Midwest, and one day while exploring with her trusty dog Mojo she comes across a secret government lab.

<p>Hannah and Mojo become half human and half data.</p>
<p>The eGirl story is a coming of age story in a technology driven world. It is full of excitement, death, action, heartbreak, passion, vigilence, truth, drama and of course love!</p>
<p>eGirl grows up to be the toughest and most ruthless fighter of cybercrime and the 1st Superhero of the internet. Follow her and her trusty sidekick Megabite through their battles in Cyberspace and around the world.</p>
<p>Through an interesting turn of events a bizarre situation will eventually put her in a position where she can save the world.</p>

You can help propagate new ideas and unique stories that are not necessarily commercial blockbusters like the typical super hero comics are, but are all the more important for that very same reason.  </p>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you'd like to help, but have no funds at hand to do so, please share this page to all your social media.

<ul> </ul> </div> <p>Thank you!!! :)</p></div>","Hi, my name is Kris, and I'm in the middle of creating an awesome horror-fantasy comic. Imagine the anime ""Berserk"" mixed with ""The Walking Dead"" comic. It's deep. It's dark. It's graphically violent. It starts off pre-zombie apocalypse and then builds up to the dead rising and the living falling.



I have approximately 11 pages of the 22 needed for completion already done. I've been working on this with an illustrator for about 2 months now, and he needs 8 more weeks to finish illustrating. 
My goal here is to raise money for a printing of 1,000 copies of this comic to distribute to you guys, and to comic stores in the region. I'm doing this to try to build a fan-base or readership of my work. 



Besides being just awesome for it's artwork and story, I think my comic has social value because I have characters from all across the LGBTQ spectrum fully represented in my work in non-stereotypical ways.



I also have the first mentally challenged special needs character in a comic book. I focus on his heroic life and heroic actions. I'm writing him from my personal experiences with my mentally challenged special needs friends. 




Check out the gallery for more bits about the story with each piece of art!
Or check out my successful Kickstarter Campaign:



    What We Need & What You Get We need $2,250 for this printing. This includes the Indiegogo and payment processing fees, and shipping. All money raised is going towards this print.
If we don't reach our goal here, the money will go towards a smaller print run. 
In return, you will get the digital copy emailed to you when it is completed by September 2016, and at least one physical copy mailed to you (signed or unsigned up to you) by October 2016.

Pictured above is the line-art for ""Sorengaard"". See him fully colored in the gallery section. 




Pictured above is a Gottlieb shirt. Check the pledge tiers to get yours!

Above is the front side of both the Sorengaard and Gottlieb shirts. A third graphic will be released in a couple of days!! 
  Your Impact Without your support, cool indie horror-fantasy comics like this one won't ever be produced, printed and shipped to stores for others to see and discover. You can help propagate new ideas and unique stories that are not necessarily commercial blockbusters like the typical super hero comics are, but are all the more important for that very same reason.  



    Risks & Challenges My illustrator and I are working very closely and well together. I have funding for the completion of issue 1 of this comic. The only complication might be in printing, where the printer has unforeseen delays.
    Other Ways You Can Help If you'd like to help, but have no funds at hand to do so, please share this page to all your social media. Share it with friends and family that you think might want to donate, and give them a reason as to why you think they should. Nothing beats a personal message from a friend!

<p></p><p>Hello! My name is Solomon Lim (aka <a href=""http://splgum.deviantart.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Splgum</a>), and I have been working together with my artist Wai Hoong Chong (aka <a href=""http://stryler.deviantart.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Stryler</a>) since 2012 on a comic series titled <i>Alphario: The World Connection</i>.</p>
<p><i>Alphario</i> has been steadily gaining popularity in the Philippines, appearing in multiple television segments and receiving several awards within the past 2 years. Today, the entire lineup of <i>Alphario</i> products include 10 comic books, 2 plushies, assorted button badges, and multiple photo prints—with many more planned in the succeeding months.</p>

<br/>
<p>What people do not know is that <i>Alphario</i> is commissioned work, and approximately 70% of my monthly income goes into funding the project. I have to admit that there were times that I went negative, but the thought of seeing readers smile and excitedly flip through the pages of a new book always makes me feel that the sacrifice was worth it. Unfortunately, it has come to the point that I need to save for the future. With much hesitation, I considered reducing our number of upcoming book releases and going into an indefinite hiatus... until some friends introduced me to a crowdfunding site called Indiegogo.</p>
<p>So here I am today, and with your help, we can make things happen! But first off...</p>
<br/>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452785155/r8aiu7l51bjzr5nptoqf.png"" src="""" style=""width: 253px;height: 23px;""/></p>
<p>Imagine winning an all-expense paid trip to the country of your dreams, complete with matching VIP treatment and a private villa for the entire duration of your stay. <i>Life couldn't be any more perfect,</i> you say to yourself. Being the thrill seeker that you are, you decide to go out and explore the nearby woods instead of staying in the confines of your luxury home. You were warned, however, that the place is infested with monsters. You shrug it off. Rumors are rumors unless there are pictures to prove it after all.</p>
<p>Enter the life of 20-year-old photographer Dennis Blake, and welcome to the story of <i>Alphario: The World Connection</i>.</p>
<p><i>Alphario</i> is an action-adventure series that started as a prank back in 2004, developed into a novel in 2009, and evolved into a comic series in 2011. The story is a well blended mix of genres: from light-hearted ones like comedy and fantasy to much darker subjects like conspiracy and betrayal. Unlike the usual fantasy series, <i>Alphario</i> is unique with its unexpected plot twists. Imagine going through the hero's journey, following his/her steps in an adventure of a lifetime... only to later on discover that he/she is not the good guy we imagined him/her to be.</p>
<p>Last August 2010, <i>Alphario</i> held its first drawing contest in DeviantArt with the theme being <i>prologue</i>. The contest was unexpectedly successful, gathering 190 entries in less than 3 months. In April last year, memories of the contest inspired us to create <i>Alphario Vol. 0</i>, revealing the actual events that led to Dennis' good fortune. We believe in innovation, and in an attempt to make the comic better, we considered several options: experimenting on a new shading style, occasionally adjusting the price of the comic, and figuring out which combination appeals best to the public. <i>Alphario Vol. 0</i> turned out to be a great success; however, we knew deep inside that we could do better. Much, much better.</p>

<p>Not at all! In fact, the our $2500 goal is so little and exact that there is only very little to no room for errors on our end. Have a look at our breakdown of expenses:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Drawing <small>(48% - $1200)</small></b></li>
<p>Drawing costs are expensive, taking up the bulk of funds for the campaign. The comic is going to be in full color, and Stryler's asking price is $50 per page. This brings the cost up to $1200 if we do 24 pages.</p>
<p>I have been working with Stryler for a long time now and have seen the wonders of his coloring. With his skills and my stringent perfectionism (trust me, it's not as bad as it sounds), there is no doubt that the <i>Alphario: The World Before α</i> will not only be a comic but also a beautiful work of art once it is complete.</p>
<li><b>Publishing <small>(42% - $1050)</small></b></li>
<p><i>Alphario: The World Before α</i> will have A5 (210mm x 148.5mm) dimensions and 24 pages. The cover will have a special foil stamping and the inside pages will have the same premium and glossy feel you find in the best artbooks.

</p>
<p>I have been working with a specific local printing company since <i>Alphario Vol. 1</i>, and am confident about the quality of prints that they can produce. For the fully colored <i>Alphario: The World Before α</i>, the printing company is requiring a minimum of 500 copies at $850 for 20 pages (+$200 for every additional 4 pages). Doing the math, that's $1050 if the comic ends up with 24 pages.</p>
<li><b>Miscellaneous <small>(10% - $250)</small></b></li>
<p>You may think: drawing and publishing costs couldn't be the only expenses for the project, and you're perfectly right. While $250 wouldn't be enough to cover our food and electricity bills, it should be enough to provide for supporter giveaways including our special backer-exclusive wallpaper, prints, and other extras. The more you help us achieve, the more you will receive!</p>

<ul>
<li><b>$3000 - 4 More Pages (REACHED)</b></li>
<p>Many of the events of <i>Alphario</i> actually happen before the main storyline, and because the <i>Alphario: The World Before α</i> tells the prologue of the series, it is easy expand the comic to reveal important tidbits that we have long kept hidden from the public. Help us reach $3000 and we'll add 4 pages to the book, as well as several elements of mystery that will keep your minds actively thinking!</p>
<li><b>$4300 - Eurid Plushies</b></li>
<p>We have so many big plans for this year, and one of them is to release our third <i>Alphario</i> plushie. If we reach $4300, we will have enough money to have our Eurid Plushies manufactured.

Hello! My name is Solomon Lim (aka Splgum), and I have been working together with my artist Wai Hoong Chong (aka Stryler) since 2012 on a comic series titled Alphario: The World Connection.
Alphario has been steadily gaining popularity in the Philippines, appearing in multiple television segments and receiving several awards within the past 2 years. Today, the entire lineup of Alphario products include 10 comic books, 2 plushies, assorted button badges, and multiple photo prints—with many more planned in the succeeding months.




What people do not know is that Alphario is commissioned work, and approximately 70% of my monthly income goes into funding the project. I have to admit that there were times that I went negative, but the thought of seeing readers smile and excitedly flip through the pages of a new book always makes me feel that the sacrifice was worth it. Unfortunately, it has come to the point that I need to save for the future. With much hesitation, I considered reducing our number of upcoming book releases and going into an indefinite hiatus... until some friends introduced me to a crowdfunding site called Indiegogo.
So here I am today, and with your help, we can make things happen! But first off...


Imagine winning an all-expense paid trip to the country of your dreams, complete with matching VIP treatment and a private villa for the entire duration of your stay. Life couldn't be any more perfect, you say to yourself. Being the thrill seeker that you are, you decide to go out and explore the nearby woods instead of staying in the confines of your luxury home. You were warned, however, that the place is infested with monsters. You shrug it off. Rumors are rumors unless there are pictures to prove it after all.
Enter the life of 20-year-old photographer Dennis Blake, and welcome to the story of Alphario: The World Connection.
Alphario is an action-adventure series that started as a prank back in 2004, developed into a novel in 2009, and evolved into a comic series in 2011. The story is a well blended mix of genres: from light-hearted ones like comedy and fantasy to much darker subjects like conspiracy and betrayal. Unlike the usual fantasy series, Alphario is unique with its unexpected plot twists. Imagine going through the hero's journey, following his/her steps in an adventure of a lifetime... only to later on discover that he/she is not the good guy we imagined him/her to be.
Last August 2010, Alphario held its first drawing contest in DeviantArt with the theme being prologue. The contest was unexpectedly successful, gathering 190 entries in less than 3 months. In April last year, memories of the contest inspired us to create Alphario Vol. 0, revealing the actual events that led to Dennis' good fortune. We believe in innovation, and in an attempt to make the comic better, we considered several options: experimenting on a new shading style, occasionally adjusting the price of the comic, and figuring out which combination appeals best to the public. Alphario Vol. 0 turned out to be a great success; however, we knew deep inside that we could do better. Much, much better.
With that said, it's time to tell you about our Indiegogo campaign.


We are remaking Alphario Vol. 0, with a target release date of November 19, 2016.
When we say remake, we mean starting with clean slate. While the overall idea of the original Alphario Vol. 0 will still live on, we will be replacing everything else. To make things extra special for our supporters, we are making the remake in full color. Every panel will be a finished illustration, complete with backgrounds drawn with incredible detail.
Below are the first two pages (with dialogues omitted) from the original comic. We took a panel and splashed it with color to give you a rough idea as to what art style we are going to use in the remake.

If you already like the preview as is, imagine how much more you'll enjoy the Alphario: The World Before α once it is in complete!
Also, we figured that it might be helpful for you to know about this:

And that's about it! To conclude, here is our vision statement for this campaign:

<p>Argonaut takes place in Kansas City in the year 2242. Twenty-five years prior to the series, earth was in a devastating war with another planet and its military force the Argon Empire. This was known as the Earth-Argon conflict.</p>
<p>After the war, technology from the Argon Empire advanced earth significantly. Crime is at an all-time high, corrupt corporations run the world, and police are unable to deal with the level of criminals, so they contract bounty hunters.</p>
<p>The main character is Jason Madsen a bounty hunter. What makes him different from other bounty hunters you may ask? Well, he was trained from birth by a shadowy organization to be a killing machine. He escaped from the organization as a kid and was raised by an Earth-Argon veteran named Jack Chapel.</p>
<p>Jason is tracked down by the shadowy organization to capture a rogue soldier named Erik. With his mentor, the sarcastic AI in his spaceship, a former Yakuza member, and a cyborg space marine, the crew of Argonaut work to capture the rogue soldier.</p>

SOS Vol. 1 is an 80 page graphic novel written by me and art by Ibai Canales of successful Indiegogo campaigns such as Iron Sights, the Abductables, and Necromancer! This volume contains issues #1-4 of a multi-issue story line!
SOS is a comedy/action series that chronicles the misadventures of three brothers who were former super soldiers for the US Government during WWII. SOS find themselves coming out of retirement after demons invade earth from their home dimension called the Abyss, led by their brutal Demon King.
The brothers set up a monster hunting business in Brooklyn, New York as they work to stop the demonic invasion and make a profit from it at the same time. The three brothers are all New York has against the demonic invasion.
Combining bad ass action scenes with surreal and dark humor, SOS is a comic that will impress you and make you laugh at the same time.

STRETCH GOALS

$5,000 – Add 8 pages of story to SOS Vol. 1 
$7,500 - All physical backers will receive a copy of Argonaut #1
$8,000 - Extend Argonaut #1 to 26 pages
$12,000 - Every backer will receive a 21 page digital preview of my next book SOS: Onslaught
ARGONAUT
I am also offering a 22 page cyberpunk comic called Argonaut as a stretch goal. It is the first issue in a six issue mini-series I hope to produce.
Written by Chimera
Drawn by Rafael C.
Colored by Irina Krieger
Lettering by Eric Weathers
Cover by Caanan White
Argonaut takes place in Kansas City in the year 2242. Twenty-five years prior to the series, earth was in a devastating war with another planet and its military force the Argon Empire. This was known as the Earth-Argon conflict.
After the war, technology from the Argon Empire advanced earth significantly. Crime is at an all-time high, corrupt corporations run the world, and police are unable to deal with the level of criminals, so they contract bounty hunters.
The main character is Jason Madsen a bounty hunter. What makes him different from other bounty hunters you may ask? Well, he was trained from birth by a shadowy organization to be a killing machine. He escaped from the organization as a kid and was raised by an Earth-Argon veteran named Jack Chapel.
Jason is tracked down by the shadowy organization to capture a rogue soldier named Erik. With his mentor, the sarcastic AI in his spaceship, a former Yakuza member, and a cyborg space marine, the crew of Argonaut work to capture the rogue soldier.

Risks & ChallengesThis would be my first rodeo when it comes to crowdfunding. With a small crowdfunding goal, there's high probability this campaign will be funded and you will receive this awesome book! The goal is also flexible so whatever funds we have the backers will receive the comic regardless.

This autumn he will be appearing in final series of 'The Fall' with Gillian Anderson and Jamie Dornan.</p>

Hello,

And welcome to my indiegogo Campaign Fund. For those of you who don't  already know me I'm Victoria Jeffrey - an actress, producer, comedienne and I'm bringing my brand new one woman show to the Edinburgh Festival. 

As an actress I've worked extensively in all facets of the industry and I've had a varied career ranging from playing Gertrude in Hamlet in front of 1000 people in Copenhagen, to performing in the West End and appearing at the famous Comedy Store in London as one half of the award winning female comedy double act 'The Totally Naff Tarts'.

This autumn he will be appearing in final series of 'The Fall' with Gillian Anderson and Jamie Dornan.
I've appeared in many productions at the Festival before, as well as the aforementioned Totally Naff Tarts alongside the wonderful Janet Spike Fullerlove. The critically acclaimed sell out run was a  'Guardian’s Critics Choice' and this year I'm really excited to be going solo for the first time.

What is Dancing With Jack about? …


The show is a funny, sassy, bittersweet poignant look at life.


A tale about love, loss and everything in between ... Oh and then there's Jack ... Who is Jack? … Where is Jack? ... It's hard to go into too much detail about the show without giving the plot away. Suffice to say that there is a Jack for everyone and everyone has a Jack in their lives.
'Dancing with Jack' is based on an original idea I had a few years ago. It combines storytelling, stand up, improv and music.  It was put on hold for a number of years, but now I'm raring to go.  ... So this is where you come in.

What I need and some lovely incentives ...




So, what do you get for your buck? I'm trying to raise at least £5,000 to cover the costs of Edinburgh.


I have lots of lovely perks! … Well ok … Bribes to reward you with depending on how much you would like to contribute. This includes a virtual hug, to a 'I Danced With Jack T-Shirt' to tickets for the Edinburgh or London Shows with a glass of something bubbly with me afterwards. And maybe Jack as well … But I can't guarantee that … Because Jack is … Well he's just Jack ...

It really is a very special venue at the heart of the fringe.


Future plans for the production 


I am really excited about heading to New York in the Autumn where I have been invited to perform 'Dancing With Jack'.  There are plans for a London run followed by a tour in the New Year.  


Thank you! … 

Your support means everything to me. xx                                                                     


Any contribution large or small could make the all the difference in helping me bring 'Dancing With Jack' to a wonderful eclectic international audience that visit the Edinburgh Festival.  But the costs are much more than I can manage to raise alone. So thank you, thank you, thank you one and all for those of you who will take the time to support myself and Jack. It really does mean the world to me x

<p>Hi! My name is Mike,and i live in Athens,Greece.</p>

<h2><strong>About the Comic</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Sugar Coated Damage</strong> is an ever twisting abstract story,that dives deep into thoughts and comes back to the surface with an uncertain confidence that being damaged or causing damage in any way, may or may not be nicely awful. It is more or less a psychedelic chain of events that transform and fuse together without any good reason.</p>

<p>It was fully drawn by hand,using a calligraphy brush and sumi ink,spontaneously capturing the abstract flow of the story,as i didn't use any planning sketches.</p>

I am a painter,tattooer and ink illustrator and usually go under the nickname ''Never Brush My Teeth''.
Sugar Coated Damage is the first comic book i aspire to publish, after a series of illustrated zines i have made the previous years. As a fan of zines and self publishing,i found the idea of crowdfunding suitable for this project and decided to give it a shot :)

About the Comic
 
Sugar Coated Damage is an ever twisting abstract story,that dives deep into thoughts and comes back to the surface with an uncertain confidence that being damaged or causing damage in any way, may or may not be nicely awful. It is more or less a psychedelic chain of events that transform and fuse together without any good reason.
 

 
It was fully drawn by hand,using a calligraphy brush and sumi ink,spontaneously capturing the abstract flow of the story,as i didn't use any planning sketches.
The whole book is black and white and silent (does not contain dialogue boxes).
Measures approximately 18 x 25,5 cm and is 52 pages long.
This project is entirely personal and of a ''DIY'' nature.When the campaign is completed,the edition will be printed by me using our risograph machine here at Sleep On It Press studio and will then be bound and shipped to you,along with the perks :)

Hi my name is Barry Duffield, I'm an actor and some of you may know me as Lugo on Spartacus: Vengeance and the up coming season: War of the Damned. What you may not know is that I am also an optioned screenwriter. 
My dream is to bring my script 'Dead Man's Land' to life in full glorious colour and eventually, via the Graphic Novel, get it onto a big screen near you.
The Walking Dead & Hell Boy are a couple of successful examples of Graphic Novels that have made it to TV and the big screen - There are many more. 
Graphic Novels are a great way for producers to visualize a story rather than just reading it on the page.
Logline:
""A squad of WW2 Paratroopers, shot down behind enemy lines, are forced to stand against a pack of genetically created Nazi Werewolves before they can wreak havoc amongst the approaching Allied forces.""

I need $35,000 to realise the dream of bringing this story to life and ultimately bringing it to the stores for you. This will pay for the...

--STEVE STERN, creator of Zen Intergalactic Ninja and author of the BEOWULF, A CHRISTMAS CAROL and WAR OF THE WORLDS Graphic Novels
""There’s never been a World War II story quite like DEAD MAN’S LAND.  What could be cooler than a bunch of courageous paratroopers in bloody combat with  a pack of genetically-altered Nazi werewolves, with the outcome of the War in the balance?  This is going to make a great graphic novel, and one hell of a film!""

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Eowyn, our illustrator for Pitchblende, was diagnosed this year with a medical condition that effects her mobility and movement. We've explored several options, and have decided that the most practical way to allow Eowyn to draw in various positions and maximize efficiency is to buy a Wacom Cintiq 13HD Tablet. This is a tablet that will allow Eowyn to draw directly onto the screen with a special pen, streamlining the illustration process. Unlike traditional drawing on paper, Eowyn will not need to be hunched over a desk for hours on end, but instead will be able to move from chair to table to bed to standing, etc. This tablet is also unique in that the control and capabilities of the drawing itself is as close to drawing on physical paper that we've found. This is necessary for the organic 19th and early-20th Century look we're going for with Pitchblende.</span><br/></p>

<p>My name is Scott A. Ford, artist, designer, and storyteller from Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. I am the writer and illustrator behind the new graphic series, <em>Romulus + Remus</em>. </p>
<p><em>Romulus + Remus</em> is entirely independent. I do all the writing and all the art, but I also do all the layout and design, advertising, marketing, and event coordination.</p>
<h2><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://scottaford.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/header-neon.jpg?w=1024"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Romulus + Remus""/></h2>
<h2>The Campaign</h2>
<p><em>Romulus + Remus</em> is an action/horror comic set in the present day and inspired by Ancient Roman Society and Religion. The first instalment of <em>Romulus + Remus</em>, <em>A Watcher in the Depths</em>, is divided into two Issues. Issue 1 was released last April as a small first edition. Issue 2 will be complete by the end of April and I plan to release it in early June. This Indiegogo campaign will help fund the release of Issue 2 as well as a reprint of Issue 1, which is nearly sold out.</p>
<p><em>My campaign goal of $4500 will help fund:</em></p>
<p> - Printing of Issue 2 and reprint of Issue 1</p>
<p> - Advertising and promotion</p>
<p> - Additional merchandise</p>
<p> - Special events</p>
<h2>Plot &amp; Themes</h2>
<p><span><em>Romulus + Remus</em> <span>follows the life of Roman, 'The Concrete Angel'. </span></span><span>Dropped onto this Earth off the coast of Italy, he seeks to break free of the past that tries to control him. Roman’s struggle to define his own personal crusade proves to be a battle more internal than against the worlds around him.</span></p>
<p>Under the surface, the series explores concepts of duality: hero and villain, mythology and religion, old-world and modernity, but more importantly the threshold between these sides. Where do the poles reverse and one becomes the other? When do the boundaries disappear and lies therein the void between?</p>

ერთად გავაცოცხლოთ უძველესი ქართული ლეგენდა ამირანზე! 
""Amirani"" graphic novel trilogy is in Kartvelian and in English languages. The first 100 contributors who`ll get 25$ & more perks, will get 2nd part of the trilogy for free in December, 2014! 

I`m Nikoloz Khomasuridze, Kartvelian Film DIrector/Producer and a creator of Lost Legends. I like History, Legends & Myths and after graduating from The Los Angeles Film School, I decided to become a filmmaker who`ll make alive an unique culture hidden and lost in historical events, antic legends & myths of my homeland SAKARTVELO!
The Legend about Kartvelian hero Amirani is around 5000 years old and there isn`t any good illustrated book published about him yet. Our campaign is our first try to use Indiegogo Platform to receive contributions and support from very kind heart people and it`s very important to reach our goal on our very first try. Our dream is to publish and introduce to the world this mystic legend and new heroes with our high quality graphic novel book, which is in Kartvelian and in English languages and it will be published in July 27th, 2014.  ""Amirani (Kartvelian: ამირანი) is the name of a Kartvelian Epic Culture hero  who`s story was used for the Classical Prometheus. The legend itself is from 3,000  years BC, at the beginning of the first Iron Age. Amirani  (godchild of God) and his brothers Usupi & Badri reunite people and Godsons to fight against army of dark powers leading by undefeated CloudKing and his general Kaji Rokapi"". Our final goal with this first graphic novel is to create a company which will develop unique mythology story from Sakartvelo and Caucasian region into drawings and then based on them make great scripts and Hollywood quality big budget Films and Animations. What We Need & What You Get

We would be so delighted to reach our goal and get the entire budget. What we need is to finish our project and make alive the oldest Kartvelian Legends & Myths and Heroes of these stories.  We already made half of drawings and we share the Promo video with you. We hope you already enjoyed watching it. 


This amount includes Publishing of the Book and all other expenses: taxes and fees for the project, to make and provide books, Thank You-Posters and T-shirts for our Indiegogo campaign supporters. We need this amount of money to make a high level and quality graphic novel and also make all of you happy with our perks. 


Our creative team will try to do our best to make these perks more unique and make you even more excited and surprised when you get the  items of our Graphic Novel, so you`ll be proud to be a part of this great journey through the history of the ""Lost Legends: Amirani & Brothers!""

Moros is a vigilante who's real name is Edward Knight.  He is a detective in a corrupt city who decides to take the law into his own hands.  Moros uses any means necessary to rid his city of evil, even if his methods lack morality.


Who's the team behind Moros??


My name is Joshua Lucas and Moros is a passion project of mine.  I wrote this story two years ago, after facing many personal struggles.  The story is dark, reflective, and visceral.  

I think, in a world where comics have become watered down, Moros will stand out as something full of depth.  Every issue is a crazy ride, and the tale of Edward's first year of being Moros (which takes place over 12 issues) is simply EPIC!!
In the course of two years I have been through five different illustrators.  I have also attempted to do the art myself.  All of these efforts, though at times frustrating, have brought me to work with the brilliant Tamal Saha.

Moros looks great!!  Who is the artist??

Tamal Saha, an illustrator and comic lover working out of India, is the amazing talent that brings Moros to life.  I met Tamal online and together we worked a half a world apart to complete  Moros: A Hard Boiled Hero issue one.

So, who are we really?

Plainly put, we are just two guys who love comics.  We haven't worked on anything you would know, though both of us have been working on our craft for years.  I feel like we've created something special, something that I am proud of and something that I believe people will truly enjoy.  If you like what you see in our video and Facebook, then I urge you to help however you can.  
   How are you going to use the cash, and what goodies are you offering???
 We are trying to raise $1,000 United States Dollars, and here is what it will be used for: 
The illustration of issue two.  Issue one is done and payed for, but I need to raise some money in order to pay Tamal for his time and talents.  He is absolutely worth every penny!! ISBN number for digital and print publishing and distribution.  It costs money to get these!! A soft printing of the first issue.  200-500 copies, which will cost a couple of hundred, depending on where we print. 

We have several goodies that will give a contributor a sense of exclusivity and their name in the Moros archives forever!  They are as follows:


A thank you and the supporter's name printed in the back of Moros: A Hard Boiled Hero issue one!!

An exclusive variant cover that will only be available through pledging to this campaign.  This cover was done by an American artist, Kirk Feretzanis.

Special addition versions of the first issue.  These issues include a copy of the script and sketches done along the two year journey to the book being finished.
Signed copies of both the regular and special edition of the comic!!
Signed original art work paired with a signed bracketed script.  A nice combo with original artwork signed by THE Moros illustrator, Tamal Saha, and a script signed by me, Joshua Lucas.



  Why Moros?
 Helping Moros continue his journey is important.  It means supporting indie art, creator owned comics, and small business.

Moros has no agenda and tries to make no over all points (it's just a good story), but there are certain people who may find a special connection to the work.  They would be: 
Anyone who has dealt with addiction, either personally or by way of family or close friends.  Moros develops chemical dependency issues that are central to his character and his struggles. Members of the Military.  Our protagonist is ex-military and he suffers from PTSD, and has difficulty adjusting to a civilian world.  This is a book that Military people will relate to. Bohemian artist/writers.  Moros is a VERY risky, mature book.  It's extremely dark, with depth.  I think anyone who likes bloody, strange, and horrific entertainment will be right at home with this comic!!


  A Tree in the Forest..

In truth, we are one of many great indie comic books out there.

Today's world is full of great entertainment in massive quantities.  It is easy for good work to go unnoticed and word of mouth is still the best advertising.  EVEN IF YOU CAN'T GIVE US A DIME, if you like what you see, share it!  Tell others about Moros!  Retweet us!  Like our Facebook!  The readership for any indie book is more of a family than a fan base.  We need YOUR help!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Who are we?</span><br/>
</h3>
<div>We are OTP Manga. A group of writers, artists, voice actors, sound designers, and general anime and manga nerds who have come together to create new original manga series in a unique and exciting way.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<ul> <li>How many series do you have right now, when I only see one?</li>
</ul>
<div>We currently have 9 series in varied stages of production. Infinity's Light is the only series in post production for the first chapter and production for the next 3 chapters.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<ul><li>Why do you need to have an indiegogo goal of $25,000 for a manga project?</li></ul>
<div>First, if it were just one manga series it would be a lot lower, but with 9 series all needing the same programs, equipment, and personnel it becomes a lot more costly. In addition, we need to hire on more people to help out with all of the series. Artist's assistants and lead artists for other series need to be hired on as well, and we can't afford to bring them on with what we have right now. In addition to artists there are voice actors, manga editors, and equipment that need to be added to make the series even better than what we're capable of making right now. Keep in mind that this is still less than the budget for a full anime episode. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<ul><li>How much is it going to cost me to read/watch the newest chapters of a series when they come out?</li></ul>
<div>That's the really cool part. Nothing at all, we want you to check out each series the same way you would watch a video on YouTube or read comic strip online.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<ul><li>So how are you going to make your money if it's free online? </li></ul>
<div>While reading it is free, we will be making money from YouTube views, and website attention, but that will only get us so far. Since OTP Manga owns all of the content we can make money through merch, the OSTs for each series on iTunes or your favorite place to get music, as well as through our outtakes. Also, we understand that you may not like every series that OTP Manga puts out, everyone has their preferences and favorites. So each series will be getting it's own patreon so that fans can help contribute to it and help the creators keep going.</div>
<div><br/></div>

</ul>
</div></div>","Who are we?

We are OTP Manga. A group of writers, artists, voice actors, sound designers, and general anime and manga nerds who have come together to create new original manga series in a unique and exciting way.

 How many series do you have right now, when I only see one?

We currently have 9 series in varied stages of production. Infinity's Light is the only series in post production for the first chapter and production for the next 3 chapters.

Why do you need to have an indiegogo goal of $25,000 for a manga project?
First, if it were just one manga series it would be a lot lower, but with 9 series all needing the same programs, equipment, and personnel it becomes a lot more costly. In addition, we need to hire on more people to help out with all of the series. Artist's assistants and lead artists for other series need to be hired on as well, and we can't afford to bring them on with what we have right now. In addition to artists there are voice actors, manga editors, and equipment that need to be added to make the series even better than what we're capable of making right now. Keep in mind that this is still less than the budget for a full anime episode. 

How much is it going to cost me to read/watch the newest chapters of a series when they come out?
That's the really cool part. Nothing at all, we want you to check out each series the same way you would watch a video on YouTube or read comic strip online.

So how are you going to make your money if it's free online? 
While reading it is free, we will be making money from YouTube views, and website attention, but that will only get us so far. Since OTP Manga owns all of the content we can make money through merch, the OSTs for each series on iTunes or your favorite place to get music, as well as through our outtakes. Also, we understand that you may not like every series that OTP Manga puts out, everyone has their preferences and favorites. So each series will be getting it's own patreon so that fans can help contribute to it and help the creators keep going.

 Why is this such a big deal to you?

Not only does this help us greatly to get this project truly off of the ground, but it sends a message to people all around the world that online manga and comics is the way to get your series a lot of attention and giving creators the freedom to bring you new content without charging you crazy fees to check it out.
   What We Need & What You Get  The money we receive from your generosity will go towards programs more suited to making manga easier and more quickly, as well as making sure our artists, and voice actors, and audio engineers have the equipment  they need. Everyone working on this project has been working with enthusiasm for over a year and a half now, donating their time, and energy into this project for free.

However if we're can't make half of our goal we won't be able to even continue from here and the project would either slow down to a crawl until we can find a suitable investor that may not let us keep control of our stories, or the project may end entirely.    Why this matters to you  One of the biggest reasons we want this campaign to succeed is because, many of you write fanfiction, draw fanart, or want to do voice over for anime and games, but don't live near places where making manga or voicing for anime and games is possible. This is a chance for all of you to reach those dreams from where you live right now! We're looking for artists who want to make manga, and voice actors who want to get into the industry, but maybe don't have the money to move.

<p><strong>The Project</strong></p>
<p><em>   PostHuman</em> is an on-going comic book series from Hound Comics created by Andrew Armelim and Tristan Nall which tells the story of INTERPOL's Agent A.D.A.M. as he works with various law-enforcement agencies around the world to battle the global terrorist group, ARGUS.</p>
<p> We have a full creative team on board, with Tristan Nall writing, Andrew Armelin doing the pencils and letters, Alfonso Pinedo inking, and Kendall Goode on colors. </p>
<p>Throughout the story we wanted to deal with the themes of what it means to be human, especially when so many facets of our identities are represented through the Internet and social media. But as new generations become more in tune with the digital world, they are increasingly criticized for being unable to relate to people on a physical, personal level. These are the issues that challenge Adam every day of his new existence, literally, as his mind was moved from his physical human body to one of metal. </p>
<p><br/><strong>Our Goal</strong></p>
<p>   With the funds graciously donated by you, we hope to produce, print and distribute the first fully-colored issue of <em>PostHuman</em>. Creating the finished product for you to enjoy is our utmost concern, and appreciate whatever help you can supply to make this a reality.</p>
<p>   We have developed several exciting and unique perks for those of you who are able to contribute, from free digital downloads of the first issue to cool behind-the-scenes extras and even the opportunity to write something in the book itself.</p>
<p> Even if you are unable to donate, please share this project with your friends and colleagues so that we can make <em>PostHuman </em>a reality!</p>
<p> Creating a comic has been a long-time dream for the entire team and <em>PostHuman</em> has been a labor of love for everyone involved. We cannot express our gratitude enough for those of you who are able to help us out in any way possible.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Risks</strong></p>
<p>As with any comic book project, the biggest challenge we will face is that of delays. Right now we are already working on the first script so that we can begin working on the art the moment we meet our desired goal. With character designs and plotting done, we are positioned to produce our final product as quickly as possible without sacrificing the quality of our work. While we do not foresee any issues or delays, we will be sure to update with any news if it does occur.</p>

<p><strong>RUNX TALES #3</strong> will be a beautiful full-size comic book with a letterpress cover and a 4-page full-color spread! It includes an interview with writer Jincy Willett, stories of failed rent-boy attempts, a psychic exploration of San Jose, and a tribute to a drugstore that existed for reasons other than profit.</p>
<p>I'm having a lot of fun working with color and experimenting with different textures, and I'm excited about how this book is going to look. Right now, though, I'm trying to figure out how to cover printing costs. I'm not waiting tables anymore, which basically means I'm broke, and so that's why I'm here spange-ing on Indiegogo!</p>
<p>Because <strong>RUNX TALES #3</strong> will look so fancy, I have to charge $8 a copy, so for only 2 bucks more, <strong>you can pre-order yourself one and make sure I can cover the printing bill</strong>. That's <strong>only $10</strong>! I hate charging so much for it, especially after the first two issues were the 20th-century price of $3, but believe me, this one's gonna be so nice, it will be worth it!</p>
<p>If you're new to RUNX TALES, you can check out excerpts from #1 &amp; #2 <a href=""http://matt-runkle.com/runxtales.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. The first issue came out of nineties zine culture, and was tag-lined as telling stories about what it's like to be broke and gay in America. Since then it has evolved into a comic book that embraces its own book-ness. As web comics grow in popularity, the pieces featured in RUNX TALES #3 are stories that demand a tactile interaction, that are both textured and liberated by the turn of the page.</p>
<p><strong>RUNX TALES #3</strong> is going to be something you can't experience on a screen, something that will only translate in a physical book. Keep reading for an exciting preview!</p>
<p>PART ONE: <strong>The Drugstore Is Officially Dead</strong></p>
<p>If you're familiar with Oakland, you'll remember the old <strong>Super Longs</strong> drugstore, a place that can only be described as enchanted. A vanity centerpiece for the Longs chain, the store offered everything from hotdogs to flu shots, sewing notions to exotic statuary, art supplies to aisles and aisles of tropical foliage. It was open 24/7, which gave it that special late-night weirdness, and it was a resource both loved and depended on by the citizens of Oakland. When CVS bought out Longs in 2010, they stripped the store of its stock, giving it a slow, humiliating death before they finally close its doors for good. In this piece, a memorial of sorts, I take you on a tour of the old Super Longs, complete with barren shelves and <a href=""http://matt-runkle.blogspot.com/2011/09/some-more-items-in-memory-of-super.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">lovingly drawn merchandise</a> you can cut out and arrange yourself to bring those shelves to life again.</p>
<p>PART TWO: <strong>The Accidental Humorist</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jincy Willett</strong> is a writer who published a book of short stories, <em>Jenny &amp; the Jaws of Life</em>, in 1987. It was a book that caught the eye of then unknown <strong>David Sedaris</strong> as he was browsing the library shelves. He was so enthusiastic about it, he wanted to adapt one of its stories into a puppet show, and he asked Willett for permission by writing her her first -- and for a long time, <em>only</em> -- fan letter. Years later, Willett had long since completed a novel which was languishing without a publisher. Sedaris, meanwhile, was using his fame to talk up <em>Jenny &amp; the Jaws of Life.</em> His endorsement allowed Willett to finally publish that novel, <em>Winner of the National Book Award</em>. I, in turn, happened on <em>Winner</em> in 2007, and sent the author another fan letter, this one asking for an interview. I then adapted the conversation, where Jincy Willett describes her theory of a slapstick universe, into this <a href=""http://matt-runkle.blogspot.com/2012/04/sneak-peek-at-runx-tales-3.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">full-color comic</a>, layering paper to create illusions of dimension.

<p>PART THREE: <strong>My Two Daddies: Failed Rent Boy's Secrets Revealed</strong></p>
<p>In this piece, I use a split-page format to tell parallel narratives of two less than lucrative sugar daddies I had. Both of them were nice men who had very little money themselves, and the comic examines the strange power dynamics involved: the race and class issues, the windows into different kinds of loneliness, and the gray area between the needs for cash versus human contact.</p>
<p>PART FOUR: <strong>A Psychic Collaboration with Nora Benson-Glaspey</strong></p>
<p>In <a href=""http://www.parcellpress.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=301"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">RUNX TALES #2</a>, you met <strong>Nora Benson-Glaspey</strong>, who told the tale of Crow, a nightmarish weirdo who continued to haunt her life for several years. In this yet-untitled piece, I've teamed up with Nora again to examine the psychic landscape of <strong>San Jose</strong>, California. We take a tour of the Winchester Mansion, discuss the Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum, and later visit a psychic fair to interview some of its tablers. The investigation ends up raising more questions than answers: about the space between kitsch and sincere spiritual longing, as well as the ways a metaphysical landscape exists in a culture as materialistic as ours. This comic, in fact, is laid out like the labyrinthine Winchester Mansion, recurring among multiple dimensions, allowing the reader to either get lost or follow it in the manner of a choose-your-own-adventure. To read an interview with Nora, visit my <a href=""http://matt-runkle.blogspot.com/2012/01/business-of-staying-alive2-interview.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blog</a>.</p>

<p>The Yaoi Army is founded by Seru in December 2015. He is a low-key fudanshi and has read a wide variety of Yaoi stories. He enjoys fantasy, romance, supernatural and comedy.</p>
<p>Someday, Seru hopes and dreams of creating a story of his own. In July 2015, he starts writing random stories with different plots and over-the-top characters on Wattpad.</p>
<p>His first story is called “Seme Trapped in an Uke’s Perfect body,” a romantic comedy that revolves around Haru Arata, who claims to be a seme but has a perfect uke’s body. That story has laid the foundation to create his second story called “Fujoshi Trapped in a Seme’s Perfect Body,” a story about Haru’s parents.</p>
<p>Seru wants to take “Fujoshi” to the next level and adapt it into a manga-style format.</p>
<p>He has tried to reach more than a hundred artists (156 artists to be exact). Unfortunately, he has been ignored, politely rejected, or “seen-zoned.”</p>

Twin brothers on a summer adventure they won't soon forget. A tale of family, friends, life, love, sex and shenanigans all en route to meet a long lost father and kick him in the balls.
I am telling their story in a black & white 52 strip arc representing their 40 days of summer before college.  Read as they live life to the fullest and without regret. 
I love these boys and the eventual 5 year / 260 comic strip journey I desire to ultimately take them on is a tale not to be missed.  It is about growing, about understanding pride in who you are, about sex, about love and most importantly about family.
Follow their journey on FACEBOOK:

ABOUT ME
Being a writer has always been a passion of mine.  I have so many stories that I want to tell with the basis on human nature, capturing those little moments in time we can relate to. This piece specifically falls into that catagory. I am very proud of this project and hope to launch it as the inaugural title for my comic book line.

<p><strong>Update (7.3): I'll be moving into my new apartment and will be needing to get ink and everything ready. I've posted an estimate of when I believe I should be able to ship everything out to you guys.

<hr/><p>Hello there! I’m Olive Dugan, a quirky, passionate artist who has been attending University of the Arts since Fall 2010 for Animation. I’m 20 years old and am currently disabled by means of Tinnitus in my right ear, depression, anxiety, and a back condition that has yet to be diagnosed. I live with my lovely mother, my sister and two brothers of mine, but I plan on moving into an apartment. Nothing personal! I just want to get closer to school because Animation is an increeedibly stressing major. </p>
<p>I’m a silly lass, but when it comes down to it, this is a project that has been keeping me motivated for years. I’ve been adding to it and refining it for half a decade now and am still trucking. TwistedFates is important to me because it’s a collection of snippets of inspirations of my childhood mixed with elements that intrigue and inspire me today told through my creative mind in story format. It’s taken on different formats; I’ve self-published two novels on Lulu.com (and am in the process of rewriting one), am working on a webcomic (three, if you count these side comics), have started writing a wiki, and have even written small literature sketches and held contests to help my fans dive deeper into the world of TwistedFates. I actually look forward to getting to animating the project after I finish the webcomic, A Rose for Shurinai.</p>

<h2>What is Cup of Sugar? </h2>
<p>Cup of Sugar is a campaign with the purpose of raising money to support the project while entertaining the lots of fans. It’s a cute comic with adorable lovable characters that a friend and I have just started recently. I wanted to start this campaign because I don’t have connections unlike most people to get my project noticed. I want to raise funds to get supplies such as sketchbooks and drawing equipment and to advertise on topwebcomics.com and project wonderful. Sometimes, we all just need a little push.</p>
<h2><strong>What I'm Going to Need</strong></h2>
<p>Baby steps!</p>
<p>I wanted to start with a relatively small goal: $650. I wouldn’t mind if I got to at least $500, but I figured $1000 was too big of a goal for now. Tbh I'd love to get 100 copies of my novel printed, but again, I want to take this one step at a time! </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Here’s where the funds are going:</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">&gt;Sketchbooks and drawing equipment: my webcomic, TwistedFates: A Rose for Shurinai is a multimedia project; I do line work traditionally and the like, but I also like to save some of the supplies I have to provide them to artists in need or to have a little fun with artists on deviantART and provide them as prizes. It’s one way I like to interact with my fans.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">&gt;Advertising: I like to draw potential readers to my comic and even my deviantART group by means of project wonderful or deviantART’s service, adCast. The clicks add up, but it ends up being worth it! Sometimes, you just need that extra push! </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">&gt;Hosting: I am hosting my project on custom domains and need to pay for the costs to do so-- without Ads. Ads are annoying and mess up your reading process. You guys don't like ads.</p>
<p>So how about them perks? Oooo, I have some treats for you. Bookmarks, prints, stickers, novels, sketches and all that good stuff.</p>

<p>The main goal of my campaign is to provide free copies of Angelic Wars to our Disabled Veterans.  This goal is very important and personal to me because I myself is a Disabled Veteran.</p>
<p>Your Contributions will help me publish and print Angelic Wars comic books and graphic novels to give free to our brave wounded warriors who gave so much and ask so little.  Each copy sent to our Disabled Veterans will be personally signed by myself.</p>
</div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<h3><strong>What We Need</strong></h3>
<p>We need about $50,000 to make this happen.  But any funding would greatly be appreciated because I will find some way to make this happen with or without support or additional funding.</p>
<p>Most of the money will be spent to provide free comic books and graphic novels to Disabled Veterans. </p>
<p>Some of the money will also be spent to promote Angelic Wars and 10% of all sales of the comic books and graphic novels will go to the DAV (Disabled American Veterans).</p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal, I will use whatever funding I do receive to print free comic books for our Disabled Veterans.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>
<p>Your contributions will impact thousands of our Disabled Veterans returning home with numerous physical and mental issues caused while serving and protecting us all...  Our Disabled Veterans didn't just sacrifice for Americans, but people all around the world!</p>
<p>I have already managed to publish and print Angelic Wars Vol #1 and Vol #2 with my own funds.  I will make sure all contributions are used efficiently and with maximum effectiveness. </p>
</div>
<div> </div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<div>
<p>For those who are unable to contribute, please help by getting the word out to your family and friends.</p>
<p>You can also buy Angelic Wars comic books and graphic novels and 10% of those proceeds will go to help our wounded warriors.</p>
<p>Please use the Indiegogo share tools to help get the word out...</p>

</p><h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p class=""normal0020table1""><em><strong>Hope Flood</strong></em> is one of the top females in the industry with her commitment and dedication to females in comedy as well as her numerous ventures to keep comediennes upwardly mobile in the entertainment business. Hope has had a successful career in comedy for over 25 years. Surviving in any business for 25 years is an accomplishment within itself, especially in the male dominated business of comedy. <em><strong>Hope</strong></em> has accumulated a wealth of knowledge as she has paved the way for up and coming female comics and has been inspired to pass her experience on.</p>
<p class=""normal0020table1"">This inspiration is what gave birth to the <em><strong>Females In Comedy Association (FICA).</strong></em></p>
<p class=""normal0020table1""><em><strong>FICA</strong> </em>is a group designed for the comediennes to develop, refine and build on their craft as they learn how to break into or to stay in the business. <em><strong>FICA’s</strong> </em>sole purpose is for comediennes to network, mentor, and collaborate with one another as they learn to implement the skills of success. The <em><strong>Females in Comedy Convention (FICC)</strong></em> brings awareness and exposure to the talents of females in comedy. This group has spread world-wide and gained the attention of many comediennes all over the globe from the novice to the established seasoned professional. The only requirement is that you must be a Female Comedian who is open to learning and growing.</p>
<p class=""normal0020table1"">The<em><strong> FICC </strong></em>brings together female comedians for all across the US and Canada for a week of educational and career advancing opportunities. With intensive and accelerated workshops, seminars and information sessions, industry attended showcases, a variety of networking events and exposure in some of the top comedy clubs in LA. </p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise <strong>$10,000</strong> to cover the expenses of production. Needless to say producing a convention of this magnitude is no small feat and there is great cost involved. One of <em><strong>FICC’s</strong> </em>main goals is to be able to allow all comediennes who wish to take advantage of this opportunity to participate regardless of their ability to pay. As you can imagine many of these women are working mothers who frequently put the needs of their children/family above their own.</p>
<p>We would like to provide partial scholarships based on the financial needs of the comediennes so we can provide professional support for as many women as possible. <em><strong>FICA</strong> </em>supplemented the fees of 50% of the women who attended the 2013 convention.</p>

<p>In October of 2012, after a vague doctor's assessment and much googling, I decided to stop talking for all but 15 minutes a day.

<p>Hi! My name is Kayla Davis!</p>
<p>I have been running an autobiographical webcomic about my married life online since 2009. I open the doors and let everything just spill out. You get to see what it's like to be the new age odd couple living in the bible belt of the south. Somethings are funny, somethings are sad, something are just weird. Like my obsession with murder mysteries, my husband's love of all things Mecha, and my current quest to get a mini horse!</p>
<p>I am now trying to get an anthology of the comics put together in a new book called: Casually Kayla Anthology. Also, I am trying to produce a book about our recent trip to Japan.</p>

<h2><strong>Your Mission, if you choose to accept it:</strong></h2>
<p>I need donations to cover the cost and production and marketing of the books. You're not getting 1 book, but you are actually getting 3 books in this project.</p>

<p>I am looking to print at least 500 books total, and that cost some mad cash. But believe me, you are investing in quality products and all around funny stuff!</p>
<p>Everyone who donates will be kept in the loop with updates on the book progress and updated on the goal chart.  Yes!  we have a goal chart!  Check back often to see how long my scarf grows!  Stretch goals will also be announced there.</p>

My name is Mark Conner and I am the writer and photographer of Chamber of the Soul. I also play the part of Braxton Sinclair. I began working on this project with my friends our senior year in high school.  Over a year has passed and now we've almost finished. But not quite.

If I don't answer any of your questions below please feel free to ask!   What We Need & What You Get All of the money we earn is going to pay for the costs of printing these books.


We are using Ka-blam digital printing to publish these books and have already received two copies from them as proofs. This company has been incredibly helpful with this project and we are happy to be using their services. 


It costs about $15 to print each book the additional money we are charging for the book is going directly to paying for shipping costs because the books have two trips to make: 1) From the printer to me and then 2) from me to you. 

 If we have any extra money we will be purchasing more copies of the book which we'll keep to sell in local bookshops and things. 
For the most part we are only giving away copies of the books because that is what this campaign is for, we don't want to waste your money on other perks. 
If you give any amount between $1 and $19 you will receive our most sincere thanks and this money will directly help pay for the printing and shipping of the books.
For $20 you will receive the Chamber of the Soul book
 For $25 the author Mark Conner and cast member Robin Kovac will sign it.
The only perk that includes something other than a book is the $50 perk, if you give this amount you will receive a film negative from Chamber of the Soul. One of the things that makes this project unique is that it was shot entirely on 35mm film and we want people to be able to have a piece of that.

Risks & Challenges
 
The only challenge we anticipate is that of time. It will take up to month for the books to get from the printer to us and then our small team working out of a dorm room will do our best to get the books out to you as quickly as possible. 
  Other Ways You Can Help I realize not everyone is capable of giving money but if you would still like to help there is something you can do. Spread the word using your favorite form of social media whether that Facebook, Tumblr, Twitter or proclaiming it from the rooftops and I will be forever grateful. Thank you.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

My name is Alicia Smith and I am the creator of Quarter Kids Handmade dolls. My dolls have been featured on the Bad Girls Club season 7,and Criss Angel Mindfreak. They have been placed in the hands of tons of rockstars, and tv personalities such as.. Morgan Freeman, Martin Atkins, Oprah Winfrey, Robert Englund, Norman Reedus. Just to name a few! I am finally creating a comic book! We need your help to get this accomplished! This comic will be issue 0 of many to come! This is an introduction into the lives and personalities of my characters. Watch them as they come to life in this 16 page comic book.

It has been a dream of mine, for a long time, to get this comic book finished and with a little help from my friends, family, and fans, I hope to accomplish this.

Hur många av bibelns personligheter som blev mer än 175 år, och hur många som blev äldre än 900 år gamla.

Hur många gånger treenigheten nämns i bibeln.

Uppdateringar: Vi har också passat på att göra justeringar och andra uppdateringar av texten i boken. 



Syftet är att roa, bilda och utmana. 

Bibeln är världens mest sålda, och stulna bok. Ändå är det en bok som väldigt få har läst ordentligt. Faktum är att väldigt få kristna vet vad den innehåller förutom de fina delar om kärlek och förlåtelse som vi får serverade i våra kyrkor.
Bibeln har stor påverkan på samhället i vår värld. Regeringar tar beslut med bibeln som stöd. Mänskliga rättigheter kränks och barn skräms med ""hjälp"" av bibeln. I sekulariserade Sverige ser vi tecken på detta, men i andra delar av världen är detta ett mycket mer påtagligt faktum.
Således är det väl rimligt att vi får möjlighet att bilda oss en bred bild av innehållet i  bibeln. Med hjälp av boken Tokiga Bibelord blir perspektivet på bibeln helt enkelt bredare och förhoppningsvis roligare.
Boken är utformad så att det skall vara lätt att läsa, dela eller visa upp för att starta diskussioner och tankar. Vilken trovärdighet kan vi ge bibeln? Tokiga Bibelord hjälper kanske till att reda ut den frågan...

Our Story
Thank you for taking the time to view this campaign. My name
is Savannah Houston-McIntyre, and I am the writer and producer of ï¿½Amyaï¿½. I work alongside my co-writer Andrew Hewitt, as well as my illustrator Rebecca Gunter.

Amya is a high-fantasy graphic novel that my comrades and I 
have dedicated our time and skill to publishing since mid-2009. In the first 
chapter, ï¿½Amya: Unexpected Meetings,ï¿½ readers were introduced to a ragtag team 
of adventurers who were brought together by chance.  In Chapter 
Two we follow Faye, Accel, and Kaden as they are pulled into an adventure that 
is greater than any of them could have anticipated; or ever expect to fulfill.

Iï¿½m afraid that I will not be able to put these forty seven pages of Chapter Two 
in your hands without help from you. 
It is my hope that you will help me raise 1/3 of the cost to 
print Chapter Two, or $750 USD.   Anything we raise above that 
amount will aid in printing the project sooner, or add to the amount we are able 
to print.

For those of you who are able to donate towards either the 
digital or print editions, weï¿½re pleased to be offer five bonus pages of additional content!  I wish to thank you again for

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-US"">Many centuries ago, the world was divided
by the gods in six continents, each one of them protected by its own god. The

who created evil creatures to destroy the gods' creation.<br/><br/></span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-US"">Ubel faced the gods, showing them to be

I accept that the possibility exists that this Ann person could be a complete fraud who will abscond with my money, but that this possibility only exists in the mind of one attorney on the face of the earth, because Ann knows full well that if she does not give the money to the charities she has claimed that the wrath of the Internet will be upon her.

<p class=""p1""><strong>TIGER LAWYER Explained:</strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">What is this Tiger Lawyer, you ask? Well, it’s simple. <em><strong>Tiger Lawyer</strong></em> is a tiger... who is also a lawyer. And a damn good one too. But it’s more than just a concept, it’s an original comic book series that reaches out into different genres, styles, and tones, and features multiple artists and creators, namely the amazing primary art team of <em><strong>Matt McCray</strong></em>, <em><strong>Vic Malhotra</strong></em>, and <em><strong>Adam Metcalfe</strong></em>.</p>
<p class=""p2"">The format for TIGER LAWYER comics is what makes it special. Each deluxe print issue comes in a flip-book style, meaning there are two front covers. Each “side” of the comic features a different Tiger Lawyer story presented in a different genre, with art from different artists. For example, one side of the comic, with its own cover, will feature a courtroom-action-comedy story, while the other side will feature a gritty, hard-boiled crime noir story. And the meat in the middle of the two stories comes in the form of several pin-ups from artists all across the globe.</p>
<p class=""p2""><em>Tiger Lawyer #1</em> was released in April 2012, and we sold out of our first printing of 150 copies over the course of the Vancouver and Calgary comic conventions, not including the additional 100 copies purchased through the online store. Tiger Lawyer has also garnered some good buzz around the internet, including a nod from Image publisher Eric Stephenson and a featured interview on CBR’s Robot 6 blog. But the coolest thing to happen to Tiger Lawyer is its inclusion in <em><strong>HELL YEAH</strong></em> from Image comics (Joe Keatinge, Andre Szymanowicz), in the form of one-page back-up stories, beginning this July in <em>Hell Yeah #4</em>.</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>This campaign:</strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">This campaign is for TIGER LAWYER #2, which will further the adventures, excitement, thrills, and comedy of the first issue. We’re going even bigger and better with issue two, creating a single issue so jam-packed with comics, you’d think it was two comics jam-packed in one. Oh wait... it is!</p>
<p class=""p2"">The single stories in TIGER LAWYER #2 are longer, zanier, and grittier than before, and we’ve got some truly wonderful talent committed to contributing pin-up artwork, and more on the way. As a bonus, the issue will also include an all-new REVENGE ROOSTER mini-comic from writer Fabian Rangel Jr. and artist James Gilmer. </p>
<p class=""p2"">TIGER LAWYER #1 was just the start.</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>What we need:</strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">Tiger Lawyer is (as of right now) completely self-published under my (writer-creator Ryan Ferrier) independent self-publishing imprint Challenger Comics. Simply put, making comics is not cheap, and very rarely will you make a penny at the end of the day. Everything that costs something, is incurred by me, including artist fees, printing, shipping, marketing materials, convention fees, travelling, etc. So why do I do it? Because I love it, and feel I have to do it. If you’ve got a story you want to tell, do it. I love comics so much, I will go broke to make them. I’d rather not go broke however... so here’s where Indiegogo comes in. </p>
<p class=""p2"">Hopefully, with your help and generous donation, we can continue to make Tiger Lawyer comics, as well as provide you with some awesome rewards and keepsakes. Everybody wins, and we all have comics and fun. </p>
<p class=""p2"">Our goal is to raise $3,000 for <em><strong>Tiger Lawyer #2</strong></em>. This will cover artist fees and printing of the book. If we don’t reach our goal, the book will still be printed, and all perks will still be awarded. Any funds exceeding our goal will go towards keeping our online store afloat, as well as being put aside for the inevitable TIGER LAWYER #3.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Keep an eye on the campaign, as I’ll be posting updates on the project over the next 45 days. Maybe some new incentives too.</p>

Bit fuzzy from resizing"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/Qg75tDn.jpg?1"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Modern Magic Logo""/></em></strong></h2>
<h2><strong><em>Note: For a better description into this, watch the above video.</em></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>Who I am and why I made this</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul><p>     As I say in the video, I am Cohen Babcock, a young man who wants to make his dream of writing and drawing comics come true. Ever since I was a kid, I've believed the best part of anything was laughter, that most pure sense of happiness. My entire goal is to create a comic, and in the future several others, all to bring happiness to people and to spread the joy I've felt in reading other stories whenever I've needed the help. All I need is the equipment and a chance.</p>
<p>     I made this campaign because I felt that this is the best choice. I'm at a point in my life where I've practiced for years to where I'm satisfied enough to release it, and I have the time and energy to do it. It's just that I can't afford to get the stuff I need to be able to do this.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>The campaign idea</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul><p>     The entire point of this, then, is to share my made up stories with people, to entertain them. If I can reach my goal, I'll release this comic a page a week, chopped into chapters, all for free as a webcomic. This means every week you'll be able to read and enjoy, and share it to all who want to read it.</p>
<p>     After this comic, if the equipment holds and people still want to read, I'll keep making more. This is going to be an initial fund, and I won't need anything other than the base equipment. So unless I've been run out of the country, I'll keep making comics for you, even bigger and better than before.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Comic</strong></li>
</ul><p>     A world where magic never died out, magical creatures sprawl throughout the world, enjoying the ease of technology. A man simply known as The Shade tricks an orphaned child into becoming a genie, a being with immense power. A man today, known as Artem, is given the genie, now hundreds of years captured and skilled in all forms of magic, to use as he will. Artem decides the best course of action is to allow him freedom while he decides on a wish, and to leave him unsupervised. It was a poor decision to say the least.</p>
<p>     Written as a comedy with a darker side, you can follow these two as they get in awkward adventures and try to settle down into a crazy situation they've created for themselves, every week starting 2014.</p>
<h2><strong>What this campaign does for me, and you!</strong></h2>
<p>     I can go on and on about how you'll be helping the creative community, but it boils down to this: I want to make comics, you might like to read comics, and that's why. If I can get the funding I can begin to create and make these stories for everyone who's interested. It's my dream to create stories, to make you laugh with me in this, so if I earn the money, that's what I'm going to do.</p>
<p>Now for the money </p>
<p><img alt=""Snippet"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/KwNWume.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Artem and Ghost""/></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What I'll get</strong></li>
</ul><p><strong>      </strong>Aside from money, I'll get something else. I'll be using that money to gain equipment for the site. Most prominently I need to get a new computer, tablet, and the adobe programs. Now, due to a great friend, I can get the tablet and adobe for $500 and the extra bit goes to a computer to run this. The extra fifty is then to balance out the cost of the indiegogo, so I can afford everything still. Notice that this is the cheapest I can work with.</p>
<p>     I will update you guys on every purchase with this money. If I buy a sandwich, I will tell you everything from the toppings to the crumb number, because you are sending me this money for a reason, and I want to ensure you get what you're promised.</p>
<p><strong>Any extra money will be used for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Upgrading the tablet and computer</li>
<li>Paying my web-designer and technician for his service</li>
<li>Investing for further purchases that may be needed, repairs and internet cost etc.</li>
<li>Fulfilling the perks! (below)</li>
</ul><p>o    <strong>Stretch goals</strong></p>
<p>For every $100 we achieve, I will release a page of the prologue in the gallery, up to $1,200, to be released starting on the 12th of March.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>$1,200</strong></li>
<li>I'll fulfill all perks and begin release of the comic by January 1st, 2014, along with releasing the first 12 pages of the 21 page prologue. </li>
<li><strong>$2,000</strong></li>
<li>I Will finish all of Modern Magic's writing by the end of 2013, and begin writing and drawing up things for my second story, to be announced.</li>
<li><strong>$3,000</strong></li>
<li><strong>*Will reveal after reaching 1,200*</strong></li>
</ul><p><strong> </strong></p>

<li><strong>How I'll repay you</strong></li>
</ul><p>Of course donating on its own is nice, but I owe you for every cent, so like many, I've used perks to give you a little gift. Most of them are drawings or involving the comic, but please understand that's the best I can do. These commissions and drawings will be done to the absolute best of my abilities, so to adapt to the program, it may take up to two or three months before I'm able to fulfill it all, and I apologize, but I want that to be clear that patience will be required</p>
<p>Also, all perks require a valid email address to reach you by. If your indiegogo contact info is invalid, please message me by email or this site and I'll try to confirm it.</p>
<p>Any ideas for perks you want to see? You donate more than I set as the highest perk, and want a deal? Email me, and if you guys would like it, I'll set it up if I can.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2><strong>How else you can help</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul><p>While donating is fantastic, I understand not being able to donate money. Lack of money is why this campaign exists!</p>
<p>Any way you can help is wonderful, and if you can't afford a perk, please just share the project, or even just share the comic once it's done. Every bit counts, and thank you for at least reading this far.</p>
<p>And of course, wish me luck.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Commission Details:</strong></h2>
<p><strong>How Do Commissions Work?</strong></p>
<p>First, it depends on the type. A character commission is my way of saying I will draw one person with some accessories and items, no backgrounds or multiple characters. A full commission will be characters, backgrounds, multiple panels, etc.</p>
<p>All commissions will be within 12x12 inches, more than likely in a 11.5x8 inch format for printing availability unless otherwise requested.</p>
<p>After the campaign, I will begin setting up the new equipment and website, and as soon as I'm comfortable with the equipment, I will begin emailing you individually (starting with the basic commissions and working up to the full color multiples) talking about a basic idea. I will take creative license over this with certain details, but I'll try to make what you want as well, so expect some decent contact using the provided email.</p>
<p><img alt=""The Soapy Walrus"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/1bIQwYI.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""The King takes a bath""/></p>
<p><strong>What is appropriate?</strong></p>
<p>To make sure I don't agree to draw inappropriate content by misunderstandings, please stick to these rules with commissions:</p>
<ul>
<li>No sex</li>
<li>No nudity</li>
<li>No gore</li>
<li>No monstrous abominations that will haunt my very nightmares</li>
</ul><p>I feel that this is just and fair, to keep everything appropriate. Please don't push the envelope, because unless you genuinely don't understand me there shouldn't be any issues with what I mean by appropriate.</p>

     As I say in the video, I am Cohen Babcock, a young man who wants to make his dream of writing and drawing comics come true. Ever since I was a kid, I've believed the best part of anything was laughter, that most pure sense of happiness. My entire goal is to create a comic, and in the future several others, all to bring happiness to people and to spread the joy I've felt in reading other stories whenever I've needed the help. All I need is the equipment and a chance.
     I made this campaign because I felt that this is the best choice. I'm at a point in my life where I've practiced for years to where I'm satisfied enough to release it, and I have the time and energy to do it. It's just that I can't afford to get the stuff I need to be able to do this.


The campaign idea

     The entire point of this, then, is to share my made up stories with people, to entertain them. If I can reach my goal, I'll release this comic a page a week, chopped into chapters, all for free as a webcomic. This means every week you'll be able to read and enjoy, and share it to all who want to read it.
     After this comic, if the equipment holds and people still want to read, I'll keep making more. This is going to be an initial fund, and I won't need anything other than the base equipment. So unless I've been run out of the country, I'll keep making comics for you, even bigger and better than before.

The Comic
     A world where magic never died out, magical creatures sprawl throughout the world, enjoying the ease of technology. A man simply known as The Shade tricks an orphaned child into becoming a genie, a being with immense power. A man today, known as Artem, is given the genie, now hundreds of years captured and skilled in all forms of magic, to use as he will. Artem decides the best course of action is to allow him freedom while he decides on a wish, and to leave him unsupervised. It was a poor decision to say the least.
     Written as a comedy with a darker side, you can follow these two as they get in awkward adventures and try to settle down into a crazy situation they've created for themselves, every week starting 2014.
What this campaign does for me, and you!
     I can go on and on about how you'll be helping the creative community, but it boils down to this: I want to make comics, you might like to read comics, and that's why. If I can get the funding I can begin to create and make these stories for everyone who's interested. It's my dream to create stories, to make you laugh with me in this, so if I earn the money, that's what I'm going to do.
Now for the money 


What I'll get
      Aside from money, I'll get something else. I'll be using that money to gain equipment for the site. Most prominently I need to get a new computer, tablet, and the adobe programs. Now, due to a great friend, I can get the tablet and adobe for $500 and the extra bit goes to a computer to run this. The extra fifty is then to balance out the cost of the indiegogo, so I can afford everything still. Notice that this is the cheapest I can work with.
     I will update you guys on every purchase with this money. If I buy a sandwich, I will tell you everything from the toppings to the crumb number, because you are sending me this money for a reason, and I want to ensure you get what you're promised.
Any extra money will be used for:

Upgrading the tablet and computer
Paying my web-designer and technician for his service
Investing for further purchases that may be needed, repairs and internet cost etc.
Fulfilling the perks! (below)
o    Stretch goals
For every $100 we achieve, I will release a page of the prologue in the gallery, up to $1,200, to be released starting on the 12th of March.

$1,200
I'll fulfill all perks and begin release of the comic by January 1st, 2014, along with releasing the first 12 pages of the 21 page prologue. 
$2,000
I Will finish all of Modern Magic's writing by the end of 2013, and begin writing and drawing up things for my second story, to be announced.
$3,000
*Will reveal after reaching 1,200*

How I'll repay you
Of course donating on its own is nice, but I owe you for every cent, so like many, I've used perks to give you a little gift. Most of them are drawings or involving the comic, but please understand that's the best I can do. These commissions and drawings will be done to the absolute best of my abilities, so to adapt to the program, it may take up to two or three months before I'm able to fulfill it all, and I apologize, but I want that to be clear that patience will be required
Also, all perks require a valid email address to reach you by. If your indiegogo contact info is invalid, please message me by email or this site and I'll try to confirm it.
Any ideas for perks you want to see? You donate more than I set as the highest perk, and want a deal? Email me, and if you guys would like it, I'll set it up if I can.


How else you can help

While donating is fantastic, I understand not being able to donate money. Lack of money is why this campaign exists!
Any way you can help is wonderful, and if you can't afford a perk, please just share the project, or even just share the comic once it's done. Every bit counts, and thank you for at least reading this far.
And of course, wish me luck.
 
Commission Details:
How Do Commissions Work?
First, it depends on the type. A character commission is my way of saying I will draw one person with some accessories and items, no backgrounds or multiple characters. A full commission will be characters, backgrounds, multiple panels, etc.
All commissions will be within 12x12 inches, more than likely in a 11.5x8 inch format for printing availability unless otherwise requested.
After the campaign, I will begin setting up the new equipment and website, and as soon as I'm comfortable with the equipment, I will begin emailing you individually (starting with the basic commissions and working up to the full color multiples) talking about a basic idea. I will take creative license over this with certain details, but I'll try to make what you want as well, so expect some decent contact using the provided email.

What is appropriate?
To make sure I don't agree to draw inappropriate content by misunderstandings, please stick to these rules with commissions:

No sex
No nudity
No gore
No monstrous abominations that will haunt my very nightmares
I feel that this is just and fair, to keep everything appropriate. Please don't push the envelope, because unless you genuinely don't understand me there shouldn't be any issues with what I mean by appropriate.
Questions, Comments, Concerns, Suggestions? Email me at FancyEvilsOwner@gmail.com

Any and all relevant questions will be put below and the response placed below.
Questions answered:
Q:I'm not sure if you mentioned it or not - but will you be releasing this as a webcomic?
A: Yes, it will all be on the site fancyevils.com when I set it up by the end of the year, and released weekly, a page per week, until it's finished. Dependent on response, I may eventually sell full copies by PDF or paperback, but it will always be free online for anyone.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

The Lord has called me to minister The Gospel/Good News to the World, not just to my fellow brothers/sisters in Christ. Help me create a Christian Comedian platform in the Gospel and Mainstream Communities. Christian Comedy is considered to be the last frontier in comedy, help me to make this historical Convention and trail blaze this type of comedy into Mainstream America and the World). <br/></p>

I can go on a 3-day Fast if I don't make my campaign goal. I can eat when I get back to Dallas...LOL! If I make my campaign goal, I will forever be grateful to everyone who contributed to the success of this trip.

<h3>About the project:</h3>
<p>This project explores the geographical touchstones of the life of the poet, playwright and aesthete, Oscar Wilde. From the perspective of cartoonist and travelogueist, Lucy Knisley (a long-time Wilde fan), this project follows in his path from his birthplace and college to the city of his theatrical triumphs, and on to the site of his imprisonment and the hotel where he died in exile. Part travelogue, part historical study, part personal exploration of his writing and life, Lucy will write and draw about the places where Wilde lived and worked, creating a book about Wilde's history and the adventure of tracing his life.</p>
<p>The plane tickets are already taken care of (thanks, Dad!), but there's still a bit to go before this trip can take place. Please consider making a donation to raise the funds for hostels and train tickets, art costs for labor and supplies, and help to make this book a reality. In exchange, you'll have your pick of art prints, a preview chapter, postcards from the journey, kudos in the book, a custom portrait, and a page from the actual travelogue!</p>

<h3><strong>My Story</strong></h3>
<p>I have been drawing my own comics since about second grade. I was first inspired by anime such as Dragonball. I am completely self-taught. I have also been practicing martial arts and competing in combat sports since a young child.</p>
<p>When I was 18, I left a full ride to the University of Illinois to pursue my passion as a boxer. I excelled at boxing and even became a Chicago Golden Gloves champion.</p>
<p>After dropping out of school, I continued drawing and studying on my own. I developed an interest in learning Japanese. I took two years at the local community college and excelled and have been self-studying since then. I am now able to speak, read and write Japanese.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Study in Japan</strong></h3>
<p>In August, 2017, after deciding to take my art seriously, I quit my job and flew myself to Japan for one month. While there, I studied the manga storytelling style and trained at a professional boxing gym.  My experience in Japan inspired me to go back to school.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>What Am I Doing Now?</strong></h3>
<p>When I came back to the states last fall, I immediately got to work drawing and studying manga. I completed several short stories and the first edition of my series, Azuki. I also started teaching a manga workshop about the differences between the Eastern and Western storytelling style that I learned while in Japan.</p>
<p>I finished community college in 3 semesters and started studying Studio Art at Eastern Illinois University this fall. All of my free-time is dedicated to working on my manga series.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Cost</strong></h3>
<p>I am now ready to release my series Azuki but do not have the funding to do so. Printing copies and advertising cost quite a bit so I finally decided to start this fundraising campaign.</p>
<p>Any funding that I do receive goes toward the following:</p>
<p>Book printing fees; My goal is to sell 500 copies of each of the 4 books</p>
<p>Fees for travelling to conventions</p>
<p>Fees for travelling to teach workshops</p>
<p>Website maintenance</p>
<p>Social Media promotion and advertisements</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What makes Azuki so special?</h3>
<p>There are many Black people all over the world that love Anime and Manga, but there aren't very many Black characters. Azuki is a strong and determined young Black girl who breaks down stereotypes, yet her story is accessible to all ages and all colors.</p>
<p>My goals is to bring Japanese and American culture together. I believe that we have so much to learn from each other culturally, philosophically and artistically. Azuki is the first step that I am taking at a large-scale in this regard.</p>
<p>I want to share my love of Manga and shed new light on it as a truly intellectual medium to a wider Western audience.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Becoming a manga artist is no easy task for a Japanese person. It is even more difficult for a foreigner. Further, the life of an artist in general can be difficult.</p>
<p>But, I have learned from boxing that if you believe in yourself and your dream, that you can overcome any hurdle. It takes work, grit, effort and determination to succeed. I had to work very hard to complete community college while working and boxing and drawing manga in order to start art school this semester.</p>
<p>I didn't have to go back to school but I decided to humble myself and receive classical training. As you can see by my voyage to Japan, I am willing to do whatever it takes to make my vision a reality.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you don't have the money to contribute, but would still like to help don't fret!</p>
<p>I greatly appreciate any and all supporters. After all, it's not just about the money.</p>

<p><strong>Vampirella's History</strong></p>
<p>Vampirella is one of the most iconic comic book characters ever published.  Created in 1969 by horror icon Forrest J. Ackerman, she has thrived for nearly 50 years delivering classic tales of terror in comics, graphic novels, and magazines.  And over those years the art and covers of Vampirella Magazine defined the horror genre with master illustrators like Frank Frazetta, Sanjulian, Bill Hughes, Jose Gonzalez, Enrich, Esteban Maroto, and Paul Gulacy along with a host of other legendary artists.  Now Dynamite Entertainment celebrates the vibrant history of the one and only Vampirella with a functioning Tarot Card Deck that captures these timeless images in a unique and enjoyable collectible.</p>

</div></div>","Vampirella's History
Vampirella is one of the most iconic comic book characters ever published.  Created in 1969 by horror icon Forrest J. Ackerman, she has thrived for nearly 50 years delivering classic tales of terror in comics, graphic novels, and magazines.  And over those years the art and covers of Vampirella Magazine defined the horror genre with master illustrators like Frank Frazetta, Sanjulian, Bill Hughes, Jose Gonzalez, Enrich, Esteban Maroto, and Paul Gulacy along with a host of other legendary artists.  Now Dynamite Entertainment celebrates the vibrant history of the one and only Vampirella with a functioning Tarot Card Deck that captures these timeless images in a unique and enjoyable collectible.
This first game offering from Dynamite Entertainment is a fun and exciting way to immerse yourself in the world of Vampirella.  This set of 78 Vampirella Tarot cards comes in a unique Kickstarter exclusive illustrated box for our supporters.  The cards are built in a beautiful art deco style that embraces the vintage look and feel of the classic Vampirella Magazine covers.  
 

Stretch Goals:
We love  Stretch Goals because they give all of the supporters who make the projects possible even more value as the program grows.  For this IndieGogo we will be revealing several new stretch goals as we achieve the levels.  Watch here for the announcements of each new level!
Stretch Goal #1 - $2500  Print Editions of The Expanded Arcana! 
We are very happy to announce this stretch goal in which if we can reach the $2,5000 mark by the time the program is complete, everyone at the print pledge level ($35) and above will receive three printed playable Expanded Arcana Tarot Cards and instructions on how to use them! These cards are unique to IndieGogo and Kickstarter and feature art from Jae Lee, Joe Jusko, and Amanda Conner.  Note - if we reach this goal - the Kickstarter supporters will also receive the additional prizes!
Stretch Goal #2 - $7000  To Be Revealed
 
The Mystic Tarot
These cards are part of a fully functioning set of major and minor arcana tarot cards.  The complete box set comes with instructions for playing the divination game and provides everything you need to use the cards.  Whether you believe in the power of the cards or not, this unique collectible is both an entertaining game and a truly vintage collectible.  

 
This set of Vampirella tarot cards contains art from some of the all-time masters of the craft and are a fun way to collect a piece of comics history in a unique collectible package.  Now you can enjoy the images that defined an iconic character in one deluxe package.  And you can entertain friends with the discussion of the tarot cards as a game or a divination tool.  You can interpret the cards and decide the fates being revealed through the game.

 
This is the first offering by Dynamite Entertainment into the collectible games category.  We are very thankful to all of our friends and fans that help to make this possible and we are working to bring other fun and entertaining gaming opportunities to you soon.  Thanks for helping us to make this first project a success and to allow us to share this vintage Vampirella art with you.

<p>""out of the abundance of the heart, my art flows.”</p>
<p>To tell the story of Gi-gi, I must start from the year I took an interest in watercolors. Though I grew up in a very artistic family, I’ve never had any formal art trainings. So, every time I want to try something new, it still feels like a big challenge to me. I had no equipment or material, nor any money at that time to buy them. But I had a good determination, so I found an old box of watercolor pencil. “Ah-ha,” I thought, “this will work!” I took the pencil, shave them into dust, mixed them with water and created my own watercolor paste. </p>
<p>I have a postcard featuring a painting of a family of foxes taped in front of my desk. It was something that I bought a few years ago, and something about that painting really touched my heart. But sometimes when I looked at it, it made me a little sad. I knew I loved the painting, but I also knew I don’t have the skill to paint something as beautiful. So I looked up a bunch of fox drawings on Google and Pinterest. I tried to copy and alternate the technique and styles. Then I practiced, but nothing came out too satisfying. My art just didn’t look as good as the others… Finally, I gave up on trying.</p>
<p>Giving up turns out to be one of the best things! Because that’s the moment when I decided to come up with something of my own. Something that represented me, and that is not confined by limitations. A huge head, small body, short limbs, and an oversized tail. Someone who didn’t look at the world the right-side up, and someone who won’t forget to smile. That was how the first painting of Gi-gi was born. </p>

<p>I am starting this campaign for two reasons. </p>
<ol>
<li>I’ve always wanted to make my drawing into prints. This is my first attempt. It’s scary to me, but with your help I believe I can do it. This time I am only printing calendars and postcards. But one day I hope to have many products like wall arts, notebooks, children’s books…etc. By making my art into prints, you’ll help them reach a wider audience. My hope is that my work will not only brighten people’s days, but also be an encouragement to them.</li>
<li>I am going on my journey to study at Bethel Supernatural School of Ministry (BSSM) this August. I truly believe my time at BSSM will help me to become a stronger person and to live in greater freedom. I also hope that as I grow in Christ, my arts will also grow, and that I’ll be able to share even more stories with you. To read more about my journey to BSSM, please <strong><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/notes/amymeowu/my-unexpected-journey-bssm/2793661117317174/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CLICK HERE</a>.</strong> As a Taiwanese-Belizean I will not be able to work while on my student visa. Which means I’ll need to have all my school funding, including living expense available before I leave.</li>
</ol>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560803411/m8t0lwkoktjtqzl7eyu1.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The money I raise will help me in so many ways. From printing and packaging, visa application, tuition and living expenses, to distribution of products at local stores in Taiwan and in Belize. But what meant the most to me is not just the money. By supporting this campaign you’ve encouraged me as an artist, and for that, I truly, deeply appreciate it. I also hope my art and my story has been an inspiration to you, and a blessing.</p>

<p>This project took me a while to complete. I knew I wanted to share Gi-gi with you, but throwing a bunch of cute drawing of Gi-gi together just won’t do. Gi-gi was created to be free and to inspire, so I knew it has to be something from my heart. </p>
<p>I’ve put together 12 different theme/memo. These are words that I love, yet in this overwhelming life, we seem to easily forget. So, what better place to put these on, than a calendar that we’ll get to look at every day. </p>
<p>The calendar includes Gi-gi, her best friend Abby, the raccoon, and Savanna, the mouse. I’ve also added the grey fox, the green iguana, the sea turtle, and Belize national bird, the keel-billed toucan, featuring a few of the lovely animals of Belize, where I grew up.</p>

<p>All printing will be done in Taiwan. I am aiming to print 500 copies or more on each one of the designs to bring down the printing cost. The original paintings are all done in Belize, where I am located. But I’ll be mailing the originals to Taiwan ahead of time. So both originals and prints can be packaged and mailed out directly from Taiwan.</p>
<p>Printing and Packaging will start immediately when the campaign ends. It should take no more than 20 working days to be ready for shipping. Shipment depends on what part of the world you’re located .</p>
<p>Since this campaign is made for both supporting the artwork and for supporting the artist’s schooling. The price is set for its purpose. In the future, extra printing will still be distributed to different shops for you to purchase. However, price will differ depending on the shop and its country.</p>

<p>This is my first crowdfunding project, I have carefully prepared everything to the littlest details before I launch this campaign. The paintings are done. The printing company is settled, and test prints has been made. So everything should go smoothly. But because this is my first crowdfunding project, I might have overlooked some details. If that happens and printing and shipping is delayed, please bear with me, and I’ll do my best to have it resolved as soon as possible. </p>
<p>As for the part of your support that goes towards my schooling at BSSM, there is a risk of being rejected of my student visa. If unfortunately that happens, I will make good use of the money on creating more artworks, enroll in classes like digital painting, or purchasing materials. All funding will go towards my studio and not my personal use.</p>

<p>「我的藝術創作，源自於一顆豐沛的心。」</p>
<p>說到橘橘的故事，就必須從我開始對水彩感興趣那年說起。雖然我成長於一個藝術家庭，卻從來沒受過正式藝術訓練。所以每當我想嘗試新事物的時候，總覺得充滿挑戰。我沒有工具，也沒有材料，更沒有足夠買這些用品的經費，但是我意志堅定，找到一盒舊水彩色鉛筆，心想：「哈哈！這個可以用！」於是我拿起色鉛筆，削成粉末，與水混合，然後創造出自己的水彩顏料。</p>
<p>我的書桌前貼著一張明信片，上面畫著狐狸一家人。這張明信片是我在幾年前買的，上面的圖畫深深感動著我。不過，當我看著這幅畫時，偶爾會覺得難過。我知道自己喜歡畫畫，但也知道自己沒有足夠的繪畫技巧能畫出這麼美麗的畫面。所以我在 Google 和 Pinterest 找到許多狐狸的圖畫，試著模仿與改變繪畫技巧和風格，然後不停練習，但是成果都不太理想。我的作品就是比不過其他人的作品… 最後我放棄了。</p>
<p>沒想到，放棄模仿變成了最棒的一件事！因為那一刻，我決定用自己的風格，創造出代表自己的作品，一個不受各種框架侷限的作品：大大的頭、小小的身體、短短的四肢，還有一個超大的尾巴，這個狐狸會顛倒著看世界，而且絕不會忘記微笑，這就是橘橘誕生的過程。<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561004162/i7bspf4pe8w4fr6apbwo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>開始這個集資計畫有兩個原因：</p>
<ol>
<li>把作品印出來的想法一直在我心中，而這是我第一次付諸實行。對我而言這很恐怖，但有你的協助，我相信我做得到。這次我只會印製年曆和明信片，但希望未來可以印製更多的產品，例如牆面裝置藝術、筆記本、童書等。你的支持，將讓我的藝術作品接觸到更多的人。我希望我的作品不只能讓大家開心，也能鼓勵大家。</li>
<li>今年八月，我即將前往伯特利超自然學校（Bethel Supernatural School of Ministry，BSSM）學習。我深信在 BSSM 的時光，將幫助我變得更堅強、更自由。我也盼望，當我在基督裡越發成熟的同時，我的藝術創作也能一起成長，而我就能和你分享更多的故事。如果想知道我為什麼決定到 BSSM 讀書以及中間的過程，<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/notes/amymeowu/my-unexpected-journey-bssm/2793661117317174/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>請點此連結(英文版)</strong></a>。身為一個台裔貝里斯人，我拿的是學生簽證，在美國求學期間無法工作，因此我需要在離開貝里斯前募足所有求學資金，其中也包括生活費。</li>
</ol>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561004148/ndzlvlkslylq55fupmbw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>這項計畫所募集的資金，將在各方面帶給我幫助，包括圖畫的印刷及包裝、簽證申請、學費和生活開銷，以及在台灣及貝里斯配送產品。但對我而言，最有意義的並不只是錢，而是你透過支持這個計畫，鼓勵了身為藝術家的我。為此，我心中充滿感謝。希望我的創作和故事也激勵了你，成為你的祝福。</p>

<p>我挑選了12個主題/備忘錄，這些是我很喜歡的話語。然而，在忙碌的生活中，我們很容易遺忘。所以，我決定把他們放在年曆上，這樣就可以天天看到。</p>
<p>年曆中的角色包括橘橘，她最好的朋友浣熊艾比以及小老鼠莎凡娜。我也創造了灰狐狸、綠蜥蜴、海龜、以及貝里斯國鳥彩虹巨嘴鳥，這些都是生活在我成長的國家貝里斯的可愛動物。</p>

""out of the abundance of the heart, my art flows.”
To tell the story of Gi-gi, I must start from the year I took an interest in watercolors. Though I grew up in a very artistic family, I’ve never had any formal art trainings. So, every time I want to try something new, it still feels like a big challenge to me. I had no equipment or material, nor any money at that time to buy them. But I had a good determination, so I found an old box of watercolor pencil. “Ah-ha,” I thought, “this will work!” I took the pencil, shave them into dust, mixed them with water and created my own watercolor paste. 
I have a postcard featuring a painting of a family of foxes taped in front of my desk. It was something that I bought a few years ago, and something about that painting really touched my heart. But sometimes when I looked at it, it made me a little sad. I knew I loved the painting, but I also knew I don’t have the skill to paint something as beautiful. So I looked up a bunch of fox drawings on Google and Pinterest. I tried to copy and alternate the technique and styles. Then I practiced, but nothing came out too satisfying. My art just didn’t look as good as the others… Finally, I gave up on trying.
Giving up turns out to be one of the best things! Because that’s the moment when I decided to come up with something of my own. Something that represented me, and that is not confined by limitations. A huge head, small body, short limbs, and an oversized tail. Someone who didn’t look at the world the right-side up, and someone who won’t forget to smile. That was how the first painting of Gi-gi was born. 


I am starting this campaign for two reasons. 

I’ve always wanted to make my drawing into prints. This is my first attempt. It’s scary to me, but with your help I believe I can do it. This time I am only printing calendars and postcards. But one day I hope to have many products like wall arts, notebooks, children’s books…etc. By making my art into prints, you’ll help them reach a wider audience. My hope is that my work will not only brighten people’s days, but also be an encouragement to them.
I am going on my journey to study at Bethel Supernatural School of Ministry (BSSM) this August. I truly believe my time at BSSM will help me to become a stronger person and to live in greater freedom. I also hope that as I grow in Christ, my arts will also grow, and that I’ll be able to share even more stories with you. To read more about my journey to BSSM, please CLICK HERE. As a Taiwanese-Belizean I will not be able to work while on my student visa. Which means I’ll need to have all my school funding, including living expense available before I leave.


The money I raise will help me in so many ways. From printing and packaging, visa application, tuition and living expenses, to distribution of products at local stores in Taiwan and in Belize. But what meant the most to me is not just the money. By supporting this campaign you’ve encouraged me as an artist, and for that, I truly, deeply appreciate it. I also hope my art and my story has been an inspiration to you, and a blessing.
 



This project took me a while to complete. I knew I wanted to share Gi-gi with you, but throwing a bunch of cute drawing of Gi-gi together just won’t do. Gi-gi was created to be free and to inspire, so I knew it has to be something from my heart. 
I’ve put together 12 different theme/memo. These are words that I love, yet in this overwhelming life, we seem to easily forget. So, what better place to put these on, than a calendar that we’ll get to look at every day. 
The calendar includes Gi-gi, her best friend Abby, the raccoon, and Savanna, the mouse. I’ve also added the grey fox, the green iguana, the sea turtle, and Belize national bird, the keel-billed toucan, featuring a few of the lovely animals of Belize, where I grew up.
 



PDF 2020 Calendar - a download-able PDF calendar of 2020. Featuring 14 (12 month, + cover, + bonus page). The size is set as A4, so you can print them out or export them as single JPG for your laptop backgrounds. There will be no holidays marked on the calendar, so it can be used for any country or any culture.​

 

Tabletop Calendar - a Card Style, blank tabletop calendar measuring 13.7cm x 20.8cm. Packaged flat and the base can be folded into stand. Holding eight pieces of cards (printed front and back).  Blank Calendar is a flexible calendar with no dates or year, only Month and Weekdays. So, you can start using it anytime you want. Each month will have its drawing, and all you need to do is to pick up your phone or an existing calendar, and spend less than 5mins to fill in the dates.

 

Postcards - Six of the calendar painting, plus “The story of Gi-gi” painting (7 in total), will be made into postcards. So, you can share them with the people you love, frame them, or like me, tape them on your wall. Standard Size 10.5cm x 14.8cm. Seven in a set.

 

“The story of Gi-gi” painting - (Limited to 50 pieces) The original “The story of Gi-gi” watercolor painting repainted. Done on white watercolor paper, approx. 27.5cm x 19cm. Re-painted, numbered and signed by Amymeowu.

 

Watercolor Originals (Calendar collection) - (Limited to 12 pieces) One of the 12 original Calendar’s watercolor paintings. All 12 are different, so the one you pick will goes by a first come first served basis. Painted on warm (cream) watercolor paper. Approx. 27cm x 19.6cm. Signed by Amymeowu.

 

 

All printing will be done in Taiwan. I am aiming to print 500 copies or more on each one of the designs to bring down the printing cost. The original paintings are all done in Belize, where I am located. But I’ll be mailing the originals to Taiwan ahead of time. So both originals and prints can be packaged and mailed out directly from Taiwan.
Printing and Packaging will start immediately when the campaign ends. It should take no more than 20 working days to be ready for shipping. Shipment depends on what part of the world you’re located .
Since this campaign is made for both supporting the artwork and for supporting the artist’s schooling. The price is set for its purpose. In the future, extra printing will still be distributed to different shops for you to purchase. However, price will differ depending on the shop and its country.

 

This is my first crowdfunding project, I have carefully prepared everything to the littlest details before I launch this campaign. The paintings are done. The printing company is settled, and test prints has been made. So everything should go smoothly. But because this is my first crowdfunding project, I might have overlooked some details. If that happens and printing and shipping is delayed, please bear with me, and I’ll do my best to have it resolved as soon as possible. 
As for the part of your support that goes towards my schooling at BSSM, there is a risk of being rejected of my student visa. If unfortunately that happens, I will make good use of the money on creating more artworks, enroll in classes like digital painting, or purchasing materials. All funding will go towards my studio and not my personal use.
 

Once again thank you so much for your time and your support. I truly hope my story and art has inspired you and has brighten your day. 
Please help me to spread the word and SHARE this campaign with the world. 
If you feel lead to support me directly for BSSM. You can either help me toward my tuition by clicking HERE, or message me for further information. 
Don’t forget to find me on Facebook or Instagram @amymeowu for updates and more stories. Sincerely, Amy Wu

Special thanks to my family and friends who has supported me and helped me in this process. To my dear mom and dad, Arthur Wu (my brother), Jessica Lu (my cousin), Evelyne Wang, Rebecca Stirm, Viola Wu, Ada Wang, Sydney Peng and Jaclyn Peng. And all who have encouraged me and cheered me on along the way. I know I cannot have done it without you. Thank you so So much!!! Love Amy.

“橘橘”和她森林中的好朋友 

 

「我的藝術創作，源自於一顆豐沛的心。」
說到橘橘的故事，就必須從我開始對水彩感興趣那年說起。雖然我成長於一個藝術家庭，卻從來沒受過正式藝術訓練。所以每當我想嘗試新事物的時候，總覺得充滿挑戰。我沒有工具，也沒有材料，更沒有足夠買這些用品的經費，但是我意志堅定，找到一盒舊水彩色鉛筆，心想：「哈哈！這個可以用！」於是我拿起色鉛筆，削成粉末，與水混合，然後創造出自己的水彩顏料。
我的書桌前貼著一張明信片，上面畫著狐狸一家人。這張明信片是我在幾年前買的，上面的圖畫深深感動著我。不過，當我看著這幅畫時，偶爾會覺得難過。我知道自己喜歡畫畫，但也知道自己沒有足夠的繪畫技巧能畫出這麼美麗的畫面。所以我在 Google 和 Pinterest 找到許多狐狸的圖畫，試著模仿與改變繪畫技巧和風格，然後不停練習，但是成果都不太理想。我的作品就是比不過其他人的作品… 最後我放棄了。
沒想到，放棄模仿變成了最棒的一件事！因為那一刻，我決定用自己的風格，創造出代表自己的作品，一個不受各種框架侷限的作品：大大的頭、小小的身體、短短的四肢，還有一個超大的尾巴，這個狐狸會顛倒著看世界，而且絕不會忘記微笑，這就是橘橘誕生的過程。
 

開始這個集資計畫有兩個原因：

把作品印出來的想法一直在我心中，而這是我第一次付諸實行。對我而言這很恐怖，但有你的協助，我相信我做得到。這次我只會印製年曆和明信片，但希望未來可以印製更多的產品，例如牆面裝置藝術、筆記本、童書等。你的支持，將讓我的藝術作品接觸到更多的人。我希望我的作品不只能讓大家開心，也能鼓勵大家。
今年八月，我即將前往伯特利超自然學校（Bethel Supernatural School of Ministry，BSSM）學習。我深信在 BSSM 的時光，將幫助我變得更堅強、更自由。我也盼望，當我在基督裡越發成熟的同時，我的藝術創作也能一起成長，而我就能和你分享更多的故事。如果想知道我為什麼決定到 BSSM 讀書以及中間的過程，請點此連結(英文版)。身為一個台裔貝里斯人，我拿的是學生簽證，在美國求學期間無法工作，因此我需要在離開貝里斯前募足所有求學資金，其中也包括生活費。


這項計畫所募集的資金，將在各方面帶給我幫助，包括圖畫的印刷及包裝、簽證申請、學費和生活開銷，以及在台灣及貝里斯配送產品。但對我而言，最有意義的並不只是錢，而是你透過支持這個計畫，鼓勵了身為藝術家的我。為此，我心中充滿感謝。希望我的創作和故事也激勵了你，成為你的祝福。
 

我花了一些時間才完成這項計畫。我一直想和大家分享橘橘，但光是讓大家看許多可愛的圖畫是不夠的。我創作的橘橘是自由的，是能鼓勵人的，所以必須源自於我的心。
我挑選了12個主題/備忘錄，這些是我很喜歡的話語。然而，在忙碌的生活中，我們很容易遺忘。所以，我決定把他們放在年曆上，這樣就可以天天看到。
年曆中的角色包括橘橘，她最好的朋友浣熊艾比以及小老鼠莎凡娜。我也創造了灰狐狸、綠蜥蜴、海龜、以及貝里斯國鳥彩虹巨嘴鳥，這些都是生活在我成長的國家貝里斯的可愛動物。
 

附註：所有的印刷品及PDF下載檔內容一律為英文。

2020年曆（PDF版） - 2020 PDF版年曆供下載，裡面有14張圖畫（12個月+封面+其它），大小為A4，可列印或輸出成 jpg 電腦螢幕背景。年曆將不會標示假日，所以不管任何國家、文化都適用。

 

桌曆 – 13.7cm x 20.8cm 卡片式空白桌曆。平面包裝，紙底座可摺成底座，每套有8張卡片(正反面印刷)。空白桌曆沒有註記日期年份，只標示月份和星期，所以可以在任何時間開始使用。每個月份都有專屬的一張圖，使用者只需拿出手機或現有的年曆，不花五分鐘就可以填好日期。

 

明信片 – 六張年曆圖片，以及我所畫的第一張橘橘圖片將被製成明信片（總共七幅畫），讓你可以和所愛的人分享、表框，或是和我一樣，將他們貼在牆上。標準大小為10.5cm x 14.8cm，一組7張。

 

《橘橘的故事》 畫作 – （限量50張）一張《橘橘的故事》 水彩畫，紙張為白色水彩紙，大小約27.5cm x 19cm。重新繪製並標註限量序號，上有創作者 Amymeowu親筆簽名。

 

桌曆水彩原稿 -（限量12張）- 桌曆圖片的水彩原稿一張，每張都不同，先買先選。紙張為乳白色水彩紙，大小約 27cm x 19.6cm，上有創作者 Amymeowu親筆簽名。

 

附註：所有的印刷品及PDF下載檔內容一律為英文。


 

因為Indiegogo是個英文網頁，在此特別為講中文的朋友們重點翻譯購買的方式，希望能讓你們在使用上可以方便一點，若想瞭解網頁其他細節的內容，建議請會講英文的朋友協助你一起購買哦：
購買步驟：在右邊的小圖中選擇你喜歡的 “支持方式” （Select a Perk）滑鼠點選圖案後會展開詳細的資訊，確認購買內容後（若不確定購買內容，可以看上面“支持方式”的中文圖翻譯。那區的圖案是跟右邊的選項對稱的），請點選下面的  “選這個支持方式” （GET THIS PERK），網頁會帶你前往付款及填寫地址的頁面。

付款及填寫地址的頁面:


 

印刷將在台灣完成，我計畫每個設計都至少印500份，好降低印刷成本。所有的原稿都在貝里斯完成，也就是我現在居住的地方。但我會提早將原稿寄至台灣，所以原稿和印刷品都會直接從台灣包裝寄出。
集資活動一結束，就會開始印刷及包裝，最多不會超過20個工作天就可以出貨。運送時間將取決於你所選擇的收件地點。
由於這項集資活動的目的是要支持我的創作及求學所需，所以費用也照此定價。未來，這些作品也會在其他店鋪販售，但價格將依店家及國家有所不同。

 

這是我的第一個集資計畫，在公布這項計畫前，我已做好萬全的準備。畫作已經完成，我已和印刷公司談妥細節，試印樣品也已完成，所以一切應該都會順利進行。但因為這是我第一次集資，所以還是可能會有被我忽略的地方。若是因為這樣而造成印刷或送貨延遲，請多多包涵，我會盡全力在最快的時間內解決問題。
學生簽證的申請還是有被拒絕的可能，若不幸發生，我將會妥善使用原本將用於支持我在伯特利學院求學的經費，創作更多作品，參加數位繪畫課程，或用於材料選購。所有的資金都會用於我的工作室，不會用在個人開銷。
 

再次感謝你們的支持及時間。希望我的創作和故事也激勵了你，成為你的祝福。
也請你幫我把集資計畫的消息傳出去，分享給大家。
如果你有感動想要直接幫助我的BSSM求學資金，你可以點此連結到學費奉獻網，或是直接與我聯絡。
請別忘了在臉書或IG追蹤我（@amymeowu）。謝謝大家。

But don't worry, you don't need to have read the works of H.P. Lovecraft (or attended a small New England high school) to enjoy this series.

In issues 1-6, we learned that in the rustic hills of a small New England Berkshire town lies the prestigious Miskatonic High School.

We edited the track to fit our video.</p></div>","Welcome to Miskatonic High, the comic series about the monsters who reside in a small New England town and the students who ride the bus with them. Inspired by the works of H.P. Lovecraft, and skewered with our uniquely silly/sarcastic sense of humor, this is a series unlike anything you've read. But don't worry, you don't need to have read the works of H.P. Lovecraft (or attended a small New England high school) to enjoy this series. If you've ever dealt with any kind of monster (tentacled or not), this series is for you!The story so farWe successfully crowdfunded the first six issues, finishing our first season, and sold more than 5,000 comic books throughout the last year! And for some reason, our backers keep coming back for more (clearly high school left them as deranged as us)!Um... spoilers. In issues 1-6, we learned that in the rustic hills of a small New England Berkshire town lies the prestigious Miskatonic High School. When the Community Service Club went on a field trip, they were launched on a strange journey that birthed a terrible evil into our century (even worse than the toilet paper frenzy of last week)!Bonus storyWe've created an 8-page short story specifically for this collection! The story features two of our characters touring the town of Miskatonic at night with hints and suggestions about things to come. Reviews are inThe reviews for the whole series have been tremendous!Jenn Marshall of Sirens of Sequentials:“Miskatonic High is a fun story that balances everything you want in  a good horror story. There is some gore, but not so much that you get  overwhelmed. The jokes are funny, but they don’t make the story feel  like a parody of something else. It was well thought out, and I cannot  wait to see where it is going to go next.”“The monsters are very Lovecraftian. … Because they have that Lovecraftian feel to them, the monsters really are both written and drawn in a way that affected my Lizard Brain.” Read the full reviewThe Pullbox called it “the bastard lovechild of John Hughes & H.P. Lovecraft.” Here’s a bit from Paul’s review: “It brings a mismatched group of high schoolers together, throwing them against evil the likes of which you’d find in a dusty tome full of impossible to pronounce names. The beauty is in the execution. Despite some pretty heavy themes -- mounting madness, eternal torment, human sacrifice -- Mike Shea’s story stays fairly tongue in cheek. [Artist Ryan Mendoza] knows how to get his   Lovecraft on.” Read the full reviewMichael Logarta of Goshdarn Geeky said:""What better way to end the first season of Miskatonic High than with a bang—and by 'bang,' we mean a spectacular issue jam-packed with eldritch sorcery, tentacular delights, electric dance moves, voyages through space and time, daddy issues, mommy issues, friendship  issues, at least one perverted ghost, and more Lovecraftian weirdness than you can shake a questionably named cat at.""Overall, Miskatonic High #6: Monster’s Ball is a pleasure from start to finish, and a spectacular way to end the series’ first season."" Read the full reviewStretch goalsItems and variantsThe personalized metal bookmark measures 1.5"" by 4"" and features the Miskatonic High logo's tentacle to help you save your place in your favorite ancient tome. Each will be personalized with your name (we'll need you to respond to the survey within three days to get production going on these).We've got a few versions of our book: the 176-page softcover trade paperback (TPB) features all six issues, a new cover by Miskatonic High artist Ryan Mendoza, plus the 8-page bonus story! The 248-page hardcover features all six issues, a special Breakfast Club in Hell inspired cover, the bonus story, a variant cover gallery, the popular Teachers Lounge behind-the-scenes sections, a selection of Lovecraft stories and much more! The hardcover will also be offered in a limited bookplate version, signed and numbered by both writer Mike Shea and artist Ryan Mendoza.The vVurMzflessshhh Premium Edition features VENIEN's fully re-worked pulp version of the series in a disturbingly covered and oversized hardcover. This variant features the Gidim image on the cover and has an aged-black and white pulp appearance throughout. This edition is limited to 25 numbered copies and will never be reissued. It is also available in an exclusive Portfolio edition that includes the hardcover and a hardback folio case full of prints of VENIEN’s cover art and other extras. Limited to 25 ever and will never ever be reissued. PerksWe have more perks than you could shake your tentacle at (please don't though... that's the kind of thing that'll get you arrested): Add onsHere's what we have to offer:  LOVECRAFT P.I. imagines the macabre world of H.P. Lovecraft fused with noir detective novels of the 1920s and 1930s. In this occult world, ‘Ward’ Lovecraft serves as a Paranormal Investigator with the  Miskatonic Detective Agency. Short on temper and long on occult  knowledge, his unique talents are put to the test against an array of  fearsome creatures and villains.D.W. Kann has been a tremendous friend to us and there's a rumor we're working on a crossover between these two fun universes (does it count as only a rumor if we've already finished scripts and are starting to work on the artwork?). You can read more about these comics here. To help you discover these awesome comics and get up to date, we're offering both books as add-ons.

Lovecraft hade levt idag och bott i Uppsala! Hur hade hans berättelser sett ut då? Vår bok heter helt enkelt 1000 Ögon: Lovecraft och är vår hyllning till denna skräckens mästare. Vi tolkar några av hans berättelser och placerar dem i vårt 1000 Ögon-universum. Vi heter Daniel Thollin och Jonas Anderson och är bosatta i Uppsala. Jonas arbetar på heltid som frilansillustratör och gör barnböcker, grafisk formgivning och olika illustrationsuppdrag. Daniel är serietecknare och sjuksköterska. Daniel har tidigare arbetat på bl.a. Theos Ockulta Kuriositeter med Ola Skogäng och gjort The Evil Tree för det amerikanska serieförlaget Arcana. Seriebutiken Seriezonen i Uppsala firade 30 år som butik under 2010. Detta gav dem idén att ge ut en egen serietidning. De frågade oss om vi var intresserade att göra den. Resultatet blev 1000 Ögon: Tupilak. En 28-sidig tidning om Edgar och hans studentkompisar. Övernaturliga äventyr i ett Uppsala väldigt likt vårt eget. Tidningen släpptes på Kulturnatten samma höst och blev en succé. Det blev snart klart för oss att vi måste göra en fortsättning på Edgars äventyr. Detta ledde till att vi gav ut Hrafnir och Vondur under 2011. 2012 tog vi hjälp av våra serietecknarkompisar och gjorde Nyckeln. En antologitidning med en samling berättelser som cirklar kring en olycksbådande nyckel. När det var dags för 2013 års utgivning så ville vi göra något större. Vi bad författaren Anders Björkelid skriva ett 60-sidigt album som utspelar sig i det 1000 Ögon-universum som vi byggt upp under åren. Det blev Fylgia, en historia om identitet, Swedenborg och Uppsalahistoria. Den här gången var det Albumförlaget som gav ut den.När vi satte oss för att planera nästa 1000 ögon-berättelse stod det klart för oss att vi ville gå tillbaka till det som inspirerat oss. Den amerikanske skräckförfattaren Howard Phillips Lovecraft med sina noveller om uråldriga varelser som bara väntar på att åter ta över jorden. Lovecraft har inspirerat inte bara oss utan otaliga författare, filmmakare, konstnärer och inte minst serieskapare.1000 Ögon: Lovecraft ges ut av Albumförlaget, är 60 sidor lång och i traditionellt albumformat (21,5x29,5 cm). Daniel och Jonas skriver och tecknar två serier var denna gång. Boken består av fyra fristående berättelser. Skräckförfattaren Anders Fager (Samlade Svenska Kulter) har skrivit förordet till boken. Beräknad releasedag är 13 september 2014.Berättelserna som vi har baserat serierna i denna bok är Statement of Randolph Carter, The Hound, Shadow over Innsmouth och The Shunned House. Boken tar dig med ner i underjorden och ut bland fiskmonster vid Upplandskusten. Du möter giriga gravskändare samt en stackars student som får hyra ett hus hon skulle hållt sig borta från. Om du kan din Lovecraft så kommer du att känna igen berättelserna men se dem i ett nytt ljus. Om du aldrig tidigare hört talas om H.P. Lovecraft så har du fyra skräckhistorier att se fram emot. Rysliga saker som utspelar sig idag, i Sverige, kanske nära där du bor...Vår crowdfundingkampanj har flera syften. Först vill vi att vår bok ska nå ut till nya läsare.För det andra behöver vi frigöra tid. Att göra serier är extremt tidskrävande. Genom ert stöd via Indiegogo så kan vi prioritera detta projekt och se till att det blir så bra som vi verkligen vill och slippa stressa fram det mellan andra jobb.Du får möjlighet att köpa 1000 Ögon: Lovecraft direkt av oss utan mellanhänder, din bok blir signerad och du får den till ett schysst pris.Rek. butikspris är ca 229:- och vi tar ca. 230:- inkl frakt för boken!Vi skickar böckerna så att du får dom snarast efter releasen den 13/9.  Förutom detta så erbjuder vi flera “rewards” med bonusar såsom orginalteckningar och liknande som är unika endast för denna kampanj.

<p><span><strong>He lives!</strong></span></p>
<p><span>We are creating the world's first new/old superhero. Why? Because we got tired of our own complaining. Every time a new Spiderman comes out, or a new Batman we re-visit the same old argument - where are the new legends? The new myths? So we decided to create one. He's called Electric Man and the first issue will be out in October. Why Electric Man. We're glad you asked...<br/></span></p>
<p> In 2011 we made a movie about  comic books and the people who love them. It’s a film about a rare and valuable first issue that gets stolen and is pursued by various characters who all want it for their own reasons. <br/></p>
<p> Even though he was only ever supposed to be created for the film, people have been drawing him and asking about a ‘real’ Electric Man comic.   Electric Man has taken on a life of his own and we don't want to stop him. So now he has his own website <a href=""http://www.electricmancomic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.electricmancomic.com</a></p>
<p>Writer Scott Mackay and artist Graham Manley are currently slaving away on the first issue as a labour of love. That first issue forms the foundation of a much larger tale - a story spanning decades and using the full potential of Electric Man's history. This iconic first issue will be available in October but how easily it is to get hold of depends on you.<br/></p>
<p> You can help Electric Man. We will print the first issue come what may - that's guaranteed. We are asking you to help us take it further; To help us put Electric Man in your local comic book store.</p>
<p></p>Just by pre-ordering your comic, or by buying a limited edition artwork you are ensuring a future for Electric Man. Who knows? You might even be saving the world.<br/><p>The creators are Scott Mackay - the guy who wrote the movie and created Electric Man in the first place. Scott generally writes comics for the European market. Graham Manley the man responsible for the origin that you saw in the video. He's worked for 2000AD and a list of others too long for this page. Colouring will be by Jamie Grant - All Star Superman and another list of credits as long as your arm.</p>
<p>An initial three issue arc is planned and a world of discovery awaits beyond those.<br/></p>
<p> Jump aboard, catch the buzz.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>First of all we need to create the comic and just as we did on Electric Man we intend to pay people for their creativity.</p>
<p> 
Please contribute if you can but if you can't it doesn't matter. Of course you can use the share tools, or talk about it in your local comic store. Mention it to your friends, tweet about it - all of this stuff helps immensely. But you can also draw a picture, or get to work on that script. Electric Man is coming - why not join the ride?</p>
<p>As mentioned above the writer and artists are currently working for free. We'd like to pay them a little something to put this on a sustainable basis. So that Electric Man can be depended upon month after month. $5,000 over three issues.</p>
<p>Paper and Ink - Actually this is essential - we hope to cover the printing costs so that issue 2 is also guaranteed. But this helps with issue 1 and getting it into your local comic book store. $3,000</p>
<p>Getting it out to you - we guarantee to deliver your pre-ordered comic or art to your door and that means postage. Budgeting a dollar per = $1,000 <br/></p>
<p>The community website - where the Electric Man writers and artists (that's you) gather to discuss plot lines, villains and so on. We're not just creating a comic book here, we're creating a community filled with artists and writers and fans. <br/></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.electricmancomic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.electricmancomic.com</a> needs to be bigger so that we can all get involved. $1,000<br/></p>
<p> </p>
AND WHAT DO YOU GET?<br/><br/>Well, the perks are lovely. The art is gorgeous and you get a fresh superhero on the block but we will also make you a part of it. Anyone (and we mean that) who contributes to Electric Man gets their name in the first issue. We are setting aside pages just to thank you. This is limited to the first issue - Electric Man will appear in your local comic store and when people pick it up to ask if you've read it all you have to do is smile and say 'Read it? I'm in it.'<br/><p>
</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With your help we can create a legend. A new myth to stand beside the others. Check out the website and see how you can become involved in the creation of the comics from the ground up. We'll have eighty years of back story to fill in - and just as we said on the video, we're going to need help.<br/></p>
<p>We made an indie movie about this comic and that movie goes global this coming fall. Check it out on youtube/IMDB or on our page <a href=""http://www.electricmanmovie.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.electricmanmovie.com</a>. Every journey begins with a first step. This is the first step towards a career in comics for some and for those who just want to read or watch this is the first step towards a glorious moment in the future -when you sit down and open a comic and you can say 'I was part of that'.</p>

Scrimshaw was picked up for distribution by <a href=""http://www.alternacomics.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Alterna Comics</a>. This is great because it will open up the potential for  expanding the audience of a project we're very passionate about. Our deal with them is for digital distribution with an opportunity to print a collected graphic novel every third issue for distribution to comic shops nationwide. But this opportunity will be based on performance and how well our little story does out there in the big, bad world. </p><h4>That's where you, the readers who helped us get this thing off the ground, as well as the ones joining us right now, come in. </h4><div><br/></div><div>Issue #2 is already in production. In fact here's a look at the first page: </div><div><br/></div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461268494/scrim2pg1_mivxhk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Who doesn't want more of that?  </p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Where Does the Money Go?</h3>
<p>Now we're launching this campaign for just one reason. So that we can print Issue #2.  We established the $4400 goal for a couple of reasons. </p>
<p>Reason #1 - $4400 allows us to print enough comics that we can fulfill our Issue #2 promise to our awesome readers and still have enough to sell at our next Comic Con. These sales allow us to go to work on Issue #3. </p>
<p>Reason #2 - $4400 is in the ballpark of what our first printed distribution run with Alterna might cost and we want to show them we can hit that number even before digital distribution in September. Our goal is to get Scrimshaw on those comic store shelves for everyone to read.</p>
<p>(I say ballpark because Indiegogo does take a small % for facilitating our mission.) </p>
<p>Now this is where the beauty of Indiegogo becomes clear. Since this is a flexible funding campaign even if we don't hit our goal, we're going to put what we do raise to work, which means you will get Issue #2 in your hands regardless. That's the point of our whole campaign, to get the book to readers and be able to continue telling the story. Plain and Simple, right?</p>
<h3>What Do We Get?  </h3>
<div>Since this campaign is essentially a pre-sale for Issue #2, we're offering perks to get Scrimshaw in as many hands as possible and help put you in touch with the world and the characters. </div>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<div>Still with us? Great because this is the most important part of Scrimshaw, the message. Scrimshaw is about the where our world could be headed.  It tells the story of a possible future. One in which the world has been affected by the effects of global warming, genetic and agricultural manipulation, and all-out war between the so-called superpowers.  While it’s a fantasy adventure with a diverse cast of characters, it is also firmly rooted in the real. Issues like global warming, overfishing of the oceans, corporate exploitation, political over-reach, and race relations are tackled head-on. The story also revolves around one of the oldest and most maligned traits that mankind possesses, our ability to make war. Scrimshaw imagines a future that could become very real given the current state of affairs in our world. </div>
<div>It's our hope that this little story might spark in someone the wish to ask why? And that maybe in asking the question the answer brings them to a place where they can aid the change that the world so desperately needs. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<h4>Risks and Challenges</h4>
<div>Luckily this isn't the first comic book for any of us. We've been up the mountain before. Still there are challenges with bringing any artistic endeavor into being. We're confident that barring any unforeseen circumstances or swift and mighty deathblows to the team, we can  deliver Scrimshaw Issue #2 in all it's glory in June of 2016. Not coincidentally that's when we plan on going to Amazing Las Vegas Comic-Con, so the book better be finished. <br/>

Scrimshaw was picked up for distribution by Alterna Comics. This is great because it will open up the potential for  expanding the audience of a project we're very passionate about. Our deal with them is for digital distribution with an opportunity to print a collected graphic novel every third issue for distribution to comic shops nationwide. But this opportunity will be based on performance and how well our little story does out there in the big, bad world. That's where you, the readers who helped us get this thing off the ground, as well as the ones joining us right now, come in. Issue #2 is already in production. In fact here's a look at the first page: 

Who doesn't want more of that?  

Where Does the Money Go?
Now we're launching this campaign for just one reason. So that we can print Issue #2.  We established the $4400 goal for a couple of reasons. 
Reason #1 - $4400 allows us to print enough comics that we can fulfill our Issue #2 promise to our awesome readers and still have enough to sell at our next Comic Con. These sales allow us to go to work on Issue #3. 
Reason #2 - $4400 is in the ballpark of what our first printed distribution run with Alterna might cost and we want to show them we can hit that number even before digital distribution in September. Our goal is to get Scrimshaw on those comic store shelves for everyone to read.
(I say ballpark because Indiegogo does take a small % for facilitating our mission.) 
Now this is where the beauty of Indiegogo becomes clear. Since this is a flexible funding campaign even if we don't hit our goal, we're going to put what we do raise to work, which means you will get Issue #2 in your hands regardless. That's the point of our whole campaign, to get the book to readers and be able to continue telling the story. Plain and Simple, right?
What Do We Get?  
Since this campaign is essentially a pre-sale for Issue #2, we're offering perks to get Scrimshaw in as many hands as possible and help put you in touch with the world and the characters. 
The Impact
Still with us? Great because this is the most important part of Scrimshaw, the message. Scrimshaw is about the where our world could be headed.  It tells the story of a possible future. One in which the world has been affected by the effects of global warming, genetic and agricultural manipulation, and all-out war between the so-called superpowers.  While it’s a fantasy adventure with a diverse cast of characters, it is also firmly rooted in the real. Issues like global warming, overfishing of the oceans, corporate exploitation, political over-reach, and race relations are tackled head-on. The story also revolves around one of the oldest and most maligned traits that mankind possesses, our ability to make war. Scrimshaw imagines a future that could become very real given the current state of affairs in our world. 
It's our hope that this little story might spark in someone the wish to ask why? And that maybe in asking the question the answer brings them to a place where they can aid the change that the world so desperately needs. 

Risks and Challenges
Luckily this isn't the first comic book for any of us. We've been up the mountain before. Still there are challenges with bringing any artistic endeavor into being. We're confident that barring any unforeseen circumstances or swift and mighty deathblows to the team, we can  deliver Scrimshaw Issue #2 in all it's glory in June of 2016. Not coincidentally that's when we plan on going to Amazing Las Vegas Comic-Con, so the book better be finished.",11.0,0,"3 Campaigns

We are enthusiastic about this comic because here, in Mexico, graphic novels are scarce things. So, we really hope make the difference and inspire other young artists from Mexico and Latinamerica to start this type of projects.</div><div>Your contribution will be very important for us, to continue working and share whit all of you the results. The last time we made a Crowfunding we fail in our economic goal, but we obtained not only experience, also we met great people that until now follow this project. We also have nice surprises for our founders of our firts try in Indiegogo. So, go ahead, be part of our band!!!<br/><p><br/></p>

</div><div>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The principal obstacle is the time/cost balance production. If we have less resources, we should give more time to other gainful activities and the finish dead line of Ana Zeppelin is more far away.</span>
<p>We are patient and steadfast,but if you are part of this project it will be more easy. The next five months the team will be work on drawing and publish the second part of Ana Zeppelin. For the last, we find a small house in the country side of Mexico to live and draw. We are sure togheter we can make our goal.</p>

</div></div>","Who we are?
 
Hi everyone, we are Caperuza Roja, a group of young graphic artist who make comic projects. We started Ana Zeppelin four years ago. Until now we made 176 pages, six chapters, that comprising the Part 1 of the story. Here you can read/download by free the first part of Ana Zeppelin... yeap, by free!https://medibang.com/book/4z1603201326096340000650846The band is made up by:





Our master draw or first pencil is Miyo. She’s is the expert of the group for drawing. With more than fifteen years of experience, she can presume she worked for the best on Japan like the legendary SNK Corporation. But now, we convinced her to take long holydays on the Indie way production environment.








Pável Kenika is another master of drawing. He is our inker and also have another personal comic projects. He worked with Edgar Clement, one of the main characters of the comic industry at Mexico. He's still young, an artist whit a brilliant future.







Any. She helps us with the digital edition and corrections of the scanning pages.  Her work is important for get a detailed quality on the final document.




We also receive help from other professionals like Adaliza Zárate in translation and covers, DanielTenorio as inker or Valente Espinoza as our internet shaman.


What is Ana Zeppelin?
Is our first graphic novel. Ana Zeppelin is the story about a 13 years old girl who lives at Mexico City in the beginning of the nineteen’s. Her traditional and childish life style changes when she listens for first time the rock grunge music. Since then, she tries to learn to play rock music and starting to make her own songs in the middle of bullying and classist teenager environment.

Rock music is one of the central topics of the novel. We mention, literal or with graphic tributes, mostly of our favorite bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Pixies, Sonic Youth, Led Zeppelin, The Doors, David Bowie, The Beatles, Rolling Stones, Elvis and many more.

The novel has 21 chapters. We already finish, complete in spanish and english, 6 of it. The last means 167 pages. The aim is finish the next six chapters on September 2016. At Spanish an English version. We of estimate the total number of pages on more than 150. Like you could see is a huge work to do. The novel is made by traditional techniques: pencil, ink and paper. But also, we try to use the new technologies like sophisticate software for comic manufacturing and draw edition.


The Characters

Ana. She ir the main character. The story started whit her when she has 13 years old. In the II Part  she pass from be the popular between her rich partners to meet new people at the popular low class.


Ana have a cool uncle, Armando. He is the principal Ana's mentor for rock'n roll and ethical guide. The story of Armando is complex and includes revolutionary incursions, communist ideas and tragic situations. By the way, he is a master playing guitar:

The Ana's rock band is formed by Jafet (first guitar), Saul (second guitar), Julio (bass) and Tomas (drums).

The girldfriends of the members of the band are also important at the story, specially Mercedes. She teach Ana how to dress and survive at the dangerous jungle of the rich guys highschool.


At the part two, another important characters start to play a principal rol, like Alberto (Ana's boyfriend) or Lola (guitar of Ana's new band).

Why we need funding???
Publish comics implies hard work, constancy and resources. We need funding to continue our work and crowdfunding represents a useful alternative scheme. The money you invest will be use in the following way:

As you can see, the funding is not only a direct benefit four us, we also use the funds to pay the job of our external contributors. Moreover, we are planning to invite ten young comic artist to make chapter covers and Ana Zeppelin fan art that will be include in the Part II.
If we cannot arrive to our goal, the funds obtained will be priority used for the rewards and production.

The impact

We are enthusiastic about this comic because here, in Mexico, graphic novels are scarce things. So, we really hope make the difference and inspire other young artists from Mexico and Latinamerica to start this type of projects.Your contribution will be very important for us, to continue working and share whit all of you the results. The last time we made a Crowfunding we fail in our economic goal, but we obtained not only experience, also we met great people that until now follow this project. We also have nice surprises for our founders of our firts try in Indiegogo. So, go ahead, be part of our band!!!
Risks and challenges

The principal obstacle is the time/cost balance production. If we have less resources, we should give more time to other gainful activities and the finish dead line of Ana Zeppelin is more far away.
We are patient and steadfast,but if you are part of this project it will be more easy. The next five months the team will be work on drawing and publish the second part of Ana Zeppelin. For the last, we find a small house in the country side of Mexico to live and draw. We are sure togheter we can make our goal.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Jeff, I am a father of twins, a pastor, and a student of philosophy and theology in Mississauga, Ontario, and I have been drawing comics for as long as I could remember. For the past two years (shortly after my kids were born) I've been drawing Two by Two, which is a mostly true account of what it's like to raise twins while going to school and working full time. It's a hectic life, but it's our life, and it's usually hilarious.</p>
<p>I am putting together a book of 100 comic strips and selected blogs from my website, as well as some sketches I've done in my spare time. The book will be full colour and will hopefully be available in March if this campaign is successful.</p>
<p>My comic strip appeals to a wide range of people but has often been said to be encouraging to new parents and parents of multiples in particular.  This book would not only be a huge milestone in my life and something off my bucket list, but would also be a great gift for a number of people were it availabe in print.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am raising $6000 to print a run of 300 books to sell online and at different comic/art shows. All the donations we get will go directly to the cost of printing and promoting the book. I have received various quotes from different companies, but will be printing through Sure Print and Design in Toronto, ON. Approx. $5300 will go towards the printing and the rest will go towards the indie go go fee and a facebook ad campaign promoting the book.</p>
<p>For your donation you will receive any number of prizes and perks spanning from a thumbs up, original artwork, and a fancy dinner.  Check out the perks section to see what strikes your fancy.</p>
<p>On the off chance that I do not raise all the funds needed to do a run of 300 I will do a shorter run of books to ensure that everyone who has ordered one will receive one and so there is little to no risk of donating! On the chance that I do not raise enough to print any books, those who ordered books will receive a digital copy of the book, an apology, and some original artwork signed by me.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
As I said before this is a huge bucket list item for me.  It's also a great gift idea for new parents and parents of multiples. While this comic is unlikely to make any significant medical or engineering breakthroughs, or be responsible for any other world/paradigm altering discoveries, it's a great way to spread some joy in the world, and I think we can all agree there is not enough joy.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
Even if you can't donate you can still be a huge help!  The key to this campaign's success is people hearing about it! Please tell your friends about it, post it on your facebooks, twitters, instagrams, and what have you.  And check out the Indie Go Go info sharing options!  Thanks so much for your help!</div></div>","Short Summary

About name Eisen blume 
 
This name came from German language mean 'iron flower'
I would like to present something that have strong feel of masculine
and delicate feel of feminine so I combine two word that seem in opposite thing.
Iron is mineral which represent strong feel.On the contrary flower is something more fragile,like woman that need someone to protect.
 
In real life,my personality is kind of mixing between two gender,
because I'm in middle between my brother and sister.I take dad as my role model and my mom always beside me,
So I've personality of men and woman in the sametimes,
I may work hard and my dream similar to man dream,but I'm sensitive inside.So it's became name of this artbook.
 
and it's involve with my style also.I like style that you didn't know man or woman draw it or it's hard to know gender of artist who draw it.So I try to take that route for a long time.I try more unisex approach.You may see in some picture in this artbook I try to use western style combine with manga which is oriental.I think western represent strong style of masculine but oriental is delicate feel of feminine like Yin-Yang which law of nature that have harmony.Because of something opposite that can make this world can move in balance way.It's like my root from landscape architecture faculty,nature and building that have contrast in context but as designer you have to making it going well together.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a second year UVic student in the Visual Arts Department working towards a career as a graphic novelist. </p>
<p>I would really love to start my career by publishing a little more informally, and moreso for myself than profit. I have a lot of plans for future comics, but those are still on the back burner. A lot of comic artists start off with short stories, so I figured it would be a fun thing to try.</p>
<p>With your help, I will be able to start my career and portfolio so that when I graduate I will have a published book under my belt as well as fundraising skills.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I set the goal as $1500. This funds the set up for LightningSource, ISBN, and the espresso book machine ($500), then copies of the comic ($900), supplies ($75), and misc expenses/perks ($25)</p>
<p>If you donate...</p>
<p>$1 - Good Karma and a thank you email!<br/>$5 - Your name in the thank you section of the book, plus all previous perks.<br/>$30 - A drawing signed and emailed to you, plus all previous perks.<br/>$100 - A signed copy of the book, plus all previous perks.</p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal, I will put towards as much money as I can to pay for copies of the book. If I make less than $500, then I will have to do LightningSource setup and whatnot on my own, using whatever I can make to get the espresso machine set up and a few copies of the book.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My project will hopefully be something new and interesting that people will feel frightened by, weirded out, or just plain confused. I want to create a world to immerse readers and get people a little out of their comfort zone.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

This project was created to help educate and explain what Multiple Sclerosis is for young adults, youth, and anyone else wanting more information on this debilitating, and sometimes confusing disease. We wanted to make something visual, with a storyline, and came up with illustrating in a graphic novel format.

I'm John Medeiros, a writer and graphic designer. I have also been creative director of other graphic novels, worked on websites, new media, journalism and parenting. I also have Multiple Sclerosis. I was diagnosed 10 years ago and spent a lot of time researching what MS is all about, and to be honest it would have been nice to have something in a story form to educate me. It's just how I like to learn. So, I decided to write a story and get some great illustrators on board to create this graphic novel.




Synopsis
 The story is written from the point of view of Sarah, an 18 yr old young woman living in a mid sized city. Sarah woke up one morning with numbness in her lower limbs, and as the days went by the numbness spread to other parts of her body, along with other uncomfortable symptoms such as a crushing tightness to her chest.
The story then follows the journey from all the tests one goes through for a diagnosis, some very unpleasant such as the dreaded Lumbar Puncture (Spinal Tap) and what MS is all about and the implications of having the disease in different stages.
The text is written, fact checked and ready to go.






  The Impact Between 2 and 3 million people a year are affected globally with Multiple Sclerosis, with a higher percentage growing each year in younger people from 14-21. There is no definitive reason why it happens. There is no cure.
The graphic novel is an honest and open story about what can happen and helps someone going through the symptoms, or friends and family, understand what a person living with the disease goes through to be diagnosed, and how it can affect their lives on a daily basis. It is written in a way that is easy to understand and helps explain the sometimes complex information available, in a way that everyone can learn from.

We have kept the perks simple and easy to choose from. The option is also there to donate without a perk, but always with our gratitude. 

  Risks & Challenges  If the full funding doesn't happen here, we will use what is available to develop as much of the graphic novel as possible in the hopes to use the updated material to obtain finishing costs for the project from other funding agencies and/or companies.

<h3>Hi!</h3>
<p>My name is Ryan Smith, the cartoonist behind Accursed Dragon. It's a fantasy series that follows an ongoing storyline, but I try to keep it fun and full of adventure! A couple years ago I had Volume 1 printed, which contains the first three stories.  Now it's time to print the second book and hopefully with your help!</p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>The Printing</h3>
<p>The plan is to print 1,500 softcover copies of Volume 2.  To help compensate for the cost of printing, our ultimate goal is to reach $5,000.  That is an awful lot and I hope to compensate you for any contributions by giving you a quality book in exchange.</p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>The Incentives</h3>
<p>It's very simple! By donating $25, BANG! You get a copy of the freshly printed Accursed Dragon Volume 2 mailed to you (with a thank you and a doodle inside).  I like to provide you with more, however!</p>
<ul>
<li>Donate $35 or more and you get a Volume 1 to accompany your Volume 2.  Already have a copy? Well, think of how much friends and family would like to own it.  :D</li>
<li>Cameo opportunities!  A chance to be in the comics and socialize with the characters, depending on the perk you pick.</li>
<li>I don't expect people to leap over themselves for a commission from me, but this is your best chance to get one. Anything-ANYTHING-you want and I'll draw it for you.</li>

<p>Just for fun I'll also put some bonus incentives on the website. Considering summer will be upon us in a few months, for every $500 reached I'll draw a character pinup pic.  Humpbrett is first because...well, I can't very well put the most popular characters at the lowest tier now can I?  ;D</p>
<p>The higher we get, the more revealing the pinups!</p>
<p>If we go beyond $5,000 I guess things will get a bit NSFW.  :x</p>
<p>If stretch goals become necessary, I'll come up with more merchandise to include with the books (collectible pins, shirts, etc.).  No sense worry about that until we need to, though.</p>

The weekly cartoon for Wings Over Scotland has charted an exhilarating period in our history. Now, and by popular demand (no, really) I've compiled the choicest of the choice from Wings and other publications for a book no evil separatist should be without.<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Offer</h3> <p></p>Welcome to Cairnstoon features cartoons from the beginning of the Indyref campaign all the way through to the summer of 2015 and the tumultuous aftermath of arguably the most important General Election in post-war history. Over 160 pages of cartoons and caustic comment, it recalls the highs and lows of Scotland's odyssey in search of independence.<br/><br/>Remember all our pals from Project Fear? There's Dr Doom Darling, Car Crash Interview Lamont, Pants on Fire McDougall and many more. Also featuring are the Eton Old Boys Club now running the country, feckless Lib Dems and a supine Labour Party behaving like Indecisive Dave from The Fast Show – agreeing with whatever the last person said to them down the pub. And, throughout, we have the enduring double act illustrating the shifting tides of relations between a Westminster-dominated UK and Scotland – John Bull and our very own Scottish lion, Hamish.<br/><br/>Printed in full colour throughout on matt coated art paper with a gloss laminated cover, Welcome to Cairnstoon is 24cm x 24cm (9.5"" x 9.5"") and comes in soft and hard back versions.<br/><br/>There is a foreword by leading commentator and Observer columnist Kevin McKenna and an introduction by Rev Stuart Campbell, editor of Wings Over Scotland. I've cut out the bits that weren't about me.<br/><br/>I'm offering five levels of perks for contributors eager to get their hands on a signed and numbered first edition copy in either hard or soft cover with lots of goodies – prints and badges – many featuring Hamish.<br/>
</div><br/> <div> <h3>What is Needed</h3> <p> </p>The book – soft and hard cover – is being published by Greg Moodie and will be printed in Scotland by Bell &amp; Bain Ltd (producers of such modern classics as Greg Moodie Versus The Union and Reeds Nautical Almanac). We are looking for £7,500 to cover the cost of this plus postage and packaging.<br/><br/><h3>Interesting Times</h3>

Thank you.<p></p></div>","Summary It has been rich pickings for a cartoonist in Scotland over the last few years and I've helped myself liberally. The weekly cartoon for Wings Over Scotland has charted an exhilarating period in our history. Now, and by popular demand (no, really) I've compiled the choicest of the choice from Wings and other publications for a book no evil separatist should be without.   The Offer Welcome to Cairnstoon features cartoons from the beginning of the Indyref campaign all the way through to the summer of 2015 and the tumultuous aftermath of arguably the most important General Election in post-war history. Over 160 pages of cartoons and caustic comment, it recalls the highs and lows of Scotland's odyssey in search of independence.Remember all our pals from Project Fear? There's Dr Doom Darling, Car Crash Interview Lamont, Pants on Fire McDougall and many more. Also featuring are the Eton Old Boys Club now running the country, feckless Lib Dems and a supine Labour Party behaving like Indecisive Dave from The Fast Show – agreeing with whatever the last person said to them down the pub. And, throughout, we have the enduring double act illustrating the shifting tides of relations between a Westminster-dominated UK and Scotland – John Bull and our very own Scottish lion, Hamish.Printed in full colour throughout on matt coated art paper with a gloss laminated cover, Welcome to Cairnstoon is 24cm x 24cm (9.5"" x 9.5"") and comes in soft and hard back versions.There is a foreword by leading commentator and Observer columnist Kevin McKenna and an introduction by Rev Stuart Campbell, editor of Wings Over Scotland. I've cut out the bits that weren't about me.I'm offering five levels of perks for contributors eager to get their hands on a signed and numbered first edition copy in either hard or soft cover with lots of goodies – prints and badges – many featuring Hamish.
  What is Needed  The book – soft and hard cover – is being published by Greg Moodie and will be printed in Scotland by Bell & Bain Ltd (producers of such modern classics as Greg Moodie Versus The Union and Reeds Nautical Almanac). We are looking for £7,500 to cover the cost of this plus postage and packaging.Interesting Times

<h3>BP3: Cypress the First Bubba</h3>
<p>This is the third issue of the Bubba Patrol series. The comic book is about my dogs as super heroes and is the legacy to show the world how I see them everyday. BP3 tells the origin story of the very first Bubba, Cypress and tells the story of how she went from unwanted runt of the litter to full fledged legendary super hero. There shall come a Bubba. Her name is Cypress, and the Antiheroverse will never be the same.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Campaign Goals and What Backers Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>The initial goal of this project is $700. This will allow me to print 700 copies of the Bubba Patrol issue 3 and pay my editor and guest pinup artists.</li>
<li>You're going to get the full color issue on newsprint just like comics were when I began collecting. There are perks that will get you ""reBARKED"" and signed covers where I will sketch a remark on the cover, a limited sketch cover option to have a special edition of the book with a full color sketch from me. If you missed the first two issues have no fear the Bubbas are also here to give you the whole story so far. There will also be options for retailers. There will be several stretch goals including a variant cover painted by the amazing Vic Hollins, a trading card set and more.</li>
<li>This is a flexible funded campaign. If we don't reach the first goal, the money raised will go towards the printing of the book and some extra, out of the box, funding options will begin to take place.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why should you back this project?</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Bubba Patrol is the most important series I have ever worked on. It is both the most personal and best project I could ever hope to work on. These dogs aren't just characters, they are my dogs and my family. This issue gives Cypress her legacy and shows the world why she and the rest of the Bubbas are so very important to me.</li>
<li>Comic books should be fun. And The Bubba Patrol makes people smile, laugh and it has captured fans both young and old. The Bubba Patrol is quick and fun read but always has tons of Easter eggs included. At age 4, my nephew looked through the pictures with me and was cracking up as he followed the story.</li>
<li>I have run 3 crowd funding campaigns for the Bubba Patrol issues 1 and 2 and for the Bubba Files last year (my first campaign on Indiegogo). Each project has been funded, although the Bubba Files took a bit of those outside of the box funding ideas.</li>
<li>This project, like so many others, doesn't happen without crowd and fan support. For years I have produced comics while going into debt when printing them. The Bubba Patrol project has resonated best with my readers and fans and through some unique practices fans get to be able to say, ""I helped make this creator's vision and dream become reality.""</li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>All projects have risks and challenges. All the major challenges with this project have already occurred. In January I lost all of the files when I was just two pages away from completing the line art when my portable hard drive fell and broke. One page was still open when those files were lost and I slowly began to recreate and improve upon the original 32 page script. In February, Foley was diagnosed with cancer. This made working on the book even harder, but made the final product even more important. The task of having to redo the whole book challenged me to make the book even better, adding some fun scenes with the appearance of several friends and give Foley his special moment. The challenge also has to do with making sure this book is completed and in had before I have to say goodbye to Foley.</p>
<ul>
<li>As of the start of this campaign I have very little to do to finish. There are less than 3 pages to color and the cover, which I already have the concept for.</li>
<li>Time management is key, but there is not much left to do. In order to make this book the absolute best it can be I am going to be steady but deliberate in these last few parts.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand that not everyone (especially right now) has the funds to support this campaign. And if you can't, I ask that you share the story, tweet it, post it on Facebook, or tell your comic book loving, fur family friends about it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Every dollar counts towards the end goal of printing this comic book. If you can contribute, please do.</li>
<li>Once you've backed the campaign, please remember to tell others why you backed the Bubba Patrol issue 3. Using the Indiegogo share tools is very quick and easy.</li>
