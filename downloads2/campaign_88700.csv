<p>We believe strongly that technology needs to advance. For the past few years we have seen software advancing, however the hardware advancements have hit a brick wall.

<p>Gamers and CAD designers alike have been complaining for quite some time now about issues with ""screen lag"" and other video issues due to graphics cards which are not able to keep up. This Multi-Processor system allows all processors to work in tandem to remove these issues. Offering higher frame rates and more processing power than standard desktop systems, the Slice can supersede it all!<br/></p>

<p>SmartPhoto Case is here to revolutionize mobile photography. Innovative SmartPhoto Case is a patented combination of filters and LED flash designed to eliminate unwanted glare and flash reflections, bringing out a crystal clear image with increased contrast and definition.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://smartphotocase.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Before-After.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The problem and the solution</strong></h3>
<p>When tattoo artists, influencers, bloggers and artists alike try to photograph their works, friends or items of interest quite often they meet the problem of their pictures not meeting their expectations.</p>
<p>When a subject is photographed or filmed with flash the resulting material contains reflections, glares and its contrast and color saturation are reduced. The picture just doesn't look good.</p>
<p>To mitigate this problem artists resort to complex and expensive studio photography setups with led lights, filters, uncomfortable rigs, cables and sync devices.</p>
<p>SmartPhoto Case is a simple but revolutionary device that reduces all those sophisticated solutions down to a smartphone case. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://smartphotocase.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bag-o.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>No more expensive setups, heavy cameras and specialized software are needed! All you need is our case, a smartphone and a dark room. It is simple as that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SmartPhoto Case comes with a host of features that will help you take that perfect shot.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597259937/atzqfppxkmuxyaw8kjqq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>The case will be made of a sturdy ABS material and filters will be covered by Gorilla glass to protect them from accidental scratches.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>How it works?</strong></h3>
<p>The <strong>highlight feature </strong>of SmartPhoto Case is the ability to reduce or completely remove LED flash reflections.</p>
<p>For the best results, your photographed <strong>subject should be in a dark room</strong> or in a place where there are no other direct light sources reflecting on the photographed surface.</p>
<p>Use SmartPhoto Case to<strong> illuminate the subject</strong> and its built-in <strong>filters will completely remove the unwanted reflections</strong> from the photographed object.</p>

</div></div>","SmartPhoto Case is here to revolutionize mobile photography. Innovative SmartPhoto Case is a patented combination of filters and LED flash designed to eliminate unwanted glare and flash reflections, bringing out a crystal clear image with increased contrast and definition.

 
The problem and the solution
When tattoo artists, influencers, bloggers and artists alike try to photograph their works, friends or items of interest quite often they meet the problem of their pictures not meeting their expectations.
When a subject is photographed or filmed with flash the resulting material contains reflections, glares and its contrast and color saturation are reduced. The picture just doesn't look good.
To mitigate this problem artists resort to complex and expensive studio photography setups with led lights, filters, uncomfortable rigs, cables and sync devices.
SmartPhoto Case is a simple but revolutionary device that reduces all those sophisticated solutions down to a smartphone case. 

No more expensive setups, heavy cameras and specialized software are needed! All you need is our case, a smartphone and a dark room. It is simple as that.
 
SmartPhoto Case comes with a host of features that will help you take that perfect shot.

The case will be made of a sturdy ABS material and filters will be covered by Gorilla glass to protect them from accidental scratches.
 
How it works?
The highlight feature of SmartPhoto Case is the ability to reduce or completely remove LED flash reflections.
For the best results, your photographed subject should be in a dark room or in a place where there are no other direct light sources reflecting on the photographed surface.
Use SmartPhoto Case to illuminate the subject and its built-in filters will completely remove the unwanted reflections from the photographed object.


SmartPhoto Case can also act as a classic polarizing filter which can improve your pictures in outdoor, landscape, and see thru photography setups.
 


* We are currently evaluating possibility of adding this feature regardless of whether we reach the stretch goal or not.
 
Prototypes are being tested across the world
We have prepared dozens of prototype units and we have sent them out to our PRO TEAM members for tests and to collect their feedback.
Their opinion about the product exceeded our expectations. They love SmartPhoto Case prototypes and hearing their positive comments is a big reward for us! We are posting their unboxing and reviews on our YouTube channel. Don't hesitate to go there and view some honest testimonials.

 but smaller, cheaper and much lower power. In order to achieve this, 
the Pi-Zero was designed with very minimal I/O. To compliment this, <a href=""www.pi2design.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pi 2 Design </a>has created the Zero Shield, giving users their full-size USB ports

<p>The first release of this product will target WIFI users who use their phone - tablet - PC or Desktop strictly on a WIFI or direct router connection.   I have been living for years without that expensive monthly cell phone plan.   I live strictly on WIFI for all my communications needs.  Now you can take control of your digital communications life and be free from unauthorized snooping FOREVER.</p>

<p>Software development can be expensive.   I have developed contacts with the smartest programmers in the business.  They are eager to get started.  We have set a goal of 4 months from the final date of the funding to release the first version of WINDROIDS 11 O/S.   In software terms this is a near impossible goal BUT i am confident that we can meet that goal given proper funding.   If we fall short of this goal the money will be spent to get as much done as possible and to seek out other investors to complete the initial release.  <br/></p>
<p>But I want to be positive and believe that with <b>your help 1) donate and 2) click on the facebook LIKE button at the top left of this page ... WE WILL REACH THIS GOAL ... </b>if ever there were a campaign that needed funding this is IT !!!  This is a product that everyone needs.  <br/></p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>For everyone to be free once and for all from spying is a huge advancement.   The entire spying business has crept in because the system designs were never monitored from the very earliest days of the computer industry.   We always trusted those in positions of political and corporate power to do the ""right things"" on our behalf but we have repeatedly been sorely mistaken.   I really hate to have to say this but we all know now this is the unfortunate truth.   WINDROIDS 11 O/S is the product that finally will return control of YOUR COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS and put it back into your hands ... FOREVER.</p>
<p>IMAGINE ... no more anti-spam and anti-virus programs needed ... no more router attachments that do no get to the core of the problem ... no more of any of the Band-Aids that you have been paying for and not getting secure results. <br/></p>
<p>My background is in both hardware and software development (no i was not a programmer) ... Basically before any product in our company was started ... I wrote what was known as a ""FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATION""  and ""HARDWARE / SOFTWARE DESIGN SPECIFICATION"" ... with these documents approved at the corporate level the engineering and software development teams would begin outlining and accomplishing the tasks to make an efficient and cost effective product.  AND LASTLY before the product went to market ... I had to sign off that all the SPECIFICATIONS were met.  <br/></p>
<p>The Functional Specification outlined all the aspects that the product had to achieve.  It did not describe how one would achieve these goals but was a blueprint of all the design features INCLUDING compatibility with existing products.  After this was signed off at the corporate level I worked with the hardware and software engineers to outline all the implementations needed including performance and other issues to which the new product would conform.<br/></p>
<p>This is my experience and this is why I am the right person to build the new WINROIDS 11 O/S system AND offer if for FREE.   But I need your help.  <br/></p>

</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any project there are challenges.  Our biggest challenge will be in meeting the rigid timetable of a 4 month commitment on delivery.  This will be approximately May 2016.   My career was in meeting demanding industry schedules and maintaining quality control.   This is an extremely short time frame but with the anticipated level of funding I believe it should give the power to produce the results on schedule.   As with any product the initial release will become more powerful with time.  <br/></p>
<p>Part of the problem is that the core meaning of what an OPERATING SYSTEM should be has been lost.   The O/S was never meant to perform all the functions included in today's overburdened O/S systems.  Most of your computer power is wasted performing useless tasks many of which can be used to spy on you ... and  now literally the spying is placed directly into the operating systems so you have no choice but to live with all your information accessed without your consent.   The new WINDROIDS 11 O/S will change this and you will see a marked increase in your device response time and performance.  <br/></p>
<p>The second challenge will be keeping up with the demand of the downloading public as millions rush to download this product at the same time.   We will work with dedicated servers to accommodate these challenges.   There may be a small charge to cover the cost of maintaining the servers and download internet connections.<br/></p>

The World's first solar rechargeable fire starter.
FIRE!  One of the most important elements of survival. 
Getting fire in a survival situation no longer has to be the daunting task of starting a fire with two sticks.  We've all watched the shows where these survivalists can't make a fire and it creates misery and mayhem.  In fact, more than 97% of the world's population couldn't start a fire with two sticks if their life depended on it.   The Soliflame makes starting a fire a breeze for anyone. 
 

Where it all started - ALPHA.
This was the very first working model we made of the SoliFlame.  In ALPHA we were just trying to complete the task of having a rechargeable Lipo battery ignite a coil with the push of a button.  It did not include the onboard solar panel at this point.   We were testing the power of the battery against different coil sizes and types.
 

The Journey Continues - BETA.
After successfully completing stage ALPHA we moved on to BETA in an attempt to incorporate on onboard solar panel that could charge the battery via sunlight.  This required countless hours of redesigning our first casing.  We also had to build a circuit board that would control charging loads and wattage delivery to the coil.  We also increased the output of the battery to send it's full resource in one clip instead of sending power trickles like LED flashlights.   Our goal was to get a stable working prototype.  
 

The First Working Prototype - PROTO1.
Although we had a solid working stable prototype we were missing that sleek ergonomic design.  So,  we went back to the drawing board and created a completly new casing.  We ran the casing on a 3D printer and SoliFlame PROTO1 was born.  


Why we need your help.
So far, we have funded the entire project ourselves.  We started with $1000.00 and built a 3D printer so we could build our models.  We then covered the cost of our initial materials and custom circuit board construction.  We also covered the cost of the Patent Process which is in final review.  We completed our prototypes and now we are ready to manufacture.  In order to get off the ground we need to produce 5,000 units.  So, we are leaving it to the World's hands.  If you want it...we will build it!

<p><b>The Company</b></p>
<p>Welcome to County Cider Company. </p>
<p>We are a 20 year old cider producer located
in Prince Edward County, Ontario. The family farm in the hamlet of Waupoos has
been growing Ontario heritage apples since 1850. </p>
<p>Our growth and success has been based on
our passion and commitment to produce the best quality hard ciders anywhere –
with as little interference as possible. We are a vertically integrated company
and grow the apples that go into our cider. </p>
<p>We firmly believe that to make a great
cider vou must begin with the right type of apples.</p>
<p>Prince Edward County is a perfect place to
grow apples because it has plenty of sunshine and warmth in the summer. The
winters are relatively cool so trees go dormant and come out refreshed and
disease-free in the spring. As a result, we have reduced the use of pesticides
to the minimum effective level.<span>  </span></p>
<p>Furthermore being so close to the lake
provides a moderating effect on our local micro climate, for a longer spring and
fall.</p>
<p>Today, our hard ciders are enjoyed in bars
and restaurants throughout the province. They are also sold in LCBO stores as
well as in our own Tasting Room on the farm. Our successful brands include
County Cider and Waupoos Cider, and we also feature seasonal flavours such as
Peach and Pear and even a hopped cider.</p>
<p><b>The New Idea</b></p>
<p>Research has shown that European style
ciders will be the next big thing in cider – as consumers’ palettes mature and
their appetite for new and interesting flavours matures too.</p>
<p>The
addition of Bittersweet apples provide a far more complex taste profile in
ciders. </p>
<p>Now, instead of producing more Ontario
apple cider from dessert apples we want to do something more ambitious, unique
and totally delicious. </p>
<p>And we’re on our way. </p>
<p>With help from the University of Guelph, County
Cider Company has been experimenting with European cider apples in the orchard
for over 15 years. We planted varieties from Britain and France such as
Kingston Black, Brown Snout and Michelin – and we discovered they love the soil
and conditions here in Prince Edward County. </p>
<p>We also discovered that blending these
apples with our own Ontario heritage apples makes an amazing new ciders. </p>
<p>Tortured Path is the first cider we
produced with a blend of 75% European and 25% Ontario apples – it is a
wonderful Somerset-style cider and received a standing ovation in our tasting
room trials. </p>
<p><b>What We Need</b></p>
<p>We’ve got the root stock, the growing
conditions and the passion – and now we’re ready to grow our business by
growing more of these apples. </p>
<p>Our plan is to plant 6,000 new Kingston
Black and other European cider apple trees. We need crowd funding to help grow
our business this way.</p>
<p>We will use a new modern growing system
called the tall spindle method. Trees grow like grapes on trellises. They produce
larger, quicker yields this way: 2,000 bushels per acre compared to 400 bushels per acre
traditional apple trees, with full production coming within three years versus
10 to 25 years. </p>
<p><b>The Pay-Off </b></p>
<p>This investment will reduce our overall costs for juice. It will
help us maintain control over how we grow our fruit. And it will help us reduce
dependence on foreign grown cider apples and juice.</p>
<p>But best of all,
it will help us produce wonderful new ciders. We will be able to produce
another 250,000 liters of juice per year of a very specialized product.  </p>
<p>County Cider is seeking to raise $50,000 to
contribute towards planting a new orchard of European cider apples using the
new trellis system. </p>
<p>Help us grow traditional European cider
apples in Ontario so we can make a new and unique product here. </p>
<p>Once this planting is established our
orchards will, in total, remove over 800 tons of CO2 from the atmosphere (equivalent to the
annual gas emissions of 167 cars)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The History of Minute Drivers</b></p>
<p>Edward Mbeche, founder and CEO of Minute Drivers, knows car
service, knows mobile phone technology, and knows the benefits for consumers
when these two worlds meet. Fresh out of college with a degree in computer
management, Mbeche worked for Blackberry for two years before relocating from
New Jersey to Washington, D.C. There, he fell in love with the car service
industry, and after working for a time as a taxi dispatcher, he seized an
opportunity to create his own business.</p>
<p>Thirteen years later, Global Sedan Service, the car service
company that he founded, is still going strong. Edward Mbeche understands that
his success is founded on the principles of quality service and continual
innovation; Minute Drivers, his latest venture, is the logical extension of
these principles: excellence, on demand.</p>
<p></p>
<h3></h3>
<p><b>Minute Drivers – Because Competition Drives Innovation</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Though the car service on demand market might be getting
crowded, there's always room for another player, if that player has what it
takes to distinguish itself from the competition. Competition isn't dangerous;
complacency is. At Minute Drivers, we believe that competition drives innovation,
and we are convinced that, with our innovative approach to app-based car
service, Minute Drivers will swiftly build a dedicated client base. After all,
Minute Drivers offers an irresistible value: a quality drive at a reasonable
price, delivered at the tap of a smartphone.</p>

The History of Minute Drivers
Edward Mbeche, founder and CEO of Minute Drivers, knows car
service, knows mobile phone technology, and knows the benefits for consumers
when these two worlds meet. Fresh out of college with a degree in computer
management, Mbeche worked for Blackberry for two years before relocating from
New Jersey to Washington, D.C. There, he fell in love with the car service
industry, and after working for a time as a taxi dispatcher, he seized an
opportunity to create his own business.
Thirteen years later, Global Sedan Service, the car service
company that he founded, is still going strong. Edward Mbeche understands that
his success is founded on the principles of quality service and continual
innovation; Minute Drivers, his latest venture, is the logical extension of
these principles: excellence, on demand.


Minute Drivers – Because Competition Drives Innovation

Though the car service on demand market might be getting
crowded, there's always room for another player, if that player has what it
takes to distinguish itself from the competition. Competition isn't dangerous;
complacency is. At Minute Drivers, we believe that competition drives innovation,
and we are convinced that, with our innovative approach to app-based car
service, Minute Drivers will swiftly build a dedicated client base. After all,
Minute Drivers offers an irresistible value: a quality drive at a reasonable
price, delivered at the tap of a smartphone.
Minute Drivers Insures All Vehicles with up to $5 Million
in Coverage



Minute Drivers - Investment Goals & Benefits



From
design to development to launch, we estimate $25,000 in start-up costs.


Investment
funds will be used for both development and marketing of Minute Drivers.


All
supporters will receive perks in gratitude for their faith in the product.


Perks
can be claimed nationwide.


Perks
are transferable to family, friends, etc.

</div></div>","Fast Charging on the move is now possible. FlashBank has achieved a technology breakthrough for Portable Power Bank. You can have the flexibility to charge FlashBank either indoor or outdoor.YES! While you are driving, you can charge FlashBank. In just 13.9 minutes, it is fully charged to 2200 mAh and that allows you to charge your mobile devices to 100%*. By the time you reach your destination, FlashBank is power up and ready to serve its purpose. (*- 100% is based on iPhone series)Inspired by our patented electric bus fast charging technology, FlashBank prides itself on its ability to REALLY keep your mobile devices energize on the GO throughout the day.


With durable components and a long lifespan of 2000 charge cycles, mobile device users NO longer have to worry about unstable power bank that takes too long to recharge and too quick to lose the power.

Charge Time of Hand Phone in the Market:

In this table, it shows the total charge time from 0% to 100% in hours for the above list of hand phones in the market. The fastest time among them was Samsung Galaxy S6 edge (TMOUS) which took 1.48 hours (88.8 minutes) to have their internal battery fully charge. As compared with FlashBank that took only 13.9 minutes to have itself fully charge before charging a hand phone, that is approximately 6.34 times much faster. Although it is not exactly accurate to do such comparison because their capacity are different, but they shouldn't be far off too much. 
Comparison With Other Brands Of Portable Power Bank's Charging Time
 

Every single portable power bank has their own unique features. At least they can minimally provide power to energize your devices. Some of them are compact, some of them are stylish and some of them have high capacity. For FlashBank our focus is to develop a power bank that is close to the consumers' preferences on the characteristic of their ideal power bank. We wanted our final product to be able to achieve fast charging, not bounded to wall, long cycle life and most important of all, affordable.  In the above table, we have gathered few of the more popular brands in the market to do a comparison with our product on our key feature, fast charging. It significantly bring up the capability of FlashBank. Comparing with the closest competitor Anker, FlashBank is 8.57 times faster.

their high monthly entertainment prices and bad experiences, we invite

<b>Cord Length: </b>It measures out at 4 feet in length. Its longer than the original Apple cable but long enough so you won't need to contort yourself into strange yogic positions while watching the latest episode of ""The Walking Dead"" at night in bed on your phone or tablet.<br/>
</div><div><br/></div><div>
<b>Material: </b>Covered in fabric braiding, which makes it easily conform to the curves of your bed (and makes it just plain nice to have around). Best of all, it's duper durable and is pretty impossible to knot up and tangle.... Basically, its tangle free!!<br/>
</div><div><br/></div><div>
<b>Anti-Waste Packaging: </b>All cables come with no wasteful packaging. That means everything you get with your cable is useful in every way possible. The packaging that your cables come in will also double as a waterproof pouch for you to put your cell phone or any other accessories you want to keep dry and dirt free for whatever life brings your way. Prototype Photos of actual packaging are currently being created. Will post ASAP. <br/>

The GoPlug Smart Power Bank is a beautiful, intelligent and adaptable battery pack designed around the workflows of photographers, creatives, travelers and commuters. It's more than just a battery, it's your day-to-day essential life saver, and it does things other power supplies can't.The GoPlug Smart Power Bank connects to your smartphone, enabling features that will forever change the way you power mobility.
It comes in a 110V version.......and a 220V version with an universal AC port.



Easy to Use
Anything you can plug into a wall outlet, you can plug into GoPlug's Smart Power Bank...


 ...and it will make your everyday powering experience wonderful, no matter what you're doing.

It's Smart
In addition to operation the power bank manually, you can control the Smart Power Bank from your mobile phone. From the app you can initiate power, set powering times, receive alert notifications, track its location, be notified if you are leaving it behind, and program ON/OFF times much like you would an alarm. 
You can also charge a laptop up to two times and a smartphone over 14 times. Isn’t that awesome?


Power Anything.  Anywhere.

Gone are the days when binding yourself to a wall outlet for electricity is the norm—
When batteries die, productivity should not.  



The GoPlug Smart Power Bank will keep users connected and increase productivity, leading to increased revenue and eliminate stress for unproductive, frustrated, on-the-go professionals who constantly run out of power.
Off-Grid

AC/DCBefore this acronym became synonymous for a well-known band, it was a heated energy rivalry in the 1900's between Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison.  We won't get into who's current flow was better, however, they're both used all over the world today.  Our Smart Power Bank provides both currents in one compact Smart Power Bank-- I guess you can say we're kinda like peacekeepers!




Just to reiterate, anything you can plug into the wall, you can plug into GoPlug's Smart Power Bank.Here's a quick video showing its power (no tricks or audio overdubbing):



It's been designed to charge or power a variety of electronics...


...even jumpstart a car.


Who knows when you'll need a boost of power-- not just for smartphones and laptops,





Manual Mode

The Power Mode Switch allows users to select between 12V, 19V, or AC output powering options.  
APP Mode


Timer controlled powering: Just like an alarm clock, timer controlled powering can be set on the GoPlug Smart Power Bank.  Just plug the device(s) into the Smart Power Bank, and set the times you want the Smart Power Bank to turn ON/OFF.  It's that simple!



Timer controlled powering can also be set and switched between different power ports.
Battery Preserve Mode:  Wanna keep a little juice in the power bank for those unexpected situations? You can set the GoPlug Smart Power Bank to shut off when that battery life hits a percentage you choose.



Charging Complete Notifications: Ever wonder when your camera batteries are fully charged?  Receive notifications when your electronics are fully charged.  You can also receive alert notifications when the GoPlug Power Bank is fully charged.



Power Select: When the GoPlug Power Bank is in the Bluetooth setting, you can initiate different powering options from a mobile device.


Proximity Sensor: Carry this in your bag or luggage. Thanks to the proximity sensors, you will receive alerts when you are separated from your gear. You can also locate your GoPlug Smart Power Bank with a proximity heat map and receive a reminder of the last recorded location. 



GPS: If you ever lose your GoPlug Smart Power Bank, the GoPlug network will help you track the location of your power bank. As the network grows, we will cover the whole planet.
Movement Alarm: The GoPlug Smart Power Bank will send an alert notification if its moved.  Talk about peace of mind, we've thought of it all!


The GoPlug Smart Power Bank can be recharged one of three ways: AC wall outlet, Car Cigarette port, or Solar.

<h2><strong>Project Description</strong></h2>
<p>The project started with an innovative idea to make traffic stops safer by improving communication between motorists and law enforcement officers.  We wanted to utilize technology to assist with one of the most dangerous activities in policing.  We felt that improving communication would make traffic stops safer for law enforcement and motorists. The app enables,  </p>
<p>• <strong>Motorists</strong> to send key information like driver’s license and insurance to law enforcement at the push of a button </p>
<p>• <strong>Law Enforcement</strong> to gain more insight into the driver before approaching the car  </p>
<p>• More <strong>transparency</strong> for both motorist and law enforcement  </p>
<p>• <strong>Reduction in tension</strong> that sometimes occurs between both motorist and law enforcement </p>
<p>• Utilization of <strong>GPS</strong> based information  </p>
<p>• <strong>Smarter policing</strong></p>
<p>The goal of the app is to better utilize technology including smart phone technology and GPS technology to connect motorists with law enforcement.  It is meant to enhance the current procedures used by law enforcement during traffic stops.  It allows the motorists to introduce themselves to the officer by volunteering who he or she is before the officer even gets out of their vehicle and in return the officer name is sent back to the motorists.  We wanted to remove some of the unknown.  This is done by allowing motorists to tell a few key points about themselves like occupation (coach, homemaker, teacher, engineer).  They can also inform the officer of any physical or development impediments that could impact interaction during the stop.  This may include things like hearing issues, bipolar, PTSD, language bearer.  Other considerations can be situations like if the motorist has a special needs child that normally travels with them that could get excited, then that can be disclosed before the officer approaches the car.  With each party knowing just a little more about the other, we hope to reduce tension and therefore make the experience safer for all parties.</p>

<h2><strong>How Does Mysmart Stop Work</strong></h2>

<h2>Why This Project</h2>
<p>Today there have been many reported cases of mistrust between motorists and law enforcement officers.  We started by asking a simple question: What can be done to make traffic stops safer? One of the biggest obstacles in our opinion is communication.  Better communication between motorist and officers at the beginning of a traffic stop can reduce some needless tragedies.  In fact, many states have adopted legislation on how to interact with police officers during a traffic stop.  The overwhelming majority of motorists are law abiding citizens.  If they are stopped for a traffic violation, they just want to get their ticket and go on with their day and return safely to their families.  Most Law Enforcement officers are also law abiding, hard-working individuals whom have one of the most dangerous jobs around and just want to do their jobs to the best of their abilities and make it home safely to their families.  Our goal is to build something that will assist both parties.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Why Indiegogo</h2>
<p>Part of the idea behind the lean startup is to prove demand, and build an app with a lean team, using proven user centric design providing the best overall experience.  We feel that Indiegogo will help build demand for the app, build and grow a strong relationship with our early supporters, and use feedback to build the product that the public demands.  The app is also a free download so funding will help speed the development and support the production cycle.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Who Are We?</strong></h2>
<p>Mysmart Stop is a product of Velocity Technology Associates, LLC. Velocity Technology Associates is a start-up technology company led by President/CEO, Ben Williams.</p>
<p>Ben Williams is a seasoned information technology professional.  Throughout his career, Ben has filled a number of roles including,</p>
<ul>
<li>programmer,</li>
<li>systems analyst,</li>
<li>team lead,</li>
<li>project manager,</li>
<li>principal consultant,</li>
<li>vice president of business development,</li>
<li>entrepreneur,</li>
<li>Business owner,</li>
<li>President/CEO,</li>
</ul>
<p>We are always looking for ways to better utilize technology to build really good products.  Developing apps enables us to connect with the technology trends employed by Millennials, Gen X and Gen Y while still remaining on the leading edge of technology. </p>
<h1>Development Status</h1>
<p>We are currently on the 2nd beta version of the app for IOS devices.  After the first beta version of the app was completed in April’2017, we spent a fair amount of time enhancing our team for success of this app.  We also met with a number of different law enforcement departments and officers to demo the app and discuss what features they would like to see and any obstacles they saw.  Finally, our patent pending communication technology is unique and will enable us securely and quickly transfer data.  Product development timeline,</p>
<ul><li>Jul’2016 – Idea</li></ul>
<ul><li>Oct’2016 – Finalized team to build the app  </li></ul>
<ul><li>Nov’2016 – App Blueprint Completed</li></ul>
<ul><li>Apr’2017 – iOS Beta Version 1 of app complete</li></ul>
<ul><li>Jun’2018 – iOS Beta Version 2 of app complete after gathering more feedback from Law Enforcement and the Public</li></ul>
<ul><li>Oct’2018 – Indiegogo Campaign Launch</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>How will the funds be used ? </strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>$30,000 allows us to Productionize the IOS version of the app and develop the android version.  This includes: enhancing user interface design, finalize the back-end database and processes</li>
<li>$15,000 allows us to complete piloting of the app with a police department, including making some enhancements, quality assurance, on-going support and maintenance of the app and delivery systems, enhanced security procedures</li>
<li>$10,000 is for on-going marketing strategy to continue to grow public support and usage of the app.  </li>
<li>Funds above our goal of $55,000 will be used for the on-going maintenance and cost of keeping the app free to motorists and to add features to make the app even more appealing.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Risks and Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>At this stage in the development of the Mysmart Stop app, we are in 2<sup>nd</sup> round of Beta testing and most issues and concerns with the functionality have been addressed.  We are using crowd funding not only to raise funds to complete development but to prove that there is demand for this product so we can complete production as well as getting an understanding of public demand to help to determine future enhancements.  If law enforcement personnel fail to adopt the use of the app, broader utilization could be a problem.  However, we have already met with several law enforcement agencies to demo the app and get feedback.  The feedback has been positive.  They indicated that this has a lot of potential.  We also discussed adding some features that will make it even more attractive to law enforcement and the public.  We feel that the time is right for this.  If the project is properly funded, through marketing and word of mouth as well as through public demand, we feel that the public will help champion the cause and that utilization will grow quickly and adoption will happen county by county and state by state.  In addition, we have a law enforcement officer with over 30 years of experience on our team.</p>

The goal of the app is to better utilize technology including smart phone technology and GPS technology to connect motorists with law enforcement.  It is meant to enhance the current procedures used by law enforcement during traffic stops.  It allows the motorists to introduce themselves to the officer by volunteering who he or she is before the officer even gets out of their vehicle and in return the officer name is sent back to the motorists.  We wanted to remove some of the unknown.  This is done by allowing motorists to tell a few key points about themselves like occupation (coach, homemaker, teacher, engineer).  They can also inform the officer of any physical or development impediments that could impact interaction during the stop.  This may include things like hearing issues, bipolar, PTSD, language bearer.  Other considerations can be situations like if the motorist has a special needs child that normally travels with them that could get excited, then that can be disclosed before the officer approaches the car.  With each party knowing just a little more about the other, we hope to reduce tension and therefore make the experience safer for all parties.
 
How Does Mysmart Stop Work
Allows motorists to connect with law enforcement officer and send information about themselves to police officers as soon as the officer begins to pull them over.  
  
App is free download for drivers

Communication must be initiated by the driver using the app by pressing a button

Key information about the driver like driver’s license, insurance information, CHL license are sent to the officer.
In return, officer name is sent back to the driver.

Special considerations about the driver that could impact the interaction also sent. Things like Language bearer, hearing issues, PTSD, Bipolar, medical issues, are just a few.
This ensures that the officer has more information before approaching the vehicle.

Text sent to Driver’s Designated Emergency Contacts
Information is compressed and sent securely for fast delivery.  Takes seconds to receive information.

Transparency for both motorist and police

Why This Project
Today there have been many reported cases of mistrust between motorists and law enforcement officers.  We started by asking a simple question: What can be done to make traffic stops safer? One of the biggest obstacles in our opinion is communication.  Better communication between motorist and officers at the beginning of a traffic stop can reduce some needless tragedies.  In fact, many states have adopted legislation on how to interact with police officers during a traffic stop.  The overwhelming majority of motorists are law abiding citizens.  If they are stopped for a traffic violation, they just want to get their ticket and go on with their day and return safely to their families.  Most Law Enforcement officers are also law abiding, hard-working individuals whom have one of the most dangerous jobs around and just want to do their jobs to the best of their abilities and make it home safely to their families.  Our goal is to build something that will assist both parties.
 
Why Indiegogo
Part of the idea behind the lean startup is to prove demand, and build an app with a lean team, using proven user centric design providing the best overall experience.  We feel that Indiegogo will help build demand for the app, build and grow a strong relationship with our early supporters, and use feedback to build the product that the public demands.  The app is also a free download so funding will help speed the development and support the production cycle.

We are always looking for ways to better utilize technology to build really good products.  Developing apps enables us to connect with the technology trends employed by Millennials, Gen X and Gen Y while still remaining on the leading edge of technology. 
Development Status
We are currently on the 2nd beta version of the app for IOS devices.  After the first beta version of the app was completed in April’2017, we spent a fair amount of time enhancing our team for success of this app.  We also met with a number of different law enforcement departments and officers to demo the app and discuss what features they would like to see and any obstacles they saw.  Finally, our patent pending communication technology is unique and will enable us securely and quickly transfer data.  Product development timeline,
Jul’2016 – Idea
Oct’2016 – Finalized team to build the app  
Nov’2016 – App Blueprint Completed
Apr’2017 – iOS Beta Version 1 of app complete
Jun’2018 – iOS Beta Version 2 of app complete after gathering more feedback from Law Enforcement and the Public
Oct’2018 – Indiegogo Campaign Launch
 
How will the funds be used ? 

$30,000 allows us to Productionize the IOS version of the app and develop the android version.  This includes: enhancing user interface design, finalize the back-end database and processes
$15,000 allows us to complete piloting of the app with a police department, including making some enhancements, quality assurance, on-going support and maintenance of the app and delivery systems, enhanced security procedures
$10,000 is for on-going marketing strategy to continue to grow public support and usage of the app.  
Funds above our goal of $55,000 will be used for the on-going maintenance and cost of keeping the app free to motorists and to add features to make the app even more appealing.

 
Risks and Challenges
At this stage in the development of the Mysmart Stop app, we are in 2nd round of Beta testing and most issues and concerns with the functionality have been addressed.  We are using crowd funding not only to raise funds to complete development but to prove that there is demand for this product so we can complete production as well as getting an understanding of public demand to help to determine future enhancements.  If law enforcement personnel fail to adopt the use of the app, broader utilization could be a problem.  However, we have already met with several law enforcement agencies to demo the app and get feedback.  The feedback has been positive.  They indicated that this has a lot of potential.  We also discussed adding some features that will make it even more attractive to law enforcement and the public.  We feel that the time is right for this.  If the project is properly funded, through marketing and word of mouth as well as through public demand, we feel that the public will help champion the cause and that utilization will grow quickly and adoption will happen county by county and state by state.  In addition, we have a law enforcement officer with over 30 years of experience on our team.

<p>Some friends and I went to a bar after a long day at school. After a drink or two, all our phones were out of power. The bar had no chargers to borrow.</p>
<p>Instead of going home to charge, we ordered more drinks and brainstormed how to make our own power bank that could charge all types of personal devices without being plugged into the wall. The following day we designed a prototype.</p>
<p>The first prototype was made with a 2-liter milk carton. The second prototype was made of a small wooden speaker that we had to reduce by 1/3. Many hours and ideas later we found a design that worked. </p>
<p>Pawā Box was born.</p>
<p>After a few months, we successfully created the very first plastic mold. The first production batch was for 50 boxes. We showed Pawā Box to friends and family, local restaurants, bars, and businesses. The feedback we received was exceptional so now we are setting out to make more with our first large production run.</p>

<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>According To statistics, large number of bikes are stolen in summer, save your bikes from theft this summer by having TheiShare locks. TheiShare lock is the best lock when it comes to bike safety and it is one of the reasons we are offering <strong>THREE </strong>years warranty.</li>
<li><p>Bike Crash Alarm  sends alarm to emergency services and nearby riders, this feature will definitely help to save all valuable lives.</p></li>
<li>TheiShare Lock will donate 5% of <strong>ALL </strong>amounts raised to help those who have lost jobs due to <strong>Covid-19</strong>. Support us by buying locks or sharing this campaign on your social media(s).</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>We are excited to introduce TheiShare, this project has been our passion since last summer. We have been working on the development of IoT based platforms since 2018. We have hands-on experience building IoT locks for the mobility sector. We believe TheiShare locks to be a groundbreaking product and one that will have a major impact on our handling bikes and ride-sharing experience.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>ENHANCING BIKE SAFETY</strong></p>
<p><strong>SAVING YOU MONEY</strong></p>
<p><strong>SHARING AND GPS TAGGING.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Our mission is to digitize and secure bikes.</strong></h2>
<p>In an era of social distancing where taking public transport is NOT recommended, we firmly believe that TheiShare lock will play a vital role in society. Currently, it is NOT possible to share bikes with your neighbours or friends in case if you share a key then they have NO idea where the bike is parked? but with TheiShare lock, bikes can digitally be shared with neighbours/friends and shared members can view the latest location of the bike. Let's share our mobility assets and help each other in the neighbourhood &lt;3</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Mass production is already begun!</strong></h2>
<p>Everyone is back to work in China :) Here is latest footage of assembling TheiShare lock. We are producing 2000 locks per day.</p>

According To statistics, large number of bikes are stolen in summer, save your bikes from theft this summer by having TheiShare locks. TheiShare lock is the best lock when it comes to bike safety and it is one of the reasons we are offering THREE years warranty.
Bike Crash Alarm  sends alarm to emergency services and nearby riders, this feature will definitely help to save all valuable lives.
TheiShare Lock will donate 5% of ALL amounts raised to help those who have lost jobs due to Covid-19. Support us by buying locks or sharing this campaign on your social media(s).

 
We are excited to introduce TheiShare, this project has been our passion since last summer. We have been working on the development of IoT based platforms since 2018.

ENHANCING BIKE SAFETY
SAVING YOU MONEY
SHARING AND GPS TAGGING.
 
Our mission is to digitize and secure bikes.
In an era of social distancing where taking public transport is NOT recommended, we firmly believe that TheiShare lock will play a vital role in society. Currently, it is NOT possible to share bikes with your neighbours or friends in case if you share a key then they have NO idea where the bike is parked? but with TheiShare lock, bikes can digitally be shared with neighbours/friends and shared members can view the latest location of the bike. Let's share our mobility assets and help each other in the neighbourhood <3
 
Mass production is already begun!
Everyone is back to work in China :) Here is latest footage of assembling TheiShare lock. We are producing 2000 locks per day.


 

 





The platform is already released and mass production has already begun, so this project is going ahead but we are hoping we can raise additional funds through crowdfunding which will enable user to increase inventory and widen our marketing scope, but more importantly, help build a strong base of early customers (hopefully you) to be part of this journey. share ongoing feedback and ideas for the future. We plan to treat all our early backers as part of this project and involve them in all new releases and developments. We welcome you to come on board, be part of this exciting journey and enjoy immediate and ongoing benefits.   We have created a Facebook group kindly join the group if you are interested to be part of this journey.

<h2>WHY?   
</h2>
<p><b>Changes
are occurring in today’s United States population which needs to be addressed.
A few of these changes are the following: </b></p>
<p><span></span><b>Today’s population is aging. Ten
thousand people turn sixty-five years-old everyday due to the baby
boomers. 
</b></p>
<h4>
<b>Over two-thirds (68.8%) of the
United States population are overweight or obese. More than one-third (35.7%)
are classified as obese</b>.  <b>More
than 1 in 20 (6.3%) have extreme
obesity.</b>·<span>  </span>
</h4>
<h4>
<b>Conflicts around the world and other
situations cause the number of disabled individuals to increase daily. Over
fifty-seven million (19%) citizens of the United States, are disabled to some
degree.</b>
</h4>
<p><b>Industries today do not seem
interested in addressing some of these problems with affordable solutions to
help the afflicted remain mobile and independent – we want to help. </b></p>                                   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439157913/sggtonsz5spvxrltpsed.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 335.482px; height: 402px;""/><br/><br/><b>Our invention, “An Independent Step” is a perfect example of the old adage, “Necessity
is the mother of invention.” We needed to transport some disabled persons to
the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida. The choice was made to rent a
fifteen-passenger van for the trip. Due to previous experience we were
concerned about the ability of our passengers navigating the twenty-inch step
height while entering and exiting the van safely and quickly.</b><br/><br/>                                   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439167958/o0odvvqtlsz39wk5agh2.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 393.111px; height: 295px;""/><b>                                   </b><b><br/>Our
passengers included a four-foot eleven-inch tall eighty year-old lady, her
eighty-one year-old husband with two bad knees and on oxygen and an obese lady
weighing over four hundred pounds. Entering fifteen-passenger vans can be
challenging for anyone but very difficult or impossible for elderly, disabled
or obese. Exiting the van is more difficult as most people back out blindly
while holding onto the arm of the seat. Both entering and exiting the van has
the potential of causing an accident.<br/><br/></b>
<p><b>Visiting
twelve medical supply stores and researching medical catalogues produced no
information on an appropriate assistance apparatus. Hours of research on the
internet turned up nothing of help. I had developed in my mind the prototype we
needed. The stepstool we needed would have handrails to provide stability and a
weight limit of five hundred pounds minimum. </b></p>
<p><b>My
wife and I went to a hardware store where I put together the prototype. The
step worked great on the trip. Courtesy vans drivers were asking what we were
using to load and unload so quickly. They also noticed my passengers exiting
the van forward instead of backing out. The trip was pleasurable, safe and less
stressful due to the step prototype.</b></p>
<p><b>At the
Mayo Clinic we saw that many other people were in the same dilemma and no help
in sight. Bradshaw Solutions, L.L.C. was founded with a mission to develop
products to help the elderly, disabled and obese maintain or restore their
independence and be more active. “An Independent Step” is our first ""step”
toward our mission. We have some other products in the research/prototype stage.
Success of ”An<span>  Independent Step” will
determine the timeline of more innovative, helpful and affordable products.</span></b></p>

most 4-wheel drive pickups and SUVs.</b></p>
<p><span>·<span>  </span></span><b>The 5-inch model is helpful for entering
regular vehicles for people which have restricted mobility related to their
legs and especially the knees.</b></p>
<p><span>·<span>  </span></span><b>Mini-buses use the 5-inch model to provide
assistance at the bottom of their bus steps to supply handrails and an
additional last step. For some passengers the last bus step is too high and
needs our “Step” to compensate thus making the loading and unloading process
easier and safer.</b></p>
<p><span>·<span>  </span></span><b>Mechanics buy 10-inch models to stand on
while working under the hood of 4-wheel drive and other over-sized vehicles.</b></p>

size fits the particular situation.</b></p>

<h2><b>WHICH MODEL?</b></h2>
<p><b>“An
Independent Step” has six models, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 inch platform heights.
The number represents the height from the surface to the top
of the “Step” platform. The best method is to measure this ground to platform top  and divide this number in half and that determines which “An
Independent Step” model needed. (Example: You take the measurement described
above and it is 16 inches. The 8-inch model would be my suggestion as the 16 inches
is reduced to 2 doable 8-inch steps.) <i>NOTE:
This platform height should also be no more than the height the main user can
easily achieve</i>. Steps at home are normally 8 inches tall so you can use a
regular step to analyze the abilities of the potential users.</b></p>
<p><b>Some
venues do not fit my method above. The mini-buses and tour buses make use of
the 5-inch “step” to shorten the last step while adding stability with the
handrails during exiting and entering. For example my mother required a 5 inch
step to get in her Crown Victoria due to the lack of flexibility in her knees.
One 90 year-old gentlemen bought a 5 inch step to get in and out of his sunken
living room (remember those) which was an 8 inch step and he could not achieve
safely. If unsure about model needed, contact me for assistance. We strive to
sell you the most appropriate model for end user.</b></p>
<h4><b>Recently
the necessity for a two-step model has become apparent. A church has a higher van
with a first step of 23.5 inches. I will complete this two-step prototype after
this crowdfunding is completed. Should a two-step be needed currently you nest
a 5 and 10 inch model to navigate 15 inches if needed.</b></h4>

<h2>SCRIPT - VIDEO</h2>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>My name is Stephen
Bradshaw, President and founder of Bradshaw Solutions, L.L.C. There is a large and growing number of
elderly, disabled, and obese people in our communities.</b><b> These somewhat immobile persons struggle to get into vehicles
such<i> as </i>church vans and other situations
requiring a step.  They want to participate in activities, but because of
their physical disabilities it has become unsafe, extremely difficult or
impossible for them to enter or exit a van and join their friends. <span>This can be problematic,
especially if these individuals are trying to get to medical facilities for
treatments or checkups, and preventing them from getting services they need. </span></b><b>Today’s
stepstools do not offer the stability or weight limits required for today’s
population. </b><b>Typical stepstools are not sturdy, creating a potential for
an accidental injury.  </b></p>
<p><b>We
would like to use this opportunity to show our solution, a stepstool which
weighs only sixteen pounds with handrails and a five hundred weight limit, “An
Independent Step.” Our product is a totally unique and innovative stepstool.
“An Independent Step” is so unique and innovative that nothing even remotely
similar can be found on the Internet. Our innovations are the greatest
improvements on stepstools since a fourth leg was added to the three leg model.</b></p>
<p><b>What
makes “An Independent Step” different from other steps in the marketplace? This step composition of aluminum
results in “An Independent Step” amazingly weighing only sixteen pounds making
handling manageable by nearly everyone. The use of aluminum and the
construction design result in a robust weight limit of five hundred pounds. The
standard weight limit for most stepstools is two hundred fifty pounds or less.</b></p>
<p><b>Our step is produced totally of aluminum. The
worry of UV deterioration of the plastic versions is eliminated totally. Uniquely
our step has two handrails providing added stability for the user. These
handrails are also removable from the base to make storage and travel much
easier. </b></p>
<p><b>“An Independent Step” uses runners instead of
legs. The runners provide eight times
the surface area platform to ground contact allowing our step to be used in
dirt, grass, or sand without sinking into the surface. The runners extending
outside the platform increase forward and backward stability. Runners are also on
the edge of the side of the platform to supply more right and left stability.</b></p>
<p><b>The
three years of developing our product, “An Independent Step”, has been worthwhile
because it helps restore people’s independence in their daily activities.
Through the years our bodies change in ways that may restrict our activities
due to development of disabilities great and small. This restriction of
activities may ultimately result in obesity and loss of the feeling of
independence. </b></p>
<p><b>You
find yourself dependent on others for the smallest tasks such as entering a
vehicle to go to the doctor or some other venue. Some doctors have concluded
people may break their hip while straining to enter high ground clearance
vehicles or other situations. The break may proceed the fall due to the straining
to perform a task. We all know someone who needs and would benefit from “An
Independent Step.” This person may be in your family or not. It could be your
parents, grandparents, or yourself.</b><span>  </span></p>
<p><b>An
Independent Step” is not just for high ground clearance vehicles. Often new
step uses are found by our customers such as getting into today’s higher beds
or reaching items on shelves.<span>  </span></b></p>
<p><b>We are
proud of our product and now are educating the world to the need, existence and
usage of this innovative invention, “An Independent Step.” Join us on the
momentous and rewarding journey of sustaining or returning independence to
everyone.</b></p>
<p><b>“We not only stand behind our step” </b></p>
<p><b><i><u>Then stand up on the step and say,</u></i></b></p>
<p><b>“We stand on it.” </b></p>

helping the world regain independence, click the “Contribute” button. Thank you
for your time.</b></p>

WHY?   

Changes
are occurring in today’s United States population which needs to be addressed.
A few of these changes are the following: 
Today’s population is aging. Ten
thousand people turn sixty-five years-old everyday due to the baby
boomers. 


Over two-thirds (68.8%) of the
United States population are overweight or obese. More than one-third (35.7%)
are classified as obese.  More
than 1 in 20 (6.3%) have extreme
obesity.·  


Conflicts around the world and other
situations cause the number of disabled individuals to increase daily. Over
fifty-seven million (19%) citizens of the United States, are disabled to some
degree.

Industries today do not seem
interested in addressing some of these problems with affordable solutions to
help the afflicted remain mobile and independent – we want to help.                                    Our invention, “An Independent Step” is a perfect example of the old adage, “Necessity
is the mother of invention.” We needed to transport some disabled persons to
the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida. The choice was made to rent a
fifteen-passenger van for the trip. Due to previous experience we were
concerned about the ability of our passengers navigating the twenty-inch step
height while entering and exiting the van safely and quickly.                                                                      Our
passengers included a four-foot eleven-inch tall eighty year-old lady, her
eighty-one year-old husband with two bad knees and on oxygen and an obese lady
weighing over four hundred pounds. Entering fifteen-passenger vans can be
challenging for anyone but very difficult or impossible for elderly, disabled
or obese. Exiting the van is more difficult as most people back out blindly
while holding onto the arm of the seat. Both entering and exiting the van has
the potential of causing an accident.
Visiting
twelve medical supply stores and researching medical catalogues produced no
information on an appropriate assistance apparatus. Hours of research on the
internet turned up nothing of help. I had developed in my mind the prototype we
needed. The stepstool we needed would have handrails to provide stability and a
weight limit of five hundred pounds minimum. 
My
wife and I went to a hardware store where I put together the prototype. The
step worked great on the trip. Courtesy vans drivers were asking what we were
using to load and unload so quickly. They also noticed my passengers exiting
the van forward instead of backing out. The trip was pleasurable, safe and less
stressful due to the step prototype.
At the
Mayo Clinic we saw that many other people were in the same dilemma and no help
in sight. Bradshaw Solutions, L.L.C. was founded with a mission to develop
products to help the elderly, disabled and obese maintain or restore their
independence and be more active. “An Independent Step” is our first ""step”
toward our mission. We have some other products in the research/prototype stage.
Success of ”An  Independent Step” will
determine the timeline of more innovative, helpful and affordable products.

USES


The
following “An Independent Step” uses list shows the versatility and the list is
continually evolving and growing: 
·   As stated earlier “An Independent Step” 10-inch
model was initially produced to help persons entering and exiting fifteen-passenger vans.                             

                  My family doctor bought the first 10-inch “Step”
sold to the public for his patients to use for stability climbing on and off
the examination table.  Therapist may have patients that during home
visits use the “Step” in their therapy session to simulate stairs.
·
   MRI and X-ray units use our “Step” for
safe, stable assistance for patients to move on and off the examination table.                                      The 10-inch “Step” also works best for
most 4-wheel drive pickups and SUVs.
·  The 5-inch model is helpful for entering
regular vehicles for people which have restricted mobility related to their
legs and especially the knees.
·  Mini-buses use the 5-inch model to provide
assistance at the bottom of their bus steps to supply handrails and an
additional last step. For some passengers the last bus step is too high and
needs our “Step” to compensate thus making the loading and unloading process
easier and safer.
·  Mechanics buy 10-inch models to stand on
while working under the hood of 4-wheel drive and other over-sized vehicles.
·  When using the “Step” for entering and
exiting the today's higher beds, the model used depends on the individual and which
size fits the particular situation.
·  Obese individuals are having problems sitting
back into lift chairs. Sitting on the edge of the chair, some break the arms of
the lift chair trying to push their bottom back further into the seat. Using
the “Step” one sits on the chair, raise their legs to place the “Step” under
their feet and push on the “Step” with their legs to push back into the chair.                                
     I use my “Step” to wash my car. It is much
safer than opening the door and standing on the running board while holding on
for dear life.

·  Boats use the step to help people navigate
boarding and exiting their craft.
·  RVs and campers use the “Step” for venues
created by greater step height when leveling their vehicles. 
·                                                     
   My wife and I love to use “An Independent
Step” to work and store items on shelves. 
·  With the handrails the “Step” provide a
stable platform for changing light bulbs as well as other chores.
·  My wife recently discovered the ""Step”
works great as a gardening seat and the handrails help with standing up when
finished.
·  TOMORROW?
What
new use can you find? Contact us and we will add it to our list. The uses are
only limited by your creativity although always error on the side of safety
with your creativity as “An Independent Step” may not be the proper tool in all
situations.
LOOK
FOR
Every
year about 33 million Americans are injured badly
enough to require medical care. In every age group, the most common cause of
non-fatal injuries is falling down.
Most
falling injuries (including slip and fall injuries) result in minor cuts and
bruises, but sometimes the injuries can be very serious. Catastrophic injuries
like head trauma or broken hips can mean living with a permanent, debilitating
condition that impacts every part of your life for the rest of your life.                                 Stepstools pose a classic fall risk. In fact, over 1 million FOLDING
stepstools have recently been recalled because of safety issues that
resulted in two back injuries and one fractured leg.
NOTE: “An Independent
Step” has no folding parts!
Falls from stepstools can be caused by structural or design
flaws (e.g., the stool collapses) or by the person using the stool losing their
balance. 

 NOTE: “An Independent
Step” has a robust structure and has two
handrails to provide more assistance with balance.

There’s nothing consumers can do directly about structural or
design flaws, but we can help prevent falls from balance loss by choosing and
using wisely. 
NOTE: Buy “An
Independent Step” to avoid these flaws.
When buying a stepstool, make sure that –
• The legs are sturdy.
• The base is wider than the top.
• There is a handrail which extends above the top step.
• The steps are deep enough to fit your feet.
.NOTE: “An Independent Step” has all the above!
When using a step stool, make sure that –
• It is tall enough.
• It is strong enough (look at the label).
• It is placed firmly on an even surface.
• It is locked.  NOT “An Independent
Step"" problem   
                                      
When using your stepstool safely,
• You climb facing the steps.
• You do not stretch or lean forward.
• You only reach for items that are directly in front of you.
• You try to have someone nearby in case of emergency.
You should be able to stand on the top step and still have a
firm grasp on the handrail. Don’t become a statistic! Use and choose wisely.
“An Independent Step” fulfills all these requirements
and MUCH MORE.

We offer a one-year replacement warranty on all our products if failure due to

WHICH MODEL?
“An
Independent Step” has six models, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 inch platform heights.
The number represents the height from the surface to the top
of the “Step” platform. The best method is to measure this ground to platform top  and divide this number in half and that determines which “An
Independent Step” model needed. (Example: You take the measurement described
above and it is 16 inches. The 8-inch model would be my suggestion as the 16 inches
is reduced to 2 doable 8-inch steps.) NOTE:
This platform height should also be no more than the height the main user can
easily achieve. Steps at home are normally 8 inches tall so you can use a
regular step to analyze the abilities of the potential users.
Some
venues do not fit my method above. The mini-buses and tour buses make use of
the 5-inch “step” to shorten the last step while adding stability with the
handrails during exiting and entering. For example my mother required a 5 inch
step to get in her Crown Victoria due to the lack of flexibility in her knees.
One 90 year-old gentlemen bought a 5 inch step to get in and out of his sunken
living room (remember those) which was an 8 inch step and he could not achieve
safely. If unsure about model needed, contact me for assistance. We strive to
sell you the most appropriate model for end user.
Recently
the necessity for a two-step model has become apparent. A church has a higher van
with a first step of 23.5 inches. I will complete this two-step prototype after
this crowdfunding is completed. Should a two-step be needed currently you nest
a 5 and 10 inch model to navigate 15 inches if needed.

SCRIPT - VIDEO


My name is Stephen
Bradshaw, President and founder of Bradshaw Solutions, L.L.C. There is a large and growing number of
elderly, disabled, and obese people in our communities. These somewhat immobile persons struggle to get into vehicles
such as church vans and other situations
requiring a step.  They want to participate in activities, but because of
their physical disabilities it has become unsafe, extremely difficult or
impossible for them to enter or exit a van and join their friends. This can be problematic,
especially if these individuals are trying to get to medical facilities for
treatments or checkups, and preventing them from getting services they need. Today’s
stepstools do not offer the stability or weight limits required for today’s
population. Typical stepstools are not sturdy, creating a potential for
an accidental injury.  
We
would like to use this opportunity to show our solution, a stepstool which
weighs only sixteen pounds with handrails and a five hundred weight limit, “An
Independent Step.” Our product is a totally unique and innovative stepstool.
“An Independent Step” is so unique and innovative that nothing even remotely
similar can be found on the Internet. Our innovations are the greatest
improvements on stepstools since a fourth leg was added to the three leg model.
What
makes “An Independent Step” different from other steps in the marketplace? This step composition of aluminum
results in “An Independent Step” amazingly weighing only sixteen pounds making
handling manageable by nearly everyone. The use of aluminum and the
construction design result in a robust weight limit of five hundred pounds. The
standard weight limit for most stepstools is two hundred fifty pounds or less.
Our step is produced totally of aluminum. The
worry of UV deterioration of the plastic versions is eliminated totally. Uniquely
our step has two handrails providing added stability for the user. These
handrails are also removable from the base to make storage and travel much
easier. 
“An Independent Step” uses runners instead of
legs. The runners provide eight times
the surface area platform to ground contact allowing our step to be used in
dirt, grass, or sand without sinking into the surface. The runners extending
outside the platform increase forward and backward stability. Runners are also on
the edge of the side of the platform to supply more right and left stability.
The
three years of developing our product, “An Independent Step”, has been worthwhile
because it helps restore people’s independence in their daily activities.
Through the years our bodies change in ways that may restrict our activities
due to development of disabilities great and small. This restriction of
activities may ultimately result in obesity and loss of the feeling of
independence. 
You
find yourself dependent on others for the smallest tasks such as entering a
vehicle to go to the doctor or some other venue. Some doctors have concluded
people may break their hip while straining to enter high ground clearance
vehicles or other situations. The break may proceed the fall due to the straining
to perform a task. We all know someone who needs and would benefit from “An
Independent Step.” This person may be in your family or not. It could be your
parents, grandparents, or yourself.  
An
Independent Step” is not just for high ground clearance vehicles. Often new
step uses are found by our customers such as getting into today’s higher beds
or reaching items on shelves.  
We are
proud of our product and now are educating the world to the need, existence and
usage of this innovative invention, “An Independent Step.” Join us on the
momentous and rewarding journey of sustaining or returning independence to
everyone.
“We not only stand behind our step” 
Then stand up on the step and say,
“We stand on it.”

helping the world regain independence, click the “Contribute” button. Thank you
for your time.

<p>Do you  know why certain USB cables are unable to charge your mobile handsets. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Some cables can charge but at a very slow rate, some just work as fine as the original USB cable that come with your phone, and some can even charge faster than the original cable. lets understand Why this happens.  </span></p>
<p><span>There are
5 wires inside the USB 1 and USB 2 cables, and there are more inside USB
3.0 cable. Since most of the mobile phones nowadays are using USB 2.0 connector,
so USB 3.0 is out of our topic here.</span></p>
<p><b>The 5 wires are:</b></p>
<p><b>· 2x 28 AWG data lines</b></p>
<p>· 2 x
20-28 AWG power conductors</p>
<p>· 1x
drain wire</p>
<p>and those 5 wires
are connected to the 5 pins in your micro-USB connector.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, there are two kinds of USB cable:<b>fully-rated and sub-channel.</b>The main difference between them is
that fully-rated cable can be used for typical peripherals operating at the
rate of 480 Mbps (high speed) signaling, while the sub-channel one at the
rate of 1.5 Mbps (standard speed) signaling. The construction inside the
cable fully-rated and sub-channel cable is different.</p>
<p>The first code is
normally the specification of the data signal pair, which is normally <b>28 AWG.
""2C"" means 2 conductors, and ""1P"" or ""1Pr"" means
1 pair. ""2C"" and ""1P""</b> are basically the
same. It turns out that the <strong>wire</strong> thickness
used inside the cable impacts on the resistance of the cable assembly – this
resistance causes energy loss inside the cable when an attached load draws a
current, <strong>and causes a voltage drop</strong> which
can reduce the voltage to the end device <strong>to a point where it is not
possible to charge quickly or completely</strong><br/>
<br/>
The important part is the second code, which is the specification of the power
distribution pair. The minimum requirement is 28 AWG, and <b>the
lower the AWG number the better. This is because lower AWG wire is thicker, and therefore the electrical
resistant is lower.</b></p>

In this system, <strong>larger numbers indicate thinner wires</strong>. As the USB specification makes reference to AWG numbers of 20, 22, 24, 26 and 28, calculations were performed for these AWG figures.</p><p><a href=""http://cdn1.goughlui.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/USB-Cable-Resistance-Data-in-Calculations.png"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt=""USB Cable Resistance Data in Calculations"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-9952 lazy"" data-src=""http://goughlui.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/USB-Cable-Resistance-Data-in-Calculations.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p><p>The data used in calculations is summarized above. The conductor resistance is taken from Wikipedia and assumes a <strong>copper</strong> conductor. The USB contact resistance of 30mohm is a “middle of the road” figure – many connectors specify 10mohm when new, and 30mohm through their lifetime, although 50mohm is acceptable for micro connectors.</p><p>The voltage drop is derived from ohm’s law – Voltage = Current * Resistance.</p><p>The resistance itself is calculated by the <strong>route length</strong> which is twice the length of the cable (as current travels from the charger to the device <strong>and back</strong>). For the one with contact resistance, <strong>four times the contact resistance is added</strong> to compensate for the charger positive, device positive, device negative and charger negative contacts.</p><p>This figure is in mohms, and is divided by 1000 to get to ohms, and then finally multiplied by current in amps to get the voltage drop.</p><h2><strong>The Results</strong></h2><p>The results are color coded as to their voltage loss. For a  <strong>5V output</strong>, the USB specification demands that the voltage remains within 5% (i.e. an acceptable voltage drop of 0.25v). All voltage drops less than 0.25v are colour coded <strong>green</strong>. From there, voltage drops of between 0.25v up to 0.5v are colour coded <strong>yellow</strong>. This is because, while the USB specifications are stringent, <strong>most devices only require 4.2v – 4.35v at the battery to fully charge.</strong> Most chargers are of the linear or buck (step-down) type, and thus the supply voltage <strong>must</strong> be greater than the battery voltage for charging to happen. Accounting for losses in the charging circuit, it is determined that <strong>approximately 4.5v is required to ensure a full charge</strong>. Any losses greater than 0.5v are colored <strong>red</strong>, as they are likely to cause problems.</p><p><strong>With Contact Resistance</strong></p><p><a href=""http://cdn1.goughlui.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/USB-Cable-Resistance-with-Contact-Resistance.png"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt=""USB Cable Resistance with Contact Resistance"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-9954 lazy"" data-src=""http://goughlui.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/USB-Cable-Resistance-with-Contact-Resistance.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p><p>With contact resistance taken into account, it can be seen that it is <strong>difficult</strong> to meet requirements at high currents of 2A and 2.4A. As a result, cables only up to about 50 cm can be used with 24 AWG, or maybe even 1M with boosted source voltage. This is most significant for tablets.</p><p>For smartphones, with a requirement closer to 1 A, 24 AWG wires up to 2M could be sufficient, or 1 M at 26 AWG, and 50 cm at 28 AWG.</p><p>However, at 500 mA (the original spec), it can be seen that it is possible to meet the stringent USB voltage requirement at every length with 20 AWG wire, and 2M with 24 AWG (probably by design).</p><p>The disadvantage of pushing more current at low voltages is very clear – the resistance causes <strong>power loss</strong> very quickly!</p><p>A corollary of this is that if you have a <strong>3M cable, of 24 AWG</strong>, then it’s <strong>likely</strong> your charge current is not going to exceed 1A (it’s probably 500mA-1A) purely because of the voltage drop that is caused by the cable.</p><p><strong>Without Contact Resistance</strong></p><p><a href=""http://cdn1.goughlui.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/USB-Cable-Resistance-Negating-Contact-Resistance.png"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt=""USB Cable Resistance Negating Contact Resistance"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-9953 lazy"" data-src=""http://goughlui.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/USB-Cable-Resistance-Negating-Contact-Resistance.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p><p>If we assume that connector resistance isn't part of the equation, and look at the wires itself, the situation is a little less stringent, at high currents, but still illustrates the difficulty in keeping voltage drop under control.</p><p><strong>One caveat of this</strong>, is that some vendors have realized the issue and decided to <strong>push</strong> the output voltage up to 5.1v or 5.2v, which <strong>is still within USB specification</strong> but allows for an extra 0.1-0.2v voltage drop. This is a<strong> potentially nice</strong> feature as it means the requirements on the cables are <strong>slightly</strong> relaxed (i.e. maybe even 0.7v voltage drop is tolerable).</p><p>It is also possible to see higher charge currents at the expense of voltage drop <strong>when the cell is fully discharged at 3v</strong>, as a ~3.2v input would be enough to start charging. Likewise, as the cell reaches full charge, the current tapers off, thus reducing the voltage drop. This might be happening already with some cables “pushing” what is possible. You know when it’s pushed too far when it doesn't <em>consistently</em> charge fully (i.e. stuck at 94%, when eliminating all other issues). <b>""ARTICLE Ends""</b></p><br/>
<p><b>We love to challenge ourselves and During

ALERT CABLE STORY</b></p><br/>
<p>Hi,
I’m Moazzam Loynmoon, the Designer of the TALKING ALERT cable I’ have been
designing &amp; marketing Test &amp; measurement Instruments like
Oscilloscopes, Signal generators etc So we are not here to ask for your
valuable time &amp; money, unless and until we have the prototype and working
model of the product with all necessary testing and certifications in place.</p>
<p>.My
father started the company International Electronics in 1957. We have supplied
to DEFENCE, Bhabha Atomic Research Center (B.A.R.C.) TATA Institute of
Fundamental Research(T.I.F.R), to name a few.</p>
<p>In
Those days itself our products were very unique. My dad was also very
innovative, In 80’s we supplied Signal generators to PHILIPS in their brand
name. Since the time I turned 11 years of age after school I used to assist my
dad and learnt a lot as a kid. For the past 40 years designing instruments using innovation &amp; aesthetics  has been my passion.&amp; I make sure that all my product designs
are user friendly My computer based instruments software is also designed to be
user friendly.</p>
<p>In
the year 2010 my Son Hussain Loynmoon graduated with Telecom Engineering Degree
and Allwind Technologies was born, With him joining me We ventured into Renewable Energy Product &amp; Solutions, we
ventured into LED, SOLAR, &amp; Wind Power and started manufacturing LED
lighting and executing SOLAR and Wind Power projects. With joining of Pranav
Sayta in 2014 to our team and he having almsot 16 years of thinking out of Box we added  Innovative Mobile Accessories designing &amp;
development, Our first product was SLIM PB 42 (slimmest power bank in world at
just 4.16 mm &amp; 2000 mAh lithium Polymer Battery.with charging of 1.5 A
against normal 1 A in most power banks) it was indeed a challenge to make it so
slim and with inbuilt cable.this has been recently launched. In India and
shortly being introduced across the Globe in coming months )</p>
<p>In short <b>""The word impossible, does not exist in my dictionary, I will
not sell something which I myself would not be willing to buy""</b>. I want my products to perform beyond your expectations.</p>
<p>The
idea for the Talking alert cable came to Hussain from one of the most common
problems faced by him, while charging mobile handsets. Most of us normally
charge our mobile handsets by connecting to a power socket/power bank during the
day or night, however if the charger is not connected properly or there is a problem
in the socket connection /handset connection, or after connection, you simply
forget to switch the charger on. This results in the handset not being charged fully
or not charged at all.</p>
<p>Naturally,
We as a team decided to create a Talking Alert Cable which would give Voice Alerts in the English language every 15 minutes. Every time you connect the USB or Micro USB/iPhone connector to the Handset/Socket,
and also rather than looking at the mobile screen just press a small touch
button, which will speak out the charging time elapsed.</p>
<p>I
have seen my father waking up in middle of night, and checking once or twice to
see if the phone is charging or not, and thus disturbing his sleep . In this day and age we cannot think of being without an operational Mobile Handset.  We discussed and decided to create a solution.</p>
<p>Looking
at the market, no competition existed, but we are committed to giving the best
possible product at the most economical price. It has taken us  6 months to get the
TALKING alert cable to this level. We didn’t want to start the campaign until
we had a functional prototype with added SuperFast charging cable that was
approaching completion. Otherwise we’d be letting you down. We want this cable
to become indispensable to such a degree that you will start recommending the cable to all your friends and family to ensure that they have worry free sleep at
night.</p>
<p><b>So, where's the money going?</b></p>
<p>Production
and Shipping.</p>
<p><span>All
the Leg Work is complete. Now we have to put it into production. All Quality
vendors have been finalized. Sequence of Purchase.  Quality control,
Assembly and Final Testing is in place. Your money will be utilized in Purchase
of raw material, Production, QC, Shipping costs, Warehousing Cost, as well as certification of the final

Myths/Facts  regarding SUPER FAST charging cable function 
Do you  know why certain USB cables are unable to charge your mobile handsets. Some cables can charge but at a very slow rate, some just work as fine as the original USB cable that come with your phone, and some can even charge faster than the original cable. lets understand Why this happens.  
There are
5 wires inside the USB 1 and USB 2 cables, and there are more inside USB
3.0 cable. Since most of the mobile phones nowadays are using USB 2.0 connector,
so USB 3.0 is out of our topic here.
The 5 wires are:
· 2x 28 AWG data lines
· 2 x
20-28 AWG power conductors
· 1x
drain wire
and those 5 wires
are connected to the 5 pins in your micro-USB connector.

In fact, there are two kinds of USB cable:fully-rated and sub-channel.The main difference between them is
that fully-rated cable can be used for typical peripherals operating at the
rate of 480 Mbps (high speed) signaling, while the sub-channel one at the
rate of 1.5 Mbps (standard speed) signaling. The construction inside the
cable fully-rated and sub-channel cable is different.
The first code is
normally the specification of the data signal pair, which is normally 28 AWG.
""2C"" means 2 conductors, and ""1P"" or ""1Pr"" means

used inside the cable impacts on the resistance of the cable assembly – this
resistance causes energy loss inside the cable when an attached load draws a

can reduce the voltage to the end device to a point where it is not

The important part is the second code, which is the specification of the power
distribution pair. The minimum requirement is 28 AWG, and the
lower the AWG number the better. This is because lower AWG wire is thicker, and therefore the electrical
resistant is lower.
Therefore, charging
with a ""28AWG/1P + 28AWG/2C"" USB cable is normally slower than a""28AWG/1P +

For Best Result 20

Here is Technical explanation Why
28/20 AWG cable is Best (even at 5 Meters in 20 AWG cable there is negligibe Voltage
Drop ) Please See Below. It is technical in nature, However Gough Lui  has explained in a most simple manner.  Some selected text from his blog (with his permission) is reproduced below to explan users the importance of a Quality Cable.

The USB contact resistance of 30mohm is a “middle of the road” figure – many connectors specify 10mohm when new, and 30mohm through their lifetime, although 50mohm is acceptable for micro connectors.The voltage drop is derived from ohm’s law – Voltage = Current * Resistance.The resistance itself is calculated by the route length which is twice the length of the cable (as current travels from the charger to the device and back). For the one with contact resistance, four times the contact resistance is added to compensate for the charger positive, device positive, device negative and charger negative contacts.This figure is in mohms, and is divided by 1000 to get to ohms, and then finally multiplied by current in amps to get the voltage drop.The ResultsThe results are color coded as to their voltage loss. For a  5V output, the USB specification demands that the voltage remains within 5% (i.e. an acceptable voltage drop of 0.25v). All voltage drops less than 0.25v are colour coded green. From there, voltage drops of between 0.25v up to 0.5v are colour coded yellow. This is because, while the USB specifications are stringent, most devices only require 4.2v – 4.35v at the battery to fully charge. Most chargers are of the linear or buck (step-down) type, and thus the supply voltage must be greater than the battery voltage for charging to happen. Accounting for losses in the charging circuit, it is determined that approximately 4.5v is required to ensure a full charge. Any losses greater than 0.5v are colored red, as they are likely to cause problems.With Contact ResistanceWith contact resistance taken into account, it can be seen that it is difficult to meet requirements at high currents of 2A and 2.4A. As a result, cables only up to about 50 cm can be used with 24 AWG, or maybe even 1M with boosted source voltage. This is most significant for tablets.For smartphones, with a requirement closer to 1 A, 24 AWG wires up to 2M could be sufficient, or 1 M at 26 AWG, and 50 cm at 28 AWG.However, at 500 mA (the original spec), it can be seen that it is possible to meet the stringent USB voltage requirement at every length with 20 AWG wire, and 2M with 24 AWG (probably by design).The disadvantage of pushing more current at low voltages is very clear – the resistance causes power loss very quickly!A corollary of this is that if you have a 3M cable, of 24 AWG, then it’s likely your charge current is not going to exceed 1A (it’s probably 500mA-1A) purely because of the voltage drop that is caused by the cable.Without Contact ResistanceIf we assume that connector resistance isn't part of the equation, and look at the wires itself, the situation is a little less stringent, at high currents, but still illustrates the difficulty in keeping voltage drop under control.One caveat of this, is that some vendors have realized the issue and decided to push the output voltage up to 5.1v or 5.2v, which is still within USB specification but allows for an extra 0.1-0.2v voltage drop. This is a potentially nice feature as it means the requirements on the cables are slightly relaxed (i.e. maybe even 0.7v voltage drop is tolerable).It is also possible to see higher charge currents at the expense of voltage drop when the cell is fully discharged at 3v, as a ~3.2v input would be enough to start charging. Likewise, as the cell reaches full charge, the current tapers off, thus reducing the voltage drop. This might be happening already with some cables “pushing” what is possible. You know when it’s pushed too far when it doesn't consistently charge fully (i.e. stuck at 94%, when eliminating all other issues). ""ARTICLE Ends""
We love to challenge ourselves and During
Prototype testing we decided to use only UL approved 28/20 AWG  cable for
this project. (as with UL approval the Quality Is guaranteed and no markup or fake is possible). Also Europe, US, Canada, Australia give higher mileage and acceptance to UL approved Products.

Where Are We With The Development?
As of today, we have
finalized completely the electronics, PCB design, Cable Gauge &
Supplier/Manufacturer  etc  of the TALKING ALERT CABLE  The Cable
28/20 with Audio Alerts in English has been tested and is working. In plain
English: we have the unit, it works well, and we are going to keep making it
better. This isn't a product in  Air; it’s a device that we have been
using ourselves for past 60 days and given to BETA testers also, without any complaints  We have been
Looking at Improvising the cable, connectors & add more languages to make even
better, before it is finally delivered . We’re perfectionists. You’re putting
your money into a device that even in its current state can be shipped and there will be takers for the same,. Not us. We have our Goodwill of 5 Decades at stake.Below is The Our R &D Labs  and Testing Area
Okay, enough about
the Product and Features. We have been working on Innovative and path Breaking
The Industrial design is complete, and most of the pictures you see above are
real.  What you see is what you get  - but it’ll be much better after
the tooling will be made  and the parts will be injected.Our Major
challenge is USB connector Design  
As far as the PCB Engineering &
design d goes, we are in the last stages of tweaking and improving it. We have
UL approved cable in Place, MFI Application & connectors Ordered (MFI
Connectors are same and required for LED charge Indicator cable and Cube 16
Power Banks www.allivaglobal.com)  and now only looking at
improvising.Long before our anticipated delivery date of the ALLIVA TALKING ALERT cable in June
1st Week, we will have completed and fully tested our product. 
We will be Using Gold Plated Connectors, at both ends and FLAT
tangle free cable in Black and White colors (maybe other Colors can be
considered later) (your Suggestion and feedback is Important to us)
This is the Cable we have finalized, We  want to offer you the best and now looking at offering Silicon Covered USB connector as the connector needs to have speaker cut out and a small button. Only the USB connector we are looking at improvising any suggestions or comments will be appreciated. Silicon/or Gloss finish?   The MICRO USB/iPhone 5/6 Connector we have frozen on white Plastic Body with Blue LED Ring at end. LED glows while phone is charging and shuts off when charging stops. 
TALKING
ALERT CABLE STORY
Hi,
I’m Moazzam Loynmoon, the Designer of the TALKING ALERT cable I’ have been
designing & marketing Test & measurement Instruments like
Oscilloscopes, Signal generators etc So we are not here to ask for your
valuable time & money, unless and until we have the prototype and working
model of the product with all necessary testing and certifications in place.
.My
father started the company International Electronics in 1957. We have supplied
to DEFENCE, Bhabha Atomic Research Center (B.A.R.C.) TATA Institute of
Fundamental Research(T.I.F.R), to name a few.
In
Those days itself our products were very unique. My dad was also very
innovative, In 80’s we supplied Signal generators to PHILIPS in their brand
name. Since the time I turned 11 years of age after school I used to assist my
dad and learnt a lot as a kid. For the past 40 years designing instruments using innovation & aesthetics  has been my passion.& I make sure that all my product designs
are user friendly My computer based instruments software is also designed to be
user friendly.
In
the year 2010 my Son Hussain Loynmoon graduated with Telecom Engineering Degree
and Allwind Technologies was born, With him joining me We ventured into Renewable Energy Product & Solutions, we
ventured into LED, SOLAR, & Wind Power and started manufacturing LED
lighting and executing SOLAR and Wind Power projects. With joining of Pranav
Sayta in 2014 to our team and he having almsot 16 years of thinking out of Box we added  Innovative Mobile Accessories designing &
development, Our first product was SLIM PB 42 (slimmest power bank in world at
just 4.16 mm & 2000 mAh lithium Polymer Battery.with charging of 1.5 A
against normal 1 A in most power banks) it was indeed a challenge to make it so
slim and with inbuilt cable.this has been recently launched. In India and
shortly being introduced across the Globe in coming months )
In short ""The word impossible, does not exist in my dictionary, I will
not sell something which I myself would not be willing to buy"". I want my products to perform beyond your expectations.
The
idea for the Talking alert cable came to Hussain from one of the most common
problems faced by him, while charging mobile handsets. Most of us normally
charge our mobile handsets by connecting to a power socket/power bank during the
day or night, however if the charger is not connected properly or there is a problem
in the socket connection /handset connection, or after connection, you simply
forget to switch the charger on. This results in the handset not being charged fully
or not charged at all.
Naturally,
We as a team decided to create a Talking Alert Cable which would give Voice Alerts in the English language every 15 minutes. Every time you connect the USB or Micro USB/iPhone connector to the Handset/Socket,
and also rather than looking at the mobile screen just press a small touch
button, which will speak out the charging time elapsed.
I
have seen my father waking up in middle of night, and checking once or twice to
see if the phone is charging or not, and thus disturbing his sleep . In this day and age we cannot think of being without an operational Mobile Handset.  We discussed and decided to create a solution.
Looking
at the market, no competition existed, but we are committed to giving the best
possible product at the most economical price. It has taken us  6 months to get the
TALKING alert cable to this level. We didn’t want to start the campaign until
we had a functional prototype with added SuperFast charging cable that was
approaching completion. Otherwise we’d be letting you down. We want this cable
to become indispensable to such a degree that you will start recommending the cable to all your friends and family to ensure that they have worry free sleep at
night.
So, where's the money going?
Production
and Shipping.
All
the Leg Work is complete. Now we have to put it into production. All Quality
vendors have been finalized. Sequence of Purchase.  Quality control,
Assembly and Final Testing is in place. Your money will be utilized in Purchase
of raw material, Production, QC, Shipping costs, Warehousing Cost, as well as certification of the final
product. Please note our shipping costs will be high since material is to be
shipped from INDIA. We intend to expedite the process of manufacture and
delivery so that you get maximum benefits.   We shall not let you
down.
THE RISK AND
CHALLENGES
Our experienced team has developed many complex
products in the last 45 years. Moazzam Loynmoon, our founder has spent 45 years
in designing, sourcing and manufacturing products , 
Recently We just completed the Slimmest Power Bank project  (SLIM PB 42 & CUBE 16 Power banks with
Micro USB and Apple iPhone 5/6 (8 pin Lightning connectors MFI Approved). We
have been working on Alliva Talking Alert cable for past 6 months . Throughout
the course of R&D, we have created several iterations &  prototypes and
have continuously improved their functionality and quality. 
We have a team of 14 people working in R & D at Allwind Technologies
& SIGNET.
We understand that Indiegogo backers want their ALLIVA Talking
Alert Cable as soon as possible, and on time, but perfection  is at the top
of the list. Even though we are confident of meeting our deadline for delivery, there
are always unforeseen circumstances, or minor changes that could cause
delays. We will always be here & never fail to answer your questions,
We are dedicated to our timeline and ALLIVA TALKING Cable’s
quality, and will keep you informed on the status of our the project’s progress
at regular Intervals by email and will continue to send further updates as we
have them. We are committed to being transparent and keeping ALLIVA Talking
Cable fans and Indiegogo backers informed.",14.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>MiniMe</b> is <span><span><span>a
portable high-end boombox totally sustainable, wireless and funky,
but with character. It is </span></span></span>designed
and built to last for many years with all the modern functionalities
in mind but with high aesthetics as well. Its housing is made
entirely with solid wood and is customizable to a great extend. It
may seem small but the sound it produces is powerful. It
is like having two full-range HiFi speakers in one! <b>MiniMe</b>
is here to beat reality. What you'll get, modestly speaking, is even
better from what you see. It is truly a piece of art!</p>

production equipment and this is where some delay may occur. FULFILLMENT: Despite our best planning, there may be factors
that we cannot control such as equipment malfunction, transport delays or supplier setbacks. Moreover, If more people than we anticipate make purchases we may have to scale up the production process and hire more personnel. We are ready to work hard to produce MiniMes the quickest possible and ensure that the early backers are given priority to receive their goodies.ADDITIONAL ADJUSTMENTS: Although extensive testing on the design and liability of the product has taken place over the past two years and we think we have
a product that is ready for the market, there will always be new things to add to reach perfection. New adjustments along the way are possible in order to deliver the highest quality to all of our supporters. This will result
in a better product but may delay production or shipment in some
cases.

The
team behind MiniMe is
a bunch of guys full of love with what they do and fully in love with
technology, high-end constructions and passion for music and High Fidelity. Each member of the team has their own technical background
and every bit of their knowledge is filtered and distilled into their
products. 

Although
MiniMe is our very
first official product on the market, as a team we have spent the
last 5 years experimenting with High-Definition Audio as a hobby in
our free time. Throughout this process of endless R&D we have
designed and built from scratch (3) pairs of ultra High-Definition
Electrostatic speakers and our current love MiniMe!

<p>Regarding Poco®, in the words of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Hauser"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hermann Hauser</a> (founder of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ARM</a>, a company who have sold over 50 Billion micro processors and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_Computers"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Acorn Computers</a> - whose BBC Micro computers dominated the UK educational computer market during the 1980s): <i><b>""As you would expect from a Sinclair product, it looks very cool"".</b></i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446732977/jgg3qvjinjlvutpqnsx6.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The idea of Poco® was originally conceived some time ago after inventor, (Grant Sinclair, now aged 42, originally from Cambridge) learnt about the amazing success of the easy to use handheld Flip video camera from Pure Digital Technologies which eventually sold in millions of units. Grant's idea was to take aspects of the bulky Flip camera design but improve it by using newer and next generation mobile phone technology to miniaturise the form factor and produce a similar concept but packed into a much neater, credit card size footprint and using high-end build quality inspired by the famous Minox spy camera from 1932. Many of the selected hardware components were way ahead of their time and the smallest or thinnest in the world such as a wafer thin Piezoelectric speaker from Murata of Japan, an energy efficient Active Matrix OLED display module from CMEL of Taiwan and a unique miniature camera module with ultra-fast Autofocus, continuous variable aperture &amp; shutter from Digital Imaging Systems of Germany. The original Poco® concept was very well received and immediately received letters of interest to sell or license from leading camera distributors worldwide - however some of the technology involved was very new and difficult to secure some of these specialist components in reliable volume supply. However, this early success spurred Grant on to re-engineer the Poco® to take advantage of industrial grade components that were more readily available and likely to be around for longer such as a thin type, high contrast IPS display module, a miniature Dynamic speaker from Knowles® and the Raspberry Pi® compute module. At the same time other hardware feature sets were added to take advantage of the open source Raspberry Pi® community such as gaming functionality (to rival the popular Nintendo DS™ handheld console) and 24-bit audio playback &amp; recording functionality (the next generation of hi-resolution sound). </div><div><i>The first crude (3D printed) Poco® prototype proved the initial concept worked:</i></div><div>

<p>Poco® was improved further by adding a standard quarter action mount, making it compatible with many camera mount accessories (car and bike etc) and therefore a stronger potential competitor to the leading GoPro® action camera which has now become the best selling camera in the world.

<p>Our core team of experts have years of experience between us, we also bring in leading consultants in their field when necessary. Because we are a relatively small team, we are fast moving - completing most tasks in-house means we can implement ideas swiftly and effectively, avoiding the unnecessary bureaucratic procedures often imposed on larger organisations (e.g board meetings etc). </p>
<p>The Sinclair design team currently consist of the following members:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grant - Inventor, Designer &amp; CEO</li>
<li>Cassiel - Creative Partner, education &amp; funding advisor</li>
<li>Nigel - Electronics Designer specialising in tablet hardware &amp; PCB architecture</li>
<li>Chris - Electronics Manager, including regulatory compliance</li>
<li>Andrew - CAD engineer &amp; Production Manager</li>
<li>Jack - Film and Music production, editing</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, two of the largest electronics component distributors in the world (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_Farnell"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Premier Farnell plc</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS_Components"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">RS Components</a>) have both offered to support Sinclair by overlooking the manufacturing of Poco® including introductions to relevant manufacturing partners e.g <a href=""http://www.sonypencoed.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sony® of Wales</a> in UK (one of the key manufacturers of the original and current Raspberry Pi® product range).</p>
<h1>Where are we with the project regarding timeline for completion?</h1>
<p>We estimated at the outset that the complete Poco® electronics development would take around 32 weeks. So far we have completed the PCB schematics and are close to finishing the PCB design files for pre-production, therefore around 15 weeks into the project. The next stage is to produce a pilot batch of PCBs for pre-production manufacture which power up and allow basic operation, ready for compliance testing. As soon as we receive cleared funds from Indiegogo, we can order the metal body tooling which has a lead time of 7-9 weeks upon approval and then a further 4 weeks upon approval of first article samples.</p>
<h1>What is the funding for?</h1>
<p>The funding is to complete the electronics development, to tool the metal body casing and other ancillary parts. We aim to deliver you a product to the highest quality standards which takes time to get right. </p>
<p>In addition, part of the funding is to be used for extending our current filed intellectual property (UK patent pending and European Design registration) into multiple territories worldwide - our current UK patent pending allows us a period of grace by which to file into other territories, therefore our IP is currently covered worldwide for the short term which should hopefully discourage inferior and low quality (counterfeit) copies entering the market.

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Our team are Sinclair Mobile Ltd, the next generation of Sinclair computing and we are raising funds to take Poco® micro computer from working prototype stage and develop for mass production (UK manufacturing planned).</p>
<p>From experience we have learnt to develop the Poco® using mostly established technology that already works (rather than pie in the sky unproven tech) and have now got all the key features of Poco® running well on the existing prototype. In addition, we have been very careful to select key components that are industrial grade and likely to be around for some time (in an effort to avoid the End Of Life obstacle scenario that hi-tec companies often come up against, when developing innovative new consumer products).</p>
<p>Perhaps the largest risk is with the manufacture of the thin wall body <br/>housing (0.6mm wall thickness) as most suppliers have a limit of 1mm minimal wall thickness. However, we have identified two suppliers who specialise in thin wall housings (one of which is a Tier 1 level supplier of leading mobile phone brands) and both suppliers are very confident they can achieve the wall thickness we need.</p>
<p>Because we are pushing the boundaries of how many electronic components can be crammed inside Poco's casing (over 400 parts), we had some initial concerns regarding the build-up of heat inside the case. We therefore engineered Poco's casing to double as a heat sink and have successfully tested the device, including with running the CPU at a much faster rate (enabling overclocking, therefore faster processing) - we have since filed patents protecting our intellectual property in this and several other aspects of the product design &amp; engineering.</p>
<p>Another problem is tracking the multi-layer PCB so it hooks up all the ancillary components. For this we have come up with a very neat multi-layer, flex-rigid PCB solution that connects everything together and our engineers have vast experience of designing these type of PCB stacks. We are currently talking to Sony in Wales, UK plus other leading blue chip OEMs regarding manufacturing the Poco®.</p>
<p>We also need to get Poco® to be EMI compliant, so it doesn't interfere with other electrical devices. Whilst this is usually a relatively straight forward process, it requires expert knowledge and can be expensive to implement as often requires many stages of rigorous testing to get the product to a shipping state. Other regulatory standards that need implementing include CE marking plus RTTE, EMC, ROHS and WEEE directives. Poco's electronics will need to be tested to comply with IEC EN 60950 safety standards. This will be a key stage in the process of getting Poco® to you.</p>
<p>Coming from the Sinclair family of inventors and with a background in product design (including electronics miniaturisation), helps because we have the experience and industry contacts to bring a product like Poco® to life. With the right level of funding, we are certain to deliver our campaign supporters a quality product that is high tech to the highest spec and packed with cool and cutting edge features.</p>

What are we looking for? The 2 founders have already invested 160,000€ in LM Sport Tourism. We are now looking at raising 500,000€ of funding through Indiegogo, bank loans and of course our own money. As every contribution helps, small or big, we have special perks for every level of investment (see on the side). If you cannot contribute with large amounts but like our project, do not hesitate to: 
talk about the project using the Indiegogo sharing tools,
share the Runnin’City page on Facebook or Twitter,
download the app and rate it on the App Store.
As we mentioned earlier, your funding will greatly help us deliver our strategy faster than we could without you. And you know how speed of delivery can make a difference in the digital age.  We sincerely hope you will help us meet our funding objectives. What if we do not reach our funding objectives? If we do not reach our funding objectives, the available funding will go in priority towards marketing the application in as many countries around the world as possible, starting with Europe, North America and Oceania. Are there any risks? As with any business venture, there are obviously risks and challenges. However, to date, we have already achieved all our objectives on time. We have no intention to miss the next ones. We have self funded and spent the last 9 months:
validating the interest of our concept,
building our vision,
designing the business plan & marketing strategies,
recruiting the 7-strong team,
creating a unique and extremely productive methodology to build great routes around the world,
Selling a branded app (white label) to several cities and hotel groups. 
We have solved all technology issues & are fully organised. We have already raised over 100,000€ of funding through friends and family. But more importantly, we have delivered the second major version of our iOS application, and it is rated 5 stars in the Apple App Store. Version 3 is already underway.Our management and technical teams have already had great successes marketing consumer and business goods around the world: toys, the Recaro Zen baby pram and several software products. Thanks to our experience, amazing motivation, the skills and expertise of our team and a lot of sweat, we believe we will also be successful with this new exciting venture. The more you contribute all together, the more likely we will reduce the biggest risk for our company: a too slow adoption or the arrival of a competitor.What the press says about Runnin'City:

<strong>
</strong><p>iMARVEL is finished by 9 steps of processes and one of the most important processes is to test the limit of weight that iMARVEL can stand.</p>
<p>We will tell you the hidden story about the weight of the product that can be stuck to iMARVEL during the development.</p>
<p>Do you know the weight of the heaviest smartphone?</p>
<p>iPhone6 Plus - 172g </p>
<p>Galaxy Note5 - 171g</p>
<p>We guess that the weight of the heaviest smartphone equipped with all possible cases and covers will not exceed 230g.</p>
<p>What we have used during the development was an iron mock-up that resembles a smartphone case.</p>
<strong>
</strong><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464844152/main23_gt8d3h.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<strong>
</strong><p></p>
<strong>
</strong><p></p>
<strong>
</strong><p>Have you ever seen a smartphone case made of iron? We guess that you have never ever seen such a thing.</p>
<p>Give it a try to guess the weight of the iron smartphone case.</p>
<p>We had two iron smartphone cases. The first one weighed 405g and the other one weighed 414g.</p>
<strong>
</strong><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464844353/main24_djqqcq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
</div>
<p>The picture shows the iron smartphone case stuck to iMARVEL. It didn’t fall off from iMARVEL once being stuck to it.</p>
<p>So it would be absolutely fine with iMARVEL no matter what kind of smartphones you use.</p>

You may use something to which you can attach your goods and keep using it in that way. But if you need something detachable, iMARVEL will be your one and only solution in the world.
We have participated in this campaign so that we can secure funding to produce of patented materials and print required for iMarvel.





 



iMarvel is a versatile, practical and aesthetically good looking product that will bring extra convenience to your life.
iMarvel will make you enjoy the freedom to use both of your hands while putting your smartphone on a smooth and flat surface in different places and situations of your life and its stylish design will also serve as part of your interior props.

You can use iMARVEL in every place of your lifestyle.

You can also use iMARVEL in kitchen, bathroom, living room and on dressing table and it will bring whole new convenience to you when using in your car. In addition, iMARVEL is a magic pad available for any kind of places including offices and stores.
















iMarvel is a collaboration between technical skills of Winic and decent designs of an illustrator named Geumhwang, and part of her artworks applied to iMarvel products are displayed in Creative Talking Gallery at COEX Aquarium.
We have combined convenient functions with paintings by Geumhwang to create iMarvel with handy functions and decent designs.
Geumhwang always thinks of people who will feel comfortable and happy with her works before starting to draw.
So we also hope you can feel comfortable and happy with paintings on iMarvel.







 


 Story behind the development of iMARVEL








iMARVEL is finished by 9 steps of processes and one of the most important processes is to test the limit of weight that iMARVEL can stand.
We will tell you the hidden story about the weight of the product that can be stuck to iMARVEL during the development.
Do you know the weight of the heaviest smartphone?
iPhone6 Plus - 172g 
Galaxy Note5 - 171g
We guess that the weight of the heaviest smartphone equipped with all possible cases and covers will not exceed 230g.
What we have used during the development was an iron mock-up that resembles a smartphone case.







Have you ever seen a smartphone case made of iron? We guess that you have never ever seen such a thing.
Give it a try to guess the weight of the iron smartphone case.
We had two iron smartphone cases. The first one weighed 405g and the other one weighed 414g.




The picture shows the iron smartphone case stuck to iMARVEL. It didn’t fall off from iMARVEL once being stuck to it.
So it would be absolutely fine with iMARVEL no matter what kind of smartphones you use.


We have performed a variety of tests while producing iMARVEL and we are really happy to share the story behind the development of iMARVEL with you.






iMarvel was designed based on shapes and forms of different smartphones and its both ends were rounded to deliver the feelings of those paintings on it and we have done a series of tests in order to make iMarvel appropriate for all kinds of smartphones with different form factors.













❖ The product colors may differ from what you see on your monitor.






Model : iMARVEL
Size: H75mm X W150mm

iMarvel had a positive result from the tensile adhesion strength test for quality control and also successfully completed tests in compliance with the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS) stipulated by the European Union and common safety guidelines for kid products.


























Remove the protective film on the back, stick it to things made of wood or glass and then remove the protective film on the front.
Press your smartphone on iMarvel ‘a little bit hard’ to make sure that your phone was attached to iMarvel completely and then let the phone hang on it. You will understand what it feels like after a few repetitions.
When you stick your phone in a vertical position, do not let the camera of your phone attached.
Use your both hands when removing your phone from iMarvel.
The backside of iMarvel will gradually be more adhesive.
When you remove iMarvel, make some spaces by holding the both ends and then stripping it off slowly.
Your phone will not be sticky after removing it from iMarvel.

We will participate in this campaign with products of the first collaboration between Winic and one of those artists.




Q 
What kind of smartphones and their cases can I use with iMarvel?


A 
Your smartphone or its cover should have flat backside to put it on iMarvel. Some materials are not proper to stick it to iMarvel. So please check whether your smartphone or its case can be attached to iMarvel before using it.


 
 


Q 
What kind of materials can I stick iMarvel to?


A 
Its backside can be attached to glass, wood, steel, plastic and tiles. However, iMarvel may not be completely attached to such materials without smooth or flat surfaces. So please check the surfaces before using it.


 
 


Q 
How long can my smartphone hold onto iMarvel?


A 
Although your smartphone will not be separated from iMarvel once attached but please remember that iMarvel is not designed to fix your smartphone completely but to hold it for a while. So you need to be careful as its adhesion may gradually become weak.


 
 


Q 
How long can I use iMarvel?


A 
Its durability may vary depending on frequency of repeated use and other environmental factors such as temperature and humidity. So each product may have different durations for use.
  When you feel that the adhesion of iMarvel is not that strong, clean it with water and dry it out to restore its adhesion.


 
 


Q
What payment options do I have?


A
You can pay via credit card or PayPal. Select a perk and you'll see the             available payment methods at checkout.


 
 


Q
How much is shipping and handling?


A
Shipping is FREE worldwide.


 
 


Q
How do I select which iMARVEL I want?


A
If you want specific designs, please let us know it. We can send you products      accordingly.







We can promote works by many artists to the public with this campaign and your money will be used to produce patented materials and print their artworks on iMarvel products.

<h3>An Instrumentation Suite for Your Pocket</h3>
<p>Whether you simply want to know what the air temperature is, or want to do something as complex as continuously monitoring a scientific experiment, the Maker Mod could be for you.  The set of sensors has not been finalized at this point, but on the short list are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Temperature &amp; Humidity</li>
<li>Hall Effect</li>
<li>Air quality / CO2 / VOC</li>
<li>Pulse Oximeter / Particle Count</li>
<li>Photosensor</li>
<li>IR Emitter &amp; Detector</li>
<li>RGB LEDs for notifications</li>
<li>Standard LEDs in an array</li>
<li>Thermocouple inputs</li>
<li>Voltage measurement</li>
<li>Battery Voltage input and output</li>
<li>Solid State Relays for experiment/process control</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Open Source</h3>
<p>On the software side, this mod will have an android app that acts as a simple chart recorder, and display data from selected sensors over time.  But a simple app certainly won't cover all the possible uses for this set of hardware.   As such, we'll be making as much of this mod as possible open source.  That includes the android app, as well as the firmware for the mod's microcontroller.</p>
<p>We'll also try to release as much info about the hardware as possible, such as schematics, gerbers, and component part numbers.  It is however, likely that we'll have to leave out some information about the interface with the phone which Motorola considers proprietary.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact of Your Contribution</h3>
<p>At this early stage, we are just trying to gauge how much interest there is in this Mod, before committing a ton of time and resources to it.  By making a contribution, you'll encourage us to invest in the mod's development and also help pay for the costs of developing a prototype.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>At this point we're definitely interested in any ideas you might have to improve the design of this mod.  Whether there is a specific sensor or other bit of hardware you'd like to have included, or if you just want to let us know what color you'd like the circuit board to be, please feel free to get in touch.</p>

4AMPS is the world's first all-in-one charging solution for your mobile devices. It's the one clutter free and cost effective solution that truly frees up space in your kitchen, office and mind. Never struggle to find your charger before your phone dies again and untangle yourself from the wirey mess left behind in your life and workspace. 4AMPS frees you from your adapter and seamlessly integrates into your home or office. No more need for adapters, cords, power bars, bricks, extra batteries.
4AMPS is a powerful USB charger built into an outlet cover plate with an integrated 3-foot retractable cord and 2-device charging heads. Charges any USB device (smartphones, tablets, phablets, laptops, etc.) and eliminates the need for bulky wall warts or bulky charging stations. It installs in seconds on any standard outlet in your home with no electrician and no wiring. All you need is a screwdriver. For renters, this solution provides convenient wall charging that can be taken with you when you move. If you move out, just pop the old cover back on.
Gaining your support will enable us to ramp up our manufacturing into full production for existing and pending purchase orders, and also create some inventory for direct and Amazon sales, as well as begin development of our next generation smart software and hardware solutions which will further revolutionize device charging.

We embarked on this road thinking that our solution was simple and elegant. What we did not realize was that the scale at which 4AMPS functions mechanically and electronically is both very difficult and complex.
Working almost on the scale of watches with complications, our engineers and designers slaved over perfecting all aspects of the 4AMPS design and function.
It works flawlessly. It looks beautiful.

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We were inspired by the stunning clean design of phones such as the 
iPhone 6 and HTC One M8, and set out to look for docks that would 
beautifully compliment these phones, and we found a few, but there was a
 common problem with them: functionality. We found that they were not 
universal, did not prioritize eco-friendliness, and did not offer enough
 versatility, thus we created MONOLITH. It is designed with 100% 
renewable bamboo wood. MONOLITH is a single
 piece of premium bamboo wood, backed by a sheet of cork</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">, and includes two bamboo dowel rods that can attach to the back to

<p>We do not believe in astronomical markups. In fact, we don't believe 
in markups at all! We are able to have such low prices due to the fact 
that our profit margins are incredibly small, and we are ok with that. 
For instance, it costs us a total of $15 to manufacture and ship 
MONOLITH, yet the cheapest perk package with MONOLITH is just $20! We 
believe in providing premium accessories to our customers at extremely 
affordable prices. We have not yet decided on a retail price point, but 
we do know that the prices we are offering here on INDIEGOGO are 
discounted one-time-only prices. Shipping anywhere in the continental 
United States is free, while shipping everywhere else in the world is an
 extra $20. All shipping is tracked and insured.</p>

<p>We are on INDIEGOGO because we need your help! To lower production 
costs, ensure any unexpected costs are covered, hire additional 
employees to manufacture MONOLITH, and to source quality materials at 
bulk prices, we have a funding goal of $1,000 USD. We saw 
INDIEGOGO as a perfect way to launch our dream, and we have all the 
puzzle pieces in place except for one, you! You are our last piece and 
we hope that by pledging, you can help fit this last piece into our 
puzzle. Although we have Flexible Funding enabled, we have properly adjusted the prices in order to ensure we have enough money to manufacture MONOLITH, even if we do not meet our goal. If we do meet the goal, it should make the manufacturing process a lot quicker, and may allow us to throw in a few free extra features. When contributing, we ask that you share our project on social media, and to your friends and family!<br/></p>

<p>Since 2nd grade, Joe Malzone has had the dream to become an 
entrepreneur, and has worked towards that dream since then. In 7th 
grade, Joe started selling homemade smoothies to neighbors in his 
subdivision, and learned the process of marketing a product and 
calculating manufacturing costs. Two years later, Joe partnered with his
 friend Dan to create an online gaming service called The Hybrix Network
 to provide people around the world with a 24/7 gaming experience. 
Through this service, that is still being run, Joe has learned to manage
 a team of staff, manage customer relations, and troubleshooting 
unexpected problems that arise from daily operations. Now Joe is 
creating a division of the previous company, called Hybrix At Home, 
which has brought about this campaign.</p>

would thrilled to have your support by contributing to our project!

iPhone 6 and HTC One M8, and set out to look for docks that would 
beautifully compliment these phones, and we found a few, but there was a
 common problem with them: functionality. We found that they were not 
universal, did not prioritize eco-friendliness, and did not offer enough
 versatility, thus we created MONOLITH. It is designed with 100% 
renewable bamboo wood. MONOLITH is a single
 piece of premium bamboo wood, backed by a sheet of cork, and includes two bamboo dowel rods that can attach to the back to 
position MONOLITH in multiple orientations. 











Phone sizes up to: 3.5"" wide by 6.5"" tall
MicroUSB and Apple Lightning charging capabilities 
Multiple orientations 
Eco-friendly and sustainable bamboo wood and cork construction
Elegant design

















  






We do not believe in astronomical markups. In fact, we don't believe 
in markups at all! We are able to have such low prices due to the fact 
that our profit margins are incredibly small, and we are ok with that. 
For instance, it costs us a total of $15 to manufacture and ship 
MONOLITH, yet the cheapest perk package with MONOLITH is just $20! We 
believe in providing premium accessories to our customers at extremely 
affordable prices. We have not yet decided on a retail price point, but 
we do know that the prices we are offering here on INDIEGOGO are 
discounted one-time-only prices. Shipping anywhere in the continental 
United States is free, while shipping everywhere else in the world is an
 extra $20. All shipping is tracked and insured.





We are on INDIEGOGO because we need your help! To lower production 
costs, ensure any unexpected costs are covered, hire additional 
employees to manufacture MONOLITH, and to source quality materials at 
bulk prices, we have a funding goal of $1,000 USD. We saw 
INDIEGOGO as a perfect way to launch our dream, and we have all the 
puzzle pieces in place except for one, you! You are our last piece and 
we hope that by pledging, you can help fit this last piece into our 
puzzle. Although we have Flexible Funding enabled, we have properly adjusted the prices in order to ensure we have enough money to manufacture MONOLITH, even if we do not meet our goal. If we do meet the goal, it should make the manufacturing process a lot quicker, and may allow us to throw in a few free extra features. When contributing, we ask that you share our project on social media, and to your friends and family!



Since 2nd grade, Joe Malzone has had the dream to become an 
entrepreneur, and has worked towards that dream since then. In 7th 
grade, Joe started selling homemade smoothies to neighbors in his 
subdivision, and learned the process of marketing a product and 
calculating manufacturing costs. Two years later, Joe partnered with his
 friend Dan to create an online gaming service called The Hybrix Network
 to provide people around the world with a 24/7 gaming experience. 
Through this service, that is still being run, Joe has learned to manage
 a team of staff, manage customer relations, and troubleshooting 
unexpected problems that arise from daily operations. Now Joe is 
creating a division of the previous company, called Hybrix At Home, 
which has brought about this campaign.






We have an amazing team of staff, spread throughout the United States managing technical support, product development, manufacturing, marketing, and much more. We are all very passionate about our work and are devoted to creating the best experience for our customers. 



We would like to thank everyone for checking out this campaign, and 
would thrilled to have your support by contributing to our project!

I don't have the funds to do this and I need your help to make this a reality.
The output of this event will be a marketing video that we will use to sell these services to Marketing Agencies (thank you Square Elephant for helping out on the making of video) through a new company called Crowdshooters.



We are looking to raise £700 to pay for camera hire, software and streaming costs. All the crew are
volunteers and a special thank you to Will Kinder from the BBC for helping out as our live director.
We are really excited about the potential of the technology but we need your help to make this a reality.
This is a world first; streaming a live music show using 15 mobile phones and 3 professional cameras, streamed as a professionally produced show online.
Really appreciate your help on this, and feel welcome to contact me with any questions.
Thanks,

<br/><p>Looking
for funding to get a few computer Immersion cases out to people for product review and product endorsements. Our secondary goal
is funding to move into a larger facility here in the USA.</p>
<p><b>
</b></p><p><b>A little about us, Immersion
technology, and its benefits.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Crypt’N Computer Case Company is an
American manufacturing start up created to develop full immersion computer
cases. Established in 2011 by founder Arlo Christianson and self-funded, he
went to work designing and creating various models and prototypes. All along
coming closer and closer to a product truly revolutionary, one that you will be
using for years to come. Arlo has funded this endeavor up to this point. We
have reached a critical stage now that the utility patents have been prepared
and are now pending. We need capital to go into full production and we need to
build product recognition and awareness. That is where we need your help to
fund a few cases so we can get them out to be reviewed and to build product awareness.
Crypt'N is based in Great Falls Montana. One of our core tenants’ is bringing
manufacturing jobs back to America. </p>
<p>In 2011, during a computer build,
Arlo wanted to submerge the whole computer. He set out to find an immersion
case for his build but was unable to find anything that would work. Needless to
say he was rather disappointed in the lack of available options and was
determined to do something about it. </p>
<p>It was then the decision was made to
start the Crypt’N Computer Case Company for the purpose of bringing immersion
technology to personal computers. The budget has always been tight from the
start, however this would not deter him. He would spend all his extra time and money
over the last four years developing this product, to the point at which it’s
ready for the world. Our patents are now pending and we need your help to fund
the next stage.</p>
<p>Having an immersion case that was
multi fluid capable was one of the most important goals. We’ve had set backs
along the way. One example would be our Prototype 2.5 version. Quickly after
startup we realized there was a problem. The heat was being pulled out of the
case too fast, stress cracks where developing in the acrylic. The system still worked
great as Arlo over-engineered the material thickness of the pressure vessel for
safety. </p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440500373/buchlkjvmni05zkyvh3m.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>(<i>This was awesome, we had an
idea this might be possible but the low boiling point fluid worked better than
we expected.</i>)  <br/>
<br/>
<p>To find a solution we had to
redesign the case to fit our small annealing ovens. This was a good thing which
lead to a more user friendly case design and better quality. However one key
brake through came during testing  was pressurizing the containment area
and cooling system so that the system would work with almost all types of
dielectric fluid, not just the well-known mineral oil but also low boiling
point dielectric fluids. And by holding the increasing pressure in the system
made the low boiling point fluids work better yet. Immersion technology also
helps protect your computer from hazardous and harmful environments by fully
encapsulating your core computer components’. Our immersion cases use single
phase cooling with the option to use external dual phase chillers if lower
temps are needed.</p>
<p><b>Immersion technology</b></p>
<p>Immersion technology has been around
for a long time. First Arlo heard of it being used was in Seymour Cray's super
computers back in the 80's, but it has been around allot longer. It has been
adapted for use in sensitive data systems in large companies, government
entities, and the military. This technology allows those systems to be more
powerful, run faster, be smaller, and last longer. </p>
<p>Immersion technology has a
significant advantage over air in heat transfer ability. Which allows for
denser configurations increasing the amount of electronics per cubic area that
an enclosure can maintain and operate safely. By increasing the cooling
capacity of your PC cases, we allow you to run your components harder, faster
and longer than an air cooled PC is possible of doing.</p>
<p>Another benefit from using our immersion
cases’ is that it seals the computer inside away from harmful environments such
as humidity, smoke and dust. Keeping your computer as clean as the day you put
it in the case.</p>
<p>Best of all you will not void the
warranties on your computer components like some high end water cooled set ups
will. And our immersion cases are multi-generational capable. Meaning you will
be able to change the internal components as you see fit. Now and into the
future. </p>
<p><b>""Crypt'N relegates water cooling to the history books.""</b><br/></p><p>Now you can have this advanced
technology at work for you, in your home or office. Become Elite. Maximize your
computers potential with immersion cooling from Crypt’N. And as the public
embraces immersion technology in their homes and offices, motherboard and CPU
manufacturers will be able to take the restrictions off, on how dense the
electronics can be placed. Which should logically lead to a wider variety of
multiple CPU motherboards and in smaller form factors. Get ahead of this trend
and support us today. Donate to our crowd funding campaign to help us bring
about innovation.</p>
<p></p><b>Our immersion cases include: </b>
<ul>
<li>A lifetime warranty on materials and workmanship and a
     limited replacement warranty on ware parts such as fluid transfer pumps
     and LED's.</li>
<li>Thick impact resistant acrylic view window in the
     pressure vessel.</li>
<li>Black sleeved power and data cables. </li>
<li>Multiple drive bays with case matching covers. </li>
<li>Fluid transfer pump. </li>
<li>High quality heat exchangers. </li>
<li>Pre plumed and tested fluid transfer lines. </li>
<li>Color changing LED fiber optic trim. (<i>On selected
     models only.</i>) </li>
<li>A sealed pressure tank to safely hold and protect your
     computer components.  </li>
<li>Mounting hardware. </li>
<li>Changeable rear I/O pass-through manifold.</li>
<li>Changeable drive bay power and data pass-through
     manifold.</li>
<li>Front side power switch.</li>
<li>Back side reset switch.</li>
<li>Removable dust filter. </li>
<li>Stubbed out quick connects for expanding cooling
     capabilities.</li>
</ul><br/><p>Maintenance has been made easy.
Start by looking through your display window to verify fluid level. Wipe the
outside of case with a soft cloth and some case cleaner then vacuum the front
side dust filter or remove for easy cleaning. (<i>Yea we said vacuum.</i>) We have made the pump accessible, if
it ever needs to be changed, as well as the LED lighting and optical drive bays.</p><p>
</p><p>Three
sizes available. Small, medium, and large. Large size cases hold HPTX, XL-ATX,
EATX, ATX, or M-ATX motherboards. Medium size cases hold ATX or M-ATX boards.
And the small size cases hold M-ATX boards. (<i>We currently don't offer a WTX size because they are primarily a server
board and our patents only cover personal computers.</i>)<br/></p><p></p>
<p>The minimum funding goal is set at
$12,500.00 to help get some cases out for product reviews. We have made a stretch goal of $3.75M
which is the equivalent of running out of the $2,500.00 contribution
level. As we
approach this level larger manufacturing facilities can be secured and large
production can proceed. To celebrate that accomplishment the Special Outlaw
immersion computer cases will be upgraded to a Limited Edition Founders Elysian
Immersion Computer Case. And as a bonus each case will have special silver or
gold plated badging and be Hand numbered.</p>
<p>If
that goal is not reached during crowdfunding, no one should feel let down. The special
Outlaw Immersion case is also a limited edition. This run of cases are to be
white with color changing LED lighting also hand signed and numbered. And will
only be offered during crowdfunding. The Outlaw Immersion case will be offered
later in our standard line with black exterior and a choice of blue, red, orange, or green non-lighted
trim colors.</p>

<p>The Elysian was designed to operate with less dielectric fluid, making
it easier on your wallet when using engineered dielectric fluids. A vapor
condenser integrated into the bulk head of the pressure vessel plus other space
saving innovations keeps the units smaller to save space. (<i>Depending on
customer feedback, the quick connects may be tucked inside with a removable
hatch in future models. Quick connects are used for connecting to external dual phase chillers for colder operating temps</i>.)
</p>
<p>Due to lack
of space and tooling we are unable to make the Elysian at this time without
having to farm it out, we would rather grow into a larger facility to
accommodate the required equipment and build here in the United States. </p>
<p>Hence our
secondary funding goal to raise funds for a larger facility. Going down this
route we will be able to keep strict quality controls over production providing
a better product overall.</p>
<br/><p><b>Risks:</b></p>
<p>The Outlaw Immersion case will be
our first batch run.</p>
<p>There are always risks associated
with manufacturing, from worker issues to supply delays and a host of other
problems. Our team has years of manufacturing experience to help overcome and
avoid potential problems. Their experience include but is not limited to:
Project Coordination; Quality Control; Product Engineering; Design Engineering;
Management; Logistics; and Sales. This diversity helps us identify potential
problems quickly and find efficient solutions.</p>

Crypt’N Computer Case Company is an
American manufacturing start up created to develop full immersion computer
cases. Established in 2011 by founder Arlo Christianson and self-funded, he
went to work designing and creating various models and prototypes. All along
coming closer and closer to a product truly revolutionary, one that you will be
using for years to come. Arlo has funded this endeavor up to this point. We
have reached a critical stage now that the utility patents have been prepared
and are now pending. We need capital to go into full production and we need to
build product recognition and awareness. That is where we need your help to
fund a few cases so we can get them out to be reviewed and to build product awareness.
Crypt'N is based in Great Falls Montana. One of our core tenants’ is bringing
manufacturing jobs back to America. 
In 2011, during a computer build,
Arlo wanted to submerge the whole computer. He set out to find an immersion
case for his build but was unable to find anything that would work. Needless to
say he was rather disappointed in the lack of available options and was
determined to do something about it. 
It was then the decision was made to
start the Crypt’N Computer Case Company for the purpose of bringing immersion
technology to personal computers. The budget has always been tight from the
start, however this would not deter him. He would spend all his extra time and money
over the last four years developing this product, to the point at which it’s
ready for the world. Our patents are now pending and we need your help to fund
the next stage.
Having an immersion case that was
multi fluid capable was one of the most important goals. We’ve had set backs
along the way. One example would be our Prototype 2.5 version. Quickly after
startup we realized there was a problem. The heat was being pulled out of the
case too fast, stress cracks where developing in the acrylic. The system still worked
great as Arlo over-engineered the material thickness of the pressure vessel for
safety. 


(This was awesome, we had an
idea this might be possible but the low boiling point fluid worked better than
we expected.)  

To find a solution we had to
redesign the case to fit our small annealing ovens. This was a good thing which
lead to a more user friendly case design and better quality. However one key
brake through came during testing  was pressurizing the containment area
and cooling system so that the system would work with almost all types of
dielectric fluid, not just the well-known mineral oil but also low boiling
point dielectric fluids. And by holding the increasing pressure in the system
made the low boiling point fluids work better yet. Immersion technology also
helps protect your computer from hazardous and harmful environments by fully
encapsulating your core computer components’. Our immersion cases use single
phase cooling with the option to use external dual phase chillers if lower
temps are needed.
Immersion technology
Immersion technology has been around
for a long time. First Arlo heard of it being used was in Seymour Cray's super
computers back in the 80's, but it has been around allot longer. It has been
adapted for use in sensitive data systems in large companies, government
entities, and the military. This technology allows those systems to be more
powerful, run faster, be smaller, and last longer. 
Immersion technology has a
significant advantage over air in heat transfer ability. Which allows for
denser configurations increasing the amount of electronics per cubic area that
an enclosure can maintain and operate safely. By increasing the cooling
capacity of your PC cases, we allow you to run your components harder, faster
and longer than an air cooled PC is possible of doing.
Another benefit from using our immersion
cases’ is that it seals the computer inside away from harmful environments such
as humidity, smoke and dust. Keeping your computer as clean as the day you put
it in the case.
Best of all you will not void the
warranties on your computer components like some high end water cooled set ups
will. And our immersion cases are multi-generational capable. Meaning you will
be able to change the internal components as you see fit. Now and into the
future. 
""Crypt'N relegates water cooling to the history books.""Now you can have this advanced
technology at work for you, in your home or office. Become Elite. Maximize your
computers potential with immersion cooling from Crypt’N. And as the public
embraces immersion technology in their homes and offices, motherboard and CPU
manufacturers will be able to take the restrictions off, on how dense the
electronics can be placed. Which should logically lead to a wider variety of
multiple CPU motherboards and in smaller form factors. Get ahead of this trend
and support us today. Donate to our crowd funding campaign to help us bring
about innovation.
Our immersion cases include: 

A lifetime warranty on materials and workmanship and a
     limited replacement warranty on ware parts such as fluid transfer pumps
     and LED's.
Thick impact resistant acrylic view window in the
     pressure vessel.
Black sleeved power and data cables. 
Multiple drive bays with case matching covers. 
Fluid transfer pump. 
High quality heat exchangers. 
Pre plumed and tested fluid transfer lines. 
Color changing LED fiber optic trim. (On selected
     models only.) 
A sealed pressure tank to safely hold and protect your
     computer components.  
Mounting hardware. 
Changeable rear I/O pass-through manifold.
Changeable drive bay power and data pass-through
     manifold.
Front side power switch.
Back side reset switch.
Removable dust filter. 
Stubbed out quick connects for expanding cooling
     capabilities.
Maintenance has been made easy.
Start by looking through your display window to verify fluid level. Wipe the
outside of case with a soft cloth and some case cleaner then vacuum the front
side dust filter or remove for easy cleaning. (Yea we said vacuum.) We have made the pump accessible, if
it ever needs to be changed, as well as the LED lighting and optical drive bays.
Three
sizes available. Small, medium, and large. Large size cases hold HPTX, XL-ATX,
EATX, ATX, or M-ATX motherboards. Medium size cases hold ATX or M-ATX boards.
And the small size cases hold M-ATX boards. (We currently don't offer a WTX size because they are primarily a server
board and our patents only cover personal computers.)
The minimum funding goal is set at
$12,500.00 to help get some cases out for product reviews. We have made a stretch goal of $3.75M
which is the equivalent of running out of the $2,500.00 contribution
level. As we
approach this level larger manufacturing facilities can be secured and large
production can proceed. To celebrate that accomplishment the Special Outlaw
immersion computer cases will be upgraded to a Limited Edition Founders Elysian
Immersion Computer Case. And as a bonus each case will have special silver or
gold plated badging and be Hand numbered.
If
that goal is not reached during crowdfunding, no one should feel let down. The special
Outlaw Immersion case is also a limited edition. This run of cases are to be
white with color changing LED lighting also hand signed and numbered. And will
only be offered during crowdfunding. The Outlaw Immersion case will be offered
later in our standard line with black exterior and a choice of blue, red, orange, or green non-lighted
trim colors.


Prototype 1 series
-Prototype 2.0 and earlier series
images unavailable due to Arlo’s earlier paranoia someone would steal his idea
if he allowed cameras in his work shop. We here at Crypt’N apologize for this
and have corrected his thinking. Here are some drawings from those earlier
designs, thank you.

Prototype 2.5 pics.-Notice above the CPU doesn't need
the heat sink installed for low boiling point dielectric fluids, however the
heat sink is required if using mineral oil like product or more heat dispersal area while overclocking but we didn't find it necessary while allowing the board to overclock every thing automatically using the overclock genie.-Frustrations below with early cable
management lead to a better motherboard tray lay out and exchangeable
pass-through manifolds.

The following are two design of Immersion cases that have been approved by Arlo for crowdfunding gifts/rewards.



Notice: Appearance may vary
slightly from images. (Small size Special Outlaw Immersion case shown above,
dimensions 14.25x29x14.25, med- 17.25x29x14.25, large- 18.25x36x14.25)  


The Elysian was designed to operate with less dielectric fluid, making
it easier on your wallet when using engineered dielectric fluids. A vapor
condenser integrated into the bulk head of the pressure vessel plus other space
saving innovations keeps the units smaller to save space. (Depending on
customer feedback, the quick connects may be tucked inside with a removable
hatch in future models. Quick connects are used for connecting to external dual phase chillers for colder operating temps.)

Due to lack
of space and tooling we are unable to make the Elysian at this time without
having to farm it out, we would rather grow into a larger facility to
accommodate the required equipment and build here in the United States. 
Hence our
secondary funding goal to raise funds for a larger facility. Going down this
route we will be able to keep strict quality controls over production providing
a better product overall.
Risks:
The Outlaw Immersion case will be
our first batch run.
There are always risks associated
with manufacturing, from worker issues to supply delays and a host of other
problems. Our team has years of manufacturing experience to help overcome and
avoid potential problems. Their experience include but is not limited to:
Project Coordination; Quality Control; Product Engineering; Design Engineering;
Management; Logistics; and Sales. This diversity helps us identify potential
problems quickly and find efficient solutions.

Eventually technology moves on and the older systems fall by the wayside, ending up in closets, junkyards and shredders. But some of it might not have to end up this way.
This campaign breathes new life into certain older high quality PDA power supplies by offering a way to reuse them with some modern devices that get their power charge from usb type A cables..
By reusing these older supplies, the gear once again makes a contribution to todays technology, the landfills have less to absorb and if you have one/some you don’t have to buy as many new AC chargers as you might have to otherwise.

<h3>The App</h3>
<h5>Introduction</h5>
<p>The next big thing in social media is here. Introducing HiLight, the app that's changing the way we interact with the people around us. Start by activating your very own ""HiLight"" to see your nearby friends. Want to check another location? Drag and drop additional HiLights onto the map and see who's there. When you're on the move, you can enable notifications that help you connect with friends near you when you otherwise would have missed them.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491092710/ye8px9ohjwpukhwq4esx.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h5>Inspiration</h5>
<p>Our original inspiration for this app was to create a platform that would notify the user when they were near their friends in public. This would solve the problem of missing your friends at big venues such as concerts, festivals, or parades because you were not aware of their presence. We often go to these events and don’t realize that other people we know were there until afterwards. Starting only from this small idea, our app has grown into much more than we originally intended.</p>

<p>Using Facebook integration, HiLight allows you to add friends who have the app, or invite those who don't. If you want to meet new people however, you can go public and see everyone else searching publicly. In your settings you are able to set age and gender restraints so you get a feed of those people who are around you. Once you click on their profile, you get their name, pictures, bio, and ability to message them. If you want to know if people are somewhere ahead of time, somewhere out of your current search radius (5 miles), you can place a HiLight in that location and it allows you to view who's there. For example, you're going on vacation and want to see if anyone you know is there or just see what types of people are there. That's the initial app we're releasing but we have a lot of cool features, improvements, and optimization that will be going into updates in the months following our release. </p>

Our Team
We are freshmen at Babson College with an idea and the determination to pursue it.

Will Battel is from Edina, Minnesota. His passions include technology, entrepreneurship, and stock trading. Will is responsible for guiding the app through development and preparing the business for operations in April.
Ben Ventura is from Newburyport, Massachusetts. He loves sports, business, and is now experimenting with photography. In addition to accounting, Ben is tasked with ensuring our users are satisfied with the app.
Youcef Ziad was born in Algeria and grew up in Holbrook, Massachusetts. He also loves sports as well as art and Mexican food. Youcef is in charge of marketing and is working tirelessly to ensure a successful launch.


The App
Introduction
The next big thing in social media is here. Introducing HiLight, the app that's changing the way we interact with the people around us. Start by activating your very own ""HiLight"" to see your nearby friends. Want to check another location? Drag and drop additional HiLights onto the map and see who's there. When you're on the move, you can enable notifications that help you connect with friends near you when you otherwise would have missed them.

Inspiration
Our original inspiration for this app was to create a platform that would notify the user when they were near their friends in public. This would solve the problem of missing your friends at big venues such as concerts, festivals, or parades because you were not aware of their presence. We often go to these events and don’t realize that other people we know were there until afterwards. Starting only from this small idea, our app has grown into much more than we originally intended.

What We Need & What You Get
The Costs
Building and launching an app is expensive! See what we're paying for below.

<p>FYNPICK is an online market place for products, services and properties.  Think of it as a global medium for sellers and buyers to meet and have a great online buying experience from customer-to-customer (C2C), customer-to-business (C2B) and business-to-business (B2B).<br/><br/>


We started building FYNPICK for a simple reason. We want to secure online transactions and make customers’ experience as great as possible<br/><br/>


We always put in mind the benefit that would come in building this project. We have realized that building FYNPICK will not just create a good buying experience. It can also improve our economic status by empowering Filipinos to offer great freelance services and unique products online internationally.

<p><b>On  day  two  of  a five  day  hunt with friends,</b>  I  went  to  my tree  stand  early  to fix  a problem I was having with my tree stand roof. I tried to fix the thin, leaking fabric that was supposed to be keeping me dry. No matter what I did, the roof would tilt badly with the slightest wind. This battle continued for the rest of the day until I cut it from the tree and let it fall to the ground. Instead of enjoying my time outside I was distracted, wet and cold. </p>
<p><b>After that day, I vowed that I would find a tree stand roof that would keep me dry or I would build one. </b></p>
<p>That’s when the idea that would become the <b><a href=""http://bit.ly/CreatedByHuntersForHunters%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Buck N Cover</a></b> was born. After five years of research, developing, testing and securing a patent; the Buck N Cover is ready to be shared with hunters, outdoorsmen and outdoorswomen everywhere. We just need your help and support to get our first mass production order filled.   </p>

<h2>What is The Buck N Cover?</h2>
<p>Imagine sitting in your tree stand under a light weight, structurally strong, long lasting tree stand roof that locks onto the tree and can be left in the woods for many seasons. Now imagine your bow and gear are hanging exactly where you want them as you remain dry on those wet winter days. You my friend, are sitting under a Buck N Cover.<br/></p>

<p>The Buck N Cover is a patented solid tree

<p><b>Is the Buck N Cover tree stand roof for permanent or temporary use?</b></p>
<p>The Buck N Cover is meant to be a permanent solution for your tree
stand, but can be removed with ease if so needed. We recommend putting the Buck
N Cover over your favorite tree stands and leaving them all season long.</p>
<p><b>What kinds of maintenance does the Buck N Cover require?</b></p>
<p>The Buck N Cover needs very little maintenance. We recommend removing
the “roof assembly” at the end of the season to reduce debris build-up on top
of the roof. We also recommend checking the ratchet strap for wear and
tightening any loose nuts and bolts.</p>
<p><b>Is the Buck N Cover compatible with all tree stands?  </b></p>
<p>Yes, the Buck N Cover attaches to the tree above your single, double,
chain-on or climber tree stand.</p>
<p><b>Can I buy more hooks for my Buck N Cover? </b></p>
<p>Yes, we sell packages of hooks. <span>Contact us to learn more about how to place an order for additional
hooks.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What tools are needed to assemble and disassemble? </b></p>
<p>The only tools needed to assemble and disassemble the Buck N Cover are a
pair of ½” wrenches. Watch our Buck N Cover instructional and tips videos for
help.</p>
<p><b>How long does it take to assemble the Buck N Cover?</b></p>
<p>Assembly of the Buck N Cover at ground level takes 15 to 20 minutes. It
takes about 10 minutes to raise and attach the Buck N Cover to the tree.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What material is the roof and frame made out of?</b></p>
<p>The Buck N Cover roof is made of waterproof 18 ounce polyvinyl material
that resists sun and weather degradation. The frame is made of light
weight powder coated aluminum so it will not rust.</p>
<p><b>How much weight can the Buck N Cover hold?</b></p>
<p>We recommend less than ten pounds of total weight on the “roof assembly”
and less than 10 pounds on the “tree bracket” equipment hooks.</p>
<p><b>How long will my Buck N Cover last? </b></p>
<p>The Buck N Cover frame does not rust and the polyvinyl material resists
rot, wear and tear. We have left a Buck N Cover in the woods for over 2 years straight
and it still looks and performs like new.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Is the Buck N Cover safe for children and teenagers to use?</b></p>
<p>The Buck N Cover is safe for children and teenagers to sit under as long
as they are wearing a safety harness, following the tree stand manufacturer’s
safety instructions and have adult supervision. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>When will my order be shipped?</b></p>
<p>We will begin manufacturing as soon as <span>our
Indiegogo campaign has finished. Since we produce the Buck N Cover in the
United States, we should start shipping shortly after that. We will send email updates on
the progress of your order.</span></p>

I tried to fix the thin, leaking fabric that was supposed to be keeping me dry. No matter what I did, the roof would tilt badly with the slightest wind. This battle continued for the rest of the day until I cut it from the tree and let it fall to the ground. Instead of enjoying my time outside I was distracted, wet and cold. 
After that day, I vowed that I would find a tree stand roof that would keep me dry or I would build one. 
That’s when the idea that would become the Buck N Cover was born. After five years of research, developing, testing and securing a patent; the Buck N Cover is ready to be shared with hunters, outdoorsmen and outdoorswomen everywhere. We just need your help and support to get our first mass production order filled.   






What is The Buck N Cover?
Imagine sitting in your tree stand under a light weight, structurally strong, long lasting tree stand roof that locks onto the tree and can be left in the woods for many seasons. Now imagine your bow and gear are hanging exactly where you want them as you remain dry on those wet winter days. You my friend, are sitting under a Buck N Cover.

Universal Tree Stand Roof Design
The Buck N Cover is a patented solid tree
stand roof made to fit over single and double ladder-stands, climbers and
chain-on stands. Throw away your umbrellas and flimsy protection covers and
invest in a solid structure that will help protect you from Mother Nature for
years to come. ­




American Structure, Quality Built
We designed the Buck N Cover with the highest respect for quality, durability and longevity. The approximately 4’ x 4’ powder coated aluminum frame will not rust and is engineered to be a permanent addition to your tree stand. With the durable camouflage poly-vinyl roof, the Buck N Cover can hang over your stand for this hunting season and seasons to come.


Perfect Limb Technology for Hands-Free Hunting
Designed by hunters for hunters,
enjoy the freedom the Buck N Cover brings by giving you custom options for
hands-free hunting. We created perfect limb technology right on the roof that
gives you the choice of 30 separate and adjustable hanging locations for hooks that can twist 360 degrees.
Now you can hang your gear and stay out of the rain with just one product.


Easy,
Swift and Safe Assembly
Built with safety as a priority, the Buck N Cover was designed at an
impressively low weight of 13lbs. In just 20 minutes, assemble the Buck N
Cover at ground-level; then raise and fasten the tree bracket to the tree;
bring up the roof and maneuver it over your head with one-hand, leaving your

<p><b style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>3D printing works by creating one layer at a time. Printing speed depends on how fast a printer can print each layer. Something that's very important. UV DLP printing is able to print an entire layer at a time versus Laser printers that must focus their beams on a single point in a layer and move from there. Imagine writing the alphabet. UV DLP printing would print the entire alphabet at once, like a stamp. A laser printer would need to draw out each letter one at a time (like handwriting). </b><br/></p>

<p><b>Existing DLP printers must be controlled through the connection of a PC. This is because although the printer has a PCB to control the DLP, they must rely on graphics processing from the connected PC.

</div></div>","3D printing has boomed in the past few years. Every variety of printer from cheap desktop models to prohibitively expensive industrial-grade models have saturated the market. While choice for the consumer is good, sometimes it can be confusing to find just exactly what you require for personal use. So, we went out and made it for you. 


3D printing works by creating one layer at a time. Printing speed depends on how fast a printer can print each layer. Something that's very important. UV DLP printing is able to print an entire layer at a time versus Laser printers that must focus their beams on a single point in a layer and move from there. Imagine writing the alphabet. UV DLP printing would print the entire alphabet at once, like a stamp. A laser printer would need to draw out each letter one at a time (like handwriting). 




UV DLP 3D printing speeds work regardless of object size or count whereas Laser printing is greatly affected by object size and count. As the size or count increases, Laser 3D printing times will increase exponentially. 





While 3D printers are ""trending towards the mainstream"" we still haven't found one that quite fits the needs of individual users, hobbyists, free-lance professionals or small businesses. One that is affordable, compact and sacrifices little, if nothing, in terms of printing resolution.Because a normal DLP engine shoots its beam in a wide spectrum the range causes large variability in light intensity throughout the beam. The light towards the center shines the brightest and most intensely while the light at the edges are comparatively very weak. Such uneven light produces unevenness in the resulting print out, causing variance with the modeling data you inputted.The 100% UV engine equipped on the G Printer is focused so that it provides a much more uniform beam in terms of light intensity. This allows for greater precision in printing particularly when it comes to smooth surfaces and straight lines.The G Printer Design Functionality in a compact Design. The G Printer was designed to fit in any sort of working space. Whether you're working for home or the office, we guarantee G Printer can operate without being a burden. However, for this small size, G Printer has an extraordinary printing capacity being capable of printable sizes of 5.1x 3.1x 5.5 (inches).

Existing DLP printers must be controlled through the connection of a PC. This is because although the printer has a PCB to control the DLP, they must rely on graphics processing from the connected PC. This means that printing is heavily dependant on the connected PC and will determine success or failure. 
Disadvantages of non-embedded systems:



Printing stops if the connection between your PC and printer is disconnected. 



Printing stops if your PC freezes or the power fails.



Printing will be affected depending on what other programs are being run simultaneously on your PC that take up a lot of system resources.




G Printer works without the need for a connected PC or network. The embedded support system manages the graphics video signal and DLP engine directly. This guarantees stability when printing. 


G Printer is the first UV DLP 3D printer that eliminates the need for a PC or wifi network for those long printing hours. Our embedded system allows simple plug and play from a standard USB drive and the system will read the files on your drive and print directly. You don't need to worry about the power on your computer going out or your network having lag issues. 


Working with ""Materialise"", we also developed our own proprietary G Printer Studio that comes with Materialise software embedded. We also pre-installed automatic support software. There is no need for you to worry about properly placing supports to maintain the structure of your work. Materialise produces the best performance software for 3D printing solutions. G Printer and Materialise have partnered together to deliver the best 3D printing solution out there. Success or failure of a complete print is dependent on having the right supports added to your design when utilizing SLA and/or SLA-DLP. 





Through our G Printer Studio, you will be provided strong automated structure features so your design will come out with the right supports it needs to come out as a sturdy object. G Printer Studio supports various file types such as STL, OBJ, PLY, 3DS, etc. Easy operation provides quick and automated support for data slicing. 




With our software, supports will be placed in the most efficient locations so that you don't waste a drop of resin. Simply use the built-in support function.

<div>
<p></p>
<p>Bask is one of the worlds first autonomous mobile chargers. It uses a mixture of light and VpGB (vibrations and movements) to continually charge itself on-the-go. </p>
<p>We have designed Bask to be portable, sleek and reliable. It can fully charge in as little as one hour and will provide you with up to 60 minutes of talk time or 120 minutes of stand-by time.</p>
<p>We will start off by offering Bask or the iPhone 5/5S, iPhone 6/6S and 6 Plus/6S Plus. We will expand to iPad Mini/Air and other mobile devices.</p>

<div>Within Bask are two batteries. The first is a VpGB (vibration powered generating battery) which creates and stores power from your daily movements. The second is a rechargeable battery which is powered by the solar cells located on the front and back of Bask.  </div>
<div>Bask has been tested with an output of 2.5 amps.<br/>
</div> <p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>What phones is Bask compatible with?</h3> <p></p>

<h3>What are your challenges moving forward? </h3>
<p>We've managed to develop and create a prototype, and we're ready to share it with the world. However we do face a few challenges moving forward, the first of which is covering the cost to manufacture the first 2,500 units. </p>
<p>The second challenge we're facing is product awareness. We hope by launching our campaign we can reach our minimum funding goals and help bring product awareness to Bask with the built in customer base IndieGogo provides.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Funding Goals?</h3>
<p>Bask has unlimited potential and with your help, we can expand to additional mobile devices and tablets. </p>
<p>Our minimum funding goal of $25,000.00 will allow us to offer Bask for the iPhone iPhone 5/5S and iPhone 6/6 Plus. Our stretch campaign goals would allow us to offer Bask for the iPad Air and iPad Mini as well as Samsung devices.</p>
<ul>
<li>At $75,000.00 we can offer additional colors and finishes.</li>
<li>At $125,000.00 we can expand to the iPad Mini.</li>

Rather than shake it, you can just carry it in your pocket or purse, your daily walking and movements will help charge the battery. (2) the second way to charge Bask is to lay it in the sunlight, either in a window or dash of a car, within one hour, it will be fully charged.</p>
<p><b>How much of a charge will Bask give my phone?</b></p>
<p>This varies from each individual user's daily use. In product testing, Bask provided an additional 60 minutes of talk time or 120 minutes of standby use. Since Bask is constantly recharging, the charge obtained may provide more than the estimated 60 minutes.</p>
<p><b>What is the amps output?</b></p>
<p>We have tested Bask at 2.5 amps.</p>

</div>
</div></div>","What is Bask?


Bask is one of the worlds first autonomous mobile chargers. It uses a mixture of light and VpGB (vibrations and movements) to continually charge itself on-the-go. 
We have designed Bask to be portable, sleek and reliable. It can fully charge in as little as one hour and will provide you with up to 60 minutes of talk time or 120 minutes of stand-by time.
We will start off by offering Bask or the iPhone 5/5S, iPhone 6/6S and 6 Plus/6S Plus. We will expand to iPad Mini/Air and other mobile devices.

   How does it work?
Within Bask are two batteries. The first is a VpGB (vibration powered generating battery) which creates and stores power from your daily movements. The second is a rechargeable battery which is powered by the solar cells located on the front and back of Bask.  
Bask has been tested with an output of 2.5 amps.
 
    What phones is Bask compatible with? 
Bask has unlimited potential and can be designed to accompany any number of devices. Currently Bask is only compatible with:

iPhone 5
iPhone 5S
iPhone 6
iPhone 6S
iPhone 6 Plus
iPhone 6S Plus

If we reach our stretch funding goals, we can also bring Bask to iPad as well as other devices. 
    What will the funds be used for? 
The funds raised from this campaign will be used for the following:

Legal Costs (Attorney Fees, Corporate Filings, Etc.)
Trademark and additional patents
Manufacturing a minimum of 2,500 Bask units
Marketing materials and advertising 
Company Overhead (Office Space, Equipment, Supplies, Insurance, Etc)
Shipping Materials
Postage Cost
Business and financial consultants regarding Series A funding.

    How does Bask attach to my phone? 
We designed Bask to fit securely. Once on the phone, Bask snaps into place and there's no risk of it detaching during use.



What are your challenges moving forward? 
We've managed to develop and create a prototype, and we're ready to share it with the world. However we do face a few challenges moving forward, the first of which is covering the cost to manufacture the first 2,500 units. 
The second challenge we're facing is product awareness. We hope by launching our campaign we can reach our minimum funding goals and help bring product awareness to Bask with the built in customer base IndieGogo provides.

Funding Goals?
Bask has unlimited potential and with your help, we can expand to additional mobile devices and tablets. 
Our minimum funding goal of $25,000.00 will allow us to offer Bask for the iPhone iPhone 5/5S and iPhone 6/6 Plus. Our stretch campaign goals would allow us to offer Bask for the iPad Air and iPad Mini as well as Samsung devices.

At $75,000.00 we can offer additional colors and finishes.
At $125,000.00 we can expand to the iPad Mini.
At $200,000.00 we can expand to the iPad Air 2.
At $250,000.00 we can expand to include Samsung devices.



Evolution of Bask? 
Bask took months to develop and perfect. Here are the first early renderings of what led to Bask.



Our first 3D printed prototype

Our first working prototype on an iPhone 5S




What does your Warranty mean?
We believe in Bask and the quality of our product so much we are willing to back it by a two year warranty. If your device ever stops working or breaks in the first two years, we'll replace it, no questions asked. 

Color Options?
Currently we only offer black however we are working hard to bring a wide variety of colors and finishes to the product line. We've developed a line of premium finishes to allow users to make a statement.
Black (Standard)



Gold (Near future)




We will also be launching a wide variety of colors to better fit your individual style.

Anyone can sell for free with our easy to navigate design and take over 75% profit from each sale, thats more profit from selling on Apple's App Store or Google's Play Store. We have designed the website and are in final stages of designing the companion mobile app. Apid is something different because never before has there been a site where you can safely purchase mobile apps and PC or Mac software in the same place.

<h3><b>What Makes Apid 'Safe'?</b></h3>
<div>Everything sold on Apid is tried, tested and approved before being published onto the site. We understand that this means that applications are not immediately available for download but it does allow it to be as safe as possible. </div>
<h3>How Apid Came To Be</h3>
<div>As app developers we're always looking for more ways to get our apps to the people, and we noticed that not every android device we bought had google play on it. And whilst looking for even more software to make our apps better we couldn't find a site with the software we wanted that didn't look like we were going to download a virus. So from there we came up with the idea of a safe, cheap option for all developers that'll work with all android devices.</div> </div> <div> <h3>We Need Just £500 from you!</h3> <p>What? Just £500, why so little?</p>
<p>Well we only need your support and for you all to show your interest in our idea. We only need enough money to launch our beta. The website will be in controlled beta testing with the money raised; it'll help improve security, improve app connectivity and test high traffic situations. From showing your interest and support, after beta sponsors and investors are willing to pay the rest. However for that to happen we need you to show your interest and  support.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Your contribution and support could change the whole internet for the better. Our project not only makes purchasing apps for your mobile or software for you computer easy and safe it will persuade other websites to improve safety features too.

<p style=""text-align: right;"">Phuoc Phan </p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">Founder and CEO﻿</p>
<h3><strong>How &amp; Why YuniDetect Started</strong></h3>
<p>Our current beta-tester(To protect the identity of the beta-tester and health care facility that the beta-tester attends, this information can not be disclosed) is currently participating in the Orthopedic Therapy Program at the Health Care Facility in Worcester, MA.  This facility has been caring for people who have the ability to thrive when given the support needed. Their mission is to serve others which has been the cornerstone of the foundation. They are the go-to service for families that support their loved ones with a disability. The Assistive Technology Program is one of their most important initiatives to support families and their loved ones. </p>
<p>Our Beta-tester has good use of the left arm, meaning the beta-tester has good functionality from the shoulder to the fingers.  The beta-tester also has good strength in both the left arm and leg.  The beta-user right appendages are not nearly as strong and not functional in comparison to the left side.  The beta-user left hand has the fine motor skills needed to operate the electric wheelchair joystick and press buttons, while the right hand can not even hold objects steady for the left hand to use.  Even though the beta-tester has good strength and coordination in the left appendages, the beta-user has slow reaction times with them.</p>
<p>The beta-tester is able to follow very basic directions.  The beta-tester can understand and answer yes/no questions and understand who/what/where/when/why questions.  The beta-user is also able to pick a solution from 2-3 options that are given.  The beta-user attention span to tasks only lasts for about 30 minutes and needs to be supervised while operating the electric wheelchair.</p>
<p>Therefore, Yuni Design was able to design and create a wheelchair add-on system, which gives the user the independence to drive the powered wheelchair with a reduction of crashes. Anyone who is wheelchair bound could utilize this system in order to reduce collisions with other people or objects in their path.  This system will warn, stop, or automatically turn the user away from an object/person in order to reduce collisions that could potentially harm the user.</p>
<h3>Importance of Spreading the Word</h3>
<p>After our experience in making our add-on system for our beta-tester, it has taught us that there are a lot of people in this world that are in need of technology helping them to live a better life. While working with the beta-tester, we saw that the technology that the beta-tester was using, was doing its job, but fell short in providing independence,saftey and happiness for the user and the caregiver. I was able to see the beta-tester smile again and in a sense gain some independence and saftey back with the technology we created. After seeing what we created was successful we wanted to share this opportunity with others, like our beta-tester.   </p>
<h3>What is YuniDetect</h3>
<p>YuniDetect is an external add-on wheelchair system that is portable due to its small size and ability to be used across multiple wheelchairs or electrical transportation devices with minor changes. While the potential competition has the product built into the wheelchair or electrical transportation device, our product allows the user to transfer the invention to other powered wheelchairs or other electrical transportation devices in which results a lower price cost than our competitors. Further, it gives the user true ability to experience a user friendly system due to its variety of operational modes that suits the user’s needs. Currently it has been tested on the Quickie QM-7 Series wheelchair. </p>
<h3>How does YuniDetect Work</h3>
<p>Our system is designed so that the sensors are mounted to provide an almost 360 degree perimeter zone of protection around the chair. Our system is designed to reduce the number of collisions while operating the wheelchair. The system stops the wheelchair user from colliding into walls or objects, as long as the override mode is not enabled. There are 5 different modes this system can be operated with.  The first mode to describe is the override mode.  This mode disables the sensor conditions and allows normal operation of the wheelchair.  This mode acts like our system isn’t even a part of the wheelchair.  The next two modes are the distance requirements.  The two distances are short and long.  This is how far the wheelchair will stop from an object or wall to ensure the reduced collision and safety of the wheelchair user.  The final two modes are auto-assist enabled and disabled.  If auto-assist is DISABLED, then the system will stop the wheelchair at the short or long mode that is selected.  The auto-assist ENABLED mode will stop the wheelchair at the short or long mode selected and will also pulse the wheelchair in the opposite direction of the tripped sensor.  The sensors are grouped in the software as front and back.  This means if the front right sensor gets tripped, it will pulse the wheelchair backwards.  If the back right sensors get tripped, the wheelchair will pulse forward. </p>

Currently it has been tested on the Quickie QM-7 Series wheelchair. 
How does YuniDetect Work
Our system is designed so that the sensors are mounted to provide an almost 360 degree perimeter zone of protection around the chair. Our system is designed to reduce the number of collisions while operating the wheelchair. The system stops the wheelchair user from colliding into walls or objects, as long as the override mode is not enabled. There are 5 different modes this system can be operated with.  The first mode to describe is the override mode.  This mode disables the sensor conditions and allows normal operation of the wheelchair.  This mode acts like our system isn’t even a part of the wheelchair.  The next two modes are the distance requirements.  The two distances are short and long.  This is how far the wheelchair will stop from an object or wall to ensure the reduced collision and safety of the wheelchair user.  The final two modes are auto-assist enabled and disabled.  If auto-assist is DISABLED, then the system will stop the wheelchair at the short or long mode that is selected.  The auto-assist ENABLED mode will stop the wheelchair at the short or long mode selected and will also pulse the wheelchair in the opposite direction of the tripped sensor.  The sensors are grouped in the software as front and back.  This means if the front right sensor gets tripped, it will pulse the wheelchair backwards.  If the back right sensors get tripped, the wheelchair will pulse forward. 
 
                                                
The system we are currently displaying is our prototype and is the one our current beta-tester is using today. We plan to have the transparent cover and a touch interface. We have made our final prototype device even smaller with a more discrete look, and hopefully with your donation we can make it into reality.

Indiegogo Timeline
                           
Perks for our Indiegogo Contributors
                            
The last two perks, may be purchased for someone you know or you can donate it to a healthcare facility, examples such as Seven Hills Foundation, etc. (currently works for Quickie wheelchairs only.)
Even though we strive to reach our goal and beyond, we have a back up plan. If we do not reach our goal we will use the money to refine our R&D efforts and present this to a wheelchair manufacturing company. Any perks chosen for the product donation, we will work with 3D printing companies to still deliver the system to the selected facility by the contributor or to the contributor.

Risks & Challenges
We are really excited about launching the company’s first product. However, we know that the most important part of our process is that we fulfill our promise to you, our backers, and deliver the product on time!
Though we have some preliminary agreements with manufactures, we want to inform you of any potential issues along the way. Now since we have a working prototype, we will face new challenges related to production, packaging and shipping. At Yuni Design, LLC we will ensure the best quality product. We will continue to work hard, and of course, keep you informed every step of the way!
Thank You,
Yuni Design Team
 
Note: Please Note that shipping to any country outside North America and Canada may be delayed or cancelled depending on the feasibility of local product approval requirements or local import regulations. In a case of cancellation we will refund your pledge. There are many additional duties, fees or taxes raised by the authorities in your country. You may need to take care of them yourself when receiving the shipment.

<h2>Story</h2>
<p>My name is Miikka Salomaa and I'm a software engineer from Finland. I use a laptop stand to get my laptop's display to the same height as my external display. I previously used a metal laptop stand but they aren't ecological, are bulky and don't easily fit in your laptop case.</p>
<p>My colleague had designed a light-weight alternative that you could easily take with you wherever you went. I wanted to make it more durable and beautiful which is why I chose to use Finnish quality plywood as the material. Thus, Wunderstand was born. </p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Yes it is Magic, a hundred years ago this technology was witnessed by Nikola Tesla and ever since then many scientists have further developed this technology. A decade ago in 2006 students from MIT developed a mechanism of transmitting power of up to 60 watts at a distance of 2 meters without any conductors through mid-air. </p>
<p>While this beautiful technology is yet to unravel in the main stream and no such product has been commercialized to serve consumers. a breakthrough that portends the literal and figurative untethering of our electronic age. Until this development, after all the phrase ""mobile electronics""has been a lie. How portable is your laptop if it has to feed every few hours, like an embryo through a cord? How mobile is your phone if it shuts down after too long away from a plug? the world is about to be cured of its attachment disorder.  </p>

Please do not make any donations to this campaign as this project is on hold for now due to some delay in our PATENT registration. We are trying our best to overcome this issue and relaunch this campaign at a later date. Thanks for taking interest in our product and supporting us. Any suggestions are most welcome. 
                                        ****IMPORTANT NOTICE****
A WIRELESS SOLUTION TO ALL YOUR CHARGING NEEDS

Imagine leaving your mobile phone in your pocket or anywhere in an average sized room and being able to charge it even while using your phone!
Yes it is Magic, a hundred years ago this technology was witnessed by Nikola Tesla and ever since then many scientists have further developed this technology. A decade ago in 2006 students from MIT developed a mechanism of transmitting power of up to 60 watts at a distance of 2 meters without any conductors through mid-air. 
While this beautiful technology is yet to unravel in the main stream and no such product has been commercialized to serve consumers. a breakthrough that portends the literal and figurative untethering of our electronic age. Until this development, after all the phrase ""mobile electronics""has been a lie. How portable is your laptop if it has to feed every few hours, like an embryo through a cord? How mobile is your phone if it shuts down after too long away from a plug? the world is about to be cured of its attachment disorder.  


WHAT IS MAGNETO CHARGE?

Imagine a wireless charger which can make your life much easier compared to any other charger in the market. Magneto Charge by Karbon® incorporates a form of contact-less electrical transmission technology based on magnetic resonance. Electromagnetic energy  is only transferred to recipient devices that share the identical resonant frequency as the energy source, so energy transfer efficiency is maintained even when misalignment occurs unlike Qi technology. Furthermore, even if there are metal objects located between the transmitter and receiver, no heat induction occurs.  
 


TECHNICAL DETAILS


This one time investment would mean no more wires dangling around in the room, the whole family can use a single unit with the device capable of connecting with 4 receivers. The efficiency of power transfer is + 50% and each connected device receives a minimum of 1 amp of current and it can adjust with various devices if more amperage is required up to 5 amps . This version of magneto charge will only operate at 5 V output which is suitable for mobile phones, gaming controllers and tablets. The receiver modules will be embedded into sleek phone cases allowing the user to leave the phone in their protective case while charging and eliminating the need of ever plugging into a socket, the rise in temperature while charging will be around 15 Celsius or 59 Fahrenheit . The components used within the charger and receiver will meet EMC & ICNIRP guidelines.   

           



 UNTETHERING AT A GREATER COST?

The key features and potential benefits of magneto charge go beyond one's imagination, let's enlighten you:

 The most convenient charger ever made which cuts the cords and provides ultimate freedom to the user.
Being a universal device there is no worry about compatibility issues, be it your iPhone, Nexus, iPad or Galaxy 
 Besides convenience and style this charger will save you tons of money by eliminating the need of ever buying batteries for your gaming controllers, T.V. remote control and wall clock etc.
The wireless charger is specifically designed to save any hassle of internal alterations to your mobile device while preventing void warranties. 
One for All, this one charger will charge up to 4 devices simultaneously freeing up most of the sockets in a room. 








The costs associated with the components and production makes up a huge 66% of the total budget and it would be cost effective for the production if we buy all components in bulk as we have negotiated prices on certain volume with our sub contractors and suppliers in China. 
We are hoping for a great response from the indiegogo community but if there is a lack of funding we will have to reconsider if production can break even with the costs and although we would still fulfill all the perks/orders but it might require some extra time. In which case we will inform all the backers and supporters of this project if there is any amendment in the plan. 


PROJECT TIME LINE 

We have worked extremely hard to design our prototype, and visited China several times to find the components which we require, our suppliers hold several patents for this technology both in China and internationally. All aspects prior to manufacturing this device have been thoroughly looked into. If we raise more than our goal we would try to accelerate production so that we may be able to deliver all the perks slightly earlier.

The
     Blue Lion Elite Lacrosse Club is a growing organization that was founded in
     2008 to provide local youth and high school lacrosse players an opportunity to compete year-round on a
     regional and national level.
This past summer three of our teams qualified for the Dicks
     Sporting Goods National Lacrosse Championship.  Only the best lacrosse teams in the
     country qualify for this tournament via top finishes in select summer
     tournaments.  If we raise enough
     funding, we have the opportunity to send the 1st ever high
     school level teams from Kansas City as well as the 2nd ever
     youth team.  Sending three teams to
     Florida over New Years is very expensive, and we need your help to get us
     there.  
Your donations will provide these players with a once in a lifetime
     experience, and may be what allows a Kansas City lacrosse player to be recruited
     to play college lacrosse.

OMNIPOLE AND WHY WE DESIGN IT</b></p>There are several unique pole-mounted GoPro accessories on the market
today, but none quite like this. Admittedly they serve their purposes fairly
well, but if you want the versatility and features of Omnipole, you may spend
$300 or more to buy several items needed to get the same results. This is why
we designed Omnipole, <b>the
most versatile pole-mount system </b>to
hit the market for GoPro cameras. This single item meets all the needs for
today’s GoPro Photographers and Videographers. We put tremendous effort into
every detail of Omnipole, and selected top-notch materials for exceptional
toughness and durability. Omnipole is designed to be used as both an extension
pole for sports and other activities, as well a tripod for steady shots. With
optional accessories, you can mount two cameras on one Omnipole to record first
person POV footage and selfie simultaneously. You can also mount your
smartphone on it as the GoPro live preview window, GoPro remote and even an
action camera! With Omnipole, the possibilities are endless.<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441298722/frzlpbquri4we8ts9s94.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b></b></p><p><b><b>TOUGH,

In that spirit we offer you our story. Judge as you see fit. We are running this campaign to try to add momentum to our startup and to gauge markets.<br/><br/>Zeni Kinetic manufactures and sells dynamic, versatile 3D Printers and high-quality plastic filament. Zeni also operates a retail storefront in the heart of Salt Lake City, providing customers a hands-on introduction to 3D Printing and a local destination for supplies, repairs, maintenance and consulting. In addition, we provide 3D Printing services, as well as 3D Scanning for all our customer's project needs.<br/><br/></span></div>

<br/>Zeni Kinetic LLC was established in September 2013, initially producing and selling premium-quality filament online. Filament sales were steady and growing throughout most of 2014, despite overseas companies flooding the market causing filament prices to drop. During this phase Zeni was improving their printer designs and experimenting with effective large-format configurations. In October 2014, Zeni opened its retail location in a key commerce location in Salt Lake City, UT. Concurrent with opening its retail store, Zeni began production on its new Zeni Origin 3D Printer. The Origin 3D Printer rapidly gained traction with Zeni's preexisting customer base and spread through word of mouth as well.<br/><br/></span></div>

We were faced with an important decision; whether to continue producing printers with inherent flaws or to put production on hold to correct this before any further printers were produced. With a commitment to quality and reliability we weighed other hot ends available against making our own and made the decision to work with a local CNC shop to design and produce a custom hot-end. This hot-end has made our printer significantly more reliable, MUCH easier to true the nozzles to each other and much faster and easier to clear any hot-end clogs. However, with a modest, yet growing backlog of printer orders we were forced to halt sales to avoid becoming overwhelmed. The redesign of the hot-end took longer than anticipated and with production on hold, most of our production staff sought out new jobs. By the time the hot-end was completed in late May 2015, we were left with a fraction of our production staff and found ourselves in a near stall situation.</span>

<p><br/></p>
<p>The hot end we came up with is compact, solid and almost fool-proof. The teflon liner can be swapped to stainless allowing temps up to almost 400°C and they are clamped in with a collar clamp instead of a groove mount. This allows very easy adjustments to the height. Clogs are easy to clear and the nozzle can be changed in under a minute.<br/></p>

We are running this campaign to try to add momentum to our startup and to gauge markets.Zeni Kinetic manufactures and sells dynamic, versatile 3D Printers and high-quality plastic filament. Zeni also operates a retail storefront in the heart of Salt Lake City, providing customers a hands-on introduction to 3D Printing and a local destination for supplies, repairs, maintenance and consulting. In addition, we provide 3D Printing services, as well as 3D Scanning for all our customer's project needs.

Zeni Kinetic LLC was established in September 2013, initially producing and selling premium-quality filament online. Filament sales were steady and growing throughout most of 2014, despite overseas companies flooding the market causing filament prices to drop. During this phase Zeni was improving their printer designs and experimenting with effective large-format configurations. In October 2014, Zeni opened its retail location in a key commerce location in Salt Lake City, UT. Concurrent with opening its retail store, Zeni began production on its new Zeni Origin 3D Printer. The Origin 3D Printer rapidly gained traction with Zeni's preexisting customer base and spread through word of mouth as well.


Toward the end of April 2015, a critical flaw surfaced in the design and functionality of the extruder hot-ends that were being used in our printers. We were faced with an important decision; whether to continue producing printers with inherent flaws or to put production on hold to correct this before any further printers were produced. With a commitment to quality and reliability we weighed other hot ends available against making our own and made the decision to work with a local CNC shop to design and produce a custom hot-end. This hot-end has made our printer significantly more reliable, MUCH easier to true the nozzles to each other and much faster and easier to clear any hot-end clogs. However, with a modest, yet growing backlog of printer orders we were forced to halt sales to avoid becoming overwhelmed. The redesign of the hot-end took longer than anticipated and with production on hold, most of our production staff sought out new jobs. By the time the hot-end was completed in late May 2015, we were left with a fraction of our production staff and found ourselves in a near stall situation.





The hot end we came up with is compact, solid and almost fool-proof. The teflon liner can be swapped to stainless allowing temps up to almost 400°C and they are clamped in with a collar clamp instead of a groove mount. This allows very easy adjustments to the height. Clogs are easy to clear and the nozzle can be changed in under a minute.


When we stopped production we redirected our efforts towards reconfiguring our production process and developing a comprehensive business plan in an effort to acquire funding while also taking the opportunity to re-invent our company from the ground up. We are currently running on a very constricted budget and production is being ushered along by a small group of dedicated people who believe in our company and want to see it grow.



We view our growing pains as a strong learning experiences and we are making every effort possible to adapt and grow in order to deliver on the promises we've made to our customers. We are confident that our printer is now virtually flawless and we are ready to continue producing a top-quality 3D Printer. We wouldn't be here today if it weren't for our initial supporters and we've devoted our lives to ensuring our company is successful.

Your contributions will go directly towards allowing us to continue building these amazing machines and hopefully provide the momentum we need to build and grow as a company.
This is not a conceptual or prototype 3D printer seeking funding to start a business.This is a Turn-Key situation. Everything we need to start production is already in place, including trained personnel. We need to beef up the business side of things by adding one or two key personnel on that side, but until we can afford them we have attracted the interest of some key mentors. We are being guided carefully, we are working extra hard and we are absolutely committed to seeing how far we can take this amazing company.

Zeni Kinetic is managed by a small group of very hard-working and dedicated individuals whom have made great sacrifices and are committed to ensuring the success of the business. This determination stems from an unwavering confidence in the quality of Zeni's unique 3D Printer and the determination and drive to make 3D Printing more accessible, affordable and enjoyable for the general public. At Zeni Kinetic, we believe heart and soul that 3D Printing will change the world and we strive to be at the forefront of this new technological revolution.

Your Contribution
 Your contributions will be used for the following: 
Secure an inventory of parts to build a large beginning inventory of printers, ready to be delivered right away; Hire and train a full production staff, capable of producing at least 15 printers per day.
Bring in more professional business management team members, sales, and customer service personnel. 
 
We are currently in the fundraising phase of our business plan and since investors want their money back, we think it's only right that the people who support us should get something extra back too. Therefore, we have put together a ""Charter"" club. Over the course of 5 years, you will get the value of your Indiegogo contribution back in free filament. Anybody with a 3D printer knows how fast the cost of filament adds up. We happen to be in a position to help you back.The more funding we receive, the greater our flexibility and freedom to produce more printers at a faster rate. Our long-term goals include expanding our production facility and staff as well as acquiring a bigger, higher-quality filament extrusion line. Every dollar received will be used to achieve those goals.

Timeline
The amount of funding we receive from this campaign will determine how many parts we can order and how much staff we can hire, which will factor into estimated delivery dates. We are ready to get production fired back up right away and with sufficient funding we can get up to speed very quickly. We anticipate that we will be able to get caught up with the pre-production queue within 3 months, however depending on the amount of funding we receive through this campaign, we could get caught up in as soon as one month.

We have already started back up. As of today, 9.28.2015 we are back in production. This is the first machine to roll off the new line.

We have secured some funding so far and we are getting the ball rolling again regardless of the outcome of this campaign. However your help will make a huge difference and will give us a great head start and more confidence. We want to move forward as prepared as possible for anything and everything; we are itching to get things going again.

We have approximately 60 printers in our pre-production queue. There are a few individuals who are helping us build printers on their own time but they are only capable of a couple printers per week. With your contributions we will be able to hire a full-time production staff and produce printers much, much faster than we are right now. As a rough projection, if we receive $100,000 in contributions, we will easily be able to produce 5 printers per day. If we get as much as $250,000, we can achieve 15 printers per day. Your contributions will determine how fast we are able to produce.


Risks & Challenges

  Getting production started back up is only the first step; maintaining operations is the next. The road behind us has been very bumpy but we've learned a lot from the experience we've had and we've made many changes, adjustments and improvements. We've put countless hours into eliminating problems and developing a plan for the future and it looks very bright. That being said, the future is unpredictable and obstacles are bound to present themselves again. In the past, our lack of sufficient funding has been our greatest struggle and that is why we aim to move ahead fully prepared to handle those obstacles as they come.
Our future plans revolve around a very carefully constructed projection to grow and expand only as fast as is safe and reasonable, so as to avoid becoming overburdened or encountering time constraints. All our plans and goals will be worked towards in a paced, diligent manner and no big decisions will be made without full confidence, preparedness and a backup plan. Rigorous quality control checks and standards have been put in place in order to avoid further production delays and ensure an excellent product. Preparedness is key here and more contributions means more adaptability for what the future has in store.


Other Ways You Can Help If you can't contribute, you can still help! We need to gain traction and build momentum and support behind us in order to ensure a sustainable future, so please share our campaign with your friends and family. Positive exposure is critical for us and every little bit counts!
