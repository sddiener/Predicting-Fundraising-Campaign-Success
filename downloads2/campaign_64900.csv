I am XShuai C3 Smart Robot Vacuum Cleaner, but you can simply call me Andy*, it’s way easier, right? If you are wondering whether you might need me around or not, let me give you 1 indisputable fact and 6 reasons that will add some clarity to your concerns:</p><p><strong>LIFE FACT:</strong> vacuuming is boring, time-consuming, and doesn’t go along anymore with nowadays’ fast-paced society. Who wants to waste time cleaning underneath the furniture and around every corner of the house when you can be doing other exciting things instead?</p><p><strong>6 REASONS WHY I’M RIGHT FOR YOU:</strong></p><p>1. I have an <strong>integrated camera, speakers and microphone to video chat</strong>. Use the Huiba app -available for iOS and Android, and connect on real-time. You will be able to see what’s going on at home, check on your family and talk to them, or even keep an eye on your pet and see how he is doing! They will never feel lonely again!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497954685/hu9sektz83gsbgqxzmg2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>2. I am super smart, so smart that I am already using <strong>Amazon’s Alexa Voice Control</strong>. You can call my name and ask me to get started or to turn off so I can go to sleep to get ready for the next time you need me.</p><p>3. Do you have pets? They will love me! Sure that they will doubt me at the beginning, and probably the cat will keep an eye on me for some time, but eventually they will trust me. And I am great at <strong>removing pet hair</strong> from the floor or carpets! </p><p>4. I am ready 24/7. Call my name and I will be there. Or simply <strong>schedule my cleaning </strong>time so I can clean when you are not at home. Is there anything better than coming back to a clean home after a long day at work? It's the dream come true!</p><p>5. If I am cleaning while you are at home, do not worry, I’ll try to be <strong>super quiet</strong>. The noise level I produce is under 71 decibels (similar to some background music in a restaurant), you won’t even notice that I am there. I won't bother you while you watch your favourite TV shows, nor the kids will wake up because of me.</p><p>6. I have great smart features at a <strong>small price</strong>. Vacuum robots as myself aren't a $50 thing, I know. But what's great about me is that I have the latest technology for a fraction of the price of other bots out there.

<h1><b><h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2></b></h1>
<br/>
<p>Over the past two years, we've worked extremely hard to prepare our product for Indiegogo and full-time manufacturing. The Drowse Buster you see in the video is a real, working prototype.</p>
<p>During the manufacturing stages, which include designing and creating the tooling to manufacture a product of this kind, it took us nearly 2 months of lead time to create the mold. In order to achieve the best results, we partner with tooling manufacturers closely and communicate frequently.</p>
<p>As the Drowse Buster gears up for production, minor adjustments were made to improve the final product. Pre-production prototypes are made to test and refine the product.  This allows us to incorporate our adjustments according to the feedback we received from testing. This will always be for the benefit of you - the consumer - and we will let you know exactly how and why any changes are made.</p>
<p>We will be working with certified manufacturers who have years of experience delivering excellent products in enormous quantities. There will no doubt be some surprises along the road, but any obstacle will be addressed by combining our internal knowledge with external expertise, and an overall goal of making the best possible product for you, our Drowse Buster customer.</p>
<p>With your support, we can bring Drowse Buster onto ears worldwide. While we're close to entering packaging, your contribution will help fund:</p>
<p>- Large bulk Orders </p>
<p>- Expanding color types</p>

This smart device can be used for situations such as nodding off while driving, studying at the library, attending meetings, and other situations where being awake and alert is important.  Drowsy driving is something invisible, underestimated and very dangerous. According to CarInsurance.com, 68% of traffic accidents involved drowsy driving in US in 2013.             This is where human being's eye acupuncture point is.   Clip these on your earlobes.

Risks & Challenges

Over the past two years, we've worked extremely hard to prepare our product for Indiegogo and full-time manufacturing. The Drowse Buster you see in the video is a real, working prototype.
During the manufacturing stages, which include designing and creating the tooling to manufacture a product of this kind, it took us nearly 2 months of lead time to create the mold. In order to achieve the best results, we partner with tooling manufacturers closely and communicate frequently.
As the Drowse Buster gears up for production, minor adjustments were made to improve the final product. Pre-production prototypes are made to test and refine the product.  This allows us to incorporate our adjustments according to the feedback we received from testing. This will always be for the benefit of you - the consumer - and we will let you know exactly how and why any changes are made.
We will be working with certified manufacturers who have years of experience delivering excellent products in enormous quantities. There will no doubt be some surprises along the road, but any obstacle will be addressed by combining our internal knowledge with external expertise, and an overall goal of making the best possible product for you, our Drowse Buster customer.
With your support, we can bring Drowse Buster onto ears worldwide. While we're close to entering packaging, your contribution will help fund:
- Large bulk Orders 
- Expanding color types

</div></div>","When you go out for a long time, who will take care of your plants?
Or even if you are at home, sometimes you forget to water the flowers?

Many times you have to let it wither, which is such a sad thing.
This time around, we present you Norshire Automatic Drip Irrigation Kit the world’s smallest and most portable Drip Irrigation Kit with uncompromised performance.



AUTOMATED DRIP IRRIGATION KIT: Combine pump and (30) day timer in 1 automatic drip watering system. Watering home&office potted plants quantitative & timing after simply set up the drip watering schedule and enjoy the freedom of having your plants automatically self-watered.Enjoy your plants thrive and growing healthy, with absolutely no effort! You can not only save your time and energy, but also enjoy healthy plants with full water and shiny leaves.
DIGITAL TIMER DISPLAY: Featuring an extra OLED screen with bright, easy-to-read text and dial. Programming, set-up, and scheduling is simple. Screen is backlit enabling to set the water timer schedule at night. In addition to showing the time, it can also show the indoor temperature.
TWO TYPES OF POWER: Running this system from 2 pcs of AA batteries or Type-c USB power. This is the only redundant power system on the market. If USB power fails the pump will continue to run on AA batteries (if batteries are installed).Excellent for urban patios and balconies where faucets are unavailable.
PROGRAM MEMORY:Once programmed, the settings are stored in internal memory automatically. Custom programming and settings will remain in memory even if power is removed. There will be no need to reprogram the water timer every time batteries are changed.       

                                                                                                                               
It can be used in many ways, and it is so simple:

We can fix it on the wall, using a magnet or a piece of 3M double-sided tape.

Our design team insists on the white appearance, because it can look the same color as the wall, beautiful and quiet, you don't seem to feel its existence.



It can work like a pump, and the source of water can be a cup, a bucket, or even a tank or a pond.


 

If it is a plant that does not need a lot of water, you can use a Coke plastic bottle or a mineral water bottle if you only need to water the plant for 5 seconds a week, such as the cactus. A bottle of water can satisfy the water supply of this plant for half a year.

It can connect up to 2.5L plastic cola bottles. Note that the mouth threads of cola plastic bottles are different from those of mineral water bottles.


You can use the accessories we provide to divide a pipe into multiple pipes, so that you can water many plants at the same time.
Layout example：


The following are some scenarios in the actual use of our products:



Type 1: Use the USB of TYPE-C to supply power directly. It can work on standby for a long time, and the data set by the user will be saved, even if the power is accidentally cut off and powered back on, it will still work on time.

Type 2: It has a built-in AA (1450) battery warehouse, you can use two 1.5V rechargeable batteries, use TYPE-C 's USB charging line to charge the battery, or you can use ordinary dry batteries that can be bought in the supermarket. 

This kind of battery can make this equipment work continuously for an hour. What? Two batteries can only work for an hour? It doesn't matter, because it only works for 10 seconds a day to meet the plant's daily water supply, so it can work for more than 180 days. The internal CPU uses the world's most advanced low-power chip, and its static working current is less than 1UA, which means that a pair of batteries can keep the device dormant for three years.

<div style=""text-align: justify;""> <h3>The Story so far...</h3>
<div>
<p>We want to take some time and explain what we have been doing for the past three years, even before we created Verdech IKE. Quantum Smart Table is a project that has already been worked for several years.</p>
<p>When we consived the idea we started with a small wooden box with minimal features; the idea was to create a multi-touch table using existing and cheap technology. In other words it was a small project created as a proof of concept. The first prototype model consisted of a small TFT screen, lights and a few cameras; there was no computer system included or any other special features.</p>
<div style=""width: 100%;"">
<div style=""float: left; width: 50%; text-align: center;"">
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431339597/xwggvc1l4s0jsbectd0b.jpg"" src="""" style=""border-radius: 25px;""/>

</div>
</div>
<p>The next step was to improve the frame holder, add a computer system inside and include software which added some functionality to our project. The overall design now was better since we had a steel frame instead of wooden, improved lightning, infrared tracking and a better display. The result was promising and motivated us to push even further!</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>After many different attempts, trial and error, we strived for improvement; we decided to go public with our product. We launched market research in order to see what the people prefer and we reached our first Quantum Smart Table prototype. We completely changed the technology used so far and instead of infrared sensors and cameras we moved to projected capacitive technology,  a true table form factor with a 42"" LED HD screen and a powerful computer system embeded.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431342382/jnkqgkorljxmzpr250ib.jpg"" src="""" style=""border-radius: 25px;""/></p>
<p>It was time to showcase our product to the people and receive feedback. Initial feedback was impressive. However people highlighted a small detail that did not catch our attention thus far. People needed new legs as the old ones did not fit the table. It was time to make the table a bit more adjustable; new legs, new design and the option to change the height was the next step!</p>

 The Story so far...

We want to take some time and explain what we have been doing for the past three years, even before we created Verdech IKE. Quantum Smart Table is a project that has already been worked for several years.
When we consived the idea we started with a small wooden box with minimal features; the idea was to create a multi-touch table using existing and cheap technology. In other words it was a small project created as a proof of concept. The first prototype model consisted of a small TFT screen, lights and a few cameras; there was no computer system included or any other special features.








The next step was to improve the frame holder, add a computer system inside and include software which added some functionality to our project. The overall design now was better since we had a steel frame instead of wooden, improved lightning, infrared tracking and a better display. The result was promising and motivated us to push even further!








After many different attempts, trial and error, we strived for improvement; we decided to go public with our product. We launched market research in order to see what the people prefer and we reached our first Quantum Smart Table prototype. We completely changed the technology used so far and instead of infrared sensors and cameras we moved to projected capacitive technology,  a true table form factor with a 42"" LED HD screen and a powerful computer system embeded.

It was time to showcase our product to the people and receive feedback. Initial feedback was impressive. However people highlighted a small detail that did not catch our attention thus far. People needed new legs as the old ones did not fit the table. It was time to make the table a bit more adjustable; new legs, new design and the option to change the height was the next step!

At the moment we are finalizing our new design and getting ready for production. Here is a quick look of our ready for production commercial design.












 What We Need & What You Get

We need your support in order to raise the funds needed for the minimum requirement of parts as well as the cost for creating a mold and production line for our product. The funds received from this campaign will be used for the molding, production and packaging process.
We need at least € 100,000 in order to cover the cost of production for Quantum Smart Table. In case we don’t achieve the € 100,000 goal and you have purchased your own Quantum Smart Table then you will receive our current design as shown in the section above. If we meet our goal then the design of the table you will get is the one shown below.

Every penny will be used for research and development that is required to turn our prototype into a full-fledged consumer product. In return, you will get the most amazing smart table you have ever dreamed.

<li>DMCA takedown requests on the VPN servers. These happen since some people abuse the VPN servers to serve copyrighted content. We've however dealt with this many times before and have a number of backup server locations.</li>

<li>Information requests from governments. As a registered company we can't refuse to comply. We however counter this by not logging any activity, so we have nothing to turn over. In addition this is a Dutch company, meaning we respond to Dutch requests only (so not the US or other countries)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Opportunities and Future Perspectives</h2>

<h3>Introducing: The BrewBell</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The BrewBell is the world's first miniature, cast bronze kettlebell bottle opener, perfect for those who like to work hard and play hard.</p>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I've partnered with the expert artisans at Mystic Valley Foundry in Somerville, and already produced a limited run of 10 parts, but now I want to take my project to the next level and get a full production run manufactured so that I can start selling online and to local shops. My goal is to have my first 100+ parts finished in time for the holidays.</p>
<p>I'm excited to offer two gorgeous finish options; raw bronze, and classic powder coated black.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1572838706/xzmwunvwg94wjvtpyqz6.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1572838759/wj6pygn4tvb3lf3ujik9.jpg"" src=""""/><br/>If I don't reach the entire goal, I'll still be able to order however many BrewBells are ordered (even if I only have one backer!), but a larger orders are required to keep the cost low, and will enable me to start selling the BrewBell in an online storefront and in local retail stores around Boston. </p>
</div>
<h2>The BrewBell Story</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm an industrial designer, and bringing products from an idea to a reality is my passion, I've  worked on medical devices, consumer electronics, home goods and these days, electric vehicles. And I know a thing or two about metal working; I apprenticed as a blacksmith for two years at a living history museum, learning 17th century English methods and techniques. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1572837197/hf37iikeib7le8pwzkh0.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/>I'm also passionate about fitness and functional movement training, and I've loved the simplicity and raw functionality of the kettlebell ever since I first started training with them over a decade ago. </p>
<p>When I was studying design at Mass Art, I didn't have time to take many classes outside the department, but I convinced some folks in the foundry department to let me participate in a bronze pour, as long as I showed up and put in the extra work. I wanted to learn about the process, and when trying to decide what I should cast, One day, working out in my basement, I was inspired by the iconic form of the kettlebell; the handle looked similar to the ""church key"" style of bottle opener, and so I made a mold and cast my first prototypes in wax, then in bronze.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1572837261/y4tbyzsy4qbqyfthtdv6.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The result was a huge success; functional, pleasing to use, and a great conversation piece! I got so much interest from friends and family that I made a new mold and had a small sample run cast in bronze at a local foundry in Somerville Massachusetts. The BrewBell was born.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The BrewBell is proudly manufactured in my own neighborhood, by a foundry that was established in 1936, and I'm excited to be working with one of the businesses that makes Somerville an amazing place for artists, makers, and creatives of all kinds. </p>

</div></div>","Introducing: The BrewBell
 
The BrewBell is the world's first miniature, cast bronze kettlebell bottle opener, perfect for those who like to work hard and play hard.
 

What We Need & What You Get
I've partnered with the expert artisans at Mystic Valley Foundry in Somerville, and already produced a limited run of 10 parts, but now I want to take my project to the next level and get a full production run manufactured so that I can start selling online and to local shops. My goal is to have my first 100+ parts finished in time for the holidays.
I'm excited to offer two gorgeous finish options; raw bronze, and classic powder coated black.

If I don't reach the entire goal, I'll still be able to order however many BrewBells are ordered (even if I only have one backer!), but a larger orders are required to keep the cost low, and will enable me to start selling the BrewBell in an online storefront and in local retail stores around Boston. 

The BrewBell Story
 
I'm an industrial designer, and bringing products from an idea to a reality is my passion, I've  worked on medical devices, consumer electronics, home goods and these days, electric vehicles. And I know a thing or two about metal working; I apprenticed as a blacksmith for two years at a living history museum, learning 17th century English methods and techniques. 
I'm also passionate about fitness and functional movement training, and I've loved the simplicity and raw functionality of the kettlebell ever since I first started training with them over a decade ago. 
When I was studying design at Mass Art, I didn't have time to take many classes outside the department, but I convinced some folks in the foundry department to let me participate in a bronze pour, as long as I showed up and put in the extra work. I wanted to learn about the process, and when trying to decide what I should cast, One day, working out in my basement, I was inspired by the iconic form of the kettlebell; the handle looked similar to the ""church key"" style of bottle opener, and so I made a mold and cast my first prototypes in wax, then in bronze.

The result was a huge success; functional, pleasing to use, and a great conversation piece! I got so much interest from friends and family that I made a new mold and had a small sample run cast in bronze at a local foundry in Somerville Massachusetts. The BrewBell was born.


The Impact
The BrewBell is proudly manufactured in my own neighborhood, by a foundry that was established in 1936, and I'm excited to be working with one of the businesses that makes Somerville an amazing place for artists, makers, and creatives of all kinds. 
While I haven't run a crowd-funding campaign before, I'm no stranger to designing, producing, selling and shipping handmade goods. From 2013 to 2015 I ran a successful Etsy shop called Durable Goods Manufacturing Co. making hand-made minimalist wallets and other leather goods.

We look towards traditional waste management systems, and it always falls short of satisfactory results. We started working on Binit with the simple idea of changing the way we treat kitchen waste. The core of our vision was to find a solution that is simple, smart, and convenient to use without being intrusive and interruptive of a user’s space.</p><p>We realized that segregation is the most significant problem in waste management. Even though we have several solutions to segregate waste, in the end, it’s all going to go to landfills and result in the same by-products that are damaging our environment.  Waste can be segregated using multiple techniques and ideologies. We had to find a firm ground that uses the best of all available methods and discard the flaws. After a lot of research and brainstorming for months, we had an executable solution in Binit. </p><p>Binit’s product philosophy was to address food waste disposal to be easily practiced by the masses. To find a solution that blends the traditional birthright of throwing garbage in a bin while adding a modern touch of convenience of treating it in the same bin. Add to this the freedom of controlling it with a smart phone, and a strong algorithm backing IoT and on-the-fly processing, we would have a smart bin that is advanced, easy to use, proactive, and borderline traditional. This was our dream product.</p><div>
<p>Right from the conceptual stage to the functional prototype, it has been a journey of creating a revolutionary product that transforms the way we look at garbage. As engineers, it was important that we tested Binit for nicks and flaws in the most abusive test conditions. We have spent nearly two years developing and testing the prototype. As the Binit prototype evolved, we overcame most of the above issues and made a product that is not only future ready, but also, earth friendly. The dream for perfection and creation of a complete product has driven us to push the idea into a working model for the community, and that’s how we got here. Binit is a device of patient innovation that is literally automating and digitizing waste management at homes.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:8.1pt;"">After waste is dumped into Binit and closing the lid, the waste processing starts. Binit has a specially designed shredder, which turns on and begins shredding the waste. Then, the inlet water valve opens and water flows into Binit. The food waste particles are shredded to the right size. After processing, the drain line valve opens and only the slurry flows out into the drain line. The shredder is designed to control the size of the shredded waste. This ensures smooth flow through the drain pipes without using high volumes of water or clogging the pipe. </p>

<p style=""margin-left:8.1pt;"">Binit is a Smart Waste Disposer that is a conceptual and paradigmatic redesign of traditional food waste disposers.  </p>
<p style=""margin-left:8.1pt;"">Traditional food waste disposers are largely of two types.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:8.1pt;"">1. Composters: These take at least 21 days to process the waste; needs lot of space; smells awful; and there is directly user interaction afterwards to remove, relocate, and manage the waste. Composters are not feasible in fast urban lifestyles.  </p>
<p style=""margin-left:8.1pt;"">2. Rapid dehydrators: This is the latest technology in waste management where it heats the waste and dehydrates it within a day or two. The output of this is black char that is not usable, and because of the foul-smell left behind after processing, the device needs to be cleaned every day and it consumes lot of power. It is also large and heavy.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:8.1pt;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:8.1pt;"">Binit takes the best from these solutions and makes it available to every user. First, we minimized the power needed for waste disposal in a house. Generally, waste management utilities consume a ton of energy to fulfil their task. Binit uses 20kwh/year (kilowatt hour per year). Second, we worked on a system that did the job as soon as possible. Waste is the last thing that requires your time in a kitchen. Moving a trash can, cleaning it monthly, replacing it when it gets broken, scheduling and coordinating the removal with the city’s garbage management service, and other little waste interaction processes tend to add up and take our time. We cut through all that with our solution. Third, universal savings: Binit saves time, money, energy, resources of external waste management systems. This indirectly benefits the environment and the Green Revolution movement. Considering the weight processed by each household, by using Binit you are directly participating in fighting the harm done to the planet.  </p>

</div></div>","BinitImagine your trash can as your food waste disposer!Managing kitchen waste is a daily chore that takes so much of our time in doing something so mundane.  On top of it, sink shredders are highly unreliable when it comes to efficiency and safety. The shredded waste is uneven, the blades can get damaged frequently, and the needs physical presence until the process is over .Binit is an upfront, simple solution to all food waste management in the kitchen. It’s a shredder with a brain. It’s a bin that can not only collect waste, but also grind it, process it, and drain it in one touch.   This is a utility that can revolutionize the way we handle waste at homes.Bin It, Forget ItDump all the kitchen waste into Binit and let the smart bin deal with it in the most economical and eco-friendly way. How it works A grinder crushes the waste using water. The waste is drained away into the drain line and, within two minutes, the day’s waste is done and forgotten without messing up the kitchen or clogging the pipes.Binit cleans itself like a germophobic cat after every operating cycle. This leaves the bin fresh and clean for the next use.Bin It, Leave ItEase of useUse the Binit App to schedule the grinding cycle from anywhere in the world. Just slide the lid and dump the waste inside. Also, Binit won’t start until it’s closed. It’s child-proof and elder-safe.The Binit App also monitors process cycles, operation patterns, power consumption, to optimize itself over time. Users will get maintenance alerts and monitor the device health on their phones.The promise of safety It protects itself from spoons, cups, and other metallic objects. It automatically switches off upon detection and alerts the user. This makes Binit safer and more reliable than sink grinders.Every individual Binit is tested and personally supervised. We aim to increase the lifespan of smart waste management utilities so that they are bought and forgot for years rather than months of the push-to-open cans. Leave the hygiene quotient of the kitchen to Binit; it’s safer with a smart bin than one that’s not. Binit Design Functional prototype We built the stocky looking prototype in winter of 2015.One of the main challenges we encountered was building an ecosystem that can intelligently process waste without human intervention. If it used too much water, it’s counter-intuitive to our premise and if it uses too less, well, lot of bent shredder blades. It took us over three months  to come up a working system than can not only use water efficiently, but also clean itself after a cycle.Over a period of two years, we made subtle improvements in the model and build the second wave of prototypes. We added layers of safety for the user and making it as simple to use as turning the knob on a microwave. Actually, we managed to make it even more easier to use. After this, we concept-designed various models and finalized on what we on this page: a minimalistic cylindrical shape that takes minimum space for the work it does, and has a sliding wind turbine mold as its lid. An inspiration and shout-out to the rapid pace of engineering around us.Bin It, Believe ItA solution towards an earth friendly waste management.Binit digitizes waste. Data on how much waste, amount of water used, amount of power used, etc., is available to the user. Thus, the overall behavior towards waste management can be improved when every house treats its own waste.Refuse landfills, reduce pollution, reuse water, and recycle garbage. Will we ever need the high cost landfills and million dollar incinerators that are more harmful than the waste themselves?Champion climate change The storyThe teamDealing with garbage has always been a critical issue in households, organizations, and government services. We look towards traditional waste management systems, and it always falls short of satisfactory results. We started working on Binit with the simple idea of changing the way we treat kitchen waste. The core of our vision was to find a solution that is simple, smart, and convenient to use without being intrusive and interruptive of a user’s space.We realized that segregation is the most significant problem in waste management. Even though we have several solutions to segregate waste, in the end, it’s all going to go to landfills and result in the same by-products that are damaging our environment.  Waste can be segregated using multiple techniques and ideologies. We had to find a firm ground that uses the best of all available methods and discard the flaws. After a lot of research and brainstorming for months, we had an executable solution in Binit. Binit’s product philosophy was to address food waste disposal to be easily practiced by the masses. To find a solution that blends the traditional birthright of throwing garbage in a bin while adding a modern touch of convenience of treating it in the same bin. Add to this the freedom of controlling it with a smart phone, and a strong algorithm backing IoT and on-the-fly processing, we would have a smart bin that is advanced, easy to use, proactive, and borderline traditional. This was our dream product.
Right from the conceptual stage to the functional prototype, it has been a journey of creating a revolutionary product that transforms the way we look at garbage. As engineers, it was important that we tested Binit for nicks and flaws in the most abusive test conditions. We have spent nearly two years developing and testing the prototype. As the Binit prototype evolved, we overcame most of the above issues and made a product that is not only future ready, but also, earth friendly. The dream for perfection and creation of a complete product has driven us to push the idea into a working model for the community, and that’s how we got here. Binit is a device of patient innovation that is literally automating and digitizing waste management at homes.
FAQ



How does Binit work?
 
 


After waste is dumped into Binit and closing the lid, the waste processing starts. Binit has a specially designed shredder, which turns on and begins shredding the waste. Then, the inlet water valve opens and water flows into Binit. The food waste particles are shredded to the right size. After processing, the drain line valve opens and only the slurry flows out into the drain line. The shredder is designed to control the size of the shredded waste. This ensures smooth flow through the drain pipes without using high volumes of water or clogging the pipe. 
 




Are there similar products like Binit in the market?
 


Though there are different waste management technologies in industries and large organizations, we believe we are the first to reveal a product in which the food waste is instantly processed. Also, Binit is designed for minimum user interaction – so, user has to just dump the waste in Binit and the rest is taken care off by the system.
Typically, the products are highly sophisticated, has a learning curve for the user, and very expensive. We made a device that is simpler, easier, and cheaper for the user. Binit makes the best use of waste management resources in houses, hospitals, schools and delivers a solution that is more efficient and earth friendly. This is a game changer in waste management in the years to come, when we’ll need to tackle waste generation at source and rely on smart devices to manage the problem. Binit is that smart device – today.




How easy is it to use Binit?
 


You just have to dump the waste in Binit, close the lid, and press the ‘Start’ button. That’s it. The rest is managed by Binit. And, after every instance of shredding the waste, Binit does a quick self-clean and it’s back to looking new and sparkling clean and ready for the next batch of waste.
 




What types of waste can Binit process?
 

Binit can process 100% of a family’s vegan food waste and soft bones.  Hard bones cannot be processed in the current version of Binit. We are working on our next design that can process hard bones as well.



How is Binit different from the traditional food waste disposers?
 


Binit is a Smart Waste Disposer that is a conceptual and paradigmatic redesign of traditional food waste disposers.  
Traditional food waste disposers are largely of two types.
1. Composters: These take at least 21 days to process the waste; needs lot of space; smells awful; and there is directly user interaction afterwards to remove, relocate, and manage the waste. Composters are not feasible in fast urban lifestyles.  
2. Rapid dehydrators: This is the latest technology in waste management where it heats the waste and dehydrates it within a day or two. The output of this is black char that is not usable, and because of the foul-smell left behind after processing, the device needs to be cleaned every day and it consumes lot of power. It is also large and heavy.
 
Binit takes the best from these solutions and makes it available to every user. First, we minimized the power needed for waste disposal in a house. Generally, waste management utilities consume a ton of energy to fulfil their task. Binit uses 20kwh/year (kilowatt hour per year). Second, we worked on a system that did the job as soon as possible. Waste is the last thing that requires your time in a kitchen. Moving a trash can, cleaning it monthly, replacing it when it gets broken, scheduling and coordinating the removal with the city’s garbage management service, and other little waste interaction processes tend to add up and take our time. We cut through all that with our solution. Third, universal savings: Binit saves time, money, energy, resources of external waste management systems. This indirectly benefits the environment and the Green Revolution movement. Considering the weight processed by each household, by using Binit you are directly participating in fighting the harm done to the planet.

<h3>Reason for fund raising</h3>
<p>With the initial budget of $32,000.00 total savings from my last job, we've built the first four sites, secured a data base, rented and furnished a Cameroon base office, launched cameroonrent.com three months ago, recruited and trained our first group of 12 employees and currently still recruiting.</p>
<p>Checkout cameroonrent.com. With a current success of a 100+ properties published by property owners and about 300+ daily site visitors in just five weeks of operation, our motivated to do more has tremendously increased seeing the changes we bring. But...</p>
<p>Looking at the work load ahead with all the bills, employee's salaries and operation expenses. We will definitely be running out of budget in a few months from now if we don't anticipate raising business funds.  </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Company's risk &amp; challenges. Also known as our success factors are categorized into the three factors below. </p>
<ul>
<li>Reliability, site performance and continues improvement ( Out Tech, developers and web designers).</li>
<li>Marketing. Continues advertisement (social media ads, T.V, radio, road and streets banners etc).</li>
<li>Hiring the best commercial personnel to help find property owners, visit them, talk of what we offer and assist in adding their property on the site. Currently 12+ field employee in Cameroon and need more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your backing will help us achieve these factors and keep it continues in a blink of an eye.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>CURRENT REAL ESTATE MARKET ANALYSIS ACROSS THE CONTINENT.</p>
<p>As explained in the video presentation, we have three options when it comes to finding, selling or renting a property. </p>
<p>1. Put a tag on the property</p>
<p>2. Tell your friends and family </p>
<p>3. Hire an agent or agency.</p>
<p>You will either have to walk the entire neighborhood searching for a tag on property, ask your friends and family if they've seen a tag on property, know someone that could help you find a property or you could use a real estate agent/agency and pay a fee just to visit a property that may not be of interest to you thus (Time, Money and Energy loss), adding to visiting fee, in most case you'll have to pay 100% of your monthly rent to the agent/agency if they finds a property you like. These methods usually take 1 to 3 months on average if you are lucky to find a property you like. Some individuals end up never finding a place, from my personal experience growing up in Cameroon that was me, I gave up after 6 months of continues searching for a student apartment. </p>
<p>WHY ''PUBLIC'' REAL ESTATE MARKETPLACE?</p>
<p>All similar real estate marketplace or businesses across the continent are managed by the business owners. All properties added to the site are claimed by the site and assigned to agents who in turn charges a fee per visit or a percentage of the rent or sale price. With this model, property-seekers can only visit these properties via the responsible agent and on the other hand property owners can only get in contact with renter or buyer via the responsible agent. </p>
<p>To conclude, the market is run by a third party individual from price negotiation, deciding on who buys or rents what property and thus cashing on both sides of the market.</p>
<p>With a PUBLIC market place, renter and landlords negotiate their pricing directly with no third party involved, properties are uploaded with direct contact details by property owners, not agents and within 24 hours maximum, properties get reviewed by our site administrator for legitimacy then published. Our public real estate market does not get involve in the pricing of any kind. It is just a platform where both parties meet.</p>
<p>To help Secure property owner details user will need to have a premium account on the site after login so we know who does what and when. This premium account is free but can be subjected to change depending on the need to keep the site running.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary

About me the project creator: I was born and raised in Cameroon, a graduate in Mechanical Engineering, 5+ years working in the oil&gas industry in the Houston Texas area, quit my Job to pursue a career as an entrepreneur with objective to help bring change to the continent.
At Globgreen we only focus on emerging markets, primarily adopting and modifying existing tech-concept to fit the needs of the people in the real estate market and secondarily re-investing in building modern homes and offices with objective to improve living comfort while creating thousands of jobs in each country we plan on operating across Africa.
By backing this project you will help bridge the gab between searching a home or offices space thus saving time, money and energy for the people in the need and this same backing will help provide modern infrastructure in the continent.  

PLEASE SELECT YOUR REWARD AND HELP BE A PART OF THIS PROJECT'S SUCCESS. :)

Reason for fund raising
With the initial budget of $32,000.00 total savings from my last job, we've built the first four sites, secured a data base, rented and furnished a Cameroon base office, launched cameroonrent.com three months ago, recruited and trained our first group of 12 employees and currently still recruiting.
Checkout cameroonrent.com. With a current success of a 100+ properties published by property owners and about 300+ daily site visitors in just five weeks of operation, our motivated to do more has tremendously increased seeing the changes we bring. But...
Looking at the work load ahead with all the bills, employee's salaries and operation expenses. We will definitely be running out of budget in a few months from now if we don't anticipate raising business funds.  

Risks & Challenges
Company's risk & challenges. Also known as our success factors are categorized into the three factors below. 

Reliability, site performance and continues improvement ( Out Tech, developers and web designers).
Marketing. Continues advertisement (social media ads, T.V, radio, road and streets banners etc).
Hiring the best commercial personnel to help find property owners, visit them, talk of what we offer and assist in adding their property on the site. Currently 12+ field employee in Cameroon and need more.

Your backing will help us achieve these factors and keep it continues in a blink of an eye.
The Impact
CURRENT REAL ESTATE MARKET ANALYSIS ACROSS THE CONTINENT.
As explained in the video presentation, we have three options when it comes to finding, selling or renting a property. 
1. Put a tag on the property
2. Tell your friends and family 
3. Hire an agent or agency.
You will either have to walk the entire neighborhood searching for a tag on property, ask your friends and family if they've seen a tag on property, know someone that could help you find a property or you could use a real estate agent/agency and pay a fee just to visit a property that may not be of interest to you thus (Time, Money and Energy loss), adding to visiting fee, in most case you'll have to pay 100% of your monthly rent to the agent/agency if they finds a property you like. These methods usually take 1 to 3 months on average if you are lucky to find a property you like. Some individuals end up never finding a place, from my personal experience growing up in Cameroon that was me, I gave up after 6 months of continues searching for a student apartment. 
WHY ''PUBLIC'' REAL ESTATE MARKETPLACE?
All similar real estate marketplace or businesses across the continent are managed by the business owners. All properties added to the site are claimed by the site and assigned to agents who in turn charges a fee per visit or a percentage of the rent or sale price. With this model, property-seekers can only visit these properties via the responsible agent and on the other hand property owners can only get in contact with renter or buyer via the responsible agent. 
To conclude, the market is run by a third party individual from price negotiation, deciding on who buys or rents what property and thus cashing on both sides of the market.
With a PUBLIC market place, renter and landlords negotiate their pricing directly with no third party involved, properties are uploaded with direct contact details by property owners, not agents and within 24 hours maximum, properties get reviewed by our site administrator for legitimacy then published. Our public real estate market does not get involve in the pricing of any kind. It is just a platform where both parties meet.
To help Secure property owner details user will need to have a premium account on the site after login so we know who does what and when. This premium account is free but can be subjected to change depending on the need to keep the site running.

</div></div>","GAS OFF
always be #propared

GAS OFF is currently the ONLY patented automated propane shut-off device on the market.
 
 
 
EASY TO USE

GAS OFF is simple to use and a breeze to install with no tools required at all. 


 
SAFE

GAS OFF makes grilling safer with no worries of forgetting to shut off the gas. 
Sit back, and enjoy your next cook-out with peace of mind.

 
AFFORDABLE

We plan to price GAS OFF fairly so all grill-lovers can enjoy this grill necessity as much as we do!

 
SAVES MONEY

GAS OFF saves money by saving the gas in your propane tank when you forget to turn it off.
So, the next time you turn your grill on, your propane tank will be filled, as well as your wallet.

 
ECO-FRIENDLY

GAS OFF is good for the environment by preventing unwanted gas byproducts from going into the atmosphere when you accidentally leave your propane tank on.

 
 
TRANSFERS EASILY

GAS OFF simply goes from tank to tank in mere seconds with just your bare hands. 

 

WHAT WE NEED

We need capital to add some final cosmetic touches, create the production molds and engage with the needed manufacturers to bring this product across the finish line. After final testing, GAS OFF will be shipped to backers and eventually be released in retail chains. 

 
WHY CONTRIBUTE

GAS OFF began as a conversation between two brothers who were convinced there had to be a better way to shut off the gas after cooking because all of us have forgotten to shut it off from time to time. 
They wanted to make it simple to use and a breeze to install with no tools required at all. It simply goes from tank to tank in mere seconds with just your bare hands. This can also be used as a cooking timer or if you just want to burn off the last meal you cooked on the grill. 
After 5 years of extensive engineering and design work we are proud to bring you a product that does not require the use of electrical motors and is safe and easy to operate. 
Now this is where you come in.
Once funded, our team will be hard at work to ensure that your GAS OFF device is completed and shipped.

In other words, the box responds you with different moves, every time in different speed, different frequency, and different range.


So what’s a MOODY Useless Box for? Er, basically, it's just for fun. Even a terminator would be amused by this little box. But, the real point is, to deal with your fragment time. When loading a game, waiting for dinner or taking a rest from your paperwork, anytime you pull the trigger – Tadah! Congrats, you killed your time!

Put it on your own desk, your kitchen table, or even stick it on the wall, anywhere you like, and it is always moody.



While designing this project, we met some real difficulties. The hardest part is programming the box. We had to match the range, frequency and speed, make sure they are in the right way.


We built 8 versions of prototype, so that we can develop its structure and program into optimization. Also, we solved the power supply problem by using a main switch, that you need not to replace the batteries often.

We also did some work to find the balance between a perfect size and rational use of interior space which make the product ever compact.  
Dimensions: 5.5 x 3.8 x 2.3 Inches  
Weight: 12.5 Ounces



The core of our MOODY Useless Box is a pre-programmed high-speed chip. It responds to your movements.
Adjusted gear set helps to save energy, running for longer.
The outer parts of the box are carved with laser, which makes the box shining&solid.


With your support, we could build this product in its best way: the best components, most efficient factory, and finally, bring the project to life.
Sounds cool, huh? Don't get excited too early, cause we have more surprises. Here is just a small part of the all the moves, different mood, different moves, discover more yourself!



Are you tired with picking the right B-day gift for someone? Are you trying to find some interesting&safe gadgets for your kids? You are lucky! The MOODY Useless Box is definitely perfect for you. It meets all your requirements. Besides, it's not expensive at all.





We have made a schedule for this project. But we need your support to achieve it. The design is almost done. We are raising funding for manufacturing, packaging, and shipping for this project, you can help us to bring it to a better level! Moody uselessbox would be a perfect Christmas gift!

Have you ever seen a slim and glittering mobile phone or tablet paired with a keyboard that fits the desk perfectly? Probably not. We’ve been waiting for a beautiful keyboard, and when we couldn’t wait anymore, we started this project to make what we wanted.
A More beautiful design than even mobile phone itself, a design that embraces retro styling, the feeling of a mechanical keyboard, keycaps to dramatically reduce typos, multi-pairing for many devices, and even availability of macro for setting keys at your will. We, ELRETRON INC, are finally introducing PENNA, our dream come true that took three years in the making. 
Experience the NEWTRO with PENNA, which utilizes typewriter design to create a retro feeling, while adopting the most up-to-date technology.

<div>Founder: Alireza Mrbeig</div>
<div>I'm a mechanical engineer student at CUBoulder. As a sixteen years old in Iran, I logged onto Yahoo Messages's mechanical engineering chat room hoping to find a community of intellectuals with whom I could share my questions and develop my passion. I was disappointed to find discussions that were irrelevant to the subject because users were anonymous. As I studied in Iran, Japan, Portland, and CUBoulder, where I am currently a junior, I refined my vision. I created a platform where like-minded individuals, using their college .edu, can gather online to discuss, problem-solve, debate, and collaborate.</div>
<div>About the President: Geoffrey Janke</div>
<div>I am a recent graduate of Portland State University with a degree in Public Health and a Minor in Civic Leadership. It is my passion to create connections and Simor is the perfect blend of tech. and community. Members of the Simor community find community members with common interests and common goals.

<h3>What happened so far.</h3>
<p>
At the beginning of this year we asked you to help us build a wooden geodesic dome (see <a href=""http://igg.me/at/dome/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://igg.me/at/dome/</a>). With your support and contributions we reached our funding goal (diameter: 5 meter). But, we did not reach the stretch goal for the huge wooden dome with a diameter of 10 meters. However, we were so overwhelmed by your feedback, that we put some money on top of the raised funds and built the huge dome anyway.
</p>
<p>
We will bring this dome to a lot of nice hacker, maker and cultural events over the next years. It started with <a href=""https://eh15.easterhegg.eu/site/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Easterhegg15</a> in Brunswick during Easter. During June and July this year you could see the dome at the art exhibition ""<a href=""http://kulturanker.de/die-neue-sinnlichkeit-2015/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Die Neue Sinnlichkeit</a>"" in the former prison in Magdeburg. Since a few days the dome is at <a href=""https://events.ccc.de/camp/2015/wiki/Main_Page"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CCCamp2015</a> and directly after this camp, the dome will join the <a href=""http://www.poc21.cc/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">POC21</a> innovation camp in France.<br/>
For each event we will upload (and already have) some pictures to <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/131876626@N04/albums"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Flickr</a>. <br/></p><p>If you have any ideas for future events, where you would like to see the dome, please contact us at woodendome@posteo.de.<br/></p>
<h3>What's next?</h3>
<p>
The dome is huge and awesome, but there are still some things missing: e.g. a wooden floor and an interior tent. For the CCCamp it is crucial to have a floor and an appropriate foundation, as there are some rails on the ground and the ground is mostly dirt and grass. An interior tent would be nice to have, as it protects hackers and makers from rain, wind and sun. And it might also be used as a projection area for awesome light installations, e.g. star light projection. 
</p>
<p>
For these upgrades we need your support. First of all, the wooden floor is most important and we need to build it anyway. Therefore we have chosen ""flexible funding"", since every Euro counts. We will need approximately 2000,- € for the material needed for floor and foundation. Every additional Euro will be put into the interior tent. For the tent we will need an additional amount of approx. 2000,- €.</p><p><b>UPDATE</b>: We found a nice place at the CCCamp, where a floor is not that needed: no rails, no mud, just flat and dry meadow. Additionally, we saw these nice honey comb plates, that are much more suitable for our needs; light weight, easy transportation and storage, easy to install, sustainable, and no need for foundation. The price range for these honey comb plates is almost the same as for the previous intended panel flooring. Therefore, we decided to put the funds into these honey comb plates, and of course into the interior tent.<br/>
</p>

<h3>Doctor of Procrastination</h3>
<p>
Over the last years I have worked as a researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Magdeburg and also tried to write my PhD thesis. However, writing my thesis did not go very fast, since I tend to procrastinate with geodesic structures and working with wood. The wooden dome is kind of a climax of this procrastination, but I finished the structure before Easter this year. During the last month I was therefore able to focus on my thesis ... and I also finished it. \o/

<p>The voice enabled companion Klove app helps with each step of preparing your meal. The Klove knob monitors heat settings in real time and the app alerts you when needed. Klove keeps you connected, healthy and in control.</p>

<h2>So - Is it a glorified cooking timer? No...</h2>
<p>No, Klove Knob isn't a glorified cooking timer. It adds a lot of value to consumers compared either App based timer or Alexa Timer:</p>
<ul>
<li>App timer or Alexa do not have <strong>cognitive knowledge </strong><strong>as</strong><strong> how long it takes for the food to cook</strong>. The user has to know the time required or refer a cookbook everytime they cook.</li>
<li>App timer or Alexa won't know <strong>possible ways to cook</strong> the same food, so can't offer options for setting the cooking time. For example, App timer or Alexa won't know that eggs can be hard boiled or soft boiled, or Pasta can be cooked in the pressure cooker or open pan. Hence won't offer user options to set different cooking times.</li>
<li>
<strong>Clear alert and notification:</strong> If you have multiple burners cooking at the same time, you won't know which one is ready when the timer goes off.</li>
<li>
<strong>Smart Geo-fencing:</strong> If you leave home while you are cooking, because you have a lot on your mind, you will get alerted.</li>
<li>App timer or Alexa won't<strong> learn the actual cooking</strong> time on your cooktop. Hence it cannot <strong>personalize</strong> the cooking time for you.</li>
<li>App timer or Alexa timer cannot <strong>set the time automatically</strong> as per your recipe. </li>

</div></div>","Life's too short for eh meals, or uh oh moments!
Those moments when you've just taken your eyes off the stove to get the doorbell and the milk has boiled over. Or spent hours trying to scrape the burnt muck off the bottom of the pan. All that is a thing of the past. One little knob takes you from 'Uh oh!' to 'Oh Wow!'Turn the Klove Knob to a perfectly cooked dish. Every. Single. Time.



The voice enabled companion Klove app helps with each step of preparing your meal. The Klove knob monitors heat settings in real time and the app alerts you when needed. Klove keeps you connected, healthy and in control.
Here are some big features we're excited about:

So - Is it a glorified cooking timer? No...
No, Klove Knob isn't a glorified cooking timer. It adds a lot of value to consumers compared either App based timer or Alexa Timer:

App timer or Alexa do not have cognitive knowledge as how long it takes for the food to cook. The user has to know the time required or refer a cookbook everytime they cook.
App timer or Alexa won't know possible ways to cook the same food, so can't offer options for setting the cooking time. For example, App timer or Alexa won't know that eggs can be hard boiled or soft boiled, or Pasta can be cooked in the pressure cooker or open pan. Hence won't offer user options to set different cooking times.

Clear alert and notification: If you have multiple burners cooking at the same time, you won't know which one is ready when the timer goes off.

Smart Geo-fencing: If you leave home while you are cooking, because you have a lot on your mind, you will get alerted.
App timer or Alexa won't learn the actual cooking time on your cooktop. Hence it cannot personalize the cooking time for you.
App timer or Alexa timer cannot set the time automatically as per your recipe. 



 


Here's what's behind all that smart.


 

 


Geofencing feature: Klove app reminds you to switch off the stove when you step out.

 


Trigger App from Knob: Automatically open Klove App when stove knob is turned on. This enables hands free operations rights from the beginning. Just say what you want to cook and Klove app will guide you through the recipe with voice instructions and timer control.


 


Klove Knob and App - Smart TimerE.g: Klove knows that Pasta can be boiled in an open pot or pressure cooker. Klove then sets the appropriate cooking timer based on that detail of how you cook.



Klove Knob was created out of the passion to bring joy back into the kitchen. There is one thing we're obsessed with: giving smart people smart technology. Our smart kitchen products make cooking easy and joyful. We make great technology simple.

As an active father, that participates in every aspect of the household—including laundry—it didn’t take long for Terry to realize that a toxic-free detergent was hard to find and that he wasn’t the only one spending $60 per month on many cleaning supplies loaded with dangerous ingredients that he didn’t want around his daughter or his community.The solution was Very SimpleSimple math: 100 million loads of laundry are done every day in America. If five cents were donated for each load, then almost $5 million per day could be donated to Autism, a condition that affects 1 in 68 children ages 2-17 globally. Now, that's a staggering amount of money, right? And just think, it doesn't require you do anything differently. All your humbly asked to do, is to buy from a brand that's dedicated to helping our kids.So, Terry rolled up his sleeves and got to work...He then retained the services of one the worlds leaders in design of Naturally/Green formulated products to develop his detergent using eco-friendly techniques in every aspect of production and packaging.Made with plant-derived cleaning agents, Purpus is the green formula that really cleans. Our formulas are overwhelmingly effective for removing dirt yet gentle on people, pets, and the planet. Purpus products are also derived from natural resources. We never test on animals and are a socially responsible company that cares about this earth long after we are gone.People just love our Detergent and here's what they're Saying  Why you should avoid the Toxic Detergents your presently UsingConventional laundry products often contain toxic chemicals that can harm you and the environment. While they may make your clothes smell as fresh as a spring morning, conventional laundry-care products contain chemicals with negative health effects ranging from skin and throat irritation to carcinogenicity.In fact, the laundry room may be one of the more toxic areas in your home. Researchers have found that dryer vents can emit more than 25 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) when scented laundry detergent and dryer sheets are used, including seven VOCs classified as hazardous air pollutants. This is particularly concerning when dryers don’t vent outside or are blocked, causing indoor air pollution.How we Formulated Purpus to protect your Child and YouWe formulate our products using the principle, ""Would I use this on my child?"" If any ingredient has a questionable risk of causing harm to our loved ones or to the environment, we simply don't use it.The Best Green Cleaner money can buy! Purpus products, are formulated with the best plant-based ingredients available, they are highly effective but yet designed to be gentle.Green chemistry is more than leading edge. Purpus is designed to help make you, your child and the planet a safer and better place. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a general term for a group of complex disorders of brain development. These disorders are characterized, in varying degrees, by difficulties in social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication, and repetitive behaviors. About 1 percent of the world population has autism spectrum disorder. Prevalence in the United States is estimated at 1 in 68 births. More than 3.5 million Americans live with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Autism is the fastest-growing developmental disability.

<h2>Why Soundots?</h2>
<p><strong>Soundots Ai-2 is a compact speaker capable of playing high-quality sound in true stereo </strong>with a clarity and a bass response like you’ve never heard before. That’s all well and good, but the true power of Soundots lies in its capability of stacking with others of its kind.</p>

<p>If that sounds confusing, think of it like this: you have three Soundots. You can use your three Soundots as three separate Bluetooth speakers. You can also stack those three Soundots together, vertically, horizontally, or both, and they will instantly start playing together. Suddenly you have a soundbar for your TV and a beefy sound system for your party next Saturday.</p>
<p><i>But how is this possible?</i>, you ask with a confounded look upon your face.</p>
<p>It’s all done with the help of... c o m p u t e r s.</p>
<p>Yep, there’s a built-in artificial intelligence. We made it in-house in Sweden. We then named it aiFi and started rocking. Because that’s exactly what aiFi does. It makes sure that no matter how you stack your Soundots, the sound system optimizes the audio for you.</p>

<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>In 2015 we successfully ran and fulfilled an Indiegogo campaign. That's how we funded our first generation of Soundots (it was called AiFi at the time). We are familiar with the challenges and risks that come with a crowdfunding campaign and we are not starting from scratch. Ever since the launch of the Ai-1, we have been working on improving the Soundots formula, along with the associated hardware, applications and technology. Our team is made up of some of the brightest minds in the industry and we have confidence that we will deliver beyond your expectations.</p>
<p>However, we do ask for your understanding regarding the possibility of delays. It's not uncommon that something unforeseen happens that will compromise the quality of the final product unless carefully handled. We will not release the Ai-2 before we are absolutely happy with it.</p>

A substantial update to the main processor with four times the capacity of that in the Ai-1. 

Words From Our Reviewers.

We also encourage you to read about us over at these publications:

How Does Soundots Stack Up?
Below, you can read more about the power that you gain from stacking Soundots together. Note that the raw equivalent power expands exponentially as you stack more and more.
 

Technical Stuff
Interested in the details of one Soundots Ai-2? Awesome! We hope this tables will satisfy your curiosity regarding the inner workings of Soundots. If not, don't hesitate to contact us! We'll happily answer any questions you might have.

The Prototype
Soundots Ai-2 is currently under development. Below, you can catch a peak at the first prototype, spray-painted black so that we could at least get a feel for what the matte black is going to look like when it's blasting some tunes for us later this year.

Risks & Challenges
In 2015 we successfully ran and fulfilled an Indiegogo campaign. That's how we funded our first generation of Soundots (it was called AiFi at the time). We are familiar with the challenges and risks that come with a crowdfunding campaign and we are not starting from scratch. Ever since the launch of the Ai-1, we have been working on improving the Soundots formula, along with the associated hardware, applications and technology. Our team is made up of some of the brightest minds in the industry and we have confidence that we will deliver beyond your expectations.
However, we do ask for your understanding regarding the possibility of delays. It's not uncommon that something unforeseen happens that will compromise the quality of the final product unless carefully handled. We will not release the Ai-2 before we are absolutely happy with it.",12.0,2,"2 Campaigns

                                                      Choose from the 4 pre-installed programs                                      Put it in any freezer for 10 min. or fridge for 20 min.  Shipment has started! 12th, May 2020      Warm drinks are just the worst. Once we’ve opened up a warm one, we all regret it, wasting what could have been an ice-cold refreshment and knowing that it’s not the same, but none of us have the time to sit and wait up to 50 minutes for our drinks to get cooler in the freezer or even 2 hours in the fridge without InnoChiller!You can put your drinks into the freezer, but you’ll still be waiting at least 50 minutes. With the InnoChiller, be the saviour of the party by cooling drinks to the perfect temperature in under 10 minutes.   So versatileCool down anything you wish in the InnoChiller  Not only is InnoChiller great for drinks, but it can also speed up the freezing process of ice cubes and fast freezing of meats to preserve the flavors.  Don’t Worry About Over-freezing Your Drinks Into An Icy State. With the alarm and & timer functions, you’ll hear when your drinks are ready to... Drink! Choose from 4 pre-installed programs that suit the drink you want cooling.When the program has finished the InnoChiller will sound an alarm to let you know it's done and it will, of course, stop the fan so the cooling process is slowed down. Each program has been timed according to the experiences we have had by testing the InnoChiller over and over again..... hic!     The InnoChiller works by blowing cold air over your warm beverages, utilizing the effect from wind-chill. The InnoChiller uses forced convection (the process of energy exchanged through air or liquids) to create the chill effect. The InnoChiller helps the speeding up of the energy exchange by increasing the airflow around the beverage and thereby improving the convection.  The temperature conversion takes place in 3 steps:
Convection from the cold freezer air through the boundary layer of air on the can 
Conduction through the solid aluminum can that contains the beer 
Convection from the aluminum through the beer on the inside of the aluminum can.
This chilling effect is exactly the same thing you feel when you step outside on a cold day with high winds - it feels much colder than it actually is. We encourage you to test your own perfect timing as the results can vary depending on these 4 factors which can change how the performance of InnoChiller is perceived:The temperature inside the freezer.Freezer size.Goods already stored in the freezer.Beverage temp. preference.No matter what, you will always cool down your drinks much faster regardless of what freezer you have available. And remember, you can also use the InnoChiller in your fridge, just run the program twice.    No. We get asked this urban legend a lot.The cold air inside a freezer can't contain as much water, and will soon be saturated with the maximum amount of water vapor after a brief cooling down period. This prevents the wet towel from evaporating. The evaporation depends on humidity of air, and the humidity of air in a freezer largely depends on condensation on the surface of the cooling elements, and thereby defeats the whole purpose wrapping a wet towel around your bottle. By adding a wet towel to your bottle you actually insulate the bottle with one more layer of resistance, if the water can't evaporate. This means the heat transfer now need to go through 5 steps instead of only 3:
Convection from the cold freezer air through the boundary layer of air on the wet towel. 
Conduction through the wet paper towel. 
Convection through the water between the towel and the bottle. 
Conduction through the solid glass bottle that contains the wine. 
Convection from the bottle through the wine on the inside of the bottle
                    Temperature measured from the center of the liquid inside the bottle Confused? Don't be! The InnoChiller is incredibly efficient, it even outperforms a bucket of ice and water in many cases.   The specially designed fan ensures a high airflow across the products you wish to cool down. The fan has also been designed to overcome various kinds of resistance inside the InnoChiller, this means you can pretty much fill up the whole InnoChiller with beverages and the fan will still be able to squeeze air past your drinks.  We have chosen a 21700 type cell which is capable of delivering 4000 mAh. This makes it possible to run the InnoChiller for 45 min. inside the freezer. Did you know - The next generation of Tesla cars will have battery packages based on this type of cell and it is widely known as a high capacity and highly reliable Li-Ion cell. Cool right?After the battery has discharged completely you can still use the InnoChiller, simply connect the charger and flat-cord USB cable through the door on your freezer and continue to cool down beers for your thirsty guests all night.  To make it easy and quick to use the InnoChiller we have made a visual interface with a 1.3"" 128x64 pixels OLED display which makes it very easy to select a program. The reason for choosing an OLED screen is because of its good performance at low temperatures.     *The InnoChiller has been made so it fits in almost every home freezer. Whether it’s a large kitchen freezer or small European door-freezer. We’ve made it as small as possible while making sure it’s versatile, ensuring it can hold up to 6 beers/soft drinks and a lot of other beverages.   Don't have a freezer? You can use InnoChiller in the fridge. Simply run the program twice - easy!   In each package you will find:One InnoChiller.Ice Cube tray with lid.Charger (with your country's socket).2m flat-cord USB cable.Manual. Choose from these two colors:   In the first quarter of 2019 we received the very first prototypes from the factory in China and we were thrilled to see the result and we soon after ordered the first test batch. This test batch was shipped to us in June and it also proved to exceed our expectations, so we feel very confident that all design hurdles, logistics, supplies etc, is completely set and ready to scale up. At the moment we are producing the first large scale batch which will be delivered to our backers in January.  Production August 2019Below are some photos from the production start-up in August 2019, we will continue to add updates production progress.  Photos of the first plastic componentsThe photos from the completed components will be added to this section here. Later we will also add photos from the assembly line and finally pictures of the actual fulfillment process. Make sure to follow the updates for instant notification on the progress.         Meeting with packaging supplier      Completed Main Compartments    Ice Cube Trays InnoChiller foundersMads and JesperWe are both engineers and 31 years old. We started InnoChiller in 2016 after a few months of initial testing. The idea for the InnoChiller came to be on a normal Tuesday evening where we were drinking a decent amount of beers until it happened - we had no more cold beers left. Of course we panicked and quickly threw some beers into the freezer and waited for them to get cold. We waited for some 50 min. before we felt the beers was cold enough to drink, and in that time we discussed ways of cooling down faster than the freezer could do it. We looked for ice cubes but we had used the rest on making Mojitos the day before... so we tried to put wet paper towel around the beers and then throw them in the freezer, but still no improved result. Jesper was working with industrial refrigeration design at the time and he suggested we could use the same technique as they use in big slaughterhouses to quick cooling the meat, simply blow cold air over the beers and see what happens. It worked! And we started developing a solution that could run on battery inside the cold environment of a freezer. This idea also gave us a good excuse to get together and ""test"" the InnoChiller frequently, and the rest is history. Cheers!",37.0,0,"1 Campaign

And the applications aren't just health-related - LAMP Diagnostics could be used for a whole world of environmental samples.

That’s how the box turns into a stereo speaker. The cardboard we use, was once used in the industrial sector to pack and protect heavy (and expensive) components and machinery. This material Is eco-friendly, It Is light but, thanks to its multilayer composition, is also very robust and extra resistant (1.4 cm thick and certification of resistance according to Fefco standards). It is assembled without the use of any glue, 90% made of recycled material and 100% recyclable. Try it, we do it every day.Milan Design Week 2019We exhibited at FuoriSalmone in Lambrate Design District, in an unconventional and special design location, where we showed all our products online on www.rippotai.it,  we could let people test Soundpotai. The surprise in their faces and all their positive comments made us proud and sure this campaign could succeed. Reviews from real testersMariantonietta L. “When I sat down I thought it didn't hold me but it's sturdy and then the sound is beautiful. It feels like wearing music”.Daniele L. “It's beautiful.”Andrea V. “A design object! I didn't think that cardboard, even if hard and resistant, could make so much. I fell in love.”Helene C. “My legs were shaking with music, and it wasn't even loud. I must have just made a funny face. Very cool. I have to have it at home.”Sergio D. “Man, everything vibrates. Music is heard everywhere!”Lorenza T. “Sincere congratulations. A product I didn't know at all. And then I like the idea of sustainability. I take care about that at home.”Silvia Maria A. “The sound is enveloping. It seems to be at a concert.”Davide V. “Natural sound, great.”Benedetta Z. “You can't understand, until you try it you don't believe it.”

Elena and Tito are the two founding partners who deal with all the strategic and creative experience of La Fattory, the company that owns the Rippotai brand.Elena - “Yes, La Fattory, without the English C. A mix between the Italian word “fattoria” which in English means “farm” and the correct word factory.That’s because we consider our company as a place where you work hard as in a farm of ideas and experiences in which creativity is sown every day. And where respect for the environment and sustainability is a true value, a mission for every future development.”Tito - “La Fattory is a laboratory of ideas that carries out tailor-made communication projects. We give companies all the attention and support they deserve to define the strategy and then apply the style that makes them unique. Rippotai was born just thinking about a tailor-made project for one of our customers that required an innovative and sustainable gift for its customers.Later we transformed the boxes for the house and the office into real design objects and our home decor cubes became: lamps, chairs, games for children.”Elena - “When we thought of even putting music in it, we didn't imagine that it would do so well.”Elena and Tito are the founders of Rippotai, they met for sporadic collaborations and now besides being colleagues and partners, they are good friends in life.As well as being the CEO, Tito is the top designer and art director of the company. It is thanks to him that the Rippotai world is so colorful and exciting.Elena is the meeting point with reality, she materializes dreams with strategy and a firm attitude. And in her spare time ... she translates everything into all the languages she knows (she is polyglot).Giovanni and Andrea: they are our two accelerators “angels”, who believed so much in this project that became part of the company.Giovanni is a startup and fundraising expert. Hard worker, he is a sport enthusiast who believes sport is a school of life for all entrepreneurs. Pragmatic, dreamer and with an entrepreneurial spirit, he prefers numbers to words. He is our CFO and manages all the numbers and sometimes... us!Andrea is our reference for everything related to digital innovation and business communication and organizational models, he is  our connection with universities and business schools for his various collaboration with the Sapienza University of Rome and other Business Schools. Roberto is our technical audio engineer. He is an architect, design lover and obviously he is very fond of audio systems.

L’amplificatore di potenza di 50W riceve il segnale audio dai dispositivi bluetooth o da dispositivi collegati tramite la presa jack di ingresso AUX.I diffusori collegati all’amplificatore sono due Sound Exciter (eccitatori sonori). Gli Exciter sono costituiti da un gruppo motore, una bobina mobile e un sistema di sospensione. Sono applicati alle pareti della box e rilasciando le onde sonore fanno vibrare il cartone. La box si trasforma così in un altoparlante stereo. Specifiche tecniche

 Il teamElena e Tito sono i due soci fondatori che si occupano di tutta l’esperienza strategica e creativa de La Fattory, l’azienda proprietaria del brand Rippotai.Elena - “Rippotai è un’idea coltivata con cura e passione da La Fattory.

E dove il rispetto dell’ambiente e della sostenibilità sono un valore vero, una missione per ogni sviluppo futuro.”Tito - “La Fattory è un laboratorio di idee che realizza progetti di comunicazione tailor made per le aziende. Rippotai è nato proprio pensando ad un progetto per uno dei nostri clienti che ci ha richiesto un gift innovativo e sostenibile per i suoi clienti. In seguito abbiamo trasformato le scatole per la case e l’ufficio in veri e propri oggetti di design e i nostri cubi d'arredo sono diventati: lampade, sedute, giochi per bambini.”Elena - “Quando abbiamo pensato di metterci dentro addirittura la musica non immaginavamo che ci sarebbe riuscito così bene.”Elena and Tito sono i fondatori di Rippotai, si sono incontrati per collaborazioni sporadiche e ora, oltre ad essere colleghi e partner, sono amici nella vita.Tito oltre ad essere il CEO,è il top designer nonché art director dell'azienda. E' grazie a lui se il mondo Rippotai è così colorato ed entusiasmante.Elena è il punto d'incontro con la realtà, concretizza i sogni con strategia e piglio deciso.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Kat Granke and I am a Master's in Mental Health and Wellness Counseling student from NYU. I have been working with children my entire life through babysitting, programming, behavioral therapy and my education to counsel them. I see so many children fall behind in school because they are not getting the resources to learn that they need, and I am here to provide that. </p>
<p>This desk combines the needs of kiddos, who are unique in each of them, with the benefits proven in fidgeting. Beyond that, it combines the need for the body to release energy in a productive way, which is usually the energy leading to distractibility. If we can help children to mindlessly release pent-up energy, we are providing them the chance to learn in their own ways.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>I am looking to raise the money to get this project off the ground- and manufacturing multiples is rough to afford as a student.</li>
<li>I am grateful for any donations, but the more the better. The more money raised, the more product can be made, and the more exposure and market research can happen.</li>
<li>I am a one-woman operation as of now, and I made this to change lives and help children to be able to learn better. All donations will go to manufacturing the product until there is a sustainable profit coming in. </li>
<li>Those who donate will get a 20% discount off of the purchase of their first TheraDesk!</li>

My name is Kat Granke and I am a Master's in Mental Health and Wellness Counseling student from NYU. I have been working with children my entire life through babysitting, programming, behavioral therapy and my education to counsel them. I see so many children fall behind in school because they are not getting the resources to learn that they need, and I am here to provide that. 
This desk combines the needs of kiddos, who are unique in each of them, with the benefits proven in fidgeting. Beyond that, it combines the need for the body to release energy in a productive way, which is usually the energy leading to distractibility. If we can help children to mindlessly release pent-up energy, we are providing them the chance to learn in their own ways.

What We Need & What You Get

I am looking to raise the money to get this project off the ground- and manufacturing multiples is rough to afford as a student.
I am grateful for any donations, but the more the better. The more money raised, the more product can be made, and the more exposure and market research can happen.
I am a one-woman operation as of now, and I made this to change lives and help children to be able to learn better. All donations will go to manufacturing the product until there is a sustainable profit coming in. 
Those who donate will get a 20% discount off of the purchase of their first TheraDesk!


The Impact
We all know that the children of today are the future of tomorrow, and the following is what this project can do to help them discover their own potential. 

Less distractibility for kiddos while trying to complete work.
Increased confidence for children who are able to learn without as much difficulty
Providing an outlet for kiddos provides parents less arguments over work!


Risks & Challenges
The biggest risk is taking a new idea and putting it to the world in a way they may not be ready for; but I believe that this risk can change the lives  and education of many kiddos and their families.

<h3>The story</h3>
<p>What started as a project for a modular shelf system developed into a whole family of different furniture building kits offering a modularity as free and flexible as the building blocks we all grew up with and loved as children. Inspired by classic toys and famous truss structures we kept on developing the system without however compromising on the simplicity of our initial concept. In order to maximize the number of designs that are possible with our basic elements, we calculated and tested a number of different sizes and distances between the holes in the various elements.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617016796/gsrjvhtjkkfq7kxefhfr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In addition, we found that the flexibility and bendability of our straight elements opened up a whole new range of possibilities.</p>

<p>At this point, we decided to stop creating new kits and introduce the system to the public through crowd funding, in order to give our customers an open creative space and also to allow us to be inspired by your creations.</p>

</div></div>","We wanted to improve the way you live your home or your favorite spaces and we did it by creating a unique, smart solution to meet your needs and standards.  Feel free to enjoy your favorite voice assistant, ezon.io is always ready for you.

ezon.io does not disturb and does not clutter. We could have made bulky external devices, but we opted to leave the design of your beloved environments intact.
ezon.io will be your favorite companion to control and automate all the applications you want like no one did it before. All without having countless devices and apps. Our first rule is to increase your degree of safety and comfort without making it stressful.




Everything is just at your fingertips, ezon.io is quick, easy, and intuitive to use. With the free companion app, you will be able to manage all your devices in a few easy steps. 
When you are away from home, close your shading system and make yourself sure that all your appliances are working as they should, a notification will warn you if something no longer works, preventing possible issues.


ezon.io turns your non-smart devices into smart devices. You never thought that could be possible. Also makes it easy to access any device via a remote or through your preferred voice assistant.


Like us, and all the techies, you're probably always busy, so saving time with the automated features is such a game-changer. Save time on boring tasks and focus on what really matters for you.


The ezon.io devices are suitable for both existing and new installations, only take up a little space, and will never bother you.


You can keep the little ones safe by turning off dangerous appliances that may come into contact with them. At night, don't risk waking up all the family while you come back late from the office, you can configure the lights to turn on in different ways based on time.




Control all the lights via your smartphone and voice or with the ezon.io switches. Don't be blinded by the lights or wake up your loved ones again.


Create a personalized atmosphere that fits your current mood. The illunaluce x ezon.io set of Italian design Smart LED lamps are designed to make your environment modern and elegant while keeping an eye on the environment.




Control a wide range of devices and appliances.ezon.io supports 90/260V AC and  MAX 30V DC appliances. The ezon.io devices allow you to control the consumption of appliances, allowing them to be detached when necessary.


Open and close your roller shutters, curtains, garage door, and barriers or manage any bi-directional motor. With our ezon.io blind manager, it’s now possible to control many applications.




When you come back home open your shutters or curtains and turn on your appliances as TV or radio at the same time without controlling all the appliances individually. There are endless possibilities.


Follow the sunrise and sunset and control your appliances accordingly. Choose a specific time to toggle your scenarios or dim the lights precisely. 




ezon.io user interfaces are designed with the human in mind, not a robot. The ezon.io companion app provides unparalleled control over your environment, it's simple and quick to use and is available for both iOS and Android.
With the ezon.io Remote Button you can quickly recall scenarios or applications with a tap.
The Smart Home features are also available through your preferred voice assistants such as Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.
  




Interconnected Stand-Alone Solution. No point of failure.
All ezon.io devices are equipped with a localized configuration that allows them to work for you without interfacing with any control unit.

All devices can connect to each other using an innovative wireless connection, thus also acting as a signal repeater without necessarily having to work with a wifi access point and wifi repeaters.

 

To take advantage of the voice and remote control services, it's necessary to use a dedicated ezon.io device that provides internet access to the ezon.io devices' internal network.


How ezon.io can save your day from vendor fragmentation: When you buy (you shouldn't, really) a competitor device, usually it's a bunch of fragmented and specific appliances, that don't allow interoperability with all the devices that live with you in your home.
The ezon.io family has been designed to guarantee an infinite range of opportunities with their connected devices.

 
ezon.io Switch and Touch devices are our solutions for migrating your current switches or buttons to a Smart Home device.

These products can read the change of position or pressure on the existing physical command (or in the case of the ezon.io Touch, on a blind plug), and depending on their configuration they can send a command to other ezon.io devices set up for the reception. 
The device can be configured to have multiple functions such as controlling the ezon.io relays (that can be used for light fixtures/sockets, etc ..), and even groups of them, and to recall back customized scenarios and automation.As all the ezon.io devices, ezon.io Switch and ezon.io Touch are fully configurable also with a date and time schedule, for example, you can decide that a specific ezon.io device could act differently on Monday from 9 AM to 10 PM. 
 
ezon.io Switch Relay and Touch Relay devices are our solutions for migrating your current switches or buttons to a Smart Home device, but they also integrate a configurable relay.By combining the features of ezon.io Switch/Touch and ezon.io Relay, they are the right choice if you have a simple light application. With additionals ezon.io Switches you can add several points of control for your lighting application.


ezon.io Relay is our device to control and automate unlimited applications in your favorite Personal Spaces.

The ezon.io relay is capable to disconnect or restore the power supply to an electrical socket, open and close a door,  turn on and off a light fixture, control your sprinkler system, and much much more.It can be used at your will in combination with the ezon.io family devices such as Switches, Touch, Remotes, Sensors to match every need.It also performs customized scenarios and automation.



 





ezon.io Energy Manager device keeps track of your consumption and avoids annoying electrical disconnections due to excessive demand.ezon.io Energy Manager integrates a lot of cool functions and tech, but it's still simple to operate, like all the ezon.io ecosystem. It communicates instantaneous absorption data and consumption statistics, that can be used for statistical use or, combined with others ezon.io Energy Managers can manage the disconnections of the sockets according to the configured priority through its built-in relays.



 

ezon.io Blind Manager device control and automate your shading system as rolling shutters and electrical blinds.
The ezon.io  Blind Manager allows the setting of your shading systems on different positions and different heights according to your needs.
The versatility of individually controlling each shade allows you to build customized scenarios based on your needs and ambiance conditions. This guarantees extreme flexibility and energy savings (up to 44% on your current bill).





Control your home remotely or via your voice whilst adding a personal touch to your ambiance with ezon.io Light Hubezon.io Light Hub is a multifunctional device that combines an ambient design RGB LED lamp and cloud-based features such as “ezon.io Worldwide”,  and voice assistant integration for providers like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.

 






 
Control other ezon.io devices such as Illunaluce x ezon.io lamps, relays, and shading systems with the Light Sensor. The ezon.io Light Sensor can determine the level of light present in an environment. Like the ezon.io Switch is fully configurable so, for example, you can decide to dim an Illunaluce x ezon.io LED light fixture to keep a specific level of light in your work environment. It comes with a built-in rechargeable battery included.

</h3>
<h3></h3>
<p>Sometimes
people fall on hard times and they have nowhere left to go. 
According to the publication “Estimating
the Need,” (PIT Report), it is projected that over the course of
this year, <i><b>25,612 adults and
children </b></i><i><b>will be</b></i><i><b>
experiencing homelessness in the State of New Jersey.</b></i>
 Many of
these people turn to homeless shelters
to find a
place to live temporarily.  To date, the
availability of beds, or even floor space, in New Jersey's  homeless
shelters falls short of the need by more than 20%.  By this equation,
<i><b>more than 5,000 men, women and
children will not have a place to sleep on any given night in New
Jersey.</b></i></p>
<p>James
Damico, President and Founder of Tommys House will gladly tell you:
“If you are like me, you cannot turn away from seeing the pain,
your heart breaks, you reach into your pocket for 10 or 20 dollars to
give, but you know that the cash is not going to keep them warm or

<p>Tommys
House is breaking ground on building a new temporary housing facility
from an existing structure in Passaic County.  The facility will
offer temporary emergency housing for homeless men and women in
Passaic and neighboring Bergen Counties.  With the opening of this
much needed shelter, Tommys House will provide to those who are
in need, a warm bed, and access to a hearty meal, clean showers,
clothing and a safe environment where they can rest their heads for
the night.
</p>
<p>Tommys
House will also assist with referral services, to help set up
treatment and/or follow up care. We have access to both state funded
and private institutions in the mental health, substance abuse, and
medical fields. Along with referral to treatment facilities we also
help with referring to housing, social services, food services, and
the basic necessities for short-term stabilization back into society.
Here at Tommy’s House we are the helping hand to pick up those who
need help, back onto their feet.</p>

At
Tommys House, we value each and every person as a fellow human, and
will empower the homeless to build a positive future by
providing the resources and assistance critical to growth and
stability in society.

<p>The
name of each donor will be included on a Wall of Thanks in the

people have given in support of them.  This is a critical step in
their progress toward self-sufficiency, and to feeling a connection
to the community they live in.

Sometimes
people fall on hard times and they have nowhere left to go. 
According to the publication “Estimating
the Need,” (PIT Report), it is projected that over the course of
this year, 25,612 adults and
children will be
experiencing homelessness in the State of New Jersey.
 Many of
these people turn to homeless shelters
to find a
place to live temporarily.  To date, the
availability of beds, or even floor space, in New Jersey's  homeless
shelters falls short of the need by more than 20%.  By this equation,
more than 5,000 men, women and
children will not have a place to sleep on any given night in New
Jersey.
James
Damico, President and Founder of Tommys House will gladly tell you:
“If you are like me, you cannot turn away from seeing the pain,
your heart breaks, you reach into your pocket for 10 or 20 dollars to
give, but you know that the cash is not going to keep them warm or
safe.  Instead, support Tommys House to put your heartfelt gift into
action and provide that safe and warm place for these less fortunate
people to rest their heads.  I see the commercials for helping
animals, and thank goodness they have shelters for animals, but what
about our fellow man?”

<p>Let’s face it, everyone dreads installing traditional curtain brackets as it requires 15 minutes or more to measure for correct height and width for just one window.  Additionally, traditional curtain brackets require screws, wall anchors, and major tools for installation and once removed, large holes are left behind.  There are products on the market intended to bypass this method of installation, but they also have the following limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some still requires measuring for height and width. </li>
<li>Some can only be installed on windows with window trim, while others can only be installed on windows without window trim.</li>
<li>Some cannot be installed on windows with existing blinds.</li>
<li>Once removed, products with adhesive backing tends to remove paint from the wall surface.</li>
<li>Even after installation, some products will still allow sunlight to pass through the sides and top of curtains.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> <a href=""http://tinypic.com?ref=i5vmde"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Image and video hosting by TinyPic"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i68.tinypic.com/i5vmde.jpg"" src=""""/></a></p>
<p>The patent pending Speedy Hang curtain brackets  (main bracket shown below) provides solution to these problems by using position tools and two small diameter finishing nails.  Using the same method as picture hangers, the finishing nails are inserted through the bracket mounts at an angle.  This, along with the lower mount section and support leg allows each bracket to extend approximately 3 1/2 inches (88.9 mm) from the wall surface.  Also, each curtain bracket is capable of supporting up to 5 lbs (2.27 kg) of weight.</p>

<u><strong>Time</strong></u>: Each bracket installs in less than one minute.</li>
<li>Requires no measuring for height and width.</li>
<li>Hassle free installation and uninstalling.  </li>
<li>Requires no major tools.</li>
<li>Requires no screws or wall anchors.</li>
<li>No large holes left behind.</li>
<li>No need to nail into a wall stud.</li>
<li>Installs on windows with or without window trim.</li>
<li>Installs on windows with existing blinds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just imagine installing two Speedy Hang curtain brackets in a fraction of the time it would take to correctly install two traditional brackets.  This is how simple it is to install our brackets!</p>

<p>During my 23 years in the United States Air Force, I was required to move to a different duty location every 3 to 4 years.  Because of this, I have never desired to own a home. I didn’t want to deal with the nightmare of renting my place out or selling my home in fear of losing money, once I've moved.  So, I choose to rent instead. But, when it came to hanging window treatment, I always ran into the same problem.  I was always told from the apartment manager/landlord (written or verbally) that tenants were not permitted to drill holes in the walls to hang curtains or would face stiff penalties.  Most apartments would have blinds installed which was perfect for privacy, but would still allow sunlight to shine through.  I have tried other curtain hanging products, but they would either still let sunlight pass through the sides or the product did not provide a professional look. </p>
<p>After I've moved into my current apartment, I had a discussion with the apartment manager about hanging window treatment.  She informed me that holes can be no larger than the size of picture hanger nails (finishing nails), then she opened her desk drawer and pulled out a couple to show me the size of the nails.  This is when the idea came to develop curtain brackets that could be supported by these small nails.  The timeline below outlines Speedy Hang bracket history:</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p> We are Robert and Ronald Burdette, the owners of 2RLB Enterprise, LLC and inventors of Speedy Hang curtain brackets. Two years ago, we had a goal to change the way people install curtain brackets.  We have worked long and hard developing and revising our prototypes to ensure they can be installed in seconds while at the same time, causing minimal damage to the wall surface all while achieving a professional look.</p>
<p>Currently, our brackets are produced using a 3D printer and we would like to move to the next phase by bringing our products to market.  This requires us to employ an injection molding company to produce the molds plus other start-up costs.  As you may or may not know, the initial cost of the injection molds are not cheap and this is where we could use your help. </p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $25,000 to assist with initial production costs.  Profits from the sale of the Speedy Hang Curtain Brackets will go towards manufacturing, overhead, marketing/advertising, taxes, profits, and also assist in bringing other amazing products to market.</p>
<p>In appreciation for your support, we have listed several perks which will give you first hand on the products and initial production discounted prices. </p>

<p>Risks and Challenges are very low – We have been personally testing our prototypes since August 2016 and we have not experienced any problems.  Furthermore, once we’ve file for our provisional patents, we’ve shared products with selected family, friends and co-worker for real-world testing and received positive feedback.</p>

<p><strong>Can I claim multiple perks?</strong><br/>Sure you can and thanks for your support!</p>
<p><strong>Will the brackets support more than 5 lbs?</strong></p>
<p>Currently, our brackets are produced by a 3d printer using Polylactide (PLA) filament.  Through our very own testing and evaluations, we have determined the maximum weight of 5 lbs each.  Once the brackets are produced using the injection mold process, we will re-evaluate and adjust the maximum weight accordingly.  2RLB Enterprises, LLC will not be responsible for any misuse of our products.</p>
<p><strong>I would like to hang my curtains higher than the height the positioning tool offers and the window is also extended length.  How would you suggest I hang the curtains?  </strong></p>
<p>This is simple!  Since you are not using the positioning tool, you will need to measure for correct height and width.  Then, you would use a main curtain bracket instead of a center bracket which could be obtained by purchasing the two main curtain bracket perk. </p>
<p><strong>What colors are available? </strong><br/>For our initial campaign production start-up, we will offer the brackets in silver with the possibility of other colors later in the campaign.  </p>
<p><strong>Does the Speedy Hang Curtain Bracket System come with a warranty?</strong><br/>Yes, our product will come with a 1 year warranty. </p>
<p><strong>What happens if the project gets pushed back past the delivery date?</strong><br/>While we will do our best to deliver on the estimated time frame, we also want to make sure we produce a quality product that you are extremely satisfied with. There may be certain delays beyond our control which may delay the project. However, we will always be transparent and keep you all up to date.</p>
<p><strong>Can I get a refund after the campaign has ended?</strong><br/>The money raised here on Indiegogo will go into product development, purchasing of materials, and manufacturing to deliver the Speedy Hang Curtain Bracket System to your home.  Refunds will only be issued if we cannot deliver the final product after exploring all possible options. We will do our best to be transparent and keep you updated on all developments.</p>
<p><strong>Can you ship outside of the United States?</strong><br/>For our initial campaign production start-up, we are limited to shipping to the 48 contiguous states with the possibility of shipping to the other US territories and other countries in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>Will the Speedy Hang Curtain Bracket System vary from the prototypes listed above? </strong><br/>We have spent two years researching and developing our prototypes using computer-aided design software.  If any revisions are required by the injection mold company, they will be minor.</p>

</div></div>","Let’s face it, everyone dreads installing traditional curtain brackets as it requires 15 minutes or more to measure for correct height and width for just one window.  Additionally, traditional curtain brackets require screws, wall anchors, and major tools for installation and once removed, large holes are left behind.  There are products on the market intended to bypass this method of installation, but they also have the following limitations:

Some still requires measuring for height and width. 
Some can only be installed on windows with window trim, while others can only be installed on windows without window trim.
Some cannot be installed on windows with existing blinds.
Once removed, products with adhesive backing tends to remove paint from the wall surface.
Even after installation, some products will still allow sunlight to pass through the sides and top of curtains.

 
The patent pending Speedy Hang curtain brackets  (main bracket shown below) provides solution to these problems by using position tools and two small diameter finishing nails.  Using the same method as picture hangers, the finishing nails are inserted through the bracket mounts at an angle.  This, along with the lower mount section and support leg allows each bracket to extend approximately 3 1/2 inches (88.9 mm) from the wall surface.  Also, each curtain bracket is capable of supporting up to 5 lbs (2.27 kg) of weight.
 

 



Time: Each bracket installs in less than one minute.
Requires no measuring for height and width.
Hassle free installation and uninstalling.  
Requires no major tools.
Requires no screws or wall anchors.
No large holes left behind.
No need to nail into a wall stud.
Installs on windows with or without window trim.
Installs on windows with existing blinds.

Just imagine installing two Speedy Hang curtain brackets in a fraction of the time it would take to correctly install two traditional brackets.  This is how simple it is to install our brackets!

 

 
 

The main curtain bracket is designed for installing on the left and right sides of the window trim or window frame.  Once installed, the center of curtain rod will be placed approximately 3 1/2 inches (88.9 mm) above the window trim or window frame.



 
 

The positioning tools were developed to simplify the installation of the main curtain bracket.  These tools are reversible which will allow the customer to effortlessly install the main curtain brackets on the left and right sides of the window. 
Note:  It is not mandatory to use the positioning tools when installing the main curtain brackets, but if not used, you will be required to measure for correct height and width.

 

This positioning tool is designed to install the main curtain bracket on windows with window trim.  Once installed, the brackets will be placed approximately 2 inches (50.9 mm) on each side of the window trim and approximately 3 ½ inches  (88.9 mm) above the window trim. 
Have existing blinds installed above your window frame?   Simply use this tool in the same matter as you would to install on windows with trim.  Once installed,  the center of the brackets will be placed approximately 2 inches (50.8 mm) from the left and right sides of the blind frame.
 

 

 
 


 


 

This positioning tool is designed to install the main curtain bracket on windows without window trim.  Once installed, the brackets will be placed approximately 4 inches (101.6 mm) on each side of the window frame and approximately 3 ½ inches (88.9 mm) above the window frame.  The positioning tool can also be used with windows that have blinds installed in the window frame. (Note: blinds must be recessed into window frame at least 1/4 inch (6.35 mm).  
 

 


 


 


 

Have extended length windows or windows that are in close proximity to a corner?  No Problem! Speedy Hang center curtain brackets installs just as simple and also works with the main curtain brackets.

 

This center curtain bracket is designed for extended length windows with window trim or windows that are within close proximity to a corner.  Once installed, the center of curtain rod will be place approximately 3 1/2 inches (88.9 mm) above the window trim.

<div>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">I've had a couple of people who have pointed out that this is a ""big ask,"" and so I want to address that here. Yes, $160,000 is a fair chunk of change. We've set that goal because the land we want to buy is $150,000, and we need to also be able to cover the costs of the campaign itself (fulfillment of Perks and the percentage Indiegogo takes.) That said, however, I want to emphasize a couple of very important points:</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><b>1. This campaign is about buying a specific lot that is currently available and ideal for what we want to do. We have other funding that will be coming down the pike later, with a couple of investors already confirmed. However, we're still in negotiations as to the best way to bring one of them on board, and the other won't be ready to invest for at least a couple of months. We also have a couple of other investor pitch opportunities we're pursuing, but these won't happen until late in the fall. The point, then, is that the lot could sell before we finalize these investments. That's why we decided to do crowdfunding NOW. </b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><b>2. Even if we don't raise the whole amount, as long as we can come up with an acceptable down payment, we'll be able to buy the lot by getting a loan for the balance. So obviously, the bigger the down payment, the better off we'll be. Even if all we raise is earnest money, it will get the purchase rolling.</b></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>So, if you've been considering contributing but feel like it would just be a drop in a very large bucket, please know that your contribution WILL make a difference.</b></h3>

<h2>Why laundry?</h2>
<p>Salutations, and thanks for checking out our campaign! </p>
<p>My name is Susan Carpenter Sims, and Beyond Laundry is the passion project I've been wanting to launch for several years. I've been studying green building and sustainable living systems for over a decade, and when I moved to Taos, New Mexico in 2008, I started formulating the idea for <b>a green laundry center</b>. </p>
<p>I'm a single mother of four who's relied on laundromats for most of my adult life, so it didn't take me long after moving here to realize that there was a need for one on the south end of town.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Almost immediately, I began to envision an alternative that involved </span><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">rainwater harvesting and greywater irrigation</b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> of a garden on the premises. And I thought:</span></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Wouldn't it be nice to do your laundry somewhere clean and pleasant and spacious, with a lush greenhouse and a garden outside where you could sit and enjoy yourself while your clothes are washing? </span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">And how cool would it be if there was free WiFi, and, say, a children's play area so that you weren't constantly trying to keep your kids from climbing into laundry carts and running around the place slamming washing machine doors? </span></li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">And for that matter, how about if there was a snack bar selling healthy food, so that they wouldn't beg for candy bars from overpriced vending machines?</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I started writing a business plan and looking for <b>commercial washers &amp; dryers that are highly energy- and water-efficient</b>, and that's how I found our wonderful distributor, Bob Ropp of Sunshine Sales, who will provide us with the high-speed, environmentally-friendly <b>Continental Girbau washers &amp; dryers </b>we'll use. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437237308/uw5xtmvs5uc7yrb42pto.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Back in 2009, Bob actually came all the way to Taos from Arizona, and we looked at possible locations together. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">And then we sat down and talked about how much it would all cost - to get these top-of-the line machines &amp; install them, and to remodel or build a building to handle high energy and water needs, as well as all the many things that go into starting any brick-and-mortar business.</span></p>
<p>At that time in my life, it was more than I could imagine raising; it just seemed impossible. And the truth is, I just wasn't ready. Sadly, I shelved the plan and focused on starting a writing &amp; editing business instead, because I could do that with the very little money I already had.</p>
<h2><b>Fast forward to the present</b></h2>
<p>The last few years of living and running a business in this amazing, entrepreneurial, sustainability-oriented, innovation-encouraging town has grown me a lot. I've gained even more knowledge about green building, rainwater harvesting, and greywater recycling, not to mention how to run a business successfully. And <b>now I have the confidence, experience, and skills to make it happen, not to mention a great team who's 100% behind this plan. We've been working hard to bring the vision to life, and as </b><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">of July 7th, 2015, Beyond Laundry is officially a Limited Liability Company in the state of New Mexico. Woo hooo!!!</b></p>
<p>Yes, <b>the startup costs are higher than average for a small business</b>, but I believe that most people can easily recognize how practical, profitable, and positive this really is. That belief has already been confirmed by countless conversations with all kinds of people who invariably say:  ""What a great idea!"" </p>
<p>And that's why we're running this campaign, because we trust that you, dear reader, will understand the beauty and importance of what we're doing, and will want to be part of it too.</p>
<h2>What your backing will do for this project</h2>
<p>Because we're building from the ground up, and because designing the greywater system is so site-specific, <b>the first thing we need to do is buy land.</b> There's an ideal one-acre lot for sale right now for $150,000, which is a great price for such a large lot with high visibility and easy access on the main road through town, AND it's on the south side of town, exactly where we want and need to be. </p>
<p>As you can see in the video and photo below, there is currently a house trailer on the property that will be moved off, and where it is now is more or less where our building will eventually be. The whole back area of the lot can be for food-producing gardens and even an orchard.</p>
<p><b>Our goal for this Indiegogo campaign is to raise the funds to pay cash for this land</b>, (We've made $160,000 our goal for this campaign so that, after paying for the land, we'll have money left over to cover the Indiegogo costs and those of sending out the perks we're offering to our backers.)  </p>
<p>Buying the land outright will help us leverage further funding we're going to need for construction and equipment, as I explain in this brief video tour of the lot:</p>

</div> <div> <h2><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Environmental &amp; social impacts</span></h2>
</div><div> <p>We're planning to have 22 efficient washing machines and 24 dryers in our Taos location. We estimate that we can harvest about 29,000 gallons of rainwater a year from our roof, but that's only a small fraction of the amount needed for the washers, which we estimate at over a million gallons a year! </p>
<p>However, that million gallons will also turn into valuable greywater after it runs through the washers, and we'll use it to irrigate a greenhouse, a community food garden, and an orchard.</p>
<p>And, even after all that, there will still be so much greywater left over that we'll purify and recycle it to reuse in the washers, meaning that we can bring our reliance on the town's water supply to basically nothing. </p>
<p>We're also going to use solar for as much of our power source as we can, and will be seeking funding for this through the USDA Rural Energy for America Program, which helps small businesses in rural areas incorporate renewable energies at a very low cost.</p>
<p>That means we will have the following impacts:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><b>saving many thousands of gallons of precious water a year </b></li>
<li><b>producing healthy food for our community</b></li>
<li><b>significantly reducing our carbon footprint </b></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Demolishing the paradigm of the ""laundromat,"" baby!</b></h2>
<ul>
</ul>Because, really, <b>what this is about is creating a living community center</b> - a place where people can hang out, connect with each other, and learn about sustainability. </div><div>

</div><div>We'll have a multi-purpose room that can be used for community groups to meet and hold <b>sustainability workshops</b>. We'll have <b>special events</b> - some just for fun and some for sustainability education. </div><div>The multi-purpose room will also have a corner in it for kids to hang out, when it's not being used for meetings. There will be toys, books, and movies available to keep kids happy while their parents do laundry.</div><div>Another thing that will make this so much more than a laundromat is the attached greenhouse, which will also have cafe-style tables and chairs in it where people can hang out and enjoy snacks from the in-house snack bar offered by Taos' very popular Wired? Cafe. </div><div>
<h3>
<b>But let's not forget about the laundry itself!</b> </h3>
<p>Besides offering self-service laundry, we're also going to have a <b>wash &amp; fold service with optional pickup and delivery</b>, allowing people who lack time and/or transportation to get their laundry done in a way they can feel good about.</p>
<p>We're going to operate the machines on a <b>token system instead of quarters</b>, and tokens will be available for sale at the counter as well as from a change machine. What this means is that customers can use debit or credit cards if they don't have cash. </p>

<h1>And the picture gets even bigger</h1>
<p>This enterprise has turned into so much more than what I originally envisioned. I have been fortunate to connect with <b>local partners, as well as an international team </b>focused on bringing projects like this to developing countries, where people often have no sanitary way to wash clothes. </p>
<p>When I first started revisiting my business plan back in the spring, it serendipitously came to my attention that a social entrepreneurship class, offered online by Copenhagen Business School on Coursera, was about to start. So I signed right up and am so glad I did, because it's been life-changing in more ways than one. For one thing, that's how I connected with my global partners, Arun and Santi (who you can read about below).</p>
<p>Working with this course and the team formed from it opened up new horizons for the plan. The result is that our long term goals include opening multiple community laundry centers in the US, and using at least <b>10% of our profits to work with NGOs</b> that address water issues in developing countries. In this way, we can <b>partner to create sustainable, healthy laundry systems around the world</b>. Pretty incredible, right?</p>

</div></div>","IMPORTANT UPDATE:

I've had a couple of people who have pointed out that this is a ""big ask,"" and so I want to address that here. Yes, $160,000 is a fair chunk of change. We've set that goal because the land we want to buy is $150,000, and we need to also be able to cover the costs of the campaign itself (fulfillment of Perks and the percentage Indiegogo takes.) That said, however, I want to emphasize a couple of very important points:
1. This campaign is about buying a specific lot that is currently available and ideal for what we want to do. We have other funding that will be coming down the pike later, with a couple of investors already confirmed. However, we're still in negotiations as to the best way to bring one of them on board, and the other won't be ready to invest for at least a couple of months. We also have a couple of other investor pitch opportunities we're pursuing, but these won't happen until late in the fall. The point, then, is that the lot could sell before we finalize these investments. That's why we decided to do crowdfunding NOW. 
2. Even if we don't raise the whole amount, as long as we can come up with an acceptable down payment, we'll be able to buy the lot by getting a loan for the balance. So obviously, the bigger the down payment, the better off we'll be. Even if all we raise is earnest money, it will get the purchase rolling.
So, if you've been considering contributing but feel like it would just be a drop in a very large bucket, please know that your contribution WILL make a difference.
And now, back to the campaign . . .

Why laundry?
Salutations, and thanks for checking out our campaign! 
My name is Susan Carpenter Sims, and Beyond Laundry is the passion project I've been wanting to launch for several years. I've been studying green building and sustainable living systems for over a decade, and when I moved to Taos, New Mexico in 2008, I started formulating the idea for a green laundry center. 
I'm a single mother of four who's relied on laundromats for most of my adult life, so it didn't take me long after moving here to realize that there was a need for one on the south end of town.
Almost immediately, I began to envision an alternative that involved rainwater harvesting and greywater irrigation of a garden on the premises. And I thought:


Wouldn't it be nice to do your laundry somewhere clean and pleasant and spacious, with a lush greenhouse and a garden outside where you could sit and enjoy yourself while your clothes are washing? 
And how cool would it be if there was free WiFi, and, say, a children's play area so that you weren't constantly trying to keep your kids from climbing into laundry carts and running around the place slamming washing machine doors? 

And for that matter, how about if there was a snack bar selling healthy food, so that they wouldn't beg for candy bars from overpriced vending machines?


I started writing a business plan and looking for commercial washers & dryers that are highly energy- and water-efficient, and that's how I found our wonderful distributor, Bob Ropp of Sunshine Sales, who will provide us with the high-speed, environmentally-friendly Continental Girbau washers & dryers we'll use. 


Back in 2009, Bob actually came all the way to Taos from Arizona, and we looked at possible locations together. And then we sat down and talked about how much it would all cost - to get these top-of-the line machines & install them, and to remodel or build a building to handle high energy and water needs, as well as all the many things that go into starting any brick-and-mortar business.
At that time in my life, it was more than I could imagine raising; it just seemed impossible. And the truth is, I just wasn't ready. Sadly, I shelved the plan and focused on starting a writing & editing business instead, because I could do that with the very little money I already had.
Fast forward to the present
The last few years of living and running a business in this amazing, entrepreneurial, sustainability-oriented, innovation-encouraging town has grown me a lot. I've gained even more knowledge about green building, rainwater harvesting, and greywater recycling, not to mention how to run a business successfully. And now I have the confidence, experience, and skills to make it happen, not to mention a great team who's 100% behind this plan. We've been working hard to bring the vision to life, and as of July 7th, 2015, Beyond Laundry is officially a Limited Liability Company in the state of New Mexico. Woo hooo!!!
Yes, the startup costs are higher than average for a small business, but I believe that most people can easily recognize how practical, profitable, and positive this really is. That belief has already been confirmed by countless conversations with all kinds of people who invariably say:  ""What a great idea!"" 
And that's why we're running this campaign, because we trust that you, dear reader, will understand the beauty and importance of what we're doing, and will want to be part of it too.
What your backing will do for this project
Because we're building from the ground up, and because designing the greywater system is so site-specific, the first thing we need to do is buy land. There's an ideal one-acre lot for sale right now for $150,000, which is a great price for such a large lot with high visibility and easy access on the main road through town, AND it's on the south side of town, exactly where we want and need to be. 
As you can see in the video and photo below, there is currently a house trailer on the property that will be moved off, and where it is now is more or less where our building will eventually be. The whole back area of the lot can be for food-producing gardens and even an orchard.
Our goal for this Indiegogo campaign is to raise the funds to pay cash for this land, (We've made $160,000 our goal for this campaign so that, after paying for the land, we'll have money left over to cover the Indiegogo costs and those of sending out the perks we're offering to our backers.)  
Buying the land outright will help us leverage further funding we're going to need for construction and equipment, as I explain in this brief video tour of the lot:

And, since in the video I forgot to point out the south boundary, here's an aerial view:


Every donation we receive through this campaign will go towards buying the land: If we raise the total amount we'll buy it outright; if we don't, whatever amount we raise will go toward a down payment. 
If (heaven forbid!) the land sells before we can buy it, we'll go to Plan B: find another lot. And the beauty of our plan is that it's flexible, meaning that we can implement it as incrementally as we need to, and scale it to match available funding. The key is to tackle it one component at a time and build on successes as we go, and that starts with the land.
And, if we're so fortunate (and you all are so generous!) that we raise more than the we need for the land, the excess funding will go toward the next step: 
Constructing the building
We're excited to be partnering with Mark Goldman and his Green Construction Technology Program at the University of New Mexico-Taos. He's serving as a consultant to this project and helping us make decisions about the construction process. 
We're planning to utilize steel construction, which is both low-cost and environmentally friendly. The building is planned at 2400 sf, and we already have a preliminary floor plan, which Bob and the awesome guys at Continental Girbau put together based on my hand-drawn sketch:

A few minor changes are being made to this design, (and we'll be attaching a greenhouse to the south side) but for the most part, it gives a pretty accurate depiction of what the inside of Beyond Laundry will be like.
How we'll say, ""Thank You""
We have some cool goodies in store for you when you when you back us (besides the satisfaction that comes from knowing that you're a part of an innovative and replicable way to increase the health of the planet). 
For example, our regular-fit T-shirt:


and our bumper sticker (not larger than the T-shirt in real life, of course):

We're also offering some perks in the realm of free laundry service, and some for sponsor benefits, so you can pick the level of backing and the perk that's the best fit for you.
IMPORTANT:  Please do keep in mind that if you select a perk involving laundry service or sponsor benefits that involve recognition in the building itself, we're not going to be able to deliver those as quickly as the other perks. Once we buy the land we still have a building to construct and washers & dryers to install, and that's not going to happen overnight. But we'll continue to update this page and the website as we progress, so as our timeline unfolds, you'll know exactly what's happening as we go along.
  Environmental & social impacts
 We're planning to have 22 efficient washing machines and 24 dryers in our Taos location. We estimate that we can harvest about 29,000 gallons of rainwater a year from our roof, but that's only a small fraction of the amount needed for the washers, which we estimate at over a million gallons a year! 
However, that million gallons will also turn into valuable greywater after it runs through the washers, and we'll use it to irrigate a greenhouse, a community food garden, and an orchard.
And, even after all that, there will still be so much greywater left over that we'll purify and recycle it to reuse in the washers, meaning that we can bring our reliance on the town's water supply to basically nothing. 
We're also going to use solar for as much of our power source as we can, and will be seeking funding for this through the USDA Rural Energy for America Program, which helps small businesses in rural areas incorporate renewable energies at a very low cost.
That means we will have the following impacts:


saving many thousands of gallons of precious water a year 
producing healthy food for our community
significantly reducing our carbon footprint 

Demolishing the paradigm of the ""laundromat,"" baby!

Because, really, what this is about is creating a living community center - a place where people can hang out, connect with each other, and learn about sustainability. 

We'll have a multi-purpose room that can be used for community groups to meet and hold sustainability workshops. We'll have special events - some just for fun and some for sustainability education. The multi-purpose room will also have a corner in it for kids to hang out, when it's not being used for meetings. There will be toys, books, and movies available to keep kids happy while their parents do laundry.Another thing that will make this so much more than a laundromat is the attached greenhouse, which will also have cafe-style tables and chairs in it where people can hang out and enjoy snacks from the in-house snack bar offered by Taos' very popular Wired? Cafe. 

But let's not forget about the laundry itself! 
Besides offering self-service laundry, we're also going to have a wash & fold service with optional pickup and delivery, allowing people who lack time and/or transportation to get their laundry done in a way they can feel good about.
We're going to operate the machines on a token system instead of quarters, and tokens will be available for sale at the counter as well as from a change machine. What this means is that customers can use debit or credit cards if they don't have cash. 


Another benefit to this system is that we'll offer tokens in exchange for volunteer hours in the community garden.
Beyond Laundry is going to be so awesome that 





And the picture gets even bigger
This enterprise has turned into so much more than what I originally envisioned. I have been fortunate to connect with local partners, as well as an international team focused on bringing projects like this to developing countries, where people often have no sanitary way to wash clothes. 
When I first started revisiting my business plan back in the spring, it serendipitously came to my attention that a social entrepreneurship class, offered online by Copenhagen Business School on Coursera, was about to start. So I signed right up and am so glad I did, because it's been life-changing in more ways than one. For one thing, that's how I connected with my global partners, Arun and Santi (who you can read about below).
Working with this course and the team formed from it opened up new horizons for the plan. The result is that our long term goals include opening multiple community laundry centers in the US, and using at least 10% of our profits to work with NGOs that address water issues in developing countries. In this way, we can partner to create sustainable, healthy laundry systems around the world. Pretty incredible, right?
You can read more about our global projects on our website.
Meet the team




Alima Fairchild will be our Community Garden Manager. She has many years of experience organizing and working in community gardens, and with community organization in general. Her most recent work is with the Head Waters Food Security Project based in Mora, New Mexico.



Arun Gopalakrishnan, MBA, lives in Dallas, TX, and will coordinate our franchising process in the US and assist with our global projects. He has over 20 years of industry experience in the retail and energy sectors, with expertise in software testing and business analysis. Arun was born in India, and lived in several cities there. He received his Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering, then came to the United States and obtained his Master’s Degree from UT Dallas.  


Santi Lisana, MBA, lives in Jakarta, Indonesia, and will spearhead a non-profit student laundry center at a university there. Not only will students be able to wash their laundry at the center, but it will also serve as a demonstration site/classroom for students to learn about the green technologies Beyond Laundry uses. It will also be an incubator for students wanting to build a business using these technologies.


JonnaLynn Mandelbaum, PhD, MPH retired to Taos after a long and fruitful career in international and public health, and is serving as an advisor for both our local and global projects.
And me, of course:





Susan Carpenter Sims, MA   I've been an entrepreneur since 1991, when I started my first writing & editing business. I've also co-created and managed 501(c)(3)s and other non-profit organizations, as well as planned and managed a variety of projects and events related to sustainability and other community interests. I've been a college English instructor since 2002, and currently teach at UNM-Taos.  


The challenges before us


Financial
The biggest challenge is cost. If all we were doing is opening a standard laundromat, it would still cost more to start up than an average small business. (Some commercial washing machines cost as much as a car!) Because we're doing everything as sustainably as possible, the costs at the outset are even higher. 
However, using solar power, rainwater harvesting, and greywater recycling also means that our utility bills, normally by far the highest overhead costs for a laundry business, will be drastically lowered. 
Also, as a single mother, I can't boast a high net worth or a hefty nest egg. However, what I do have is a
clear vision, great team, excellent business plan, and heaps of
resourcefulness, commitment, and perseverance. 
We're talking to potential investors to work with us on our next steps after the land purchase, and we already have one confirmed. We feel confident that the environmental and social impacts of our project, as well as the potential for profit and growth, will continue to attract the funding we need as we go along. 
Systems design

Designing what we're calling the ""Rainwash System"": catching rain off our roof; getting it to the washers; then sending some of the greywater out to the greenhouse, garden, and orchard; and running the rest of it through a purification system to make it safe and clean to reuse in the washers - well, that's a bit of a challenge too! 
Luckily, we have many wonderful resources here in Taos to help us. We're currently applying for a grant to get technical assistance for this from one of the national labs in this state, through the New Mexico Small Business Assistance Program. However, even if we don't get that grant, we can still scale down our plans a bit and set up these systems incrementally, as we have the funds. 
We're in it for the long haul!
    Thanks for reading all the way through, and we have just one more little favor to ask
Will you help us get the word out? Whether you're able to donate a little, a lot, or not at all, if you're inspired by what we're doing, please consider sharing this campaign through your social networks. 
Every little bit helps, and we truly value your support. Also, we'd love it if you let us know your thoughts in the comments, or shoot an email to susan@beyondlaundry.org!

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">FAQ</h3>
<p><strong>How does this device differ from traditional antivirus solutions?</strong></p>
<p>While the Smart Home Security Solution shares some functionalities with antivirus programs, it also differs distinctly by being applied at network level, thereby protecting all devices as opposed to being solutions for individual computers etc. In this way the solution is a good supplement to antivirus solutions.</p>
<p><strong>How is my data privacy protected?</strong></p>
<p>The solution will send the webadresses (URL's) to our algorithms to perform the service. BSafe2 can see these URL's but not the actual data being exchanged. BSafe2 does not share these data with any 3rd party or government in a form where individual IP addresses can be identified. BSafe2 complies with the EU Dataprotection directives (GDPR).</p>
<p><strong>Will the solution work in my country?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the solution will work in any country, we will however only provide powerplugs for EU (220 v) or US (110v), and you will have to find an appropriate converter if you reside in another region.</p>
<p><strong>Does the solution slow down my network?</strong></p>
<p>The solution sends every new web request to our servers for verification. The return time for this transaction is typically 10 ms, depending on where you are physically located compared to our server. This is hardly noticaable for humans.</p>

Our engineers have extensive experience in firmware programming and in implementing the communications link to our cloud systems from our previous products; and have a clear vision and understanding of what has to be done.
We therefore feel very confident that we will be able to deliver on our promises, as we have done in the past.
 
Who we are
BSafe2 is a small venture that started back in 2011 because of our outrage. Having seen the content being delivered online to our children, we decided to act. From scratch we built a very sophisticated filtering algorithm to weed out offensive material. 
From the humble beginning of protecting our own children, our product has grown into a unique security solution providing solid basic protection against various form of malware for those people who, like most, are not technically savy.

 
Why we need your help
We want to take our product to the next level. The functionality described above will immensely improve the defences ordinary peoples have against one of the largest emerging threats online: It aims at protecting all new smart home gadgets from intruders.
We have a solid base and we have the ideas, as well as the skills to execute them, but we need to fund the work that needs to be done.

Your funding contribution will provide for down to earth expenses, the 100.000$ will pay for:

Firmware development & testing
Buying serverpower
Testing

Join our efforts and be part of this promising idea!

 

You can support us in many ways!
Buy one of our perks, and be part of our venture and mission.
We appreciate all and any help! If you do not have the funds or a need for the perks, help anyway! Make som noise for us, share the Campaign with people who could benefit. We are thankful for any help you can give, and will send our transcendental love to you for any action or thought in support of the project.

FAQ
How does this device differ from traditional antivirus solutions?
While the Smart Home Security Solution shares some functionalities with antivirus programs, it also differs distinctly by being applied at network level, thereby protecting all devices as opposed to being solutions for individual computers etc. In this way the solution is a good supplement to antivirus solutions.
How is my data privacy protected?
The solution will send the webadresses (URL's) to our algorithms to perform the service. BSafe2 can see these URL's but not the actual data being exchanged. BSafe2 does not share these data with any 3rd party or government in a form where individual IP addresses can be identified. BSafe2 complies with the EU Dataprotection directives (GDPR).
Will the solution work in my country?
Yes, the solution will work in any country, we will however only provide powerplugs for EU (220 v) or US (110v), and you will have to find an appropriate converter if you reside in another region.
Does the solution slow down my network?
The solution sends every new web request to our servers for verification. The return time for this transaction is typically 10 ms, depending on where you are physically located compared to our server. This is hardly noticaable for humans.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

42.9%

LIVING SHELTER: A SMART TYPE OF

PRODUCE A SMALL NUMBER OF *FISHBONE CARPETS FOR PROMOTIONAL REASONS.2. COVER PARTICIPATION FEES FOR MAJOR INTERNATIONAL DESIGN EXHIBITION.3. DEVELOP AND PRODUCE NEW PROTOTYPES OF MORE WOO(L)DEN PATTERNS.& also4. COVER EXPENSES FOR WOO(L)DEN GIFTS & PACKAGING & SHIPPING.5. ATTRIBUTE INDIEGOGO & PAYPAL COMMISSION   WHAT YOU GET / GIFTSMade from the same materials and style, we additionally designed ""woo(l)den gifts"", a whole family of related products of the fishbone carpet, for the bakers who support our project ! These are:- a traditional sheep's bell & a shepherd's crook, as a reminder of the fishbone carpet origin.- a case for leaving your phone while charging.-a pair of slippers. -an iPad & iPad mini case.-a cat house.-a backpack.  CREDITS We would like to thank the following people for their valuable contribution, while making this project.Kostantinos Hatzhiagapoglou, at VIOKETS, for providing us with the felt material, and helping producing the first fishbone prototype.Petros & Vasilis Delitzakis, for manufacturing the wooden parts of the carpet.Mrs Athina, for her help and good company on the making of the woo(l)den gifts.Markos Galonis, for cutting a sample on the cnc machine in his lab.Jertef, for taking all photographs of the fishbone carpet and the woo(l)den gifts.Marika Sunday, for helping designing woo(l)den gifts and their packaging during her internship in our studio,Karolos Gakidis, for helping recording the soundtrack and the voice over of this campaign.Stratos for helping with the camera, while filming ourselves in our studio.Miou, our cat, for treating fishbone carpet in her own very style, which helped us understand the felt's properties and weakness points. Video direction, filming and editing by 157+173 designers.Original soundtrack  by 157+173designers.Additional soundtrack by Babis Papadopoulos.  THANKS !Big thanks to everyone who supports this project.Even if you cannot back it, you can still help by sharing it on social media and help it grow large !All  the names of all who backed our project, will be posted on our social media, to let the world know that you helped this project come to life !Spread the word ! babis & christina157+173 designers",32.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Siamo Moli-sani animati dalla voglia di far scoprire la nostra Regione
promuovendo le produzioni locali, incoraggiando un turismo consapevole e creando
connessioni con tutte quelle persone che hanno voglia di conoscere e condividere. </p><p>Vogliamo portare il Molise a casa vostra e Voi a casa nostra, se vorrete.

					</p><div>
<div>
<p>La nostra favola è ambientata in uno dei luoghi più affascinanti d’Italia, poco conosciuto e poco industrializzato, caratterizzato da tradizioni vive e
autentiche. E’ il posto che conosciamo meglio perché è dove siamo nati e cresciuti.

					</p>
<p>Vogliamo condividere con Voi il nostro Tesoro: questa piccola regione, fatta di
castelli, chiese, opere d’arte, borghi unici, paesaggi mozzafiato e persone autentiche.
La nostra idea è di racchiuderne la parte migliore in un box, che parla anch’esso del
Molise, e spedirlo a casa vostra per farvi conoscere ed assaporare quello che vi
aspetta. Il viaggio in Molise che abbiamo pensato per Voi sarà più che autentico:
alla scoperta di tesori nascosti, bellezze uniche e sapori inconfondibili; inoltre vi
guideremo con laboratori alla scoperta della cucina tradizionale e gusti locali.</p>
<p>
Il Vostro contributo è fondamentale ed il nostro impatto sul territorio sarà forte
perché incoraggiamo produzioni locali e rispettose del territorio, ecoturismo per un
viaggio consapevole e sostenibile; vi invitiamo inoltre ad invitarci i vostri ricordi
perché vogliamo costruire un archivio per preservare questo immenso patrimonio per
le generazioni future. Raccontarci anche la vostra storia, perché siamo curiosi e
vogliamo creare connessioni vere e sincere (connections@moliseinabox.it). <br/></p>

<p><b>La campagna di crowdfunding
</b></p>
<p>L’obiettivo della campagna di crowdfunding è la cifra di 10.000 euro. Il 50% di
questa cifra è direttamente destinato alle aziende con le quali collaboriamo, quindi
un’impronta diretta sull’economia locale. La rimanente parte sarà destinata
all’avvio della società, alle spese di stampa dei pacchi ed alle spese generali e
logistiche. Se la nostra campagna raggiungerà 30.000 € contiamo di aprire un
punto di accoglienza turistica permanente, lungo il tratturo Lucera-Castel di
Sangro, e spazio di co-working dove svolgere le nostre attività.
</p>
<p>Le ricompense che abbiamo previsto sono assolutamente uniche; i prodotti
provengono da piccole aziende locali che potrete visitare quando verrete a trovarci. <br/></p>

da laboratori di cucina dove scoprirete la vera tradizione molisana.
</p>
<p>Se non riusciremo a raggiungere l’obiettivo prefissato potremo comunque assicurare
le nostre ricompense ma in tal caso il margine non sarà tale da permetterci di
sviluppare la nostra attività.
</p>
<p><b>Il nostro impatto sul territorio
</b></p>
<p>Aiutiamo le aziende locali a crescere ed è per questo che il vostro contributo farà la
differenza. Inoltre visitare il Molise fornirà ulteriori benefici all’economia locale. In
ultimo le connessioni che vogliamo creare ci aiuteranno a custodire un grande
archivio dei ricordi che consegneremo alle generazioni future.
</p>
<p><b>La nostra sfida
</b></p>
<p>I rischi sono insiti in ogni attività ed abbiamo lo spirito giusto per affrontarli al
meglio. Con il progredire della campagna contiamo di aggiungere nuove persone e
nuove competenze al nostro team; ci prepariamo per affrontare le sfide che si
presentano all’orizzonte con il massimo delle nostre forze. Il vostro supporto farà la
differenza e vi ringraziamo per questo.
</p>
<p>Vi invitiamo a sostenerci anche solamente condividendo questa campagna con amici
e parenti; grazie a voi riusciremo a creare un qualcosa di autentico ed unico.

enthusiastic friends from Molise with a deep love for our Region and a passion
for all the treasures it has to offer. </p><p>We aim to promote
local economy and to encourage environmentally friendly tourism, creating
connections among all those people who, like us, are willing to discover and
share.</p><p>
</p><p></p><p>We would love to
bring a bit of Molise into your home – and to bring you into ours!</p><p>
</p><p></p><p>Our story is set
in one of the most charming spots of Italy, maybe less well-known and not very
industrialized but kept alive by authentic and passionate traditions. </p><p>
</p><p></p><p>This is the place
we know better than anywhere else, the place we call home.</p><p>
</p><p></p><p>Now we want to share this gem with you: a
small region with a big heart, filled with ancient castles and beautiful
churches, artistic masterpieces and breathtaking landscapes, unique hamlets and
genuine people. </p><p>
</p><p></p><p>Our idea is to
enclose the best of our region in a box and send it to you, giving you a hint
of what you could taste and feel in Molise.</p><p>
</p><p></p><p>The journey we
plan for you will then be a truly authentic experience that you'll carry
forever in your heart: you will explore a unique land, discover its treasures
and beauty, accompanied by the most intense flavours of our traditional cuisine
thanks to dedicated workshops.</p><p>
</p><p></p><p>Your contribution
is essential to help us make a difference for our region. <br/>
We support local businesses operating with low impact on the territory and we
promote ecotourism as a sustainable and conscious action in favour of the environment.</p><p>
</p><p></p><p>We are all about
contact and sharing, so please send us your memories if you know our Region; we
will build an archive to keep these memories alive through time, and to
preserve them for the new generations.</p><p>
</p><p></p><p>Share your
memories with us, but also your story: we'd love to get to know you, your home
and your corner of the world! Let's build true and honest connections,
together. (<a href=""mailto:connections@moliseinabox.it"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">connections@moliseinabox.it</a>). </p><p>
</p><p></p><p>Our crowdfunding campaign</p><p>
</p><p></p><p>Our goal is to
collect 10.000 €. </p><p>
</p><p></p><p>We will leave a
positive footprint on the community as 50% of this amount is destined for local
businesses that are supplying us with their products. Another percentage will
be invested in marketing and promotional material, and the remaining amount is
to cover general logistic expenses. This will allow us to start our own
business.</p><p>
</p><p></p><p>If we manage to
reach 30.000 € we will open a tourist information point in our village,
Castropignano, along with a co-working space where we could carry out our

Siamo Moli-sani animati dalla voglia di far scoprire la nostra Regione
promuovendo le produzioni locali, incoraggiando un turismo consapevole e creando
connessioni con tutte quelle persone che hanno voglia di conoscere e condividere. Vogliamo portare il Molise a casa vostra e Voi a casa nostra, se vorrete.

					

La nostra favola è ambientata in uno dei luoghi più affascinanti d’Italia, poco conosciuto e poco industrializzato, caratterizzato da tradizioni vive e
autentiche. E’ il posto che conosciamo meglio perché è dove siamo nati e cresciuti.

					
Vogliamo condividere con Voi il nostro Tesoro: questa piccola regione, fatta di
castelli, chiese, opere d’arte, borghi unici, paesaggi mozzafiato e persone autentiche.
La nostra idea è di racchiuderne la parte migliore in un box, che parla anch’esso del
Molise, e spedirlo a casa vostra per farvi conoscere ed assaporare quello che vi
aspetta. Il viaggio in Molise che abbiamo pensato per Voi sarà più che autentico:
alla scoperta di tesori nascosti, bellezze uniche e sapori inconfondibili; inoltre vi
guideremo con laboratori alla scoperta della cucina tradizionale e gusti locali.

Il Vostro contributo è fondamentale ed il nostro impatto sul territorio sarà forte
perché incoraggiamo produzioni locali e rispettose del territorio, ecoturismo per un
viaggio consapevole e sostenibile; vi invitiamo inoltre ad invitarci i vostri ricordi
perché vogliamo costruire un archivio per preservare questo immenso patrimonio per
le generazioni future. Raccontarci anche la vostra storia, perché siamo curiosi e
vogliamo creare connessioni vere e sincere (connections@moliseinabox.it). 







La campagna di crowdfunding

L’obiettivo della campagna di crowdfunding è la cifra di 10.000 euro. Il 50% di
questa cifra è direttamente destinato alle aziende con le quali collaboriamo, quindi
un’impronta diretta sull’economia locale. La rimanente parte sarà destinata
all’avvio della società, alle spese di stampa dei pacchi ed alle spese generali e
logistiche. Se la nostra campagna raggiungerà 30.000 € contiamo di aprire un
punto di accoglienza turistica permanente, lungo il tratturo Lucera-Castel di
Sangro, e spazio di co-working dove svolgere le nostre attività.

Le ricompense che abbiamo previsto sono assolutamente uniche; i prodotti
provengono da piccole aziende locali che potrete visitare quando verrete a trovarci.

(dolce tipico da Torella del Sannio con farina di mais, 750gr)Il
viaggio in Molise (http://www.moliseinabox.it/molise-tours/) è altrettanto autentico a partire dalla colazione, a casa nostra, e
da laboratori di cucina dove scoprirete la vera tradizione molisana.

Se non riusciremo a raggiungere l’obiettivo prefissato potremo comunque assicurare
le nostre ricompense ma in tal caso il margine non sarà tale da permetterci di
sviluppare la nostra attività.

Il nostro impatto sul territorio

Aiutiamo le aziende locali a crescere ed è per questo che il vostro contributo farà la
differenza. Inoltre visitare il Molise fornirà ulteriori benefici all’economia locale. In
ultimo le connessioni che vogliamo creare ci aiuteranno a custodire un grande
archivio dei ricordi che consegneremo alle generazioni future.

La nostra sfida

I rischi sono insiti in ogni attività ed abbiamo lo spirito giusto per affrontarli al
meglio. Con il progredire della campagna contiamo di aggiungere nuove persone e
nuove competenze al nostro team; ci prepariamo per affrontare le sfide che si
presentano all’orizzonte con il massimo delle nostre forze. Il vostro supporto farà la
differenza e vi ringraziamo per questo.

Vi invitiamo a sostenerci anche solamente condividendo questa campagna con amici
e parenti; grazie a voi riusciremo a creare un qualcosa di autentico ed unico.




Permetteteci di concludere dicendo che siamo orgogliosi della nostra Regione, della
nostra terra, e faremo di tutto per proteggerla e per farvi innamorare, venire a
conoscerla o farvi ritorno.
La nostra è una rete di piccoli produttori, villaggi minuscoli e persone autentiche.
Veniamo dalla terra, la rispettiamo, siamo orgogliosi della nostra storia; apriamo a
voi le nostre case, vi guidiamo alla scoperta di sapori dimenticati e posti incantati.
Grazie!

English versionWe are a group of
enthusiastic friends from Molise with a deep love for our Region and a passion
for all the treasures it has to offer. We aim to promote
local economy and to encourage environmentally friendly tourism, creating
connections among all those people who, like us, are willing to discover and
share.
We would love to
bring a bit of Molise into your home – and to bring you into ours!
Our story is set
in one of the most charming spots of Italy, maybe less well-known and not very
industrialized but kept alive by authentic and passionate traditions. 
This is the place
we know better than anywhere else, the place we call home.
Now we want to share this gem with you: a
small region with a big heart, filled with ancient castles and beautiful
churches, artistic masterpieces and breathtaking landscapes, unique hamlets and
genuine people. 
Our idea is to
enclose the best of our region in a box and send it to you, giving you a hint
of what you could taste and feel in Molise.
The journey we
plan for you will then be a truly authentic experience that you'll carry
forever in your heart: you will explore a unique land, discover its treasures
and beauty, accompanied by the most intense flavours of our traditional cuisine
thanks to dedicated workshops.
Your contribution
is essential to help us make a difference for our region. 
We support local businesses operating with low impact on the territory and we
promote ecotourism as a sustainable and conscious action in favour of the environment.
We are all about
contact and sharing, so please send us your memories if you know our Region; we
will build an archive to keep these memories alive through time, and to
preserve them for the new generations.
Share your
memories with us, but also your story: we'd love to get to know you, your home
and your corner of the world! Let's build true and honest connections,
together. (connections@moliseinabox.it). 
Our crowdfunding campaign
Our goal is to
collect 10.000 €. 
We will leave a
positive footprint on the community as 50% of this amount is destined for local
businesses that are supplying us with their products. Another percentage will
be invested in marketing and promotional material, and the remaining amount is
to cover general logistic expenses. This will allow us to start our own
business.
If we manage to
reach 30.000 € we will open a tourist information point in our village,
Castropignano, along with a co-working space where we could carry out our
activities, for example a cooking school.
The rewards for
you will be truly unique: all the products are from small local businesses that
you'll be able to visit on your journey here.Contado del Molise: Semola rimacinata (1 Kg, ideal for hanmade pasta - perhaps we will send the recipe), Organic ""spaghettata"" (dried erbs),

We are transparent about the fact that our products are Made in China and we are proud to have the necessary facilities to do all our own assembly, packing and custom engraving on-site in our 1300 square feet studio. We have shipped products to over 100+ countries worldwide and have worked with major corporate clients including Disney, Dior and The Grammys.

 
Why INDIEGOGO?
We launched the ALUMA on Kickstarter 6 months ago and had always intended to launch a follow-up campaign. However, having received such an overwhelming amount of support we decided to hang back until we had successfully fulfilled the Kickstarter rewards. Now that we are ready to start offering pre-orders we are launching an exclusive campaign here on INDIEGOGO for anybody who wishes to get their hands on the ALUMA before they go to retail.

<h3>The Gist</h3>
<p>Clayton InterGalactic in an IT Infrastructure Startup where we are building long-term solutions to change how data is collected, protected and sold. We are a growing community of experts in our fields who understand the value we bring and respect and appreciate the value others contribute.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the folks helping make the magic happen:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1596143293/tcsviqiftrqvssrizdmq.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We believe the time has come to act from an <strong>Abundance of Courage </strong>and change how data is protected, collected, and sold. At Clayton InterGalactic, we believe that people should own their own data. We believe that individuals are better stewards of their data than big corporations. We believe that people should not have to sacrifice privacy for convenience. We believe that people should be paid for their data (especially when that data is being sold by corporations for huge profits).</p>
<p>We are tired of the anger and frustration we, and others, feel every day because of  the lack of control of our own data. Big Tech has proven over and over that they cannot be trusted with our data. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1596143998/spjifz8cszu6trv9ackn.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We knew we had to do something about it. So, we are building the foundations to empower people to take back control of their data. Our tools (hardware and software) help people to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create and manage digital identity.</li>
<li>Control their own data - seriously own their encryption keys and protect their data behind their own encryption.</li>
<li>Build virtual communities based on trust - creating interconnected trusted networks =&gt; ""The Web of Trust""</li>
<li>Determine who to sell data to, for how much, and for how long.</li>
</ul>
<p>To facilitate this digital independence, we are building a line of devices - the Presidio Device Line.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1596143835/hj9kwvxjskv6nhl1ejxs.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We have working prototypes for these, but there is still some work to get to production ready prototypes. That is where you come in - we are inviting you to collaborate with us.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Collaboration</h3>
<p>We are excited about bringing our solutions to market and genuinely believe these solutions will contribute to making the world a better place.  We need your help. We need to understand how different people, communities, and businesses wand to use the devices and what they expect from the Web of Trust.</p>
<p>Specifically, we want a minimum of:</p>
<p>Explain how much funding you need and where it's going. Be transparent and specific-people need to trust you to want to fund you.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>1 Presidio Alaina </strong>Partner to validate features, functionality, and design preferably in a small business setting, or someone who uses lots of storage space (musicians, DJs, movie makers...).</li>
<li>
<strong>3 Presidio Ben </strong>Partners to test prototypes and validate that we really do have the galaxy's fastest VPN (gamers, video conferencers, home learners...).</li>
<li>
<strong>2 Presidio Julia </strong>Partners to help make sure we've got the right level of functionality and value in this entry-level device.</li>
<li>
<strong>10 Will-n-Meena </strong>Partners to test and provide feedback on our software only (cloud) solutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please consider joining us on this adventure.</p>
<p>For your contributions (at hardware device levels), you will receive a production prototype candidate, and potentially upgrades to hardware (if needed to finalize production prototypes).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1596146759/knnzdnuznt8pgwgnuml4.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Moreover, you will be part of the Clayton InterGalactic Community and receive Partner updates. Most importantly, you will be acknowledged and appreciated (at least by the Clayton InterGalactic Community) for contributing to making devices that really work and genuinely deliver value.</p>
<p>As a thank you to our contributors at the hardware and software solution levels, we will send you a really cool 32 GB credit card-sized flash drive. This may be used to send you initial credentials or ISOs but will be yours to keep and cherish.</p>

<h3>The Why</h3>
<p>Each person on our team has numerous ‘why I gotta’ reasons:</p>
<ul><li>“My mom told me she is afraid her credit card info gets exposed to criminals every time she pays for something online. She told me to do something about it.”</li></ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1596147987/pnocktuypuvi86llo1zq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>“Big tech needs to be held accountable. They do not own my data, but they sell it. How can that be okay?”</li>
<li>“My family and I are good, decent people but that doesn’t mean the government, or anyone else, should have access to our personal files, photos of the kids.”</li>
<li> “I don’t trust Facebook, Amazon, or any of the big social media sites to protect our photos and personal information.”</li>
<li>“It is crazy hard to get my photos back from Facebook – I should be able to just download them all.”</li>
<li>“We keep trying to find tools that already do this. Nothing we have tried works the way we need it too. We are going to have to build it ourselves.”</li>
<li>“I don’t want my kids to grow up always being treated like a commodity.”</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1596148059/zxqspwlbtpt36uokrfdp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>“I am so tired of Facebook telling me what to think and feel. Why won’t Facebook just let me see my feed with most recent first? I’m disappointed because I’m pretty sure I know why”</li>
<li>""Siri hates me. Alexa keeps trying to sell me stuff I do not want or need. Google Maps routes me past stores that pay Google Maps even if it is a slower, less-direct route. These are not behaviors of a good personal assistant. Why can’t I have a personal assistant that acts in my interests? Are we going to have to build this?”</li>
<li><i>and so on…</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Mama said so, we are watching out for our kids… families… friends… people who cannot do it without our help. All powerful motivators.</p>
<p>We asked ourselves, “Can we do it?” Unsurprisingly, the answer was, “Yes!!” Then, we asked, “Should we do it?”  We unanimously answered with a “Yes!!”</p>
<p>We answered “Yes!!” because of all our ‘why I gotta’ do it reasons. We answered “Yes!!” because we see a path to a better world. We answered “Yes!!” because it is the right thing to do.</p>

<p>The “should we” question is not a one-time question. We ask it over-and-over. Our conviction only grows. Our list of ‘why I gotta’ reasons keeps growing too. So, Clayton InterGalactic is acting from an <strong>Abundance of Courage</strong> to empower people to control their data. We are building devices and creating an un-platform where people can create their own trusted communities.</p>
<p>Short-term, our Presidio Device Line – which includes 2 devices with the Galaxy’s fastest VPN – and our cloud-based solutions, provide tools to create secure digital identities as well as serve as entry points to the web of trust.</p>
<p>Long-term, we are leading the thought-change that will bring a new era of collaboration to companies and their customers.</p>

<h3>The Risks</h3>
<p>We are doing everything we can to set up ourselves and our contributors for overwhelming success. </p>
<p>With all crowd-funding, there is the risk that people just won't deliver. Maybe the realities of manufacturing don't align with their initial dreams. Maybe they just were not set up to deliver a working product. We have already mitigated this risk:</p>
<ul>
<li>We know our product works - we want help, feedback and insights from Partners to finalize our production prototypes. We may do another Indiegogo campaign when we have our production prototypes ready. </li>
<li>Everyone on our team is really good at what they do - we've all been on high-pressure, mission-critical projects and we've all put great products into production. </li>
<li>Our funding goal represents the cost of hardware for our minimum targets. For this campaign, we are looking to break even on hardware - the rest is figured into our research and product development costs.</li>
</ul>
<p>A very prominent risk is<strong> </strong>there may be more initial demand for the Clayton InterGalactic Presidio product line than we have anticipated.<strong> </strong>Our mitigation plan is multi-faceted:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cap Indiegogo “Perks” so we do not exceed our known assembly capacity.</li>
<li>Allow for pre-orders on our website with clearly identified delivery targets.</li>
<li>Accelerate our employee on-boarding aligned to projections for sales.</li>
<li>Increase investment targets to ensure we have necessary capital to keep up with demand.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is the corollary risk of adoption and sales rates may be below projections. If this risk occurs, we will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Partner with people who do contribute even if we don't reach our minimum targets - that is why we have a flexible goal.</li>
<li>

Dreamery pillow can help side sleeper even with earphones on. It is fluffy on your face and elastically supporting your shoulders. This is comfortable not only for side sleepers but any position sleepers.  According to a study by a sleep research institute, more than 65% of adults have a sleep habit of sleeping on their side.“you will sleep well in correct position!” Is it really comfortable to sleep on your side just because you lie down correctly? Let's find out why Dreamery Pillow is comfortable and hygienic from the three perspectives of structure/material/convenience. <Structure> Comfortable ears will get the side sleepers restfully asleep.The ear (outer ear) is made of cartilage and nerve cells, so you feel pain from stimulation or pressure. The pressure on the ears due to the weight of the head during sleep naturally interferes with sleep. In the case of Dreamery Pillow, the ear is placed on the part where the egg is placed on the screen below. The ears are placed on the upper part marked by the red line in the picture below, and the 3D sewing technique is used below without fillings but elastic net support at the bottom has enough space for the ears to be comfortably stored, so your ears are not pressed against the weight of your head, making them comfortable. The area where the ear is in direct contact is given an aesthetic design and function with a high strength elastic spandex patch.Now there is nothing compressing your ears. Even with wireless earphones, you can sleep while listening to calm music or white noise. Comfortable shoulders will get the side sleepers to relax.The face has a cozy feeling because the silk-like texture and soft cotton are in contact.In the lower part, it is a structure of double filling material that provides a stable and firm support so that the shoulders are not stiff. When jumping from a high place, the primary shock absorption is the foot, the second shock absorption is the principle of bending the knee. The shoulder is comfortable, but the right posture of 13-14cm (5.1-5.5 inch) is maintained so that sleeping on the side is comfortable. Natural movement will get you to sleep comfortably. According to a study by one sleep research institute, although it varies from person to person, it is said that you move your body 30 to 60 times during sleep. If you force your head to be fixed for reasons such as a cervical pillow, it will interfere with sleep, right? Natural sleeping posture change Design and materials that allow easy switching between any sleeping positions.It does not restrain the body and allows easy switching of the natural sleeping position to give you quality sleeping. Of course, it is comfortable to sleep on your back. The (memory cotton / Memorelle Fiber) naturally maintains the shape of the neck curvature, which is different from the typical cotton. The most comfortable height of the pillow for sleeping on the back position varies from person to person, but it is generally said that 6-8cm (2.4-3.1 inch) is the most comfortable height. The memory pad that distributes body pressure evenly and the elastic net support at the bottom maintain a height about 7 cm (2.8 inch). <Material> Applied material science to avoid harmful substances such as bacteria, mites, and house dust. Choosing the pillow fillings and the outer fabric was an important and critical part of this project. There are many pillows made of various materials, but when you have to choose a pillow, there are so many imitations that it is impossible to distinguish by just changing the label, and it is not easy to choose. Cotton pillows are not stable, granular absorbent pillows decrease in volume while using, and expensive pillows are suspicious of internal hygiene.The filling material has problems such as hardening, bacteria, and discoloration, and it has the disadvantage that it cannot be washed in a machine entirely.So, We want to introduce you to the materials that Dreamery Pillow has been working hard on and testing for a long time.The three core materials are (memory cotton / Memorelle Fiber) as the upper filling material, the elastic net supporter as the lower filling material, and microfiber fabric outer surface. (memory cotton / Memorelle Fiber)100% cotton filling material of DACRON from INVISTA, a global company started in 1959, was used.The left pillow is the DACRON (memory cotton / Memorelle Fiber) used pillow, and the right is high quality polyester cotton used pillow.The advantage of DACRON (memory cotton / Memorelle Fiber) is as shown in the demonstration picture above and the test results below.“The feeling of fitting is similar to or better than the memory foam”This (memory cotton / Memorelle Fiber) turns hypoallergenic fibers into active ingredients.The biggest advantage of DACRON memory cotton is that it can be washed entirely in a machine even though it is cotton.Compared to some expensive functional products that are sealed in a cover and difficult to see inside, it is safe to wash off the contamination with a washing machine and to use a high-temperature dryer.(The elastic net support at the bottom cannot be used with a high-temperature dryer. Please refer to “How to wash” instruction below.) • Elastic net supportAs a result of measuring the residual amount of 26 hazardous chemicals by the SGS inspection agency, all of them were undetected, and it is a hygienic material that is protected from any microorganisms.  Household pollution is easily removed just by washing showerhead water with a general detergent. With an air permeability of more than 80%, this material has long-lasting elasticity and excellent resilience to elasticity.The very fine thread used to make the 45g microfiber fabric per square meter physically blocks the entry of harmful substances once more.The silky touch induces a pleasant sleep and DRI-FIT processing was performed to quickly absorb moisture in the human body and discharge out of the pillow.The rough surface of the elastic net support is 5mm (0.2 inch) thick without obstructing ventilation and gives you a nice cushion.It is resistant to friction with other bedding and expresses it as a functional pillow by design. <Convenience> Wash to your moodHOW TO WASHOpen the lower zipper, take out the elastic net support, and close the lower zipper again.Put the pillow body in the enclosed laundry net and put it in the washing machine.Run the washing machine in a mild washing course setting with lukewarm water temperature and mild detergent. You can wash the elastic net support separately as like the previous instruction above. Do not wash with colored laundry. After the pillow is completely dry, tap it with a stick, etc. to bring back the lumps of cotton. The pillow body can be used as a heat dryer, but the elastic net support please follow the instruction above to avoid shape deformation.CAUTIONImmediately after receiving the pillow, wash it once and use it to eliminate water stains due to the nature of the microfiber fabric. Flexible to adjust to desirable pillow heights. Open the lower zipper and insert the pillow support.

Can’t relax? Lacking the sleep you need? The Melange robe was developed by textile experts and wellness-obsessed visionaries to help improve your daily routine.Melange is a premium-grade robe that harnesses the power of Celliant® technology to help improve your body’s ability to regulate your temperature, keeping you more comfortable while you’re relaxing.The robe is engineered using Celliant’s proprietary blend of minerals that naturally cycle energy back into your body in the form of infrared energy. Infrared is well known within the medical community, where it has been used to modulate sleep, protect against stress, and ease joint stiffness. However, there has never been an easy way to incorporate IR into everyday life. To that end, we put it in a unique form that is accessible to everyone.   Melange is the very first robe of its kind to made with Celliant Technology, and that gives it a ton of amazing properties. The scientific benefits of using this technology has been measurably proven to:     
 It has never more difficult to turn your mind off, relax, and recharge. That's why we created the Melange Robe. 60% of the energy we consume is lost thanks to escaping body heat. The Celliant fibers absorb that energy and redirect it back into your body in the form of infrared energy.The minerals used in every fiber were selected for their thermo-reactive ability to effectively convert body heat into infrared energy. This triggers vasodilation in the capillary bed and makes more oxygen available to your cells — resulting in more fuel for your body.Cycling more fuel through your body helps improve blood flow and increases tissue oxygenation by an average of 7%. This is what gives our robe its transformative properties.  The attached data shows that the ash analysis results were positive which means the Melange robe passed certification. We’ve designed the Melange Robe using our innovative Linkweave. This is what makes it visually unique while providing the ultimate in comfort and durability. The weave is comprised of 70% premium cotton and 30% Celliant fibres.Because the Melange Robe is crafted from a combination of high-quality natural and synthetic materials, it’s guaranteed to stay fresh for longer. And when it comes to washing, the fibres are produced using a special infusion process to ensure the Celliant technology never washes out nor breaks down.  
    We know your anatomy is unique, which is why we have engineered the Melange Robe to meet your personal needs. This isn’t a robe for everyone. It is a robe for you. To ensure you get the optimal size we are offering 4 different size variations.

</h3><div>
<p>I am an independent perfumer who has lived in France for the last 4 years. During this time, I have been laying all the groundwork for the launch of a new collection of perfumes.  <br/></p>This campaign is:<br/><br/>
<h4>To support the launch of this new collection of four bright and sunny fragrances,  featuring fragrant native Mediterranean plants and flowers, called the <b>Blue Collection</b>.</h4>
<p></p>
<p> All of the perfumes have been conceived and developed in the

<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>(See perks page to preorder this fragrance...) </b>
</p>
<b></b><h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Story
</h3>We will be working<b> directly with highly respected French producer</b>s of 
essential oils and absolutes, as well as with lesser known artisan distillers, for the amazing fragrant oils and absolutes that will be used in these fragrances. Some are wild plants, and some are certified organic, but most importantly, they come from around the 
Mediterranean and they are infused with the beauty and warmth of the region.  Wild herbs, wild honey, ripe summer fruit, roses, orange blossoms, and conifers... these will all be included in the 4 creations.  Each will tell a part of the story of life in the Mediterranean, from the forests to the beach. <br/><br/><h3>The Perfume Studio<br/>
</h3>
The 1000 Flowers studio is in the centre of the old city of Grasse, a
few steps from the cathedral, and just across a narrow little street from an
old mansion that has a walled garden. Every Spring, the orange trees in that
garden are in full bloom, and the blossoms perfume the whole street.<span>  The scent is so intoxicating, that I
have often imagined how to capture it and to translate it into a perfume. So this year, I began to write the formula, and this fragrance has led to the full collection represented by the colour blue.  </span>
<br/><br/><div>
<p></p>
<b>Why is Blue such a big part of this story?  <br/></b><br/>
<p>The Mediterranean region has a beautiful bright and sunny climate and the sky is often an amazing deep azure blue that is reflected in the intense blue of the sea. This blue has a way of saturating you with its beauty. In-between the blue sky and the blue sea there are native fragrant herbs and flowers as well as trees that flourish. <br/></p>
<p>In the collection, the colour blue will be transmitted visually via the bottles: they’ll be cobalt blue glass and the labels will be bright and colourful, reminiscent of traditional Mediterranean tiles.  </p>

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What is Needed... </h3>
<p> We 
are confirming last minute quotes for the supply chain of bottles, 
pumps (non-crimped of course to stay true to our ethic of a reusable or
 refillable flacon), custom-made outer packaging, certified organic 
non-wheat alcohol base, label printing, and of course the raw 
materials for the perfumes themselves.   
But some of these things are costly, and this is where preorders for the collection will make it happen. <b>This is where you play a crucial role!</b><br/></p>
<h3><b><br/>Costs for this project:</b></h3>
<br/>
<ul><li>
<b>The natural raw materials:  </b> We will be utilizing precious and rare naturals in the formulations, such as French grown Iris butter, and organic Rose from Morocco.  These are rare and production is limited.  Other materials that the collection will feature are:  organic Rose centifolia hydrosol from Grasse, wild Carrot seed from Corsica, wild French black Pine, wild Mediterranean herbs, wild Spanish Labdanum and other fragrant materials produced by a respected French company, such as organic bourbon Ylang ylang, and wild Beeswax absolute.     We have some very highly respected companies 
on-board ready to provide these precious extracts.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Custom made boxes </b>from England. (Very high quality 100% recycled materials.) <br/>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Bottles.</b> The collection will be available in 2 sizes- 100ml cobalt blue glass bottles, and 10ml purse size, spray mini. Both are refillable.<br/>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>The bright colourful labels.</b> The design work is done, but for the 
printing we will be using a small Grasse company who does very 
high quality work. We would like to capture the texture and vibrancy of the hand-painted ceramic tiles from regions around the Mediterranean, and the company we will work with has the capability to create this effect.  <br/>
</li></ul>
<h3>
The Timeline</h3>
<p>The production strategy is to have the collection ready to ship in the second week of December.  For this reason,  depending on where you live, it is possible that you may not receive your perfumes before the 25th of December, but we will keep you informed of exact shipping dates. <br/></p>

garden are in full bloom, and the blossoms perfume the whole street.  The scent is so intoxicating, that I

Why is Blue such a big part of this story?  
The Mediterranean region has a beautiful bright and sunny climate and the sky is often an amazing deep azure blue that is reflected in the intense blue of the sea. This blue has a way of saturating you with its beauty. In-between the blue sky and the blue sea there are native fragrant herbs and flowers as well as trees that flourish. 
In the collection, the colour blue will be transmitted visually via the bottles: they’ll be cobalt blue glass and the labels will be bright and colourful, reminiscent of traditional Mediterranean tiles.  

(Please scroll down to see descriptions of each fragrance in The Blue Collection).



                                                    

What is Needed... 
 We 
are confirming last minute quotes for the supply chain of bottles, 
pumps (non-crimped of course to stay true to our ethic of a reusable or
 refillable flacon), custom-made outer packaging, certified organic 
non-wheat alcohol base, label printing, and of course the raw 
materials for the perfumes themselves.   
But some of these things are costly, and this is where preorders for the collection will make it happen. This is where you play a crucial role!
Costs for this project:


The natural raw materials:   We will be utilizing precious and rare naturals in the formulations, such as French grown Iris butter, and organic Rose from Morocco.  These are rare and production is limited.  Other materials that the collection will feature are:  organic Rose centifolia hydrosol from Grasse, wild Carrot seed from Corsica, wild French black Pine, wild Mediterranean herbs, wild Spanish Labdanum and other fragrant materials produced by a respected French company, such as organic bourbon Ylang ylang, and wild Beeswax absolute.     We have some very highly respected companies 
on-board ready to provide these precious extracts.

Custom made boxes from England. (Very high quality 100% recycled materials.) 


Bottles. The collection will be available in 2 sizes- 100ml cobalt blue glass bottles, and 10ml purse size, spray mini. Both are refillable.


The bright colourful labels. The design work is done, but for the 
printing we will be using a small Grasse company who does very 
high quality work. We would like to capture the texture and vibrancy of the hand-painted ceramic tiles from regions around the Mediterranean, and the company we will work with has the capability to create this effect.  


The Timeline
The production strategy is to have the collection ready to ship in the second week of December.  For this reason,  depending on where you live, it is possible that you may not receive your perfumes before the 25th of December, but we will keep you informed of exact shipping dates. 

The Impact
1000 Flowers is an artisan company and
 by getting involved,  you will be supporting the launch of a sunny, 
conscientious, and unique collection of fragrances.  This way you will have exclusive 
access to these perfumes before they are commercially available, and you 
will be part of a true story that has been distilled
 under a
 perfect blue sky.

They are vectors for transmitting dangerous diseases such as Zika, Malaria, Dengue Fever, Yellow Fever, Chikungunya, Encephalitis and the West Nile Virus. They kill millions of people each year. The most vulnerable people are children, pregnant women, and the elderly. No other bite kills more humans or makes more of us sick than pesky mosquitoes.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490283397/bmymyf0fgc2uihsnkidm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p>The solution is the ElimiFly. This device effectively captures mosquitoes and helps control their population wherever the device is placed, preventing bites and the transmission of these terrible diseases to you and your family.</p><p>The ElimiFly mosquito trap is effective, quiet, simple to use, and eco-friendly. It requires only 5 watts of energy (different plug options available for out of country backers) and uses a biodegradable, non-toxic attractant, made with FDA-approved ingredients, to lure mosquitoes. This attractant lures mosquitoes into the ElimiFly’s fan. The fan then pulls them into a deadly trap. Once in the trap, there is no way for the mosquitoes to escape, and they die.</p><p>UV light traps have been proven ineffective. Repellents, creams, and candles keep mosquitoes away for only a few hours. The ElimiFly’s attractant provides a long-lasting, highly effective solution by replicating our natural secretions and cleverly luring mosquitoes into the trap. Furthermore, the ElimiFly is designed to only attract mosquitos. Very few butterflies, moths, and bees die, unlike UV traps.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491800911/uf9lakoyyvmso4ku8mbc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>How the funds will be used</h3><p>The funds will be used to purchase the different components needed to assemble the ElimiFly, including injection molds, attractant ingredients and packaging, fans, USB power supplies, final product packaging, and distribution. We have obtained price quotes for all of the different components required to assemble the ElimiFly.  Manufacturing and assembly companies are standing by, ready to produce it. </p><h3>Help us manufacture in the U.S. !</h3><p>If this Indiegogo campaign is successful, we will manufacture the ElimiFly in the U.S. Help us reach our goal and spread the word so we can get the funds to make it right here. We really want to make this product in the U.S. With your help, we can. </p><h3>What's in the ElimiFly Starter Kit?</h3><p>The following will be included with the purchase of the ElimiFly Starter Kit:  </p><ul>
<li>The ElimiFly Trap.</li>
<li>A month's supply of attractant (*3 months, 6 months or a year supply available for purchase.)</li>

<li>You can use Octenol that can be bought online.  Just place inside the trap, it works, but does not attract tiger mosquitos effectively.</li>
<li>Use a piece of clothing that has sweat on it. Recently used sweaty socks work the best. Just place a couple inside the trap and that will do the job. Your socks might get soiled with mosquitos, and you might have to toss them. </li>
<li>Make your own, mixing sugar with activated yeast and water. Make sure it is activated yeast, otherwise it won't work. This option is more difficult to handle. Spillages are common, but it works. </li>
</ul><p>After a successful campaign, we can't wait to see all the mosquitoes you eliminate!

They are vectors for transmitting dangerous diseases such as Zika, Malaria, Dengue Fever, Yellow Fever, Chikungunya, Encephalitis and the West Nile Virus. They kill millions of people each year. The most vulnerable people are children, pregnant women, and the elderly. No other bite kills more humans or makes more of us sick than pesky mosquitoes. The solution is the ElimiFly. This device effectively captures mosquitoes and helps control their population wherever the device is placed, preventing bites and the transmission of these terrible diseases to you and your family.The ElimiFly mosquito trap is effective, quiet, simple to use, and eco-friendly. It requires only 5 watts of energy (different plug options available for out of country backers) and uses a biodegradable, non-toxic attractant, made with FDA-approved ingredients, to lure mosquitoes. This attractant lures mosquitoes into the ElimiFly’s fan. The fan then pulls them into a deadly trap. Once in the trap, there is no way for the mosquitoes to escape, and they die.UV light traps have been proven ineffective. Repellents, creams, and candles keep mosquitoes away for only a few hours. The ElimiFly’s attractant provides a long-lasting, highly effective solution by replicating our natural secretions and cleverly luring mosquitoes into the trap. Furthermore, the ElimiFly is designed to only attract mosquitos. Very few butterflies, moths, and bees die, unlike UV traps.How the funds will be usedThe funds will be used to purchase the different components needed to assemble the ElimiFly, including injection molds, attractant ingredients and packaging, fans, USB power supplies, final product packaging, and distribution. We have obtained price quotes for all of the different components required to assemble the ElimiFly.  Manufacturing and assembly companies are standing by, ready to produce it. Help us manufacture in the U.S. !If this Indiegogo campaign is successful, we will manufacture the ElimiFly in the U.S. Help us reach our goal and spread the word so we can get the funds to make it right here. We really want to make this product in the U.S. With your help, we can. What's in the ElimiFly Starter Kit?The following will be included with the purchase of the ElimiFly Starter Kit:  
The ElimiFly Trap.
A month's supply of attractant (*3 months, 6 months or a year supply available for purchase.)
USB Power Supply.
Free US shipping.
 SpecificationsSize: The ElimiFly measures 9"" x 6"" x 5-1/4"".Coverage: 1 acre. Power consumption: 5 VDC, 5 Watts. The AttractantElimiFly's most powerful attractant was designed to attract mosquitoes, especially the so called tiger-mosquito responsible for Zika; it takes advantage of the generation of CO2 by metabolizing sugar. The addition of natural fragrances increases its potency, all put together in an easy to use delivery container. Our attractant has a pleasant smell and can be used inside the house.Other sources of Attractants:There are various sources of attractant that can be used with the ElimiFly. These include the following:
You can use Octenol that can be bought online.  Just place inside the trap, it works, but does not attract tiger mosquitos effectively.
Use a piece of clothing that has sweat on it. Recently used sweaty socks work the best. Just place a couple inside the trap and that will do the job. Your socks might get soiled with mosquitos, and you might have to toss them. 
Make your own, mixing sugar with activated yeast and water. Make sure it is activated yeast, otherwise it won't work. This option is more difficult to handle. Spillages are common, but it works. 
After a successful campaign, we can't wait to see all the mosquitoes you eliminate! You'll be able to connect with ElimiFly on social media and share your pictures with us. Help spread the word about ElimiFly!Solar Power and Other OptionsYou could use a 5-volt lithium cell phone battery charger for locations where power is hard to reach (not included with ElimiFly purchase).
A 1,000 mAh will last approx 2.5 hrs.
In the picture below, the light blue battery is 4,000 mAh and will last approx 10 hrs. 
The black one is 16,750 mAh and will last approx 42 hrs.

​    A solar panel can be used for locations where there is no electrical power, using the micro USB connection (available now; see our perks options).​Solar Panel approx 12"" x 6"" with micro USB connector.We are currently considering producing multiple sizes and an ultra-portable mini ElimiFly.

The donated systems will be hand delivered at no cost to them or their families as a “Thank You” to these organizations and veterans for all they have done and continue to do for us.</p><p>Like most “best friend” stories, ours began as kids over 15 years ago. As a freshman, Kyle was in a terrible ATV accident and broke his neck. We didn't know if he would make it, but with the support of friends, family, and Shriner's Hospital for Children, Kyle is not only alive but thriving. Thanks to Shriner's generous surgical donation, Kyle was able to use his hands to design and build ChairGLO’s first prototypes helping make himself and other wheelchair users safer at night. Additionally, a lot of our family and friends are veterans. Without their sacrifices, none of us would be here which is why we are including the Wounded Warriors Project in our campaign, as well.</p><p><strong>RISK &amp; CHALLENGES:</strong></p><p>We are constantly working to raise the bar on our services. As such, we have been reaching out to backup manufacturers and suppliers to make sure we will be able to meet potential demand. However, there is a risk that all systems will not be able to shipped before Christmas. In order to prevent this from happening, we will be placing orders with suppliers mid-campaign. If this small-round is successful, we plan to use the lessons learned and market research from this campaign to launch our second round of funding next year.</p><p>This experience has taught us more than either of our MBA’s ever could have taught us: Passion is the fire that will fuel any successful endeavor. Like most entrepreneurs we get tired, but then we remember the smiling faces of the 32 people, veterans, children, and parents who we are fortunate enought to call our customers. It is in those moments of exhaustion that we think of their faces and the faces of our friends who are no longer with us, who are no longer able to wake up to another day. We love what we do and are passionate about ChairGLO’s success because it allows us to help people, plain and simple.</p><p>We can’t promise that we won’t encounter problems.

Two friends, with one passion: to light up the lives of others one LED System at a time.Thirteen years ago, Kyle was in a terrible accident and broke his neck. Over the years, he has faced more obstacles than I could ever begin to imagine let alone understand or explain. Yet, he has always persevered. Fall 2015, two friends sat down to dinner and realized that by combining their strengths, they could both follow their dreams: thus, ChairGLO was born.We are committed to improving the lives of our customers, our friends, which is why we build products to improve our users’ safety, social experiences, and nighttime adventures.WHAT WE NEED & WHAT YOU GET:We need your support to increase our manufacturing levels to over 100 systems in order to decrease costs to new and future customers. In return, you get the perk of choosing to help us give the gift of light or lighting up your next adventure with a personal ChairGLO LED Lighting System of your own. Each system has all of the product features and attributes listed below.THE IMPACT:Our goal of $15,000, will not only allow us to provide the wheelchair community with a safer, cooler, and more affordable lighting system but it will also allow us to donate ChairGLO systems to children at Shriner’s Hospital and to veterans via the Wounded Warrior Project. The donated systems will be hand delivered at no cost to them or their families as a “Thank You” to these organizations and veterans for all they have done and continue to do for us.Like most “best friend” stories, ours began as kids over 15 years ago. As a freshman, Kyle was in a terrible ATV accident and broke his neck. We didn't know if he would make it, but with the support of friends, family, and Shriner's Hospital for Children, Kyle is not only alive but thriving. Thanks to Shriner's generous surgical donation, Kyle was able to use his hands to design and build ChairGLO’s first prototypes helping make himself and other wheelchair users safer at night. Additionally, a lot of our family and friends are veterans. Without their sacrifices, none of us would be here which is why we are including the Wounded Warriors Project in our campaign, as well.RISK & CHALLENGES:We are constantly working to raise the bar on our services. As such, we have been reaching out to backup manufacturers and suppliers to make sure we will be able to meet potential demand. However, there is a risk that all systems will not be able to shipped before Christmas. In order to prevent this from happening, we will be placing orders with suppliers mid-campaign. If this small-round is successful, we plan to use the lessons learned and market research from this campaign to launch our second round of funding next year.This experience has taught us more than either of our MBA’s ever could have taught us: Passion is the fire that will fuel any successful endeavor. Like most entrepreneurs we get tired, but then we remember the smiling faces of the 32 people, veterans, children, and parents who we are fortunate enought to call our customers. It is in those moments of exhaustion that we think of their faces and the faces of our friends who are no longer with us, who are no longer able to wake up to another day. We love what we do and are passionate about ChairGLO’s success because it allows us to help people, plain and simple.We can’t promise that we won’t encounter problems. However, we can promise to always persevere and to fulfill this goal and our obligations to you, our friends.OTHER  WAYS YOU CAN HELPNo funds, NO PROBLEM!

Shipping cost and time varies according to the destination location and the shipping option selected. Are there any bubbles in the decal after application?There usually are a few bubbles in the decal after it is applied to the wall surface, but they are easily smoothed out.Can the decals be trimmed?The decals are easily trimmed with ordinary scissors. Are the decals reusable?The decals are easily repositionable many times but we see these as single-project use. It is difficult to get the decal back onto the release paper for storage and later reuse. It’s possible, but tricky. You can always leave the decals on their backings if you want to reuse them in other projects without reordering. Can the decals be repainted?The decals can certainly be repainted if you choose to do so. Can the decals be recycled?Recycling requirements vary from location to location.  You will need to check with your local recycling center to see if they accept painted plastic materials. We are looking into the possibility of partnering with a recycling center to make the process easier for those who wish to recycle but do not have access to a facility. Where are you located?Our warehouse facility will be located in Chattanooga, Tennessee.",35.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I’ve
always been a serial entrepreneur my entire adult life.<span>  In the mid 1990’s, a buddy of mine and I
developed several patented products for the do-it-yourself marketplace.  Over a four year period of time I built the

my partner. </span></p>
<p>With the
recent changes in attitude towards medical marijuana and the movement of many
states to fast track recreational use, the marketplace is now open to more

<p>While
perusing various websites searching accessories, I noticed that there were no
good answers for carrying a one-hitter + poker and the marijuana.<span>  The closest thing was a Dug Out.  I had owned one of those 20 years past and
remembered that it always smelled and I eventually lost the lid.  Most of my friends who smoke carry a zip
lock baggy and a one hitter.  With the
pungent aroma of the new marijuana – you can smell it from 6 feet away.</span></p>
<p>Your
BUDHUB came to me like a light switch flipping to “ON”.<span>  I
found nothing in the marketplace that was designed to carry a one-hitter bat,
poker and have room for the product – all kept in a smell-proof container – yet
be compact and durable.  </span></p>
<p>It started as a
rough sketch of my idea, thorough research and filing a utility patent before I

<p></p>
<p>What could the AC Companion do for your community?  If your local school system was able to save money on energy costs, that could potentially mean more money for education, teachers, books, sports, and after school programs.  If your local supermarket saved money on their energy costs, those cost savings could make their way to the consumer with cheaper products on the shelves.  If your employer saved money on their operating costs, this could result in raises and higher wages.</p>

<p>Similar to a battery, the AC Companion utilizes an ice vessel to store it's energy.  The ice vessel will vary in size depending on your cooling needs, but will be small enough and light enough to rest near or on top of your residence or building.  During the day, the energy from the ice vessel is transferred by your refrigerant through your existing system.  </p>
<p>In some cases, the ice vessel may last for several days, but eventually it will need recharging.  The system can be programmed to recharge itself during off peak hours, or during a time when the temperature outside is more conducive for creating ice.  The recharging time will vary on the size of the ice vessel, but in most cases, it will take 15 - 30 minutes and only use the amount of energy required to run a standard light bulb.  </p>

<p>Currently, we are in our Beta test phase.  We have been working with a handful of local businesses and one city entity who have expressed interest in being one of the first to be outfitted with the AC Companion.  These businesses are being set up at a minimal cost so that we may continue to collect real world data.</p>
<p>We are seeking funds to help us secure office space and a warehouse facility so that we can begin shipping parts to be assembled and continue our testing.  Our staff is currently limited, and everyone thus far is donating their time and energy into growing this adventure.  </p>
<p>At AC Companion we are working diligently to
bring this unit to market for the betterment of society as a whole. <br/></p>
<p>We know through our validated testing that
this AC Companion will reduce energy consumption and save communities (potentially)
millions of dollars.  Not to mention that with this reduction in energy
consumption this unit will reduce the need for communities to implement
brown outs to save stress on the energy grid.  Without the need for brown
outs, every person (fixed income or not) will be able to stay cool in the heat
of the summer at a reasonable cost, thus reducing and potentially
eliminating the chance for loss of life nationwide. </p>
<p><span class="""">However, as it stands now, this technology is
unheard of.  Therefore the cost to produce one of these units has become prohibitive.
Yes, we as a society have priced ourselves out of potential lifesaving and
financial saving measures.  It truly has become all about the almighty
dollar. Thus, this has truly become a two part process for us at</span> AC Companion<span class=""""> at this point in time.</span></p>
<p>Part one brings us to you, the society we are
working to better.  We are in need of these funds so that we can build
these exclusive parts ourselves, and purchase those parts that are available to
buy, in such quantity that we can ensure the savings we need to pass on
to you, the consumer.</p>
<p>The second part of this is that we have
intentionally stayed away from main stream funding because we strongly believe (from
those we have spoken to) that the powers that be will attempt to shelf this
unit to protect their investment, rather than to protect the consumer and the lives of those who
are so harshly affected by the summertime heat. </p>

<p>We will keep you updated on our progress so stay tuned........</p>

We know through our validated testing that
this AC Companion will reduce energy consumption and save communities (potentially)
millions of dollars.  Not to mention that with this reduction in energy
consumption this unit will reduce the need for communities to implement
brown outs to save stress on the energy grid.  Without the need for brown
outs, every person (fixed income or not) will be able to stay cool in the heat
of the summer at a reasonable cost, thus reducing and potentially
eliminating the chance for loss of life nationwide. 
However, as it stands now, this technology is
unheard of.  Therefore the cost to produce one of these units has become prohibitive.
Yes, we as a society have priced ourselves out of potential lifesaving and
financial saving measures.  It truly has become all about the almighty
dollar. Thus, this has truly become a two part process for us at AC Companion at this point in time.
Part one brings us to you, the society we are
working to better.  We are in need of these funds so that we can build
these exclusive parts ourselves, and purchase those parts that are available to
buy, in such quantity that we can ensure the savings we need to pass on
to you, the consumer.
The second part of this is that we have
intentionally stayed away from main stream funding because we strongly believe (from
those we have spoken to) that the powers that be will attempt to shelf this
unit to protect their investment, rather than to protect the consumer and the lives of those who
are so harshly affected by the summertime heat. 

We will keep you updated on our progress so stay tuned........",1.0,1,"1 Campaign
