Lovecraft's Dreamlands and thought...""I wish this was funnier and gorier""?Are you excited by stories that keep you on your toes and make you question the very fabric of reality?Then you are going to love Ichabod Jones: Monster Hunter.Ichabod Jones is about a mental patient that escapes an asylum and becomes a monster hunter during the Apocalypse, but doesn't know if he's killing monsters, humans, or if it's all in his head the whole time.  It's a complete fantastical and psychological mindscrew. Ichabod comes from a deep, almost primordial, place in my soul. It's the part that devours movies like In the Mouth of Madness, Event Horizon, and Jacob's Ladder, while still binging on Gravity Falls, Frankenweenie, and Army of Darkness. It's the part that read Johnny the Homicidal Maniac and laughed hysterically at every gruesome scene.All of that went into Ichabod Jones Monster Hunter. We delivered volume 2 of the story in January, and now we're back with the never-before-seen THIRD volume of Ichabod Jones: Monster Hunter, with Renzo Podesta back on art duties. We're now ready to release the third volume of Ichabod Jones: Monster Hunter, a 96-page hardcover.What is the story about, really?Ichabod isn't about some mental patient who's ruthlessly killing people. It's about a broken man, who was cast off by society, and whether that person, a person who nobody wants, can be a hero.Can he find his place in the world? Can he come to terms with everything that he's done? Can he become a hero?I'm very interested in that idea, as a person who is severely broken myself. I've had depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember, and it's getting worse with every passing year.I never felt like I fit in for the first 30 years of my life. It wasn't until I went out into the world and became the hero of my own story that I started to think that maybe I wasn't the worst human being on the planet.Ichabod, though, came from a place where I was very much alone, broken, and wondering if it would ever get better.I think what makes Ichabod really special is that it was started by a person who never knew if he could be fixed, one who felt like he was cast off from society, and now it's being written by a person who understands that the broken bits are what make him special.See, Ichabod, at its core, is about hope. It's about taking what's special about you and using it to bring light into the world; of shining hope in a bleak universe. Ichabod's world is harrowing and awful, but Ichabod can bring light into it, not despite of being broken, but because of it.A psychological mind screwIchabod Jones is about a mental patient that escapes from an asylum and becomes a monster hunter during the Apocalypse, but he doesn't know if he's killing monsters, humans, or it's all in his head the whole time.Ichabod has been imprisoned in a mental asylum for crimes he definitely committed. When he was arrested, the police found him wrist-deep in the guts of his latest victim.While he's never claimed he was innocent, he says he only committed atrocious acts because an authoritative, and unwelcome, voice in his head told him he was doing God's work.He tried to say no to the voice, but it was very insistent and persuasive. It told Ichabod that the people he was killing were monsters and he was saving the world by murdering them.He was wrong...or so he thought.At the beginning of the story, Ichabod wakes up in the Apocalypse, being chased by a monster trying to devour his soul. He has no choice but to use his training as a monster hunter to fight off the beast, and accept his fate as the savior of the world.He meets a band of other inmates, helps them escape the asylum, and they begin their long journey across the desert to freedom, trying to carve out a bit of humanity as they go.Something strange happens to Ichabod throughout the story, and I say strange in a tale that is already at 11 on the strange meter.Every now and then...he snaps back to another place, where he's sitting with his doctor, talking out what just happened to him, or on the run from the law, and definitely NOT in the Apocalypse.Is he really there, is it a memory, or is he having a psychological break?It's that juxtaposition between reality and perception that makes Ichabod special. It's not just an Apocalypse story, or a dark fantasy tale, or a chosen one book. It also messing with your very perception of the universe, and whether Ichabod is truly a hero, or a psychopath killing the innocent.After all, he was wrong about being a savior once, and that's what got him locked away in the first place. What's to say he's not wrong again, only now he's having a much more vivid hallucination?Or perhaps he's only fantasizing about being a hero, while being locked in his cell, unable to smell freedom ever again.What other people are saying about IchabodWe've gotten some great reviews over the years.If you’ve got a taste for unconventional and offbeat horror, then don’t miss Ichabod Jones: Monster Hunter!"" – Bryant Dillon, President: Fanbase Presshttps://fanbasepress.com/index.php/blogs/bryant-dillon/item/1072-ichabod-jones-monster-hunter-review""Ichabod Jones: Monster Hunter – is a glimpse into the abyss.

<h2><u><strong>What's Daughter of Titan about?</strong></u></h2>
<p>Daughter of Titan follows Alena Amar, a young woman living in the city-state of Tridecca City, who discovers she is the descendant of the world's last true superhero ""Titan"".</p>
<p>This sounds like it would be amazing right? Unfortunately, despite Alena's desire to do good, a Titan revival has its detractors; ranging from the head of a shady government augmentation program to the ex-augmented detective who hunts for illegal augmentations, from Lovecraftian monsters in another dimension to her own disapproving parents. </p>
<p>The series has been inspired by the way superhero comics portray women and the lack of diversity within the industry.</p>

<h3><u><strong>Here's a brief overview of the story</strong></u></h3>
<p>The story is set in Tridecca city, a sprawling metropolis that is comprised of thirteen American and Canadian cities that have banded together as the rest of North America fell into disarray. On top of the regular police force, there exists a government program that uses augmentations to raise regular officers to near superhuman capabilities called the ""augthorities"".  However, public opinion of the augthorities is low with reports of brutality. </p>

<p><i>Nice guys don't get to be the head of a </i><i>multi billion</i><i> dollar human augmentation program.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Enter Alena Amar, once a promising robotics student, who dropped it to appease her ""realist"" parents who see no future in the branch of robotics she is pursuing. </p>
<p>In issue 1 when cornered one night by a mugger, she discovers she has superhuman powers. Before she can act, two augthority officers appear and deal with the mugger in a brutal fashion that even raises sympathy from Alena herself.  </p>
<p>She confides in her best friend and fellow robotics prodigy Suzanne Perkins and learns Suzanne is building a super suit to replace the augmentation program. Its design was based on the urban legend of Titan. They decide to combine their talents and try and make the world a better place. </p>

<p>Now in issue #2 Titan's return has not gone unnoticed which has brought General Dwight Rossiter and Detective Frank Brenner onto the scene. </p>

<p>Frank Brenner was the most successful agent on the augmentation program. But augmentations take their toll on the mind and now Brenner suffers from a series of mental conditions.

<p>But sitting in a fancy office sits an even greater threat, an old rival of Titan watches on, waiting for the right moment to tear open a hole to a hellscape dimension and settle an age-old score. </p>

<p>The art team and editor behind this comic are all women, which I have received criticism for by a small sect of the comics community that think by giving women the chance to shine in a male-dominated industry, I am committing some egregious crime.

<p>We actually ran a very successful Kickstarter campaign last month, raising 250% of what we needed. Despite the popularity, some people still missed out on the campaign.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are literally no risks. All of the art is complete, just the colouring and lettering for the final few pages. After that, I will be handing it back to the editor to do one final overall check and then they will be prepped to be sent out!</p>
</div></div>","What's Daughter of Titan about?
Daughter of Titan follows Alena Amar, a young woman living in the city-state of Tridecca City, who discovers she is the descendant of the world's last true superhero ""Titan"".
This sounds like it would be amazing right? Unfortunately, despite Alena's desire to do good, a Titan revival has its detractors; ranging from the head of a shady government augmentation program to the ex-augmented detective who hunts for illegal augmentations, from Lovecraftian monsters in another dimension to her own disapproving parents. 
The series has been inspired by the way superhero comics portray women and the lack of diversity within the industry.

Greatness has thrust itself upon Alena Amar. How will she use her powers?

<h3>About the Artist</h3>
<p>Jason Williams has been tattooing for over 20 years and has recently made the venture into creating his own fan-based comic book. He is a lover of all things horror and comics, and has decided to merge his two loves into one. For the past few months, he has worked diligently on a Batman vs. Jason fan-based graphic novel. By supporting our campaign, you will aide in his dream coming to fruition and bringing it to all horror and comic lovers alike. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What's in it for me?</h3>
<p>A fully detailed graphic novel, a custom designed book marker, an autographed poster of your choosing, a first pick of your very own Batman OR Jason cover, along with an assortment of trading cards of characters from the graphic novel could be yours based on your contribution. Any and all funding contributed will pay for the comic. That includes but is not limited to the printing, distribution, and custom covers for the comic. It will also pay for the book markers, cards, and posters.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Jason has always had a love and passion for the Friday the 13th films ever since he was a boy. His grandmother used to take him to the theaters to see the films. Batman, in his opinion, is the greatest superhero of all time. Jason has always wanted to see the two in some type of medium and as a result, he took it upon himself to make it happen not only for himself, but for the world as well. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Jason has already invested much of his time into the artwork. So far, he has sketched over 50 pages and inked approximately 10 pages and is still going strong. Working on this project has taken up a lot of his time. He has put himself on a tight deadline to see this dream of his come true and continues to work tirelessly on a least 1 page a day. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

Vigilante Convention will be a small convention in NYC that will bring together select cast members and you, the Flash/Arrow fan community. We hope that you'll join us in all the activities we have planned. We will be having Q&A's, photo ops, autographs, parties and contests. Our team is made up of fans of not only the Flash and Arrow TV shows but who have been in the superhero and sci-fi/fantasy fandoms for over 20 years! We are fan fic writers, vidders, fic readers and all around fangirls and fanboys.  We have a passion for fandom and for conventions, large and small. We hope to combine our experience and knowledge to bring you an amazing event.We look forward to seeing you in NYC next March and thanks so much for checking out our IGG Pre-Sale!
Dates: March 19-20, 2016 with Registration and a Pre-Party on Friday, March 18, 2016.
What We Need
The cost of putting on an event of this magnitude is daunting for our team and so we need help in raising money for it. This IGG will be the springboard for all the great things we have planned. Below is a small list of what we need to make Vigilante Convention it's best:


Venue space - we need rooms for panels, parties, photo ops, etc. 
Guest Appearance Fees. 
Audio/Visual staff and equipment like microphones, speakers, projectors, screens.
Photography/Videography equipment.
Business registration fees.
T-shirts and program books


Reaching our goal means that we can really kickstart our planning and get Vigilante Convention off the ground.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello and thank you for giving me the chance to talk about my fantasy comic book series called Elfwood which is my first comic book project. I released a printed and digital version of Elfwood on Kickstarter back in March 2020 with 100 backers and 200 printed copies containing 21 beautifully illustrated pages. I am passionate about storytelling and creating something that is unique and unexpected. I was inspired a variety of sources such as the comic book series SAGA, LOTR, Game of Thrones and Greek and Norse mythology as well as certain historical events. Most Elf-centric fantasy stories tend to start off in the medieval period . In the fantasy community there is a love of medieval and renaissance story telling, yet I took a huge risk and developed a story that is placed during the early years of civilization when the first powerful nations are appearing. Our story focuses on two great continents divided by a massive sea. The northern continent is filled with mountainous forests and a vast cold tundra where human nomads wander, while the costal lands are dominated by a militaristic naval power called the Sea People who are the first human civilization and who live in city-states along the coast. In the warmer southern continent most elves live in primitive tribes except for the kingdom of Elfwood which is the most advanced early civilization. The elves of Elfwood live within carved out massive trees within very dense forests. The leader of the Sea people is a commander named Azari who has a lust for war. Azari was based on the Greek god Aries except more intelligent and more aggressive. The leader of Elfwood is a queen named Akara who was inspired by the greek goddesses Artimis and Athena as well as the Roman goddess Vesta. The culture of the Sea People were in part inspired by Greek and Viking naval culture, while the Elf culture was inspired by Minoan culture. Every culture in the story will feature a great wonder of some kind. In Elfwood #1 that will be represented by a great statue of the Elfwood goddess of creation.  Issue 2 will feature the Sea People's great wonder. Issue 1 focuses on the first battle in the war between humans and elves and will set-up the theme of the stories to follow. The series will later introduce other races, creatures and themes such as the Orcs, fairies and dragons as well as the discovery of magic. The elves in my story are about a foot shorter than humans, so about 4 to 5 feet, while humans range from 5 to 6 feet. Faries are about 3 inches tall and Orcs are about 6 to 7 feet tall. Our Orcs will look more like a human/orc hybrid and would be an evolutionally off shoot of the humans. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The funding generated from this campaign would be used to develop Elfwood Issue #2. Our ultimate goal is to develop this into a single graphic novel telling one complete story. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Developing a comic book requires a team that includes a writer, artist, cover artist(s), inker and letterer which is surprisingly costly. Since issue #1 is complete as long as this campaign is successful, you will receive a PDF copy of issue #1. With the goal amount of $250 we can develop about 8 pages into issue #2 which would be amazing and we would start developing immediately. If we raise more money than that, we will use it to develop more pages and could possibly develop variant covers. If we don't reach our goal, you will still receive a copy of issue #1 and the raised funds will be used to develop as much as we can of the next issue.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<p>In order to build trust we are offering Indiegogo backers a discounted rate on the digital version of Elfwood #1 for only $3 which is a $2 discount from my Kickstarter campaign. If you want to contribute more that would be appreciated.  If you like issue #1 please note that all future digital comics will always be under $5 per issue and will be available on Indiegogo.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>NONE. Issue 1 is 100% completed and ready to be delivered. I am 200% motivated and excited to get started on issue #2. The only risk is whether or not the backers will like the comic which is why I am offering a discounted rate of only $3. </p>

<p>There are always risks and challenges in everything we do. This is my 16th Crowdfunding project, and in the time I've spent self-publishing comic books I have experienced printing and shipping delays, creative differences, and people dropping out of a project in the middle of production. These are things that have happened and will always happen. That is why I have tried to limit as many of the x-factors on this campaign as possible, by starting first with an art production team that knows and has worked with each other for years. As I said many times before, this book is already made, all we have to do is print it up. I hope to limit as many mistakes in printing and shipping as possible. I have found out there is always a snag or two that will happen. Aside from that, I hope our library and past campaign success and fulfillment speaks for itself in regards to the quality of our comic books.</p>

<h3><strong>Why make a superhero comic book?</strong></h3>
<p>Because I have a story to tell. My love and passion for comic books growing up drove me to put new spins on some of the characters and stories I read growing up. What if, Elseworlds and even Amalgam comics showed me there are great ways to take the classic concepts in a new direction and still stay true to the source material. If you look hard enough into Unstoppable Comics you may be able to identify some of those very sources of material. I am here to have fun and entertain you as much as myself.  I feel Superheroes are a modern-day form of mythology and even though there are other companies doing it longer there is still space to add to it.</p>
<h3><strong>Who is on the creative team?</strong></h3>
<p><b>Brandon Easton/Writer:</b> Brandon's talent as a writer has landed him credits on some pretty strong geek cred properties such as Transformers: War for Cybertron, Thundercats (2011), and Peggy Carter: Agent of Shield in television.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i><u><strong>WHY DOES THIS BOOK COST 8.4K TO FUND?</strong></u></i></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>Creating comic books is a very complex and meticulous process involving multiple skill sets. The process begins with a script from the writer. From then, an artist spends hours illustrating just one page. Now comes in the colorist, who spends as much time on a page filling in colors. To the letterer, who carefully places the dialogue bubbles, captions, and effects. </p>
<p>In full transparency, the $15,000 goal is set to cover the creative teams rate across all 140 pages, and a small print run. That's it. Meaning the colors, letterers and printings are paid for in this total.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u><i><strong>STRETCH GOALS</strong></i></u></h2>
<p>With increased funding simply means our customers are helping to build a better book. The goals we have are as follows:</p>
<p>$8,400: The one-hundred and forty page book is completely funded, which includes a digital copy of the book and my previous book WICKED.</p>
<p>$15,000: The one-hundred and forty page book will have colors. </p>
<p>$20,750: Variant cover prints by Caanan White or Zawaru will be made avaiable!</p>
<p>$25,950:  Brett Booth (@Demonpuppy) artwork!</p>
<p>$30,450: Interior paper upgrade.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u>PLEASE READ CAREFULLY</u></strong></p>
<p>A referral contest rewards the referrer who brings in additional backers or funding. Because my campaign’s dashboard allows for me to track referrals through the insights tab. I'm able to see the Indiegogo users who are directing traffic to my campaign in terms of the number of contributions to the project.</p>
<p>For a backer to count as a referrer, they must promote this campaign with Indiegogo’s share tools while logged into their Indiegogo account. This is important because otherwise, your unique ID won’t be attached to any resulting contributions or visits.</p>
<p>For example: When Funder A is logged into their account and uses Indiegogo’s share tools to send a tweet, the link in the tweet includes Funder A’s unique ID. Then, when Funder B reads the tweet and clicks through the link to contribute, Funder A is recognized as helping bring in the amount contributed by Funder B and traffic.</p>
<p><u><strong>IMPORTANT NOTES:</strong></u></p>
<ul>
<li><u>REFERRERS MUST ALSO BE BACKERS, TO RECEIVE THE REWARD!</u></li>
<li>The person who clicked on the referral link must immediately make a contribution after clicking on the referral link. If they visit other pages or websites or leave and come back to the campaign later to contribute, their contribution will not be counted as a referral.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>REFERRAL CONTEST STIPULATIONS:</u></strong></p>

WHY DOES THIS BOOK COST 8.4K TO FUND?
 
Creating comic books is a very complex and meticulous process involving multiple skill sets. The process begins with a script from the writer. From then, an artist spends hours illustrating just one page. Now comes in the colorist, who spends as much time on a page filling in colors. To the letterer, who carefully places the dialogue bubbles, captions, and effects. 
In full transparency, the $15,000 goal is set to cover the creative teams rate across all 140 pages, and a small print run. That's it. Meaning the colors, letterers and printings are paid for in this total.
STRETCH GOALS
With increased funding simply means our customers are helping to build a better book. The goals we have are as follows:
$8,400: The one-hundred and forty page book is completely funded, which includes a digital copy of the book and my previous book WICKED.
$15,000: The one-hundred and forty page book will have colors. 
$20,750: Variant cover prints by Caanan White or Zawaru will be made avaiable!
$25,950:  Brett Booth (@Demonpuppy) artwork!
$30,450: Interior paper upgrade.
 
REFERRAL CONTEST:

PLEASE READ CAREFULLY
A referral contest rewards the referrer who brings in additional backers or funding. Because my campaign’s dashboard allows for me to track referrals through the insights tab. I'm able to see the Indiegogo users who are directing traffic to my campaign in terms of the number of contributions to the project.
For a backer to count as a referrer, they must promote this campaign with Indiegogo’s share tools while logged into their Indiegogo account. This is important because otherwise, your unique ID won’t be attached to any resulting contributions or visits.
For example: When Funder A is logged into their account and uses Indiegogo’s share tools to send a tweet, the link in the tweet includes Funder A’s unique ID. Then, when Funder B reads the tweet and clicks through the link to contribute, Funder A is recognized as helping bring in the amount contributed by Funder B and traffic.
IMPORTANT NOTES:

REFERRERS MUST ALSO BE BACKERS, TO RECEIVE THE REWARD!
The person who clicked on the referral link must immediately make a contribution after clicking on the referral link. If they visit other pages or websites or leave and come back to the campaign later to contribute, their contribution will not be counted as a referral.

REFERRAL CONTEST STIPULATIONS:

Whichever contributors generates the most traffic will win a prize, from the prize pool. Where they will choose which item that they want at the end of the campaign (first come, first serve). Items are limited. 
REFERRERS MUST ALSO BE BACKERS/CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS CAMPAIGN!

It was a pleasure to talk with Carlos about his inspiration for DragonMasters, character design and worldbuilding, the struggles of indie creators, creative collaboration with fans, DIY action figure production and much more!</p><p>JR: How long have you been creating comics, and what made you want to start? What’s the Wicked Comics origin story?</p><p>CF: I started about three years ago. The plan was to stay one hundred percent independent and to try to create new ideas and stories. If you look at the market, lot of the books out there are the same characters doing same things over and over. I want to create new stories, new ideas and new characters. I see a lot of people who do the same superhero-type invincible hero. I just feel like there’s always room for different ideas.</p><p>JR: You are credited with character design, story and art on DragonMasters. Do you collaborate with anyone on the Wicked Comics titles, or are you a one man show?</p><p>CF: It’s pretty much a one man show. I do all the writing, developing the characters, artwork and coloring. That’s why sometimes it takes me a little bit longer to launch a title.</p><p>JR: I’m finding out when I interview creators that music often plays a huge inspirational role in their work and creative process. You’ve released three books up to this point: the first, ClownMan, about a clown vigilante, the second, KillSwitch, about a criminal who becomes a super soldier, and your most recent, DragonMasters, featuring a world of wizards, knights, barbarians, magic and dragons as well as advanced technology. Out of personal interest I have to ask: do you listen to hard rock or heavy metal music?</p><p>CF: It depends on the title. Definitely music plays a role in each story. As far as ClownMan, I see it as a dark underground world. The type of music that fits with it is almost like industrial rock because ClownMan was inspired by The Crow and the Joker. The same goes for KillSwitch. The music is more of a scientific or futuristic soundtrack. DragonMasters is definitely fantasy. I listen to a lot of fantasy type music in the vein of Conan, Masters of the Universe and Dungeons &amp; Dragons. A lot of that played a role. It’s fantasy music like instrumentals. For DragonMasters I type in fantasy music and try to put myself in that world.</p><p>JR: So you search by music theme?</p><p>CF: Yeah, for ClownMan I’ll search for creepy carnival music. It helps a bit if you’re running into a blank, you hear something and it might spark a new idea.</p><p>JR: ClownMan and KillSwitch are both dark, gritty superheroes. DragonMasters is your new book. What made you want to depart from this theme to do a heroic fantasy book? </p><p>CF: I didn’t want to be typecast as always doing the same thing, or want people to think, “Oh this guy’s a dark person.” As far as the company goes, I want as much variety as I can get. DragonMasters is a fantasy book that’s not your standard comic book character. In the future, you’ll see I even have a cartoon character. So there will be a variety of books, not just superhero titles.</p><p>JR: So that allows you to find the audience for Wicked Comics?</p><p>CF: Right! It helps get a variety of people interested. For a single book, maybe people with certain interests will be drawn to that story. A good variety of ideas and stories will help to bring a bigger audience to my creations.</p><p>JR: Please tell readers a bit about the world of DragonMasters and how the book came to be.</p><p>CF: It was always in the back of my head. I wanted to create this fantasy land. The story takes place in a world called Dragonia. How it came about is that I’m really big into Star Wars. I always liked that conflict between the Jedi and Sith. This is my twist on that but in a world of dragons. There are even crazy backstories for each Slayer and each Master. You can keep going into this world and finding out more about each character.</p><p> </p><p>JR: Is this title going to be an ongoing series?</p><p>CF: Yeah, that’s the plan. You’re gonna see certain relationships between the Masters and the Slayers in the upcoming issues. You’ll see things between them that you never saw coming. There will be plenty of twists and turns in the story. There’s also going to be all kinds of races like cat warriors. So yeah, all kinds of stuff!</p><p>JR: One aspect I think fans will be excited about is the mix of technology and fantasy in DragonMasters. What made you decide to incorporate science fiction technology?</p><p>CF: I wanted to throw a curve to the fantasy world. Take Conan the Barbarian for example, it’s strictly fantasy-based. But in DragonMasters, the Masters have their sanctuary called the Lair. When they bring in new Masters, they train them with a hologram dragon. They can practice and become better dragon slayers. So that’s the idea – to combine the technology aspect with swords and fantasy. It adds a different feeling to the story. Maybe there will be battles with Slayers armed with high tech guns but also with swords. There might also be special technology to capture dragons.</p><p>JR: One of the most interesting, unique and original characters in DragonMasters is the Emperor. What can you tell readers about him?</p><p>CF: See the design of that character? See how he runs off of tubes that go into his body? He runs off of the blood of dead kings. He’s a ten thousand-year-old dragon slayer. But because he has that blood running through him, he remains young and powerful. It all has to do with rejuvenation. The blood that flows through him gives him his power. The dark side of the Dragon Eye also gives him power. The Dragon Eye in Dragonia is like a religious symbol that has powers. If you’re an evil dark person, it gives you dark power. If you’re a good person, you use the good side of the Dragon Eye. It’s almost like something you channel.</p><p> </p><p>JR: The Kickstarter campaign for DragonMasters #1 is currently live. What would you say to anyone undecided or on the fence about backing the Kickstarter to convince them to get on board?</p><p>CF: For each comic I release, I try to do a Kickstarter for it. I haven’t funded through Kickstarter, but people purchase the books on their own. I would say to them that DragonMasters is unique and different. It brings a new world of fantasy to readers. It combines technology, dragons and dragon slaying. There’s tons of battles, and there’s going to be many characters each with their own identity and backstory. It’s going to be something that I feel like will continue for a long time, somewhat similar to Masters of the Universe.</p><p>JR: Many times it’s difficult for indie creators to complete books and bring them to market. They have to face a number of obstacles including getting enough time to work on them outside their day jobs, family obligations, problems with printers, finding the money to pay for print runs and just the motivation to keep going and finish the project. Are there any challenges you’ve faced on the road to bringing DragonMasters and the other Wicked Comics books to fans?</p><p>CF: Oh absolutely! Definitely motivation. What motivates someone to keep on going? Maybe they’re not seeing a lot of outcome from it, or not really making making a good living from it. To me it’s the fans. They write to me and say, “I’m looking forward to this title. When’s this title coming out?” That’s what keeps me going. Time is also hard to find sometimes. I spend so many hours working on titles. It’s endless. The hardest part is developing the story and coming up with the designs of the characters. A lot of times the first design of a character isn’t the finalized design. It takes me a long time to finally get the right look for each character.</p><p>JR: You’ve had great success in soliciting fan art of Wicked Comics characters from the artist community. I was listening to another interview where you said that some of the art you received even inspired you as you were creating later iterations of the ClownMan character. Can you tell readers more about this?</p><p>CF: Absolutely! The first iteration of ClownMan was almost like a cartoon, not how you see him now. I got some fan art from from an artist named Frank Soto. He drew ClownMan realistically, almost like The Crow. With that I kept on redesigning. A lot of the changes I make come directly from the fans. The public – they’re the ones who dictate whether the character is going to be successful or not. I always listen to what they say.</p><p>JR: Can you tell readers a bit more about what you’re doing with toy design and the Wicked Comics action figures?</p><p>CF: A friend of mine who I met on Facebook was getting into making molds at home. We thought it would be a cool idea to bring these creations to life as figures. We brainstormed and came up with different ideas on how to do it. I sculpt the figure from clay, and then I make a mold out of it. I pour plastic into the mold, and then I paint them all by hand. I make the packaging, design it on the computer, print it and glue it on the boards.</p><p>JR: So you’re doing all the sculpting, mold making and casting for the toys as well as creating the comics? How do you have any time to sleep!?</p><p>CF: Yeah, every day there’s something to do. I also do all the trailers. I do all the mail-outs. So I basically do everything.</p><p>JR: Many comic shops have a special section for local and indie comics. I think it would be awesome to see a Wicked Comics mini-display featuring your books and action figures together so customers see the whole immersive world you’ve created. Have you thought about getting any shops interested in something like this?</p><p>CF: You know, actually I did. I went to two different shops here in Florida, but they weren’t too inviting. This was when I released ClownMan. They seemed disinterested. But it’s part of the whole thing. I know that success doesn’t come overnight.</p><p>JR: Maybe now that you have a few more titles under your belt as well as the figures, shops will start to take notice and show some interest. All the struggling shops out there need something local, different and unique to pull in customers and differentiate themselves from the competition. Are you doing any comic book shop signings or tabling at convention artist alleys to promote and sell Wicked Comics?</p><p>CF: I did one comic con so far. It was Hero Hype in Miami. It was a small con, but I sold a few books there. A few of the fans who bought books there, I still keep in contact with them. One guy comes to my house every time I release a new book! But I was planning on doing a convention in April called Ultracon. So you might see me there with ClownMan, KillSwitch and DragonMasters.</p><p>JR: Where can fans find out more about Wicked Comics and DragonMasters online?</p><p>CF: Just Go to <a href=""http://www.wicked-comics.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.wicked-comics.com</a>. The site has a comics section and right now I have DragonMasters on pre-order. I haven’t gotten the print copies yet, but I should have them soon. You can purchase the pdf of DragonMasters. You can also purchase pdfs and print comics of KillSwitch and ClownMan. I also have a section for the figures.</p><p>JR: Are you linking the DragonMasters pre-order to the KickStarter now?</p><p>CF: On the bottom, I always have the current Kickstarter that’s live. I do the Kickstarters more for people to check out the company and the characters. You have to get your name out there. I use it as a way just so people can see my artwork and stories.</p><p>JR: Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with me today!

ComicFigures Map Of DragoniaMind Meld With DragonMasters’ Carlos Farias!One Man Show: Carlos Farias Releases DragonMasters Through Wicked ComicsCarlos Farias is the creator, writer and artist of the recently released DragonMasters #1. DragonMasters is the third title he’s self-published through his company, Wicked Comics. It was a pleasure to talk with Carlos about his inspiration for DragonMasters, character design and worldbuilding, the struggles of indie creators, creative collaboration with fans, DIY action figure production and much more!JR: How long have you been creating comics, and what made you want to start? What’s the Wicked Comics origin story?CF: I started about three years ago. The plan was to stay one hundred percent independent and to try to create new ideas and stories. If you look at the market, lot of the books out there are the same characters doing same things over and over. I want to create new stories, new ideas and new characters. I see a lot of people who do the same superhero-type invincible hero. I just feel like there’s always room for different ideas.JR: You are credited with character design, story and art on DragonMasters. Do you collaborate with anyone on the Wicked Comics titles, or are you a one man show?CF: It’s pretty much a one man show. I do all the writing, developing the characters, artwork and coloring. That’s why sometimes it takes me a little bit longer to launch a title.JR: I’m finding out when I interview creators that music often plays a huge inspirational role in their work and creative process. You’ve released three books up to this point: the first, ClownMan, about a clown vigilante, the second, KillSwitch, about a criminal who becomes a super soldier, and your most recent, DragonMasters, featuring a world of wizards, knights, barbarians, magic and dragons as well as advanced technology. Out of personal interest I have to ask: do you listen to hard rock or heavy metal music?CF: It depends on the title. Definitely music plays a role in each story. As far as ClownMan, I see it as a dark underground world. The type of music that fits with it is almost like industrial rock because ClownMan was inspired by The Crow and the Joker. The same goes for KillSwitch. The music is more of a scientific or futuristic soundtrack. DragonMasters is definitely fantasy. I listen to a lot of fantasy type music in the vein of Conan, Masters of the Universe and Dungeons & Dragons. A lot of that played a role. It’s fantasy music like instrumentals. For DragonMasters I type in fantasy music and try to put myself in that world.JR: So you search by music theme?CF: Yeah, for ClownMan I’ll search for creepy carnival music. It helps a bit if you’re running into a blank, you hear something and it might spark a new idea.JR: ClownMan and KillSwitch are both dark, gritty superheroes. DragonMasters is your new book. What made you want to depart from this theme to do a heroic fantasy book? CF: I didn’t want to be typecast as always doing the same thing, or want people to think, “Oh this guy’s a dark person.” As far as the company goes, I want as much variety as I can get. DragonMasters is a fantasy book that’s not your standard comic book character. In the future, you’ll see I even have a cartoon character. So there will be a variety of books, not just superhero titles.JR: So that allows you to find the audience for Wicked Comics?CF: Right! It helps get a variety of people interested. For a single book, maybe people with certain interests will be drawn to that story. A good variety of ideas and stories will help to bring a bigger audience to my creations.JR: Please tell readers a bit about the world of DragonMasters and how the book came to be.CF: It was always in the back of my head. I wanted to create this fantasy land. The story takes place in a world called Dragonia. How it came about is that I’m really big into Star Wars.

We are very proud to offer our readers a variety of different perks on top of the standard digital and physical copies. This includes a variant cover drawn by co-creator and interior artist Elie Bongrand and colored by the amazing Michael Sanders along with another drawn by Marcelo Simonetti and colored by our incredible interior colorist, Ibrahim Aydin who will be joining us for the rest of the series.  These variant copies will also include an additional 16 pages showing a behind the scenes look at the progression of Cowboy Bob and an art gallery.
 

 
We're also happy to announce that with each campaign we will offer a new t-shirt and hoodie with an original Cowboy Bob design exclusive to each campaign and issue. These shirts are 50 percent polyester and 50 percent cotton, so expect virtually no shrinkage. For those who need something to keep them warmer,  we also have hooded sweatshirts. We offer the same design on a neon green 100 percent polyester shirt. 
 

 
We also offer an 18"" x 24"" poster by Marcelo Simonetti that we like to call our ""Epic Irish Potato Western Poster"", parodying the classic spaghetti western posters from the '60s and '70s.
 

 

 
STRETCH GOALS
 
- $7,500: a Cowboy Bob bookmark will be added to every book.
- $10,000: every print backer will also get a bookplate with their book
- $12,500: we'll add trading cards to the perks
- $15,000: we will be able to have our book translated in Spanish and two other languages based on popularity
OUR TEAM:
Michael Sanders is a colorist who's become more and more well known and for good reason, he's incredible. He's worked on the following... Hawk issue 1, Lathesome Tales issue 2,3,4, Splitface issue 1, Luchador issue 1, X-Liefields issue 1, Harla - Tales from the Udderverse Vol. 1
Marcelo Simonetti is a very talented and versatile artist from Uraguay. He's done a great job on both our ""epic Irish potato western"" movie poster and one of our variant covers. You can find his galleries on Guru and at his Instagram @simonetti.marcelo_art .
 
 

RISKS AND CHALLENGES
 
Unlike other teams, we can't claim to have extensive experience in publishing comics. It is indeed our first common operation and we're eager to deliver to you the best product we can create. Some campaigns focus on advanced machinery or breakthrough technologies and therefore imply a strong level of uncertainty. the only risk our campaign knows regards our ability to avoid delays. However, we have saved room for unexpected events to make sure your book is delivered in due time.",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>The Story</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>What do you do when you’re a pro football franchise, THE MAINE LOBSTERS, and have lost 32 games in a row? The 32 losses are hard for the fans to take, especially when your quarterback is Caleb O’Rourke, holder of every collegiate quarterback record before being a first-round lottery pick to the pros and The Lobsters. O’Rourke was considered the finest quarterback in a generation, so why the 32 losses? Answer: the line defending O’Rourke consisted of the most inept, bungling idiots ever to play football. In desperation, the team decides to buy up a school of gargantuan Sumos and try turning them into offensive linemen, protecting the precious O’Rourke. Easier said than done since Yama, the greatest of the Sumos, demands, if he will play for THE LOBSTERS, that his girlfriends Fumiko and Yoko, members of the <i>Purple Lotus Blossom Society of Lady Sumo Wrestlers</i>, accompany him to Maine to be incorporated into The Lobsters lovely, graceful cheerleading squad – The Lobsterettes. A PROBLEM! Fumiko and Yoko’s athleticism (flinging their arms, legs and bodies violently about) brings untold physical and mental grief to the delicate Lobsterettes.</p>
<p>What do you do when your Sumo linemen are initially at a complete loss as to the finesse moves of an offensive lineman? Maybe to bring them to their ferocious potential, you psych them by causing them to believe that opposing linemen have lustful intentions upon the Sumos’ mothers, including putting their drooling lips upon the Sumo mothers’ sweet cheeks. Not a happy result for opposing linemen.</p>
<p>And what do you do if you’re Yama, the greatest Sumo, and you mistakenly believe that quarterback O’Rourke is messing around with your Lotus Blossom Sumo girlfriends? Maybe if you’re Yama, on the very first play of the big game, you fling your enormous body into the air and land on the unsuspecting O’Rourke. A disaster for O’Rourke, and for The Lobsters.</p>
<p>And what do you do on the very last play of the big game, when The Lobsters are losing by one TD, and all seems lost? Maybe, if you’re a Sumo lineman, you strip off your stupid pro football uniform, throw your helmet to the ground, take stock of your Sumo heritage, and clad only in your skimpy loincloth go for the win <i>– the SUMO WAY.</i></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello everyone, I am Tony Kittrell and I want to thank you for looking at my campaign.  Let me introduce myself and tell you a little about me.  I am a Husband, Father, Grandfather and 20 year Career Firefighter &amp; Paramedic.  I am also the Head Writer and Publisher of Advent Comics, a small Indie Comics Publisher, for the last nine years.  You can find my comics on Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, Comics Plus, Comixology, DriveThruComics.com, IndyPlanet, iTunes, Kindle, Nook and select comic shops worldwide.</p>
<p>When I first started, I had decided that I wanted to put out comics that were entertaining and fun that reminded me of the comic books that I grew up reading as a kid.  DARK MATTER: RISE OF THE LEXICONS is one of those books.  Briefly put, this book is a mix of fantasy, science fiction and superhero elements that makes you think this is what it would look like if Game of Thrones meets Star Wars with Westworld thrown in.  This campaign will allow us to open this book up to people who do not know about us and also allow for a bigger print run of the book.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As I stated, we are not trying to break the bank but raise awareness of our comic and have set a $600 minimum goal.  The funds will go towards the printing costs that I will be coming out of my pocket with and distribution of the book.  If we get to our funding goal, that would be great.  If we get pass that amount that would be great too! </p>
<p>With that in mind, we have some pretty fun perks for you if you choose to back us. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If you like your comics to have good stories, great art and to be all around fun reads, then this is the comic that you should back!  While this is our first Indiegogo campaign, it is not our first comic book release nor crowdfunding effort.  We have been doing this successfully for close to ten years now.  We want to make great comics for our fans, old &amp; new. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The book is completed so the only risk comes from the Printer.  We just have to pay for more copies, the rewards and getting you your copies.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know it's summertime with bills mounting, kids out of school and just life in general happening so there is not a lot of money to go around.  But if you are able to, support the campaign, pick up a great comic and escape from reality for awhile.  If you can't support with cold hard cash, use the Indiegogo share tools to tell all of your friends about the campaign and get them to support the book.  That works just as well in my book.</p>
<p>I also want everyone to feel free to contact, interact with me and send any questions you have about the campaign my way.  As we move forward, I welcome getting to know you all just as you get to know about myself &amp; the team.</p>
<p>With your help, we will be successful!  Thank you for your support in advance!</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">50 people from all over the world, £1000, and Daniel's comic ""The Final"" is ready for publication! Can you believe that ? But now we still have the most important aim, and you can become the one, thanks to whom, it will be achieved!</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p>First of all, let’s tell everyone who is not yet familiar with our project. The comic ""The Final"" is dedicated to Daniel's grandfather, Ismail Akhmedjanov, who was affected by a rare form of <strong>thyroid cancer</strong>. He got this type of cancer from exposure to radiation. When he was in the military, he was sent to build the <strong>Baikonur Cosmodrome</strong> in Kazakhstan to help launch the spacecraft that led <strong>Yuri Gagarin</strong> to go to space! Unfortunately great achievements came with a price...Ismail passed away 3 years before Daniel’s birth.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>One of the main tasks of our public project “The Final” was the publication of a comic book, which we, thanks to the support of the public, successfully coped with! Now, thanks to <strong>50 heroes</strong>, the whole world will be able to get acquainted with the amazing and exciting comic strip by Daniel Akhmed! And that proves the fact that everything is possible only with joint efforts! BUT still our main mission is to hold a series of charity events to <strong>distribute comics and donate funds to cancer centres in need</strong>. This is why we created the third part of the campaign to gain at least<strong> £1000</strong> so that as many organisations fighting against cancer as possible could get the help they need.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>And now you have a wonderful chance to do a good deed not only by supporting our campaign, but also by <strong>offering </strong>us an organisation working with cancer patients, which we can include in our <strong>charity tour</strong>. And then, thanks to your gesture of kindness, people with serious illnesses will be able to gain more strength to fight evil ailments, and what is equally important, to find reasons to continue the fight!</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>For us, as well as for Daniel, the support of each person is very important, which is why, as a gratitude, the names of everyone who supported or will support the project will be indicated on the pages of the comic <strong>(but there are other marvelous perks as well!!!)</strong>. We insist on the thing, that the name of<strong> every person</strong> who contributes in the development of the life of the whole world, deserves to be marked in history. And in our case, the history, is the comic ""The Final"", which will become a legacy we are leaving to our descendants.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>_______________________________________________________________________________</strong></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">50 человек со всего мира и 1000 фунтов стерлингов - и комикс Даниеля “The Final” готов к изданию! Представляете? Мы все - большие молодцы, это точно! Но теперь перед нами стоит самая важная цель, а Вы сможете стать тем, благодаря кому она будет достигнута!</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Для начала хотелось бы рассказать всем, кто еще не знаком с нашим проектом, его историю. Комикс «The Final» посвящен <strong>дедушке Даниеля</strong>, Исмаилу Ахмеджанову, который заболел редкой формой <strong>рака щитовидной железы</strong>. Причиной этой болезни стало радиационное излучение, которое поразило его во времена службы в армии. Тогда Исмаил был отправлен на строительство космодрома <strong>Байконур в Казахстане</strong>, чтобы помочь запустить космический корабль, доставивший<strong> Юрия Гагарина в космос!</strong> Но, к сожалению, великие достижения всегда даются большой ценой... Исмаил Ахмеджанов умер за 3 года до рождения внука из-за развившегося недуга. </p>
<h3>Чего Мы хотим</h3>
<p>Одной из задач общественного проекта “The Final” было издание комикса, с чем мы, благодаря поддержке общественности, благополучно справились! Теперь благодаря <strong>50 героям</strong> весь мир сможет познакомиться с удивительным и захватывающим комиксом Даниеля Ахмеда! Это ли не доказательство того, что все возможно только при <strong>совместных усилиях</strong>? НО нашей <strong>главной миссией</strong> является проведение серии благотворительных акций <strong>по распространению комикса и по пожертвованиям средств</strong> в нуждающиеся онкологические центры. Именно поэтому мы и создали третью часть кампании для сбора как минимум <strong>1000 фунтов</strong>, чтобы как можно больше организаций, борющихся с раком, получило необходимую помощь.</p>
<h3>Дополнительные Способы Поддержки</h3>
<p>И вот сейчас у Вас есть замечательнейшая возможность сделать доброе дело не только поддержав нашу кампанию, но и предложив нам организацию, работающую с онкобольными, которую мы сможем включить в наш тур благотворительности. И тогда, благодаря Вашему жесту добра, люди с тяжелыми заболеваниями смогут обрести больше сил на борьбу со злыми недугами, а что еще не менее важно, обрести причины для продолжения борьбы!</p>
<h3>Что Получите Вы</h3>
<p>Для нас, как и для Даниеля, очень важна поддержка каждого человека, именно поэтому в качестве благодарности имена всех, кто поддержал или поддержит проект, будут указаны на страницах комикса <strong>(но не забывайте про готовые уникальные пакеты с подарками!)</strong>. Мы уверены, что имя каждого человека, вкладывающего в улучшение жизни всей страны, а то и мира, достойно того, чтобы <strong>быть сохраненным в истории.</strong> И в нашем случае, история - это комикс “The Final”, который останется в качестве нашего наследия нашим потомкам.</p>

<p>    So a few years ago I started a dream. That dream was to create a series of books based on Mythology and Religion. To create an epic tale of both action and horror in the vein of a <strong>Tolkien </strong>epic mixed with <strong>Lovecraftian</strong> horror.  It's taken both time and work to come up with<strong><i> Into Darkness </i></strong>and I'm not only proud of where it is  but also where I know it's going.  It will be an ongoing series based around the end times and what it would truly be like if Hell was unleashed on Earth.  My name is Mark Taub and I thank you for taking the time to explore my passion.    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1578265412/ff82kcbp4makw8axeakm.jpg"" src=""""/>                    </p>

<p>     The book is already complete and just needs the funding to get it out into the wild.  It is two hundred pages long in black and white and will be in trade paperback format. Into Darkness deals with adult themes and is for mature readers. I consider it an R rated Graphic Novel .</p>

Set in exotic locations including East Africa and India, it is the antihero’s journey, fraught with all the delightful perils of existence, where tyranny lurks around every turn and strange forces loom just beyond the boundaries of normal perception. It’s a tragically funny romp where no one can ever be safe from others, or themselves, for that matter, and you will find that ultimately NOTHING is more offensive than existence… What's the story line?When a would-be sorcerer attempts to fix his past by reclaiming an ancient artifact with a mysterious power, he unleashes a creature so preposterous it will bring into question the very fabric of BEING.

<p>Vorremmo iniziare dicendo che non abbiamo assolutamente nulla contro editori italiani o stranieri, amiamo avere alle nostre spalle una casa editrice a cui affidare i nostri progetti, ma questa volta il nostro progetto lo vorremmo affidare direttamente ai lettori, vorremmo essere in grado di seguire la creazione di Senzombra in ogni singolo particolare e senza nessun compromesso e, per farlo, dobbiamo convincervi... uno alla volta. E' la stessa cosa che Michele ha fatto tante volte con l'autoproduzione, ma in questo caso il progetto era troppo ambizioso per quel mezzo (leggi: Michele e Marco non avevano abbastanza soldi) e il crowdfunding ci è sembrata la soluzione migliore. Sarà un lungo viaggio, ma speriamo che, se siete arrivati fino qui in fondo, vi sarete anche appassionati al nostro giovane Tristan, scalpitiate come noi per leggere l'albo e vogliate e deciderete di investire nella nostra storia.</p>

<h3>A cosa ci servono i 28.000 euro</h3>I 28.000 euro che vi stiamo chiedendo per finanziare il progetto compriranno in questo modo le spese della produzione di albo e perk:<p>15.000 euro per sceneggiatore, disegnatore (che avrà anche il ruolo di colorista in questo caso) e grafico.</p>
<p>6000 euro la stampa dei volumi.<br/></p>
<p>3000 euro i costi della produzione dei perk.<br/></p>
<p>3000 euro sono le varie tasse e fee che ci impongono indiegogo e paypal.</p>
<p>1000 i costi delle varie sponsorizzazioni sui social.</p>

<h3>Collaboratori e ringraziamenti</h3>
<div>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Fabrizio Verrocchi ha realizzato lo splendido logo di Senzombra  e il progetto grafico dell'intero albo. Maria Rosaria Giampaglia che sta seguendo la campagna e ci ha fornito i suoi preziosissimi servizi come ufficio stampa. Salvatore de Chirico che ci aiuta nella gestione delle sponsorizzazioni. Fabio Listrani ci ha aiutato nella visualizzazione dei perk. Daniele di Nicuolo e Walter Baiamonte hanno disegnato e colorato l'intro/tutorial. E la lista verrà aggiornata perchè abbiamo ancora qualchesorpresa per voi...</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Infine Senzombra, come tutti gli albi creati in Uno Studio in Rosso (il collettivo romano in cui lavora Michele) deve molto alla collaborazione tra i membri dello studio, quindi ringraziamo per i consigli e l'aiuto: Roberto Recchioni, Riccardo Torti, Giovanni Masi, Giulio Antonio Gualtieri, Federico Rossi Edrighi, Mauro Uzzeo e Roberto Cirincione. E infine ringraziamo tutti voi che parteciperete al crowdfunding e che ci aiuterete a realizzare questo nostro piccolo sogno. Grazie a tutti.</span></p>

Senzombra è un fumetto che nasce dalla mente di Michele Monteleone, sceneggiatore di Dylan Dog e Orfani per la Sergio Bonelli Editore e dalla matita di Marco Matrone, straordinario esordiente nel mondo dei fumetti. 




Con questo crowdfunding Michele e Marco vogliono coinvolgervi nella realizzazione di un volume da 80 tavole, cartonato, a colori, in formato francese (22x29,5cm). Il vostro aiuto nel finanziare la campagna sarà vitale per realizzare l'albo a fumetti e vi garantirà in ritorno una copia di Senzombra. Oltre al fumetto saranno disponibili un sacco di altri meravigliosi gadget che vi ricompenseranno per essere stati i primi a credere in Senzombra... ma cosa sono questi senzombra?
La storia
La terra dei senzombra è molto simile alla nostra, infatti nel mondo in cui si ambienta la nostra storia, esistono macchine, scuole, supermercati, smartphone, console, fumetti, strade, palazzi, semafori e... MOSTRI!
Tutti sanno dell'esistenza dei mostri e tutti sanno che gli unici che li cacciano sono i senzombra.
Tristan, il nostro protagonista, è un senzombra.






Entrambi i creatori del fumetto, da bambini, avevano paura che un mostro, viscido e ghignante, li aspettasse nell'ombra sotto al loro letto. Michele, ancora oggi, ammette candidamente che  prima di stendersi dà ancora un calcetto nel vuoto fra pavimento e doghe di legno.  

Per sicurezza. 
Non si sa mai. 
Marco scuote la testa al solo pensiero di un ventinovenne, alto un metro e ottanta, che ha paura dell'uomo nero, ma ormai è troppo affezionato al progetto per scappare a gambe levate...
Al contrario di Michele, Tristan, che come vi dicevamo è il protagonista della nostra storia, non ha nessuna paura che un mostro si nasconda sotto al suo letto, anche perché cacciare mostri è il suo lavoro. 

Tristan
è un ragazzino sui quindici anni, ha un'insana passione per il ramen
istantaneo, una forte dipendenza dai giochi per smartphone e un divorante interesse per i fumetti. Ma lasciate che ve lo presenti:
Speriamo che la spiegazione sia abbastanza chiara, in caso non lo fosse, daremo la colpa a Daniele Di Nicuolo e Walter Baiamonte che hanno rispettivamente illustrato e colorato questo breve tutorial scritto da Michele. A parte gli scherzi, li ringraziamo tanto per averci aiutato a spiegarvi qualcosa del mondo di Senzombra.

    Perché il crowdfunding





Vorremmo iniziare dicendo che non abbiamo assolutamente nulla contro editori italiani o stranieri, amiamo avere alle nostre spalle una casa editrice a cui affidare i nostri progetti, ma questa volta il nostro progetto lo vorremmo affidare direttamente ai lettori, vorremmo essere in grado di seguire la creazione di Senzombra in ogni singolo particolare e senza nessun compromesso e, per farlo, dobbiamo convincervi... uno alla volta. E' la stessa cosa che Michele ha fatto tante volte con l'autoproduzione, ma in questo caso il progetto era troppo ambizioso per quel mezzo (leggi: Michele e Marco non avevano abbastanza soldi) e il crowdfunding ci è sembrata la soluzione migliore. Sarà un lungo viaggio, ma speriamo che, se siete arrivati fino qui in fondo, vi sarete anche appassionati al nostro giovane Tristan, scalpitiate come noi per leggere l'albo e vogliate e deciderete di investire nella nostra storia.

    Altri modi con cui aiutarci





Se siete entusiasti del progetto la metà di quanto lo siamo noi, aiutateci a diffondere il verbo di Senzombra, per farlo potete condividere questa pagina copiando e incollando il seguente link - https://igg.me/at/senzombra - su ogni social possibile e immaginabile, oppure potete seguire la nostra pagina facebook cliccando sul seguente link Facebook, o ancora stampandovi la pagina del progetto e facendo volantinaggio agli angoli della strada gridando che l'apocalisse sta arrivando... scherziamo, eh. Forse...

A cosa ci servono i 28.000 euroI 28.000 euro che vi stiamo chiedendo per finanziare il progetto compriranno in questo modo le spese della produzione di albo e perk:15.000 euro per sceneggiatore, disegnatore (che avrà anche il ruolo di colorista in questo caso) e grafico.
6000 euro la stampa dei volumi.
3000 euro i costi della produzione dei perk.
3000 euro sono le varie tasse e fee che ci impongono indiegogo e paypal.
1000 i costi delle varie sponsorizzazioni sui social.

Collaboratori e ringraziamenti

Fabrizio Verrocchi ha realizzato lo splendido logo di Senzombra  e il progetto grafico dell'intero albo. Maria Rosaria Giampaglia che sta seguendo la campagna e ci ha fornito i suoi preziosissimi servizi come ufficio stampa. Salvatore de Chirico che ci aiuta nella gestione delle sponsorizzazioni. Fabio Listrani ci ha aiutato nella visualizzazione dei perk. Daniele di Nicuolo e Walter Baiamonte hanno disegnato e colorato l'intro/tutorial. E la lista verrà aggiornata perchè abbiamo ancora qualchesorpresa per voi...
Infine Senzombra, come tutti gli albi creati in Uno Studio in Rosso (il collettivo romano in cui lavora Michele) deve molto alla collaborazione tra i membri dello studio, quindi ringraziamo per i consigli e l'aiuto: Roberto Recchioni, Riccardo Torti, Giovanni Masi, Giulio Antonio Gualtieri, Federico Rossi Edrighi, Mauro Uzzeo e Roberto Cirincione. E infine ringraziamo tutti voi che parteciperete al crowdfunding e che ci aiuterete a realizzare questo nostro piccolo sogno. Grazie a tutti.",16.0,2,"1 Campaign

<h3>Greetings, Boils &amp; Ghouls!</h3>
<p>My name is Ben. I'm a cartoonist  and from Delaware. Also I am a Trashmonger.</p>
<p>I want to print a large run of the first issue of my horror comic, <strong><u><i>MILLIE</i></u></strong>. This, consisting of two episodes over 16 pages, is ready to print.</p>
<p><u><i><strong>MILLIE</strong></i></u> centers around a girl (<strong><i><u>MILLIE</u></i></strong>) whose cruelty, sharp tongue and biting wit have made it difficult to get anywhere in the dating scene... and she is beginning to lose hope for ever finding Mr. Right.

Our goal is to create content that everyone can enjoy. Our team is made up of individuals with vast experience in their fields. Storytellers, artists, shippers, programmers, customer services. All of this experience coming together under one banner to bring you a high-quality book. Packaged and shipped under the supervision of a 30-year veteran in the industry. This is why we use Gemini mailers. We will keep you abreast of all phases of this project as we move forward. Full transparency is important to us. So let's start right now...
We will update you at least once a week. Even if that update is the same as the last. (No canned responses) Keeping you informed is important and vital for us to build trust with our backers.
Questions posted to the comments section or sent through the ""ask a question"" link will be answered in a judicious manner!
Currently, the script for OFFWORLDER is written. The first 25 pages are penciled and inked. Several pages have already been lettered and colored. This makes OFFWORLDER nearly half complete!

<p>Ever since I was trained by my father, with drawings of stickmans and mannequin frameworks, I knew that it was the thing I wanted to do for the rest of my life, somewhere I belong. So I pushed for it. I strived to be my very best, even as people discouraged and turned back on me. I started doing fanarts, giving every piece everything I got and then I started doing commissions, character designs and arts that people wanna see and keep for themselves. And after that, I was introduced to comic making and met more and more artists as I went on, as I went to know them more, I saw different stories, different experiences, different hardships. This helped me understand the arts more, this helped me be the artist I am today. </p>
<p>Ever since then I have taken my arts way more seriously, never missing the opportunity to learn more and do more! Until now, even as I am a professional artist, I still continue to learn and test and hone my skills to the maximum extent! ^_^<br/><br/>Along with that, came the yearning to create something more.

<h2>What is This &amp; Why Should I Back it?</h2>
<p>  My name is C.B Smallwood &amp; I am the creator of Wildcat. Wildcat is a character that I created sometime around the early '90s. I guess it shows and it should! A fan of many of the comics being put out at that time from Marvel, DC, Malibu, &amp; Image (to name a few) I created a character that reflected the fun &amp; the energy of that time from both comics &amp; film!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566023008/smfihntxfzeffr4vdbi8.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I drew inspiration from just about anything John Carpenter directed such as Escape from New York or anything from Troma Films such as The Toxic Avenger. I was influenced by other fine works such as Alien, Aliens, Army of Darkness, The Blues Brothers, Full Metal Jacket, Rambo, Raising Arizona, Exorcist 3...etc. Everything from horror, thriller, mystery, grindhouse to even Spaghetti Westerns! This comic is a love letter to all the great stuff in the '70s, '80s, &amp; '90s that kids today missed out on. </p>
<p>It has been my dream to draw &amp; make comics for a living. After growing tired of trying to break into the comics industry I decided to dust Wildcat off and pave my own way! Back in 2017, after hopping to one job to another (and the birth of my son) it was time to go all-in or nothing! Written, drawn, inked, colored, &amp; lettered by me, I had to learn to do everything. It was not easy. Sometimes it felt like there was no light at the end of the tunnel, but here we are on IndieGoGo!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>So Why Should You Back this Book? </strong></h3>
<p>If you want a comic that is fun, thrilling and leaves you excited for more than look no further! If you want to support a comic creator who values your business, and your fandom then I am your man! Your support is an investment in the character Wildcat, in me as a comics creator, and in this new company that puts readers FIRST. No agendas, no politics, no excuses, just comics the way you like them, BIG, BOLD, FUN, &amp; DANGEROUS!</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Hello.  I am Brian Blair, a horror artist best known for creating my company <a href=""http://pumpkinpulp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pumpkin Pulp</a>.  I have created numerous masks and props for the Horror and Halloween industry.  After years of planning and talking about doing my own horror stories it is finally time.  I am ready to create a new series of horror filled comics called Tales From The Pulp.  With your support, the first issue called Pork Chop will finally become a reality!</p>
<h3>How it all started</h3>
<p><font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">​I have been an artist my whole life and grew up reading comics like The House of Mystery, Chamber of Chills, Swamp Thing, and Creepy Magazine.  I spent countless hours creating my own stories and drawing horror filled artwork while watching late night horror movies.  I then graduated from Ball State University with a bachelor's degree in Fine Arts.  I later started my venture into the haunt industry when I formed Pumpkin Pulp in 2006 and began making masks and props.  The masks and props began getting world wide attention and are now collected around the globe.  I have always had a dream to take it to the next level and turn my creations into actual characters.  Creating a character and story to go with the mask is a dream come true. </span></font></p>
<h3>The Comic</h3>
<p><font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The first </span>story I have created is called Pork Chop.  It is about a young farm girl who grows up in an abusive relationship with her family.  She finds solitude in raising a young piglet she names Pork Chop.  The pig grows up and is the only peace in life the young girl knows. During a fiery night at the house, the father goes on a rampage and slaughters the pig in spite of his daughter.  This sends the daughter, who was already on the edge of sanity, on a violent bloody rage where there is no return.  </font></p>

<p>   Cruel kings rule the world with the church supporting their oppressive regimes. As if the above were not enough, a blood disease was casted upon mankind like a plague, making blood so valuable that it's being used as currency.</p>
<p>   Our story focuses on Metropolis 1 and Oulrik, son of the fallen rebel Borin. Follow the journey of Oulrik and his companions in their quest to liberate Metropolis 1 from the evil rule of king Brom and bring justice to the common people.</p>
<p>   To do so, he has to pass through a whole army and the elite squad of Pendekar soldiers and their infamous burning swords. But most of all, he has to make peace with the past</p>
<p>Will he succeed?</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi. I'm Dennis Mallonee, the president of Heroic Publishing. We publish a line of superhero comic books featuring wonderful characters such as Flare, Liberty Girl, the League of Champions, WitchGirls Inc, and the Sensational G-Girl.</p>
<p>One of my favorite titles is comic book legend Roy Thomas's ANTHEM, set in an alternate reality in which the Axis powers are on the verge of winning World War II. In that world, America stands on the verge of defeat, and the young heroes of Project Anthem are freedom's last best hope. Heroic Publishing is all about heroes and heroism against all odds, so naturally when Roy first pitched this to me, I fell in love with the concept. </p>
<p>Only five issues of ANTHEM have thus far been published. But Roy Thomas and the extraordinary artist Benito Gallego are ready to get cracking on issue #6. Roy has plotted out the story, and Benito has already laid out all 24 pages of artwork.</p>
<p>Now we need your help. Let's bring this project to a successful conclusion.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As part of this project, we're also planning to bring back into print the first four issues of ANTHEM, in brand-new 2nd editions. We have plenty of copies of issue #5, but very few remaining copies of the original editions of issues #1 through #4.</p>
<p>The first $1000 of funding will go toward printing those second editions of the first four issues of ANTHEM.</p>
<p>The next $6500 of funding will help finance the production of ANTHEM #6.</p>
<p>Even if we fall short of that total goal, any funding we do receive will go toward the production of the new ANTHEM comic book. Bottom line: The closer we get, the more quickly we'll be able to get ANTHEM #6 into print.</p>
<p>And if, with your help, we're able to exceed that goal, Roy and Benito are eager to get started on ANTHEM #7, ANTHEM #8, and many more issues yet to come.</p>
<p>As perks, </p>
<ul>
<li>Digital copies of all six issues of ANTHEM</li>
<li>Physical copies of all six issues of ANTHEM, autographed by Roy Thomas</li>
<li>Your name immortalized in ANTHEM #6 with a thank you for your contribution</li>
<li>Anything else you can think of that you might like to receive; just drop me a note saying what you have in mind, and we'll see if we can't add it to the reward options</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The story of the young heroes of Project Anthem is a story that Roy and Gallego have been champing at the bit to tell, a story that has only barely begun.</p>
<p>With your help, we can all find out what happens next.</p>
<h3>The Time Frame</h3>
<p>It will take a few months for Benito to complete the artwork, Roy to complete the script, and get ANTHEM #6 to our printer. Right now, if we can achieve our goal, we're looking toward March of 2019 as the release date. </p>

<p>War Angels is a new take on the Valkyrie legend that allows the reader to immerse themselves into a storyline that crosses genres as the War Angels fight against the forces of evil in multiple realms. In some realms magic is as real as science. In others, you'll see futuristic, technologically-advanced civilizations and cultures. And of course, we'll get a gritty view of the modern world as we know it.</p>
<p>As part of this kickstarter MWP Comics has created TWO FULL GRAPHIC NOVELS in the War Angels Universe: WAR ANGELS Volume 1&amp; WAR ANGELS: ORIGINS. </p>
<p><strong>Note: The image and character of Olga in chapter 3 of War Angels: Origins is based on international model and actress Olga Alberti, from Saint Petersburg, Russia. She has been seen in such magazines as Cosmopolitan, Vogue, Men's Health, and Playboy (Playboy Russia's Miss May 2012).  </strong></p>

<p>WAR ANGELS VOLUME 1 is the 'main' story arc and follows the character Val in her origin story that allow us to see the world of the War Angels unfold through her eyes. In Chapter 1, we see Val as a seemingly happy high-school girl but soon learn her dark secret. </p>

<p>In Chapter 2, Val begins to come to grips with the reality of the existence of other realms, namely the magical home realm of the battalion of War Angels known as The Order of the Lioness. But Val is soon thrown into battle as a group of War Angels fall into a trap in the magical, medieval realm of Escinea.   Val is almost killed when she faces her first Wraith Witch, the dark counterpart to the War Angels, but is saved by Ho'nehe (from Issue 1.5).</p>

<p><strong>AND THE SECOND GRAPHIC NOVEL IS -- WAR ANGELS: ORIGINS</strong></p>

<p>Chapter 1 is the character Ho’nehe’s origin story. Ho’nehe is a key player in the WAR ANGELS VOLUME 1 and as such, her story is the longest, at 37 B&amp;W pages.

War Angels is a new take on the Valkyrie legend that allows the reader to immerse themselves into a storyline that crosses genres as the War Angels fight against the forces of evil in multiple realms. In some realms magic is as real as science. In others, you'll see futuristic, technologically-advanced civilizations and cultures. And of course, we'll get a gritty view of the modern world as we know it.
As part of this kickstarter MWP Comics has created TWO FULL GRAPHIC NOVELS in the War Angels Universe: WAR ANGELS Volume 1& WAR ANGELS: ORIGINS. 
Note: The image and character of Olga in chapter 3 of War Angels: Origins is based on international model and actress Olga Alberti, from Saint Petersburg, Russia. She has been seen in such magazines as Cosmopolitan, Vogue, Men's Health, and Playboy (Playboy Russia's Miss May 2012).  
The Stories...  
First, War Angels Volume 1

WAR ANGELS VOLUME 1 is the 'main' story arc and follows the character Val in her origin story that allow us to see the world of the War Angels unfold through her eyes. In Chapter 1, we see Val as a seemingly happy high-school girl but soon learn her dark secret. 

 


 
But when she comes to aid of another, her sacrifice draws the attention of a magical order of warriors that have been in a fight against the forces of darkness since before recorded history.


 
In Chapter 2, Val begins to come to grips with the reality of the existence of other realms, namely the magical home realm of the battalion of War Angels known as The Order of the Lioness. But Val is soon thrown into battle as a group of War Angels fall into a trap in the magical, medieval realm of Escinea.   Val is almost killed when she faces her first Wraith Witch, the dark counterpart to the War Angels, but is saved by Ho'nehe (from Issue 1.5).

 

Chapter 3 brings us back to contemporary Earth. Hot on the trail of those that killed their sisters, Val, Raven, and Ho'nehe track their enemy back to the realm of Earth--a Los Angels night club to be exact. But then things go wrong. 

 

AND THE SECOND GRAPHIC NOVEL IS -- WAR ANGELS: ORIGINS
WAR ANGELS: ORIGINS is an anthology of five different origin stories for characters within the WAR ANGELS universe. Multiple artists were used to create unique styles as each character has a unique story.

Chapter 1 is the character Ho’nehe’s origin story. Ho’nehe is a key player in the WAR ANGELS VOLUME 1 and as such, her story is the longest, at 37 B&W pages. Ho’nehe is half Cheyenne/half Lakota Sioux and comes of age as one of the few female warriors during the period of the Plains Wars in the 1870s. When her world is destroyed by a US Cavalry patrol, her actions set in motion events that will not only earn her a place with the War Angels but show the reader why she is special, even among these magical warriors.

 
Chapter 2 shows us the War Angel Winnie. Winnie is a runaway slave in 1850’s Tennessee.

 
Chapter 3 is set in Leningrad in 1942 and introduces the War Angel Olga. Olga is a Russian sniper that sacrifices herself to save another fellow soldier. Heavily outnumbered, she defeats several German soldiers and almost kills the crew of a massive Tiger tank before Olga herself is killed by a German sniper. Now, Chapter 2 ties into Chapter 3 as Winnie, now a full-fledged War Angel, destroys the tank and its crew before taking Olga.
Note: The image and character of Olga is based on international model and actress Olga Alberti, from Saint Petersburg, Russia. She has been seen in such magazines as Cosmopolitan, Vogue, Men's Health, and Playboy (Playboy Russia's Miss May 2012). 

 

 


 

Chapter 4 shows the other side of war by giving insight into how a Wraith Witch is created. This chapter shows that in many cases it is a simple decision that can drive a character toward the dark or the light, such as with the Wraith Witch Ava.  

 
Chapter 5 shows us how one of the captains of The Order of the Lioness became a War Angel. Natali is a Viking shield maiden in 9th century Scandinavia.  
 


 
Risks & Challenges
The artwork is complete. We are working with a printer which is local to us and has done all of our graphic novels.  This is simply a platform to sell our comics to a wider audience.

<p>This first volume of <i>Tempest</i> begins an epic fantasy story. A principled but self-doubting prince, a listless Elf, and a desensitized millennial all find their realities flipped upside down. One is tested. One is enchanted. One is abducted. Each gets caught up in events larger than themselves and must find a way through the chaotic storm.</p>
<p>Featuring adventure, rich symbolism, and mind-bending cosmology stretching across three worlds, Tempest is a story for all lovers of fantasy and searchers of meaning.</p>
<p>I, Natasha Kennedy, have worked for nearly a decade on this story and have attempted to combine a gripping novel series with colorful and imaginative artwork. I have put a lot of years into writing this story and creating a unique world, so TEMPEST is not only an adventure with diverse and unique characters but takes place in a carefully-crafted fantastical universe soaked in rich symbolism.</p>

This will also be my first time having a comic printed so though I intend for that to go smoothly there may be some delays with shipping.

<p>If you're new to Stellar Odyssey this campaign offers the opportunity to get all 3 issues that have already been published and get yourself caught up while we work on issues 4 &amp; 5. Issue one features two stories from some talented indie comic creators. The first story is 12 pages written by Ray Marek III and illustrated by Jay Sloan and Dino Agor. Then there is a six page story written by Brian Hawkins and illustrated by Flavio Rodrigues that serves as a prelude to the next four issues. The first story introduces characters that will be the main focus of the ""Knights of Belaterra"" and ""Vagabond Blues"" series. The second story features a group of smugglers on the run from bounty hunters as they try to deliver an illegal package to a mystery client.</p>

<p>Welcome to the Stellar Odyssey universe! Issue one is somewhat of a sampler issue. First we're introduced to Jacy Legend and Macen Delak as they prepare for two separate missions. Jacy and his crew are colonizers for the Belaterra regime and are about to set out to establish a new colony on a planet recently claimed by government officials on Belaterra. While Macen and his partner Rhyne Rozerg are both Knights of Belaterra, a well trained order of knights that enforce the laws of Belaterra, and they set out to aid a village of citizens that have been under attack from amphibious alien creatures. Then the final act of issue one sets up a story arc that spotlights infamous smuggler Atilla Banks and his crew as they try to escape a group of bounty hunters that have all come to collect the price on their heads.</p>

<p>Starship Delta is a series that I've been writing about 2 years, and have been scripting for 8 months. With a collaborating artist, and new team member the comic book is beginning to come to fruition. This story follows the events caused by a mysterious starship and its involvement with a crew that finds itself thrown together through a whirlwind of circumstances. Starting on the ominous and dark ""Cosmic Colosseum,"" we watch as each member of the crew begins hatching a plan for escape. </p>

Starship Delta is a series that I've been writing about 2 years, and have been scripting for 8 months. With a collaborating artist, and new team member the comic book is beginning to come to fruition. This story follows the events caused by a mysterious starship and its involvement with a crew that finds itself thrown together through a whirlwind of circumstances. Starting on the ominous and dark ""Cosmic Colosseum,"" we watch as each member of the crew begins hatching a plan for escape.

He lost his fame, freedom and people's respect. They chained him under the temple.Sick transit Florid mundi, people finally forgot him. One day, he died.At the same time, the temple began to fly away. Since then, the way people saw the temple was changed. The flying mountain drew a lot of attention,  even the emperor spoke highly of it. People started to worship the temple, just as they worshiped rootless. The town was divided: people the earth enjoyed the benefit of booming economy while monks in clouds were stepping onto the path of despair. At the end, in front of Buddha, we are all just fragile mortals. Even in Clouds, the peace can not be maintained.</p>

<p>Also, the combination of eastern and western--the inside-painting snuff bottle. </p>
<p>Let me tell you something about his. Snuff was first invited by native America, and went popular in Europe. During 18 century, it came to Asian. Since then, Chinese began to manufacture snuff bottles, which create a new kind of art--Inside-painting. What is inside painting? Basically, the artist's brush comes  through the mouth of bottle, and paint inside of the bottle. Many Chinese art are painted inside the bottle. A bottle of snuff at that time was a western wild herb contained in an eastern art. The snuff bottle is a combination of east and west culture. Just like this comic. We asked an artist to paint our cover inside the snuff bottle, which is contained in a small box.     </p>

</div></div>","Hi! Thanks for checking out RATLINE's IndieGogo page. I know it's tough to part with hard-earned cash, so I'd like to tell you a little bit about me and this project before you make the big commitment.
 

About Ratlines
At the end of World War II, the Nazis started to get nervous the allies would discover their war crimes and they’d be punished.  Consequently, the Nazis attempted to demolish death camps, kill witnesses, burn paperwork and figure out how to escape prosecution.
With the assistance, both willful and unwitting, of groups like the Catholic Church and the International Committee of the Red Cross – AND individuals who were often highly bribable – a path from the middle of Europe down to the ports at Genoa and Rome was established.  
Consider it an Underground Railroad for really bad people.
Well, the U.S. spy masters eventually found out about this and rather than shutting it down (which they would have had a hard time doing, especially considering the power of the Catholic Church), they decided to use it for their own purposes… to get the Nazis THEY wanted to emigrate to America out of Europe without detection.  These included the scientists (Operation Paperclip) and spies (Operation Bloodstone) that we wanted to use against the coming conflict with Russia.
Our Ratline starts in Munich, cuts through Austria, crosses the Alps and goes down into Italy, concluding in Genoa – where ships wait to take people to South America and Palestine.
Interesting thing about the Ratlines – there were cases where Jewish victims of the Holocaust actually crossed paths with their Nazi persecutors while trying to immigrate to Palestine.  Crazy.
 
About my main character Hanna
Hanna is a composite of a bunch of bad-ass female spies from the World War II era including Violette Szabo, Christine Granville and Virginia Hall.  Check ‘em out on Wikipedia.  Really cool women.
Hanna's a first-generation American whose parents emigrated to the U.S. after the German economy buckled after World War I.
And though her parents – her father in particular – remain loyal to Germany and think this Hitler fellow is doing to some good things, Hanna is American through and through.
When she’s recruited by the OSS – due to the fact that she’s smart, pretty and speaks fluent German – she accepts immediately.  She’s trained at a secret camp in Canada called Camp X where she learns things like hand to hand combat and how to set explosives.

The Prologue will introduce you to the characters and tell you about their ambitions, and it will consist of 8 issues. The first issue consists of 28 pages.What do we need the money for? It’s needed for putting it in print. We need to get $1700 to do that. By purchasing the first issue by pre-ordering method you will not only get the great story in printed version, but you will also help the project to develop further! You can choose one of the 7 editions.In addition to the printed issue, one of the editions will have a pleasant surprise – a figure of the main character of the Novel, Dif the Red Dragon. The figure is made of colored plaster on the most modern 3D printer and has a very high quality.

Ever since i was a kid i've always read comics. I used to get the beano delivered every morning before school. As i got older i never stopped reading comics but the characters changed. Now it was Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and i've always wanted to bring a charecter to life, just like these. My story focuses on Bonum Malus (Bo-Ma). Half angel, Half demon (perfectly down the middle) he is Gods personal hitman. He does the jobs God can't. If a demon is over stepping his bounderies or being more trouble than usual, God sends Bo-Ma. When a person of great importance is abducted from heaven using the travelycio amulet, an amulet that had been hidden for many centuries, Bo-Ma is sent to retrieve the amulet and remove whom ever was responsible. This tale leads Bo-Ma on roads of twist, turns, truth and lies. A horror/comedy with plenty of removed hearts.</strong></p><p><strong>I would love for you to join me in bringing this charecter to life in a epic adventure i think (if your into horror, superheroes, antiheroes with a bit of blood splatter) you're really going to enjoy this.</strong></p><p><strong>A few hurdles i will have to over are time and equipment. I have a full time job so i can only do my passion in the evenings and weekends. Its not always possible to do this but im a hard worker and every second i do get will be spent on this. Also tools. I am limited at the moment as to everything i need which is where funding will help. It will help with the overall production of the graphic novel, be it physical or digital release. I hope we can do both.</strong></p><p><strong>Thank you for taking the time to read this and i hope to bring you this story very soon.

Now it was Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and i've always wanted to bring a charecter to life, just like these. My story focuses on Bonum Malus (Bo-Ma). Half angel, Half demon (perfectly down the middle) he is Gods personal hitman. He does the jobs God can't. If a demon is over stepping his bounderies or being more trouble than usual, God sends Bo-Ma. When a person of great importance is abducted from heaven using the travelycio amulet, an amulet that had been hidden for many centuries, Bo-Ma is sent to retrieve the amulet and remove whom ever was responsible. This tale leads Bo-Ma on roads of twist, turns, truth and lies. A horror/comedy with plenty of removed hearts.I would love for you to join me in bringing this charecter to life in a epic adventure i think (if your into horror, superheroes, antiheroes with a bit of blood splatter) you're really going to enjoy this.A few hurdles i will have to over are time and equipment. I have a full time job so i can only do my passion in the evenings and weekends. Its not always possible to do this but im a hard worker and every second i do get will be spent on this. Also tools. I am limited at the moment as to everything i need which is where funding will help. It will help with the overall production of the graphic novel, be it physical or digital release. I hope we can do both.Thank you for taking the time to read this and i hope to bring you this story very soon. Check in the updates to see the novels progression.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello Everyone, </p>
<p>I am just a simpleton who can't stop wondering why and how Donald Trump became a real life cartoon.  So I decided to start a comic book that is a 100% real biography of the smartest and most handsomest man in the universe.  We follow this hero through his shenanigans and adventures he has gotten himself into.  In this universe he is a misunderstood super hero who just wants to make the world a better place.  His arch nemesis the Democrats won't stop harassing him and they won't invite him to any cool parties.  I grew up with marvel comics and this X-Men inspired universe has all the usual suspects. This project consists of 6 one page shorts with covers, taking you through Trump's daily adventures.   I wish I could take more credit for this content but this guy writes most of it for me.    Preview FARCE OF THE DEAL and IS THERE A DOCTOR INT HE HOUSE?  If you are a little damaged like me you just might get a chuckle out of it.  I am currently writing volume 2 so please help me get this universe off the ground.  This is my first comic book so please be gentle.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: No cartoon illustrations were hurt during production.</p>
<p>The funds will be used to pay my illustrator and get the material printed.  In addition the funds will help with getting volume 2 produced.</p>

The Crooked King. The True Face of Madness. Kilanthrotep.Unfortunately the demon Kilanthrotep has a use for the kids beyond simply devouring their souls. He seeks vengeance upon the mortal occultist who betrayed and trapped him over a century ago, and he wants the children to serve as his agents on Earth and the heralds of his return.Their souls tainted and their bodies possessed by bloodthirsty spirits, the group of friends has little choice but to do Kilanthrotep's bidding, even at the cost of their own humanity. Justin M.

ALL HOPE?

</b><p>The journey of
""ABANDON ALL HOPE"" began 3 years ago with an epic 90 page screenplay.
Our idea was to bring another ass kicking strong female lead character to life,
taking inspiration from Ripley (Aliens) and Sarah Conner (Terminator). We wanted the whole story to center around one
broken character, as she lives alone and fights solo to complete her mission.
She must learn and adapt with each days obstacles as she gets closer and closer

STORY?</b></p>
<p>‘Abandon All Hope’
is a dark sci-fi action story with a hint of drama in the mix. In Volume 1 we follow
the footsteps of a cloned soldier Alejandra who is forced to search alone for
human life in a dark world now inhabited by a violent alien race. Readers are
thrown into the story two years after the invasion, when earth is at its
darkest time and our hero Alejandra is deciding if it is time to give up hope
or not. Alejandra is being broken down physically and emotionally after every
unsuccessful day. Unknown memories are affecting her and her enemy is only
getting stronger and their army only bigger. </p>

become a family member to us and it's thrilling, scary, exciting and 
downright emotional to watch her grow and evolve through the series.  We have had our own struggles to find the perfect medium to tell the world about Alejandra and we think, no, we know that
 we have found the correct one. We have gotten this far with her story 
by ourselves, now, we want to invite the world into the Abandon All Hope
 family. ABANDON
ALL HOPE?

The journey of
""ABANDON ALL HOPE"" began 3 years ago with an epic 90 page screenplay.
Our idea was to bring another ass kicking strong female lead character to life,
taking inspiration from Ripley (Aliens) and Sarah Conner (Terminator). We wanted the whole story to center around one
broken character, as she lives alone and fights solo to complete her mission.
She must learn and adapt with each days obstacles as she gets closer and closer
to her goals.THE
STORY?
‘Abandon All Hope’
is a dark sci-fi action story with a hint of drama in the mix. In Volume 1 we follow
the footsteps of a cloned soldier Alejandra who is forced to search alone for
human life in a dark world now inhabited by a violent alien race. Readers are
thrown into the story two years after the invasion, when earth is at its
darkest time and our hero Alejandra is deciding if it is time to give up hope
or not. Alejandra is being broken down physically and emotionally after every
unsuccessful day. Unknown memories are affecting her and her enemy is only
getting stronger and their army only bigger. 
Both scripts for Volume 2 & 3 are complete.  WE
WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU.
We have created
‘Abandon All Hope’ to appeal to everyone. Alejandra is a bad ass chick who is
ruthless in her defense of her world but on the other hand she is sensitive and
inquisitive. There is self-discovery, there is connection, there is blood,
amputations, explosions and booty. We want you to join us on this journey. 
WHERE WILL THE MONEY GO?
The money raised
in this campaign will go toward - Paying our amazing artists for their time and hard
work to create the remaining 51 pages. This includes the penciling, inking and coloring. 
- Production of our great perks (Printing the perks, shipping Australia-wide and Internationally)- IndieGogo and related fees. 
- Any extra
made will first and foremost complete Abandon All Hope Vol 1's journey to the print hub, then kick off production of ‘Abandon All Hope’ Vol 2! 
THE
TEAM?
We have already
put so much passion and heart into this project, including taking our time to
find a talented art team that would best bring the words to life and we could
not be more happy with who we have chosen. They have both been a pleasure to
work with and every page has been better then we could have hoped for, just see
for yourself. 
Hailing from
different parts of the globe, meet the team that created Alejandra and her
world.

<h3>Story</h3>
<p>Amari is a boxer famous for defeating men at their own game of rough and tough. But when she witnesses her young fan being kidnapped by a trafficking cult, she steps up from a lowly cheater to an unlikely hero! Strap in for the action-packed, hilarious and amorous… ORGASM GIRL!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p>Me and Josh had been planning making a comic together for a while now, and I never thought for a second this was the comic we would be doing! I pitched a bunch of different ideas I had accumulated, but (shockingly) this is the one that really stood out to him. Originally Orgasm Girl was going to be a webcomic I was making on the side, but now rather than working on it all with my lonesome self, I have the ultimate comic team! And while Josh may not being doing the interior penciling anymore, he still played a big part in putting together the story you see here.</p>
<p>The idea was to make a character with a stupid, yet useful super power, and the ability to make people orgasm came to mind. From there I thought up villains, puns, and all kinds of crazy things~</p>

Kronokosto, as the locals call him, is the biggest and baddest dragon around, and commands all lesser species to slaughter innocent Herans in droves.
But Daerokos decides enough is enough!

Chapter One will be 64 pages of story
You'll dive head-first into Daerokos Galvan's troubled mind as he relates to you the reasons for his strange surroundings and dismal predicament. You'll witness the turmoil that shaped this young man into a living legend.

An epic fantasy saga spanning years in the life of our hero; watch him grow and face unbelievable odds with nothing more than his iron will and determination
Realize the struggle of Hera's children and its terrifying implications for life on Earth as we know it
A hand-crafted world over a decade in-the-making. Hera is an entirely fleshed-out planet!
Rife with themes that respectfully utilize speculative history and evolution

Wisdom Comes has sat idle for far too long in my dusty old notebooks, and I want the world to EXPERIENCE this story for themselves!

<h3>Story Summary</h3>
<p>Marcus Matthews is a private investigator. He's good at what he does. Some even say he's the best. In fact, so lofty is his reputation, the local papers have taken to calling him, ""The Great Detective"". But don't remind him. He hates it when you call him that...</p>
<p>Marcus has his work cut out for him when he's visited by a desperate widow looking to solve her late husband's death. She claims it's murder, but proof is elusive. And the players involved don't like the kind of questions being asked. </p>
<p>Follow Marcus on his next adventure as he dives into the seedy world of shadowed stalkers, police informants, and back-alley terrors. Will he have what it takes to solve the case? Can he truly be the Great Detective?      </p>
<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hi. I'm Dennis. Thanks for checking out my campaign.</p>
<p>Great Detective is a character that's been bouncing around my head since I was a kid. He started out as a crude sketch: a man with a fedora and trench coat, peering through a magnifying glass as he followed a trail of muddy footprints. I believe I was six or seven at the time. And for years, that's all he was, a sketch. Just the barest of concepts. But then, three decades later, seemingly out of nowhere, his world sprang to vivid life in my imagination. I just had to get it out. I had to share it with the world! But how to do it? </p>
<p>Comics are a medium I've loved for years. For as long as I can remember, I wanted to be a comic book creator. Life ultimately had other plans, but that didn't mean I couldn't dabble. In between work, school, and child-rearing, I wrote a script, found an amazing artist, and produced my very own comic book: Great Detective issue #1, <a href=""https://bubbsy00.wixsite.com/octoberstories/october-comics"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">which you can get here for free</a>.</p>
<p>Why offer it for free? Well, I'm a realist. Chances are, you don't know me very well. You have no incentive to simply trust that I'll provide you an entertaining story. So, instead of giving you a sales pitch, I'll let the work speak for itself. If you like what you see, donate to the campaign so I can bring you the next chapter of Great Detective.         </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need Your Help With</h3>
<p>So, as it turns out, dabbling in comics is not cheap, nor should it be. Comic book artists are some of the most talented, hard working people in the creative industry. They are the life blood of this medium, and they deserve to be compensated for their services.</p>
<p>The funds raised by this campaign are almost exclusively for the benefit of the artist. As the creator of Great Detective, my reward is simply seeing the work come to life. My artist, however, still needs to make a living.</p>
<p>In all, I would like to raise $1,200. That's $1,020 to produce the illustrations for Great Detective issue #2, and $180 for any print orders that come in. As I'm lettering the series, there will be no need to pay for a letterer.</p>
<p>That's it! There are no other costs. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Of course, every venture has its risks. Life happens to all of us. I could be hit by a beer truck tomorrow, and that would be the end of Great Detective. However, barring that worst case scenario, the main risk I foresee is timeliness. I'm a husband, father of four children, I work full-time, and I'm about to start studying for the CPA exam. Any of those factors could interfere with lettering the series. </p>
<p>My artist is likewise a busy man. Depending on how deep his commission queue is, work on the illustrations may not begin immediately upon funding the issue.</p>
<p>I'm not saying the above scenarios <i>will</i>  happen, but they could. Just want to be up front.       </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute to the campaign, that's perfectly okay. To be honest, I consider it a win that you've read this far.</p>
<p>However, if you would still like to help, please consider sharing my campaign with your friends. Point them to Great Detective issue #1. Share the campaign on Facebook, Twitter, or whatever social media platform you frequent. Word-of-mouth can go a long way.</p>

What I Need Your Help With
So, as it turns out, dabbling in comics is not cheap, nor should it be. Comic book artists are some of the most talented, hard working people in the creative industry. They are the life blood of this medium, and they deserve to be compensated for their services.
The funds raised by this campaign are almost exclusively for the benefit of the artist. As the creator of Great Detective, my reward is simply seeing the work come to life. My artist, however, still needs to make a living.
In all, I would like to raise $1,200. That's $1,020 to produce the illustrations for Great Detective issue #2, and $180 for any print orders that come in. As I'm lettering the series, there will be no need to pay for a letterer.

<p>I’m an artist and published author, with over 40 years experience in Graphic Design, Writing, Illustration, Comic Strips, Cartoons, Photography, Copy Writing, Film Making and Publishing.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521574607/sjseuedhqit9w3smq7s0.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>‘Hatch’ has been around for many years now and it’s about time he met the rest of the world. Hatch is unique. It’s as simple as that; there are no language barriers with this strip; translated words can change the mood, meaning or substance of any writing. Only ‘sound effects’ are used; there is no dialogue. All Hatch’s adventures can be enjoyed by all peoples in the universe, whatever language(s) they may understand – he’s simply a visual experience. And now, Hatch is finally here, in all his lonely ‘glory’; lost, bewildered and, yeah, amazed.‘Hatch’, however, is not just an ordinary cartoon strip. No, no. Far from it. Hatch is, in fact, a builder, an experimenter and (occasionally) a time traveller and although he is a ‘man’ lost in time and space, his world is not without incident, not without accident and certainly not without meaning. Hatch endures in us all; struggling to come to terms with himself, his world and his universe. A universe he marvels at, embraces and is ultimately frustrated with. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521574639/qk20vmnta0lh4ykumwkj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I’ve kept the ‘perks’ for ‘Hatch’ to a minimum, in an effort to offer more items of quality, to hopefully make Hatch the centre point of the project, rather than just what one can get for making a pledge. The comic edition of ‘Hatch’ comes in at 32 A4 pages all full of humour and amazement (generally his, but hopefully yours too). I am unable to express the magnitude of what achieving the goal of getting Hatch out to the public would mean to me as it lies beyond words, but for that to happen, I need your help not only in pledging but also passing the word around all your friends, family, acquaintances and everyone you know on social media.</p>
<p>I need the money from your generous pledges to realise my dream of publishing ‘Hatch’. In return, you will receive the first edition of the A4, full colour comic BEFORE it appears in any shop or on any shelf.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521574658/cfsvxvezhumgybct7jpe.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I need the initial £650 to print the first 200 copies of ‘Hatch’; the more money pledged, the more copies I can have printed, thus bringing the cost per copy down. So with more copies, I can get more into the market place, gaining more exposure, etc. </p>
<p>Apart from the comic itself, the perks for this campaign boast quite unique items:</p>
<p>I’m offering SIX pages of Original Hatch Artwork from the comic itself, signed and dedicated. The purchase price for these pages has been reduced to £55 for this campaign only.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521574681/v6ath1m69ozdqypbxjvt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I’m also offering the chance to own a unique unpublished one page story of Hatch,  a pen and ink (black and white) original Hatch scenario (6 panels maximum) featuring our hero in another impossible situation, produced for the person making this pledge! This offer is unlimited and so I hope to be drawing them for weeks on end!</p>
<p>The final ‘perk’ is the best one of them all: The ULTIMATE Hatch: A HUNDRED PAGE, A5, bound art book containing literally HUNDREDS of NEW, never seen before sketches of our hero! Signed and dedicated, of course. Also, this pledge offers a one hour Skype call with anyone interested in speaking to me about Hatch or anything else they want to chat about! This perk is a ‘one shot’ - an exclusive art book offered to the ‘Hatch’ connoisseur – signed, sealed and delivered with ultimate care!</p>
<p>This is a rare chance to make a difference in the comic and publishing world; to own a copy of the most unique cartoon character to appear in many, many  years. You can be at the beginning of the adventure, the beginning of a series of works that will make a tremendous impact on comics in general and storytelling in particular.</p>
<p>I have published many comics over the last four decades, largely featuring my own characters and their conflicts. Last year I produced the documentary film  ‘Jack Kirby : A Personal Journey’, which featured 30 minutes of unseen and therefore exclusive footage of myself talking to the comics legend in his own home. (This film is still available on DVD, so get in touch if you wish to purchase a copy!) Comics are in my blood; in the 80s and 90s I illustrated several licensed characters for Egmont Publishing (Gutenberg House), as well as being the regular artist on Harrier Comics’ series ‘Forest’. I published, edited and co-wrote ‘Crikey! The Great British Comics Magazine’ amongst other periodicals. I am currently working on two illustrated science fiction novels.</p>
<p>I want to make Hatch ‘real’ - to get him out into the public domain for all to see and enjoy. You can help me to do that and for that I (and Hatch) would be truly grateful.</p>
<p>The general Risks &amp; Challenges to projects like this one are hardly unique, and I have identified the three stages to this project.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 1:</strong> I have produced all of the artwork for the comic. The stories have been illustrated and coloured. </p>
<p><strong>Stage 2:</strong> This is where you come in: the funds to get Hatch into print. This sounds the simplest of the stages, but is, in fact, the most challenging.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 3:</strong> To get Hatch into the shops and the publics hands. Without the physical copy, this, of course, cannot be achieved.</p>
<p>In summary, stage two is the greatest challenge; without those funds stage three becomes redundant and stage one pointless.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521574773/rzwaromytedjugehbsai.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I believe I am more than qualified to overcome all the challenges set before the realisation of Hatch, except for stage two. Simply put, I need your help; I can communicate with people on the telephone, via email and on social media. That is the easy part of the project and therefore I cannot emphasise the importance of your pledges.</p>
<p>The word is already out in the public domain; people from England to the United States to Australia to Thailand are asking me daily about ‘Hatch’; when is he ‘out’; when can they see him; when and where can they purchase this first edition. Hatch already has a considerable following. That said, and with your help, I can spread the word further, get those extra pledges, make this happen in a big way. I plan to advertise the book, call people via the telephone, on email and in social media. Comics websites, podcasts, radio and possibly TV appearances are in the plan.</p>
<p>I’d also like to engage those people who can't contribute financially, but still want this campaign to achieve its goals: simply tell everyone about Hatch. Tell your family and friends to their faces and on all your social media outlets. Show people your interest, get the word out and make some noise about my campaign; tell everyone, use social media outlets like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram - you name it! I would be most grateful for any help you can give me. Also, don’t forget to use the Indiegogo share tools!</p>

To be swept off your feet and taken on a grand journey with no limits. No restrictions, living the life you want and not the life that had been handed to you. This isn’t that story… This story is the worst possible version of that. Getting swept off your feet to be taken on a death trip, never knowing that you will get to go home, to see your family. Forced to make decisions that will traumatize and make you the worst version of yourself. This is that story.  I have always dreamed of that escape from reality, going on a journey bigger than my mind could handle. I wanted to tell a tale that played on that idea. A journey bigger than you can handle and realizing that you don't want it, and you are stuck with it till the end.This is the first part of a 5 Issue story following the journey of Eliza! This Campaign is to fund printing of #1, All 19 pages of which are already completed!What are people saying about DISPLACED? “Displaced hits all the right notes of a great first issue. It provides a solid background without delaying the action. It leaves enough mystery to leave us wanting more.”-For The Love of Indie           3.5/5“This book is a very solid outing. The setup is great; Getting to see the family life is a great way for the readers to feel the shock of the forthcoming events”  -Comic Crusaders           9.5/10“This story is amazingly smooth. Every moment feels like a natural course of events (even the unexpected ones) “-Chico Comics Page5 Page PreviewWhat is the story?Eliza is a 17-year-old high school girl. Living day by day just making it through, making sure her little brother Jonathan is safe from the shocking realization that their parents are getting a divorce.   The story starts off with Eliza waking up in her room and realizing that something is not right. Of all the days this one is one that seems out of place. Her dad hadn't come home, and her mother is doing the best she can. Jon confronts Eliza about the fact that their father hadn't returned and doesn't understand why they fight all the time. Eliza' world gets flipped when a mysterious woman in a robotic suit tries to get her to come with her saying that she is in danger. The story picks up from here and trouble ensues. Who is The Creative Team?Writer & Creator - Kevin HamiltonThis is Kevin Hamilton' writing debut! He has a love for writing short stories and has never really messed with writing comics before but has always had a love.

<h3>What is ImpStory?</h3>
<p>ImpStory is a graphic novel (planned to be the first in a series) written and drawn by myself (Cody Baier) with artistic collaborator Victor Neumann. Striving to be a departure from the typical fantasy story, ImpStory features an atypical cast of characters in an adventure that spans across several different worlds. Familiar fantasy races and monsters are depicted in unique ways, and our heroes will face off against completely new and original foes (as opposed to the typical goblins/skeletons/etc. one would find in your average fantasy tale). </p>
<p>The art of ImpStory also takes a novel approach, as Victor does not simply color my artwork. Rather, the art of the comic is a true collaboration, where I draw the initial version of the page, and Victor adds to it before finishing the colors, in order to truly combine our individual artistic strengths to create a more visually engaging experience.</p>
<h3>The Premise</h3>
<p>Within the great cosmic tree of the Sephirot, the universe is in turmoil. Twenty years ago, the Demons--long exiled to the hellish realm of Qliphoth for the nature of their creation--stormed the realm of the gods, led by a being known only by what they called him; ""Demonlord"". This Demonlord not only slew the entire pantheon, but did so effortlessly, leaving the entire Sephirot without divine rule or guidance. Nothing to protect the countless worlds within it from the Demons' cosmic crusade.</p>
<p>Before she was struck down, the goddess of creation Cerenis did as she always had when the universe faced a dire threat; she sent her blessings, which would find newborns destined to be exceptional people, and deem them as Chosen Ones. But with the gods long dead, when the Chosen Ones discovered what they were, they ignored the calling. </p>
<p>All except one: a Shadow Imp mage named Zippit.</p>
<p>Having spent years travelling to many worlds through the Starways, using his immense magical powers to help others, Zippit alone decided to answer the call--gods or no--and see what he could do to help. In order to learn what he can do as a Chosen, he must seek out the Cosmic Scribes; keepers of all the universe's knowledge, and former wards to the gods.</p>

<p>But this isn't just about me, it's about you; the audience. I can't ask you to fund a book without making it worth your while, after all.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge we face is simple: time and money. Victor and I both have our obligations, our bills to pay, clients to draw for, and even our own personal side projects.

<p>Mind Meld With DragonMasters’ Carlos Farias!</p>
<p>One Man Show: Carlos Farias Releases DragonMasters Through Wicked Comics</p>
<p>Carlos Farias is the creator, writer and artist of the recently released DragonMasters #1. DragonMasters is the third title he’s self-published through his company, Wicked Comics. It was a pleasure to talk with Carlos about his inspiration for DragonMasters, character design and worldbuilding, the struggles of indie creators, creative collaboration with fans, DIY action figure production and much more!</p>
<p>JR: How long have you been creating comics, and what made you want to start? What’s the Wicked Comics origin story?</p>
<p>CF: I started about three years ago. The plan was to stay one hundred percent independent and to try to create new ideas and stories. If you look at the market, lot of the books out there are the same characters doing same things over and over. I want to create new stories, new ideas and new characters. I see a lot of people who do the same superhero-type invincible hero. I just feel like there’s always room for different ideas.</p>
<p>JR: You are credited with character design, story and art on DragonMasters. Do you collaborate with anyone on the Wicked Comics titles, or are you a one man show?</p>
<p>CF: It’s pretty much a one man show. I do all the writing, developing the characters, artwork and coloring. That’s why sometimes it takes me a little bit longer to launch a title.</p>
<p>JR: I’m finding out when I interview creators that music often plays a huge inspirational role in their work and creative process. You’ve released three books up to this point: the first, ClownMan, about a clown vigilante, the second, KillSwitch, about a criminal who becomes a super soldier, and your most recent, DragonMasters, featuring a world of wizards, knights, barbarians, magic and dragons as well as advanced technology. Out of personal interest I have to ask: do you listen to hard rock or heavy metal music?</p>
<p>CF: It depends on the title. Definitely music plays a role in each story. As far as ClownMan, I see it as a dark underground world. The type of music that fits with it is almost like industrial rock because ClownMan was inspired by The Crow and the Joker. The same goes for KillSwitch. The music is more of a scientific or futuristic soundtrack. DragonMasters is definitely fantasy. I listen to a lot of fantasy type music in the vein of Conan, Masters of the Universe and Dungeons &amp; Dragons. A lot of that played a role. It’s fantasy music like instrumentals. For DragonMasters I type in fantasy music and try to put myself in that world.</p>
<p>JR: So you search by music theme?</p>
<p>CF: Yeah, for ClownMan I’ll search for creepy carnival music. It helps a bit if you’re running into a blank, you hear something and it might spark a new idea.</p>
<p>JR: ClownMan and KillSwitch are both dark, gritty superheroes. DragonMasters is your new book. What made you want to depart from this theme to do a heroic fantasy book? </p>
<p>CF: I didn’t want to be typecast as always doing the same thing, or want people to think, “Oh this guy’s a dark person.” As far as the company goes, I want as much variety as I can get. DragonMasters is a fantasy book that’s not your standard comic book character. In the future, you’ll see I even have a cartoon character. So there will be a variety of books, not just superhero titles.</p>
<p>JR: So that allows you to find the audience for Wicked Comics?</p>
<p>CF: Right! It helps get a variety of people interested. For a single book, maybe people with certain interests will be drawn to that story. A good variety of ideas and stories will help to bring a bigger audience to my creations.</p>
<p>JR: Please tell readers a bit about the world of DragonMasters and how the book came to be.</p>
<p>CF: It was always in the back of my head. I wanted to create this fantasy land. The story takes place in a world called Dragonia. How it came about is that I’m really big into Star Wars. I always liked that conflict between the Jedi and Sith. This is my twist on that but in a world of dragons. There are even crazy backstories for each Slayer and each Master. You can keep going into this world and finding out more about each character.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>JR: Is this title going to be an ongoing series?</p>
<p>CF: Yeah, that’s the plan. You’re gonna see certain relationships between the Masters and the Slayers in the upcoming issues. You’ll see things between them that you never saw coming. There will be plenty of twists and turns in the story. There’s also going to be all kinds of races like cat warriors. So yeah, all kinds of stuff!</p>
<p>JR: One aspect I think fans will be excited about is the mix of technology and fantasy in DragonMasters. What made you decide to incorporate science fiction technology?</p>
<p>CF: I wanted to throw a curve to the fantasy world. Take Conan the Barbarian for example, it’s strictly fantasy-based. But in DragonMasters, the Masters have their sanctuary called the Lair. When they bring in new Masters, they train them with a hologram dragon. They can practice and become better dragon slayers. So that’s the idea – to combine the technology aspect with swords and fantasy. It adds a different feeling to the story. Maybe there will be battles with Slayers armed with high tech guns but also with swords. There might also be special technology to capture dragons.</p>
<p>JR: One of the most interesting, unique and original characters in DragonMasters is the Emperor. What can you tell readers about him?</p>
<p>CF: See the design of that character? See how he runs off of tubes that go into his body? He runs off of the blood of dead kings. He’s a ten thousand-year-old dragon slayer. But because he has that blood running through him, he remains young and powerful. It all has to do with rejuvenation. The blood that flows through him gives him his power. The dark side of the Dragon Eye also gives him power. The Dragon Eye in Dragonia is like a religious symbol that has powers. If you’re an evil dark person, it gives you dark power. If you’re a good person, you use the good side of the Dragon Eye. It’s almost like something you channel.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>JR: The Kickstarter campaign for DragonMasters #1 is currently live. What would you say to anyone undecided or on the fence about backing the Kickstarter to convince them to get on board?</p>
<p>CF: For each comic I release, I try to do a Kickstarter for it. I haven’t funded through Kickstarter, but people purchase the books on their own. I would say to them that DragonMasters is unique and different. It brings a new world of fantasy to readers. It combines technology, dragons and dragon slaying. There’s tons of battles, and there’s going to be many characters each with their own identity and backstory. It’s going to be something that I feel like will continue for a long time, somewhat similar to Masters of the Universe.</p>
<p>JR: Many times it’s difficult for indie creators to complete books and bring them to market. They have to face a number of obstacles including getting enough time to work on them outside their day jobs, family obligations, problems with printers, finding the money to pay for print runs and just the motivation to keep going and finish the project. Are there any challenges you’ve faced on the road to bringing DragonMasters and the other Wicked Comics books to fans?</p>
<p>CF: Oh absolutely! Definitely motivation. What motivates someone to keep on going? Maybe they’re not seeing a lot of outcome from it, or not really making making a good living from it. To me it’s the fans. They write to me and say, “I’m looking forward to this title. When’s this title coming out?” That’s what keeps me going. Time is also hard to find sometimes. I spend so many hours working on titles. It’s endless. The hardest part is developing the story and coming up with the designs of the characters. A lot of times the first design of a character isn’t the finalized design. It takes me a long time to finally get the right look for each character.</p>
<p>JR: You’ve had great success in soliciting fan art of Wicked Comics characters from the artist community. I was listening to another interview where you said that some of the art you received even inspired you as you were creating later iterations of the ClownMan character. Can you tell readers more about this?</p>
<p>CF: Absolutely! The first iteration of ClownMan was almost like a cartoon, not how you see him now. I got some fan art from from an artist named Frank Soto. He drew ClownMan realistically, almost like The Crow. With that I kept on redesigning. A lot of the changes I make come directly from the fans. The public – they’re the ones who dictate whether the character is going to be successful or not. I always listen to what they say.</p>
<p>JR: Can you tell readers a bit more about what you’re doing with toy design and the Wicked Comics action figures?</p>
<p>CF: A friend of mine who I met on Facebook was getting into making molds at home. We thought it would be a cool idea to bring these creations to life as figures. We brainstormed and came up with different ideas on how to do it. I sculpt the figure from clay, and then I make a mold out of it. I pour plastic into the mold, and then I paint them all by hand. I make the packaging, design it on the computer, print it and glue it on the boards.</p>
<p>JR: So you’re doing all the sculpting, mold making and casting for the toys as well as creating the comics? How do you have any time to sleep!?</p>
<p>CF: Yeah, every day there’s something to do. I also do all the trailers. I do all the mail-outs. So I basically do everything.</p>
<p>JR: Many comic shops have a special section for local and indie comics. I think it would be awesome to see a Wicked Comics mini-display featuring your books and action figures together so customers see the whole immersive world you’ve created. Have you thought about getting any shops interested in something like this?</p>
<p>CF: You know, actually I did. I went to two different shops here in Florida, but they weren’t too inviting. This was when I released ClownMan. They seemed disinterested. But it’s part of the whole thing. I know that success doesn’t come overnight.</p>
<p>JR: Maybe now that you have a few more titles under your belt as well as the figures, shops will start to take notice and show some interest. All the struggling shops out there need something local, different and unique to pull in customers and differentiate themselves from the competition. Are you doing any comic book shop signings or tabling at convention artist alleys to promote and sell Wicked Comics?</p>
<p>CF: I did one comic con so far. It was Hero Hype in Miami. It was a small con, but I sold a few books there. A few of the fans who bought books there, I still keep in contact with them. One guy comes to my house every time I release a new book! But I was planning on doing a convention in April called Ultracon. So you might see me there with ClownMan, KillSwitch and DragonMasters.</p>
<p>JR: Where can fans find out more about Wicked Comics and DragonMasters online?</p>
<p>CF: Just Go to <a href=""http://www.wicked-comics.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.wicked-comics.com</a>. The site has a comics section and right now I have DragonMasters on pre-order. I haven’t gotten the print copies yet, but I should have them soon. You can purchase the pdf of DragonMasters. You can also purchase pdfs and print comics of KillSwitch and ClownMan. I also have a section for the figures.</p>
<p>JR: Are you linking the DragonMasters pre-order to the KickStarter now?</p>
<p>CF: On the bottom, I always have the current Kickstarter that’s live. I do the Kickstarters more for people to check out the company and the characters. You have to get your name out there. I use it as a way just so people can see my artwork and stories.</p>
<p>JR: Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with me today! If you’re up for it, I look forward to interviewing you again when you release your next title.</p>
<p>CF: Yeah, absolutely!</p>

<p>Hello, potential backers- I'm Mike Murphy, one-half of the creative team behind Samurai And Dinosaurs. Written by myself and drawn by powerhouse European cartoonist and comic artist, Sergio Calvet, this tale was an early collaboration of ours dating back to 2010.</p>
<p>Samurai and Dinosaurs focuses on an elite group of Samurai dispatched into the Japanese wilderness to explore a meteor that came crashing down from the heavens a little over a year prior. What they discover is a thorn in time that is bleeding one era into another. Will they survive the journey, fight some dinosaurs, and stop time from bleeding? That's where you come in.</p>
<p>Sergio and I would like to enhance the original script and art, add pages, and make the overall presentation live up to our original expectations. We're asking for your help to make this dream a reality, and in exchange for your hard-earned money, you'll receive a copy of Samurai And Dinosaurs fresh off the press.</p>
<p>If this campaign proves a success, we have stretch goals we're considering, but for now our focus is on meeting our target goal. This book is an homage to the works of Director Akira Kurosawa (Seven Samurai) and visual-effects legend Ray Harryhausen (Clash Of The Titans), is filled with gorgeous art, and we're positive you'll have a great time with it. Will you help us bring Samurai And Dinosaurs: Remastered to the world at large? Sergio and I hope that you will.</p>

</div></div>","Hello, potential backers- I'm Mike Murphy, one-half of the creative team behind Samurai And Dinosaurs. Written by myself and drawn by powerhouse European cartoonist and comic artist, Sergio Calvet, this tale was an early collaboration of ours dating back to 2010.
Samurai and Dinosaurs focuses on an elite group of Samurai dispatched into the Japanese wilderness to explore a meteor that came crashing down from the heavens a little over a year prior. What they discover is a thorn in time that is bleeding one era into another. Will they survive the journey, fight some dinosaurs, and stop time from bleeding? That's where you come in.
Sergio and I would like to enhance the original script and art, add pages, and make the overall presentation live up to our original expectations. We're asking for your help to make this dream a reality, and in exchange for your hard-earned money, you'll receive a copy of Samurai And Dinosaurs fresh off the press.
If this campaign proves a success, we have stretch goals we're considering, but for now our focus is on meeting our target goal. This book is an homage to the works of Director Akira Kurosawa (Seven Samurai) and visual-effects legend Ray Harryhausen (Clash Of The Titans), is filled with gorgeous art, and we're positive you'll have a great time with it. Will you help us bring Samurai And Dinosaurs: Remastered to the world at large? Sergio and I hope that you will.",6.0,0,"5 Campaigns

<p>The Unspeakable Text is a horror/suspense comic anthology. Each story in the series follows an ""unspeakable"" event that's been intentionally hidden from the world by supernatural forces.

<p>With this volume, we're bringing you <strong>eight short comic stories (black and white), the first act of a graphic novel (in color) and five short prose stories!</strong> It's my goal to create a cohesive, truly unique experience with UT2 and I can't be more excited to be able to bring it to you through Indiegogo! <strong>This book will have 85 to 90 pages of content!</strong></p>

This is my third crowdfunding campaign. I'm confident I will deliver the absolute best product I can. But in order to do it, we need to have the proper funding AND have contingency plans for when something goes wrong (and these things do happen). Here's a look at the breakdown:",20.0,0,"5 Campaigns

<p><b>Hello! My name is Stefie Zöhrer. I’m an eager illustrator with big dreams but no means. A couple years ago, I was able to take my time to work on my passion, creating then one of my favorite projects: “The Epic Legend of Orgnob”, the webcomic.</b></p><p><i>¡Hola! Mi nombre es Stefie Zöhrer. Soy una entusiasmada ilustradora con grandes sueños pero pocos medios. Hace un par de años, tuve la oportunidad de trabajar en mi pasión, creando en su momento uno de mis proyectos favoritos: ""La Épica Leyenda de Orgnob"", el webcomic.</i></p>
<p><b>This is a story full of adventure, inspired by countless hours of Dungeons &amp; Dragons and fantasy films. I managed to deliver several one-page weekly updates of the webcomic, before I had to drop it ‘cause I had to take a full-time job. Something many may relate to.</b></p><p><i>Esta es una historia llena de aventuras, inspirada por un sinnúmero de horas de Calabozos y Dragones y películas de fantasía. Logré publicar varias actualizaciones semanales del webcomic antes de tener que verme obligada a dejarlo por tomar un trabajo de tiempo completo. Creo es algo con lo que muchos se pueden relacionar.</i></p>
<p><b>Even with the project down, the story kept developing in my head and I kept growing fonder of it. I want you all to feel the same. What started as just two mere chapters grew all the way up to thirteen issues. The purpose of this campaign is to take the first big step into self-publishing one thousand copies of Issue # 1 and distributing them both through national comic conventions and online.</b></p><p><i>Aún con el proyecto en pausa, la historia seguía desarrollándose en mi cabeza y yo crecía más apegada a ella. Me gustaría que sintieran lo mismo. Lo que comenzó como dos pequeños capítulos pronto creció a trece volúmenes. El propósito de esta campaña es poder dar el primer paso para auto-publicar mil copias del Volumen #1 y distribuirlas en convenciones de cómic nacionales y en línea.</i></p>

<p><b>I am currently a stay-at-home mom and, even though living with the baby has been a little hard, I am finally adapting to my new life. This gives me the time to work in ilustration again, since I am taking comissions and an every now and then freelance work; more importantly, I am now working in the printed version of ""The Epic Legend of Orgnob"".</b></p><p><i>Por el momento, soy madre primeriza de tiempo completo y, aún cuando acostumbrarse a mi bebé ha sido algo laborioso, finalmente me adapto a mi nueva vida. Esto me deja con tiempo para dedicarme a la ilustración de nuevo; hago comisiones de vez en cuando y trabajos independientes. Lo más importante de todo es que ahora trabajo en una versión para formato impreso de ""La Épica Leyenda de Orgnob.""</i></p>
<p><b>This represents a great chance to redraw the art and make a printed version just how I want to. I wanted to have cleaner and more detailed drawings and, since the story is now longer and deeper, there are empty spaces to be filled and new characters to introduce.</b></p><p><i>Esto representa una grandiosa oportunidad para redibujar el cómic y llevar a cabo la versión impresa justo como siempre he querido. Siempre quise mejorar el arte -- más detallado y limpio -- y la historia ahora es más larga y amplia. Hay muchos espacios que rellenar y nuevos personajes que introducir.</i></p>
<p><b>In the image below, you can see a comparison from both the first page of the webcomic and the look of the comic book. It's easy to spot the differences in art and style; in regards to the story in the comic book, it can also be appreciated that the entire first page is merely the first two panels in the webcomic.</b></p><p><i>En la siguiente imagen, pueden ver una comparación de lo que es la primer página del webcomic y cómo se verá la historia en el formato impreso. Es fácil notar la diferencia en formato y estilo. También se nota la nueva dimensión de la historia, donde la primer página del formato impreso cubre los primeros tres páneles de la versión webcomic.</i></p>

<p><i>Para derrotar a Fest, el gran Mago Orgnob se vio obligado utilizar un poderoso encanto: su espíritu, junto con los espíritus de cada uno de los Indomables Guerreros Campeones, serían atrapados dentro de la gema de una espada muy especial, cargándola así de un poder inigualable.</i></p>

</div></div>","Hello! My name is Stefie Zöhrer. I’m an eager illustrator with big dreams but no means. A couple years ago, I was able to take my time to work on my passion, creating then one of my favorite projects: “The Epic Legend of Orgnob”, the webcomic.¡Hola! Mi nombre es Stefie Zöhrer. Soy una entusiasmada ilustradora con grandes sueños pero pocos medios. Hace un par de años, tuve la oportunidad de trabajar en mi pasión, creando en su momento uno de mis proyectos favoritos: ""La Épica Leyenda de Orgnob"", el webcomic.
This is a story full of adventure, inspired by countless hours of Dungeons & Dragons and fantasy films. I managed to deliver several one-page weekly updates of the webcomic, before I had to drop it ‘cause I had to take a full-time job. Something many may relate to.Esta es una historia llena de aventuras, inspirada por un sinnúmero de horas de Calabozos y Dragones y películas de fantasía. Logré publicar varias actualizaciones semanales del webcomic antes de tener que verme obligada a dejarlo por tomar un trabajo de tiempo completo. Creo es algo con lo que muchos se pueden relacionar.
Even with the project down, the story kept developing in my head and I kept growing fonder of it. I want you all to feel the same. What started as just two mere chapters grew all the way up to thirteen issues. The purpose of this campaign is to take the first big step into self-publishing one thousand copies of Issue # 1 and distributing them both through national comic conventions and online.Aún con el proyecto en pausa, la historia seguía desarrollándose en mi cabeza y yo crecía más apegada a ella. Me gustaría que sintieran lo mismo. Lo que comenzó como dos pequeños capítulos pronto creció a trece volúmenes. El propósito de esta campaña es poder dar el primer paso para auto-publicar mil copias del Volumen #1 y distribuirlas en convenciones de cómic nacionales y en línea.


I am currently a stay-at-home mom and, even though living with the baby has been a little hard, I am finally adapting to my new life. This gives me the time to work in ilustration again, since I am taking comissions and an every now and then freelance work; more importantly, I am now working in the printed version of ""The Epic Legend of Orgnob"".Por el momento, soy madre primeriza de tiempo completo y, aún cuando acostumbrarse a mi bebé ha sido algo laborioso, finalmente me adapto a mi nueva vida. Esto me deja con tiempo para dedicarme a la ilustración de nuevo; hago comisiones de vez en cuando y trabajos independientes. Lo más importante de todo es que ahora trabajo en una versión para formato impreso de ""La Épica Leyenda de Orgnob.""
This represents a great chance to redraw the art and make a printed version just how I want to. I wanted to have cleaner and more detailed drawings and, since the story is now longer and deeper, there are empty spaces to be filled and new characters to introduce.Esto representa una grandiosa oportunidad para redibujar el cómic y llevar a cabo la versión impresa justo como siempre he querido. Siempre quise mejorar el arte -- más detallado y limpio -- y la historia ahora es más larga y amplia. Hay muchos espacios que rellenar y nuevos personajes que introducir.
In the image below, you can see a comparison from both the first page of the webcomic and the look of the comic book. It's easy to spot the differences in art and style; in regards to the story in the comic book, it can also be appreciated that the entire first page is merely the first two panels in the webcomic.En la siguiente imagen, pueden ver una comparación de lo que es la primer página del webcomic y cómo se verá la historia en el formato impreso. Es fácil notar la diferencia en formato y estilo. También se nota la nueva dimensión de la historia, donde la primer página del formato impreso cubre los primeros tres páneles de la versión webcomic.






""The Epic Legend of Orgnob"" tells the story of the legendary Magical Sword of Orgnob, a mythical relic of epic proportions.
""La Épica Leyenda de Orgnob"" cuenta la historia de la legendaria Espada Mágica de Orgnob, una mítica reliquia de proporciones épicas.
The lands of Baldr saw times of great danger and destruction. Back then, the evil Fest was threatening to ""assimilate or annihilate"" every single living being roaming Baldr while having the terrifying army of the Realm of the Shadows under her command.
Las tierras de Baldr vivieron tiempos de peligro y destrucción. En ese entonces, la malvada Fest amenazaba con ""asimilar o aniquilar"" todo ser vivo que residiera en Baldr, con el terrible ejército del Reino de las Sombras bajo su mando.


To defeat Fest, the Great Wizard Orgnob had to cast a powerful enchantment: his spirit, along with the spirits of each of the Indomitable Champion Warriors were to be trapped inside a special sword to charge it with unmatched power.
Para derrotar a Fest, el gran Mago Orgnob se vio obligado utilizar un poderoso encanto: su espíritu, junto con los espíritus de cada uno de los Indomables Guerreros Campeones, serían atrapados dentro de la gema de una espada muy especial, cargándola así de un poder inigualable.
Unfortunately, in a decisive battle, the Magical Sword loses its wielder and gets lost in time, eventually buried in oblivion; but not before managing to contain the terrible threat that was Fest herself with a fail-safe spell.
Desgraciadamente, en una batalla decisiva, la Espada Mágica pierde a su guerrero portador y desaparece con el tiempo, sepultándose en el olvido; pero no sin antes contener con un hechizo de emergencia la terrible amenaza que representaba Fest.


Things were peaceful the following years until, by accident or destiny, Kit -- a clumsy, fearful piglet -- crosses paths with the legendary weapon. The Magical Sword of Orgnob is reactivated by this peculiar new wielder to continue the battle, releasing Fest and the evil influence of the Realm of the Shadows back into the lands of Baldr.
La paz reinó durante los siguientes años hasta que, por accidente o destino, Kit -- un cerdito torpe y temeroso -- cruza caminos con el arma legendaria. La Espada Mágica de Orgnob es reactivada para continuar la batalla con su peculiar nuevo portador, a su vez liberando a Fest y la malvada influencia del Reino de las Sombras de vuelta en las tierras de Baldr.




This is an adventure full of life and death. Kit must prove that he is worthy of the difficult task he now has before him: defeating Fest, eradicating the evil influence of the Realm of the Shadows and, the hardest part, proving the world and himself that he has the grit to save Baldr. Will he be able to comply?
Esta es una aventura llena de situaciones de vida o muerte. Kit ahora debe probar que él es digno de completar la difícil tarea que ahora encara: derrotar a Fest, erradicar la temible influencia del Reino de las Sombras y, lo más difícil aún, probarle al mundo y a sí mismo que cuenta con el valor para salvar a Baldr. ¿Podrá lograr su meta?

My goal is to turn this webcomic into a printed version so I can distribute it. I'm planning to achieve this by raising funds for the printing costs of one thousand copies of Issue # 1 and table booking costs at a couple of national comic conventions.
Mi meta es llevar el webcomic a formato impreso para poder distribuirlo. Planeo lograr esto recaudando fondos para los costos de impresión de un tiraje de mil copias del Volumen #1 y también costos de reservación de mesas de expositor en algunas de las convenciones de cómic nacionales.
The funds will be aimed to fulfill five goals:

Payment of the printing costs for one thousand copies.

Production of the perk rewards.

Booking costs to participate as an exhibitor at comic conventions.

Fees and taxes.

Work fund to complete Issue # 1.

Los fondos recaudados se utilizarán de la siguiente manera:


Pago del costo de impresión de un tiraje de mil copias.
Producción de las recompensas de los paquetes.
Costo de reservación de mesas de expositor en las convenciones de cómic.

Coming soon...



I am the daughter of an Austrian man and a Mexican woman. I grew up all over México until my family finally settled down in Monterrey, Nuevo León. In this city, I got my bachelor's in Audiovisual Languages (fancy talk for video production) at the Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León.

I've always been a doodler. Illustration is my passion. That's why I ended up spending a whole summer in NYC studying Illustration in a short intensive postgraduate course at Parsons New School of Design.

I haven't stopped drawing since.

I invite you to learn more about my work visiting the following social media platforms. Please, take a look and let me know what you think! I'm interested in hearing your opinion!









Thank you so much for your time! I hope you liked my project

I understand not everybody can contribute, but you can still help the project, just follow the 3 steps of the warrior way:

 Please share this campaign with all the people you know. The more people know about ""The Epic Legend of Orgnob"", the more chances I get to turn this campaign into a success.

If you have found a perk that suits your fancy and can afford it, I will appreciate your contribution! If you are not sure how is this done, read the prophecy:
