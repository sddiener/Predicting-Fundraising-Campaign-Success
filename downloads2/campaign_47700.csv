During one of our many adventures on the island, we discovered a road on the leeward side just north of the famous Waikiki Beach. With its encompassing jungles and warm salty air, this road was divine in its beauty. The road wound back and forth up the side of the lush Ko’olau mountain range. Every hairpin turn brought into view a wider horizon of the island. As we drove upward, I was inspired by the thought of how much pain, sweat, and pure suffering it would take to ascend Tantalus Road on a bicycle. It was then that a seed was planted; a seed that would lie dormant for several years. Fast forward to today.

We estimate it taking 5-6 weeks after the close of the campaign for us to receive the wheel orders. From there we will inspect, label, package, and ship them to you. We estimate this phase taking 2-3 additional weeks, with a goal fulfillment date of 9 weeks from the closing of the campaign.  </p><p>Progress reports will be sent out periodically, updating supporters on the status of the wheels as well as notifications of any delays.  </p><p>At the same time, we will arrange for the ordering and embroidery of the Tantalus Snap-Backs and the printing for the Tantalus Cycling Tee's. Our hope is to have these fulfilled six weeks after the close of the campaign.</p><p>Once everything is complete, we will send it all off and a few days later you guys will be ready for the racing season!</p><p>If you have any questions prior to, or after, making a pledge, do not hesitate to send us an email. You can even just email us to tell us what you think!

But right now, in order to accomplish these goals, we are utilizing the existing technology that has made race wheels a highly coveted and effective means of improving your performance, as well as existing manufacturers to supply our wheels.  It's true - we didn't engineer these wheels ourselves. But we have used them. We have raced with them. We have tested and compared them with others, and we know they are everything we believe them to be.  The process is simple. Once the wheels arrive, we inspect them to ensure that the manufacturer continues to meet our performance standards. From there, we add our touch of style, making them unique to Tantalus Cycling and a symbol of inspiration, passion, and chasing the Challenge.*Above photo --> Here we are finalizing our prototype design layout on our first set of wheels.To take on the competition, we have two different wheel depths with each depth carrying their own benefits. -- Tantalus Velox 8 -- The Tantalus Velox 8 wheels are the deepest 700c clincher wheel set we offer. Velox 8's have a rim profile coming in at 88 mm and constructed from 3K tow carbon fiber. The Velox 8's are made for pure aerodynamic performance! They weigh in at approximately 66 ounces. The first three supporters to fall in love with Tantalus Cycling and support at the $850 level will get their hands on a brand new set of Tantalus Velox 8's.  Did you miss the gun on the limited $850 perk special but you're still interested in seeing what a set of Velox 8's can do for your racing game? No worries! The $950 perk will get you up and riding at the front. *Our local hero can be seen below testing out our first set of Velox 8's. -- Tantalus Velox 6 -- The Tantalus Velox 6 clincher wheel set maximizes stability while maintaining a deep aerodynamic profile. This 700c wheel set has a rim profile depth of 60mm and is also constructed with 3K tow carbon. The shallower rim profile provides for greater stability in crosswinds. It can also be the perfect aero setup for someone not quite ready for the shiftiness that the Velox 8's can present in high winds. Velox 6's weigh in at approximately 60 ounces, thus making them a lighter wheel set than the Velox 8's. If you are racing on a course with some serious up and down terrain, the Velox 6's are a great setup. The first three to support at the $800 level will each be sent a set of Velox 6's to charge the field with! After that, anyone supporting at the $900 level will receive a set. Notice the difference in rim depth on the Velox 6's below with the Velox 8's in the picture of the local hero above? It may not seem like much visually, but that 28 mm difference can be significant if things get windy. -Both the Velox 8 and the Velox 6 are built with 20 spoke holes on the front wheel and 24 spoke holes on the rear wheel. -All Velox wheels are built with Novatec hubs and cnSpoke Aero Spokes.-You will have the option of choosing between a glossy finish or a matte finish on the 3K carbon with either wheel set. -You will have the option of choosing between a Shimano/SRAM or Campagnolo 9/10 cassette body.The Style Side of Tantalus:Every endurance athlete has a closet full of tech-tee’s and race shirts. They are often worn as a means of personal identity; a way to say “I am a triathlete; I am a cyclist; I am a runner.” However, we think there ought to be a better way to identify with this athletic subculture than simply rockin' old race tee’s in public. Our goal is to provide casual everyday-wear that maintains a sense of athleticism. Something you can wear that goes beyond a race tee; something that inspires you and shows your desire to pursue The Challenge.One of our initial goals is to encourage everyone to leave their race tees for the gym. We will be offering our Tantalus Cycling Tee (TCT). The TCT will be offered in Charcoal Grey and Kelly Green, and is available in both a male and female fit. The TCT is a dual material blend of 60% cotton and 40% Poly. This material blend carries the soft feel of cotton against your skin but the lightness of polyester. To top it off, no pun intended, we have our very first run of Tantalus Snap-Backs. This curve-billed snap-back showcases the very sharp, very edgy Ko'olau Range logo. This is the same design that can be seen on any of the Tantalus Wheelsets. The snap-backs are offered in a light grey with a black under-bill.The Style Endgame:Our vision is to create an everyday style for endurance athletes outside of the typical race-day attire. Today, apparel for endurance athletes is limited to tech-tee's, compression socks, flashy colored shoes, and awkward Lycra shorts. You can't really wear those things outside of training or racing. Tantalus Cycling is going to challenge that, and design athletic-inspired apparel that can be worn in an everyday casual environment. You will finally have an inspiring style that says ""I am a competitor...I thrive on The Challenge...""  As with everything, we are starting simple with the TCT and the Tantalus Snap-Back... but that only leaves us room to grow.I am ready to embrace The Challenge. Now what? Excellent! We are happy to hear that you believe in our mission and vision! Tantalus Cycling has a funding campaign goal to raise $7,500 in 30 days. These funds will be used to help get Tantalus off the ground and start building an initial inventory. They will also be used to expand our apparel line.Once you have committed to a pledge level, the best thing you can do is share Tantalus with your training buddies! We can't do this without your support.After you commit to pledge, we will be contacting you because there is still some information we will need from you. If you are pledging for a set of Tantalus Velox 8's or Velox 6's, we will need to find out what kind of finishing coat you prefer (Matte or Gloss), and your preference of cassette body. If you are pledging for the TCT, we will need to find out your size, color preference, and fit. Once our 30 day campaign is completed, we will go to work on fulfilling the pledges.  We will start by sending the orders for the Velox 8's and Velox 6's over to our manufacturer so they can fulfill them. We estimate it taking 5-6 weeks after the close of the campaign for us to receive the wheel orders. From there we will inspect, label, package, and ship them to you. We estimate this phase taking 2-3 additional weeks, with a goal fulfillment date of 9 weeks from the closing of the campaign.  Progress reports will be sent out periodically, updating supporters on the status of the wheels as well as notifications of any delays.  At the same time, we will arrange for the ordering and embroidery of the Tantalus Snap-Backs and the printing for the Tantalus Cycling Tee's. Our hope is to have these fulfilled six weeks after the close of the campaign.Once everything is complete, we will send it all off and a few days later you guys will be ready for the racing season!If you have any questions prior to, or after, making a pledge, do not hesitate to send us an email. You can even just email us to tell us what you think! It won't take longer than 24 hours to hear back from us at any point throughout the campaign or during fulfillment afterwards.Info@tantaluscycling.com FAQ:1. Is there a warranty policy on the Tantalus Velox wheel sets? Yes, in summary, we have a 2 year warranty for the original purchaser. The policy excludes normal wear and tear as well as misuse and crash damage. For complete warranty information, please email us at info@tantaluscycling.com!We appreciate your interest and your support for our dream of Tantalus Cycling; this wouldn't be possible without you!Matt + Laura Radniecki-- A special thank you to Tony Parrish for the design work in the creation of the Tantalus Cycling brand logo and wheel design.

More and more confronted with the impact our work have on the planet, we started to look for solutions.We realised how complicated it was to find a stylish sneakers brand that takes sustainability seriously. So we decided to act and to create a brand ourselves.    Holistic approachEvery single decision we take, every single choice we make, is made with sustainability as a driver. For 18 months, from the sole to the laces, we designed, we searched, we developed, to achieve our goals. We didn’t want to compromise, we wanted to reach the highest level of sustainability on the market, yet with a pretty cool style!  Reduce the FootprintThe fashion industry accounted for 8,1% of the global climate impact with almost 4 metric gigatons of CO2 emission in 2018. This is almost as much as all the emissions of the European union.  More than 23 billion pairs of shoes are produced every year, and each one of them releases 32kg of CO2 equivalent.  This is comparable to each one of us doing a 900km flight or a 2350km car trip each year.  If we want to keep our planet healthy, we need to reduce our footprint. And to do that we have to come up with better products. We didn’t want to just add a new product on the market, we wanted to create a concept. So we created our new norms: Sustainability is in our blood: it is the core of what we are. From material selection, choice of supplier, transport, packaging…sustainability is the fundamental of all our decisions.Transparency is our currency: We are 100% transparent, on our impact, on our suppliers and on our costs. We have nothing to hide and we are proud to show how we are working.Modernity: Our products are young, innovative and turned toward the future. We decided to come with a product that would set a new standard in the industry.  Recycle, Reduce and ReuseFrom the design, to every single component, we focused on those three words.From the moment they are designed until a consumer buys them, shoes can pass through hundreds of hands and can travel thousands of kilometers. They are made from many components. You have, of course, the upper, the laces, the labels, the sole,.. but you have also many other elements needed for the construction such as glue, thread, counters...  Eco-Design ApproachTo make the shoes we wanted, we had to rethink every single part of it. We started with our Eco-design approach, minimising that number of components. Then we searched for the right materials and for the best manufacturers in Europe. Our MaterialsOur soles are made from recycled rubber from manufacturing wastes that are crunched, melted and injected into the moulds in Portugal. Our footbed are made from recycled foam, our labels and laces are made from recycled plastic bottles, and our heel counters, toe boxes are made from recycled polyester fibres and are completely chemical free. For the assembly, we also use recycled yarns and water based glue.  3D Knitting Technology For the Upper, we used the 3D Knitting Technology. For those who are not familiar with that, it's a really complex loom that knit yarns together, to produce a single piece, ready to be assembled, shoe upper.  Knit has many advantages. It is light, breathable and confortable. But even better than that, it allowed us to create a seamless design, that reduce cutting, manufacturing wastes, and the number of components. To make Norm's knit, we use a yarn made of 100% recycled plastic bottles. The bottles are collected locally, cleaned, mechanically crushed and then transformed into threads. To make one pair of shoes, we recycle     Durability is a key aspect for Norm Our products are made using qualitative materials and manufacturing techniques to ensure a prolonged life time. But to even further increase it, the knit material is very easy to repairs with a simple needle and a thread.    We selected our suppliers to minimise the distance between them, ensure the use of local materials and reduce our carbon footprint.  Based on existing studies, we evaluated the impact of every single components we use and the traveling distance they have to do until the final products are delivered to our warehouse. The impact for one pair of Norm is only 6.5 kg of CO2 equivalent. This is 80% lower than the industry average* We collaborate with the NGO ""Seed for Life / Graine de Vie"" to plant 2 trees in Madagascar and Eastern Cap for each pair of sneakers that you buy. Together we can reforest the most needed areas, in addition to help local communities to provide employment, wood and food resources.    * based on Measuring Fashion 2018, Environmental Impact of the Global Apparel and Footwear Industries Study, Quantis We also selected only suppliers that combined great talent and great workers. Ethic is one of our core value and we made sure it was respected, at all time, through our entire supply chain.   We are not shy to tell you how our price is calculated. We ensure a decent pay to workers and we select qualitative products, which comes at a cost. Our cut is important, but don't worry it's not to fly away with it ! We think of the future and we want to continue to develop great products.   We created a stylish, durable and comfortable shoes, available for men and women in 5 different colors to match any styles. From the launch of the campaign, we will release a Polar White, an Eclipse Black, a Military Green, an Obsidian Blue and a Burgundyversion. All available from European size 36 to 47 (US 5 to 13). For more information on sizing, please check the sizing chart bellow. Polar white Eclipse Black Military Green Obsidian Blue Burgundy  Our ""Family Member"" T-shirt

It comes with 6 colors in 1 unique sneaker, so you can switch between the rich LED colors that fully light up your feet.     For the rebels and trendsetters, we created a true head-turner that doesn’t compromise comfort for style. GLOW combines unique LED footwear that looks ridiculously cool with wearable, comfortable, well-made sneakers. We created everything you wished for but never expected from LED shoes. You need sneakers that go with everything. Like, really. GLOW are so versatile that with only 1 pair, you get 6 colorful looks with vibrant LED colors. Plus the classic minimalist unlit style.THE PROBLEM In today's fast paced life, buying a pair of sneakers for every one of your outfits can cost you a small fortune. Plus all the environmental waste we cause because we go through so many pairs every year.THE SOLUTION With Glow, the 7 styles in 1 sneaker saves you the headache, cost and wardrobe space of buying multiple pairs of sneakers for all your different outfits! GLOW is also cruelty free, vegan, and sustainably produced. To flawlessly combine functionality and style, we have partnered up with the top leading developers in LED technology. This patent-protected material allowed us to find a perfect balance that ensures your feet feel fresh and comfortable all the time.  The top part of the shoe is made of three main layers. First, a super comfortable liner that protects the most sensitive feet and then a forming cloth that gives your sneakers structure and keeps them looking great. It’s all wrapped up in a high-tech optical fabric that looks like a million bucks, night and day.We made sure your sneakers are easy to clean. You only have one job: keep the switch away from water. Other than that, you can soak and brush them lightly to keep yours looking great.  Full disclosure: you can’t swim while wearing GLOW. But then again, no one would see how lit (pun intended) they are underwater, so there’s no point really. But they’re so well built, that your LED sneakers are weather resistant and you'll be worry-free if you’re caught out in the rain. The switch and charging port are securely covered so you know you’re always safe.  GLOW look and feel comfortable… because they actually are! Imagine stepping on a white, fluffy, ridiculously comfortable cloud. That’s how wearing these sneakers feels like. The high tech memory foam insoles hug your feet and keep them cozy for as long as you need, so you can focus on enjoying life. At only 10 oz (300 grams), your GLOW are as lightweight as regular everyday sneakers, yet they include all the LED tech! Take them anywhere you want to make an impression at - from the next festival you’re attending, to the championship final your team is playing in.  GLOW are versatile sneakers that adapt to your active lifestyle. If you're on the move all day or occasionally do some parkour, you'll be surprised to see how great of a friend your new sneakers are. Running, cycling or even just walking at night can sometimes feel so dangerous, you might stop going out. At GLOW, we believe that you should be free to explore the world. Simply put on your GLOWs and you won’t even have to hear the honking cars - everyone will see you in the darkest of nights and you’ll feel safer than ever. With GLOW, your creativity can be effortlessly expressed with a touch of a button. We celebrate being unique, escaping the ordinary and we definitely like to light up the world (but we usually start with a party). For the parties that seem to and do last forever, the nights you get lost in your thoughts while running and the special moments you just can’t stop having fun. GLOW makes the party in your feet last up to 14 hours. Fully recharged in only 2 hours, you’ll be ready for an encore in no time! At GLOW, we have a commitment towards sustainability. Our sneakers are made with high quality vegan leather and we are proud to announce that we are 100% cruelty free. We feel it's our responsibility to do our part to light up our world. From day to night, you can wear your GLOWs anywhere. Turn them on and change the colors on the go to transform your outfit from work to after-hours fun. Dare to be different and all your friends will love to gather around you. You’ll be the superstar who brings people together. As a parent, you would do anything for your kids. We love to see them smile, hear their delighted squeals of joy and feel their excitement - so GLOW comes in kids sizes. Now you’ll have another thing that connects you and get to enjoy your precious time together even more.Scroll down to the Sizing section to see the Shoe Sizes for kids!  WATCH THE DEMO 


 
 
 
 

  
 When do I tell you my size? Your size info will be collected through a survey after the campaign ends. But you need to measure your feet before then, to make sure you can get GLOW in your size.Our community is at the heart of everything we do. We’re building an awesome community where heroes like you, who like to stand out and be unique can connect. You’ll always have a say in our brand’s future.       We’re a bunch of sneakers-loving freaks that got hung up on a pair of LED shoes that didn’t exist. So we created it ourselves, after a year of trial, error, meetings, samples and countless prototypes. But we never gave up on our dream and we won’t give up on yours. We’re here to bring some real light in your life, in the form of high quality LED shoes!We're the dream-and-do team: we dream of creating solutions that help heroes like you shine and we do our best to achieve that!",76.0,1,"1 Campaign

We not only take pride in listening to our clients and delivering the suit and the quality they are looking for, but we hear them when they express their daily struggles with different aspects of their wardrobe. Sebastien Grey has evolved into the company it has because we take these everyday problems and find solutions for them. The lasso sock is only one of many innovative designs we have constructed to help eliminate the seemingly insignificant, yet quite bothersome problems of our daily sartorial struggles. You undoubtedly have more important issues to address than whether or not your socks have gathered at your ankles again.</p>

Initially starting with shirts, then in the future moving on to other things such as shoes, jeans, jackets and more. No more will you have to choose your clothes from the select offered at the whim of distant designers - now your are the designer of your own shirts.</p>
<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>While working on a contract in Shanghai a few years ago, Matt discovered the convenience and luxury of buying tailor made shirts from the comfort of his living room. He would choose the fabric and his personal tailor would make the shirt by either copying an existing shirt, or taking his body measurements. As this was such a simple process, with only the most basic of information required, Matt thought this would be a great idea for an online business. </p><p>To be able to choose your own fabrics, customize your collars and cuffs, and to see it evolve in 3D as you go, seemed like such a fun way to go customized shopping – and all from the convenience of the home or office. Back home in Europe, Matt met Chris - entrepreneur, author, and online marketing specialist - at a birthday party in 2011. They hit it off straight away and a few hours and a few beers later, were talking about the possibilities and potential of this business idea. 4 months later on a hot summer night – the name My Own Shirts was born - and it literally, does what it says on the tin.</p>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<p>Chris, being the expert in e-commerce and online marketing was able to source the web developers and get the framework of the business set up immediately. In parallel to this, Matt worked on setting up the operations of the business, sourcing fabrics, tailors, accessories and shipping. All of which is now in place and ready to go.</p>
<p><img alt=""Matt &amp; Chris - The Team"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/243577/files/20131205051042-DSC_7462.jpg?1386249042"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>Matt &amp; Chris - The Team</p>
<h3>The Concept</h3>
<p>By using our user friendly step-by-step design platform you get to be the creator of your own shirts. Choose from a range of the finest fabrics, select the collar and cuff you desire, maybe a contrast collar or cuff in a different fabric, pockets, epaulettes and even bottom cut. Select the exact style you want, then enter your measurements and we do rest. Every shirt is individually cut and sewn together by tailors dedicated to shirt production.</p>
<h3>The Product</h3>
<p>The product is both simple and yet something that has traditionally been out of the reach of most people, tailor-made, custom designed, made-to-measure shirts.</p><p>With MyOwnShirts, you choose the fabrics, you choose the style, you enter your exact measurements, then we make it for you and deliver it directly to your door, anywhere in the world.</p>

<h3>Delivery</h3>
<p>All perks include free shipping with DHL. </p>
<h3></h3><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have already spent over $30,000 of our own money on the website and fabrics for shirt samples and photos. If we hit our first goal of $30,000, we can buy our first 100 fabrics, but of course the more fabrics we have the more creative you can be. $45,000 will give you 150 fabrics to choose from, and $60,000 will give you 200.</p>
<p>The website is ready to launch, the workshop is ready to take your orders, now all we need is the first run of fabrics and you will have the shirts you design, made to fit you exactly. There is nothing quite like wearing your own shirt, designed by you and hand made to fit you perfectly.</p><p>If for any reason we achieve less than the $30,000 initial target, then we will launch with 90 limited edition fabrics that we have plus 10 more fabrics for each $3,000 we raise. So regardless of the outcome you will have the opportunity to enjoy your own shirts from MyOwnShirts.</p>

<p>At this time all the risks have already been overcome. There were risks that we could not get the technology right, but after 2 years of concerted hard work, that has been resolved.

Initially starting with shirts, then in the future moving on to other things such as shoes, jeans, jackets and more. No more will you have to choose your clothes from the select offered at the whim of distant designers - now your are the designer of your own shirts.
Our Story
While working on a contract in Shanghai a few years ago, Matt discovered the convenience and luxury of buying tailor made shirts from the comfort of his living room. He would choose the fabric and his personal tailor would make the shirt by either copying an existing shirt, or taking his body measurements. As this was such a simple process, with only the most basic of information required, Matt thought this would be a great idea for an online business. To be able to choose your own fabrics, customize your collars and cuffs, and to see it evolve in 3D as you go, seemed like such a fun way to go customized shopping – and all from the convenience of the home or office. Back home in Europe, Matt met Chris - entrepreneur, author, and online marketing specialist - at a birthday party in 2011. They hit it off straight away and a few hours and a few beers later, were talking about the possibilities and potential of this business idea. 4 months later on a hot summer night – the name My Own Shirts was born - and it literally, does what it says on the tin.
The Team
Chris, being the expert in e-commerce and online marketing was able to source the web developers and get the framework of the business set up immediately. In parallel to this, Matt worked on setting up the operations of the business, sourcing fabrics, tailors, accessories and shipping. All of which is now in place and ready to go.
Matt & Chris - The Team
The Concept
By using our user friendly step-by-step design platform you get to be the creator of your own shirts. Choose from a range of the finest fabrics, select the collar and cuff you desire, maybe a contrast collar or cuff in a different fabric, pockets, epaulettes and even bottom cut. Select the exact style you want, then enter your measurements and we do rest. Every shirt is individually cut and sewn together by tailors dedicated to shirt production.
The Product
The product is both simple and yet something that has traditionally been out of the reach of most people, tailor-made, custom designed, made-to-measure shirts.With MyOwnShirts, you choose the fabrics, you choose the style, you enter your exact measurements, then we make it for you and deliver it directly to your door, anywhere in the world.
You decide… you are the designer!


Hundreds of fabrics to choose from
Designed exactly the way you want it!
Every order is individually processed
Every shirt is individually hand made to your size



Shirts for both men and women to your design
With hundreds of fabrics the choice become endless




Delivery
All perks include free shipping with DHL. 
What We Need & What You Get
We have already spent over $30,000 of our own money on the website and fabrics for shirt samples and photos. If we hit our first goal of $30,000, we can buy our first 100 fabrics, but of course the more fabrics we have the more creative you can be. $45,000 will give you 150 fabrics to choose from, and $60,000 will give you 200.
The website is ready to launch, the workshop is ready to take your orders, now all we need is the first run of fabrics and you will have the shirts you design, made to fit you exactly. There is nothing quite like wearing your own shirt, designed by you and hand made to fit you perfectly.If for any reason we achieve less than the $30,000 initial target, then we will launch with 90 limited edition fabrics that we have plus 10 more fabrics for each $3,000 we raise. So regardless of the outcome you will have the opportunity to enjoy your own shirts from MyOwnShirts.

The Production Manager is Turgut with over 35 years experience of making shirts

</div></div>","All the way from around the world. This isn't merely a statement.This is what Mareverve stands for, exporting the traditional textiles of local ethnic communities around the world to promote their culture and enable them to pursue a better future. At Mareverve, we call this, 'sustainable economic empowerment'!In fact, in our fast paced developing world, old traditions are often discarded without much reflection on the cultural loss. We are well aware of the progressively globalised way of living, and we aim to take a stand for what is unique, local and deeply engraved in the lives of those who uphold their cultural heritage.                              Our products are developed through a combination of ethnic craftsmanship and aesthetic creativity. Blending our ideas with local traditions we have set ourselves to re-invent the classic Spanish espadrille according to our conception of dressing: ‘Yet, with a touch of difference’.Uniting patterns sewn by the expert weavers of communities in South America and South East Asia, together with the workmanship of shoemakers from the region of la Rioja, in Spain, we now present it with a new essence, mixtures of colors and designs!      It is through the caring work of local artisans, experts in this ultra centenary tradition, that our products achieve the highest standards of quality and durability. While being easy, creative and fun, they are brought together with fine and sustainable materials, our exceptional cottons fabrics, sewn on a natural jute sole.

positive affirmations, that help positive transformation to appear.

<p><b><font color=""#ff0000"">GOAL FOR THIS PROJECT</font></b> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>The first <i>Two Samples or Prototypes</i> of the Righteous Lover Brand Jeans Line. 
<p></p>PROTOTYPE 1 - MEN'S RELAXED STRAIGHT<br/>PROTOTYPE 2 - WOMEN'S LOW-RISE TROUSER 
<p></p>A <i>prototype</i> is one of the first units manufactured of a product, which is tested so that the design can be changed if necessary before the product is manufactured commercially. Once designs and fabrics are chosen, a first sample of the jeans is created and then tried on a model to see what adjustments to the design need to be made. This also helps designers to narrow their choices of designs to offer for sale. After the final adjustments and selections have been made, samples of the article using the actual materials are sewn and produced. <b>That is what this project is for</b>.

<p><b><font color=""#ff0000"">THE RIGHTEOUS LOVER STORY</font></b> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>I came up with the idea of the Righteous Lover Brand Jeans line in March 2009. My main purpose is to create a denim line perfect for independent people who follow their own unique path in life and to help them express their individuality through the Righteous Lover brand. <b>Righteous Lover will specialize in innovative finishes, detailed stitching, unique studs, buttons, and cool and unique accessories such as (wallet chain, mini-flask, etc.) </b>Our price point will be $125-$350 and will be in the market with such brands as True Religion, Diesel, Evisu and my favorite brand Dsquared.

<p><b><font color=""#ff0000"">OUR TEAM</font></b> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>I am so lucky to be surrounded by a talented group of people who share my vision of what this line could be. Thinles Chosdup, Fashion Designer, will be consulting with me on every detail. Thinles was recently featured in Vogue India and was named as a GenNext emerging young designer. When it comes to thinking out-of-the box, this new age designer rules the roost. Thinles celebrates denim as it ought to be celebrated: Ingeniously and without restraint. 
<p></p>
<img alt="""" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.righteouslover.com/images/thinlessketch.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><p></p>
<p>I will also be working with Don Valasquez at L.A. Garment Wash for the actual manufacturing of the prototypes. On the marketing side my team also includes Robert Lee of Methane Studios which has produced limited edition screen prints since 1998, and designed for such acts as Dave Matthews Band, Wilco, Kings of Leon, Eric Clapton, Sonic Youth and a hundred others. Robert Lee is also the designer of the Righteous Lover Logo. </p>

<p> </p>
<p> ""Pared down to its barest essence, Righteous Lover Denim is in the business of finding beauty in imperfection. It's simple, slow, and uncluttered-and it reveres authenticity above all. Righteous Lover Denim is flea markets, not warehouse stores; aged wood, not Pergo; rice paper, not glass. It celebrates cracks and crevices and all the other marks that time, weather, and loving use leave behind."" </p>
<p></p>We will give special emphasis to creating innovative finishes and pay close attention to every detail. We will look at each pair of jeans we design and create each pair as a work of art and always have some cool accessory added to each pair of jeans whether it is a cool wallet chain, a hidden pocket, a mini-flask, a bottle opener, etc.

<div>Bensly will always continue to hold true to our core values, which guided us through the creation of a company we feel genuinely proud to operate – and one our customers feel proud to support. It’s still a challenge to manage such a diverse global network, but we take care to be present at every step. To get everyone involved. To hear their voices. To hear yours. To ensure ecological sustainability, encourage social responsibility, and deliver the premium apparel you’ve come to expect while making positive change in the world we share. And together?

<div>Bensly is the evolution of The Comfortable Club, launched in 2014; a small company manufacturing underwear for men and women. Then, as now, we believe in providing better service and smarter sourcing by cutting out middlemen to take full control of our supply chain. While undergarments remain the core of our global business, today we’ve expanded to a full line of premium sold exclusively online. Our company values and product design reflect minimalistic style: simplicity, utility, and comfort. More importantly, Bensly believes strongly in sustainability.</div>

We’ve created something truly special. We've set an example, and we thank you for being a part of it.</p>
<p>From farming practices to fiber production, shipping, and dyeing of fabrics, in the apparel industry opportunities abound to make a strong and lasting impact on the world we share. Whether that’s a positive or negative impact depends entirely on a company’s choices – how it chooses to source its raw materials and the criteria they demand be applied in production. Many choose profit over all else, which is difficult for us to understand.</p>
<p>The TENCEL® branded fiber we used in our yarn is grown sustainably on South African Eucalyptus forest plantations that use land unsuitable for growing food crops. Our Pima cotton is grown in America on farms adhering to the highest standards of environmental protection.</p>
<p>What price can one put on clean air, water, and land? We believe a healthy Earth to be genuinely priceless and so, over the past 14 months, we’ve invested every available resource; every second we have, to make sure Bensly makes nothing but a positive impact on our world and its many inhabitants.</p>
<p>Our fabrics are produced in a closed-loop system that recycles 100% of solvents used, keeping harmful chemicals safely sequestered from any environment they could harm and reducing, for our part, the overall demand for production or extraction of such chemicals. And we do not add harmful metals in any part of our production process.</p>

<p>After a worldwide journey searching the most sustainable performance fabrics, we started looking for the best cutters and sewers – those who share our passion for eco-friendliness and can prove it. We began to consciously reduce our shipping footprint by splitting our supply chain to prioritize efficiency. Today, we work with a top fabric mill in Zhejiang, a Guangzhou facility for cutting, sewing, and packaging, and local mills and cutters right here in California. Our facilities are unmatched in the apparel industry. And, equally importantly, their hiring practices and employee-enrichment programs ensure workers get treated with the respect, fairness, and opportunity they deserve. They’re our kind of people, and we’re proud to partner with them.</p>
<p><strong>ZHEJIANG</strong> PRODUCES: ELITE SERIES FABRIC.</p>
<p>This one was simple: not only does our textile enjoy a first-rate reputation in the industry, famous for its award-winning exports around the world; it was specifically recommended to us. We decided to take a closer look.</p>
<p>This industry-leader knitting facility has been producing top-quality fabrics for a range of established global brands for decades. Their awarded dedication to outstanding environmental stewardship and excellence in workplace environments makes them a perfect match for Bensly.</p>
<p><strong>GUANGZHOU</strong> CUT &amp; SEWS: ELITE SERIES BOXER BRIEFS.</p>
<p>After months of travel and many disappointments, we were lucky enough to encounter our knitter. Now we know they’re widely considered to be the world’s best manufacturer of undergarments with a team of over 500 people currently produces our entire underwear collection.</p>
<p>We asked friends, apparel makers, and even dealt with their competitor. Turns our fabric supplier, who had recommended a few of our dye houses, was able to connect us to the factory. After a few conversations and a visit to Guangzhou – to say we were pleased with the craftsmanship and hiring practices would be an understatement – we started prototyping immediately.</p>
<p><strong>LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA </strong>PRODUCES: ELITE SERIES FABRIC </p>
<p>We didn’t have to go far to find our fabric supplier, not far outside downtown LA. Its owner, Mr. Barry, has been in the LA garment industry for over 20 years and we’ve built a strong relationship with him – in fact, he’s been instrumental to our success.</p>
<p>Our company simply would not exist today without the support of this facility. Their focus on sustainability matches our own, and when we discovered they are one of the few local fabric mills with a dedicated product development team for sourcing and strategy, we knew we had to meet them. We’ve stuck with them since.</p>
<p><strong>SOUTH EL MONTE, CALIFORNIA</strong> CUT &amp; SEWS: ELITE SERIES FITTED TEE </p>
<p>Our first stop was close to home – just 20 minutes outside downtown Los Angeles. Being so close by, we visit this facility every week and have forged a strong relationship with Mr. Jay, factory owner, who has been in the LA garment industry for over 25 years.</p>
<p>In our initial phases of production, we worked with four different vendors to produce a single T-shirt. This process was long and inefficient, and when we discovered we could streamline it without compromising quality thanks to Mr. Jay, we were ecstatic. Impressed by his high standards of workmanship and the positive environment his team creates for their workers, we knew right away: we need these people on board. Today, we’re proud to say we know the people who create our products firsthand – and, in many cases, by first name.</p>

<p>A little over 2 years ago, we launched what felt like a simple mission: to deliver unbeatable undies at the best price. Easy. Comfortable Club was born, and our mission accomplished. But even with awesome reviews on over 100,000 units shipped, success alone wasn’t enough to inspire us. Every day that we spent not improving our products, and their impact in the world, was a wasted day. Thus began our real journey…</p>
<p>It took 12 months of blood, sweat, and more than a few tears to overhaul production processes from start to finish. Miguel and his team learned more than they ever thought they could about trees, textiles, hardware, body shapes, movements, styles, and aesthetics.

And today, at Bensly, mindfulness and sustainability form the core of everything we do.</p>

<h2>Risks and challenges</h2>
<p>This is our 4th campaign. We've shipped over 100,000 units to backers and customers all over the world. Our manufacturers are close partners and friends, and we're already in production with a set delivery time-frame in place. Our fulfillment centers have the capacity to ship over 25,000 items per day, so you can rest assured that your items will ship as soon as they're in stock. You'll receive automated tracking information too. We've got production, quality control, customer service, exchanges, and tracking handled beautifully. You're well taken care of!</p>
<p>Supply Chain Risk: We're incredibly proud of our supply chain, and have a lot of confidence that we can make what we say we'll make, when we say we'll make it. But know what? Sometimes 10 shipping containers of product get stuck for a random inspection at customs. We pad our schedule for these kind of things, but sometimes not enough. Whatever happens, we'll get through it together. We promise.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>This project was previously funded on Kickstarter 2 days prior to this launch - I am giving the watch community a second chance to obtain one at the discounted price! The watches will be in production 2 weeks from now , and delivered Early February.</i></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><i> Warranty</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Each Oceanica Timepiece will come with a hand signed one year warranty card by me. In case, anything should go wrong with the mechanics or construction in that one year period, you are covered 100%.</i></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> I, myself always look around for the best deals on watches with the highest quality components, movements, and of course the best looking watches. I am essentially bringing this product directly to the end consumer by cutting out the middleman or retail outlet, allowing for a very good value and truly outstanding timepiece which can be cherished by other watch enthusiasts all around the globe.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>For just $265 ( $100 off of retail ) </p>
<ul>
<li>The $3000+ funding will go directly to producing these watches, boxes, and shipping them off to. my backers, while I will not make profit - I will still be able to launch this watch in a production batch!</li>
<li>Each watch will come with a beautiful leatherette travel case, 1 year hand-signed warranty card, and your watch!</li>
<li>If I do not reach my goal, the funds will be used to still deliver a watch to each backer that has so generously embarked on this journey with me!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You single handedly will help launch a brand new watch model !</p>
<ul><li>I did make a batch of dive watches last year, and they all sold out within 2 months! I have secure manufacturing, distribution, and quality control checks!</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I have secured manufacturing in Hong Kong and I have no doubt that the watches will be delivered and manufactured properly. I will be doing quality control checks myself, which is the right thing to do, and shipping myself from the USA. It should be a smooth ride from here on if this project is funded!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">     <strong>   About the watch </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The OP-1 is influenced by the original Flieger watches of the mid 1900's and these watches were actually used as tools and flight instruments by the military, and airforce. These watches were essential for survival and telling the time at a quick glance with the easy legibility of this dial ""B"" style layout. In earlier times, the pilot watches were larger - up too 50MM meant to be worn over flight jackets. In modern times, these style of timepieces have been slandered and slimmed down to adapt to the era in which we currently live in. Lastly, the upside down triangle with a dot to the left and right at 12:00 allows for easy legibility and quick reference during the night or day, just like the very first pilot watches.</strong></p>

<p>                                                                     Case Construction and Finish</p>
<p>The OP-1 is comrpised of Marine grade 316L Solid Stainless steel which is corrosion resistant and holds up very well over the years. The case itself is 40MM in diameter, 10MM in thickness, and 47MM Lug to Lug distance. The lug width measures a standard 20MM and can fit many different straps. The finishing is all brushed and feels soft to my hands, which is good. The crystal used is a Genuine Anti-Reflective coated Sapphire crystal on the front of the watch, and the back of the watch. The small onion crown which is so typical of flinger style watches is sized fo the 40MM case so it does not bother you on the wrist also. The case is essentially three pieces - the case - smooth bezel - and screw down caseback which is water resistant to 5ATM or 50M. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>                                                 Genuine High Quality Black Leather Straps</p>
<p>The black leather strap I chose because overall I think It fits the characteristics of a pilots timepiece, and it is comfortable on my wrist. The strap is 20MM and contains enough holes to accommodate a larger wrist. There is no break-in period required with this strap , and it will fit on the wrist with ease straight out of the box. Being a watch lover myself, a stiff strap is a big no-no for me.</p>

<p>The OP-1 will ship inside a leatherette case on a pillow with your one year warranty card included. I chose to keep it simple, after doing a survey asking many watch collectors about boxes.

</div></div>","This project was previously funded on Kickstarter 2 days prior to this launch - I am giving the watch community a second chance to obtain one at the discounted price! The watches will be in production 2 weeks from now , and delivered Early February.
 
 
 Warranty
Each Oceanica Timepiece will come with a hand signed one year warranty card by me. In case, anything should go wrong with the mechanics or construction in that one year period, you are covered 100%.
 
Short Summary
 I, myself always look around for the best deals on watches with the highest quality components, movements, and of course the best looking watches. I am essentially bringing this product directly to the end consumer by cutting out the middleman or retail outlet, allowing for a very good value and truly outstanding timepiece which can be cherished by other watch enthusiasts all around the globe.

What We Need & What You Get
For just $265 ( $100 off of retail ) 

The $3000+ funding will go directly to producing these watches, boxes, and shipping them off to. my backers, while I will not make profit - I will still be able to launch this watch in a production batch!
Each watch will come with a beautiful leatherette travel case, 1 year hand-signed warranty card, and your watch!
If I do not reach my goal, the funds will be used to still deliver a watch to each backer that has so generously embarked on this journey with me!


The Impact
You single handedly will help launch a brand new watch model !
I did make a batch of dive watches last year, and they all sold out within 2 months! I have secure manufacturing, distribution, and quality control checks!

Risks & Challenges
I have secured manufacturing in Hong Kong and I have no doubt that the watches will be delivered and manufactured properly. I will be doing quality control checks myself, which is the right thing to do, and shipping myself from the USA. It should be a smooth ride from here on if this project is funded!
        About the watch 
The OP-1 is influenced by the original Flieger watches of the mid 1900's and these watches were actually used as tools and flight instruments by the military, and airforce. These watches were essential for survival and telling the time at a quick glance with the easy legibility of this dial ""B"" style layout. In earlier times, the pilot watches were larger - up too 50MM meant to be worn over flight jackets. In modern times, these style of timepieces have been slandered and slimmed down to adapt to the era in which we currently live in. Lastly, the upside down triangle with a dot to the left and right at 12:00 allows for easy legibility and quick reference during the night or day, just like the very first pilot watches.



 
*Please note all photos are 1:1 of what the actual watch you will receive will look like and NOT Photoshopped*
        Available in Two Different Dial Colors
MATTE BLACK / SUNBURST BLUE 

 
The Blue dial contains a sunburst effect and the black dial variant has a matte finish. Both dials are classic and traditional in the sense of pilot watches of the past and deeply influenced by them. The layout used on these dials is called the ""B"" style layout. This layout with large numerals allows for easy time reading at a quick glance, whether it be night or day. It is extremely practical and useful in everyday situations, from my experience. The dial also contains sword like hands filled with C3 SuperLuminova, as well as the markers and numerals.
 

 
 Movement 

I chose to utilize a very robust, accurate, and reliable high beat automatic movement. This means , no batteries - the watch actually runs with the movement of your hand or by winding the watch via Crown. The movement I chose is the Miyota 90S5. This movement has a power reserve of 42 hours, contains 24 jewels, and has a hand winding, and hacking capability. ( When crown is pulled - Second hand stops to set exact time ). It is also a beautiful movement to look at whilst running which can be seen through the Sapphire exhibition caseback on the back of the watch. The movement also has a beat rate of 28,800 Vibrations Per Hour allowing for an extremely smooth sweep of the seconds hand. This movement does not feature a date, and allows for a clean overall user experience.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>As a long-time fan of Alice in Wonderland, Sue has endeavored to capture and convey the whimsy and charm of the Alice stories in her newest line of heirloom quality jewelry. Each piece has been expertly carved in wax to maximize detail and the expressiveness of the characters, before casting in sterling silver or bronze. The line will start with necklaces, but if there is sufficient interest Sue already has plans to expand it to include earrings, bracelets, and rings, featuring a range of different Alice in Wonderland characters and scenes.

Hello,  my name is
Dwight Van Slyke and I am the creator of the Hat Leash. Growing up in San Diego surfing has always been
part of my life, however the sun damage to my scalp, face and forehead became
painful whenever I went surfing without protection.  After many years of losing hat after hat to multiple wipe outs, I decided to create a product that would be easy to keep track of and protect me from the sun and glare at the same time.
The Hat Leash was designed with
surfers and other active water sport enthusiasts in mind.  
The product consists of three
parts; a leash, arm band, and a hat. All three components work together to
protect against loss of the Hat, sun exposure, heat, glare and some protection
if one were to get hit in the head.  The
bright colors also make it easier for others to see you in the water or from
shore.
The Leash that attaches the Hat
to the Arm Band is made from a variety of materials such as Polyester webbing, Para cord, filament
or nylon line with beads, and other small art objects.  The braided cords have an assortment of
the decorative items woven into them.  We are always looking for ways to better the look and durability of the Hat Leash so new designs are just around the corner.



Our Hat Leashes are very
different from the rest; they are very colorful.  The Hats and Leashes are color
coordinated, making them a fashion statement as well. We also carry a variety of colors. 
Let's just talk about surfing for now.  At all the professional events 
the riders have advertising everywhere except their heads.  Will the

Jobs For The Community
I have found some warehouses that boarder neighborhoods that are economically depressed.  My plan is to recruit from the surrounding area so that they could  walk to work, or a short bus ride.  This work can be done by just about anyone and we will try to attract the disabled, seniors and some school kids as well.  Employing and training people that may have a difficult time finding employment.

   The Impact
Sun protection, damage to your eyes from the glare, some protection if you get hit in the head and it is easier to see you when you are in the water.  Making people's lives better & healthier.  
This is a trend setting product as hats have not been worn for surfing or other similar activities in the past and based on the responses from the surfers, they are ready for the Hat Leash.

We are trying hard to be mostly made in the United States.
   Risks & Challenges
As we all know with any new business venture there are always risks to be considered.  The only risk I can see here is; not enough people buy a Hat Leash.  But based on the reception so far this risk appears to be very low.  The hats, leashes, and the arm band are mostly made in the United States and assembled here as well.  The items that make up the Hat Leash are readily available from large distributors/manufacturers and labor is very available.

  Risks & Challenges
Logistics is a major challenge which 7akwa Clothing's must overcome, after the customer buys the T-shirt either on-line or by coming to the shop, merchandises must be delivered not only to the customer but to the person in need too. To avoid doubling the work on our logistics team the second T-shirt could be handled to a person in need by the customer him/herself to feel the joy and fulfillment that giving spirits enjoy.

For togging the globe, 7akwa intend to collaborate with global organizations to make sure that all beneficiaries are people in need.

<p>I want to tell you a little about
myself and my clothing line.My name is Alisa Correa I'm a self-taught artist,
and fashion designer with a big dream.My dream is to create a successful independently owned artistic street wear line for women.I decided one day out of the blue in college to try to make that dream come true so I took a leap of faith and
 I taught myself to screen print with a small silk screening kit and a 
printer. I started off small by printing my very own t-shirts. I realized after creating my collection I wanted to dress a woman from head to toe  and 
expanded to skirts, leggings, tanks. and shorts. I spend my waking hours designing clothes and researching and looking for inspiration. I am here to share my vision for my Fall/Winter 2013 Aztec Warrior collection with you.</p>

<br/><p>Enough
 about me here is a little about
my clothing line. Alias Pink means  many things such as individuality, 
artistic expression and passion.Alias Pink Clothing is an artistic
street wear line created in 2010 for women. Alias Pink is well known by 
many for its unique artistic graphics. This line is more than just your 
average clothing line it’s the perfect blend of fashion and art. <br/></p>

little background on the collection you  will help launch. The
title for the Alias Pink Fall/Winter 2013 line is the ""Aztec
Warrior"" collection.I wanted to
connect with my Hispanic roots and examine the Aztec culture that existed such a
long time ago. I was extremely inspired by the artwork and
history of Mexico and the Aztec people.<br/></p>
<p>This collection is heavily inspired
by Aztec tribal art and the Aztec warrior culture. One aspect of  the warrior
culture that stood out to me was the warrior’s battle uniforms. The warriors
tend to wear the skin of the animals and helmets from the animals skulls to embody that animal’s spirit and power. I
referenced various Aztec tribal designs and various animal markings to create
the patterns for my collection. I interpreted the designs through my artistic
filter and modernized them.</p>
<p> I wanted my collection to be an artistic and
modern version of the Aztec warrior uniform.The woman who wears the Aztec
Warrior collection will feel like an empowered warrior walking down the concrete jungles of the
world. <br/></p>

<br/><p><b>Why does it cost 9,700 dollars to produce your line?</b><br/></p>
<p>Good question why so much to produce my collection. As a small business owner I realized I want to support local business owners too. We all know the cost of doing business locally isn't cheap. I have reached out to businesses all over California in areas of clothing production, screen printing, graphic designing, and promotional material to make this collection a reality. I have chosen to work with companies that are at he top in their fields and can provide topnotch services. <br/></p>

</span></span></span></span>Alias Pink is so original because a
majority of the designs are hand drawn  and never imitated. I strive
for originality and never imitate my references directly.The inspiration for the
line changes often so you will never see the same graphics recycled<b>. </b>
I have done all this on my own with little overhead and help as 
possible.  I use my inspiration
as a foundation to build upon. You will also find various original dying
techniques and on occasion hand painted details.A few of my designs have hand dyed
details with are unique to each shirt. No shirt will be the exactly the same as
the other.<span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><p><b>Hand drawn or computer created I strive for originality.</b></p>

I want to tell you a little about
myself and my clothing line.My name is Alisa Correa I'm a self-taught artist,
and fashion designer with a big dream.My dream is to create a successful independently owned artistic street wear line for women.I decided one day out of the blue in college to try to make that dream come true so I took a leap of faith and
 I taught myself to screen print with a small silk screening kit and a 
printer. I started off small by printing my very own t-shirts. I realized after creating my collection I wanted to dress a woman from head to toe  and 
expanded to skirts, leggings, tanks. and shorts. I spend my waking hours designing clothes and researching and looking for inspiration. I am here to share my vision for my Fall/Winter 2013 Aztec Warrior collection with you.

  
Enough
 about me here is a little about
my clothing line. Alias Pink means  many things such as individuality, 
artistic expression and passion.Alias Pink Clothing is an artistic
street wear line created in 2010 for women. Alias Pink is well known by 
many for its unique artistic graphics. This line is more than just your 
average clothing line it’s the perfect blend of fashion and art. 


I want to know more please tell me about the project I am funding!As the creator I want to give you a
little background on the collection you  will help launch. The
title for the Alias Pink Fall/Winter 2013 line is the ""Aztec
Warrior"" collection.I wanted to
connect with my Hispanic roots and examine the Aztec culture that existed such a
long time ago. I was extremely inspired by the artwork and
history of Mexico and the Aztec people.
This collection is heavily inspired
by Aztec tribal art and the Aztec warrior culture. One aspect of  the warrior
culture that stood out to me was the warrior’s battle uniforms. The warriors
tend to wear the skin of the animals and helmets from the animals skulls to embody that animal’s spirit and power. I
referenced various Aztec tribal designs and various animal markings to create
the patterns for my collection. I interpreted the designs through my artistic
filter and modernized them.
 I wanted my collection to be an artistic and
modern version of the Aztec warrior uniform.The woman who wears the Aztec
Warrior collection will feel like an empowered warrior walking down the concrete jungles of the
world. 








                
                                       Aztec Culture         
 Aztec Warriors                Aztec tribal Art         Animal Markings

Why does it cost 9,700 dollars to produce your line?
Good question why so much to produce my collection. As a small business owner I realized I want to support local business owners too. We all know the cost of doing business locally isn't cheap. I have reached out to businesses all over California in areas of clothing production, screen printing, graphic designing, and promotional material to make this collection a reality. I have chosen to work with companies that are at he top in their fields and can provide topnotch services. 

Alias Pink is so original because a
majority of the designs are hand drawn  and never imitated. I strive
for originality and never imitate my references directly.The inspiration for the
line changes often so you will never see the same graphics recycled. 
I have done all this on my own with little overhead and help as 
possible.  I use my inspiration
as a foundation to build upon. You will also find various original dying
techniques and on occasion hand painted details.A few of my designs have hand dyed
details with are unique to each shirt. No shirt will be the exactly the same as
the other.Hand drawn or computer created I strive for originality.

<p>Nubagg is a very simple trash can. Every time that we present the product to someone (without the bag) the number one question is ""what is that?"". All it takes to change a ""what is that?"" to a ""WOW"" is to place a bag on it, and just like magic, it makes sense.</p>
<h2><strong>ADOPT-A-BAG</strong></h2>
<p>Although we are not out to save the world, nor we consider ourselves environmentalists, Nubagg is a very green product by nature because it has been designed to reuse any plastic bag that is handed out for free at grocery stores, pharmacies, convenience stores, gas stations, retail outlets, etc. </p>

<p>With that said, we came up with the Adopt-A-Bag Program (no bag left behind). The goal here is to make use of these free bags instead of throwing them away, and of course to save money since you no longer have to buy plastic bags to throw your trash. A family of four can make up the cost of a Nubagg within two months of reusing these free bags.</p>
<h2><strong>DESIGN HIGHLIGHTS &amp; BENEFITS</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>100% RECYCLED</strong></h3>
<p>Nubagg not only reuses millions of plastic bags, but it is made of 100% recycled metal. These two characteristics make it the most eco-friendly trash can available in the market.</p>
<h3><strong>HANG-THE-BAG DESIGN</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>FREAKISHLY LIGHTWEIGHT</strong></h3>
<p>At barely 1lb (one pound), Nubagg its the lightest trash can in its category. What weights 1lb? A loaf of bread, a dozen eggs... and Nubagg!  </p>
<h3><strong>VIRTUALLY ODOR-FREE</strong></h3>
<p>Because of its metaphysically wrinkle-free metal body, Nubagg is virtually odor free compared to conventional trash cans. What's the trick? Metal does not absorb odors like plastic does.</p>
<h3><strong>HASSLE-FREE CLEANING TECHNOLOGY</strong></h3>
<p>Washing trash cans is so old-school. Enjoy our built-in, high-tech and hassle-free cleaning technology: wipe it. That's right, most people forget about this tedious task, but trash-cans have to be cleaned periodically so they don't smell and become unhygienic. Cleaning Nubagg is easy as pie.</p>
<h2><strong>MODELS &amp; COLORS</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Nubagg Classic &amp; Nubagg Mini</strong></h3>
<p>Nubagg’s standalone unit, the Nubagg Classic, is the lightest trash can in its class, weighting barely 1lb (less than a loaf of bread). Its unique structural design makes it not only a conversational piece, but can hold as much weight as the bag itself can hold (and then some).</p>

<p>Nubagg Mini goes where others can't. Designed with small spaces in mind, this versatile wall-mount unit fits everywhere. The Mini is half the weight of the Nubagg Classic, and yet it has all of its unique characteristics and key benefits.</p>
<h3><strong>2 Timeless Colors, Unlimited Possibilities</strong></h3>
<p>Although Nubagg can be done in practically any imaginable color, we plan to start production in two timeless colors: silver gray and white. Both of these colors fit perfectly in any kitchen, bathroom, mud room, laundry room, garage, office, etc. As a Kickstarter pledger, you will have the opportunity to choose one of these two colors, or a combination of both if you go for one of our combos.</p>

  echo/neutra is a new Italian brand devoted to Mechanical Watches Enthusiasts and is born from the meeting of its 2 founders: Nicola Callegaro, Designer and Communication Consultant and Cristiano Quaglia, Aerospace Engineer with a specialization in Propulsion Systems.echo/neutra combines our two great passions: mechanical watchmaking and mountains, especially the Dolomites, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2009. Here from childhood we spent a lot of time with our families and still today we admire its special ""Raw beauty"".  
The Dolomites, backdrop and soul of our echo/neutra line of watches. echo/neutra’s new line of watches has been inspired by the Dolomites, the place where our idea and project come to life and which still excites us and challenges our creativity each day.These awesome mountains stir high emotions and breathe new life into us. And they never get old. We always discover a new place, a different landscape, a new challenge. Here the rush of emotions is ever changing as Mother Nature reveals its many different facets: powerful, imperious, antagonistic while at the same time silent, ethereal and romantic.Tre Cime di Lavaredo

 SWISS MADE WATCHES - BUILT TO LAST.A Swiss Made Watch is a superior product made from high-quality components. Such a focus on quality makes Swiss Made Watches an excellent choice, whether you are a first-time buyer or a watch collector: they're the most valued and respected watches in the market.A Swiss Made Watch is not just a temporary accessory, a fashion fad or a trend: it can last for generations. From the movement to the case, the quality of materials distinguishes Swiss Made Watches from other brands.The 316L surgical grade steel of the case is top resistant to corrosion and can be re-polished when scratched. The sapphire crystal has an incredibly high scratch resistance, in order to keep your watch clear for many years. The movements of the AVERAU are hand-assembled. This, combined with the use of metal gears, ensures great quality internal mechanisms.  Swiss Made Watches are designed to last and the use of high-quality materials enables watchmakers to repair scratched or broken parts. 
 We want to realize Swiss Made watches to provide to our customer the best quality without compromises. 
 
For a long time, we have looked for the best craft workshop, the one which better embraces our high qualitative standards.The choices made by our partner through the years, justify and partly help to understand how he arrived at today high-quality production. The business location is in an old countryside house which lodges in perfect harmony the production workshop, the offices and an old stable with several horses. An old hayloft has become a luminous laboratory, the cows' stable has turned into a spacious and functional office. The actual production comes from the traditional techniques of leather manufacturing, which have been then transferred to the world of watch straps.The strength of our proposal is the quality of our straps: the leathers we use are the best ones in the Italian market, the endurance of the parts (attach bend, fastening buckle, etc) is insured by our know-how. The finishings go from the handmade remborded edges to the burnishing and waxing of the cut edges and the seams are of the saddle type.

We wanted to offer the best possible lenses, while maintaining an affordable price. We quickly selected German Optical Powerhouse Zeiss®, reputed for their outstanding lens quality in many fields (camera, telescope, prescription and sunglass). We met several times with them (thanks for your patience Mariele!) and even went in Italy to convince them (thank you Pietro) to let us use their amazing lenses, even if our price point was going to be well under their usual brand requirements.  We like to think they liked our objective of offering their great lenses to a wider audience. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">LENSES TECHNICAL SPECS</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">     » Producer: Carl Zeiss Vision, Italy</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">     » Material: Polyamid (Nylon-type) w/ gradient tint<span><br/></span>     » Base 6 curvature</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">     » Filter </span>Category: 2 (suitable for driving use)<br/><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">     » </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Backside Anti-reflection coating<span><br/></span><span>     » Back side and Front side Ri-Pel™ super-hydrophobic coating<span><br/></span>     » 100% UV-A and UV-B protection<span><br/></span><span>     » Optional polarizing filter</span></span></span></p><p>
</p><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">«Comfortable» lenses<span><br/></span></b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The quality of lenses goes well beyond the protection from UV rays. Today, most pharmacy sunglasses will offer a good enough protection from UV.  The difference rather lies in the <b>visual comfort and accuracy </b>the lenses will provide. Such qualities come from high optical quality, only obtained with highly rigorous manufacturing processes and best raw materials. High quality lenses result in less optical distortion, and a smoother transmission of light, hence providing a more accurate perception of details and depth, and sort of a «relaxing» effect to the eyes.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">To ensure a perfect visual comfort in all situation, we decided to add an anti-reflect coating to the back of the lenses, to eliminate disturbing glare that may sometime occur when lights bounce on the lenses from the side or from the back.</span><br/></p>
<p><b>Super easy to clean<span><br/></span></b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">As an extra, we also added Zeiss' Ri-Pel™ treatment to all our lenses. This super-hydrophobic treatment «seals» the surface of the lenses, so water beads and roll off (oil and dust slip off the surface as well), making the lenses much easier to clean. The treatment also provide an additional scratch-resistance.</span></p><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><b>THE FRAME<span><br/></span></b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">As we over stated by now (...), we want our first product to be the embodiment of our philosophy of «less is more». So we simply remove all we could to only keep the bare essential. Our frames are made out of a single piece of high-end Japanese stainless steel (this is the same steel used to make high precision chirurgical instruments such as scalpels). Hinges? Screws? Soldering? No need, so we got rid of.</span></p><p><b>Wide unobstructed field-of-view</b><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span>The frame curvature offers a wrap-style protection so sunlights won't get in from the sides.

lenses):         Simply the most comfortable pair of frames you’ll ever own.     » Lenses by Carl Zeiss® Vision, usually only offered on $200+
retail sunglasses:           Ultimate comfort for your eyes.     » Lifetime warranty: 
If your frames ever break (you’ll have to try very hard...),         we’ll
replace it. Period.     » Home TRY-ON kit included with all pledges: Try ALL our
models before         setting your choice.     » Simple-most design. Every gram of matter has its function.
        Nothing superfluous.     » Amazing value. Prices won't be that low after the campaign. Now is the time         to jump on it! Even more so at EARLY BIRD SPECIAL PRICES!* Now Featured on Crowdfundfusion.com* Our website www.lexparsimoniae.co is also featured on   www.strikingly.com (gallery section)

 Home Try-On kit     (included with all pledges)Try ALL THE 7 Different shapes BEFORE choosing which model suits you
best.
How? Easy. Buy a plane ticket to Montreal (YUL). Take a cab from airport to 406 St-Eloi in old Montreal. Ring Suite 200. Climb up the stairs. Meet us. Have a bagel (the bests are from Montreal...). Try the prototype frames we have. (please call to schedule before, just in case we are off that day...).
OR
Go to the post. Wait until you get your Try-on kit (included in all pledges - will ship about 2 weeks after campaign ends). Open it. Try all the shapes in the comfort of your pajamas. Look at yourself in the mirror from all angles, extensively. Take pictures, ask friends. Don't listen to friends. Make your choice. 
Our collection has 7 different models to choose from. We
will send a TRY-ON kit (2 weeks after campaign’s closing) to ALL our campaign
supporters. The Kit includes 7 real-size cutout shapes, and 1 information leaflet.
Cut out of cardboard, these mock-up are EXACT replicas of
our frames dimensions. This is actually how we design and test the shapes
during development: We cut the exact shapes with a laser and strap it onto our
faces (and then have our face marked with black stripes from the
laser burning...). The Collection

7 shapes, all available in a choice of 2 3 colour combinations:     » Silver Stainless frame w/ gradient brown lenses     » Black frame w/ gradient grey lenses     » New 18K GOLD plated Limited Edition available(Check our gallery - right tab on top of the page - to see
larger pics and additional images)
Grey lenses offer the best colour rendering (most neutral) while the brown
lenses will increase the contrasts.  Polarized lenses (optional)Polarized lenses offer an additional protection from light, as they also blocks horizontal rays of light, including those reflected off horizontal surfaces such as water and snow (seen as glare). Non-polarized lenses will filter down these rays but won't block them completely as polarized lenses do.Good for: 

Water activities

Driving (with some exception, see next line below)
Not great for: 
Spotting oil or icy patches on the road (they will be harder to spot as they can usually be seen because of the intense reflection they create) - not recommended for riding motorcycle

Liquid crystal displays (LCD), found on mobile phones and some dashboard instruments, can become invisible at certain angles.
 In the detailsTHE LENSESLenses were the main focus of this project from the start. We wanted to offer the best possible lenses, while maintaining an affordable price. We quickly selected German Optical Powerhouse Zeiss®, reputed for their outstanding lens quality in many fields (camera, telescope, prescription and sunglass). We met several times with them (thanks for your patience Mariele!) and even went in Italy to convince them (thank you Pietro) to let us use their amazing lenses, even if our price point was going to be well under their usual brand requirements.  We like to think they liked our objective of offering their great lenses to a wider audience. LENSES TECHNICAL SPECS     » Producer: Carl Zeiss Vision, Italy     » Material: Polyamid (Nylon-type) w/ gradient tint     » Base 6 curvature     » Filter Category: 2 (suitable for driving use)     » Backside Anti-reflection coating     » Back side and Front side Ri-Pel™ super-hydrophobic coating     » 100% UV-A and UV-B protection     » Optional polarizing filter
«Comfortable» lensesThe quality of lenses goes well beyond the protection from UV rays. Today, most pharmacy sunglasses will offer a good enough protection from UV.  The difference rather lies in the visual comfort and accuracy the lenses will provide. Such qualities come from high optical quality, only obtained with highly rigorous manufacturing processes and best raw materials. High quality lenses result in less optical distortion, and a smoother transmission of light, hence providing a more accurate perception of details and depth, and sort of a «relaxing» effect to the eyes.To ensure a perfect visual comfort in all situation, we decided to add an anti-reflect coating to the back of the lenses, to eliminate disturbing glare that may sometime occur when lights bounce on the lenses from the side or from the back.
Super easy to cleanAs an extra, we also added Zeiss' Ri-Pel™ treatment to all our lenses. This super-hydrophobic treatment «seals» the surface of the lenses, so water beads and roll off (oil and dust slip off the surface as well), making the lenses much easier to clean. The treatment also provide an additional scratch-resistance.THE FRAMEAs we over stated by now (...), we want our first product to be the embodiment of our philosophy of «less is more». So we simply remove all we could to only keep the bare essential. Our frames are made out of a single piece of high-end Japanese stainless steel (this is the same steel used to make high precision chirurgical instruments such as scalpels). Hinges? Screws? Soldering? No need, so we got rid of.Wide unobstructed field-of-viewThe frame curvature offers a wrap-style protection so sunlights won't get in from the sides. On the other hand, our tiny temples keep the sides unobstructed so you can see if something's in your blind spots (especially useful when driving).FRAME TECHNICAL SPECS      » Material: Japanese Stainless Steel (confidential grade...:), allergenic-free           (nickel-free stainless steel)          » Frame weight: 5g (15 g with the lenses)     » IP plating (for colours other then Silver Stainless)     » Medical-grade silicon nose pads     » Wrapped-design (the frame curvature fits tighter to the face)     » Easy adjustable temple tips and nose pads     » No hinge, screws or welding2 Great Polyamid lenses. 1 piece of cutting-edge Japanese stainless steel. A dash of medical-grade silicon. When using top ingredients, no need for a complex recipe. Lifetime Warranty. Yeah you read right.While we claim our frames are so good, it would be ridiculous to only offer a standard warranty, right?Right.And besides, there's only one part to warranty (the frame is a one piece, remember?). So there it is: LIFETIME WARRANTY. You break it, we'll replace it (nominal shipping charges may apply). A simple case
In our opinion, it would be a non-sense to send these
amazing sunglasses in a cheap pouch. So we designed a (you guessed it)
super-simple protective case. A beautiful strip of thick genuine leather simply folded and
minimally sewn. Conveniently flat (when empty), it can also be used for other sunglasses or Rx frames.
 Project DevelopmentA slice of the development process, in images. A lot of work. A lot of fun. About usOur background is Industrial Design. But we consider ourselves, first and foremost, entrepreneurs. We like to try new and different things, innovate. We spent the last 10 years in the eyewear industry, designing for others and for our own collection (www.swapeyewear.com). We want this product to be the first of many. And while we are eyewear specialists, we have several ideas for innovative portable products (check out our upcoming blog  on our upcoming website periodically to learn more on this), always with a focus on quality over quantity.We are based in Montreal. With winter approaching, temperature here is on a steep downhill. Your support will warm our hearts ;). How YOU can help in just a few seconds (and how to get a free pair for yourself...)We have completed the design, validated with multiple samples (thanks John!). We got a deal with Zeiss to get their amazing lenses. We are ready to go.Now we need YOU!!You can do a lot to help our project succeed with just a few seconds of your time...

Its structure (direct to consumer) truly allow us to maximize the value we can deliver to the end-consumers (you), while creating the basis of a sustainable business.This campaign is to serve 3 purposes:» Validate if there is a demand for our frames. Learn more on what you guys like    about it and dislike;» Learn and develop a new way to connect with our consumers. We like to think    about this as «Social Retail»;» Help finance the first production run.Funds will be used to pay for the production of the frames, to buy the lenses and  leather cases and to make the Try-on kits. Oh and a substantial chunk will go on shipping fees (since we included them on all pledges).Note that prices after the campaign will most probably be increased by 20-50$ as we'll have to factor in marketing costs and risk on stock.
Why put your trust in us?In short, we know about eyewear (over 15 years of combined experience), have a solid network of suppliers and we've done it before (launch new products). Our first eyewear product was a color-interchangeable frame called Toulch One we developed with Montreal renowned optometrists Harry and Michael Toulch. It was later bought by a big Italian distributor that re-branded it under their Try Change house brand (they seem to have stop selling it but you can still find plenty of images on Google). Our second project in eyewear is still existing, even though we suffered serious problems with our distributors and had to restructure our whole business. We recently decided to go full online. Check out www.swapeyewear.com Please keep in mind the website is not yet fully completed!What are the risks?We designed and launched 2 collections from scratch. We know there will be hickups. We don't know what yet but we are ready to react promptly. The biggest risk is in the timing. Any delay from one of our supplier may impact the delivery date.We promise we'll be 100% transparent and keep you informed.And we will deliver what is promise on this page.

Fleur de Nuit brings a new revolution in luxury lingerie shopping. </p><p>The experience encompasses
not only the finest lingerie, but a singular focus on bringing acceptance and
excellence to every preference, taste, and body type. Women need not sacrifice
beautiful materials, fit, and the sumptuousness of designer labels to outfit
themselves for the most provocative fantasies. In addition, the shopping
experience is designed to embrace the social experience of couples or groups of
women shopping together, including refreshments and ample seating within the
privacy of dressing rooms. Personal shoppers and a full line of complimenting
accessories contribute to the tailored experience that high-end consumers
demand. All the elements of the offering – products, as well as ambiance, and
customer service, combine to create a sense of importance, acceptance in an

<br/></div>","The Luxury Lingerie shopping experience to spark your creativity,
feed your imagination, and bond with your partner.
Hello! I’m Laura Cuttill owner of Fleur de
Nuit. Thank you for taking time to watch our short video. We hope it’s given
you a little glimpse of our beautiful and daring lingerie line. We're excited
to launch our campaign and make these styles available first to our backers who believe in us and see our vision. *We ask that you share this
project using the links just below our video, we would be forever grateful!*A little about me first and then we welcome you explore our campaign!
As the owner, I had a vision to provide a luxurious
and social lingerie shopping experience for men and women looking to explore
new pleasures and push boundaries through high-quality clothing and accessories
from the BEST designers across the U.S. and Europe. 
I bring to the table history as a seasoned
business owner and operational leader with over 15 years of demonstrated
ability to fuse market needs, business drivers, and financial interests into
streamlined, profitable operations. After starting 2 businesses and sitting on
the board of directors, I am now following my life time dream and passion with
Fleur de Nuit which pulls together my entrepreneurial spirit, charisma, people
skills and my analytical and creative problem-solving bents to make this new
business highly successful.
Now that we have beautiful lines, what's next?Upon returning on a trip from Europe I realized that women in the U.S. lacked choices when it came to having both LUXURY along with SEXY and DARING styles. The shopping experience inspired me to bring these same choices to women in the U.S. So I shopped, met with, and researched designers who specialize in combining high end, in-house, or hand made pieces with the look I wanted and women need....dramatically Sexy styles!So we begin by opening a retail boutique in the
beautiful Hill Country in Austin, TX. It is in this retail environment that
Fleur de Nuit brings a new revolution in luxury lingerie shopping. The experience encompasses
not only the finest lingerie, but a singular focus on bringing acceptance and
excellence to every preference, taste, and body type. Women need not sacrifice
beautiful materials, fit, and the sumptuousness of designer labels to outfit
themselves for the most provocative fantasies. In addition, the shopping
experience is designed to embrace the social experience of couples or groups of
women shopping together, including refreshments and ample seating within the
privacy of dressing rooms. Personal shoppers and a full line of complimenting
accessories contribute to the tailored experience that high-end consumers
demand. All the elements of the offering – products, as well as ambiance, and
customer service, combine to create a sense of importance, acceptance in an
elite group, and fun for those shopping. And we are excited to announce that
early next year we will launch our ONLINE STORE for worldwide shopping.We have set ourselves apart by choosing only pieces
that are sewn or hand finished with exquisite details such as French seams,
hand beading and hand embroidery. Our carefully selected inventory is very
innovative, a masterpiece that tells a story, and chosen to create moments of pleasure.
We offer carefully selected pieces starting
with the more adventuresses, sophisticated and provocative line with an
alternative point of view. Dramatically sensuous and spicy comes to mind when
viewing these items. It is definitely unforgettable. We also offer the more feminine approach which
brings to mind playful promises. We have exceptional pieces to choose from that is too rare to resist! Expect to see Sexy-Chic lingerie sets and pieces.
What each pledge helps us do

The reason we’ve decided to take on this
campaign is not only to gain the funds necessary to establish Fleur de Nuit,
but to also spread the word about who we are, what Fleur de Nuit represents, and
to offer women a unique option of luxury lingerie with styles ranging from soft
and flirty to strong and daring. Fleur de Nuit takes a huge step away from
typical styles offered at most department stores by offering beautiful handmade
and sewn in house by top U.S. and European designers.Our goal is to make this available first here in Austin, TX, then across the country and worldwide with our online shopping experience. Now that you have just  flavor of what we will offer, you probably want to know what delicious incentives we offer in return for your generous contributions.  We have several offerings just for you.All of the items on the right are carefully selected from our lovely designs at various price points for every budget.  Simply select the item you'd like and once your contribution is made, we will send you a survey form to collect information on your sizing and color preferences.  $5 A BIG Thank YOU! Receive a personalized digital thank you from the bottom of my heart.

Stockings: Stylish and quintessential, these girogia fishnet thigh-highs
give a poised Italian twist to traditional fishnet stockings. The subtle
micro-fishnet pattern cleverly allow glimpses of bare skin; they add a racy
touch to both business and evening wear. The feminine fishnet carries from a
slim shiny lace band right down to the toe.  Stockings come in a beautiful
slide-out box, perfect for gifting and storing these treasures.

Robe: A simple, sexy memento, these robes are made with a polyblend. The
FDN logo is embroidered on the right side.  They were first sourced as
uniforms for our models to wear over bra and panty sets while serving as
hostesses at our events. However, the reaction to them was so overwhelmingly
positive that we kept them around as an entry point to some of our finer
lingerie. This crowd-funding campaign is your opportunity to get your limited
run of these, as we will not be selling them in the store! For larger and more images: http://fleurdenuitaustin.com/?page_id=578$100 Geisha

Whilst browsing social media in search of “nude” clothes and accessories, I noticed that the term always drew the same results. Although I was in search of items that matched my dark skin tone, all I kept coming across were the same beige and  tan shades.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Introducing to some, reconnecting to others, and reaching out to YOU...I am Charles Fitzpatrick:</p>
<p>Formally trained as an engineer, lawyer, and business owner/manager by the finest institutions in the land, including The School of Life and Hard Knocks</p>
<p>Small Business Strategist</p>

<p>COCK AND OWL was born in my mind and has been articulated through design by my nephew Michael Thomas. The premise is simple: First one woke (i.e. The Cock), Last one sleep(i.e. The Owl). It is the brand for those who hustle, those who do what it takes, those who put in the long hours to make sure that dreams become reality when the sun comes up and until it goes down.</p>
<p>COCK AND OWL will begin with t-shirts and progressively move into expanding its fashion line to include diverse wear for the people that find themselves waking up early and going to bed late and need clothes to reflect their versatility and their ability to slip in and out of any environment. We are classic and timeless. </p>
<p>In this campaign, we are seeking to raise funding for some of our overhead costs in replacing laptop equipment for our creative director(Michael Thomas), to upgrade our design software, and purchase our exclusive inaugural t-shirts.</p>
<p>In investing in our campaign, you get two wins:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have the internal satisfaction of having supported someone near and dear to you, or someone who is close to someone near and dear to you.</li>
<li>You get the first shirt which is only being made in limited quantity and it is sure to fetch you a bunch of stares and inquiries...and some monetary appreciation when the line takes off!</li>
</ul>
<p>We are readying to launch our website and store when this campaign ends, so you can help us with this last step!</p>

Do you want to see some of the rarest laminated metals on the planet? Would you like to relax by circling two smooth spheres in the palm of your hand? Here’s your chance!Introducing the BilletSPIN Sphere collectionEach Sphere is .98"" in diameter and comes with its own stand made of brass.Perfectly sized for any desk, these won’t take over your workspace but are still large enough for the detail to shine.Every Sphere and stand is proudly machined with care in our shop in America’s heartland.Choose from 15 materials: 8 standard metals, 6 layered exotics, and a superconductor.Whatever you choose, BilletSPIN Spheres gleam with simple elegance that's sure to draw attention.Stretch Goal Reached!I thought I had more time but due to the amazing support I will release this new option now: The Zirconium Sphere!! Machined, polished and flamed dark gray/black. Weighing in at 55grams. Here is your chance to own this element. This sphere is NOT included in the whole enchilada. StandardsVaried finishes highlight the natural beauty of the material while giving each metal a distinct look. From magnesium, the lightest option, to tungsten, the heaviest, the materials also vary widely in weight. Take a look at the differences!ExoticsThe 6 layered exotic Spheres are made of mokume, Damascus and Timascus. The superconductor, also an exotic, is copper with niobium rods. We'll get into more detail below, but in short, these highly sought-after materials are time-consuming, expensive, and extremely difficult to make. Once we receive these materials from our suppliers, we machine them into the round shape, accenting the beauty of each unique combination.  Get to know the exoticsTimascus- Consists of two or more titanium alloys laminated and patterned resembling steel Damascus. The various alloys color differently through the use of heat or anodizing. Each type of titanium alloy has the potential for a new color combination.Damascus- Two different grades of stainless steel that are forged together to make specific patterns. Once machined and polished, we acid etch these to bring out the breathtaking pattern hidden in the materials.Mokume- Decorative metal that is made by fusing different non-ferrous metals together through heat and pressure. Our 2-color mokume uses nickel silver and copper layers, while the 3-color uses nickel silver, copper, and brass.Superconductor- Superconductors are materials that conduct electricity without electrical resistance, which dissipates the charge. Our superconductor Sphere is made from copper and has 444 rods of niobium running through it. In depth video of all 15 variations:About UsMy name is Rich Stadler. I've been a machinist for over 25 years, and for me, there is nothing better than finding what is hiding in a raw bar of material. My passion for creating functional art with metal drove me to start BilletSPIN in March, 2015. This year, it became my full-time job.

</div></div>","About Figments & Filaments II: Figments & Filaments is a convention celebrating costuming and cosplay in all of its various genres and applications. Whether researching the clothing of a by-gone era, designing costume or make up for stage or screen or the whim of an individual, what one wears can say volumes of not only the times and society that a person identifies with, but also what that person says about themselves and their society. Like a Fun House mirror, our clothes and costumes at once distort and reveal a deeper reality about ourselves. Figments & Filaments II will be held April 24 - 26, 2015 at the DoubleTree Hilton in Overland Park, KS.Our Guests of Honor for 2015 include:

Professor Gale Owen-Crocker, professor of Anglo-Saxon Culture at The University of Manchester, UK and Director of the Manchester Centre for Anglo-Saxon Studies.  She has a new book coming out and Figments & Filaments will be its United States debut!
Matthew Gnagy, author, designer, costume historian, and professional knitter.
Robin Netherton, author and editor of historic costuming books, and costume researcher
Jillian Venters, author of Gothic Charm School, and the blog of the same name.
Each of the specialists mentioned above holds a valuable piece of the puzzle for many costumers. The historian knows what is right & accurate for a given period. The theatrical designer knows how a costume needs to be presented in a given work, and how to layer that costume with meaning. The living historian knows what it means to live in a particular outfit. We are endeavoring to bring all those pieces in one place, to the benefit to a wider costuming audience.

We want to reach out to colleges and universities locally and around the country and forge relationships with their fashion design and theater departments. If we get enough participation from these groups, we hope to have an intercollegiate costume contest.
We plan to expand the Costume Gallery and add a Masked Ball after the Fashion Show. We plan to continue activities from last year that people enjoyed such as the Scrap Swap and the Silent Auction.



  Risks & Challenges  Figments & Filaments 1 was a great success! We are moving to a larger and better-equipped hotel, which requires more of a financial outlay.  
As with any convention, there is a risk that a Guest of Honor may get ill and may not be able to attend. We have ideas for Guests to invite if this happens.
The larger hotel has larger costs associated with it. We have budgeted for this and are running this campaign to cover these costs.
Some of the perks may be mailed after the convention rather than before.

  

Want to help more?


We love volunteers! Come to the convention and work a couple hours. You'll have our eternal gratitude and get a patch for helping out.


Teach a class! We need more teachers and welcome a larger variety of classes. Teachers also get into the Friday Evening Guest of Honor Meet & Greet.


Display your work in the Gallery! Have you made a gorgeous outfit that you don't want to wear all day? Display it in our gallery while you attend classes.


Host a room party! There will be a prize for the best themed room party.

<p><b>Short
Summary</b></p>
<p>Hello! My name is Van
Nguyen. I'm currently finishing up my Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Fashion
Design at the Art Institute of Seattle, and plan to graduate in December. In
order to graduate, however, each Fashion Design major must design and construct
a portfolio installation for the mandatory Portfolio Show this December. A
portfolio installation consists of <b>original garments</b>, <b>take
away catalog</b>, <b>portfolio set</b>, and <b>a</b> <b>visually displayed space</b>.</p>
<p><b>Each student pays for their materials and
supplies out of pocket for every single element. </b>Depending
on the materials chosen, a single standard portfolio book cost around $117 to
$200, even more for higher quality book and paper quality. One of the most
common issues with design students is not having the funds to completely bring
our vision to life, to take our creativity above and beyond. To pay for my
assignments, along with my parent’s help, I currently work two part-time jobs
on top of being a full-time student. I've been fortunate enough to be able to
pay for part of my tuition, rent, materials and supplies for my senior
collection, food, bus fare, and discretionary activities, but it's not
enough. </p>
<p>To graduate as a
fashion designer with a strong portfolio has been my goal since elementary school.
Aside from previous years' collections, I have designed and constructed a senior collection of 8 looks total. I was
honored to receive Best Runway Look and Designer of the Year awards with the
collection from The Art Institute of Seattle’s annual fashion show in March
2014. I am very, very happy and proud to see the work I have achieved so far.
It would mean the world to me if I am able continue the work quality that I
have been maintaining through out my career.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/980471/files/20141102154831-Van_s_Awards.jpg_.jpg?1414972111"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/980518/files/20141102160858-Van-runway-looks.jpg?1414973338"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b>Where
will the Money Go</b></p>
<p>My goal is to gather $800 in 25 days. Most of the
money I receive will be spent first on getting my portfolio together (portfolio
binder, paper, business card, printing). Then the rest will go into getting
display props for my booth on the day of portfolio in December. If I exceed my
initial goal, the money will go back and helps pay for take away gifts, fashion
booklets, and perks. Below is a more detailed list of where the donated money
will go:</p>

<p><b>The

<p>EMBARK is a collection
I designed to honor women of the modern era, who possess a bold personality and
an ambition to explore. There is a growing number of young and fearless women
who are slowly changing the world, and I would like to embrace and dedicate to
this crowd. EMBARK is a mix of bold prints, vibrant color, playful cut, as well
as fluid and feminine silhouette. The collection portrayed the diverse beauty
of the women who inspired it, and set them free, free to be anything.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Risks

<p>The biggest risk that I might run into is to not be
able to raise $800 in 25 days. Within these 25 days, I would have to order my
portfolio books, business cards, and staging props so that they could be ready
for Portfolio Show at the beginning of December. If I don’t meet my target by November
26<sup>th</sup>, all the funds donated will still be spent on the production of
portfolio, as well as sending all the gifts and perks out between mid-December

</div><p>Behind every great story there are multiple, often small,

<h3>How do we support Athletes?</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>There are multiple ways in which we are trying to make an
impact. These are in the following domains:</p>
<p><b><span>1.<span>  </span></span></b><b>Funding – </b>We provide a crowdfunding platform
to the athletes which can help them raise funds to sponsor their preparation. With the raised funds, they get access to better facilities, equipment, technology, nutritionists, doctors, trainers, etc. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">You
can view some of the athlete campaigns on our platform <a href=""https://www.indiaforsports.com/campaign"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.indiaforsports.com/campaign"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>here</b></a>.</span> </p>
<p><b><span>2.<span>  </span></span></b><b>Visibility – </b>Athletes in India never
enjoy the visibility they deserve. We have decided to change that. We are giving extensive media coverage to many deserving athletes. As a result, they are now being approached by various Magazines, Blogs and other
forms of media as well.</p>
<p><b><span>3.<span>  </span></span></b><b>Conducting Mental Conditioning and Psychology
sessions – </b>During a big event, it’s all about how an athlete can handle the
pressure and stay calm to produce their best performance. ‘India For Sports’
has tied up with companies which specialize in conducting mental
conditioning sessions, diet consultancy sessions and performance enhancement
sessions for athletes. The impact of this was visible when one of our athletes
won the bronze medal at the Incheon Asian Games 2014. </p>
<p><b><span>4.<span>  '</span></span></b><b>Sportify India' – </b>We believe in thinking
for the long term. The only way to do that is to create a self sustaining
engine for sports, which can only happen if we decide to change the mindset of
the people. We strive to do this on a regular basis through our social media
posts. Our <b><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/IndiaForSports"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a></b> and <b><a href=""https://twitter.com/indiaforsports"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Twitter</a></b>
pages are garnering widespread popularity.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Why should you support this Project? <br/>
</h3>
<p><b>From zero support to
currently more than 4200 people behind us</b>, we have come a long way in such
a short span of time. <b>We don’t take any
revenue cuts from the money we raise for our athletes</b> as we believe that
every penny is important to make a difference in the lives of probably the most
deserving athletes in India. That is why we look for alternate ways of running our platform.<br/></p>
<p>We have the stories of these athletes on our <b><a href=""https://www.indiaforsports.com/athlete"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a></b>. They are facing
problems ranging from <b>lack of basic
spikes to lack of good coaches and equipment</b>. There is an athlete whose
family had to sell their family shop and land so that their talented
son could pursue shot put. Another athlete’s mother had no option but to pawn her gold
ornaments and sell the family car to buy her archer son a modern bow. </p>
<p>Through our small step, we are trying to create a positive
feedback loop, the effect of which will be huge in time to come. </p>

his friends as ‘Rocky Balboa’ for his attitude and strength, in his campaign
video <b><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSo7uG-A-wo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a></b>. </p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Why should you contribute to the athletes from a different country if you are not an Indian?<br/>
</h3>
<p>This might be the first question that would cross my mind after
reading this if I weren't an Indian. </p>
<p>Fair enough. </p>
<p>We at IFS believe that talented athletes, irrespective of
the country they belong to, should be given <b>a fair chance to represent their
country</b> at international sports events. There are many talented athletes who
struggle to even get to these events, mostly due to due to <b>lack of proper
sports gear, lack of training and infrastructure and lack of funds to arrange a
ticket for international travel</b>. Don’t you
think if an athlete is talented and has to potential to alter a world record,
he/she deserves a chance?</p>
<p>And even after knowing that some of these athletes would
probably be competing against athletes from your country and still contributing
for their cause to give them an equal chance of a competition is something that
only a true champion can do. And more than being a champion you showcase that
there are no limits to humanity as looking beyond borders is what humanity
teaches us most. We cannot thank you enough for creating such a big impact in
somebody’s life. </p>
<br/><h3><b>Why do we not ask for
funds directly for the athlete, instead of a platform which in turn raises
funds for them?</b></h3>
<p><b>“Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a
man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime”</b></p>
<p>Since a one-time support will only help a few athletes and
will not solve the deep rooted problem permanently, we wish to think ‘Big’ and
have already created a crowdfunding platform where we identify poor
athletes who have huge potential of garnering great success. If our platform gets sufficient funds, it will do wonders for hundreds of athletes.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b><br/></b></h3>
<b>
<h3>How will the funds be
utilized?</h3></b><p></p>
<p>We intend to raise an amount of $12,000 through Indiegogo.com, which is 40% of the total amount we need for our fixed costs and to operate for at least a year - $30.000. We have
bootstrapped and have already put in the first 30% of the amount, $9,000
so that we could launch the platform. We would
be raising the rest of the amount through other means. </p>
<p>Now that we are getting some good support for our athletes
after our launch, we plan to scale big and reach out to as many athletes as
possible for which we need your support.</p>
<p>A huge portion of the raised money will go towards the
website development, deployment, onsite presence, offsite promotions, etc. The
funds being raised will be utilized for the first year. A break-up of these
costs is given below:</p>
<p>Offsite promotions – $5,000</p>
<p>Web promotions – $3,000<br/></p>
<p>Athlete On-boarding – $1,000 </p>
<p>Website maintenance – $1,000</p>
<p>Website content development – $2,000</p>
<p>Total target through Indiegogo – $12,000</p>

<p>There are

<p>We
understand that not everyone can make an help monetarily. But there are other ways of creating the same impact. Studies show that 'People listen to People' and if you spread the word out through social media; Facebook,
Twitter, Linkedin and word of Mouth, we would be indebted forever. We will be happy to
reciprocate by endorsing your brand or corporation during our journey through
the social media sites. </p>

monetary support for our deserving athletes while there have been many who have
wrote to us that they want to support us by being a part of our team. Imagine
the inspiration and drive that we get when we receive these e-mails!
Arohi
Deshpande from Mumbai wrote to us, “I have been a practitioner of Badminton and
Running since the age of 13 and have worked closely with some poor but highly
talented athletes. Hence, understanding of the grave issue, passion for sports
and the dream of clinching medals at the highest level is what brings me to ‘India
For Sports.’” 
Arohi now
works with IFS as a Sports Evangelist and doesn't draw a paycheck. In fact, none of us do! This initiative is the result of our passion for sports and desire to bring true change.

Keeping you informed.

We know that for a contributor the most important aspect for their contribution is the impact it creates in the society. 
We will keep you updated with not only how we are creating an impact by the funds contributed by you, but also how, these contributions are making a difference in the lives of poor athletes in India. 


Other ways you can help.

There are
multiple ways you can be a part of this initiative. Please tell your friends
and family if you think what we are doing is worth sharing with them. 
We
understand that not everyone can make an help monetarily. But there are other ways of creating the same impact. Studies show that 'People listen to People' and if you spread the word out through social media; Facebook,
Twitter, Linkedin and word of Mouth, we would be indebted forever. We will be happy to
reciprocate by endorsing your brand or corporation during our journey through
the social media sites. 
We
greatly appreciate your support and contributions. We literally could not do this
without your help. 
We would love
to receive any form of communication from you. Please write to us at

The working title was, ""You're Not Too Far Behind Me, Kid"", but I have decided that ""Sixty over 60: A Wise Portrait Collection"", had a unique ring to it.  I have spent more than the the past year, traveling around both Illinois, Wisconsin, and even across the country, to do something that I felt was important. I sat with beautiful and wonderful people, all over 60 years of age, all very different, and asked them - ""After what you know today, what advice would you have given to the person in that picture?"" That picture, being a photo of their younger selves. The goal of this book, was advice for the rest of us, and the final result is an amazing group of people from all different walks of life, professions, and backgrounds, giving heartfelt, sometimes serious and sometimes fun advice to the rest of us. The foreword for my newest project, is written by the amazing Dr. Elizabeth Lombardo, a renowned author, and Shaquille O'Neal's personal life coach. I met this wonderful lady at an event last winter, and she was kind enough to write this foreword for my newest endeavor. </p>
<p>The purpose of this campaign, is for pre-orders of this newest project. Being a self-published author, print costs can be quite high for print on demand books through services such as Blurb.com, or Amazon.com. This campaign will allow me to print the books in bulk at volume discounts. The goal is to pre-order at least 100 books, for a 20% discount. The books will be softcover, full cover, and about 8x10 inches when completed. The more we can pre-order, the more I will be able to distribute to bookstores, and sell beyond the pre-orders here on IndieGoGo. The book will also be avaliable through the Apple store for I-Pad, and I am working on copies for Kindle as well, once the print copies are completed.</p>
<p>As a participant, you will be receiving an autographed copy of the book, as well as personalized thank you note from me. Please check out all of the perks for different donation amounts. My goal of a second book is very near, as I work on a third project and the beginning phases of a fourth. I hope to keep creating these projects, and human interest pieces, to show a connection between all of us, and our human condition.  Your donation, will be helping another part of my dreams come true. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Please share this link and campaign with your loved ones and anyone you think may want a copy of the first printing of this project, I truly appreciate your support always!</h3>

better.  We are asking you to join and help us.  By taking this
approach, I believe we can be even more profitable over the long term.</p>
<p>How does a dentist get into the business of making handbags you might
ask?  I wanted to leverage my potential in a way that could help more
people. After much thought and consideration, I realized that one of the most
powerful forces for improving the lives of people was business, especially
business done in a way that nurtures people and the planet.  So I made a
pivot to follow my passion and make a difference.  I’ve always dreamed of
returning to my hometown and working to improve our local economy by creating
manufacturing jobs that will pay a decent wage.  The handbags were a
perfect fit since I love fashion, and especially these beautiful bags.  </p><p>                      <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444183888/svbmzoitaafozkf1yz9j.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p><b>Our Goal:</b> $10,000</p>
<p>We have 300 handbags shipping from our suppliers. These are
non-customized off the shelf bags we are offering as our perks.  These
bags represent what we will be creating locally by importing just the outer
rattan bodies to be built into the bags our customers design on line. The
beauty of rattan is that it grows wild in the rain-forest and by highlighting
its use we can help conserve the forests where it grows.  </p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444184211/de5ehq6j4xftu2ppvqlo.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>The money from this campaign will help us to</strong> </p>
<p>1. Add custom design to our website.  We need a special type of
software (configurator) that will make it possible for you, the customer, to
create the style of bag you want.</p>
<p>2. Build inventory of necessary supply parts i.e. leather,
fabric, hardware, rattan etc. to be used in the local manufacturing
process. </p>
<p>3.  Purchase more pre-made bags for sale as we build manufacturing
ability. </p>
<p><b>What you get:</b>  Beautiful and unique bag(s) handmade in Java by
traditional artists.  We are offering three styles to select from. 
Each bag features rattan woven with skill and care into beautiful designs that
are surprisingly strong.</p><p><br/></p><p>                            <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444184939/nrhafs81ac1v3af2o7xw.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>                               </p><p></p><p>                               <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447034979/ia59jjgoo92mogfrbp12.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p>                                 <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447035683/sfpcueasrblx8rbylgbj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>             </p><p>                <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447036650/yoxdc3tf5h6isupjk7mp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p>                                 <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447040749/cwurbubedpfwnib8gthj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p>                             <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445133355/ne81jhma3qtnuakvsyyc.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 406.91px;

<p><b>Risks and Challenges</b></p>
<p>Manufacturing Costs:  We currently are working with local government
and private agencies that specialize in manufacturing to discover lean
manufacturing methods and invent new designs that will make the process less
expensive and more efficient.</p>
<p>Rain forest loss:  As most of us know we are losing more and more
natural rain forest.  This is where rattan grows wild so we will work with
agencies such as the Rainforest Alliance to help conserve what is left.</p>

<p>Thank you everyone for your support and especially your contributions. 
I am grateful for the huge amount of support we have received locally in Butte,
America including Blackstone Launch Pad, Small Business Development Center, Headwaters
RC and D, Manufacturing Consortium of Montana and the Montana Manufacturing
Extension.  We also have over 60 women who have volunteered to test and
review our bags to help make them better.  In Java we must thank Endro and
his wife Verri of  Gendhis who have graciously helped me understand 
rattan,  and increased my appreciation for this natural beautiful resource. T</p>

</div></div>","We are currently shipping our handbags nation-wide.  If you would like to purchase a bag visit www.purseforthepeople.com.  Thanks to all our incredible supporters for a fantastic launch on Indiegogo. Blessings!Carole  Hello, I'm Carole Murphy, the founder of Purse for the People. Though originally a dentist by training, my new passion is to:
1.  Create an online business that allows customers to design their own handbag.  Make our products in the USA with attention to quality and make them with materials that are good for the planet.  
2.  Make
sure that customers, the environment and all our partners win in the
process of doing business.  I invested the last three years of my life
preparing for the launch of Purse for the People -- studying, researching,
building relationships and charting a course with the help of many
others. 
                                                                                       



                                             Our campaign is really part of a movement to do business
better.  We are asking you to join and help us.  By taking this
approach, I believe we can be even more profitable over the long term.
How does a dentist get into the business of making handbags you might
ask?  I wanted to leverage my potential in a way that could help more
people. After much thought and consideration, I realized that one of the most
powerful forces for improving the lives of people was business, especially
business done in a way that nurtures people and the planet.  So I made a
pivot to follow my passion and make a difference.  I’ve always dreamed of
returning to my hometown and working to improve our local economy by creating
manufacturing jobs that will pay a decent wage.  The handbags were a
perfect fit since I love fashion, and especially these beautiful bags.                        

What We Need & What You Get
Our Goal: $10,000
We have 300 handbags shipping from our suppliers. These are
non-customized off the shelf bags we are offering as our perks.  These
bags represent what we will be creating locally by importing just the outer
rattan bodies to be built into the bags our customers design on line. The
beauty of rattan is that it grows wild in the rain-forest and by highlighting
its use we can help conserve the forests where it grows.  
The money from this campaign will help us to 
1. Add custom design to our website.  We need a special type of
software (configurator) that will make it possible for you, the customer, to
create the style of bag you want.
2. Build inventory of necessary supply parts i.e. leather,
fabric, hardware, rattan etc. to be used in the local manufacturing
process. 
3.  Purchase more pre-made bags for sale as we build manufacturing
ability. 
What you get:  Beautiful and unique bag(s) handmade in Java by
traditional artists.  We are offering three styles to select from. 
Each bag features rattan woven with skill and care into beautiful designs that
are surprisingly strong.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
The Impact

Local: Bringing back made in the USA =
Jobs and Pride in Quality!




                                          

Global:  We are supporting the peoples of Borneo and Java, helping them to keep their
ancient traditions alive.  We are also helping to preserve the rain forest
because that is where the rattan grows wild. (No rain forest=No rattan)  


  






                                       

   
              


Risks and Challenges
Manufacturing Costs:  We currently are working with local government
and private agencies that specialize in manufacturing to discover lean
manufacturing methods and invent new designs that will make the process less
expensive and more efficient.
Rain forest loss:  As most of us know we are losing more and more
natural rain forest.  This is where rattan grows wild so we will work with
agencies such as the Rainforest Alliance to help conserve what is left.


                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Another Way You Can Help
You can be a huge part of this campaign by spreading the word.  This

<div><span style=""font-size: 36px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 1px;line-height: 40px;background-color: initial;"">THE STORY</span></div>
<h3><b>How the metabolic hack works</b></h3>
<p>Did you know you can trick your body into thinking it’s in a colder environment than it actually is by stimulating specific regions with cold temperatures? This creates a cascade of physiological responses in your body that kick your metabolism into overdrive, As a result, you burn unwanted fat and get leaner, all while letting your body do the work for you! </p>
<p>Based on estimates derived from our prototypes, competitors and scientific literature we estimate that <b>you'll be able to burn between 500 and 1000 calories a day</b>, just by wearing our clothing for the recommended duration. <b>That's 1 to 2 pounds a week!</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435016296/an2ikjyz0q2pesrriaub.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p> <h3><b>Wait, won’t I feel cold?</b></h3>
<p>Don’t worry, this stimulation is so mild you’ll forget all about it after just a few seconds of adaptation. The same concept is at play every time you wade into a pool. <b>You feel cold for a few seconds and then the sensation vanishes.</b> The pool doesn’t warm up, it’s your body that starts to burn from within to counteract its new environment. </p>
<p>Besides, if you do feel the chill you can always <b>adjust the temperature of your Thin Ice clothing via smartphone</b> to accommodate your comfort level. At Thin Ice, we want to have a long-term weight-management relationship with you. It's not in our best interest to scare you away by making you uncomfortably cold!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><b>How Does Thin Ice Clothing Harness the Metabolism Hack? </b></h3>
<p>The Thin Ice insole and vest target regions of your body with<b> high concentrations of thermoreceptors</b>. These neural receptors alert your body to the presence of cold, triggering a metabolic response that generates heat in your core. </p>
<p>As the core’s blood warms, it then must be pumped all the way to the extremities. The best part of this process is that your body does all this calorie-expensive work automatically<b> without you even having to think about it. </b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435016380/te1ca1ze0ivjsf2wq3ky.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>What's the Science Behind Thin Ice!?</h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The bodily pathway responsible for this heat generation is called the <b>Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT)</b> <b>pathway. </b>This pathway basically functions as your body’s internal thermostat. Even in room temperature, <b>roughly 50% of your daily calories are burnt for no other reason than to keep your body at a comfortable temperature.</b> </span></p>
<p>Notice that you <b>undergo NO shivering</b> at room temperature. This is because the BAT pathway is completely different than the shivering mechanism. Thin Ice stimulates BAT and will <b><i>not</i> </b>make you shiver. This allows Thin Ice’s patent-pending weight-loss technology to help you burn excess calories while being hidden discretely in clothing and apparel items.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Show Me the Research!</h3>
<p>Thin Ice products might sound too good to be true, but we are proud to say that their underlying concept is based on decades of rigorous <b>peer-reviewed scientific research.</b></p>

<h3>The Science at Work</h3>
<p>Besides the scientific articles on the subject matter there are also a tonne of anecdotal examples of the same temperature-related weight-loss effects at play. One of the most salient examples is that of Michael Phelps' diet as he trained for the Beijing Olympics. During that time<b> he ate the 12,000 calories</b> seen below on a daily basis:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436416111/mqb9zjbj60amlvhrydrk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Phelps was able to eat all of that (6 times more than the average person) while staying ripped</b>. Only about half this calorie intake is explainable by his exercise regime and basal metabolic rate. The thousands of missing calories are accounted for by considering Phelps trained in a pool as opposed to land for 4 hours a day. </p>
<p><b>Water is 14 times more thermally conductive than air is</b>. This means heat was leaving Phelps' body much faster than it would have if he was on land leading to massive calorie burning to create heat to keep him warm. This is the exact same process that is at play with Thin Ice products, albeit without the sogginess!</p>
<p><b>BAT also helps to explain why: </b>People scaling Mt. Everest need to pound back sticks of butter not to die of starvation and why people living in climates with more pronounced seasons (including cold ones) tend to have a slightly easier time keeping off weight.</p>
<p>This weight-loss method has been hiding in plain sight throughout our struggles and failed weight-loss attempts. Don't let it sneak away again! <b>Pre-order Thin Ice now!</b></p>
<p>If you are keen to embrace your inner nerd, there is more science we are happy to share with you. Check out the FAQ, and, if you don’t find the information you’re looking for, just ask us!</p>
<div> </div> <h3><b>Hold on, can’t I just turn down my thermostat?</b></h3>
<p>You can! In fact, <b>many doctors recommend that you should add this to your weight-loss regimes</b>. <b>However,</b> you can’t bring a cold room with you everywhere you go, nor would you want to as cold rooms can cause us to shiver. Imagine how popular you’d be at the water cooler if you tried to keep the office shiver-worthy!</p>
<p>The brilliant part of the Thin Ice system is that the entire foot/torso doesn’t need to be kept cold, but only strategically chosen areas targeted by the cooling surface. <b>This targeting means less discomfort while maintaining substantial metabolic response.</b></p>
<p>Best of all, the cooling you experience is totally adjustable to suit your comfort levels through your smart device. This effect will also persist for as long as you want - at the times you want - anywhere you go. So, yes you can turn down your thermostat but remember<b> there’s no need to shiver at home to lose weight.</b> Thin Ice has your back (and feet).</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><b>What comprises Thin Ice Technology?</b></h3>
<p>Thin Ice technology uses specialized Peltier cooling chips to chill specific areas of the body. Peltier chips are also found in other technologies with compact cooling requirements such as microprocessors and various electronics.<b> They essentially act as heat pumps, forcing heat to one side and leaving the other side cool. </b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435016426/jdyc5u1jhdakph6qzywe.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>These chips are powered by an unobtrusive, rechargable battery. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The warmed sides of the Peltier chips are located on the bottom of the insole. The warmth generated by the Peltier mechanism<b> can be dissipated through a variety of heat sink materials. </b></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">There are also technologies that are able to capture heat and convert heat into electricity that are currently being explored by our engineering team. The Thin Ice engineering team is currently hard at work making sure the best possible heat dissipation/capturing mechanisms are combined in the final prototype for maximal comfort and battery efficiency. Hey, that reminds me, meet our engineering team!</span></p>

<p>Thin Ice also worked with a student engineering team from <b>George Brown College</b> on a contract dedicated specifically to exploring mechanism to increase battery life through connect mechanisms and for dissipating the warmth produced by the base of the Peltier chips.</p>
<p>Finally, Thin Ice has project in the works at York University in Toronto through their <b>Innovation York program including 2 engineering specialist professors</b>. The project is in the final stages of its review process. These professors would be exploring the optimal materials to maximize the effectiveness of Thin Ice products.</p>

<h3><b>The Thin Ice Story</b></h3>
<p>Thin Ice was created by <b>personal trainer, former NCAA Athlete, University of Toronto Alumni in Neuroscience and Psychology, Adam Paulin</b>, who is passionate about fitness and human performance. Here is his description of his journey:</p>
<p>“I’ve spent a lot of time asking myself how we can hack our bodies into optimal performance using science. There is a certain satisfaction in making your body do your bidding"".</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435016858/ujo5ijadwtt7ynpnj36j.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Tim Ferris's revolutionary book, <b>the 4-Hour Body </b>- which everyone should <a href=""http://fourhourbody.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">check out</a> - he talks extensively about cold temperatures and their weight-loss effects. I wondered why no one had harnessed this method in product form. There had to be a way to make using cold temperatures for weight-loss more convenient <b>without having to suffer through 20 minutes of hell in an ice bath.</b></p>
<p>What stood out the most in the book was Tim’s comparison of the effects of ice baths versus stimulation using ice packs. What Tim demonstrated is that simply <b>wearing an ice pack on certain parts of the neck you could expect to see 60% of the weight-loss effects as a 20 minute (torture-worthy) ice bath</b>.

<h4>
<b>Where do we ship?</b> </h4>
<p>Shipping is available WORLDWIDE and is automatically calculated based on the country you select in the purchasing process. Shipping to Canada and US is 10 USD and shipping internationally is 49 USD.</p>
<h4><b>When should I ideally use the Thin Ice Vest? </b></h4>
<p>The vest is light and comfortable enough to be slept in and versatile enough to wear under common clothing. It is sleeveless so you can wear it with a variety of outfits. The vest can also be worn safely to bed where you can burn significant calories while you are fast asleep. </p>
<h4><b>When should I ideally use the Thin Ice Insole? </b></h4>
<p>The insole is most effective when walking, sitting, commuting, working at a desk, lounging and generally going about your day. The insole can be worn in almost all footwear, including open toe shoes so you can even be burning fat during a night on the town.</p>
<h4><b>What is the warranty?</b></h4>
<p>We offer a 1 year warranty on the mechanical parts. The layer of the product that touches the skin is replaceable however, so you can buy those parts to keep the vest or insole looking and feeling (and smelling) like new. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><b>Technical FAQ</b></h3>
<h4><b>How do I charge the insole/vest? </b></h4>
<p>The insole and vest will be fully rechargeable using a charging pad which will be included with the product.  </p>
<h4><b>Does it work with iOS and Android Devices?  </b></h4>
<p>Yes, the app will be available for iOS and Android.</p>
<h4>
<b>How long does the battery last</b><b>?  </b>
</h4>
<p>Around 4-8 hours for the insole, 6-8 for the vest. This may change depending on how much juice we can squeeze out of the kinetic mechanism. Remember, the more you walk the longer the insole battery will last. Walking more never hurt anybody in the weight-loss department either :)</p>
<h4>
<b>How long does the battery take to charge</b><b>?  </b>
</h4>
<p>Around two hours from a fully discharged state.</p>
<h4><b>What temperature range does it work with?</b></h4>
<p>The temperature ranges from very mild to relatively intense. We are still streamlining the exact, optimal range to have you losing the most fat with the most possible comfort.</p>
<h4><b>How safe is the insole for weight bearing?</b></h4>
<p>You can safely wear the insole during low intensity activities like walking, lounging, commuting, working at your desk and doing everyday things. We recommend avoiding weight bearing exercises such as weight lifting, running, or any high impact sports. The vest is a good alternative for weight bearing activities that put pressure on the feet such as jogging.</p>
<h4><b>What is the recommended length of use for the insole/vest?</b></h4>
<p>As long as you feel comfortable with. If you experience any discomfort adjust settings using your smart device.  </p>
<h4><b>How do you wash the product?</b></h4>
<p>For everyday cleaning it is recommended to use an antibiotic wipe. If the material that touches the skin becomes too worn out you can replace just that layer. The rest of the vest or insole is totally reusable and doesn’t need to be replaced.</p>

Thin Ice is in the prototype stage and has not gone through rigorous trials at this time. The 500-1000 calories a day estimate is based on  extrapolations from prototype results and peer-reviewed scientific literature involving similar temperatures and bodily areas stimulated.
 
THE STORY
How the metabolic hack works
Did you know you can trick your body into thinking it’s in a colder environment than it actually is by stimulating specific regions with cold temperatures? This creates a cascade of physiological responses in your body that kick your metabolism into overdrive, As a result, you burn unwanted fat and get leaner, all while letting your body do the work for you! 
Based on estimates derived from our prototypes, competitors and scientific literature we estimate that you'll be able to burn between 500 and 1000 calories a day, just by wearing our clothing for the recommended duration. That's 1 to 2 pounds a week!
 
 Wait, won’t I feel cold?
Don’t worry, this stimulation is so mild you’ll forget all about it after just a few seconds of adaptation. The same concept is at play every time you wade into a pool. You feel cold for a few seconds and then the sensation vanishes. The pool doesn’t warm up, it’s your body that starts to burn from within to counteract its new environment. 
Besides, if you do feel the chill you can always adjust the temperature of your Thin Ice clothing via smartphone to accommodate your comfort level. At Thin Ice, we want to have a long-term weight-management relationship with you. It's not in our best interest to scare you away by making you uncomfortably cold!
 
How Does Thin Ice Clothing Harness the Metabolism Hack? 
The Thin Ice insole and vest target regions of your body with high concentrations of thermoreceptors. These neural receptors alert your body to the presence of cold, triggering a metabolic response that generates heat in your core. 
As the core’s blood warms, it then must be pumped all the way to the extremities. The best part of this process is that your body does all this calorie-expensive work automatically without you even having to think about it. 

 
 
What's the Science Behind Thin Ice!?
The bodily pathway responsible for this heat generation is called the Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT) pathway. This pathway basically functions as your body’s internal thermostat. Even in room temperature, roughly 50% of your daily calories are burnt for no other reason than to keep your body at a comfortable temperature. 
Notice that you undergo NO shivering at room temperature. This is because the BAT pathway is completely different than the shivering mechanism. Thin Ice stimulates BAT and will not make you shiver. This allows Thin Ice’s patent-pending weight-loss technology to help you burn excess calories while being hidden discretely in clothing and apparel items.
 
Show Me the Research!
Thin Ice products might sound too good to be true, but we are proud to say that their underlying concept is based on decades of rigorous peer-reviewed scientific research.
HERE is a nifty article explaining some studies that help to validate the Thin Ice insoles: 
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1207237/How-sticking-feet-cold-water-help-lose-weight.html
And HERE are some respected journals and their published findings on the subject:

The Science at Work
Besides the scientific articles on the subject matter there are also a tonne of anecdotal examples of the same temperature-related weight-loss effects at play. One of the most salient examples is that of Michael Phelps' diet as he trained for the Beijing Olympics. During that time he ate the 12,000 calories seen below on a daily basis:


 
Phelps was able to eat all of that (6 times more than the average person) while staying ripped. Only about half this calorie intake is explainable by his exercise regime and basal metabolic rate. The thousands of missing calories are accounted for by considering Phelps trained in a pool as opposed to land for 4 hours a day. 
Water is 14 times more thermally conductive than air is. This means heat was leaving Phelps' body much faster than it would have if he was on land leading to massive calorie burning to create heat to keep him warm. This is the exact same process that is at play with Thin Ice products, albeit without the sogginess!
BAT also helps to explain why: People scaling Mt. Everest need to pound back sticks of butter not to die of starvation and why people living in climates with more pronounced seasons (including cold ones) tend to have a slightly easier time keeping off weight.
This weight-loss method has been hiding in plain sight throughout our struggles and failed weight-loss attempts. Don't let it sneak away again! Pre-order Thin Ice now!
If you are keen to embrace your inner nerd, there is more science we are happy to share with you. Check out the FAQ, and, if you don’t find the information you’re looking for, just ask us!
  Hold on, can’t I just turn down my thermostat?
You can! In fact, many doctors recommend that you should add this to your weight-loss regimes. However, you can’t bring a cold room with you everywhere you go, nor would you want to as cold rooms can cause us to shiver. Imagine how popular you’d be at the water cooler if you tried to keep the office shiver-worthy!
The brilliant part of the Thin Ice system is that the entire foot/torso doesn’t need to be kept cold, but only strategically chosen areas targeted by the cooling surface. This targeting means less discomfort while maintaining substantial metabolic response.
Best of all, the cooling you experience is totally adjustable to suit your comfort levels through your smart device. This effect will also persist for as long as you want - at the times you want - anywhere you go. So, yes you can turn down your thermostat but remember there’s no need to shiver at home to lose weight. Thin Ice has your back (and feet).
 
What comprises Thin Ice Technology?
Thin Ice technology uses specialized Peltier cooling chips to chill specific areas of the body. Peltier chips are also found in other technologies with compact cooling requirements such as microprocessors and various electronics. They essentially act as heat pumps, forcing heat to one side and leaving the other side cool. 

These chips are powered by an unobtrusive, rechargable battery. The warmed sides of the Peltier chips are located on the bottom of the insole. The warmth generated by the Peltier mechanism can be dissipated through a variety of heat sink materials. 
There are also technologies that are able to capture heat and convert heat into electricity that are currently being explored by our engineering team. The Thin Ice engineering team is currently hard at work making sure the best possible heat dissipation/capturing mechanisms are combined in the final prototype for maximal comfort and battery efficiency. Hey, that reminds me, meet our engineering team!
 
The Thin Ice Engineering Team

Thin Ice also worked with a student engineering team from George Brown College on a contract dedicated specifically to exploring mechanism to increase battery life through connect mechanisms and for dissipating the warmth produced by the base of the Peltier chips.
Finally, Thin Ice has project in the works at York University in Toronto through their Innovation York program including 2 engineering specialist professors. The project is in the final stages of its review process. These professors would be exploring the optimal materials to maximize the effectiveness of Thin Ice products.

There is no shortage of talented minds working on the Thin Ice product research and development. For this reason, we expect to surmount all the engineering hurdles remaining in the Thin Ice product development project and to deliver you your very own Thin Ice package in line with our projected dates.
 
A closer look at our products

The top of the insole is made of a graphite based material perfect for skin contact. At the bottom we have a special heat sink insulating material that works well with the 5 Peltier Chips that reside within, which dissipate heat using power from a rechargeable battery located in the arch support. Our engineering team will work to incorporate several kinetic power charging technologies into the final product. The more you walk the more you charge the battery!
*Thin Ice reserves the right to change any of the above materials for ones that prove superior in the remainder of our product development testing*

The Thin Ice Story
Thin Ice was created by personal trainer, former NCAA Athlete, University of Toronto Alumni in Neuroscience and Psychology, Adam Paulin, who is passionate about fitness and human performance. Here is his description of his journey:
“I’ve spent a lot of time asking myself how we can hack our bodies into optimal performance using science. There is a certain satisfaction in making your body do your bidding"".

 
In Tim Ferris's revolutionary book, the 4-Hour Body - which everyone should check out - he talks extensively about cold temperatures and their weight-loss effects. I wondered why no one had harnessed this method in product form. There had to be a way to make using cold temperatures for weight-loss more convenient without having to suffer through 20 minutes of hell in an ice bath.
What stood out the most in the book was Tim’s comparison of the effects of ice baths versus stimulation using ice packs. What Tim demonstrated is that simply wearing an ice pack on certain parts of the neck you could expect to see 60% of the weight-loss effects as a 20 minute (torture-worthy) ice bath. Using a method you could implement thoughtlessly while watching Friends, you could see a big portion of the results you would achieve shivering away your calories for 20 minutes.
As a personal trainer at the time, I began to see the biggest factor stopping people from achieving an effective weight-loss regime. Clients would come up with every excuse under the sun to skip a session, but it really came down to one thing: going to the gym was not convenient. I knew this ice pack hack was the way to go, but was distracted from considering the matter further until I finished my studies at the University of Toronto. When I was done with my undergrad I knew I wanted to take at least one year off before braving med school applications so I did the only logical thing: I started inventing products.
 

 
This is when I remembered the potential of harnessing the cold temperatures to induce weight-loss. The Thin Ice shoe (the precursor to the Thin Ice insole) came to me quite early but I didn’t see its true potential right away. When I started telling people I was inevitably met with the same look of shock and amazement. “So, what you’re saying is I can lose weight all day and night just by wearing an insole?”. “Yes you can!”, I’d say. I started to realize I had something on my hands worth pursuing, so I learned to be an entrepreneur through many trials and errors, and benefitted from the mentorship of some of the greatest minds I’ve had the privilege to meet. 
I assembled an amazing team and the idea started to materialize. We now have a proof of concept prototype and a pitch in front of the CBC's Dragons under our belt, 
 Dragons' Den was a surreal experience. Imagine walking down echoing stairs into the pitch black den only to be confronted with five rich investment giants when the lights are abruptly flicked on. You just have to remember you're one of the few people who will ever get this opportunity and continue with your pitch! I've sworn secrecy of the results of our appearance until the end of the next season but hopefully you'll be able to me on the show next fall or winter!""
 
What will we do with $15,000?
This is the minimum amount we need when combined with our other sources of financing to develop the product, perform any required modifications, manufacture it and ship it to our backers. 
By helping us get this very valuable funding and voting with your feet, we can put all the pieces of the puzzle together and provide you with your very own Thin Ice system.
Why you should support us
We really think that this product will be a disruptive force in the weight-loss industry. A revolution in convenience, effectiveness and design. We would love to have you be on the front lines with us getting this product to the masses.  That's why were are currently offering 35-50% OFF the projected retail price of our products.  It's our way of saying thank you for supporting us in our infancy :)
Here are several reasons why more financing is a better thing for you as a backer:

It will allow us finish development and get you the product faster.
It will allow us to run trials that help to quantify the results of the product so we can add standardized results to the app. This will let you know how many calories you’re losing using Thin Ice technology on a second-to-second basis!
It will allow us to start aggressively marketing our brand globally so we can alert people around the world of our new approach to weight-loss and help them to join the movement.

There are a bunch of discrete milestones we hope we can reach with you and we’ll be sure to keep you updated on which ones we’re approaching next! There will also be something new and exciting we can do with the brand with additional funding.
 
 
Another great reason to support this campaign
We will match 5% of all funds raised on Indiegogo with the direct purchase of food that we will send to hungry children around the world. We have partnered up with RTG group to carry out this task. Together we can balance the global scale of the malnourished by leaning out the overfed and feeding the hungry. Every 6 seconds a child dies from starvation or malnutrition. Help us re-calibrate that clock, one child at a time while simultaneously investing in your own health. There is a reason ""RTG"" stands for ""Receiving Through Giving"".

We are in the process of writing the Thin Ice Lifestyle book and plan to deliver on that by October. This will get your weight-loss results flying out of the gate and set the stage for you to take off once the technology is delivered. In that book we plan to provide you with the most convenient, effective and simple lifestyle guide to help you meet and exceed your weight-loss goals while optimizing your health and keeping your timebank full.
For sneak peeks of some of the strategies outlined in the book feel free to email us at support!
 
The Product Line
Our goal is to make the last deliveries of the Thin Ice products (insoles and vest) by Christmas. We will be transparent with all our backers about all updates to this schedule, positive or negative. We’ll be honest with you all the way through and will do everything we can to deliver on our projected timeline.
Iceland Getaway 
Our trip to Iceland will be slotted for April when the country is experiencing some of its best weather. The trip will be a retreat to experience the famous Norwegian hot and cold spa treatments which are some of the most ancient applications of the science behind Thin Ice. Join us to celebrate the final deliveries of the Thin Ice products in beautiful surroundings.
During the trip we'll also have top-secret company meetings and reveal to you, before anyone else on the planet, what the winning clothing addition to the Thin Ice line. Don't forget to cast your vote to change the course of Thin Ice history!
Video Service
Our video service will be provided on an ongoing basis starting a month or so after the campaign has subsided and the dust has settled. We’ll help create killer videos for our backers in the order that they purchased the package. The timing will largely depend on the amount of interest. Please take a look at a more detailed description of this perk in our FAQ section.
 FAQ

Where do we ship? 
Shipping is available WORLDWIDE and is automatically calculated based on the country you select in the purchasing process. Shipping to Canada and US is 10 USD and shipping internationally is 49 USD.
When should I ideally use the Thin Ice Vest? 
The vest is light and comfortable enough to be slept in and versatile enough to wear under common clothing. It is sleeveless so you can wear it with a variety of outfits. The vest can also be worn safely to bed where you can burn significant calories while you are fast asleep. 
When should I ideally use the Thin Ice Insole? 
The insole is most effective when walking, sitting, commuting, working at a desk, lounging and generally going about your day. The insole can be worn in almost all footwear, including open toe shoes so you can even be burning fat during a night on the town.
What is the warranty?
We offer a 1 year warranty on the mechanical parts. The layer of the product that touches the skin is replaceable however, so you can buy those parts to keep the vest or insole looking and feeling (and smelling) like new. 
 
Technical FAQ
How do I charge the insole/vest? 
The insole and vest will be fully rechargeable using a charging pad which will be included with the product.  
Does it work with iOS and Android Devices?  
Yes, the app will be available for iOS and Android.

How long does the battery last?  

Around 4-8 hours for the insole, 6-8 for the vest. This may change depending on how much juice we can squeeze out of the kinetic mechanism. Remember, the more you walk the longer the insole battery will last. Walking more never hurt anybody in the weight-loss department either :)

How long does the battery take to charge?  

Around two hours from a fully discharged state.
What temperature range does it work with?
The temperature ranges from very mild to relatively intense. We are still streamlining the exact, optimal range to have you losing the most fat with the most possible comfort.
How safe is the insole for weight bearing?
You can safely wear the insole during low intensity activities like walking, lounging, commuting, working at your desk and doing everyday things. We recommend avoiding weight bearing exercises such as weight lifting, running, or any high impact sports. The vest is a good alternative for weight bearing activities that put pressure on the feet such as jogging.
What is the recommended length of use for the insole/vest?
As long as you feel comfortable with. If you experience any discomfort adjust settings using your smart device.  
How do you wash the product?
For everyday cleaning it is recommended to use an antibiotic wipe. If the material that touches the skin becomes too worn out you can replace just that layer. The rest of the vest or insole is totally reusable and doesn’t need to be replaced.
 
Other FAQ
Can I get the insole/vest in my size? 
Yes, the insoles come in the standard range of shoes sizes, women’s 6-10, and men’s 8-12. The vests come in sizes ranging from S-XXL for both men and women. If you ask us we can probably also accommodate child sizes. After all, little Jimmy can't run 5K while he's playing video games but he can lose weight wearing Thin Ice.
Who did your movie? 
Our movie was put together by us! If you enjoyed the video and want us to help you create your own please refer to the applicable perk.
The service includes 1.) a consultation session or two to flush out your idea and help craft the script. 2.) The organization of a day long shoot where in we arrange for a videographer to record you talking about your product, filming some b-roll and product demos, and 3.) professional editing, graphics, music and sound mixing. 
Depending on your location, the organization of the shoot will require some negotiation. So please talk to us! We’re a friendly bunch.
Can I change or cancel my perk?
Indiegogo policy dictates that campaign owners have no ability to adjust perk selections. That means we cannot upgrade your perk, we cannot change your perk and we cannot cancel your perk. Please note that contributions made on Indiegogo are also non-refundable.
How do I get the Early Bird pricing?
You’ll have to hurry as we only offer a limited quantity of Thin Ice products at such a ridiculously low price. What do you want from us!? We're already giving you 50% off for the products' projected retail price!
Does the Thin Ice apparel offer different colour choices?
As Henry Ford was fond of saying, “You can choose any colour you’d like - as long as it’s black.” The clothing and insoles are black, but since they will most likely be hidden underneath your clothing, it won’t affect your fashion. However, if we receive a certain amount of requests for a specific colour through support, we’d be more than happy to accommodate those requests. Please feel free to share your ideas.
Will people with chronic diseases be able to use the product?
People with poor circulation or diabetes should consult their physician before using the products. This product does not cure any chronic conditions.
If I have questions, how can I reach your team? 
Please read through the FAQ first to find your answer.

<h2><strong>""we cast seashells by the seashore...""</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Who We Are?</strong></p>
<p>We are Karen and Heather Hendry, twin sisters and business partners. We are true water babies; inspired by our zodiac sign cancer. Karen has always had a flair for creativity and Heather the more business minded in marketing/sales. Growing up it wasn't unlikely to have Heather write Karen's essays and Karen complete Heathers' art projects. DREAM TEAM!</p>
<p>Karen has been experimenting with jewelry making for years and has always been drawn to natural elements. One day it clicked and the idea to cast seashells to create timeless pieces was made! With the help of her mentors and fellow jewelry makers, Karen made her first ring with Jessie Turner, who connected her to Tien at the Beaumont Studios, who then introduced her to Naomi Levitin. Naomi taught her the art of wax injection and by then she was well on her way to creating the karenjess brand! </p>
<p>We have been working on karenjess as a hobby for the last 4 years, while holding down full-time jobs, as well as part-time serving gigs to keep karenjess moving forward. Karen spends her days working for TOMS shoes as their BC/Alberta retail marketing coordinator and her nights in the studio designing and handmaking karenjess. Heather most recently worked as Sombrio's marketing manager but left that behind to move to Tofino, BC and focus on building the karenjess brand.</p>
<p><strong>Why You Should Shell Out For karenjess?</strong></p>
<p>We have put so much love and energy into karenjess and are proud to create local, handmade pieces that hold an emotional connection. Imagine being on vacation... sand in your toes, ocean breeze in your hair...strolling down the beach with the sun kissing your face. More often than not you beachcomb to collect shells to remember your trip by. We create a timeless piece of jewelry that takes you back to that moment in time. We are not driven by fleeting trends but stay true to creating timeless pieces that connects you back to the magic of the ocean.</p>
<p><strong>Where's The Indiegogo $$$ Going?</strong></p>
<p>It's important we maintain a collective vibe and support local talent to help us execute all the big pieces to grow karenjess. We are currently working with a team of local talent to bring all the pieces together and we need your help paying them! </p>
<p>Jesse Williams, a talented Vancouver artist has created our new logo/branding which is being used throughout our campaign. We LOVE it. We will need him to develop our marketing collateral further to be used for wholesale accounts, as well as at the local markets.</p>
<p>A HUGE piece of the growth is launching a new ecommerce website, which is being lead by the web genius Joel Tougas. This will allow us to increase our reach on a global market and connect with ocean lovers worldwide. We have already had success seeding the brand downunder in Australia!</p>
<p>Product photography is being shot by the talented Brian Tait. Some of his beautiful images are uploaded in the Gallery section of our campaign. He was able to capture the jewelry in its element at our local Jericho Beach.</p>
<p>It has always been a BIG DREAM to execute an editorial photoshoot. When Vancouver's leading stylist Mila Franovic approached us to develop a shoot for Spring/Summer 2013 we were STOKED! She put together a team of local talent and made our dream a reality. Thank you to the photographer Matthew Burditt, hair Sabrina Karem, make-up Jenna Kuchera and beautiful model Nathalie Ludwig from the Liz Bell Agency. A few sneak peak shots are uploaded in the gallery. BEAUTIFUL! </p>
<p>Karen has been fortunate to work out of the Beaumont in Tien Neo Eamas studio. Money raised will be used to build her own collection of tools, such as her own wax injector which runs for over $300. As well as building a growing inventory of product to have ready once the new website launches.</p>
<p>Lots of works to be done with your help!!!</p>
<p><strong>Please Spread The Word! </strong></p>
<p>Please share our campaign link/video throughout your social channels and help us reach our goal! We thank each and everyone of you for shelling out for karenjess and supporting our dream!!!</p>
<p>BIG THANK YOU to Charlie Grinnel and Kuba Wiatrak who shot and edited our campaign video. Wouldn't have come alive without you guys! Another thank you to our fav local Vancouver band Hey Ocean! for letting us use their song ""Big Blue Wave"" and RipCurl Canada and videographer Adam Chilton for the surf shots. </p>
<p>Make sure to check out our collection of images in the Gallery section of our campaign. We have put together a collage of images that highlight what we have been up to! </p>

<p>It all started at a party, talking to friends. One of them talked about just having bought a new
fragrance - and then shortly after, meeting another women using the exact same
perfume. The idea was born: We are unique - Our most personal accessory, our
smell, should be unique too!</p>

We have been working for years to make this intriguing
idea turn into reality. At first we have tried to do it all by ourselves, experimenting
with all kinds of essential oils. Soon we realized that we needed professional
help. We have been working with great perfumers, designers and engineers in the
US, in Europe and across the world. We have developed the progressive UNIQUE fragrance technology which has been awarded the Global Innovation Award, the
Service Innovation Award and the Think Different Innovation Award. Now we want
to bring this great product to the market, launching our website and opening
our perfume lab in NYC, USA. Our vision: Making perfume UNIQUE!<br/><br/>

a crew of highly motivated fragrance professionals with an ambition to change

Each fragrance is packed and shipped by hand, and our service consultants are available for any requests you may have.




It all started at a party, talking to friends. One of them talked about just having bought a new
fragrance - and then shortly after, meeting another women using the exact same
perfume. The idea was born: We are unique - Our most personal accessory, our
smell, should be unique too!

We have been working for years to make this intriguing
idea turn into reality. At first we have tried to do it all by ourselves, experimenting
with all kinds of essential oils. Soon we realized that we needed professional
help. We have been working with great perfumers, designers and engineers in the
US, in Europe and across the world. We have developed the progressive UNIQUE fragrance technology which has been awarded the Global Innovation Award, the
Service Innovation Award and the Think Different Innovation Award. Now we want
to bring this great product to the market, launching our website and opening
our perfume lab in NYC, USA. Our vision: Making perfume UNIQUE!










The UNIQUE team is
a crew of highly motivated fragrance professionals with an ambition to change
the world of perfumery. We joined forces because we believe in a world of mass
consumption and anonymity there is need for something new. Because we want to
embrace the value of true craftsmanship and individuality. Because we believe
true luxury is UNIQUE.

<p></p>
<p>Hello, my name is Claire Emma Harris
and I am the person behind Emma Harris Lingerie.  I’ve worked in the
fashion industry for many years as a designer / pattern technician. 
Around 6 years ago, I decided to start working for myself as a freelance
designer and product developer, my workload grew rapidly until I simply had too
much work for one person and I opened a small design studio.  The studio
now employs 3 people, we manufacture for many high end lingerie brands. 
With every spare hour that I can grab, I work on my own brand Emma Harris
Lingerie.</p>
<p>The Emma Harris studio is based in
the UK.  The collection is made in-house from luxury silks and lace and is
handmade.  I spend hours upon hours perfecting the fit and design of my
new collections.  I’m passionate about producing luxury lingerie that my customers
will cherish. The brand is growing organically, and we are regularly featured
in online magazines, blogs and the occasional glossy mag.  We are
currently preparing to send our new Autumn Winter collection to our UK
stockists as our sales during the last season has been very good.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/824593/files/20140831112250-Signature_Steel_-_half_padded_plunge_-_lace_front_skinny_thong.jpg?1409509370"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>Getting brand recognition is
extremely hard.  It takes hard work &amp; dedication but most of all it
costs money.  You can have the most fantastic product, but you really need
to get your potential customers to see it, for them to want to buy it. 
This is where I am asking for your help.</p>
<p>Currently the Emma Harris design
studio produces on average 90 pairs of knickers and 90 bras per week. 
That’s 9,360 luxury bras and knickers per year for my clients.  I’d dearly
like that number to include a high percentage of Emma Harris pieces.  I
design every piece of the Emma Harris collection, I produce the patterns, the
samples, the production grades and produce the majority of orders myself. 
Many of the Emma Harris orders we send out are produced out of hours in order
to keep to my customer promises. </p>
<p>With your funding,  I will be
able to spend more time on my brand, attend trade shows to gain stockists, pay
for advertisements and improve campaigns.  This will increase brand
awareness, which will increase sales and therefore fund further growth of my
label.  I already have the product and means to manufacture.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/824597/files/20140831112345-limited_edition_-_body.jpg?1409509425"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>There’s a trade show in Paris, Salon
De Lingerie and another in London, the Lingerie Edit.  These shows are 2/3
day events, during which buyers and press are invited to view the
collections.  I’d love Emma Harris to show at these.  This is my best
way to gain stockists.</p>
<p>Advertisements.  Listening to PR
advice, advertising is crucial and includes not only the adverts you view in
glossy magazines, but also gifting of goods and investing in time to get
products featured in articles.  All of which take time and money. #promoEHL</p>
<p>Through my perks, I’m hopefully
showing my appreciation to you.  The secret Facebook page will be
regularly updated with behind the scenes photographs from the new
collection.  You’ll meet my team of lovely machinists and watch as the new
collection develops.  I’d love your feedback too!</p>
<p>The knickers, bras and babydolls sent

<br/><br/></span></h3></div>","Hello, my name is Claire Emma Harris
and I am the person behind Emma Harris Lingerie.  I’ve worked in the
fashion industry for many years as a designer / pattern technician. 
Around 6 years ago, I decided to start working for myself as a freelance
designer and product developer, my workload grew rapidly until I simply had too
much work for one person and I opened a small design studio.  The studio
now employs 3 people, we manufacture for many high end lingerie brands. 
With every spare hour that I can grab, I work on my own brand Emma Harris
Lingerie.
The Emma Harris studio is based in
the UK.  The collection is made in-house from luxury silks and lace and is
handmade.  I spend hours upon hours perfecting the fit and design of my
new collections.  I’m passionate about producing luxury lingerie that my customers
will cherish. The brand is growing organically, and we are regularly featured
in online magazines, blogs and the occasional glossy mag.  We are
currently preparing to send our new Autumn Winter collection to our UK
stockists as our sales during the last season has been very good.


Getting brand recognition is
extremely hard.  It takes hard work & dedication but most of all it
costs money.  You can have the most fantastic product, but you really need
to get your potential customers to see it, for them to want to buy it. 
This is where I am asking for your help.
Currently the Emma Harris design
studio produces on average 90 pairs of knickers and 90 bras per week. 
That’s 9,360 luxury bras and knickers per year for my clients.  I’d dearly
like that number to include a high percentage of Emma Harris pieces.  I
design every piece of the Emma Harris collection, I produce the patterns, the
samples, the production grades and produce the majority of orders myself. 
Many of the Emma Harris orders we send out are produced out of hours in order
to keep to my customer promises. 
With your funding,  I will be
able to spend more time on my brand, attend trade shows to gain stockists, pay
for advertisements and improve campaigns.  This will increase brand
awareness, which will increase sales and therefore fund further growth of my
label.  I already have the product and means to manufacture.


There’s a trade show in Paris, Salon
De Lingerie and another in London, the Lingerie Edit.  These shows are 2/3
day events, during which buyers and press are invited to view the
collections.  I’d love Emma Harris to show at these.  This is my best
way to gain stockists.
Advertisements.  Listening to PR
advice, advertising is crucial and includes not only the adverts you view in
glossy magazines, but also gifting of goods and investing in time to get
products featured in articles.  All of which take time and money. #promoEHL
Through my perks, I’m hopefully
showing my appreciation to you.  The secret Facebook page will be
regularly updated with behind the scenes photographs from the new
collection.  You’ll meet my team of lovely machinists and watch as the new
collection develops.  I’d love your feedback too!
The knickers, bras and babydolls sent
will all have a unique label sewn into them.  It will say ‘I helped launch
Emma Harris’.  My thoughts are that when you see an article or
advertisement featuring Emma Harris, you’ll have a piece of what made it
happen.
If we don’t reach our entire goal,
I’ll carefully decide which trade show I can afford to attend and promise to
spend your funding carefully.  If we exceed our goal, I’ll advertise more,
increase the strength of the campaign and possibly consider another trade show,
Curve.  I could also consider employing another machinist, your funds

<h3>The Story </h3>
<p>It wasn’t until the past few years that I became very health conscious. As a runner, drinking water is not only necessary to sustaining my physical being, but it also nourishes my emotional and mental health. I’ve discovered that no matter how tough my day is, no matter the challenges that come my way, no matter the physical or emotional discomfort that I’m in, if I’m drinking enough water, I’ll be okay. </p>
<p>Drinking water also has major health benefits like removing toxins from your system, improving skin health, and above all, nourishing the brain. I was an avid coffee drinker, but this past year, I’ve replaced my daily cup of coffee with water, and I never looked back. Since then, I’ve noticed the changes in my performance when exercising, my physical health, and increased energy level without the feeling of crashing afterwards. Most importantly, I’ve been more willing and ready to take risks and chase after my dreams. If you want to take on the world, start by drinking water. When you feel good about your health, you feel good about yourself and your life. Through my clothing brand, I am able to share this message with the world.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order for this campaign to be successful, we want to raise $500 to be able to kickstart our next phase of production for new items, which includes water bottles, new t-shirt designs and apparel as well as baseball caps. 100% of the funding will go towards production. Contributors will receive a 25% discount on any available item, including new releases (a separate code will be sent out privately). If our entire goal is not achieved, 100% of the amount raised will still go towards production. If necessary, some items may be eliminated for this phase of production until more funds are received. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Although this campaign aims to raise funds for the production of sales items, Stay Hydrated is selling more than products. We are selling the meaning and the impact of what these products can instill in people's lives. This project is extremely valuable in today's day and age where self-care is essential to improving the quality of life. More importantly, for trendsetters and street wear enthusiasts, these particular products stand out as it promotes a more meaningful message while embodying minimalist fashion. The quality of every product is 100% trusted as we've visited the production sites of these materials to ensure quality control. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The first and most apparent challenge would be failing to reach the goal amount. In order to produce all desired items in this next phase of the business and boost engagement and activity, it is crucial that we raise enough funds for production. The most important item for this phase of production is the aluminum water bottles, which are costly. It is possible that all of the funds will go towards producing water bottles over other listed items. However, if we do not reach the desired amount, we may not be able to produce as many water bottles as are demanded. In order to overcome this challenge, there will be great effort in fundraising outside of this platform, mainly through friends and families as well as special incentives. We will leverage our marketing experience and network to increase engagement and activity in order to boost donations and eventually, sales. </p>
<p>Another challenge that may occur after this campaign is the lack of sales and revenue that would ideally filter back into more production. In order to prevent this issue from happening, we will create new marketing strategies and increase publicity as well as engagement in our audience before, during and after the launch of new products. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to donate, no problem! We hope you will help us get the word out about our campaign and more importantly, our mission for Stay Hydrated. </p>

It wasn’t until the past few years that I became very health conscious. As a runner, drinking water is not only necessary to sustaining my physical being, but it also nourishes my emotional and mental health.

<h2><u>Groom like a King. Empower men to shine.</u></h2>
<p>I’m Blue O’Connor and I'm inviting you to help me launch a male aftershave and grooming brand like no other.<br/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524770679/ur77pb6x50sbmjkdwrzm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Kings won’t just offer aftershaves, creams and face washes that make men look great and feel confident. Our mission to ‘empower men to live healthier, happier lives’ will drive every action we take as a company.</p>
<ul>
<li>20% of all our profits will go to male mental health and youth mentoring projects.</li>
<li>Every product we offer will be ethically produced, manufactured in the UK, made using natural ingredients and be registered vegan/cruelty free.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our positive impact won’t stop there. My aim for Kings is to encourage men to challenge the unhealthy, unrealistic ideas that society holds about masculinity; ideas that often contribute to men’s anxiety and low mood.<br/> <br/>Through Kings’ marketing and comms, we’ll invite guys to join a movement that empowers them to think independently, break the mould and live by their own definition of ‘being a man’.</p>
<p>Back our campaign today – and help men reach peak health and happiness.</p>

<p><strong>What does it smell like?</strong> A fresh, sharp scent that is light and floral, with a perfectly balanced sweetness and woody feel . It's ideal for the summer months! Made with natural essential oils: patchouli, cardamon, vetivert, copaiba, ylang and eucalyptus.</p>

<h2><u>Goals</u></h2>
<p>With your support we are aiming to raise £10,000. We don't just want to 'start-up' Kings, we want to launch our brand with a bang! And that's why we have three stretch goals of £15,000, £20,000 and £25,000.</p>

<h2><u>Why the world needs Kings</u></h2>
<p>Kings was born out of my personal struggles with mental health. I’d always suffered from social anxiety and during my mid-twenties this progressed to high levels of anxiety and stress.</p>
<p>Everything came to a head the day before my 25th birthday. While driving home from work, I suddenly felt severe pain in my chest and numbness in my hands. I thought I was having a heart attack – but I later realised it was a panic attack.</p>
<p><i><strong>As a man, I felt an overwhelming sense of shame. In my mind, it was down to me to solve this problem and I had to do it alone.</strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong>I felt trapped, because although I knew I needed help, I believed that reaching out would be ‘unmanly’.</strong></i></p>
<p>I carried on until the situation got so bad that something had to change. I started to address my whole lifestyle – diet, social life, career, thinking patterns and more. Eventually, I quit my job to travel the world.</p>
<p>I was lucky that I was in a financial position to take time out. Having grown up in one of Bristol’s most deprived areas, I was all too aware that many other men do not have this luxury, or access to the support they need to beat anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>My incredible round-the-world trip gave me the time and space to realise what I was passionate about: <strong>social change!</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523710251/gurjlefqsztn3t1yz7q6.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>The birth of a mission-led grooming business</h3>
<p>When I returned to the UK, I changed my career and also became a youth mentor. At the time I was struggling to find grooming products that were a good fit for my values and lifestyle. There seemed to be no quality aftershaves that were ethically produced and cruelty free. And there were definitely no aftershaves that ‘gave back’ to the causes close to my heart.</p>
<p>Out of this frustration, the idea for Kings – a grooming business with a mission – was born. I decided to create a ‘social enterprise’ that would use 20% of all profits to empower men to live their best lives.</p>
<p>I can’t do this alone; but with your backing I can launch Kings, and together we can help build a world of healthier, happier men.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><u>Kings' Impact</u></h2>
<p>20% of all Kings profits will be reinvested into male mental health and youth projects – starting today. So when you back our campaign, part of your money will go directly towards empowering men to turn their lives around.</p>
<p>Help us launch Kings, and we’ll be able to carry on transforming men’s lives into the future.</p>
<p>You’ll be benefiting two high-impact local charities – Mentoring Plus and Bristol Mind – as well as Kings’ own flagship project: to build calisthenics parks (urban gyms) to improve the health and well-being of young men.</p>
<h3>Kings urban gym</h3>
<p>We’ll build outdoor calisthenics parks (body-weight gyms) in areas of deprivation in Bristol, where we’ll run health and well-being workshops for young men. The aim is to improve their health, fitness and mental well-being, as well as raise their aspirations for the future.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523789216/kbbscyavgsksza8cwxaq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Mentoring Plus</h3>
<p><a href=""http://mentoringplus.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mentoring Plus</a> train and support adult volunteers to mentor 7 to 21 year olds needing extra support with family, education, emotional needs and employability. For every £4,000 Kings donates to Mentoring Plus, they’ll be able to support a young male through mentoring for 12 months.</p>
<p>As a youth mentor myself, I have seen first hand the positive impact that mentoring can have on a young person. I have seen dramatic improvements in confidence and self-esteem in the young person I've personally mentored. </p>
<p>Mentoring Plus’ own research has shown that mentoring has a positive impact on 100% of mentees – enabling them to feel happier, manage their behavior and have improved family relationships.</p>

<h3>Bristol Mind</h3>
<p>The Bristol branch of the nationwide charity, <a href=""http://bristolmind.org.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bristol Mind</a> exist to promote the well-being and recovery of people living with mental health problems.</p>
<p>After gaining a degree of control and understanding of my own mental health and well-being, I am now on a learning path to empower other people. I am trained in Mental Health First Aid through <a href=""https://mhfaengland.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MHFA England</a> and I will develop my skills and knowledge alongside the growth of Kings. </p>

<p><strong>James </strong>- <i>""Because it was vegan, I assumed the fragrance would smell bad or be low quality. I was wrong! The scent smells great, it lasts all day and the branding is unique.

I’m Blue O’Connor and I'm inviting you to help me launch a male aftershave and grooming brand like no other. 
Kings won’t just offer aftershaves, creams and face washes that make men look great and feel confident. Our mission to ‘empower men to live healthier, happier lives’ will drive every action we take as a company.

20% of all our profits will go to male mental health and youth mentoring projects.
Every product we offer will be ethically produced, manufactured in the UK, made using natural ingredients and be registered vegan/cruelty free.

Our positive impact won’t stop there. My aim for Kings is to encourage men to challenge the unhealthy, unrealistic ideas that society holds about masculinity; ideas that often contribute to men’s anxiety and low mood. Through Kings’ marketing and comms, we’ll invite guys to join a movement that empowers them to think independently, break the mould and live by their own definition of ‘being a man’.
Back our campaign today – and help men reach peak health and happiness.

What does it smell like? A fresh, sharp scent that is light and floral, with a perfectly balanced sweetness and woody feel . It's ideal for the summer months! Made with natural essential oils: patchouli, cardamon, vetivert, copaiba, ylang and eucalyptus.

Goals
With your support we are aiming to raise £10,000. We don't just want to 'start-up' Kings, we want to launch our brand with a bang! And that's why we have three stretch goals of £15,000, £20,000 and £25,000.


 
Why the world needs Kings
Kings was born out of my personal struggles with mental health. I’d always suffered from social anxiety and during my mid-twenties this progressed to high levels of anxiety and stress.
Everything came to a head the day before my 25th birthday. While driving home from work, I suddenly felt severe pain in my chest and numbness in my hands. I thought I was having a heart attack – but I later realised it was a panic attack.
As a man, I felt an overwhelming sense of shame. In my mind, it was down to me to solve this problem and I had to do it alone.
I felt trapped, because although I knew I needed help, I believed that reaching out would be ‘unmanly’.
I carried on until the situation got so bad that something had to change. I started to address my whole lifestyle – diet, social life, career, thinking patterns and more. Eventually, I quit my job to travel the world.
I was lucky that I was in a financial position to take time out. Having grown up in one of Bristol’s most deprived areas, I was all too aware that many other men do not have this luxury, or access to the support they need to beat anxiety and depression.
My incredible round-the-world trip gave me the time and space to realise what I was passionate about: social change!

The birth of a mission-led grooming business
When I returned to the UK, I changed my career and also became a youth mentor. At the time I was struggling to find grooming products that were a good fit for my values and lifestyle. There seemed to be no quality aftershaves that were ethically produced and cruelty free. And there were definitely no aftershaves that ‘gave back’ to the causes close to my heart.
Out of this frustration, the idea for Kings – a grooming business with a mission – was born. I decided to create a ‘social enterprise’ that would use 20% of all profits to empower men to live their best lives.
I can’t do this alone; but with your backing I can launch Kings, and together we can help build a world of healthier, happier men.
 
Kings' Impact
20% of all Kings profits will be reinvested into male mental health and youth projects – starting today. So when you back our campaign, part of your money will go directly towards empowering men to turn their lives around.
Help us launch Kings, and we’ll be able to carry on transforming men’s lives into the future.
You’ll be benefiting two high-impact local charities – Mentoring Plus and Bristol Mind – as well as Kings’ own flagship project: to build calisthenics parks (urban gyms) to improve the health and well-being of young men.
Kings urban gym
We’ll build outdoor calisthenics parks (body-weight gyms) in areas of deprivation in Bristol, where we’ll run health and well-being workshops for young men. The aim is to improve their health, fitness and mental well-being, as well as raise their aspirations for the future.

Mentoring Plus
Mentoring Plus train and support adult volunteers to mentor 7 to 21 year olds needing extra support with family, education, emotional needs and employability. For every £4,000 Kings donates to Mentoring Plus, they’ll be able to support a young male through mentoring for 12 months.
As a youth mentor myself, I have seen first hand the positive impact that mentoring can have on a young person. I have seen dramatic improvements in confidence and self-esteem in the young person I've personally mentored. 
Mentoring Plus’ own research has shown that mentoring has a positive impact on 100% of mentees – enabling them to feel happier, manage their behavior and have improved family relationships.

Bristol Mind
The Bristol branch of the nationwide charity, Bristol Mind exist to promote the well-being and recovery of people living with mental health problems.
After gaining a degree of control and understanding of my own mental health and well-being, I am now on a learning path to empower other people. I am trained in Mental Health First Aid through MHFA England and I will develop my skills and knowledge alongside the growth of Kings.

Testimonials
James - ""Because it was vegan, I assumed the fragrance would smell bad or be low quality. I was wrong! The scent smells great, it lasts all day and the branding is unique. When you combine this with the fact it's ethical and 20% of the profits go to social causes then you end up struggling to find reasons not to buy it.""

Samantha - ""This is a fantastic gift idea for my partner because the product not only smells great but also is vegan-friendly and ethical.”

Adam - ""As a vegan, I've sometimes struggled to find brands and products that match my personal ethics and values. Kings is a brand that I can trust and support. I know every time I buy a product from Kings that it's vegan, cruelty free and supports men through mental health and youth mentoring""

But before your neck starts to feel warm, it’ll take a little time before your body temperature warms up the scarf. So we thought, wouldn’t it be even better if this scarf could generate warmth on its own?Active Portable WarmthInstead of putting on layers of clothes “ just “ to keep your body temperature at best, there is a better way. SUSTAIN Sport Heated scarf generates heat higher than your body temperature to fight off coldness, proactively provides the heat your body needs to feel warm right when you need it!SUSTAIN SPORT Heated scarf is a soft and lightweight scarf with an ultra-efficient graphene fiber heating core providing almost instant warmth. With the use of silver nano processed anti-bacterial fabrics, quick drying and breathable properties keep your neck comfortable at all times.Quickly absorbs moisture to keep you dry under the scarf.Quick adaption to climate changesDrastic climate change affects all us all. The temperature can drop 29 Fahrenheit (15 degrees) from the mid-day to the evening. We know you want a hassle-free garment.Graphene carbon fiber heating core, providing heat in 15 secs.2 constant heat settings, 107 ℉/114℉ (42℃/46℃), can be easily toggled to fit your needs.Silver nano processed fabricsSilver nano is an effective agent in defending against bacteria. Since scarves are worn close to the mouth and nose area, it’s crucial to make this scarf anti-bacterial and allergen-free. ( Official test report included in the specs section )Silver nano embedded particles protect against invading bacteria as soon as they are attached to the fabric.
Ultra slim and soft  
Highly efficient and stable 
Waterproof and durable 
Graphene carbon fiber heating coreThanks to the ultra-efficient graphene carbon fiber heating system embedded in the SUSTAIN Sport Heated scarf, one full charge will keep your neck warm for more than 3 hours.Up to 3.5 hrs of use on one charge. ( Could vary under different ambient temperature conditions ).If you wish to use your own or a larger capacity power bank, you can make use of the USB extension cable included and leave the power bank in your pocket.Easy to wear system - So quick and easy to wear Never get tangled up in long scarves again! Long scarves are often very bulky around the neck and can take a while to wrap on and unwrap. SUSTAIN heated scarf's easy to wear system enables you to put it on and take it off within seconds. Magnets stitched within the scarf, no more bulky wrapping around. These 2 ways of wearing lets you quickly adapt to the environment, so if you frequently move in-between indoors and outdoors, just simply change between the 2 ways.Far infrared emissionSUSTAIN SPORT heated scarf uses a special fabric that induces far-infrared (FIR) emission when heated. The merits of FIR is that the warmth penetrates deeper under the skin and it creates a microclimate in between the neck and the scarf, making the heated scarf comfortable to wear without feeling dryness during wearing.After a long day at work spending a long time looking down on our smartphone and laptop, it is time to give your neck a good rest. Put on our comfortable warming scarf, sit back & relax the tense neck muscles. It is like the comfort of a hot towel on your neck, but it doesn’t get cold. Minimal, low keyed designed, it is so easy to match with your outfit.SUSTAIN SPORT Heated Scarf comes in Steel grey, Navy and Red. Premium packaging makes a perfect gift for every occasion.Simply put in the power bank and press the button to start heating.     Started in 2013, HOMI CREATIONS was established for the causes of a seamless lifestyle we envision.The SUSTAIN collection was established to create advanced clothing, we have chosen a scarf to be our first product, because we know how people depend on it for extra warmth and how it could be carried with easily. Utilizing advanced technology, we blend in between different industries, we add in fashion elements and design in the fabrics we use, relying on traditional stitching works to finish the final product. SUSTAIN SPORT is a perfect collaboration across technology, design, fashion, and craftsmanship. To redefine the present way we live and things we use with simpler, easier, cleaner, minimalistic products, creating a modern and seamless lifestyle is what we envision and set out to achieve. 1. How do I clean SUSTAIN SPORT?We recommend to clean with a damp cloth and leave it dry before use again. You can also hand-wash if you wish, only to make sure the power bank has been taken out and the USB cap is on. Do not dry clean or tumble dry.2. Will it overheat with time?The 2 heat settings are constant and they do not get hotter with time, for some sensitive groups, we suggest you to stop using it as soon as you feel the temperature is too high. 60 mins auto-shut off makes sure the contacted area gets a rest from heating.3. How long will the heating last on one charge?With our designated power bank ( 4000 mah ), it could last in between 3 - 3.5 hrs depending on the given temperature conditions.You can also use the USB extension cable included to use your own power bank that might have a larger capacity.4. How heavy is the scarf with the power bank?The total weight is 205g, this is lighter than most of the thicker scarves. During our test trial we have 50 female across all ages to try the scarf, only 1 had shown concerns about the weight while others do not feel any difference in comparison with their own regular scarves.5. Can I use my own power banks?Yes, only our power bank is designed to put in to the hidden pocket in the scarf, if your power bank does not fit into the pocket, you can make use if the USB extension cable included.With our own power bank, you will be able to operate the button on the scarf without switching on the power bank. For other power banks, you might have to switch on the power bank before pressing the button on the scarf.",31.0,0,"1 Campaign

</li></ul></div>","Pharos Watches is proud to announce the Sentinel Collection consisting of two models: the full lume Sentinel and sunburst Sentinel B. Through both of our models we aimed to create a truly unique watch with many distinctive aspects. The result was a watch crafted in avant-garde fashion, creating a timepiece we hope is unlike anything else in the marketplace. The uniqueness of the Sentinel and Sentinel B is evident in the crown (which is lumed), lug curvature, and steel case finished with a variety of polished grooves and brushed notches. The defining feature of the Sentinel Collection is the usage of Swiss SuperLuminova in the dial and crown of each watch.We designed both the full lume Sentinel and sunburst Sentinel B to provide two unique options for multiple tastes. The full lume Sentinel is more eclectic, whereas the Sentinel B is a more traditionally-inspired dive watch. Nevertheless, both models include our signature lume, case design, and fully automatic Swiss movement. A Blog to Watch | WatchTime | The Time Bum | KeepTheTime.comCheck us out at www.pharoswatches.com | Download Our Press PackThe Sentinel has a sandwich dial with a full lume display. Apart from the dial, all other specifications are identical to the Sentinel B. With quality components, detailed craftsmanship, and a unique design, our goal is to provide a high-quality, Swiss automatic watch at an affordable price.While many other watches in the $400 - $900 price range use Japanese movements, Pharos has decided to utilize a fully automatic Swiss movement. Swiss movements are considered the best in the world, and are used by all luxury brands. As such, Pharos aims to deliver a top caliber watch without costing thousands of dollars. The Sentinel B has a sunburst dial with a partial lume ring display. Apart from the dial, all other specifications are identical to the Sentinel.Each Pharos Sentinel and Sentinel B is powered by a Swiss Sellita SW200, automatic movement, complete with 26 jewels. Watch collectors will recognize that automatic movements are far superior to quartz movements. An automatic movement uses energy from the motion of a wearer’s wrist, whereas a quartz movement is powered by a battery. Like all battery operated machines, a quartz watch will need a new battery every couple of years. Watches with automatic movements, like the Sentinel, will continue to run indefinitely (with winding and setting the watch again after long periods without wearing it). Swiss automatic watch movements are considered the most robust and efficient movements in the world. Many Swiss movements have longer power reserve than their Japanese counterparts, require less winding, and are considered more reliable. (Sellita SW200 Automatic Movement in our PVD Sentinel. Photo Courtesy of KeepTheTime.com)All Sentinel models use the highest quality Swiss SuperLuminova in their dials, hands and crowns. This ensures an extremely bright and long-lasting luminescence.Every full lume Sentinel backer will get to decide what color hands they want on their watch (blue or green). This allows you to have consistent lume colors or contrasting lume colors (for legibility).The Sentinel and Sentinel B each have an engraved case back showing the Pharos of Alexandria. (Accurate representation of how the Pharos of Alexandria is believed to have looked)You asked for it and we’ve heard you! We’ve contacted our suppliers and confirmed that we can make this available to ALL of our backers at NO additional charge. That’s right - you will be able to choose your hand lume color for your Sentinel (either matching or contrasting lume). Please look at the photos below to see some examples!Every Sentinel will come with a leather AND rubber strap with quick release functionality. You will get the chance to choose the colors you want when selecting your perk.  Tan & Brown Quick Release Leather Straps with Engraved Logo on BuckleBlue & Black Quick Release Leather Straps with Engraved Logo on Buckle​Black & Blue Quick Release Rubber Straps with Engraved Logo on BuckleAll leather and rubber straps contain a quick release function, making it seamless to change straps.Every Sentinel comes packaged in a sturdy and high quality grey lacquer display box.

<p>We are a socially motivated lifestyle brand that empowers communities worldwide (<a href=""http://apol.is/about"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://apol.is/about</a>). </p>
<br/>
<h2>Why Crowdfunding?</h2>
<p>We believe crowdfunding is a responsible way to manage supply &amp; demand, avoid waste and provide YOU with a price that is 50% less than the retail value.</p>
<br/>

<h2>Mexico and the Industry of Glass Manufacturing:</h2>
<p>Over the last 10 years 75% of all glass blowing studios in Mexico have closed due to global competition. We need YOUR help to support one of the few remaining glass-blowing studios in Mexico by partnering with us and pre-ordering our new collection of Apolis glassware. </p>
<p>The overwhelming local response from these glass blowing studios throughout Mexico was ""Help us better showcase the process, the value, the one-of-a-kind design of each item. No one really quantifies the process, so making the same item robotically for a fraction of the price is better business, but often at the cost ­of the workers or the environment.”</p>
<br/>
<h2>How You Can Help:</h2>
<h4>Buying a piece from our glassware collection will help preserve a dying art form. </h4>
<p>We are introducing the first artisan + designer collaboration marketplace in partnership with Indiegogo. We need YOUR help to support one of the few remaining glass-blowing studios in Mexico by partnering with us and pre-ordering our new collection of Apolis glassware.</p>
<p>Through this business model we want to connect individuals from all walks of life who believe we desperately need to re-think the way we buy and sell.</p>
<br/>
<h2>What We Are Doing:</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_700/v1444105514/p2zdwrl1c3evw6fajrnu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We spent the last year with Studio Xaquixe in Mexico observing &amp; studying any way we could help preserve the art of glass blowing. Their innovative design inspired us to develop a new marketplace to deepen our commitment of empowering communities worldwide. And through that we designed an assortment of 100% recycled glassware, hand-blown by artisans in Oaxaca.</p>
<br/>
<h2>How It Will Work:</h2>
<p>Because we only produce what is ordered, we can avoid thousands of pounds of waste and lost energy – which is a side effect of over producing. And by taking part in this business model,</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_1240/v1443218962/oy9zg34omqwg1plxuswb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h4>Not only will your glassware be half the retail price, but you will have a hand in creating jobs and preserving the art of glass-blowing.</h4>
<br/>
<h2>What We Believe:</h2>
<h4>We believe all people are created equal and should have equal access to the global marketplace.</h4>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_700/v1444105519/s4vebltwhh9da3tiop7h.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Over the last 10 years of building our brand we have discovered a new opportunity for how we can buy and sell products to positively benefit everyone in the supply chain. But it starts with ALL of US — the people who choose what we buy and sell. And if you are anything like us we make our decisions based on design being the most important. So to make this simple we believe good design from the product design to the supply chain design can solve—not marginally sustain—human and environmental problems within our lifetime.</p>

</div></div>","Apolis (a-pöl-is) means “global citizen.”
We are a socially motivated lifestyle brand that empowers communities worldwide (http://apol.is/about). 

Why Crowdfunding?
We believe crowdfunding is a responsible way to manage supply & demand, avoid waste and provide YOU with a price that is 50% less than the retail value.


Mexico and the Industry of Glass Manufacturing:
Over the last 10 years 75% of all glass blowing studios in Mexico have closed due to global competition. We need YOUR help to support one of the few remaining glass-blowing studios in Mexico by partnering with us and pre-ordering our new collection of Apolis glassware. 
The overwhelming local response from these glass blowing studios throughout Mexico was ""Help us better showcase the process, the value, the one-of-a-kind design of each item. No one really quantifies the process, so making the same item robotically for a fraction of the price is better business, but often at the cost ­of the workers or the environment.”

How You Can Help:
Buying a piece from our glassware collection will help preserve a dying art form. 
We are introducing the first artisan + designer collaboration marketplace in partnership with Indiegogo. We need YOUR help to support one of the few remaining glass-blowing studios in Mexico by partnering with us and pre-ordering our new collection of Apolis glassware.
Through this business model we want to connect individuals from all walks of life who believe we desperately need to re-think the way we buy and sell.

What We Are Doing:

We spent the last year with Studio Xaquixe in Mexico observing & studying any way we could help preserve the art of glass blowing. Their innovative design inspired us to develop a new marketplace to deepen our commitment of empowering communities worldwide. And through that we designed an assortment of 100% recycled glassware, hand-blown by artisans in Oaxaca.

How It Will Work:
Because we only produce what is ordered, we can avoid thousands of pounds of waste and lost energy – which is a side effect of over producing. And by taking part in this business model,

Not only will your glassware be half the retail price, but you will have a hand in creating jobs and preserving the art of glass-blowing.

What We Believe:
We believe all people are created equal and should have equal access to the global marketplace.

Over the last 10 years of building our brand we have discovered a new opportunity for how we can buy and sell products to positively benefit everyone in the supply chain. But it starts with ALL of US — the people who choose what we buy and sell. And if you are anything like us we make our decisions based on design being the most important. So to make this simple we believe good design from the product design to the supply chain design can solve—not marginally sustain—human and environmental problems within our lifetime.

We found that affordable active wear was scarcely offered by retailers. How can one motiva<span>te themselves to work out if they can't even afford the clothing to do so?? Enter Hannah's sewing machine and some spandex fabric... Two years and hundreds of experimental products and fabrics later, here we are!! <br/><br/>High Spirits is not only clothing; we want it to be synonymous with happy and healthy living. When people see our logo, we don't want them to only think about yoga pants. High Spirits encompasses an entire way of living with positivity, passion, and pleasure.

Two years and hundreds of experimental products and fabrics later, here we are!! High Spirits is not only clothing; we want it to be synonymous with happy and healthy living.

<p>The <b><a href=""http://izmade.com/izmade-product-margherita-eng"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Margherita lamp</a></b> is a modern home accessory made from reused materials and characterized by a truly end-to-end environmentally conscious production process.</p>

<p>Every day in Turin, Italy, nearly 15,000 tomato sauce cans are used and thrown away by restaurants. We here at Izmade saw this as an opportunity to build a beautiful, impactful object while simultaneously sharing our philosophy of sustainability with the world.</p>

<p>So, how do we make this recycled lamp?</p>
<h4>The Lampshade</h4>
<p>We collect recycled tomato cans from local restaurants in Turin. The recovered cans are then washed, cut, and painted to create the lampshade. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1078756/files/20141207171614-izmade_margherita_cans_operation.jpg?1418001374"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h4>The Stand and the plywood</h4>
<p>The plywood stand comes from beech trees, a species native to the Piedmont region. The layers of plywood are bonded by a renewable <b>soybean adhesive</b>, but the lamp itself is held together <b>without any glue</b>. It takes advantage of the friction between the stand and the connecting parts to hold its shape. </p>

<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>

<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>When I met this young man Mandeep, I was impressed with not only his tennis skills but his humble character and his passion to walk closer with God. Anyone who takes a moment with this young man will walk away not only refreshed but amazed by the courage he has to make it this far.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>By helping him succeed, you will also help many children in impoverished parts of India get a chance to build healthier lives. Mandeep has a goal of eventually working along side Rallying For Life in India to provide children and adults in the slum areas of India to have opportunity to learn the sport, to enhance life skills and create a village of hope!</div>

Mandeep has a goal of eventually working along side Rallying For Life in India to provide children and adults in the slum areas of India to have opportunity to learn the sport, to enhance life skills and create a village of hope!

</h3>I'm
Marcel, known to many as Mickey, M. I. T. educated owner of a value
engineering practice and
Bronx born and bred creator of NYC Wear and Gear, a gifts and
garments line that targets New Yorkers … and
others with style and/or attitude.
<p>Feel
good interactions with fellow native New Yorkers I often encountered
while traveling extensively on business stateside and abroad are what
motivated me to introduce the line, which features items such kindred
spirits and I could wear or use to celebrate our roots and showcase
our shared civic pride. 
</p>
<p>However while
achieving steadily increasing levels of appeal and acceptance in
general, items that bear the trademarked logo of my Bona Fide
New Yorker lifestyle brand, with the exception of caps, have received
a lukewarm reception from folks who like for the designs on their
garments to be significantly larger than sizes that can be
cost-effectively embroidered or who favor design finishes with
diverse looks and feels. 
</p>
<p>So this campaign is to
raise funds sufficient for me to purchase two Hotronix heat presses
and certain accessories. 
</p>
<p>The first, a 16” x 20”
unit capable of placing large versions of  my logo and other graphics
on a variety of garments (T-shirts, tank tops, jerseys, jackets,
hoodies, regular sweatshirts, sweatpants, etc.) and sundry
promotional products, as well as Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars or
other athletic footwear when outfitted with its special shoe platen
and 
</p>
<p>the second, a cap-specific
model to enable placement on headwear (caps, hats, headbands, ear
warmers, visors, SoHoodies, etc.) full color digital transfer designs
that are not large but feature finishes, fine details and/or
gradients that simply cannot be done with embroidery.</p>
<p>Both presses produce
results with the durability of quality screen printing and support
the application of rhinestones and finishes with popular appearances
(3D/Puff, prism-like, glitter/sparkle, sheen, frosted, metallic,
mirror, safety/emergency:reflective and high-visibility neon, colors
that glow in the dark or change when subjected to UV light, etc.)
and/or the feel of a given material (suede, velvet, patent leather).</p>
<p>Your support of my campaign will enable me to invest in the two heat presses, do in-house embellishing of products that will enable me to fill small to medium size orders of customers who fall into the big &amp; bold or diverse look &amp; feel design camps and decorate test or show  garments with such designs which if they prove to be big sellers I will have done in large quantities by commercial screenprinting companies.<br/></p>
<p>But that's not all. In addition to
increasing the NYC Wear and Gear goods embellishment options, I will
use the heat presses to place logos or other graphics on appropriate
items for some of the small high tech firms and other businesses with
which I am allied, as well as for friends who are photographers,
graphic or performing artists, organizers of reunions, or members of
school clubs or organizations, who not only lack the financial
resources of large companies but often require quantities less than
those at which screenprinting becomes economically attractive. 
</p>
<p>The relationships I've been
cultivating and nurturing with custom screen printed transfer sheet specialists, who
instead of printing directly onto products will print my logos and
any other graphics I specify onto special release materials for
transfer to items of interest whenever I choose using the proposed
heat presses, and being able to operate the presses myself when
necessary, will enable me to handle special requirements or last
minute jobs of my friends/associates and at my discretion reduce or
even completely eliminate labor charges to permit them to still
proceed with projects even when their funds are especially
tight.</p>
<p>Also I'll be
positioned to produce creatively embellished pieces to sell and
secure funds to supplement my personal donations to 501(c)(3) non
profit organizations such as A Better Chance, AIDS Action Committee,
Baruch College, Bronx Museum Of The Arts, Brooks School, City Squash,
Harlem Children's Zone, Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society,
Massachusetts Institute Of Technology, Massachusetts Prostate Cancer
Coalition, National Multiple Sclerosis Society and the Simpson
Street Development Association that I have supported or others I
might choose to support in the future.</p>
<p>And last but not
least, I will be able to provide students attending local colleges
with opportunities to make money working as part-time press operators
or through their own entrepreneurial endeavors marketing and selling
NYC Wear and Gear's heat press embellished items. <br/></p>
<p>So please back my project
and help make my proposed purchase of the two heat presses a reality
by selecting a perk at the support/contribution level with which you are
comfortable and then sharing word of this campaign with friends,
relatives, associates and anyone else you believe will be inclined to
do the same.</p>
<p>THANK YOU!</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Your Perks<br/>

the fate of many such stores that lost their customers to suburban
malls and closed its doors.</p>
<p>Customer demand for
the store's very popular as well as most profitable body, hair and
skin care products was so great the former company's President wisely
exploited the opportunity, resumed manufacture of those products and over time
successfully cultivated as customers all kinds of boutiques and spas

</div><div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There is no question
as far as feasibility because the heat press equipment in
which I plan to invest is routinely being used by many companies to
embellish goods exactly like those I am offering as
perks. 
</p>
<p>Since March when I
visited the Imprinted Sportswear Show (<b>ISS</b>
is the
largest trade
show dedicated
to the decorated apparel industry) in Atlantic City,<span> where I saw live demos of the heat
presses applying to various items of interest designs of different looks
and feels, met with manufacturers/suppliers of garments, equipment  and materials, obtained answers to my
questions regarding heat presses/accessories &amp; heat transfers, and
attended pertinent presentations, I have been communicating with
representatives of the companies I met  and attending
application-specific webinars to ensure that should I encounter
issues I lack the knowledge or skill to address I will know exactly
who to consult or contract for solutions.</span></p>
<p>The presses, for
which space has already been made available, will be shipping from a Pennsylvania-based sister company of their manufacturer and I have been assured
they keep in stock large quantities of both models as well as any
accessories I might choose to purchase. <br/>I will be obtaining my
transfer sheets from a second sister company that specializes in
custom transfers. <br/>The presses and the transfers typically ship
the day after receipt of an order with 2nd day delivery. <br/>The
to be embellished blank  perk items are stocked and deliverable, within a few days after
order placement, directly from their respective manufacturers ... as
well as many distributors. <br/></p>
<p>The money required to acquire those  items has been set aside and is available as needed to fund those purchases. <br/>Since the limited edition caps are produced overseas with a lead
time of 2+ months, I already went ahead and had half of my 288 limited
edition order manufactured. Recently received, they are available for
immediate shipment.</p>
<p>I also obtained small test quantities of my <i>Call Of The Wild</i> <i>Collection </i>items so the products and their packaging could be examined and recently received assurances the deliveries of any orders I place for them will occur within what I specified as an acceptable timeframe.</p>
<p>So shortly after the campaign comes to
an end, pressing, packaging and shipping of the perks will begin.
<br/></p>
<p>Our goal is to
have all of the perks delivered to campaign backers by mid-December. 
</p>
<p>While that schedule is
aggressive and the timing will be tight, I believe it is
achievable.<br/>Because should the campaign prove to be so successful
we will not during the desired timeframe be able to handle all of the
embellishing in-house, I will contract Stahls' Contract Decorating
Fulfillment Center for external assistance. <br/>80 years experience,
a reputation for providing the quickest turnaround times in the
industry and an exclusive supplier to many professional sports
leagues and licensed manufacturers,  the center has been confirmed
ready, willing and able to serve me/Elements Of Style, LLC as a dependable Plan B.</p>
<p>So while unexpected
developments could conceivably result in the failure of some perks to
be delivered in time to be presented as Holiday gifts, there are
essentially no risks or insurmountable challenges likely to prevent
successful completion of the proposed project.</p>

Harlem Children's Zone, Leukemia & Lymphoma Society,
Massachusetts Institute Of Technology, Massachusetts Prostate Cancer

And last but not
least, I will be able to provide students attending local colleges
with opportunities to make money working as part-time press operators
or through their own entrepreneurial endeavors marketing and selling
NYC Wear and Gear's heat press embellished items. 
So please back my project
and help make my proposed purchase of the two heat presses a reality
by selecting a perk at the support/contribution level with which you are
comfortable and then sharing word of this campaign with friends,

 Risks & Challenges
There is no question
as far as feasibility because the heat press equipment in
which I plan to invest is routinely being used by many companies to
embellish goods exactly like those I am offering as
perks. 

Since March when I
visited the Imprinted Sportswear Show (ISS
is the
largest trade
show dedicated
to the decorated apparel industry) in Atlantic City, where I saw live demos of the heat
presses applying to various items of interest designs of different looks
and feels, met with manufacturers/suppliers of garments, equipment  and materials, obtained answers to my
questions regarding heat presses/accessories & heat transfers, and
attended pertinent presentations, I have been communicating with
representatives of the companies I met  and attending
application-specific webinars to ensure that should I encounter
issues I lack the knowledge or skill to address I will know exactly
who to consult or contract for solutions.
The presses, for
which space has already been made available, will be shipping from a Pennsylvania-based sister company of their manufacturer and I have been assured
they keep in stock large quantities of both models as well as any
accessories I might choose to purchase. I will be obtaining my
transfer sheets from a second sister company that specializes in
custom transfers. The presses and the transfers typically ship
the day after receipt of an order with 2nd day delivery. The
to be embellished blank  perk items are stocked and deliverable, within a few days after
order placement, directly from their respective manufacturers ... as
well as many distributors. 
The money required to acquire those  items has been set aside and is available as needed to fund those purchases. Since the limited edition caps are produced overseas with a lead
time of 2+ months, I already went ahead and had half of my 288 limited
edition order manufactured. Recently received, they are available for
immediate shipment.
I also obtained small test quantities of my Call Of The Wild Collection items so the products and their packaging could be examined and recently received assurances the deliveries of any orders I place for them will occur within what I specified as an acceptable timeframe.
So shortly after the campaign comes to
an end, pressing, packaging and shipping of the perks will begin.

Our goal is to
have all of the perks delivered to campaign backers by mid-December. 

While that schedule is
aggressive and the timing will be tight, I believe it is
achievable.Because should the campaign prove to be so successful
we will not during the desired timeframe be able to handle all of the
embellishing in-house, I will contract Stahls' Contract Decorating
Fulfillment Center for external assistance. 80 years experience,
a reputation for providing the quickest turnaround times in the
industry and an exclusive supplier to many professional sports
leagues and licensed manufacturers,  the center has been confirmed
ready, willing and able to serve me/Elements Of Style, LLC as a dependable Plan B.
So while unexpected
developments could conceivably result in the failure of some perks to
be delivered in time to be presented as Holiday gifts, there are
essentially no risks or insurmountable challenges likely to prevent
successful completion of the proposed project.",21.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h2 class=""p1""><strong>Update #3: One week left! New Perk!</strong></h2>
<p>We've come a long way with this campaign, and it's all thanks to you, our loyal supporters. Now there's just one week left and we've nearly reached our second goal. Help us out go with a bang!</p>
<p>We are happy to announce a brand new perk: <strong>Traveler<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong><img alt=""Volante Sling Bag"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://24.media.tumblr.com/d01c2d181eb908641c633cd1df1e9b16/tumblr_mij4hs42z11s1r0vlo1_500.png"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Receive a sling bag printed with the Volante Design logo. The bags, while not produced by Volante Design, feature a design style similar to what you would expect from Volante. 2 practical zipper pockets, a mesh water bottle pouch, and an adjustable strap make this bag excellent for everyday use.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2 class=""p1""><strong>Update #2: What happens now that we've reached our goal?</strong></h2>
<p class=""p2"">$15,000 was just the beginning. That was set as our goal because that is the bare minimum we needed to take this next step. Now that we are there, we can start working toward the fun stuff; the things that will really set us apart from other businesses.</p>
<p class=""p2"">If you've been following the campaign, you already know that we are raising money to be able to purchase software that is optimized for clothing pattern design. You also know that the 15k we've raised so far will fund the basic 2D Computer Assisted Design, or CAD, aspect of the program, and that the next step is some sort of 3D extension to the software. </p>
<p class=""p2"">But what you might not understand yet is <strong>how the 3D software will affect Volante Design.</strong></p>
<h3 class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><strong>Basically, For</strong> Us:<br/><br/></span></h3>
<p>3D rendered prototypes! - Rather than have to go through the process of making a pattern, cutting it out, cutting the fabric, sewing, and so on, we can make a pattern that will be automatically rendered as a 3D model (with fabric physics). This will save us a LOT of time, and allow us to make more new designs.</p>
<p>Real time pattern adjustment! - We'll be able to change the pattern and immediately see a 3D model reflecting those changes.</p>
<p>The two of those combined with the software we can afford now will allow us to change existing patterns much more quickly, speeding up workflow and helping us not waste time drawing on/cutting out more paper.</p>
<h3>Basically, For You:</h3>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><strong><br/></strong>More new designs, faster than we've been able to before!</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Easier to do experimental customization!</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Better, more accurate custom fits!</span></p>
<p class=""p2"">We can be faster overall!</p>
<p class=""p2"">Stronger clothes, thanks to real time stress maps!</p>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<h2 class=""p2"">Want to know more?</h2>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><strong><br/></strong></span>It's quite simple; the extended software will allow us to create 3D virtual prototypes of each of our garments. As a small company, we run into the problem of not having the resources or workers to create new prototypes, because they are too busy working on current orders. With virtual prototyping, we can make tweaks and adjustments and be able to see what difference those changes will make, without having to put a hold on production.</p>
<p class=""p2"">There is a video on the Optitex main page that shows some of the advantages of having the full software package. Be forewarned, the video is done in the cheesiest way possible, but it gets the point across.</p>
<p class=""p2""><a href=""http://www.optitex.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.optitex.com</a></p>
<p class=""p2"">More important than that is how it will affect the <strong>Volante Design customer experience.</strong></p>
<h3 class=""p2"">Imagine this:</h3>
<p class=""p2"">An online store with the capability of showing you what you would actually look like in a particular garment.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Take, for example, the Kenway Jacket. Say you wanted to buy the Kenway, but didn't know which size would fit you best. Optitex is currently working on a system which will be able to be implemented in a webstore that will allow you to input your measurements, and the system will create a 3D avatar that fits those measurements. You would then be able to take your avatar and apply the Kenway to it. If you apply the size Large Kenway to it, the program will simulate how that size jacket would fit you. If it looks like that size isn't right, you can try on a different size.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Essentially what we are talking about is a virtual dressing room. Optitex has a basic mockup of how this might work on their site. Since the dressing room isn't quite ready yet, it does not support clothing sizes or colors yet, but again, it gets the point across.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Take a look at it here: <a href=""http://3dvirtualclothing.optitex.com/#!female-size-38-tattooed/leather-like-low-rise-cigarette-jeans/black-stripes-double-v-tee-double-v-tee?back=2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Virtual Dressing Room Mockup</a></p>
<h3 class=""p2""><strong>And that's just for the webstore! </strong></h3>
<p class=""p2"">We also do a great deal of custom design and creations. With the virtual prototyping, we would be able to give our custom design clients a simulated prototype before cutting fabric, so that adjustments can be made without wasting time and materials.</p>
<h3 class=""p2"">And then there's color choices…</h3>
<p class=""p2"">Volante Design prides itself in offering multiple color options for each of it's garments. The trouble we come to currently is that it can be difficult to visualize a color scheme for a particular jacket without seeing it. Virtual prototyping will enable us to create 3D versions of each of the main color schemes, as well as custom color schemes on the fly. So you'll never have to wonder if a purple and yellow Modern Assassin Armor will actually look good. </p>
<p class=""p2"">It totally would, by the way.</p>
<p class=""p2"">That's it for now. The next goal ['C' above] is set for 25k. When we reach that, there will be another explanation for what comes after it. Keep sharing and helping in any way you can. </p>

<h2>Volante Design: About Us</h2>
<div> </div>
<div>Volante Design is a new, independently owned clothing design company based in Northampton, Massachusetts. It was started a year and a half ago by Enzo Volante; he decided to build a world of fashion where ordinary people could feel extraordinary, and that's been his full time job ever since.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We draw inspiration from the amazing costumes you can find in comic books, video games, movies, anime, and so on to create jackets that are completely suitable for everyday street wear.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As Enzo likes to put it, ""I try to straddle the line between 'ridiculous' and 'awesome,' with the intention of ending up at 'ridiculously awesome.'""<br/><br/>The entire operation is currently run out of a single room in Northampton, with three full time employees (including Enzo). To see the sort of work we do, check out the gallery, or go to our store, <a href=""http://volantedesign.us"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">volantedesign.us</a>, and our <a href=""http://blog.volantedesign.us"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">blog</a>.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We've also been covered in popular online magazines like <a href=""http://kotaku.com/5942603/sweet-mother-of-assassins-creed-iii-i-would-wear-this-jacket-up-and-down-and-everywhere"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kotaku</a> and <a href=""http://fashionablygeek.com/jackets/a-gorgeous-assassins-creed-jacket/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">FashionablyGeek</a>.</div>
<div>
<h3>This sounds cool, what do you need?</h3>
<p>As a small company with few employees, limited workspace, and limited funds, it's hard (impossible) to create excellent jackets for everyone (more than a few at a time) who wants them. It's <em>extra</em> difficult for Enzo to find time to create new redesigns and patterns, because everything is done painstakingly by hand on paper. This takes a <em>lot</em> of time, and time is at a premium for us.</p>
<h3>But, I can't donate time through Paypal.</h3>
<p> This is where you come in! With your donations, Volante Design can take the next giant leap into the world of clothing design. Think about it this way: the Volante Design blog has about 5,500 followers. If 5,000 followers each gave $5, we would raise $25,000, which would cover not only the bare minimum we need, but also enable us to purchase the full software upgrade. What's this about software, you ask?</p>
<p>As a self-taught pattern designer, Enzo creates all his patterns by hand, cutting and splicing pieces of paper together with tape, painstakingly adjusting each edge of the paper to account for seam allowance. And while this method works in the small studio, it is very time consuming, not particularly accurate, and most importantly will not be accepted by a professional manufacturer for mass production. Manufacturers require digitally perfected patterns, which means we would have to scan (or digitize) our hard-copy patterns into a pattern design program, in order to optimize them for production.</p>
<p>There are companies out there that offer digitizing and optimization services which Volante Design could outsource to, but that can take several weeks, and runs the risk of losing valuable design nuances, due to the disconnect from the original creative mind behind the design. Therefore, it would be incredibly valuable for Volante Design to own the software and hardware for itself, so that we can create the best possible product, without having to rely on outside sources.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How much we need, and why:</h3>
<p>First, a list of the prices, and below will be an explanation of what each item is and why it is important.</p>
<p><strong>Pattern Digitizer:</strong> $2,685</p>
<p><strong>Optitex PDS:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2D: $9,700</li>
<li>3D: +$10,000</li>
<li>Animation: +$2,500</li>
</ul>
<p>= Total: $22,300</p>
<p><strong>Plotter/Large Format Printer:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Small/4ft: ~$4,000</li>
<li>Larger/5+ft: ~$14,000</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why exactly is all that necessary, you ask?</h3>
<p>Well, basically, the benefits of owning such pattern design software [PDS] are countless. We will be able to create a pattern, digitize it, and make adjustments, add seam allowance, create standard sizes and make instant custom size variations simply by plugging in a list of measurements. And that's just with the 2D software.</p>
<p>With the 3D software, we would be able to create 3D virtual prototypes, which will streamline the design process, and help minimize the number of sewn prototypes needed before a product is ready to be sold. The most important takeaway is that having the capability to create digital patterns in-house will drastically increase productivity, and reduce the amount of time between releasing new designs.</p>
<p>That's the skinny. Rather than fill this page with long, detailed descriptions of why each part of the software and hardware is important, we've decided to put all of that elsewhere.

<p> </p>
<h3>Ok, so what happens when we surpass our fundraising goal?</h3>
<p>Once we have met our goal, any funds over the required amount for the full software package will go towards producing more garments for Express orders, as well as designing completely new styles. Every single dollar helps, and we will be eternally grateful for your contribution.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>What sort of perks are we offering for your contributions?</h3>
<p>No matter how much you can give, we want to show you that we appreciate your help.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Fan - $5:</strong> For five dollars, Enzo will give you a high five the first time you meet. Fist bumps are available as an alternative.</li>
<li>
<strong>Minstrel - $25: </strong>Almost completely unrelated to Volante Design, but here's an example of what sort of thing to expect: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se4Aek5X4CM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se4Aek5X4CM</a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Artist - $50:</strong> Receive a high quality print of your favorite Volante Design illustration. When the illustrations were originally posted, they did not have backgrounds, these will be added to make the artwork more interesting for print.</li>
<li>
<strong>VIP - $100:</strong> Once we have the ability to create patterns more quickly, we will be taking votes regularly as to which design should be developed next. Largely these votes will be hosted on the official <a href=""blog.volantedesign.us"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""blog"">blog</a>, but once the general vote has narrowed it down, I will put the final decision to the VIP board through email. As a VIP member, you will be able to give reasons for your choice, and offer feedback. Enzo will read every response, and take them into consideration before choosing.</li>
<li>
<strong>We Listen To You - $150:</strong> Enzo will do an entirely new illustration of the design of your choice. He will take your initial ideas into consideration, and work one on one to come up with a brand new design with you. This design may not become immediately available, but will be developed at a future date.</li>
<li>
<strong>Messenger - $300:</strong> This perk refers to a completely new design from Volante: a messenger bag. The design for this bag has not yet been finalized, but it will be based on, and inspired by, the bag Desmond wears in the Assassin's Creed series. For reference, this bag can be seen here: <a href=""http://volanteinspiration.tumblr.com/post/38849725735"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://volanteinspiration.tumblr.com/post/38849725735</a>. More information will be posted as it is available.</li>
<li>
<strong>Benefactor/Patron/Medici - $1k/$5k/$10k: </strong>With these perks, you will be able to propose your own wishes for a custom piece of clothing, and have it made just for you. You will take part in the design process, and be able to make sure you get the exact garment you want. The more you contribute, the more complex your design can be, or the better the materials used can be. If we raise enough for the 3D software, you will be able to see what the design will look like on you before the final piece is made, and make final adjustments. The Exclusive Plan refers to the amount of time before your design is made available for order to the public. So a 6 Month plan means for 6 months after the date you receive your garment, you will be only person who owns a garment of that design.</li>

<h3>And that’s all there is to it.</h3></div>","Update #3: One week left! New Perk!
We've come a long way with this campaign, and it's all thanks to you, our loyal supporters. Now there's just one week left and we've nearly reached our second goal. Help us out go with a bang!
We are happy to announce a brand new perk: Traveler

 
Receive a sling bag printed with the Volante Design logo. The bags, while not produced by Volante Design, feature a design style similar to what you would expect from Volante. 2 practical zipper pockets, a mesh water bottle pouch, and an adjustable strap make this bag excellent for everyday use.
 
Update #2: What happens now that we've reached our goal?
$15,000 was just the beginning. That was set as our goal because that is the bare minimum we needed to take this next step. Now that we are there, we can start working toward the fun stuff; the things that will really set us apart from other businesses.
If you've been following the campaign, you already know that we are raising money to be able to purchase software that is optimized for clothing pattern design. You also know that the 15k we've raised so far will fund the basic 2D Computer Assisted Design, or CAD, aspect of the program, and that the next step is some sort of 3D extension to the software. 
But what you might not understand yet is how the 3D software will affect Volante Design.
Basically, For Us:
3D rendered prototypes! - Rather than have to go through the process of making a pattern, cutting it out, cutting the fabric, sewing, and so on, we can make a pattern that will be automatically rendered as a 3D model (with fabric physics). This will save us a LOT of time, and allow us to make more new designs.
Real time pattern adjustment! - We'll be able to change the pattern and immediately see a 3D model reflecting those changes.
The two of those combined with the software we can afford now will allow us to change existing patterns much more quickly, speeding up workflow and helping us not waste time drawing on/cutting out more paper.
Basically, For You:
More new designs, faster than we've been able to before!
Easier to do experimental customization!
Better, more accurate custom fits!
We can be faster overall!
Stronger clothes, thanks to real time stress maps!
 
Want to know more?
It's quite simple; the extended software will allow us to create 3D virtual prototypes of each of our garments. As a small company, we run into the problem of not having the resources or workers to create new prototypes, because they are too busy working on current orders. With virtual prototyping, we can make tweaks and adjustments and be able to see what difference those changes will make, without having to put a hold on production.
There is a video on the Optitex main page that shows some of the advantages of having the full software package. Be forewarned, the video is done in the cheesiest way possible, but it gets the point across.
www.optitex.com
More important than that is how it will affect the Volante Design customer experience.
Imagine this:
An online store with the capability of showing you what you would actually look like in a particular garment.
Take, for example, the Kenway Jacket. Say you wanted to buy the Kenway, but didn't know which size would fit you best. Optitex is currently working on a system which will be able to be implemented in a webstore that will allow you to input your measurements, and the system will create a 3D avatar that fits those measurements. You would then be able to take your avatar and apply the Kenway to it. If you apply the size Large Kenway to it, the program will simulate how that size jacket would fit you. If it looks like that size isn't right, you can try on a different size.
Essentially what we are talking about is a virtual dressing room. Optitex has a basic mockup of how this might work on their site. Since the dressing room isn't quite ready yet, it does not support clothing sizes or colors yet, but again, it gets the point across.
Take a look at it here: Virtual Dressing Room Mockup
And that's just for the webstore! 
We also do a great deal of custom design and creations. With the virtual prototyping, we would be able to give our custom design clients a simulated prototype before cutting fabric, so that adjustments can be made without wasting time and materials.
And then there's color choices…
Volante Design prides itself in offering multiple color options for each of it's garments. The trouble we come to currently is that it can be difficult to visualize a color scheme for a particular jacket without seeing it. Virtual prototyping will enable us to create 3D versions of each of the main color schemes, as well as custom color schemes on the fly. So you'll never have to wonder if a purple and yellow Modern Assassin Armor will actually look good. 
It totally would, by the way.
That's it for now. The next goal ['C' above] is set for 25k. When we reach that, there will be another explanation for what comes after it. Keep sharing and helping in any way you can. 
Update #1: New Perk Unlocked!

Volante Assassin
You folks are amazing! In less than a week, we hit 15k, which was our ""goal,"" but there’s still a long way to go before we’re done. Here’s a new perk, a t-shirt specially designed for the Volante Assassins out there who want to show their support, even when it’s too warm for a jacket. Some info about the shirt:

4.1 oz. polyester jersey on front, 5.4 oz. polyester twill on back
Wicking and antimicrobial fabric
Sporty contrast stitched raglan sleeves
""C"" logo on left sleeve
 
Volante Design: About Us
 
Volante Design is a new, independently owned clothing design company based in Northampton, Massachusetts. It was started a year and a half ago by Enzo Volante; he decided to build a world of fashion where ordinary people could feel extraordinary, and that's been his full time job ever since.
 
We draw inspiration from the amazing costumes you can find in comic books, video games, movies, anime, and so on to create jackets that are completely suitable for everyday street wear.
 
As Enzo likes to put it, ""I try to straddle the line between 'ridiculous' and 'awesome,' with the intention of ending up at 'ridiculously awesome.'""The entire operation is currently run out of a single room in Northampton, with three full time employees (including Enzo). To see the sort of work we do, check out the gallery, or go to our store, volantedesign.us, and our blog.
 
We've also been covered in popular online magazines like Kotaku and FashionablyGeek.

This sounds cool, what do you need?
As a small company with few employees, limited workspace, and limited funds, it's hard (impossible) to create excellent jackets for everyone (more than a few at a time) who wants them. It's extra difficult for Enzo to find time to create new redesigns and patterns, because everything is done painstakingly by hand on paper. This takes a lot of time, and time is at a premium for us.
But, I can't donate time through Paypal.
 This is where you come in! With your donations, Volante Design can take the next giant leap into the world of clothing design. Think about it this way: the Volante Design blog has about 5,500 followers. If 5,000 followers each gave $5, we would raise $25,000, which would cover not only the bare minimum we need, but also enable us to purchase the full software upgrade. What's this about software, you ask?
As a self-taught pattern designer, Enzo creates all his patterns by hand, cutting and splicing pieces of paper together with tape, painstakingly adjusting each edge of the paper to account for seam allowance. And while this method works in the small studio, it is very time consuming, not particularly accurate, and most importantly will not be accepted by a professional manufacturer for mass production. Manufacturers require digitally perfected patterns, which means we would have to scan (or digitize) our hard-copy patterns into a pattern design program, in order to optimize them for production.
There are companies out there that offer digitizing and optimization services which Volante Design could outsource to, but that can take several weeks, and runs the risk of losing valuable design nuances, due to the disconnect from the original creative mind behind the design. Therefore, it would be incredibly valuable for Volante Design to own the software and hardware for itself, so that we can create the best possible product, without having to rely on outside sources.
 
How much we need, and why:
First, a list of the prices, and below will be an explanation of what each item is and why it is important.
Pattern Digitizer: $2,685
Optitex PDS:

2D: $9,700
3D: +$10,000
Animation: +$2,500

= Total: $22,300
Plotter/Large Format Printer:

Small/4ft: ~$4,000
Larger/5+ft: ~$14,000

 
Why exactly is all that necessary, you ask?
Well, basically, the benefits of owning such pattern design software [PDS] are countless. We will be able to create a pattern, digitize it, and make adjustments, add seam allowance, create standard sizes and make instant custom size variations simply by plugging in a list of measurements. And that's just with the 2D software.
With the 3D software, we would be able to create 3D virtual prototypes, which will streamline the design process, and help minimize the number of sewn prototypes needed before a product is ready to be sold. The most important takeaway is that having the capability to create digital patterns in-house will drastically increase productivity, and reduce the amount of time between releasing new designs.
That's the skinny. Rather than fill this page with long, detailed descriptions of why each part of the software and hardware is important, we've decided to put all of that elsewhere. Click this link to read on: http://blog.volantedesign.us/post/39608298933
 
Ok, so what happens when we surpass our fundraising goal?
Once we have met our goal, any funds over the required amount for the full software package will go towards producing more garments for Express orders, as well as designing completely new styles. Every single dollar helps, and we will be eternally grateful for your contribution.


 
What sort of perks are we offering for your contributions?
No matter how much you can give, we want to show you that we appreciate your help.


Fan - $5: For five dollars, Enzo will give you a high five the first time you meet. Fist bumps are available as an alternative.

Minstrel - $25: Almost completely unrelated to Volante Design, but here's an example of what sort of thing to expect: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se4Aek5X4CM


Artist - $50: Receive a high quality print of your favorite Volante Design illustration. When the illustrations were originally posted, they did not have backgrounds, these will be added to make the artwork more interesting for print.

VIP - $100: Once we have the ability to create patterns more quickly, we will be taking votes regularly as to which design should be developed next. Largely these votes will be hosted on the official blog, but once the general vote has narrowed it down, I will put the final decision to the VIP board through email. As a VIP member, you will be able to give reasons for your choice, and offer feedback. Enzo will read every response, and take them into consideration before choosing.

We Listen To You - $150: Enzo will do an entirely new illustration of the design of your choice. He will take your initial ideas into consideration, and work one on one to come up with a brand new design with you. This design may not become immediately available, but will be developed at a future date.

Messenger - $300: This perk refers to a completely new design from Volante: a messenger bag. The design for this bag has not yet been finalized, but it will be based on, and inspired by, the bag Desmond wears in the Assassin's Creed series. For reference, this bag can be seen here: http://volanteinspiration.tumblr.com/post/38849725735. More information will be posted as it is available.

Benefactor/Patron/Medici - $1k/$5k/$10k: With these perks, you will be able to propose your own wishes for a custom piece of clothing, and have it made just for you. You will take part in the design process, and be able to make sure you get the exact garment you want. The more you contribute, the more complex your design can be, or the better the materials used can be. If we raise enough for the 3D software, you will be able to see what the design will look like on you before the final piece is made, and make final adjustments. The Exclusive Plan refers to the amount of time before your design is made available for order to the public. So a 6 Month plan means for 6 months after the date you receive your garment, you will be only person who owns a garment of that design.

VIP Prime w/Patron/Medici: You have shown massive support for Volante Design, and deserve something special. VIP Prime status is undefined as yet, and will be discussed ona case-by-case basis, and will depend on what you want to be a part of in regards to the future of the business.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.geeklingdesigns.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Geekling Designs</a> was created in 2009 by two geeks who wanted some cool clothes for their daughter.  After noticing a rather lacklustre selection of witty and geeky designs for the pre-walking crowd, Geekling Designs was born.</p>

A Little Bit about LéLé B
Born from our anthem ""Love Everybody Love Every Body!!"" At LéLé B we believe that every girl should love herself, the body she lives in, and feel authentic in every way possible. All shapes, sizes, and spirits please come join us. Our shared journey starts here.
Started as the brain child of award winning beauty product developer Kym Wechsler, She wanted to do more then just create another must have beauty product. Over the past three years she has worked to develop this lifestyle beauty brand. By focusing on all different ways of spreading the message ""Love Everybody Love Every Body!!"" we have arrived at the collection of 17 beauty products as well as all the brand messaging accessories. Where do young women turn to for love and acceptance? From now on they can turn here. We will have live weekly Chat sessions with Dr. Victoria who will teach us all better ways to Love Our Bodies and Love Each Other. 
We are starting a revolution, and we are so excited to have you join us! Together we will change the way young women see themselves and each other.
Thanks to each of you!!!!! We will be using the funds raised here to purchase all of the LéLé B Brand Accessories and to create an awesome webite where we will sell products that will help spread the LéLé B ""Love Everybody Love Every Body!!"" and our anthem.


   
B Whoever You Can B and Give Whatever You Can
While we have the funds to make the beauty products, we need your help to build the branding apparel and accessories portion of LéLé B. Because we know that this is the most powerful way to spread the message. Although we have won many awards in the beauty industry, the rest is all pretty new for us. So we've teamed up with some pretty cool companies (Chico Bag to make our 99% private labeled recyled bags, Alternative Apparel for all our clothing including our beanies and scarves). What else do you think we need to spread the word??? Please share with us your insight. How do we become better, stronger, and more creative? Please let us know at social@luvleleb.com 
 
B Impactful


Each small step we take will make a difference. Spreading the word with our bumper stickers helps pass the love along to the car behind you. Our Message-band bracelets are a friendly reminder to love ourselves and the one right next to us. Wear a LéLé B attitude T-shirt and your favorite It's The Balm fragrance. When people tell you how great you smell just tell them, ""Thank you! I'm wearing my favorite LéLé B It's The Balm fragrance. I'm The Balm and so are you!"" ;)

Perfecting the Pocketsquare...


Pocketsquare Perfection securely locks your pocketsquare in place, so no more pinning, stuffing, or having to wear cardboard contraptions in your suit or jacket pockets.  


The Device



Our mission for this campaign is to raise the funding goal we set and inevitably start a ""Pocketsquare Movement"" in promoting this new accessory for the modern gentleman.  We have formulated our design concept and after creating and testing various prototypes, we came up with a good CAD model to began to sample with several manufacturers.   Then we finally narrowed it down to our succinct, and sleek design pictured below.  We plan to get this

the campaign.  My team and I have worked on the project extensively 
going on two years and Indiegogo will be the platform we use to begin 
this movement.  



With your help, we plan to meet our suppliers and manufacturers minimum orders to ultimately make this affordable leather product available for all who wear suits, sport-coats, and blazers.  We want to be able to meet the demands of our customers but most important we want to keep this product affordable and made in America.Our
 niche in the fashion industry is that we
teach so many different ways to fold with use of the device via our 
color pictorials included on the packaging, our 1-minute
tutorial videos for each fold, and our free app for smart devices that we are in the process of designing.  In addition we will have customer rewards and discounts online, as well as a current style and fashion blog dedicated to Men's fashion.  With the funds 
raised we basically want to make our website a one-stop-shop for all 
your pocketsquare needs.  


The Classic Mad Men Fold...
The product is great for everyday use, work, business casual, church, formals, weddings, black-tie events, and more. 


What started out of necessity has turned into a passion. Fashion is important to all men and wearing a pocketsquare is
simply one of the easiest ways to elevate your style.  Like most Men we strive on
“Machismo “ and set the standards through our expression in the way we
dress.  As true fashion aficionados, we strive for that classic look, but
sometimes we choose to go with a little additional flair. 


For events such as formals and weddings, it is a must-have.  It provides that consistent and uniform look for all groomsmen and just men in general.


What We Need & What You GetOur manufacturer said that since the holiday season is upon us we have a
 6-week lead-time for manufacturing.  That means that we have to be as 
quick as possible.  We have secured a credit source so that as soon we 
hit our Indiegogo goal we can start production, cutting down the time 
between the end of our Indiegogo campaign, and the time everyone gets their packaged devices.  We want to make sure everyone has plenty of time to get 
everything ready and delivered for the holidays. 
Included
 in the the device is a 100%silk, handwoven, starter pocketsquare. 
Contingent upon the pledge option, you can get either the black or white
 square
In addition to its fine build and quality craftmanship, these devices are truly unique and provide an answer to an age-old problem men have faced since the common suit and accessories evolved.  Each unit has a very special and unique lining with different patterns and designs ideally delineating it into a special accessory in its own right.


With the various reward options and all of the customization available, ideally all you need is just one device.  However, you can have a few just like the average man has multiple cufflinks and tie-clips.    Even tho it is hidden discreetly within the pocket, it is still a great conversational piece in manliness. 

The Impact

TIES FOR TEENS is our youth initiative we have started in which through donations of either new or older ties and bow-ties, we will collect them via an on-going yearly drive and then in turn donate them to male adolescents at various schools in the greater Dallas and Nashville communities.  With that being stated we will enlist volunteers in the community to come in during a particular program setup thru the schools and administration to teach young men about style, and fashion, but more importantly, ""how to tie a tie""!We teach sound, fundamental principles through our quick seminars simply about professionalism, how to shake hands, preparation for their first interviews, and just basic essentials important in the development of male adolescents.  
A small portion of our proceeds (5%) will go toward this worthy cause. 
 




Pocketsquare Perfection is an ideal birthday, holiday, 
special occasion, or even Christmas gift for all Sons, Fathers, 
Brothers, Uncles, and Grandfathers...all Men and Women who choose to elevate 
their style to the next level and simply ""Dress how one wants to be addressed"". 



Its sleek design will not bulge but allows you to fashion your square however you like to.  You even can wear the device and square with a vest with a pocket and even a buttoned-down collared shirt.  

We urge you to support this project so that you can truly achieve your own Pocketsquare Perfection and take your fashion and style to the next level.



Our team has done its best to mitigate the risks and challenges for this project.
We have a working prototype and can proudly state that the devices are outstanding.  Over the past year we have done extensive research and allowed a few people from within to test out the devices and now we are ready to launch this brand and first product to the world.  
Having worked with our manufacturer over this past year and seeing the quality work and craftmanship, we can vouch for their quality and reliability.  We are trying to adhere to our production schedule and are confident in our suppliers and vendors for both the inputs and manufacturing to ultimately get you Pocketsquare Perfection after a successful campaign.  
  

We will release a smaller device custom made for a women and children later this fall (the p2 mini 2.0).  In addition to that, we will carry our own line of pocketsquares, but first Indiegogo lets get the device into the hands of all men, all women, all kids...all people who wear suits and blazers.  Now come on guys, lets make Pocketsquare Perfection a brand for the ages.

That's why, I have developed the PERFECT all day short.OUR SHORTS ARE MORE THAN REGULAR COTTON SHORTSOur 100% Cotton Twill, ""Morrison"" Short, dries faster than regular cotton shorts. The Morrison short is the perfect all day, anywhere short. Take a bike ride, hike, play golf, walk around town.I have designed and engineered a 100% cotton short that reacts like a moisture wicking synthetic fiber. I set out to remake the classic khaki short using modern day technology. Don't you think it is time to bring your wardrobe into the 21st century?I searched the market for a 100% cotton short that would react like a synthetic. I quickly realized, I would need to make the material from scratch.Supporting Our Project  Thank you for supporting our project and giving me the chance to bring my shorts to market. I appreciate your generosity!  I need to raise $10,000!  This will be used to create the fabric, make production samples, and complete the first full production run---the money is not for salaries.How far is Ben Kona in the development and production process? 
I have made several prototypes to ensure the right size, shape, and fit.
The supply chain is all set up. From the fabric to the final product.
I have tested the fabric in and out of the water.
 If I can raise over $100,000, I will begin developing a line of women’s shorts/pants.How can you help make this project happen? Here are several ways:

Please CC us in the email at info@benkona.com  What are most of the moisture wicking shorts made out of today?Currently most shorts on the market, which claim to be moisture wicking are produced from petrochemicals. Petrochemicals are chemicals made from crude oil and natural gas. The chief fibers manufactured from petrochemicals include nylon, polyester, acrylic, and olefin.Will they shrink?The fabric is 100% cotton and over the next few years may minimally after being routinely washed. Your shorts should fit you for years to come, as long as you stay the same size.Any special washing or drying instructions?As far as washing - wash in cold water, gentle cycle with like colors, only non-chlorine bleach if needed.Dryer - REALLY IMPORTANT - Do Not Use DRYER SHEETS with our fabric.
