We believe in everyone’s right to access healthy, nutritious food no matter the circumstance.  Grow Calgary is a non-profit, volunteer-run, donation-driven, community urban farm and food access program. All of the produce planted, grown, and harvested by our volunteers is donated to the Calgary Interfaith Food Bank for distribution to in-need families and various community organizations. 
Our efforts are driven entirely by generous donations and the efforts of our beloved volunteers.  That’s where we’re hoping you come in.  
In 2013, we added Calgary's freshest produce to 2,000 food hampers; in 2014 that number grew to 12,000.   We need your help to expand our growing season and to increase our harvest in 2015. Our goal this year is to supplement 36,000 food hampers with fresh, organic vegetables!
What we really need to get to our goal is donations to purchase:



More locally-produced seeds


Materials to construct greenhouses (greenhouses allow us to extend our growing season significantly)


Materials to improve irrigation (did we mention, we have no running water on the farm?)


We also need materials to continue to develop our pollination, seed-saving, and composting programs and to increase our outreach to the community.
There are more ways you can help!



Like us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter to keep up to date with planting and harvesting season.  We’re always looking for more volunteers: volunteer@growcalgary.ca


Share this fundraiser with your friends and family to help raise awareness for Grow Calgary and to generate interest in similar projects throughout the country. 


 Make a material donation (equipment, signage, water storage etc.) or form a partnership.  If you are interested in making a material donation or interested in forming a partnership, please contact: paul@growcalgary.ca  


Nothing is too small.  We appreciate every bit of help!

<p>Founded in 2011, Muir Ranch provides direct hands-on job training for our low-income student population as farm hands, irrigation techs, florists, caterers and customer service managers. The ranch in Pasadena at John Muir High School is a living classroom and startup business laboratory that provides our community with direct access to healthy, organic produce through our farm and our network of California farmers from San Diego to Santa Barbara county. Our main social enterprise, our farm box CSA, is poised to grow to 200 subscribers in 2015. Every 10 clients provides one part-time student job. We need your help to fill our year-round, weekly fruit and vegetable box orders with our very own aquaponically grown leafy greens.  </p>

<h3>Invest in Muir Ranch</h3>
<div>
<p>We need your help to install and maintain a fully functioning, year-round aquaponics system. Why? 1. Because it's too hot in Pasadena to grow and harvest lettuce from March to November <i>in the dirt</i> . 2. Drought. Aquaponics systems only use 10% of the water used by traditional, in-ground dirt farming methods. 3. You get fish. Aquaponics systems are closed-loop and fish are used to feed the plants (yep, they go poo). </p>
<p>We have great technical advisors, space on our 50 acre campus and a built-in customer base, our CSA clients (every restaurant in Pasadena, for starters). </p>
<p>Muir Ranch is very, very special. It's a working business at a high poverty high school in Northwest Pasadena, a food desert as classified by the USDA. It's not just a business but a farm biz that sits at the insection of food, sustainability, class and education. Our kids learn by doing and while they are boxing CSA they development life-long job skills and kale habits. It's a win/win!</p>

</h3>
<p>Many mornings when I would awake, I’d find my six-year-old
daughter’s nails and toes polished to a tee. They would literally look like she
had gone to the nail salon. This didn’t happen once, but dozens of times. She
really liked having her nails painted and did not wait for me to do them.</p>
<p>Despite how beautiful they looked, I always wondered if
the nail polish was safe for her. Well, it wasn’t.</p>
<p>Now at eight, she wants to go to the salon to have her
nails and toes done regularly. In August 2013, I made it my mission to create a
safe, toxin-free nail polish line that could be enjoyed by girls all over the
world.</p>
<p>Why did I take on this project?</p>
<p>I could not understand why my daughter was showing signs
of puberty at such an early age. After doing some research, I found that
scientists believe that many of the chemicals found in cosmetics, including
nail polish, are contributing factors.</p>
<p>With Jungle Polish, there is no need to worry about these
toxins and unpleasant odors. Jungle Polish is made from safe natural ingredients and non-toxic colorants.</p>
<p>Our pledge is to raise awareness about the hidden dangers
of traditional nail polish. Girls that use Jungle Polish can have elegant nails
while staying away from harmful toxins.</p>
<p>We’re giving $1 from each bottle of Jungle Polish sold to
organizations that help children in need.</p>

<div><br/></div>
<div>Now, I’m feeling the call to expand my practice, include more people and offer a variety of affordable group classes for adults and children alike, live and online. The time has come for me to move my practice from my apartment into a commercial space. That's where your help comes in.<h1><br/></h1>
<h1>The Vision</h1>
<b>
Introducing Purple Buddha:</b> A gathering place for people of all ages who wish to expand their consciousness in a nurturing, healing environment that is open to everyone!

With your support, I plan to invite local healers and yogis to join me in offering classes, workshops and private sessions around the clock to audiences both global and local (glocal). </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>These are a few of the topics we will explore:</div>

<div>Your support will allow me to make an even greater impact on our community and our world.

One of the biggest additions I’m called to offer are classes for kids. As a mother and former school teacher, I know how greatly our children benefit from understanding their own energy and the energy of others. Imagine if they knew how to ground and heal themselves! I can teach them that.</div>
<div><br/></div>

<li>$2000: Live streaming equipment to broadcast our live events and classes around the world</li>

We want to keep it on a grass roots level, just as my brother did.  Not the ""big guys"", just the ""little guys""!  By the way, that's a picture of Pepper - our Lab/German Short Hair and new mascot!  
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>We are seeking $15,000 to start operations and run our first raffle.  We have been a registered 501(C)3 charity for 5 years -- why is that important?  A charity must be registered for 5 years before they are allowed to run a raffle without a larger partner!  Now, in our 6th year, we are ready to begin running raffles!  100% of net proceeds will be donated to grass roots operations helping kids with drug addictions.  Funds raised in this campaign would be used to complete website development (Est~$5,000), first raffle marketing expenses (Est~$10,000), and office setup/rent/legal expenses (Est~$5,000).  Raffles will have a grand prize of $250,000 with 10 additional winners of $15,000.<br/><ul>
<li>IF we do not reach our goal, funds raised will be donated to A Man in Recovery Foundation. </li>
<li>You can participate in the raffles and maybe win prizes, but more importantly, you can help us help the ""little guys"" who tend to get overlooked. <br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>One ""big name"" potential partner we spoke with suggested we would be a failure if we didn't sell all our tickets in the first raffle -- we responded that funds/prizes would be prorated based on tickets sold, so any incremental monies used to help a drug addicted child would be worth the effort.  They didn't get it, they were just worried about their image.... These people were from a large drug counseling program -- they were too big to appreciate small donations.  We want to donate to a series of small organizations who would appreciate any donation whatsoever.  Our target is to apply funds to where the ""rubber meets the road"" in small grass roots operations that really need any support they can get!<br/>Please help us reach out and affect the lives of many in need.  Let's help the
 high school kid who is starting to get addicted to drugs, and go down the wrong path.  We are ready to go
 all in, if you are.  Tell all your friends and ask them to donate, no matter how small, it still counts!<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>As with any venture, there are risks!  We have an executive team of seasoned business people who have launched and completed many projects with great results.  With raffles, it's all about the marketing - reach and frequency.  We plan to sell 25,000 tickets in our first raffle....but what if we only sell 5,000 tickets? We would still raise $250,000 - half of which would go toward prizes, and the other half to charity -- we STILL have funds to disburse to various charities -- funds they didn't have before we donated! Then we learn and make improvements for the next raffle,  Our team has been researching the logistics, legal issues and marketing obstacles for over 5 years.  So now we are in year 6 and we've had plenty of time to plan -- now it's time to execute and run successful raffles to raise funds for charity.  Let's help these kids before they get too far down the road to destruction and in many cases death.  Somebody stepped in and helped my kid and probably saved his life - now let's pay that forward and help other kids too.<br/><br/>

Coming to Lynchburg for college for psychology and professional counseling, I always thought that I would leave as soon as I got my degree, but I saw an opportunity to add to this community in a very real way. I've been playing with the idea of doing <i>The Listening</i> for a few years now. And I've done a lot so far, but now is the time to do so much more. I can NOT do it alone.</p>
<p><i><br/></i></p>
<p><i>The Listening</i> exists to create a safe environment
that inspires young, passionate artists and creatives through a diverse array
of performing arts (dance, music, creative writing, drama) to positively impact
the local community towards unity in creative diversity. <i>The Listening</i> challenges artists, as well as the community, to network with different artists
and individuals while unlocking the therapeutic and cathartic possibilities of
diverse creativity. The vision of <i>The Listening</i> is to expose the youth to the
world of performing arts and art appreciation, challenge the culture of apathy
and illiteracy, discover a fresh sense of self-worth, and impact the world
around them.<br/></p>

<p>My motivation is simply this: Lynchburg is a
unique place, with a growing music and creative scene. The downtown area is experiencing
a renaissance of sorts, while each of the universities within the city
(Randolph College, Liberty University, Lynchburg College, Virginia University of Lynchburg) has been growing in
their respective rights. My vantage point presents the city as growing, but
fundamentally incongruent when it comes to diversity and the arts. I think
there is a capacity for Lynchburg to not only grow in unity, but also grow in
diversity and classic/modern artistic expression, now, but for generations to come.</p>

Coming to Lynchburg for college for psychology and professional counseling, I always thought that I would leave as soon as I got my degree, but I saw an opportunity to add to this community in a very real way. I've been playing with the idea of doing The Listening for a few years now. And I've done a lot so far, but now is the time to do so much more. I can NOT do it alone.

The Listening exists to create a safe environment
that inspires young, passionate artists and creatives through a diverse array
of performing arts (dance, music, creative writing, drama) to positively impact
the local community towards unity in creative diversity. The Listening challenges artists, as well as the community, to network with different artists
and individuals while unlocking the therapeutic and cathartic possibilities of
diverse creativity. The vision of The Listening is to expose the youth to the
world of performing arts and art appreciation, challenge the culture of apathy
and illiteracy, discover a fresh sense of self-worth, and impact the world
around them.

My motivation is simply this: Lynchburg is a
unique place, with a growing music and creative scene. The downtown area is experiencing
a renaissance of sorts, while each of the universities within the city
(Randolph College, Liberty University, Lynchburg College, Virginia University of Lynchburg) has been growing in
their respective rights. My vantage point presents the city as growing, but
fundamentally incongruent when it comes to diversity and the arts. I think
there is a capacity for Lynchburg to not only grow in unity, but also grow in
diversity and classic/modern artistic expression, now, but for generations to come.
I need your help.   
What We Need & What You Get If my pockets were deep enough, a lot would have been done by now. Before it can be accomplished, The Listening needs to be recognized as an actual entity and become incorporated. To become incorporated, there's a fee. To file for 501 (c)(3) tax-exempt status, there's a fee. To hold quarterly events, featuring local and national talents, there's a fee.

With $2,000, The Listening an established non-profit organization dedicated to inspiring and engaging the community in diverse arts appreciation and mentoring services, while presenting itself as a place to be who you are.

My wife Lisa Blais and I are opening a tourism business in Italy called Amazing Abruzzo Tours in May 2016. We're running this Indiegogo campaign to kick-start our business.</p><p>We'd love for you to be part of our adventure, so we're offering the great deals on trips to Italy you see on the right.</p><p>We're Canadians from Ottawa, Ontario, in our 40s who've grown tired of the rat race. We bought a historic villa in Italy, and we're ditching our careers to give people authentic Italian experiences in the breathtaking Abruzzo region, 90 minutes east of Rome. Get one of our packages, and you'll see exactly what we mean!<br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1168009/files/20150122160906-abruzzo-map.gif?1421971746"" src="""" style=""width: 600px; height: 441px;""/></p><p>Lisa's grandfather came to Canada from Abruzzo. It's an incredibly beautiful yet largely undiscovered place filled with interesting things to do and see. There are great wineries and food, mountains, beaches, quaint villages, festivals, hiking, biking, Roman ruins, castles and fabulous people who love having a good time.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1150308/files/20150114172404-File0091.JPG?1421285044"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We adore Abruzzo, and we are going to showcase it to the world through boutique, all-inclusive  packages and do-it-yourself tours of the area. Details of these products are below and pictures of the area are in the gallery. With us, you will get an authentic Italian experience.</p><p>We're a family and LGBT friendly company. All are welcome at Amazing Abruzzo Tours.</p><p>If you have any questions about this campaign, our company or our products, email us at amazingabruzzotours@gmail.com and we'll quickly get back to you.</p><h4>Project Progress</h4>We've purchased and paid for a five-bedroom, six-bathroom Villa for our company's home base. Villa d'Abruzzo's interior renovations are mostly done - new kitchen, heating, cooling, plumbing, electrical, etc. The place is fantastic. It oozes Italy.<div>

<p>We didn't take proper marketing shots of the Villa the last time we were there, but if you check out the pictures in the gallery, you'll get a great sense of the place.</p>

<div>Our business plan, market research, competitive analysis, operating plan and start-up plan are complete. Our marketing plan is done and will launch in the coming months. Our website is under construction, and all other final tasks are under way.</div>
<p><b>What We Need</b><br/></p>
<p>Exterior works including a large terrace, a pool and landscape work are proceeding this summer. We also have start-up and fit-up costs. Through a combination of our savings and some debt, we have these works covered, but we'd love to launch our business with no debt, so we're looking to raise $150,000.</p>

<p>We're confident that we will reach our goal. But, if we don't, all funds from this campaign will still  go to the project. We will then supplement the balance with traditional funding, which we have secured, but not accessed.</p>
<p><b>What you get by contributing</b></p>
<p>Contributions will get you updates through various platforms. There's also neat Amazing Abruzzo swag like cheeseboards and key chains and framed pictures of the area.</p>
<p>The best perks are coupons and packages that will see you come to Italy, stay at Villa d'Abruzzo and enjoy food, wine, sights and much fun to be had with Amazing Abruzzo Tours.</p>

<p>If this is your first time to Italy, combine a seven-day package at Villa d'Abruzzo with a tour of Venice, Rome and Florence. A stay with us after a few days in these larger centres is a perfect introduction to ""la dolce vita""!</p>
<p><span>If you are returning to Italy, a week with Amazing Abruzzo Tours will show you an authentic side of the country tourists rarely get to experience.</span></p>
<p><span>We can accommodate up to eight people based on double occupancy for tours, and, as you can see further down on the right, our travel discounts are progressive, so the more people you book, the cheaper it is per person.</span></p>
<p>We can also customize tour options and bookings. If you want to focus on wine and food, we will build you a package. If you want to book for 10 days or rent the whole villa for a month for a family gathering, we can do that too. If you don't see what you need in the perk list, contact us and we'll work something out together.</p></span><p></p>
<h4></h4>
<h4>The Impact</h4>
<p>A contribution to the success of this campaign will have several impacts.</p>
<p>We have secured financing to complete our project, but a successful Indiegogo campaign will mean no borrowing. It will also allow us to relocate from Canada to Italy quickly to take care of the final details.</p>
<p>For the town of Torre de'Passeri where Villa d'Abruzzo is located, it will mean economic development because we will be using all local supplies and services including contractors, construction products and labour, wineries, and foods.</p>
<p>For Abruzzo, it means exposure. Italians love vacationing there, but even though it's only slightly off the beaten track, it remains largely undiscovered by foreign tourists.</p>
<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<p>Starting a company in a new country and speaking your third language hasn't been easy, but Lisa and I are up to the challenge. I'm studying Italian, business planning and operations management. Lisa is taking an online marketing course.</p>
<p>We've assembled a great team in Italy and Canada, including a project manager, legal and business agents, a great architect, a dedicated contractor, several trusted advisers, and marketing experts. We're also getting good support from local officials in Torre de'Passeri.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>There are ways you can help this campaign besides financially.</p>
<p>You can spread the word in your network, like us on Facebook, or best of all forward a link to this campaign to people you think might be interested. Anything you can do to help us reach a bigger audience, including using the Indiegogo share tools, would be much appreciated.</p>
<p><b>Media</b></p>

</div></div>","Thanks for checking out our Indiegogo campaign site. It was a great success. The campaign is closed, but all the information here is still valid. If you want to book a trip or have questions, go to http://amazingabruzzotours.com or contact us at amazingabruzzotours@gmail.com.Amazing Abruzzo ToursI'm Jake Rupert. My wife Lisa Blais and I are opening a tourism business in Italy called Amazing Abruzzo Tours in May 2016. We're running this Indiegogo campaign to kick-start our business.We'd love for you to be part of our adventure, so we're offering the great deals on trips to Italy you see on the right.We're Canadians from Ottawa, Ontario, in our 40s who've grown tired of the rat race. We bought a historic villa in Italy, and we're ditching our careers to give people authentic Italian experiences in the breathtaking Abruzzo region, 90 minutes east of Rome. Get one of our packages, and you'll see exactly what we mean!Lisa's grandfather came to Canada from Abruzzo. It's an incredibly beautiful yet largely undiscovered place filled with interesting things to do and see. There are great wineries and food, mountains, beaches, quaint villages, festivals, hiking, biking, Roman ruins, castles and fabulous people who love having a good time.
We adore Abruzzo, and we are going to showcase it to the world through boutique, all-inclusive  packages and do-it-yourself tours of the area. Details of these products are below and pictures of the area are in the gallery. With us, you will get an authentic Italian experience.We're a family and LGBT friendly company. All are welcome at Amazing Abruzzo Tours.If you have any questions about this campaign, our company or our products, email us at amazingabruzzotours@gmail.com and we'll quickly get back to you.Project ProgressWe've purchased and paid for a five-bedroom, six-bathroom Villa for our company's home base. Villa d'Abruzzo's interior renovations are mostly done - new kitchen, heating, cooling, plumbing, electrical, etc. The place is fantastic. It oozes Italy.

We didn't take proper marketing shots of the Villa the last time we were there, but if you check out the pictures in the gallery, you'll get a great sense of the place.



Our business plan, market research, competitive analysis, operating plan and start-up plan are complete. Our marketing plan is done and will launch in the coming months. Our website is under construction, and all other final tasks are under way.
What We Need
Exterior works including a large terrace, a pool and landscape work are proceeding this summer. We also have start-up and fit-up costs. Through a combination of our savings and some debt, we have these works covered, but we'd love to launch our business with no debt, so we're looking to raise $150,000.


We're confident that we will reach our goal. But, if we don't, all funds from this campaign will still  go to the project. We will then supplement the balance with traditional funding, which we have secured, but not accessed.
What you get by contributing
Contributions will get you updates through various platforms. There's also neat Amazing Abruzzo swag like cheeseboards and key chains and framed pictures of the area.
The best perks are coupons and packages that will see you come to Italy, stay at Villa d'Abruzzo and enjoy food, wine, sights and much fun to be had with Amazing Abruzzo Tours.



If this is your first time to Italy, combine a seven-day package at Villa d'Abruzzo with a tour of Venice, Rome and Florence. A stay with us after a few days in these larger centres is a perfect introduction to ""la dolce vita""!
If you are returning to Italy, a week with Amazing Abruzzo Tours will show you an authentic side of the country tourists rarely get to experience.
We can accommodate up to eight people based on double occupancy for tours, and, as you can see further down on the right, our travel discounts are progressive, so the more people you book, the cheaper it is per person.
We can also customize tour options and bookings. If you want to focus on wine and food, we will build you a package. If you want to book for 10 days or rent the whole villa for a month for a family gathering, we can do that too. If you don't see what you need in the perk list, contact us and we'll work something out together.

The Impact
A contribution to the success of this campaign will have several impacts.
We have secured financing to complete our project, but a successful Indiegogo campaign will mean no borrowing. It will also allow us to relocate from Canada to Italy quickly to take care of the final details.
For the town of Torre de'Passeri where Villa d'Abruzzo is located, it will mean economic development because we will be using all local supplies and services including contractors, construction products and labour, wineries, and foods.
For Abruzzo, it means exposure. Italians love vacationing there, but even though it's only slightly off the beaten track, it remains largely undiscovered by foreign tourists.
Challenges
Starting a company in a new country and speaking your third language hasn't been easy, but Lisa and I are up to the challenge. I'm studying Italian, business planning and operations management. Lisa is taking an online marketing course.
We've assembled a great team in Italy and Canada, including a project manager, legal and business agents, a great architect, a dedicated contractor, several trusted advisers, and marketing experts. We're also getting good support from local officials in Torre de'Passeri.


Other Ways You Can Help
There are ways you can help this campaign besides financially.
You can spread the word in your network, like us on Facebook, or best of all forward a link to this campaign to people you think might be interested. Anything you can do to help us reach a bigger audience, including using the Indiegogo share tools, would be much appreciated.
Media
We are getting some love from media in Canada.

Since then, I have continued to build my reputation and clientele throughout the City of Philadelphia. My business is dependent upon customers that are open-minded and ready to embrace the confidence, joy, and character that wearing a pair of glasses can bring to their everyday lives.

<p>The wholesale price of imported lesser-quality eyewear has increased by 1000%, leaving the quality of the product far behind over the last decade. </p>

<li>Designers and countries being poorly represented </li>
<li>High costs for both small business owners and the customer</li>

</div></div>","Eyewear Proudly Handmade in the USA ! 

I want to bring an eyeglass manufacturing factory to Philadelphia accompanied by the knowledge and expertise of traditional French craftsmanship. I believe in selling design, quality, service and value over price. I see an opportunity to help others feel proud of what can be made here in the USA. I am convinced that the American Dream is still possible for everyone.  Timing and opportunity are perfectly aligned to rescue the knowledge of hand-made crafting from being lost. I insist on ensuring the control of quality and cost within an industry, which has inflated with style over substance; both of which I can offer without sacrifice. I want others to see what we have to gain by dreaming big here in Philly, but before I tell you about my dream, I want to tell you my story. 
My name is Valerie Vittu. I came to the USA in 1994 from France and became an American citizen in 2003. When I first got my start in the optical industry, I was fortunate enough to work with famed designer, Alain Mikli, whose concept was creating eyewear as both a precise medical device and a fashion accessory. My artistic background in design, eye for quality products, and years of experience in various high-end industries helped me to become an innovator in the fine eyewear field. In 2005, I created my first optical retail business named after my two daughters, Margot & Camille. Since then, I have continued to build my reputation and clientele throughout the City of Philadelphia. My business is dependent upon customers that are open-minded and ready to embrace the confidence, joy, and character that wearing a pair of glasses can bring to their everyday lives. Finding the right frames can truly be a transformative experience.I mark my tenth year as a business owner with many milestones: 
My own brand of eyewear and sunglasses (Margot & Camille)
A flourishing partnership with a French eyewear manufacturer
The opening of a second location in Doylestown, PA
New business partners
Our team and ambitions are expanding and we are ready to embrace the changes not just for my business, but for the community that has supported me for an entire decade. Making Our Own Waves
The wholesale price of imported lesser-quality eyewear has increased by 1000%, leaving the quality of the product far behind over the last decade. 
What Mass-Manufacturing has led to:


Designers and countries being poorly represented 
High costs for both small business owners and the customer
The loss of consistency in the Eyewear Industry 

Without the immediate establishment of control of manufacturing in the west, costs will continue to rise regardless of quality in the decades to come. Be the power that brings quality and market control to our own backyard. Become the driving force behind influencing the industry in contrast to being at it's mercy.
What's at risk:


Knowledge and appreciation of hand-sculpted eyewear
Support for manufacturing in Europe 
Accessibility to fine eyewear for everyday Americans
Our sense of ownership and pride in our own creations
The desire to create something worth making in the USA


It is urgent that we transfer the eyewear manufacturing process from France to the USA in order to rebuild our country, in addition to giving future generations pride in what they can produce.  



Every small business owner wants to succeed and grow, but my company has all of the tools: the knowledge and partnerships necessary to bring change to the American manufacturing landscape. We have the plans for opening and running the factory, the machinery is ready to be packed and shipped from France, including plenty of raw materials, for our trainees to learn with and perfect their craftsmanship. We are working closely with the City of Philadelphia and the Chamber of Commerce and their partners at the PIDC to ensure that our business expansion will help as many people as possible. 






Impact

New career opportunities 
Better cost control within the industry
Raise quality and accessibility of eyewear products
Strengthen communities within Philadelphia
Displays the financial and intrinsic value of creating something in their own neighborhood


The factory will be located close to public transportation centers so that we can provide free transportation for our employees. 

Why Donate?
Cover initial costs of training an entire workforce
Set up the factory and its machinery
Cover pre-production salaries 
Donations and Grants will allow us to be immediately competitive 
Training will involve one year of intensive quality control of crafting the material used to create the most comfortable, practical and beautiful eyewear. Luckily, we have the commitment from master ""lunetiers"" (eyewear craftsmen) to come to Philadelphia for the entirety of the training process to ensure that our production is indisputably world class. 
Long Road Ahead
 We want to offer a chance to learn the skills that have brought me success, fulfillment, and happiness. I want to see this factory give people the possibility of a brilliant future, but the hard work has only just begun. We need the community's support if we are going to find the funding that is necessary to open the factory's doors.

For example, the more support we get during our campaign means the more products we need to sew. Of course, sewing more products takes more time. But that is a good thing, right? </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Because we have established strong relationships with our vendors, because they are 100% behind our mission, and are all about supporting small businesses, we know they won't be wasting time. </p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This all started when Michele Lynberg Black was still an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She grew frustrated with the limited options in ""brief cases"" available for professional women who didn't want the ""manly"" look. So she made her own business bag - Version 1.0. Michele, as a scientist, knew a lot about crunching numbers, developing public health surveys, and all the other stuff that goes with public health research. She was also an experienced quilter and a mixed media artist with 40 years of sewing experience. But she knew very little about all the other things that were needed to make the dream of Mountain Bird Designs turn into a reality. Here's our dream team. </p>

The artwork is printed locally in North Carolina on recycled fabric using water-based ink with a process that generates minimal waste with no toxic by-products. 
Our products are then cut and sewn by a member-owned, fair pay cooperative in Morganton, NC. 

We ship from a local North Carolina fulfillment center that trains and employs people who are developmentally or physically disabled, facing employment barriers.


We have been working hard over the past 2 years, using money from our retirement savings, to build the foundation for Mountain Bird Designs.  We have done the research, learned how to navigate the textile industry, and connected with partners and vendors who share our mission. Our products have been designed, samples have been made and tested, and all the pieces needed for full production  are set in place and ready to go. Now all we need is you to set the wheels of change in motion. Our mission to create positive change in a tangible and substantive way can only happen with your help.
  

To enter production mode, we need to raise $25,000 in capital.  Here is how the funds will be used: 


Here is what you will receive for your contribution to positive change:
Original artwork created by one of our featured artists (without mat or frame.) Only available during this campaign. Contributions will be shared between supporting domestic violence survivors and contributing to meals for families facing hunger.

For all remaining perks, we will send you a follow-up email to gather the information we need to get things right.
A functional and artistic wallet clutch that keeps you organized in style. Our wallet clutches are 8 inches long, 4 inches high, and 1.5 inches wide. Lots of pockets inside and a place to stash your phone or keys. These clutches coordinate with our business bags. You are contributing to the support of 1 domestic violence survivor or contributing to 4 meals.


Our premier product keeps you organized in style. The business bags are 15 inches long, 11.5 inches high, and 4 inches wide. Lots of room for your phone, wallet, calendar, laptop, and more. There are pockets inside and out for all kinds of stuff. A key fob keeps those pesky keys at hand. These bags are solidly built and sturdy, so load it up with all the stuff you need!  You are contributing to the support of 2 domestic violence survivors or contributing to 12 meals.



$10 off the retail price. The combination of our business bag and wallet clutch keeps you super organized in style with easy access to the things you need. The functional wallet clutch gives you the opportunity to leave your bag behind when you need to dash into the grocery store on the way home. You are contributing to the support of  2 domestic violence survivors or contributing to 16 meals.


$20 off the retail price. You are contributing to the support of 4 domestic violence survivors or contributing to 32 meals. (By the way, you rock!)
 But there is even more you can do to support us by spreading the word and referring your friends. The more friends you send our way, the more women and children you are helping, and the more fair pay you are providing. We have some special gifts to show our gratitude.
Here's how you do it:
To be able to track your referrals, you need to promote our campaign with Indiegogo’s share tools while logged into your Indiegogo account. Your unique ID will be attached to any resulting contributions or visits.
For example, when you are logged into your account and use Indiegogo’s share tools to send a tweet, the link in the tweet includes your unique ID. Let's say your friend reads your tweet and clicks through the link to contribute, you will be recognized as helping bring in the amount contributed by your friend.
In short, simply log into your Indiegogo account, and use Indiegogo’s share tools to track your referrals. You can check your referrals through your Indiegogo profile or on our leaderboard that will be featured on our front page.
Here is what you can get for sharing the word:


If we meet our initial $25,000 goal, we will be able to contribute $2,500 to support domestic violence survivors and families facing hunger AND provide 625 hours of fair pay.
But together we REALLY can do WAY more than that! 

If we reach $87,000 in contributions, we will provide enough work to support another full time member of the sewing cooperative. That includes the costs of materials and approximately 2,175 hours of fair pay. We also will be contributing $8,700 to support domestic violence survivors and families facing hunger. Plus our artists will receive $8,700 for royalties in total. Every little bit adds.                                                       
Whether or not you can contribute to our campaign, you can make a difference by sharing our story. Use the Indiegogo share tools to get the word out!


We will keep you up to date on what we have been able to achieve together.

We have successfully addressed the biggest challenges to produce our products in a socially conscious way, with each step contributing to positive change. The remaining challenges relate to the time it takes to weave, print, and sew. While our estimated timeline for delivering your perks takes this into account, things happen that are beyond our control. For example, the more support we get during our campaign means the more products we need to sew. Of course, sewing more products takes more time. But that is a good thing, right? 
Because we have established strong relationships with our vendors, because they are 100% behind our mission, and are all about supporting small businesses, we know they won't be wasting time. 
We will keep you posted about where things are in the production process, so there will be no surprises. 

Now that you know more about Mountain Bird Designs, here is a little more about the Mountain Bird Designs team.
This all started when Michele Lynberg Black was still an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She grew frustrated with the limited options in ""brief cases"" available for professional women who didn't want the ""manly"" look. So she made her own business bag - Version 1.0. Michele, as a scientist, knew a lot about crunching numbers, developing public health surveys, and all the other stuff that goes with public health research. She was also an experienced quilter and a mixed media artist with 40 years of sewing experience. But she knew very little about all the other things that were needed to make the dream of Mountain Bird Designs turn into a reality. Here's our dream team.

<p></p> <p> </p><h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>The peri-urban slum areas 
of Tamil Nadu, India suffer 
from a critical lack of access to essential sanitation services.  In 
India, 50.4% of urban households have access to improved sanitation. 
However, only 18.2% of India’s impoverished peri-urban slum households 
have such access. In the urban area of Chennai in the state of Tamil 
Nadu, only 19% of slum households and 38% of non-slum households have 
access to toilets, with similar patterns observed in other peri-urban 
slum areas of Tamil Nadu.  This trend leads to the spread of waterborne 
diarrheal diseases caused by a variety of waterborne pathogens, the most
 common of which are rotavirus, giardia, cryptosporidium, campylobacter,
 E. coli, norovirus, shigella, and V. cholerae. (UNICEF)  Coupled with 
the lack of access to quality healthcare, diarrheal diseases can quickly
 result in life-threatening illnesses, and have become endemic in large 
segments of the Indian population. They constitute a leading cause of 
death among the Indian population, killing about 375,000 people each 
year, the majority of which are children under 5, but are entirely 
preventable. (The Lancet) We believe that we can change this through an 
innovative business model developed from the Ideation Lab's unique 
intensive, interdisciplinary, and competitive, yet simultaneously 
collaborative process.<br/><p> </p><div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> Although we are 
excited to be working with students, we do acknowledge that students may
 run into some difficulties in ideating and rolling out their business 
plans as students are not experts in the issues we will be grappling 
with and are often pressed for time. To address this issue, if any seed 
funding is given to student entrepreneurs, it will be given 
incrementally. We will also have a qualified team of mentors in 
business, public health, and research in the US and on the ground in 
India helping students solve any problems they may face and set them on 
the right track with their business planning and roll out. Most 
importantly, the person who we will select to ultimately assume the 
responsibility of being the CEO of an enterprise we launch, who will 
work alongside students, mentors, consultants, and employees and 
partners on the ground, will need to be someone who is locally 
culturally and linguistically competent, has an entrepreneurial mindset,
 and is willing to commit to the enterprise full time for a number of 
years.<p></p>

pressure, high blood cholesterol, high levels of body fat and fatty streaks in

considered overweight or obese. The World Health Organization considers
childhood inactivity and obesity two of the most serious public health
challenges of the century. If that isn’t shocking enough, physical inactivity
is now 1 of the top 10 leading causes of death worldwide. More people die each
year from living a sedentary life than they do from smoking. Seriously!</span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460733429/Campaign_image_1_gbdma8.svg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>The kids love to carry their monkeys with them even while balancing.</b></p><p>Childhood inactivity and obesity are
epidemics in nearly every corner of the world. They have profound, negative
impacts on the physical and emotional health of children, their families, and
society as a whole. While free play opportunities and physical activity bring a
multitude of cognitive, social, and emotional health benefits to children, these
are the very behaviors that have drastically declined in the past 25 years.
Because of this, children now face life long risk factors that stem from

public charity to help children who suffer from chronic illnesses like early
heart disease and Type ll diabetes to live healthier lives. For thirty years I
have been a personal trainer, educator and health coach. I have also dedicated
much of my life to studying animal behavior for the purpose of understanding,
protecting and helping to reduce human-wildlife conflict affecting endangered
species. With the creation of Hutan I was able to blend these two very
different career paths into one by developing a desperately needed activity
program to help children start life on a healthy path. The program is called
MonkeyPlay and it launched in the fall of 2015 reaching over 100 children.
MonkeyPlay is about improving physical literacy, or “the ability, confidence and
desire to be physically active for life.” The first goal is to reduce lifelong
health issues that stem from overweight and inactivity, like Type II diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, and many cancers. The secondary benefit: By using the
animal as a powerful mediator of concepts, children learn to appreciate
wildlife diversity, learn a multitude of scientific lessons from animal
behavior to geography, and develop an understanding of the interconnected
nature of wildlife to the environment. A healthy body, a healthy mind and a
healthy planet are necessary to ensure a life of well being.</p><p>
</p><p><b>HUTAN is a registered 501(c)3, all
contributions are tax deductible.</b></p>
<p>Up to this point I have funded the
development of the program along with all the materials with my personal
finances. I have not received any salary or financial compensation for
MonkeyPlay. The program has been a huge success, children squeal with delight
when it's MonkeyPlay day, and I am looking forward to continuing it in the
coming years. The problem is that the daycares and schools who could benefit
the most from the program cannot afford it. Presently, I charge about half the
price of what a parent would pay for many common extracurricular activities.
Even so, lower income areas cannot afford to participate, although children
there suffer with health problems at far higher rates than in wealthier
districts. I am raising money so that I may be able to bring the program to 5
selected daycares in these areas. I have developed a MonkeyPlay ""kit""
and training program so that each daycare will receive all the materials they
need to run the program themselves. This involves 10 hours of training at each
daycare, 5 manuals covering how to run the program, parent and child take home
activities to help develop healthy habits in the home, physical literacy
products like balance beams, tunnels, weave poles, cones and agility ladders,
along with 8 beautiful full-color signs (2' x 5') of animals and their
characteristic movements.  The money raised will be used to launch the
program into these daycares and guide the children who attend them into healthy
active lifestyles. The goal is lifelong chronic disease prevention. With these
5 daycares the program will reach over 500 children immediately! The sooner we reach our
funding goal the sooner we can start making a difference, now, when children
are young and need the guidance to shape their lives. For me this is a lifelong
passion and I have put my heart into making it happen. This is the first time
in my life I can honestly say, ""I love my job."" I can offer a huge
thank you in advance, because this will allow me to continue what is so needed
in the world today.  It is, however, in the lives of these children that

issue... the better lives children will have!
I truly believe we all want to improve the
world a little. We want to do our part; it gives purpose to our lives and
leaves us with a sense of gratification, if only for a moment, it lets us feel
good about ourselves. I have created this campaign so that we can address a
critical problem facing children across the globe. Taking the time to become
aware of the epidemic of childhood obesity and donating whatever possible will
feel good. But for 500 children it may make a lifetime of difference. The power
of a community when it pulls together is amazing.

<p>Parkside Brewing Company was established in the Fall of 2015 by Paul Kay, Shaun Ryan, Andy Jameson, and Wade Lancaster.  Our goal is to bring high quality craft beer to Burlington, Iowa and the surrounding communities.  Paul and Shaun, whom each are award-winning home brewers, developed a passion for creating unique and flavorful brews that they have long-shared with their family and friends.  They met as members of the local home brewers club known as the Burlington M.O.B (Makers of Beer), and formed a friendship around their interest in brewing.  Andy and Wade are longtime friends of Paul, and each share a fondness for craft beer and the craft beer industry.  Paul introduced Shaun to Andy and Wade, and as they say, “<i>the rest is history</i>”.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A genuine passion for high quality beer and the opportunity to fulfill a need for fresh, high quality, locally brewed beer in the Burlington-area market has set the four of us on a path to produce, market, and serve the highest quality craft beer in the region.  Paul and Shawn will oversee operations at Parkside Brewing Company.  Andy will manage finances, and Wade will direct marketing and sales activities for the company.  We each bring different skill sets that will help set Parkside Brewing Company apart from other breweries and brew pubs.</p>

Canhe-Fit est un petit pendentif connecté qui s'attache au collier 
de l'animal pour indiquer, via une application mobile, la quantité de 
nourriture dont votre animal a besoin.
Par ailleurs, l'application vous permet de suivre la consommation 
alimentaire et l'activité de votre animal. L'application fonctionne 
également comme un GPS, utilisant une localisation sociale qui vous 
permet de retrouver facilement votre chien ou votre chat perdu.

CANHE-FIT



LE PLUS PETIT OBJET CONNECTE POUR ANIMAUX DE COMPAGNIE, AVEC UN DESIGN FRANÇAIS





Changez son look au gré de vos envies en donnant un style tendance et coloré à votre animal. Canhegat a sélectionné cinq couleurs : rouge, cyan, orange, violet et noir. Notre version ""Canhe-Fit classic pack"" est accompagnée de deux couleurs : cyan et violet.










Connaissez-vous la quantité exacte de nourriture dont chacun a besoin ?

La quantité de nourriture doit être optimisé par rapport à la race de votre animal, son âge, son poids et son activité. 20% (au Japon) à 50% (aux Etats-Unis) des chats et des chiens sont obèses ou en surpoids dans le monde.
Maintenez leur poids, vous maintenez leur santé!

Une grande partie de la santé de votre animal découle de la manière dont vous le nourrissez. L'obésité (30% de surpoids) réduit de 2 ans l'espérance de vie des animaux de compagnie, et augmente les risques : de cancer, de maladie cardiaque, de diabète, d'arthrite et de mort prématurée. 
Savez vous quelle est la meilleure formule d'aliment pour eux?

Meilleur est l'aliment et plus belle sera leur vie. Avec plusieurs milliers de marques différentes, il est difficile de sélectionner la plus adaptée sans dépenser beaucoup d'argent dans un régime spécifique.

Les fonctions de Canhe-Fit

Après avoir rempli le profil de votre animal et après avoir sélectionné la marque régulière d'aliments que vous lui donnez, notre application vous dira quelle quantité de nourriture lui distribuer par rapport à son poids, son âge, sa race et son activité.

Dès que votre animal se rapproche de votre téléphone, toutes les données sont téléchargées, analysées par nos web-services et sauvegardées dans notre base de données.

No chance for prying eyes


""Simply chill out in peace, completely undisturbed: the HideoutLounge lets you look out but prevents people looking in. The slightly subdued sun and a light breeze have a cooling effect, creating a comfortable indoor climate, ideal for sunbathing or just relaxing."" 
- Ann-Sophie 



Take your place in your favourite space!

HideoutLounge is a private space for your garden, your balcony, or any of your favourite outdoor places. Let's see which fascinating features will make it your favourite space:

No looking in



The special fabric used for the HideoutLounge makes it impossible to look into the interior from outside. The observer sees the attractive HideoutLounge but cannot make out what is happening within. So you are completely undisturbed.



A lovely view from inside







The design of HideoutLounge enables you to look out from inside. You see everything that is going on around you. Enjoy your terrace, balcony, garden or the countryside unobserved from the surroundings.

Bright interior 

The fabric slightly softens the sunshine, resulting in a friendly interior that is ideal for sunbathing or getting tanned. The material even provides a low UV protection factor of 2 – 3 against the sun.


Feel-good climate


The exterior of the HideoutLounge acts as a windbreak but permits a comfortable and cooling breeze through. No annoying heating up and no access for irritating insects.

Simply try it out – you will love it.
The quickest way to get the HideoutLounge is to participate in this Indiegogo Campaign. Choose one of the three different models and pick a HideoutLounge perk at the all-time low campaign price. And then take your place in your new favourite space. 



High quality, special fabric, and a cool design
The fabric is weather-resistant and can simply be cleaned with water. It is UV-resistant and difficult to ignite. The HideoutLounge is easy to put up but stable. It does not weigh much and is therefore effortlessly moved by two people.
You can easily roll up the sides and you’re sitting in an arcade or pergola. Put down the sides and close them using the zip (from inside or outside) if you would prefer more privacy.




Great features: 


Suffused with sunshine - Enjoy the sun in the HideoutLounge
without being dazzled. 
Easy assembly - a simple push-in system. No
drilling or screws necessary.
Weather-resistant - robust materials and
easy to clean with water.
Delivery - the HideoutLounge will be
delivered to your house. 
Recharge your batteries - next spring you will
already be able to rejuvenate in your favourite space. 

Enjoy your privacy - in your new HideoutLounge.

      am 25 years old and recently graduated from University of California, Los
      Angeles (UCLA) with a double major in Business Economics and
      Communication Studies. When I was 8 years old, my mother, an
      entrepreneur in China sent me to the United States to receive a better
      education and a more hopeful future. Since I was 8 years old, I moved
      across the country away from my whole family to start this new and  promising life. Like a typical Asian family, they expected me to graduate
      college and get a job in a big corporation and start making big money.
      But my life took an unexpected turn for a more purposeful and passion-filled life.</span></h3>

      life to make a lasting difference in places in need. Specifically, I saw
      that Haiti needed a long-term solution to get out of poverty, something
      that a two-week trip cannot solve. The root of Haiti’s problem, and for
      other third world countries is economy instability and lack of job
      opportunities for the people. I was determined to find the solution
      to bring much needed sustainability to this country.</span><br/></p>

      business to create jobs, starting with Haiti. Our mission is to put
      ‘Haiti in the hands of Haitians.’ There was a sense of finding my
      purpose. I was now able to combine all I have ever learned from family

<p><i>""In the wake of Haiti’s devastating 7.0-magnitude earthquake...former U.S. President Bill Clinton issued an unusual and now infamous apology. Calling his subsidies to American rice farmers in the 1990s a mistake because it undercut rice production in Haiti, Clinton said he had struck a 'devil’s bargain' that ultimately resulted in greater poverty and food insecurity in Haiti...'I have to live every day with the consequences of the lost capacity to produce a rice crop in Haiti to feed those people, because of what I did.'""</i> Read more at <a href=""http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/01/11/subsidizing-starvation/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">foreignpolicy.com</a>.<br/></p>
<p>Reconsider the way you are doing charity. Are you becoming the problem or are you becoming the solution? Are you disabling the people with your short-term aid or are you empowering them with a long-term solution?</p>

<li>Hand-outs</li>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Problems:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Only way for producers to enter into the market is through competitive

<p>Solutions:</p>

<h3>But now we need you. Join the movement.</h3>
<p>You will be joining a
movement to bring countries in need out of poverty. When you support our cause
through this campaign, the money goes directly into the business model of
changing the way we do charity. We are using IndieGoGo as a jumpstart for the
expansion stage of the structure already taking place. Let's empower the local people and create some sustainable job opportunities together!</p>
<p></p>
<h3>It's time to expand. </h3>
<p>If we can raise
$50,000, Elisha C. can move into a full year’s worth of expansion in its 2nd year! We will have the capacity to hire staff, purchase from more Haitian producers
on the waiting list to support sustainable jobs, expand our Haiti product line,
connect producers to businesses, and host Haiti EXPOs around the world. </p>

      entrepreneur in China sent me to the United States to receive a better
      education and a more hopeful future. Since I was 8 years old, I moved
      across the country away from my whole family to start this new and  promising life. Like a typical Asian family, they expected me to graduate
      college and get a job in a big corporation and start making big money.
      But my life took an unexpected turn for a more purposeful and passion-filled life.




Summer of my sophomore year 2009, I went on my first
      mission trip to Fond Doux Haiti with a student group called Chi Alpha at
      UCLA. I fell in love with Haiti. But it wasn’t until I came back from my
      7th trip in Dec 2011 that I found a passion to dedicate my
      life to make a lasting difference in places in need. Specifically, I saw
      that Haiti needed a long-term solution to get out of poverty, something
      that a two-week trip cannot solve. The root of Haiti’s problem, and for
      other third world countries is economy instability and lack of job
      opportunities for the people. I was determined to find the solution
      to bring much needed sustainability to this country.



In December 2013, I launched Elisha C. with the vision
      to bring economic stability to places in need by using international
      business to create jobs, starting with Haiti. Our mission is to put
      ‘Haiti in the hands of Haitians.’ There was a sense of finding my
      purpose. I was now able to combine all I have ever learned from family
      business and my major to help solve a problem that is much bigger than me,
      bringing sustainability and hope to places of desperation.
We are changing the way we do charity. 

There is an old proverb that says, ""Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime."" These are wise words we need to take to heart when dealing with the crisis of world poverty. 
The Problem - Why did Bill Clinton apologize? 
""In the wake of Haiti’s devastating 7.0-magnitude earthquake...former U.S. President Bill Clinton issued an unusual and now infamous apology. Calling his subsidies to American rice farmers in the 1990s a mistake because it undercut rice production in Haiti, Clinton said he had struck a 'devil’s bargain' that ultimately resulted in greater poverty and food insecurity in Haiti...'I have to live every day with the consequences of the lost capacity to produce a rice crop in Haiti to feed those people, because of what I did.'"" Read more at foreignpolicy.com.
Reconsider the way you are doing charity. Are you becoming the problem or are you becoming the solution? Are you disabling the people with your short-term aid or are you empowering them with a long-term solution?
The Problem - The Old Ways of Charity

Hand-outs
Only for the rich people
Give and walk away/drop and go
Giver and receiver are disconnected
Results in disabling the people being helped
The country/people remain in the pit of poverty/bottom of the
     social ladder

What if we combine charity
with consumerism?
Old consumerism -



Problems:


Only way for producers to enter into the market is through competitive
       pricing, whoever can offer the lowest cost of production gets the deal,
       resulting in very minimal gain for producers or even taking a loss for their production.


No sustainability for the small producers


Devalue products/producers


Big mark ups for the businesses, while minimal returns for the
       producers


Keeping producing countries/people down & stagnate in the
       social ladder






New consumerism - 


Solutions:



Direct purchase from the producers at fair prices


Story telling, share the stories of the producers, giving them a voice


Add value to products, producers, and your purchases


Sustainability for producers & job creation for people in need


A chance for countries to rise out of poverty and climb up the social ladder


The Solution - Elisha C.Elisha C. is a social enterprise to redefine charity and business. By combining them, we have the power to use your everyday purchases as an act of creating sustainability in another person's life. We can end poverty together by using our first-world consumerism to bring economic stability to third-world countries.
How?

Bridges – We are building bridges to directly connect producers, such as artisans and farmers directly to the global marketplace. We facilitate resources to go back as investments to multiply the opportunities being created.

Platforms - We are building platforms to support sustainable job creation for producers, such as artisans and farmers in the global marketplace.




The Solution - The New Way of Charity


Hand-up
For everyone through everyday purchases
An investment to “plant seeds &
     help it grow.” See it multiply. 
Be involved in the process of charity
Enable and empower the people
A chance to climb out of the ditch of poverty and up the social
     ladder.

The impact we have made already.


**HAITI EXPO is a worldwide traveling exhibition that we host for all artisans to participate to raise positive Haiti awareness and create a platform for producers to be seen and heard. See Image gallery and our SITE for more.**5 producers of Haiti includes Atelier Calla [Horn & Bone Jewelry], Apparent Project [Upcycled Artisan Goods], Haitian Production [Handpainted Art], EcoCafe Haiti [Award-winning Haitian Coffee] & Bohiomania [Stone Jewelry]. See Image gallery and our SHOP for more. 
Here are the 26 students, including 6 university students we put into school:





We are breaking
the cycle of poverty and putting ‘Haiti in the hands of Haitians.’
But now we need you. Join the movement.
You will be joining a
movement to bring countries in need out of poverty. When you support our cause
through this campaign, the money goes directly into the business model of
changing the way we do charity. We are using IndieGoGo as a jumpstart for the
expansion stage of the structure already taking place. Let's empower the local people and create some sustainable job opportunities together!

It's time to expand. 
If we can raise
$50,000, Elisha C. can move into a full year’s worth of expansion in its 2nd year! We will have the capacity to hire staff, purchase from more Haitian producers
on the waiting list to support sustainable jobs, expand our Haiti product line,
connect producers to businesses, and host Haiti EXPOs around the world. 
The potentials of the change we can make together.


Our goals to accomplish in
Haiti this year and more:



Invest
in at least five more producers/artisans/farmers on the waiting list in support of sustainable jobs


Bring
to the global market new Haiti product lines such as 100% natural oils
(cosmetic), variety in Haitian coffee from different areas of Haiti, Haitian
cocoa beans for Haitian chocolate, etc.


Launch
new economic development projects/micro-enterprises for local Haitian people,
such as chicken coop and agricultural programs


Launch
artisan training programs in the rural villages lacking opportunities


Sponsor more students to get an education in the rural communities


Increase
scholarships to fund students in universities – bringing them from the village
to the city


Continue
to break the cycle of poverty



The PERKS.
 On top of funding the expansion of Elisha C., we are committed to use a portion of your support to create more sustainable opportunities for the people of Haiti.





The Future is bright.
 This is just the beginning. We are just getting started.
Haiti is only the first of many places we will use this model to change the way we do charity. Join our movement and we can end poverty by empowering the people and creating sustainable job opportunities around the world!

<p>Mankind has always been drawn to acquire knowledge and explore the surroundings. Today, we are a species that has managed to completely explore and become an advanced civilisation in our home planet, The Earth. Technology allows us to strive for more and push our existence to outer space and beyond. We are in the process of a new step in evolution towards becoming a multi-planetary species. There is an increasing number of people who realise this and have expressed support to aim for a human colony on Mars, our nearest artificially habitable planet. </p><p>These people are brave and have the courage to face the new and unknown and are determined to make the dream of a successful manned mission to Mars, a reality. </p><p>These are the kind of people who will be remembered forever as pioneers and as a generation of ambitious explorers.</p>
<p>We will prove that mankind is capable of achieving the impossible - bringing life to a seemingly cold and lifeless planet like Mars.</p><p>MarsPolar is a private international initiative, which aims to research and plan the establishment of a human colony on Mars. We are a group of space enthusiasts, scientists, engineers, designers and dreamers, who plan to work to push the boundaries of space exploration. We are working to establish connections with researchers, scientists, space agencies and private space companies. We then intend to dedicate specialised teams to try and work on specific problems, that help us reach closer to the dream of establishing an artificial habitat on Mars. </p><p>We invite you to become a part of a new society of space enthusiasts, pioneers, facilitators of research and dreamers. Your enthusiasm, support and contribution will help us reach our goal of creating the first settlement on Mars together.</p><p></p><a name=""Objectives"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><h1 style=""color: #C23A2C;"">Our first objectives</h1></a><div>

<p>The event consists of three sections. In the first section, a competition on a rugged terrain akin to martian conditions is conducted where rover designs will be tested and competed against each other. Participants are students, graduates and university staff and the task for the teams is to design and build a rover which they use to compete in five competitions. The team with the highest score from the five competitions is declared winner.</p>

The idea would be to incorporate instruments required for the First Mission in the basic rover design and present it to NASA and SpaceX. A potential idea is to also present it to ESF itself thereby attracting its partners and sponsors into funding further for the project.<br/>

Introduction
Mankind has always been drawn to acquire knowledge and explore the surroundings. Today, we are a species that has managed to completely explore and become an advanced civilisation in our home planet, The Earth. Technology allows us to strive for more and push our existence to outer space and beyond. We are in the process of a new step in evolution towards becoming a multi-planetary species. There is an increasing number of people who realise this and have expressed support to aim for a human colony on Mars, our nearest artificially habitable planet. These people are brave and have the courage to face the new and unknown and are determined to make the dream of a successful manned mission to Mars, a reality. These are the kind of people who will be remembered forever as pioneers and as a generation of ambitious explorers.
We will prove that mankind is capable of achieving the impossible - bringing life to a seemingly cold and lifeless planet like Mars.MarsPolar is a private international initiative, which aims to research and plan the establishment of a human colony on Mars. We are a group of space enthusiasts, scientists, engineers, designers and dreamers, who plan to work to push the boundaries of space exploration. We are working to establish connections with researchers, scientists, space agencies and private space companies. We then intend to dedicate specialised teams to try and work on specific problems, that help us reach closer to the dream of establishing an artificial habitat on Mars. We invite you to become a part of a new society of space enthusiasts, pioneers, facilitators of research and dreamers. Your enthusiasm, support and contribution will help us reach our goal of creating the first settlement on Mars together.Our first objectives

a. Support the European Rover Challenge organised  by the European Space Foundation
Our current partner - The European Space Foundation is organising an event in September, 2015 called the European Rover Challenge.
The European Rover Challenge is a unique event that brings together students, engineers and technical enthusiasts who are interested in robotics. The event also attracts a wider audience including children, senior citizens and families who are interested in taking part in a technologically enriching phenomenon.
The event consists of three sections. In the first section, a competition on a rugged terrain akin to martian conditions is conducted where rover designs will be tested and competed against each other. Participants are students, graduates and university staff and the task for the teams is to design and build a rover which they use to compete in five competitions. The team with the highest score from the five competitions is declared winner.
By helping us you are also supporting young and talented
designers, engineers who constructing Martian rovers!
A part of funds from our Indiegogo campaign will be used to support ERC in Poland. We will also work with the winning team to develop their rover further.

b. Register MarsPolar company in UAEAfter reaching the campaign's goal we will register our company in UAE.License for three years costs about $8-10 k.c.Establish our headquarters and research centerFor the initial setup, we intend to have the following facilities:• Office for the team• Experimental labs for research• Workshop for components fabrication• Quality and safety testing facilities• Training area and small lecture roomsThe experimental labs and workshop will contain required material and tools to work on the development of the rover. A clean- room would have to be constructed along with a fabrication lab for the design and creation of micro-components that are required for the rover.In the long run, we envision a more advanced facility and some ambitious infrastructure. An advanced facility would have launch pads, landing areas, ranges, payload assembly buildings, payload processing facilities, laboratories, facilities and equipment for the construction of payloads, spaceflight hardware, rockets and other launch vehicles and other spaceport facilities and aerospacerelated systems. Besides setting up hardware and required infrastructure, a good maintenance system is also required and will be state-of-the-art. The most important agenda is to build a quality infrastructure at a minimal cost.Long Term Goals:1. Expand the facilities of the MPSC2. Constantly upgrade infrastructure to make MPSC the ideal operations centre for a manned Mars mission3. Emerge as the leading private space company in the region possibly expanding into areas of Space technology and exploration beyond the Mars missions



The planned future MarsPolar Spacecenter



d.Work on our first rover mission to Mars

One of our first missions to Mars will involve the constructing of two rovers to be sent to two different locations on Mars. 


The first one will arrive to a possible future manned mission landing site to investigate the area for the setting up of a habitat.
The second rover will most likely to be placed on location favourable for communication and will be tasked to explore the different surface features of Mars. We envision an idea that this location could be the north pole, which could potentially be a site with frozen water. Also, the polar environment is definitely worth studying, however challenges pertaining power will have to be circumvented since the pole will receive negligible sunlight during a part of the year.
We plan to construct rovers to with support existing rover projects. For example, projects financed by European Space Foundation. The idea is to take the best ideas and transform them to working projects while maintaining a low cost of development. 

We figured that by supporting the ERC, we are contributing to the development of potential rovers. Our idea is that we some part of donations to support the ERC and some part  for the rover development project. The winning team from the competition will be invited to work with us and we intend to use the best concepts from their design and improve on it using the allocated fund. The idea would be to incorporate instruments required for the First Mission in the basic rover design and present it to NASA and SpaceX. A potential idea is to also present it to ESF itself thereby attracting its partners and sponsors into funding further for the project.





Why UAE?


The United Arab Emirates is an emerging player in the Space sector, and has strived to produce an attractive framework for business. UAE is strategically located in the heart of Middle East and is equidistant from the west and east. 
UAE is a leading business hub; it offers access to connecting with potential investors better than any other location currently. We also believe that UAE offers a favourable environment to set up a business from a legal standpoint, having few complications and an easy registration procedure.
Therefore the key factors to choosing Dubai are:
A growing market - Dubai’s imports have more than doubled since 1989; regional economic growth and liberalisation is set to grow massivelyA prosperous market - Strategic location at the heart of one of the world’s richest regions

A diversified market - Wide import requirements and opportunities to partner with suppliers for components

And did you know that UAE has started it's own Mars Exploration Program?

</div></div>","Lets Fix Our Youth Problem!!!
Get Our Youth There (GOYT) would like to invite you to participate in addressing the pressing issues youth and young adults face in your  communities. Let's do something about the youth being gunned down in the streets, living without the basics of life, experiencing poor success, struggling with drug and alcohol addictions, being incarcerated and failed by school systems, and the many other issues they face! 
We need YOUR support to help us finalize our youth one-stop-shop development and begin to strengthen the youth organizations in your communities. 
Our Solution To Your Community Issues!!!

 

We are a start-up youth program development firm that specializes in data gathering, data analytics, and custom youth program development. In short, our plan is to strengthen and empower the youth organizations in communities around the world and in-turn they will be better equipped to produce and operate better youth solutions. 
Our model centers on providing holistic services to all youth organizations (start-up to large organizations; Non-Profits or Social Enterprises). Our work is classified into two categories: full-service consulting and a one-stop-shop youth system. 
Full-service Consulting!!!
Our belief is that the key to our youth problems lies in the DATA. For this reason, we:



Work with organizations to gather the data, in the organization or community,  needed to perform a sound analysis for a fledgling program or measure an existing program.


Work with organizations to analyze data to conceive, develop, or measure youth programs.
Work with an organization to create custom-tailored youth programs based the community's needs and their capabilities. 

No issue is too difficult for GOYT to solve! Your youth issues is our business!


One-stop-shop youth system (GOYT System)
We understand that some organizations need more than just consulting services, and that's why we developed a one-stop-shop system that any small to medium sized youth organization can use to power their youth operations. This includes 


Youth ministries, 
Community Development Corporations, 

and any other youth mandated organization. 


In short, the one-stop-shop system operates a system of specific business policies, program development methodologies, and support channels. Our system is designed to help an organization get off the ground or optimize their current operations. Each system is tailorable and functions in accordance to an organization’s size, mission, and vision.  


The whole purpose of the system is to ensure that the organization has a solid business infrastructure, has the capability of producing custom solutions to community issues, and has the necessary resources to make it all possible (including funding).  This is how our GOYT system looks in a organization!
       
GOYT System Internals!!!
Our GOYT system encompasses two parts:

A System of Operations
A System of Addressing Community Issues

Essentially, we provide all of the business principles (Policies) a youth organization needs to operate a sustainable youth organization and a simple-to-use data gathering, data analytics, and custom program development methodology that accelerates an organization's youth operations. 
organizations will have the capability of operating a sustainable and measurable youth organization at a cost (time, quality, and money) less than any other organization in the industry can offer or you could do on your own.  In addition, the GOYT system does not come attached with a must operate solution; its all based on the community's need and the organization's capabilities.

The Projected Social Impact 

In a nut-shell, social return means ""what will my contribution do for society."" Well, your contribution to GOYT does a lot for society. We equip organizations to positively impact the lives of the youth in their community. By equipping tens of thousands of organizations ........ well..... you see what we mean. It's a lot; thousands, millions, even billions of youth and young adults impacted.   Now thats social return!!!
For the technical people, we calculate our social returns by aggregating the social return totals of all measurable outcomes that our GOYT system operators produce. We project that our social returns will surpass $1000 per $1 contributed to GOYT as we grow. Provided below is visual representation of the Company's social return model:                    





Outside of our quantitative social return, GOYT solutions will produce verifiable qualitative social returns that you can see, feel, and visit.

Why a for profit? 
We operate as a for-profit  organization because we value the capability of using the financial channels of the for-profit world to accelerate our social work. Essentially, it makes more sense in the long run! 
What is a social enterprise? 
A social enterprise is an organization that applies commercial strategies to maximize improvements in human and environmental well-being, rather than maximizing profits for external shareholders. This means that the Company is more focused on the social returns rather than the financial returns. 
What is social return? 
Social return is a financial calculation that measures extra financial value by analyzing resources invested in a project and the outcomes produced by that project.  In short, what does my contribution do for society.
What is a one-stop-shop? 
A one-stop-shop means that you do not need to go out side of GOYT for anything youth related. If you need it we have it, or will help you get it. 
How does technology play into GOYT? 
We operate a system of support that uses certain technological tools that help our licensees connect with their communities and streamline their operations.  Essentially, we are working to build a global community network of people, organizations, and solutions. 
What is the current stage of the Company?
The Company is currently in the start-up stage. This means that we are still working through the kinks and honing GOYT. Just so you know, we are striving to make GOYT the pinnacle in the youth services industry and a staple in every youth's life.  
When can I get a GOYT System?
We are currently establishing a waitlist for our GOYT system and will start to implement them into organizations once we finish the first version of our support technology. This could be as early as the last quarter of 2015 or as late as the first quarter of 2016. We are however working with organizations in a consulting capacity.  
How much is a GOYT System?
We are still working on price, but just know we pride ourselves on making our services affordable for the everyday person with a passion for youth. 

How long does it take to get a GOYT System up and running?
This depends on the organization. It could be as little as a couple of weeks or a few months. Each organization will be different and be more or less complex. 
I need help with a youth program; How can I engage GOYT?
Shoot us an email at any time and we'll personally call you to talk through the details.",15.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Summary</h3>Hi! We're Cath Edwards, Peter Hawkins and Tom Keane. Together, we're the Green Party's first ever candidates both for general and local council elections in the constituencies of Telford and The Wrekin.
<p>We believe this is a really exciting time for the Green Party, both at a local and a national level. We want to give the people of Telford and The Wrekin the opportunity to make their voices heard, and to show the main political parties that there's a better way to run the country.<br/></p>
<p>Meet our candidates:<br/></p> <ul> <li>Cath is running as MP for The Wrekin and Councillor for Ironbridge Ward.</li> <li>Peter is running as MP for Telford and Councillor for Church Aston and Lilleshall Ward.</li> <li>Tom is running for Councillor for Madeley and Sutton Hill Ward.</li> </ul> <p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>While it's true that we've received a small amount of funding from the Green Party to cover our deposits, we need your help to be able to run a successful election campaign. Like all Green Party candidates, we receive no funding from big business, so we're dependent on donations from people who truly believe in our cause.</p>
<p>We need funding from you to be able to get leaflets printed so that our team of volunteers can deliver them to the wards in which we're standing. This may seem like a simple request but without them, we won't be able to get our message to the people of Telford. </p>
<p>But what's in it for you? We can't offer any fabulous perks.  What we can offer you, though, is a commitment to changing things for the better. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will fight privatisation of the NHS and oppose further cutbacks to essential healthcare services in the region</li>
<li>We will push to renationalise the railways</li>
<li>We will address the threat of current levels of carbon emissions to the environment, including opposing fracking both in Telford and nationally</li>
<li>We will move to scrap zero-hour contracts and introduce a living wage for every working person</li>
<li>We will work to implement tighter regulation of the financial sector, and prevent the harm that austerity measures are having on the region and the nation's poorest people.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
If you can identify with any of these points, you're the kind of person we need.<br/><br/>We're under no illusions: we've got a tough fight on our hands against 
the more established parties.  But, at the very least, we can start a 
conversation.  We can get the main parties to sit up and take notice of 
the issues that really matter to people.<br/><br/>
</div><div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We understand that not everyone can afford to help financially. You can still help us out, though, by telling people about this page and our campaign on Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn.</p>

<p><b>Our Goal:</b></p>
<p>The purpose of the Rx Wine Bar Lab is to create the most engaging and unique wine experience in the heart of downtown Durham.  The plan is twofold.  First offer incredible wines with fun, knowledgeable service in a dynamic setting featuring as much recycled and reclaimed materials from Durham as possible. <i>Terroir</i> but for design!  The second is to provide an educational component in the form of wine classes taught by Fred Dex <a href=""http://www.freddexms.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.freddexms.com</a>, the only Master Sommelier in the Carolinas.  These will not be sterile lectures; we have in mind exploratory adventures in the multi-faceted world of wine such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rainbow Connection - An Exploration of Colors and Flavors</li>
<li>Get into the Groove - Music Pairings</li>
<li>The “New” New World</li>
<li>Six Wines You Never Heard of That Will Change Your Wine Drinking Forever</li>
</ul>
<p>And with Fred’s unparalleled access to winemakers and importers there will be plenty of opportunity for guest speakers and exotic tastings.  Whether you’re a business looking to educate staff or a passionate wine lover looking to learn more, we will have classes to suit any experience level.  Let us teach you the secrets of the somms!</p>

</div></div>","Our travels have taken us to exotic places and we've found some incredible wines we'd like to share with you!  Drink Very, Very, Very Old Vine Juice with Us! This vineyard in nearly 200 years old!
Our Goal:
The purpose of the Rx Wine Bar Lab is to create the most engaging and unique wine experience in the heart of downtown Durham.  The plan is twofold.  First offer incredible wines with fun, knowledgeable service in a dynamic setting featuring as much recycled and reclaimed materials from Durham as possible. Terroir but for design!  The second is to provide an educational component in the form of wine classes taught by Fred Dex www.freddexms.com, the only Master Sommelier in the Carolinas.  These will not be sterile lectures; we have in mind exploratory adventures in the multi-faceted world of wine such as:

Rainbow Connection - An Exploration of Colors and Flavors
Get into the Groove - Music Pairings
The “New” New World
Six Wines You Never Heard of That Will Change Your Wine Drinking Forever

And with Fred’s unparalleled access to winemakers and importers there will be plenty of opportunity for guest speakers and exotic tastings.  Whether you’re a business looking to educate staff or a passionate wine lover looking to learn more, we will have classes to suit any experience level.  Let us teach you the secrets of the somms!

 We are connected to local & national media outlets to draw more people to drink wine in Durham!

 Education in Action!100 year old vineyard in the Southwest of France.  You must taste these wines with us! Come get ""dirty"" with us! Our favorite topic! We focus on as many sustainable, organic and biodynamically farmed wines as we can find! This vineyard is as biodynamic as you can find. This chamomile is farmed in the vineyard and used a treatment after it's harvested.  

 We taste the grapes before they become wine!A true ""Wine Lab""! We will teach the difference in flavor between these aging vessels! Yes, there is a difference! 

 We have the keys to the greatest wines in the World! This is one of the greatest vineyards in Burgundy! Pinot Noir at it's finest! 
Our wine bar experience will be focused on the sale of wine and beer.  We plan to have a basic food menu consisting mostly of local cheese and cured meats.  The simplicity of our food will save us money on kitchen equipment and not put us in direct competition with other great restaurants with outstanding wine programs in the area.  We’re the place to start or end your night with a great drink and yummy snack.  Or heck, spend your whole evening with us if you want!
Our philosophy for the operation of the wine bar will be guided by three ideals: hospitality, excellence of product, and fun.

Hospitality: we are three sommeliers with over forty years combined service experience.  Our focus on intelligent hospitality offers a place for those of a distinguishing palate and those who just want to explore more of what the world of wine has to offer at all levels by feeling empowered to taste and learn.
Product: every wine, beer, and food item will be tasted and vetted by all three owners to ensure you enjoy the best we can offer.  Partnering with local bakeries and farms will allow us to serve the freshest and tastiest provisions the Triangle has to offer.  The focus of our wine list will be to offer the most comprehensive, affordable opportunities for wine enjoyment and education.
Fun: your trip to Rx (pronounced Rocks!) won’t be a stuffy or intimidating visit.  Our goal is to inject as much of our love of music, movies, and pop culture into the experience as possible.  From theme nights like Metal Monday to movie themed wine pairings, we want to bring the joy of wine to the people of Durham.


We will have focused and serious tastings in The Lab spanning nearly every country, region and variety we can get our hands on! 

Driver's seat view of our classes and tastings!

At the end of the day we believe wine, from the finest Bordeaux to the most humble village offering, is a drink meant to be shared and enjoyed.
Who We Are:
Rx is the Latin reference for “to take” or “recipe,” and wine has been prescribed since the Hippocratic era as a remedy throughout history.  Our take on Rx is a great glass of wine as a prescription for relaxation and a protocol for fun here in the City of Medicine.  The genesis of our project came when we three sommeliers met working in Durham and saw the city’s passion for and enjoyment of wine.  We saw a way to give back to the community by providing the knowledge and experience needed to focus that passion into an elevated wine culture.  Three wine geeks, one singular obsession: to boldly go where Durham has never gone before.

<br/>
<p>We are located in the northern Peloponnese just outside the village Seliana. The valley where Liveloula is situated is rich in water, diverse in vegetation, it’s so beautiful.  For now, we are cultivating parts of a 1 hectare plot.  Two sides of this plot are bordered by forest and the other sides are (abandoned) orchards. For the community to further develop, Liveloula aims to grow in space to.  This we’d like to achieve by means of purchasing land partly to allow the return of wilderness, partly to restore old orchards, stimulating the biologic fruit production in this valley.</p>
<p>Liveloula is off grid.  Power is generated with photovoltaics and there are plans to build a hydro-electric system powered by a river nearby.  Our drinking water comes from a spring and irrigation water is tapped from a stream higher up in the forest. Last year the first natural building was finished and this year we’ll start building the second one.  <br/>75% of the vegetables we ate last year were organic and grown locally. <br/><br/></p>

<br/>
<br/><p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>Many plans for the coming year!   First of all, Liveloula aims to become a non-profit organisation to support it’s activities.</p>
<p>Profits will be spent to support growth, local initiatives focusing on the preservation of nature, the production of low impact, quality foods and the information and sensibilisation of both the local community and visitors on the subject of low impact living, self sustainability, community networking and general health.<br/><br/></p>

Liveloula is an organically growing project with a focus on peaceful, ecological and self sustainable living.  We are connected with the Re-Green Eco Cultural centre in Seliana, planning to become their all bio vegies and fruits provider.

Our hope is to grow into a community of good neighbors, connected by some communal crossroads and bound by the wish to improve our way of living in a sustainable, low impact way.
Our strongest belief is that to change humanity's current crash course it's vital for a critical number of people to gear down, reconnect with our mother earth, rooting back into the matrix of abundance, in simplicity finding ways to support ourselves, and all life surrounding us.  No doubt the wheels of change are already turning as hundreds of alike groups and communities arise around the globe.    




We are located in the northern Peloponnese just outside the village Seliana. The valley where Liveloula is situated is rich in water, diverse in vegetation, it’s so beautiful.  For now, we are cultivating parts of a 1 hectare plot.  Two sides of this plot are bordered by forest and the other sides are (abandoned) orchards. For the community to further develop, Liveloula aims to grow in space to.  This we’d like to achieve by means of purchasing land partly to allow the return of wilderness, partly to restore old orchards, stimulating the biologic fruit production in this valley.
Liveloula is off grid.  Power is generated with photovoltaics and there are plans to build a hydro-electric system powered by a river nearby.  Our drinking water comes from a spring and irrigation water is tapped from a stream higher up in the forest. Last year the first natural building was finished and this year we’ll start building the second one.  75% of the vegetables we ate last year were organic and grown locally. 



   What We Need & What You Get 
Many plans for the coming year!   First of all, Liveloula aims to become a non-profit organisation to support it’s activities.
Profits will be spent to support growth, local initiatives focusing on the preservation of nature, the production of low impact, quality foods and the information and sensibilisation of both the local community and visitors on the subject of low impact living, self sustainability, community networking and general health.


To achieve this income , Liveloula aims primarily at becoming the main vegetable supplier for our friends and neighbors at Re-Green.  Re-green hosts beautiful seminars and workshops for groups sometimes over 30 people.   Our dream is to provide quality organically grown food for groups this big and for ourselves.  Our all natural way of farming shuns mechanical devices, therefore farming becomes a fun and dynamic hands on experience for big groups of people.  Did we mention working the soil is healthy for body and mind?Second, Liveloula will be offering a broad set of quality products ranging from home pharmacy to jewelry to homegrown organic foods.So far, Liveloula has been privately funded, yet to make a good start, we are hoping for your support.   Small and bigger donations can be made to help us further install a good infrastructure.  With a better infrastructure we hope to be able to host more volunteers for a longer period of time or attract new residents, allowing Liveloula to make a bigger impact.

We are aiming at a cost of approximately 5000 euros.  A brief summation of what this money will be spend on:. roughly 400 on the stones for a foundation. about 400 on construction sand, lime and marble sand. at least 100 on straw bales. around 2500 on FSC construction woods. not more than 400 on roof tiles. some 400 on windows and a door. about 500 for a solar/ rocket stove water installation

<h3>hello!</h3>
<p>If you don't know me already, my name is Christi, and Scraps is my new business (yay!). Scraps embodies some key things that define my life:</p>
<ul>
<li>sustainability</li>
<li>bicycles</li>
<li>scrappiness!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here's a bit more about where Scraps came from, <a href=""https://scrapsmilehigh.com/about-us/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">taken from the new Scraps website</a>:</strong></p>​<strong style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'><i>""Why can't I compost here?""</i> </strong><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>That's the frustration that started this. </span><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>I was living in a condominium, and that meant I couldn't do anything with my food scraps but throw them in the trash. That's because Denver's compost collection program doesn't extend to multi-family buildings, meaning that none of the condominiums and apartment buildings in Denver with more than seven units - and they are popping up <i>everywhere </i>- are able to compost. </span><p><br/>Somehow I convinced my boyfriend to let me collect our food scraps under the sink anyhow (in a nice compost pail, of course). Then, every so often, I'd tie the full bucket up tight in a thick plastic bag and gingerly transport it across town (in a nice car that didn't belong to me - you can see how untenable this is) to my friend's house, where he could compost in his backyard. Obviously that wasn't a stellar long-term solution. And maybe I sometimes ""waited too long"" to transport the food scraps... Let's just say the BF and I are now just friends.</p>
<p>The long-term solution: an ""ah-ha"" moment in which I decided to solve my own problem, followed by many months of consternation, research, excitement, fear, and finally - Scraps!</p>
<p>Several things you might be interested to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>I love bicycles and all things pedal-powered. My bicycle has a name.</li>
<li>I cannot stand waste, or wastefulness, or thoughtless consumerism.</li>
<li>I am a minimalist with a tiny house obsession.</li>
<li>I've worked in sustainability and sustainable community development throughout my career.</li>
<li>I lived nearly seven years in Madagascar, and was inspired by, among other things, the incredible ingenuity (and scrappiness!) of my community.</li>
<li>I'm a writer, photographer &amp; filmmaker. I believe in the power of media for social change.</li>
<li>I am constantly inspired to do more with less &amp; firmly believe that less is more. </li>
<li>I love Denver. I care deeply about its sustainable urban development, and want to be a (small) part of that.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This is the foundation upon which Scraps rests.</strong> I hope you'll join me in keeping more compostables out of our landfill and turning them them back into something useful!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>how Scraps works.</h3>
<p>Scraps is a new company with a new concept for the Mile High City: food scraps pick-up for multi-tenant buildings. On bikes!</p>
<p><strong>Scraps is scrappy.</strong> We're a low-carbon, bicycle-based, flexible &amp; local solution, tailored to multi-family housing. We use locally manufactured “bicycle vehicles” to pick up food scraps from multi-tenant building customers and transport the food scraps to collection points - large compost dumpsters - that are already part of existing commercial compost pick-up routes, simply adding to the load that trucks already haul out to the regional compost processing facility. <b>(This is possible thanks to the collaboration of <a href=""http://alpinewaste.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alpine Waste</a> and some of their commercial compost customers, who understand our passion - THANK YOU!)</b></p>
<p>We’ll provide everything a building and its tenants need to keep their food scraps &amp; other compostable items out of the landfill: countertop bins, compostable baggies, large bins for on-site collection, large compostable bin liners, and a regularly scheduled bicycle pick-up to haul away the collected food scraps. And we’ll do it with no mess, no trucks &amp; a completely personalized service. <strong>(The bags and bins are being provided free of charge by <a href=""http://biobagusa.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">BioBag </a>for the initial phase of this endeavor - THANK YOU!)</strong></p>
<p>We'll even do this for other customers - small restaurants, for example - and we're already gearing up to do some zero-waste events and festivals. <strong>But our main focus is to provide a compostables pick-up solution to multi-family buildings. </strong></p>
<p>We're also creating a ""Scraps Rewards"" program, in which Scraps customers can use their membership cards for discounts and freebies at local businesses. It's one of the ways we're trying to give folks for whom composting isn't a natural ""YES"" more and more reasons to sign up - like free beers at the local tap room, discounted tickets to the game, free drip coffee at the local cafe, etc.</p>
<h3>
<br/>the challenges.</h3>
<p>There's a reason traditional waste haulers don't service multi-family buildings: it's hard! That's due to a whole host of reasons that Scraps is designed to solve - like where to put compost bins, how to price a service that customers will invest in, how to keep costs low, how to get in and out of tight spaces in big multi-family buildings, how to make the idea and the act of saving compostable material more palatable to more people, etc.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>how you can help.</h3>
<p>To get up and pedaling strong, Scraps needs your support. We'll use it:</p>
<ul>
<li>to purchase two new bicycles - also called ""pedal-trikes,"" ""pedal-trucks"" or ""bicycle-vehicles"" - for Scraps</li>
<li>to defray the costs of renting a garage/office space for Scraps</li>
<li>to purchase 50 new 23-gallon bins, for on-site food scraps storage</li>
<li>to purchase several cases of bin liners for the bins</li>
<li>to purchase other equipment, such as heavy-duty scales, for each Scraps pedal-truck</li>
<li>to defray the cost of online marketing &amp; software needs (e.g., web hosting, pay portal)</li>
<li>to purchase marketing materials such as business cards, stickers, decals, flyers &amp; signs</li>
</ul>
<p>...and more!<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Scraps will make an impact!</h3>
<p>Our bike-powered compost collection model is one of very few in the U.S., and the only one we know of that is focusing on serving multi-family buildings. With your support, and the support of our partners and collaborators, you can help us create a model that works our Mile High City, and that can be shared with other dense urban areas across the country!

<li>You'll support a <strong>local, woman-owned business</strong> working with a <strong>local manufacturer </strong>and other local partners.</li>
<li>You'll help close the loop on food waste, and help turn food back into soil instead of sending it to the landfill forever.</li>
<li>You'll support small-scale, cross-sector innovations in response to some of our greatest urban sustainability challenges.</li>

</p><p>OUR STORY</p>
<p>Hive to Hearth started in late fall 2012 when a small group
of wild honeybees made their hive in the eaves about the bay window of my
home.  They didn't survive and the hive was removed.  After
spending the winter doing research on raising bees, and the best type
of hive, the apiary was started with the building of a top bar beehive. 
The bees were ordered from a local bee farm and released into the new
hive.  Since then the apiary has taken off slowly, but it is growing on 12
acres in central Texas.<span>  January 2015 our
story changed.  </span>January 14, 2015 my wife had an ultrasound-assisted biopsy preformed on
her right breast.  This was just a day before our 11th wedding
anniversary.<span> <span>  She was diagnosed with </span>invasive ductal
carcinoma on January 19, 2015.  Although
we are through with treatment, we have changed what and how we eat.  One thing that we noticed was the lack of
quality vegetables in the market at a reasonable price, and the not knowing
where or how the fish that we ate was grown. 
Because of this I have started an aquaponics system on my patio, and
have enjoyed good success with the lettuce and other leafy greens that are
growing in it.</span></p>
<p>OUR Mission</p>
<p>Hive to Hearth is looking to set-up our 12-acre farm to provide
organically and sustainably grown fruits and vegetables to offer to the local
communities in central Texas. I believe that to be healthy you have to eat healthy.<span>  To do this means to dedicate ourselves in
growing organically in greenhouses with aquaponics systems.  Our goal is to get at least one greenhouse
setup on the farm to start up the larger aquaponics systems with the hope of
having two full time running greenhouses producing fish, vegetables and fruit
for the local markets.  A third one will
be used to give to the local soup kitchens and food pantries, as everyone
should be able to eat healthy.</span></p>
<p>Why we need you</p>
<p>Your help will allow us to see this dream come true: to be able
to help the folks in the communities eat healthy and be healthy.<span>  You donations and support will allow us to
purchase the greenhouse and the various materials needed to set up the
aquaponics systems and grow the fish, fruits and vegetables.</span></p>
<p>Breakdown of the funding:</p>
<p>Greenhouse: 50%</p>
<p>Tanks: 15%</p>
<p>Grow beds: 10%</p>
<p>Pumps: 10%</p>
<p>Piping: 5%</p>
<p>Miscellaneous (lumber/building supplies, fish, seeds):<span>  10%</span></p>
<p>Other ways you can help</p>
<p>Beyond giving, you can help by getting the word out.<span>  Let your friends and family know about our
farm and our goals.</span></p>

hive.  Since then the apiary has taken off slowly, but it is growing on 12
acres in central Texas.  January 2015 our
story changed.  January 14, 2015 my wife had an ultrasound-assisted biopsy preformed on
her right breast.  This was just a day before our 11th wedding
anniversary.   She was diagnosed with invasive ductal
carcinoma on January 19, 2015.  Although
we are through with treatment, we have changed what and how we eat.  One thing that we noticed was the lack of
quality vegetables in the market at a reasonable price, and the not knowing
where or how the fish that we ate was grown. 
Because of this I have started an aquaponics system on my patio, and
have enjoyed good success with the lettuce and other leafy greens that are
growing in it.
OUR Mission
Hive to Hearth is looking to set-up our 12-acre farm to provide
organically and sustainably grown fruits and vegetables to offer to the local
communities in central Texas. I believe that to be healthy you have to eat healthy.  To do this means to dedicate ourselves in
growing organically in greenhouses with aquaponics systems.  Our goal is to get at least one greenhouse
setup on the farm to start up the larger aquaponics systems with the hope of
having two full time running greenhouses producing fish, vegetables and fruit
for the local markets.  A third one will
be used to give to the local soup kitchens and food pantries, as everyone
should be able to eat healthy.
Why we need you
Your help will allow us to see this dream come true: to be able
to help the folks in the communities eat healthy and be healthy.  You donations and support will allow us to
purchase the greenhouse and the various materials needed to set up the
aquaponics systems and grow the fish, fruits and vegetables.
Breakdown of the funding:
Greenhouse: 50%
Tanks: 15%
Grow beds: 10%
Pumps: 10%
Piping: 5%
Miscellaneous (lumber/building supplies, fish, seeds):  10%
Other ways you can help
Beyond giving, you can help by getting the word out.  Let your friends and family know about our
farm and our goals.

<p><b>Who are we:</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Bycatch Brewery is
operated by Bradley Craig and Dano Ferons. Now you are probably wondering,
“What is Bycatch?” Bycatch is a term used in commercial fishing that refers to
the unwanted fish and other marine organism accidentally captured by fishermen
targeting other species. Brad and Dano both received their master’s degrees in
Coastal Marine and Wetland Studies from Coastal Carolina University. While
studying at CCU Brad and Dano began brewing beer together. </p>
<p> Brad is a mountain man from Tennessee. He and
his wife Miranda moved to the Grand Strand so that Brad could get his master’s
degree in marine geology. However, the rugged mountain lifestyle never left
him. It is made evident by his groomed facial hair and quiet demeanor.</p>
<p>Dano is from
California and moved to the Grand Strand to study mercury in fish. He surfs,
dives, fishes, and can talk for hours on end. With an easy laugh and hard work
ethic he never stops moving and working but if you pull up for a pint he will
be there with a smile.</p>
<p>This campaign
has been set up to help fund the brewery as well as garner interest in local
brewing within South Carolina. By donating to this brewery you will help to establish
the first brewery in Conway, South Carolina. Conway is a historic town built
along the Waccamaw River inland of Myrtle Beach and the Grand Strand. The
addition of a brewery to this town will help to establish a center to gather
the community. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What we need:</b></p>
<p>We need your
help to begin purchasing our equipment. We will use the funds to purchase a 3.5
BBL brewhouse from Systech Stainless Works. This brewhouse will include our
mash/lauter tun, boil kettle, hot lauter tun, cold liquor tank, pumps, and hoses.
Additionally, we will be using the funds to purchase our fermenters, bright
tanks, and kegs. Everything we need to brew delicious beer and serve it to you.</p>
<p>If we do not
reach our funding goal we will be using the funds to purchase as much of our
brewing equipment as possible. </p>
<p><b>What you get:</b></p>

Rep Us - $15 #:Infinite</p>
<p>Since you are
helping us start our brewery we think you deserve two stickers. These stickers

and a one of a kind handwritten thank you note.</p>
<p>Sweatshirt -

for your effort?</p>
<p>Catch and Keep -

<p>All fishers have
a secret spot that only they know about. You know the one I am talking about.
It’s next to the tenth pier piling on the south side of that one pier. Well
unlike that secret spot this one is not so secret because your name is going to
be emblazoned on one of our bar stools. Additionally, you will have your own
“Tackle Box” to go with it.</p>
<p> Conodont Club - $1,000 #: 20</p>

<p>Captain for a
Day - $5,000 #: 5</p>

to run a ship for a day. Just imagine sailing the sea with no care in the world

at the brewery. Contact us for more information</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp;
Challenges</b></p>
<p>We here at
Bycatch know that any endeavor comes with risks and challenges, just like every
time you go out in to marsh.  Planning ahead may keep you out of the pluff
mud and double checking that your equipment is in working order is a must. As
scientists, we have learned that Murphy’s Law rarely overcomes good planning.
Years of research experience have taught us that when we do something wrong, we
can look at what we did and make adjustments without being too headstrong.
Thanks to years our professional backgrounds in the field, classroom, and lab,
we know how to stop, breathe, and then attack the issue head on with a well
thought-out plan to fix what ever comes our way.  Some of the risks we
face here in coastal South Carolina are competing with larger beer companies
and other regional brewers. We hope to make a name for ourselves in this
competitive market by having a unique branding and loyal customer base who
value delicious craft beer, as well as our coastal environment. Using great
marketing and even better beer, we will provide the beer that our locals and
tourist want to drink while enjoying the wonderful beaches, fishing, surfing,
and any of the numerous activities that are available near Conway, SC. </p>

<p>Hi everyone, <br/>My Name is Tom &amp; I'm a small business owner that's been Selling for a good few years now. I've built up a stable customer fan base, selling an array of products from jewellery, keepsake cake toppers, Notebooks; art prints just to name a few things. </p>
<p><br/>The business is run by just me myself and I in my Essex based studio.</p>
<p><strong>What's happened</strong> </p>
<p>I recently Have become aware of a massive issue with my existing laser machine, <br/>Which is the ""The Heart of my work"" its failing it's coming to the end of its life and I'm simply being strangled and limited to the amount of work I can do,</p>
<p>before long with Festive season to think about ""I know but as a small business you have to think ahead"" But (<strong>without it I can't run my beloved business </strong>and to continue to make an income or generate new custom or make new products.</p>
<p>The machine is basically on its last legs &amp; its what provides my wonderful customers with the work they Send my way.</p>
<p>Along with this i have Huge restrictions with bed size; I literally have to turn away work because I only have enough room to make not so bigger projects. </p>
<p><strong>In return for all your help and going forward </strong></p>
<p>I'm offering perks for all of you in return for your generosity; I wouldn't ever expect anyone to give something without getting at least something back in return no matter how small it maybe.</p>
<p>So you see without my machine, I basically have nothing and no income at all. <br/>without your help and support, <br/>From friends, customers &amp; family your contributions will enable me to put a deposit on a newer better machine,<br/>better software more room for more design ideas &amp; the ability to generate an income without the worry of it coming to an abrupt halt. </p>
<p>The cost for my new or ex demo machine is between £8000-10000 so any help will enable me to put a deposit down on another or sort out some form of monthly payment plan. I've already raised a bit of money myself but it's no where near what I will need.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>if I don't make my goal: </strong></p>
<p>If my goal isn't reached then what ever money is raised, shall go towards much needed expenses to help towards refurbishing my existing machine.</p>
<p><br/>I understand how tough times are for many and that you mightn't be able to help, but what I will be eternally thankful for is if you could help share this donation page to help spread the word.</p>
<p>So without my customers and the work they bring to me I wouldn't be here today, it's because of all of you my friends, family and my customers that I am able to do what I love and enjoy for all of you every day.</p>
<p>Thank you &amp; I hope you can help in any way you can. </p>

<p>Our goal is to build a successful commercial cultivation facility and create a recognizable brand in a rapidly growing industry. High Tides is a new company with a goal of bringing seed to sale quality into the cannabis cultivation market, starting with one greenhouse in California. This is where you come in.</p>
<p>First you may ask, what is seed to sale. That means from the first sprout until finished product there is an unbroken chain of care. Everything is grown by us, harvested, cured, produced and sold in such a way that we can guarantee you are getting the best possible product. By maintaining  high standards through each of our steps we can promise that every dose is the highest consistent quality. </p>
<p>Many large groups are buying up land for mass production.  When this happens quality and attention to detail get sacrificed in pursuit of quantity.  This also means that the resulting crop is inconsistent which in turn means an inferior product</p>
<p>Our passion is to create potent, consistent product. To do this we will open a greenhouse and grow in  controlled hydroponic and organic conditions.</p>
<p>The passage of initiatives in California, Nevada, Massachusetts, Maine, Florida, Arkansas, Montana, and North Dakota will add $7.4 billion to the 2020 market forecast bringing the overall market projection for legal adult-use and medical sales in the U.S. to $22.8 billion by 2020. </p>
<p>We believe that the people spending that money into our industry should never receive substandard product, in whatever form they choose to use it. Which is why what we are doing is so important. By starting at seed, growing, producing and selling ourselves we can guarantee every aspect of the product's quality.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So where will your money go? We are asking for $20,000 to begin our grow. Our goal is to launch our operation in January of 2018 and to be providing product in the early spring of 2018.<br/><br/>We have grow land and an experienced grower with a specialty in in organic hydroponics. We have a production space and a certified pastry chef to whip up amazing edibles.<br/><br/>What we need: Water tanks, greenhouse materials, plants, licensing, solar kit, water and a humble homestead (travel trailer) for our grower.<br/><br/>In return for your support we offer awesome and unique swag as well as coupons for those in state for free product!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Impact Our hope is to provide people with quality product while setting a standard within the industry that proves that seed to sale is viable and better for customers.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Given the federal view on cannabis, working in this field comes with inherent risks. However, we are following state and local guidelines to the letter. We are open and honest about our growing processes with the intent to sell the product as opposed to executing a co-op grow. All of our products will be grown, produced and sold according to state and local cannabis guidelines. Thank you so much for reading through the details of our business and for considering an investment in making High Tides a reality! We hope you will agree that we have a clear vision that's complimented by a sound business plan that's worthy of your support.</p>

<h3>Learn more about Worker Owned Cooperatives</h3>
<p>Below you'll find more information about Worker Owned Cooperatives, as borrowed from the United States Federation of Worker Cooperatives:</p>
<p>Worker cooperatives are business entities that are owned and controlled by their members, the people who work in them.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits</strong><br/>Cooperatives are the only form of business centered around membership, and member and community benefit is at the core of the cooperative model. Worker cooperative businesses are owned and run by their members, the people who work in them, and they operate for the benefit of these members.</p>
<p>The member benefits are multiple. A cooperative can be a way for people to start and own a small business together when they may lack the means or expertise to do so alone. Worker cooperative members can build assets in their cooperative business by retaining surplus every year in individual capital accounts. In a worker cooperative, workers own their jobs, so they decide how they are treated and how they want to operate the business. Worker-owners also get a lot of practice making decisions, building their skills in a variety of areas, and participating democratically in a process to benefit the larger group. These are the skills and habits of engaged community members, and they don’t stop at the workplace: you will often find worker-owners involved in the community in other ways.</p>
<p>Community benefits are clear too. Successful worker cooperatives tend to create long-term stable jobs, enact sustainable business practices, and develop linkages among different parts of the social economy. Worker-owned businesses have not only a direct stake in the local environment but the power to decide to do business in a way that is sustainable for us all. The worker cooperative movement is increasingly recognized as part of the larger movement for sustainability and a new economy based on people’s needs.</p>
<p>Cooperatives have a long history as a way for working people to create good, dignified jobs that they control, particularly for people who lack access to business ownership or even stable work options.  Organizations undertaking economic development to build wealth in poor communities and communities of color have used worker cooperatives as a powerful vehicle for addressing economic inequality. Worker cooperatives have been shown to provide better working conditions and wages for typically low-wage work, and to increase household wealth for low-income workers. Worker cooperatives can also play an important role in building movements for economic justice and social change. As institutions where real democracy is practiced on a day to day basis, they are a model for the empowerment we will need to create the change we envision. As economic engines, they meet material needs, anchoring capital and jobs in communities.</p>
<p><u>Values</u><br/>Co-operatives are based on the values of self-help, self-responsibility, democracy, equality, equity and solidarity. In the tradition of their founders, co-operative members believe in the ethical values of honesty, openness, social responsibility and caring for others.</p>

<h3>
<b>WHY ARE WE RAISING MONEY?</b> <br/>
</h3><p>- Since 1996 Seven Seeds Farm (<a href=""http://www.sevenseedsfarm.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.sevenseedsfarm.com</a>) has been busy farming and building our seed bank for decades, and now Siskiyou Seeds (<a href=""http://www.siskiyouseeds.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.siskiyouseeds.com</a>)is growing our business to better support gardeners and farmers with high quality, organic, open-pollinated, non-GMO seeds adapted to organic conditions and the stresses of climate change.  We are also expanding our ability at training new farmers, seed stewards and plant breeders - a task we have
been deeply engaged in here at Siskiyou Seeds. <b>Your contributions directly support organic seed growers, family farms, open source plant breeders and aspiring young farmers.</b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467067221/1412439_1425916647712404_9026219905937980333_o_chmich.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 362.667px;height: 272px;""/></p><p> <b>OUR STORY: </b>Seeds are a
gift from nature – they help facilitate the continuance of life.  Most of our food crops come from seed and we
believe that it is a resource that should be stewarded, open source within the
commons, rather than privatized or controlled. 
Siskiyou Seeds is our family farm’s humble effort to contribute to a
positive solution. We grow high quality, certified
organic seed that we have distributed nationwide.  In 2009 we initiated our own retail seed
packet business.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467319648/strawb_luxdox.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>  Today we
steward a collection of nearly 600 open pollinated vegetables, flowers and
herbs grown on 5 acres here and from the support of 15 organic growers in the
Pacific Northwest.  We are fortunate to
have many wonderful heirlooms and unique cultivars.  We continue to breed new varieties and select
old favorites to perform well amidst a changing climate.  We believe that well selected and adapted seeds
are likely one of the best tools that we have to foster resilient agriculture
now and in coming times.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467321858/IMG_0054_u40whv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>  The task of
growing a wide diversity of seed on scale is immense – from maintaining the
appropriate isolation distances, to protecting seed crops from pests, to
harvesting it in a timely way, to cleaning and storing the seed, to germination
testing. There are many steps that result in quality seeds to share.  We are passionate about growing good seed to
foster the Agrarian Renaissance among those who wish to reclaim our food systems for the health of ourselves, our
families and the larger circle of life.  
The biennial Seed Academy at Seven Seeds Farm is an intensive 5-day, on-farm training that aims
to educate, empower and inspire a new generation of seed stewards. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467069582/IMG_0207_tracfn.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 444.994px;height: 334px;""/></p>
<p>We are asking for support to bring our small family farm
Seed Company to a new level of production, consistency, reliability and
community involvement.  Currently we are
the primary seed company within the Southern Oregon / Northern California
region.  We aim to invest in the people,

- Since 1996 Seven Seeds Farm (www.sevenseedsfarm.com) has been busy farming and building our seed bank for decades, and now Siskiyou Seeds (www.siskiyouseeds.com)is growing our business to better support gardeners and farmers with high quality, organic, open-pollinated, non-GMO seeds adapted to organic conditions and the stresses of climate change.  We are also expanding our ability at training new farmers, seed stewards and plant breeders - a task we have
been deeply engaged in here at Siskiyou Seeds. Your contributions directly support organic seed growers, family farms, open source plant breeders and aspiring young farmers. OUR STORY: Seeds are a
gift from nature – they help facilitate the continuance of life.  Most of our food crops come from seed and we
believe that it is a resource that should be stewarded, open source within the
commons, rather than privatized or controlled. 
Siskiyou Seeds is our family farm’s humble effort to contribute to a
positive solution. We grow high quality, certified
organic seed that we have distributed nationwide.  In 2009 we initiated our own retail seed
packet business.
  Today we
steward a collection of nearly 600 open pollinated vegetables, flowers and
herbs grown on 5 acres here and from the support of 15 organic growers in the
Pacific Northwest.  We are fortunate to
have many wonderful heirlooms and unique cultivars.  We continue to breed new varieties and select
old favorites to perform well amidst a changing climate.  We believe that well selected and adapted seeds
are likely one of the best tools that we have to foster resilient agriculture
now and in coming times.
  The task of
growing a wide diversity of seed on scale is immense – from maintaining the
appropriate isolation distances, to protecting seed crops from pests, to
harvesting it in a timely way, to cleaning and storing the seed, to germination
testing. There are many steps that result in quality seeds to share.  We are passionate about growing good seed to
foster the Agrarian Renaissance among those who wish to reclaim our food systems for the health of ourselves, our
families and the larger circle of life.  
The biennial Seed Academy at Seven Seeds Farm is an intensive 5-day, on-farm training that aims
to educate, empower and inspire a new generation of seed stewards. 
We are asking for support to bring our small family farm
Seed Company to a new level of production, consistency, reliability and
community involvement.  Currently we are
the primary seed company within the Southern Oregon / Northern California
region.  We aim to invest in the people,
plants and infrastructure to foster healthy businesses that bridge biology and
culture through seed. We are implementing the following stages that will accelerated  through the success of this funding campaign 
• Upgrade our seed germination testing equipment to
accurately test seed 
• Research and development for quality control and new
products
• Offer regular public field days at the farm and in the
region to showcase the seed to table attributes of current and new seeds
•. We are upgrading our seed inventory management systems.
• Create a backup power system for our climate controlled seed
storage room.
• Provide scholarships to our Seed education trainings.Thank you for making the effort to support growing a world of good and a positive future.Pictured Below is our seed packets and the Organic cotton hoodie with the Siskiyou Seeds Logo on the front and a beautiful Seven Seeds Farm image on the back (both available as a perks)Partners in our effort include:",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

THIS IS YOUR FINAL CHANCE TO GET THE CHEAPEST WAY TO ROAM AT SUCH AMAZING RATES! </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471327803/Interfone_USPs_gxspjc.png"" src="""" style=""background-color: initial;""/><br/></p><p><b></b></p>
<p>●<span> 
</span>Brief description of the campaign and why it's important to me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hi! I'm Anton Colton, Head of Marketing and Sales at Interfone. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Today, I embark on a new exciting project - the ROAM LIKE HOME Interfone SIM Sticker!</span></p><p>As a frequent traveller, it was difficult communicating with
colleagues around the world and providing real-time updates to key agencies and
customers. I required constant connectivity via calls and data, especially in a
constantly connected world It is frustrating that when overseas, we would have
to cut down on the likes of Facebook, email or WhatsApp to lower data usage. </p>
<p>Though, the most frustrating part about being on the go is
the inability to keep in touch with my colleagues, family and friends,
especially when we are in different timezones. When you are halfway around the
world and 15 hours apart, there is a small window where everyone is awake.
Those important moments can be missed due to the prohibitive high cost of
overseas calls and roaming data usage.</p>
<p>The existing options were extremely disappointing. First, I
was frustrated with buying local SIM cards everywhere. While it was cheaper, it
was not ideal to keep track of so many of them. Second, I couldn't keep my
local number, having to always hope the recipient will answer my calls or not
being able to log in to my apps. Third, paying for roaming was too expensive,
many a times to return home to find a colossal bill waiting for me. </p>
<p>That's why Interfone launched the SIM sticker: A convenient,
affordable, and game-changing 0.5mm sticker placed on any micro-SIM (Apple /
Android) that retains your number when overseas that can drastically reduce
international roaming charges!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471328152/Interfone_SIM_Sticker_x8d7gu.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>It is the easiest way to stay connected. Save on roaming
with Interfone's SIM Sticker. Never change your SIM card again! The sticker
requires only a one-time installation and comes with an accompanying
easy-to-use app to make calls or use the Internet.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471328991/interfone-image-3-1400x1400_kmcavv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

<p>Having researched and developed this technology over the
last two years, we are now looking for public support to make it better. You
are the key to setting off the next global revolution in mobile communications.
</p>
<p>Besides getting an opportunity to make overseas calls and
data cheaper, contributors to the campaign will also stress test our system. We
have individually tested the SIM Sticker on SIM cards in 54 countries:</p>

<p></p>
<p>With the SIM Sticker, we have been able to roam in almost
100 countries, now I need your help to try it at scale. </p>
<p>If we can get just 1,000 SIM stickers up and running at the
end, we will have enough data to streamline the service even more. This will
prove to the world that no one should just accept existing troublesome roaming
solutions anymore. Together, the <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Interfone SIM sticker will have enough momentum to expand to
even more countries to help more people stay connected.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p> Why my project is valuable to you and to the world.</p>
<h3><b>Save up to 90% on roaming</b></h3>
<p>With international roaming calls for as low as $0.50/min, you can reduce your roaming costs by up to 90%. Enjoy the same low rates when you make international calls from your home country.</p>
<h3><b>Embedded SIM &amp; number</b></h3>
<p>With the Interfone Sim card, you can travel anywhere, call &amp; surf the web with just one universal SIM!</p>
<h3><b>Pay-per-Use</b></h3>
<p>Pay only for what you use, with no monthly subscription, no minimum monthly usage or contract.</p>
<h3><b>Convenience</b></h3>
<p>Skip the hassle of purchasing local SIM card overseas or hold multiple SIM cards for different countries with just one Interfone chip.</p>
<h3><b>Stay on your mobile plan</b></h3>
<p>Enjoy the best of both worlds – your home operator for local calls and Interfone chip when abroad and for international calls.</p>
<h3><b>Global Impact</b></h3>
<p>The first step to changing the world, is to change oneself. More converts to Interfone SIM Sticker instead of the alternatives will lead to more people accepting the inevitable change towards technology that betters our travel experience.</p>
<br/><p></p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We are hoping to raise $25,000USD in this campaign. It is
quite an ambitious goal for us, though it is necessary considering the goal of
disrupting local pre-paid SIM cards and more. The funds raised will be put
towards marketing efforts to get the word out to a global audience. It will
take considerable effort to convince frequent travellers to change their usual
routines (i.e. overpaying for roaming). </p>
<p>As the target audience is global, the
bulk of the funds will be spent on online marketing. First, through search
engine optimisation (SEO) to get a global audience who are searching keywords
to visit our site. Second, will be spent on advertising on social media to get
more viral sharing, if possible. Lastly, public relations will be needed to
educate a wider audience on Interfone SIM Sticker's simpler alternative.</p>

<br/><p><b>Where the funds go if I don't reach my entire goal</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>As this campaign is on a flexible funding
scheme, even if we do not get to the goal, we will honour the perks as
promised. The key goal of this crowdfunding campaign is to get SIM Stickers
into your hands to help you out and help us be better. Increasing users of the
SIM Sticker by 1, 100 or 999 will help me understand more about travellers and
mobile call/data consumption to improve the product and service. I personally
guarantee that there will be the best support for users regardless of funds
raised.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>My successful track record with projects like this</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">
<p>I personally have spent quite some time in the
telecommunications industry so I am confident that our Interfone SIM Sticker
works and with your help, will be successful. </p>
<p>My previous corporate role was
the Head of Campaigns at O2 in the UK. I led the launch of SMB Digital
(Connected Devices), the largest campaign in the history of SMB. The campaign
included TV, radio, online, social and PR. It was awarded the best global
campaign by Microsoft and was a finalist in O2’s annual awards. I've been part
of many great products before but nothing as revolutionary as this.</p>
</span></h4>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Anything worth doing is never going to be easy. The biggest
risk is that our technology is unable to scale as fast as the demand. We expect
that many people be interested to give the Interfone SIM Sticker a try - the
worry is that the volume exceeds our capabilities to service it.</p>
<p>Also, the biggest challenge is that people are too used to
travelling the same way. Advanced technologies sometimes put people off as too
avant-garde. Even after pointing out the benefits outweigh the costs, it often
takes a giant push to get someone to change.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>My qualities to overcome these hurdles</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I have a great team behind me to ensure the technical
aspects of the Interfone SIM Sticker are rock solid. Also, as a seasoned
marketing professional, I see changing consumer behaviour as an exciting
challenge.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>My plan for solving these challenges</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>To prepare for the increase in traffic and requests, the team
and I will be on standby around the clock. Our system is built with excess
redundancy to handle major fluctuations in data usage.</p>
<p>As for consumer mindsets, we plan to keep
communications open on social media channels. My team and I will be more than
willing to openly address any concerns for all to see. I hope that the
transparency coupled with the benefits and publicity will turn even the most
cynical of doubters around.</p>

<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Interfone SIM Sticker is currently
available for SIM cards in 54 countries. I would only offer these goods where
I'm confident of its optimal performance. Hence for all those who are not in
those countries, you can get the Fundamental: USD $10 Rewards only</p>
<p>For those in countries that have not been tested for Home
SIM usage, this fee will ensure they will be first to have the SIM sticker when
Interfone has expanded into that market. Backers of this tier will receive 1 X
Interfone branded travel accessory (luggage tag). </p>
<p>For everyone else, help the revolution when you Share,
Share, and Share!</p>
<p>The more word-of-mouth we can get, the more people will
accept the movement towards providing better communication tools like Interfone
SIM Sticker. Remember to share this campaign with your colleagues, clients,
family and friends. You can do so with the social media links through Indiegogo
so more will able to directly access this page.</p>

● 
Brief description of the campaign and why it's important to me.

Hi! I'm Anton Colton, Head of Marketing and Sales at Interfone. Today, I embark on a new exciting project - the ROAM LIKE HOME Interfone SIM Sticker!As a frequent traveller, it was difficult communicating with
colleagues around the world and providing real-time updates to key agencies and
customers. I required constant connectivity via calls and data, especially in a
constantly connected world It is frustrating that when overseas, we would have
to cut down on the likes of Facebook, email or WhatsApp to lower data usage. 
Though, the most frustrating part about being on the go is
the inability to keep in touch with my colleagues, family and friends,
especially when we are in different timezones. When you are halfway around the
world and 15 hours apart, there is a small window where everyone is awake.
Those important moments can be missed due to the prohibitive high cost of
overseas calls and roaming data usage.
The existing options were extremely disappointing. First, I
was frustrated with buying local SIM cards everywhere. While it was cheaper, it
was not ideal to keep track of so many of them. Second, I couldn't keep my
local number, having to always hope the recipient will answer my calls or not
being able to log in to my apps. Third, paying for roaming was too expensive,
many a times to return home to find a colossal bill waiting for me. 
That's why Interfone launched the SIM sticker: A convenient,
affordable, and game-changing 0.5mm sticker placed on any micro-SIM (Apple /
Android) that retains your number when overseas that can drastically reduce
international roaming charges!It is the easiest way to stay connected. Save on roaming
with Interfone's SIM Sticker. Never change your SIM card again! The sticker
requires only a one-time installation and comes with an accompanying
easy-to-use app to make calls or use the Internet.
 It'll connect
you to the best local networks in almost 100 countries, when you make calls,
texts or use data roaming with our high-quality and cost effective services.Featured on the following media outlets:

INDIEGOGO IS THE ONLY PLATFORM WHERE ANYONE CAN GET THESE DEALS!
The magnitude of what contributors will help me achieve


Having researched and developed this technology over the
last two years, we are now looking for public support to make it better. You
are the key to setting off the next global revolution in mobile communications.

Besides getting an opportunity to make overseas calls and
data cheaper, contributors to the campaign will also stress test our system. We
have individually tested the SIM Sticker on SIM cards in 54 countries:
Argentina /Australia / Austria / Bahrain / Belgium / Brazil / Bulgaria / Canada / Chile / China / Cyprus / Czech Republic / Denmark / Dominican Republic / El Salvador / Estonia / Finland / France / Germany / Greece / Hong Kong / Hungary / India / Indonesia / Ireland / Israel / Italy / Japan / Korea / Latvia / Lithuania / Luxembourg / Malaysia / Mexico / Netherlands / New Zealand / Norway / Peru / Poland / Portugal / Puerto Rico / Romania / Russia / Singapore / Slovakia / Slovenia / South Africa / Spain / Sweden / Switzerland / Thailand / Turkey / United Kingdom / USA

With the SIM Sticker, we have been able to roam in almost
100 countries, now I need your help to try it at scale. 
If we can get just 1,000 SIM stickers up and running at the
end, we will have enough data to streamline the service even more. This will
prove to the world that no one should just accept existing troublesome roaming
solutions anymore. Together, the Interfone SIM sticker will have enough momentum to expand to
even more countries to help more people stay connected.

The Impact
 Why my project is valuable to you and to the world.
Save up to 90% on roaming
With international roaming calls for as low as $0.50/min, you can reduce your roaming costs by up to 90%. Enjoy the same low rates when you make international calls from your home country.
Embedded SIM & number
With the Interfone Sim card, you can travel anywhere, call & surf the web with just one universal SIM!
Pay-per-Use
Pay only for what you use, with no monthly subscription, no minimum monthly usage or contract.
Convenience
Skip the hassle of purchasing local SIM card overseas or hold multiple SIM cards for different countries with just one Interfone chip.
Stay on your mobile plan
Enjoy the best of both worlds – your home operator for local calls and Interfone chip when abroad and for international calls.
Global Impact
The first step to changing the world, is to change oneself. More converts to Interfone SIM Sticker instead of the alternatives will lead to more people accepting the inevitable change towards technology that betters our travel experience.

What We Need & What You Get




We are hoping to raise $25,000USD in this campaign. It is
quite an ambitious goal for us, though it is necessary considering the goal of
disrupting local pre-paid SIM cards and more. The funds raised will be put
towards marketing efforts to get the word out to a global audience. It will
take considerable effort to convince frequent travellers to change their usual
routines (i.e. overpaying for roaming). 
As the target audience is global, the
bulk of the funds will be spent on online marketing. First, through search
engine optimisation (SEO) to get a global audience who are searching keywords
to visit our site. Second, will be spent on advertising on social media to get
more viral sharing, if possible. Lastly, public relations will be needed to
educate a wider audience on Interfone SIM Sticker's simpler alternative.






After receiving the Interfone SIM Sticker, there is a one-time Installation:



You’re almost ready to roam!
To set up your device, follow these steps before your flight:
1. DOWNLOAD THE MY INTERFONE APP


2. SWITCH TO ‘AWAY’ MODE

Sign in to the My Interfone App with your account details.

3. CHANGE YOUR MOBILE SETTINGS
To enable data roaming while you’re away, always remember to
(i)  Change your APN settings 
(ii)  Enable your mobile data and data roaming 
To do this, please follow these steps:
iOS:
> Mobile Data
> Enable Mobile Data
> Mobile Data Options
> Enable Data Roaming
> Select Mobile data Network
> Change APN to <Interfone> (case sensitive), leaving the username & password field empty.
Android:
> Settings
> Mobile Networks
> Access Point Names
> Add
> Change name and APN to <Interfone> (case sensitive)
4. ACTIVATE YOUR DATA ROAMING
To activate your data or buy a package in ‘AWAY’ mode, select ‘Activate Data’ on the My Interfone App. 
·  If you have a Wi-Fi connection, follow the instructions on the App.
·  If you do not have a Wi-Fi connection, you’ll receive an SMS from us with step-by-step instructions on how to buy or activate your data package.
Alternatively you can activate your data or buy a package in ‘HOME’ mode before travelling. All you need to do is make sure that you have a data connection, and then remember to switch to ‘AWAY’ mode when travelling to enable data roaming and start using the package.

Where the funds go if I don't reach my entire goal


As this campaign is on a flexible funding
scheme, even if we do not get to the goal, we will honour the perks as
promised. The key goal of this crowdfunding campaign is to get SIM Stickers
into your hands to help you out and help us be better. Increasing users of the
SIM Sticker by 1, 100 or 999 will help me understand more about travellers and
mobile call/data consumption to improve the product and service. I personally
guarantee that there will be the best support for users regardless of funds
raised.

My successful track record with projects like this



I personally have spent quite some time in the
telecommunications industry so I am confident that our Interfone SIM Sticker
works and with your help, will be successful. 
My previous corporate role was
the Head of Campaigns at O2 in the UK. I led the launch of SMB Digital
(Connected Devices), the largest campaign in the history of SMB. The campaign
included TV, radio, online, social and PR. It was awarded the best global
campaign by Microsoft and was a finalist in O2’s annual awards. I've been part
of many great products before but nothing as revolutionary as this.


Risks & Challenges


Anything worth doing is never going to be easy. The biggest
risk is that our technology is unable to scale as fast as the demand. We expect
that many people be interested to give the Interfone SIM Sticker a try - the
worry is that the volume exceeds our capabilities to service it.
Also, the biggest challenge is that people are too used to
travelling the same way. Advanced technologies sometimes put people off as too
avant-garde. Even after pointing out the benefits outweigh the costs, it often
takes a giant push to get someone to change.



My qualities to overcome these hurdles




I have a great team behind me to ensure the technical
aspects of the Interfone SIM Sticker are rock solid. Also, as a seasoned
marketing professional, I see changing consumer behaviour as an exciting
challenge.

My plan for solving these challenges



To prepare for the increase in traffic and requests, the team
and I will be on standby around the clock. Our system is built with excess
redundancy to handle major fluctuations in data usage.
As for consumer mindsets, we plan to keep
communications open on social media channels. My team and I will be more than
willing to openly address any concerns for all to see. I hope that the
transparency coupled with the benefits and publicity will turn even the most
cynical of doubters around.


For starters, here are our frequently asked questions at the

Other Ways You Can Help


As mentioned earlier, Interfone SIM Sticker is currently
available for SIM cards in 54 countries. I would only offer these goods where
I'm confident of its optimal performance. Hence for all those who are not in
those countries, you can get the Fundamental: USD $10 Rewards only
For those in countries that have not been tested for Home
SIM usage, this fee will ensure they will be first to have the SIM sticker when
Interfone has expanded into that market. Backers of this tier will receive 1 X
Interfone branded travel accessory (luggage tag). 
For everyone else, help the revolution when you Share,
Share, and Share!
The more word-of-mouth we can get, the more people will
accept the movement towards providing better communication tools like Interfone
SIM Sticker. Remember to share this campaign with your colleagues, clients,
family and friends. You can do so with the social media links through Indiegogo
so more will able to directly access this page.

These services include advice, consulting, guidance, education, and support across a wide range of necessary areas: structure, general business, legal, real estate, negotiating, governmental regulations, permits, researching the market, helping with business planning, accounting and others. <strong>These are precisely the services that have historically been out of reach for these entrepreneurs.</strong></p><p>And we are very efficient.

Butler, Ph.D.Distinguished Professor of Minority Entrepreneurship &Award winning author Finally, Hidden Star’s revolutionary new approach is helping reverse the terrible decline in business ownership and entrepreneurship among low-income, disadvantaged, and minorities in the U.S. We are not waiting on government to address income inequality; we are doing it right here, right now.We are a group of experienced entrepreneurs and business owners who want to give back and help everyone succeed.  We know how the system works and we provide great, free help. By improving success and participation rates, we can help these under-privileged entrepreneurs change their lives and their family’s lives for generations.We are already doing great work and getting great results. In fact, one of the ranking experts in the field, Dr. John S. Butler, said Hidden Star is one of the best concepts for minority entrepreneurship he has seen in 50 years! Please watch our video for details on how this works and the great work we are doing. The more donations we get from people like YOU, the more disadvantaged entrepreneurs we can help start a business, hire employees, and pay taxes. That benefits everyone!PERKS!! There are great perks and rewards at various giving levels. You can get books, links, and GIFT CERTIFICATES to Infinite Clothing. They are a minority owned firm that Hidden Star has helped and they make great workout clothing from RECYCLED WATER BOTTLES! It is awesome. (Check out their website at www.infinite.clothing)Hidden Star provides services that improve outcomes for low- income, disadvantaged, and minority entrepreneurs; and dramatically improves their odds of succeeding in their own business. These services include advice, consulting, guidance, education, and support across a wide range of necessary areas: structure, general business, legal, real estate, negotiating, governmental regulations, permits, researching the market, helping with business planning, accounting and others. These are precisely the services that have historically been out of reach for these entrepreneurs.And we are very efficient. Government programs can spend more than $100,000 to create a single job. Hidden Star spends LESS THAN 1% OF THAT to help our entrepreneurs create a job. Amazing!  They can do it, they just need some help.Our unique Pay It Forward With Equity twist means that this will become a self-sustaining fund providing more and more help to more and more deserving entrepreneurs. It is an awesome social good and very powerful. Please help us help them.Whether you donate or not, PLEASE help us spread the word!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Isle of Reefs Tours (IORT) was founded based on my insight into the unique, natural experiences of Carriacou and the other Grenadine Islands. I recognized and embraced the need to promote a unique and environmentally friendly product and to secure the future of this sensitive environment for my two boys and future generations.</p>
<p>Isle of Reefs Tours currently offers boat tours, excursions to the Tobago Cays Marine Park, guided hiking, turtle watching, offshore camping, island tours, carbon offset and local cultural experiences.  Isle of Reefs Tours actively participates in the Grenada Bank Marine Protected Area Network which monitors and manages environmental issues in the Grenadines. We also work with school children to do beach clean ups and to teach about environmental protection as part of our social responsibility. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>In response to growing demands from visitors, for the upcoming season, Isle of Reefs plans to expand its activities by commissioning a second, larger boat and by offering two additional tour products:</p>
<p><strong>Second Boat:</strong> Isle of Reefs Tours has been very successful during its first two years of operation but its activities are now limited by the availability of boat transportation for the various trips that we offer; essentially IORT can only offer one trip per day because it has only one, relatively small boat, but the demand for trips is substantially greater than that. During the past year I had an opportunity to buy a 27 feet fiberglass boat hull at a good price and I used my total savings of US$17,000 to purchase it. The concept is to use the new boat with environmentally friendly engines for the longer trips to the Tobago Cays thereby utilizing my current boat for the shorter trips and the new activities that are outlined below.   In order to commission the second boat we need to have it refitted with two engines, safety equipment, electrical modifications and employ additional boat staff. These items represent the largest part of the cost of the expanded business.</p>
<p><strong>Guided Kayaking Tours: </strong>This tour would offer a serene, meditation like experience into the Tyrell Bay Mangrove and Oyster Bed, an ecologically sensitive breeding ground for numerous land and marine species.  To successfully accomplish this goal we will employ a new tour guide and purchase kayaks and safety equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Citizen Science Tours:</strong>  Guests on these tours would visit various bird watching locations on Carriacou and nearby islands, where they would have the opportunity to observe and record nesting and roosting colonies of resident and migratory seabirds.  This tour has the added benefit of the information collected being submitted to Birds Caribbean, to aid in the protection of these species by monitoring their health and status.  We will need to employ a guide and purchase monitoring equipment such as binoculars and bird identification charts to make this tour a reality.</p>
<p><strong>Monetary commitment to successfully accomplish this expansion:</strong> This expansion of Isle of Reef Tours will cost US$47,000 including the US$17,000 that I have spent on the boat hull over the past year; so we need to raise a further $30,000. The costs breakdown for the $30,000 is shown in our financial explanation chart below.  Consequently, to fulfill our vision of fostering environmental awareness and protection while generating employment, we are seeking your assistance.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will assist us in accomplishing our goals and guarantee success. Most importantly, your vote of confidence, will allow us to provide four local job opportunities while teaching and maintaining respect for the environment. The addition of the new tour experiences will increase Carriacou's Tourist Experience, which provides much needed revenue for restaurants, accommodations, small businesses and taxis on the island.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>In the event that we are unable to achieve our fundraising goal, we will not be able to implement the envisioned tour packages for the upcoming tourist season, as the items listed above are invaluable for the operation of the planned tours. However, if we fall short of funds raised, we will proceed with the same dedication and vigor that we have built this business on. Funds raised by this campaign will be put towards securing as many of the required items as possible and we would work towards having these tours offered as soon as Isle of Reefs is able to cover the additional cash shortfall.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You can help us by making a contribution to our campaign and by sharing our campaign with your family, friends and social network. We have put together a wonderful suite of perks to match your generous contribution as a means of showing our gratitude for your invaluable contribution including our platinum perk featuring a 7 days stay at Beach Garden Villa, Carriacou. </p>

<h3>Beach Garden Villa</h3>

</div></div>","Who we are :
Founded and owned by husband and wife team, John Brown and Stephanie Brenner-Brown.  John is a United States Air Force Veteran of 10 years and software developer of 25 years.  Stephanie has a history of legal and state regulatory work with Environment and Wildlife management and legislation.

We want to change the world.  We want to inspire people to give back in one of 3 ways : 
1. to humanitarian efforts, everything from curing diseases, homelessness, and veteran care, to inspiring people to engage in better health practices and nutritional care.
2. to the animals of our planet, whether local community rescue shelters, or to larger impact areas like wildlife protection of endangered species, whether land or sea.
3. to the environment.  Our world is suffering.  We need to protect everything from our national and international protected nature preserves and parks, to the lakes and rivers, mountains, plains, deserts, forests, jungles, rainforests, coral and barrier reefs, to our precious oceans.
The Impact :
We will be making a HUGE difference in the world.

Our company will affect FOUR different areas of importance in the world every year.
Each year we will be giving back to Humanitarian, Wildlife, and Environmental ecosystem based charitable organizations.
And every 3 months, we will be donating excess inventory and product to needy communities around the world.
Spreading a positive message and encouraging compassion and altruistic behavior in all those that we are able to reach.

Contributors will be providing the startup capital for product inventory, while our eventual regular customers will be helping us give money in each of the 3 ways listed, as we contribute 10% of annual net profits to an organization in each of these categories every year.  We will also be spreading an important message about the power of giving while increasing compassion for all living things and ecosystems throughout our world.  Annual charities will change regularly to spread greater impact.

What We Need & What You Get :
With new numerous designs planned for launch, we are looking for $65,000 to start.

 

Campaign contributors will have the option to receive any of the following, or a combination of items :
a personal hand-written thank you
a limited edition t-shirt
free lifetime discount
free lifetime shipping
free lifetime discount AND lifetime shipping
For artists, who want to design their own, we will offer them their own signature collection and profile on our website
And everyone who contributes will be PERMANENTLY immortalized on our website, thanking influencers and contributors who helped bring our vision to life.


Since this is a flex-funding campaign, in the event that the funding goal is not met, all contributions will be kept.  All items will still be awarded, and all items deemed for future production will just be produced in smaller startup quantities.  We benefit more from the ability to purchase large bulk amounts since this reduces cost per item.  All products will be purchased & printed from various wholesalers, and ship from Austin, Texas.  Shipping is expected to begin January of 2017.  Contributors who are due to receive lifetime coupon codes will receive their coupon via email.

Perks :


 

​When you've gone the furthest you can go ... GO FURTHER.
Everyone faces risks and challenges.  We are no different.  But through goals, passion, perseverance, and determination, we can ascend.  The risk we face is that our products - shirts, sweatshirts, hats, and accessories - are just like everyone else's.  Essentially made of the same materials, by the same companies.  But where we differ is our company vision -  A dream to create world impact.  A vision of empowering everyone to exercise compassion.  Inspiring everyone to LIVE BIG, GIVE  BIGGER.
What We NEED from YOU ...
Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help :

Contribute.  Every little bit helps!  For your part, one of our rewards is all yours!
Can't spare a little cash?  Hey, we totally understand.  Times get tough, and with everyone wanting a little help, it can get overwhelming ... so instead, we would be forever grateful if you could SPREAD THE WORD!  Use the options at the top of the page to share on Facebook and Twitter.  Shout it loud and proud.  Please invite your friends and family.  We can't do it without your help.  ( Well, we can, but it will be a lot more work! )",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p>
<p>The <a href=""http://westtownshend.wix.com/wrcp#!community-kitchen/h5dn0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">West River Community Project's fledgling incubator kitchen</a>
allowed me to <b>try out running a bakery and to</b> <b>build a customer base</b>
in West Townshend before having to invest in commercial
infrastructure. Selling sandwich bread to the cafe at the West
Townshend Country Store and all kinds of loaves at the Townshend
Farmer's Market got Bread from the Earth on its feet, and over the
last year I've begun selling to other local stores and several

mission, and my tiny business is ready for some infrastructure of its
own. 
</p>
<h2><b>So here's why I need your
help!</b></h2>
<h3>I am so excited to announce that this fall we plan to build a
dreamy wood-fired brick oven
on my family's land, less than two miles up the hill from the West
Townshend Country Store. This oven will have a much bigger capacity
than the oven I am currently using, and will store heat longer and
more evenly allowing me to increase both the quantity and the
consistency of the bread I bake.               <br/>
</h3><h2>
<b>The Oven</b><br/>
</h2><p>It can be hard to understand the <b>difference between a pizza oven and a bread oven</b> - until you try to bake a lot of good bread in a pizza oven.<i> </i></p><p>Here are some of the ways the new oven will differ from the cob pizza oven I use now (and benefit me, my bread, and the folks who eat it):<br/></p><ul>
<li>The new bread oven will have <b>much more thermal mass</b> than the cob oven. This means that it will require more wood to get to temperature, but it will store much more heat as well, allowing me to bake batch after batch of bread without stopping for several hours to fire the oven again.</li>
<li>
<b>Lots of insulation</b> in the new oven will minimize heat loss and fuel-wood consumption, maximizing efficiency and allowing me to use as much of the heat as possible for baking.<br/>
</li>
<li>This oven will also have a lower chamber (meaning the height of ceiling of the oven will be lower). This feature allows <b>steam to collect more quickly</b> in the oven chamber, and steam is what gives artisan breads their shiny chewy crust. </li>
<li>And of course, the new oven will be <b>much bigger</b>, which means I will be able to bake a lot more bread relative to the amount of time I spend baking. This kind of capacity will allow my business to grow enough to support me and meet the demand of my community.<br/>
</li>
</ul><p>To learn more about what makes a masonry bread oven so great, I recommend these awesome books: <a href=""http://www.chelseagreen.com/from-the-woodfired-oven"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">From the Wood-Fired Oven</a> by Richard Miscovich and <a href=""http://www.chelseagreen.com/the-bread-builders"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Bread Builders</a> by Alan Scott and Daniel Wing.<br/></p><p>Bread from the Earth's oven will be built with the help of Matt Edmunds, a skilled
mason and the former apprentice of Peter Moore, the locally famous
oven-builder. While my friends and I will be helping with much of
the labor, the project will not be cheap. 
</p>
<h2>
<b>The Cost</b>
</h2>
<p><b>We expect the cost of the materials and professional labor for
the oven to be around $33,000 dollars. </b>
</p>
<p>This amount will cover the fire brick, cement, insulation
and other materials required as well as Matt's expert assistance in
constructing this large and
intricate piece of masonry.</p>
<p>There's a lot of infrastructure that goes into a bakery, but the <b>oven is its foundation.</b> My goal is to raise at least half of the total cost of the oven so that the amount I will have to borrow will be manageable. It is my vision that the work and resources I am investing in this project will rest on a foundation of community support. <br/></p><p>On top of this strong groundwork, I will be borrowing money for a mixer,
 coolers, freezers, work tables, and the numerous other items that a commercial bakery needs. The more help I can get in building the oven the less I will have to borrow for these critical expenses.<br/></p>
<p>We hope to build this oven in September and October and to be doing test bakes by November. By the beginning of 2017 I hope that Bread from the Earth will be operating fully out of its new home!<i><br/></i></p>
<h2>The Challenges</h2><p>My next task, once I have a larger baking capacity, will
be to continue to find new accounts for my bread. While this can be
challenging in a small town in a rural area, I am confident that
there is a larger market in this area than I am currently able to
produce for. As my capacity grows I hope to supply more local
stores and restaurants as well as vend at more farmers markets. Both the locals and the tourists who visit this area
have shown that they <b>value really good bread and are willing to pay
for it. </b>Recently I've had to turn down potential accounts that have been interested in my bread, so while I know it will take a lot of hard work, I also know there is lots of room in the area for my business to grow.</p><p><b>With your help, we can build an oven that will feed many
people, support me (and someday my family), and last for hundreds of
years.</b><br/></p><h2><b>And here's what you'll get
in return!</b></h2>
<p>I have lots of thank-you gifts I'm excited to share. Every contribution of $15 or more comes with a coupon for one of
Bread from the Earth's <b>artisan wood-fired loaves.</b> Larger donations
will receive hand-screened <b>T-shirts </b>showing the beautiful Bread from
the Earth logo, or a <b>CSB share</b> (8 weeks of good bread!). 
</p>
<h2><b>But the gift I'm the most excited about is this one:</b></h2>
<p>Everyone who donates $30 or more will have the opportunity to make
(or have made) a <b>personalized ceramic tile.</b> The larger the donation
the larger the tile, which can say or show anything you want: your
name, a blessing, something nice to look at, your hand print,
anything that will remind me of your participation in helping me
achieve this dream. Locals are invited to make them together with me
at the community ceramics studio, or we can make one for you (your design or ours) if
you're busy or far away. We will use these tiles to cover the outside of the oven when it
is complete, so the oven can be a constant reminder of the
love and support that I have received from friends, family,
strangers, and community members. 
</p>
<p>We'll invite any locals who are interested to come help us put
the tiles on the oven before the grand opening. Whenever you come to
the bakery for a pizza party, an all-you-can-eat french toast brunch
(!), or to pick up your bread <b>you'll see your tile and remember that
the bakery is yours too<i>.</i></b></p><i></i>
<h2>There
are so many ways you can help!</h2>
<p>Even if you don't have money to donate,
there are lots of ways you can show your support for Bread from the
Earth. First of all, please share this campaign with your family and
friends, or anyone you know who might be interested. Getting the word
out is half the battle and I can't do it without you.</p><p></p><p>I will also need lots of hands-on
assistance during the oven build, so if you're local and have <b>working
hands, a strong back, and a few spare hours</b> I would <b>love </b>to have your help!                                                                                                                     <br/></p><p>                <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466444736/IMG_1007_px7kq0.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 446.667px;height: 335px;""/></p> <p></p><p>This is not just a business, it's my

                               The Story of Bread from
the Earth
I
 have always loved to bake. My relationship with bread began with my 
Grandma and our Friday ritual of baking challah in her cabin on the lake
 in Maine. She
 taught me all those years ago that fresh bread is worthy of the labor 
it requires, and that it tastes like the love that goes into it. Since I discovered artisan baking almost five years ago at a small farm in southern Vermont, my  mission has been to feed my  community wholesome and delicious bread while supporting  local organic farmers and producers. For
 these reasons, all of the flour in my bread is organic and sourced as

Vermont, or as close to home as I can get it. I burn slab wood from local saw mills to heat my oven, which supports our local fuel 
economy and utilizes our community's rich resources.I am also passionate about the culture of sourdough. Natural leavening (sourdough culture, wild yeasts, mixed culture leaven) is a symbiotic community of bacteria and yeasts that work 
together to make bread rise, while simultaneously enhancing its 
flavor and nutritional value. The flavors, textures,  and digestability of sourdough are critical to the quality of the bread I bake, and are appreciated by the mouths and bellies of my customers.                         Thanks to every kind of support from this beautiful community, I
was able to begin operating as my own small business in June of 2015.

you're busy or far away. We will use these tiles to cover the outside of the oven when it
is complete, so the oven can be a constant reminder of the
love and support that I have received from friends, family,
strangers, and community members. 

We'll invite any locals who are interested to come help us put
the tiles on the oven before the grand opening. Whenever you come to
the bakery for a pizza party, an all-you-can-eat french toast brunch
(!), or to pick up your bread you'll see your tile and remember that
the bakery is yours too.
There
are so many ways you can help!
Even if you don't have money to donate,
there are lots of ways you can show your support for Bread from the
Earth. First of all, please share this campaign with your family and
friends, or anyone you know who might be interested. Getting the word
out is half the battle and I can't do it without you.I will also need lots of hands-on
assistance during the oven build, so if you're local and have working
hands, a strong back, and a few spare hours I would love to have your help!                                                                                                                                      This is not just a business, it's my
life. It would be my pleasure to talk to you about what I'm doing and answer all
of your questions. Please be in touch – feeling your loving support
is just as important to me as raising money.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart
for helping me build the foundation
for the next phase of Bread from the Earth!",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>About the Founder</u></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478640522/cr5jxws0gv9zrkpccb1u.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></u></p>
<p>     My name is Felicia Barlow, I am 30 years old and have a sweet, but sarcastic (I don't know where he picked up this trait), son who is 9. I spent my early adult life working in the hospitality and medical industries while raising my son. I have talked about opening a Bed &amp; Breakfast for many years and it dawned on me one day that I needed to stop talking about it and actually do it! I resigned from my career of 9 years and went to school full time. I crammed 6-8 classes into each semester, even the summers, to get done as quickly as possible. I am heading into my last semester of the Business Entrepreneurship program with a minor in Sustainability. In addition to maintaining a spot on the Dean's List, I have held the position of Sustainability Club President which has allowed me the opportunity to serve my local community and build strong relationships with local sustainable businesses.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478640581/oqo5axtjmrlshgahqfp0.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478641156/l0utddomxtojbaw1ajhd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>     During my studies, I pivoted from a bed &amp; breakfast to a hostel because of an experience I had last summer while traveling with my family. I was traveling to Indiana to job shadow a bed &amp; breakfast owner, on the way our flights were delayed and canceled until we ended up stuck in the L.A. airport. It was the middle of the night when we arrived, forcing us to claim our baggage, and leaving us faced with two options, pay for a hotel costing $150 a night which was 45 minutes away, or sleep in the airport. We were exhausted and had about 6 hours before our flight. By the time we would have checked into a hotel we would have only had 4 hours to sleep before  getting back to the airport to check in. We were traveling on a tight budget so we were left with only one option, sleep in the L.A. airport lobby. When we finally arrived in Indiana we had a wonderful experience with the bed &amp; breakfast owner who also happened to own a hostel. By the time I returned I knew I wanted to create a place for other people experiencing unpleasant flying experiences. The solution is a hostel, close to the airport.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>The Vision</u></h3>
<p>     There is a building available to renovate into a hostel in Boise, Idaho (this location could change if the current desired location sells before we raise the funds to purchase). The location is 2.3 miles from the airport, 2 miles to downtown, and 1 mile from the Boise State campus. This business is closely aligned with my values, beliefs, and dreams. I feel passionately about creating a sustainability focused lodging option for people to stay comfortably while not consuming their entire travel budget.</p>
<p>     By contributing to this campaign you will be helping travelers have a safe, comfortable, and affordable place to sleep. You will be contributing to a business that puts environmental impact at the top of its priority list. Lastly, you will be providing a mother, who has paid her own way through college, a way to start a business which will serve the local community and provide an income for her family.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Sustainability Vision</u></h3>
<p>I take sustainability very seriously so Hostel Ohana will be forever evolving with the most efficient methods available. I have been heavily involved in the sustainability community in Boise, Idaho through volunteering for places such as The Boise EcoVillage Project, Treefort Music Festival Green Team, Fish and Game Fire Restoration, and maintaining the position of President of the Sustainability Club &amp; Community Garden at Boise State. With these experiences and the continuous education I receive on the sustainability front, Hostel Ohana will be able to maintain the highest level of sustainability. There will be cost barriers in the beginning so everything will need to happen in phases but here is a list of what will be incorporated over time:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: center;"">Solar Power</li>
<li style=""text-align: center;"">Organic non GMO garden for guests to access</li>
<li style=""text-align: center;"">Bicycles available for guest use</li>
<li style=""text-align: center;"">Reclaimed materials for all interior furniture</li>
<li style=""text-align: center;"">Where reclaimed materials are not available, sustainable, fair trade, ethically made, sourcing and materials will be purchased</li>
<li style=""text-align: center;"">Business cards will be made from up-cycled cardboard using a stamp and eco-friendly ink</li>
<li style=""text-align: center;"">Natural light will be maximized reducing the need for artificial light</li>
<li style=""text-align: center;"">LED bulbs throughout</li>
<li style=""text-align: center;"">Composting, vermicomposting and bokashi methods</li>
<li style=""text-align: center;"">Recycling</li>
<li style=""text-align: center;"">Locally made sustainable soaps/lotions/toothpaste will be made available</li>
<li style=""text-align: center;"">Sustainable fabrics for linens</li>
<li style=""text-align: center;"">Other local sustainable businesses will be supported through our recommendations, subscriptions, and volunteering.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>$400,000 is the target amount to raise which will go towards:</strong></p>

</div></div>","About the Founder

     My name is Felicia Barlow, I am 30 years old and have a sweet, but sarcastic (I don't know where he picked up this trait), son who is 9. I spent my early adult life working in the hospitality and medical industries while raising my son. I have talked about opening a Bed & Breakfast for many years and it dawned on me one day that I needed to stop talking about it and actually do it! I resigned from my career of 9 years and went to school full time. I crammed 6-8 classes into each semester, even the summers, to get done as quickly as possible. I am heading into my last semester of the Business Entrepreneurship program with a minor in Sustainability. In addition to maintaining a spot on the Dean's List, I have held the position of Sustainability Club President which has allowed me the opportunity to serve my local community and build strong relationships with local sustainable businesses.

     During my studies, I pivoted from a bed & breakfast to a hostel because of an experience I had last summer while traveling with my family. I was traveling to Indiana to job shadow a bed & breakfast owner, on the way our flights were delayed and canceled until we ended up stuck in the L.A. airport. It was the middle of the night when we arrived, forcing us to claim our baggage, and leaving us faced with two options, pay for a hotel costing $150 a night which was 45 minutes away, or sleep in the airport. We were exhausted and had about 6 hours before our flight. By the time we would have checked into a hotel we would have only had 4 hours to sleep before  getting back to the airport to check in. We were traveling on a tight budget so we were left with only one option, sleep in the L.A. airport lobby. When we finally arrived in Indiana we had a wonderful experience with the bed & breakfast owner who also happened to own a hostel. By the time I returned I knew I wanted to create a place for other people experiencing unpleasant flying experiences. The solution is a hostel, close to the airport.
 
The Vision
     There is a building available to renovate into a hostel in Boise, Idaho (this location could change if the current desired location sells before we raise the funds to purchase). The location is 2.3 miles from the airport, 2 miles to downtown, and 1 mile from the Boise State campus. This business is closely aligned with my values, beliefs, and dreams. I feel passionately about creating a sustainability focused lodging option for people to stay comfortably while not consuming their entire travel budget.
     By contributing to this campaign you will be helping travelers have a safe, comfortable, and affordable place to sleep. You will be contributing to a business that puts environmental impact at the top of its priority list. Lastly, you will be providing a mother, who has paid her own way through college, a way to start a business which will serve the local community and provide an income for her family.
Sustainability Vision
I take sustainability very seriously so Hostel Ohana will be forever evolving with the most efficient methods available. I have been heavily involved in the sustainability community in Boise, Idaho through volunteering for places such as The Boise EcoVillage Project, Treefort Music Festival Green Team, Fish and Game Fire Restoration, and maintaining the position of President of the Sustainability Club & Community Garden at Boise State. With these experiences and the continuous education I receive on the sustainability front, Hostel Ohana will be able to maintain the highest level of sustainability. There will be cost barriers in the beginning so everything will need to happen in phases but here is a list of what will be incorporated over time:

Solar Power
Organic non GMO garden for guests to access
Bicycles available for guest use
Reclaimed materials for all interior furniture
Where reclaimed materials are not available, sustainable, fair trade, ethically made, sourcing and materials will be purchased
Business cards will be made from up-cycled cardboard using a stamp and eco-friendly ink
Natural light will be maximized reducing the need for artificial light
LED bulbs throughout
Composting, vermicomposting and bokashi methods
Recycling
Locally made sustainable soaps/lotions/toothpaste will be made available
Sustainable fabrics for linens
Other local sustainable businesses will be supported through our recommendations, subscriptions, and volunteering.


Where Does the Money Go?
     The available building is completely gutted which oddly works in our favor. With a clean slate we are able to input sustainable sourced and created fixtures, furnishings, and equipment.
$400,000 is the target amount to raise which will go towards:
Purchase of building
Electrical work
Beds and linens
Bathrooms
Security cameras
Privacy fence
Office supplies
Outdoor garden providing fresh food for guests
Kitchen cabinets/appliances/tableware/cookware
Lockers to provide a safe place for belongings
Remodel two garages on property to be male & female bunk rooms.
Locks with individualized codes for entry into property
Coin operated washer and dryer
And much more!
What's In It For You?
     When you contribute you will receive passes for nightly stays at the hostel based on your contribution amount. These passes are transferable, meaning if you wish to give them away to friends, family, or employees feel free! We welcome all new and returning guests!
     When you stay with us you will experience an upscale hostel experience. What does ""upscale hostel experience"" mean? It means you will not be sleeping on a bunk bed where you can feel the movements of strangers in their bed, instead you will have an individual bunk that is mounted directly to the wall. You will have privacy curtains for sleeping or personal space. You will have a locker for all your belongings to be safely stored.
     Ohana is the Hawaiian word for family. I chose this as the name of the hostel because Ohana is an all-encompassing word for family. It does not mean merely your blood related family, but also those people who enter your life and are considered family. Hostel Ohana will foster a comfortable, friendly environment where you will meet people who will forever be a part of who you are, they will become your Hostel Ohana. 
How to use your Perks:

Perks cannot be redeemed for cash.
Nights do not need to be consecutive.
All perks are subject to space availability. Limitations on number of Perk redemption's per day/month may apply because we still have to be able to pay our monthly overhead.
Perks do not expire.
All perks are transferable to other persons. You may give them away or sell them.

If we do not reach our goal:
You will receive your money back if we do not meet the minimum threshold of $100,000.

The Impact
     In short, this project was born through the suffering I experienced during air travels. With the location of this Hostel so close to the airport you will be providing travelers and airline staff alike with an affordable, comfortable, safe place to stay. In addition to this, you will be able to rest easy knowing the impact on the environment will be continuously evaluated and modified to create the smallest negative impact possible.

African countries produce 70% of the cacao that is commercialized
around the world. In these plantations they
endure conditions of slavery and exploitive child labor. A few
corporations control the global market of chocolate while the farmers
make a miserable amount for the cacao that they produce. For this
reason, as a cooperative, we are cultivating
direct and fair relationships with our farmer families,
removing the middlemen (known as <i>""coyotes""</i>), that
pay so little to the growers and mess with
our people. 

<p>
</p>
<p>Cacao is a native
plant to the Mexican South and Southeast. The Mayans were the first
to grow cacao approximately 2,000 years ago. The
fruit of the cacao tree was considered a sacred seed, which was used
for the Mayans as an offering to the gods and as a sacred drink:
XOCOLALT (chocolate in the original language ""nahuatl"").
Also, it was used as a form of currency, to provide energy during the
workday and to heal

<p>What
we hope for is to make a healthy chocolate in which there is NO
EXPLOITATION OF ANYONE IN PRODUCING IT, recovering the artisanal way
of chocolate making using traditional recipes from our communities,
and ultimately, selling it at fair prices. With
these goals in mind,
in order to make our chocolate we toast the cacao in the “comal”
(traditional stove made of clay) and we use natural, organic and
local ingredients: honey from la Sierra Sur and from the coast, cane
sugar or brown sugar from the Mixe region and amaranth from a network of
family-farmers from the central valleys. Thanks to all of them,
we generate A SPECIAL CHOCOLATE WITH UNIQUE QUALITIES. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The
cacao
trees from which
it is grown coexists with other plants, such as coffee or “guanábana”
(soursop). All
of this effort and energy from the people transforms the grain into a
tablet of chocolate. 
</p>
<p>As
a cooperative, we have three basic principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Autogestión (Self-sufficiency):
	we generate and struggle for a
	dignified income for ourselves</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Autonomy:
	we make our own decisions and collectively decide the course of our
	cooperative</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Food
	sovereignty: we recuperate our local-traditional food and our native
	roots</p>
</li>
</ul>As
our name states, we do not think we will change the world just by
making chocolate. We also give great importance to sharing ideas and to
the process of learning as tools for liberation. Sharing is important
because it allows us to find ourselves and build ourselves back up
again. By “learning”, we mean that we are recuperating the
ancestral knowledge of our people. This process is important because
it permits us to continue on our journey towards autonomy.  In the
context of sharing, learning, and above all organizing, we are able
to create a new world, for our families, for our communities and
for all those who will come.

we generate A SPECIAL CHOCOLATE WITH UNIQUE QUALITIES. 



The
cacao
trees from which
it is grown coexists with other plants, such as coffee or “guanábana”
(soursop). All
of this effort and energy from the people transforms the grain into a
tablet of chocolate. 

As
a cooperative, we have three basic principles:


Autogestión (Self-sufficiency):
	we generate and struggle for a
	dignified income for ourselves


Autonomy:
	we make our own decisions and collectively decide the course of our
	cooperative


Food
	sovereignty: we recuperate our local-traditional food and our native
	roots

As
our name states, we do not think we will change the world just by
making chocolate. We also give great importance to sharing ideas and to
the process of learning as tools for liberation. Sharing is important
because it allows us to find ourselves and build ourselves back up
again. By “learning”, we mean that we are recuperating the
ancestral knowledge of our people. This process is important because
it permits us to continue on our journey towards autonomy.  In the
context of sharing, learning, and above all organizing, we are able
to create a new world, for our families, for our communities and
for all those who will come.  

Thanks for taking the time to read this and support us!

¿Quiénes somos?





Somos
tres jóvenes oaxaqueños, Edgardo, Areli y Elvia, que en 2012
formamos nuestra Cooperativa (C.A.C.A.O.) en busca de un trabajo
digno. Decidimos crear nuestra propia manera de vivir y al mismo
tiempo rescatar nuestras costumbres y tradiciones ¿porqué hacerlo a
través del chocolate? porque en nuestra tierra, Oaxaca, México, el
chocolate mantiene una memoria muy viva, es un símbolo de
resistencia y está muy fuerte en nuestras raíces originarias.
Juntos aprendimos a hacer chocolate a través de las enseñanzas de
nuestras abuelas, rescatamos recetas tradicionales e innovamos otras,
elaboramos chocolate semiamargo con ingredientes como miel, azúcar mascabado, mezcal, piloncillo y amaranto.
C.A.C.A.O.
significa Cooperativa Autónoma de Convivencia y Aprendizaje de
Oaxaca y nuestro objetivo es rescatar la manera
ancestral de hacer el chocolate. Nosotros no queremos un
chocolate que enferme ni un trabajo que nos explote, queremos un chocolate que nos de fuerzas para
alcanzar la autonomía y crear una
alternativa al empleo explotador recuperando así la capacidad
autónoma de vivir y de comer. 
Tú puedes ser parte de este sueño 
Estamos
en un momento de la cooperativa en el que necesitamos dar un paso más
para alcanzar nuestros sueños, por eso estamos pidiendo tu apoyo
para tener mejores herramientas de trabajo. Con tu apoyo esperamos
recaudar lo necesario para la compra de un molino y
dos bicimáquinas que nos permitan mejorar nuestra producción. Además, con las
bicimáquinas seremos capaces de realizar más talleres a los que
invitaremos a más personas.
Si
logramos nuestro objetivo seremos capaces de vivir realmente de la
producción de nuestro chocolate además que esto nos permitirá
ampliar nuestras relaciones con los productores locales y nuestras
comunidades.Nosotros creemos en la solidaridad, el apoyo mutuo y la reciprocidad por lo que al apoyar esta campaña podrás recibir una recompensa especial hecha con cariño para ti:Si
no te es posible apoyarnos económicamente, no te preocupes, existen
otras formas de colaboración que podemos llevar a cabo como:
traducciones, diseño gráfico e industrial, fotografía, grabación
y edición de videos. ¡Ponte en contacto con nosotros! cooperativa.cacao@gmail.com 

Un chocolate rebelde






Actualmente, los
países de África Occidental producen el 70% del cacao que se
comercializa en el mundo, en estas plantaciones se viven condiciones
de esclavitud y explotación infantil, unas
cuantas empresas controlan el mercado mundial de chocolate mientras
los campesinos ganan
una miseria por el cacao que producen, por
eso como cooperativa tejemos una relación directa y justa con 
nuestras
familias campesinas quitando
del camino a los
intermediarios y coyotes que pagan precios de miseria y chingan a
nuestra gente. 
El
cacao es una planta nativa del sur y sureste mexicano, los
mayas fueron los primeros en sembrar cacao hace aproximadamente más
de 2000 años. El fruto del árbol de cacao era considerada
una semilla sagrada, la cual fue utilizada por los mayas como ofrenda
para los dioses, “moneda” de cambio, para preparar bebidas
sagradas como el XOCOLALT (chocolate), para dar fuerza en el trabajo
y para curar. 



Lo
que nosotros buscamos es ELABORAR
UN CHOCOLATE SANO
EN EL QUE NO HAYA
EXPLOTACIÓN DE NADIE PARA PRODUCIRLO,
rescatando la manera artesanal de elaborarlo y las recetas
tradicionales de nuestras
comunidades, además de
precios justos. Por eso para
elaborar nuestro chocolate tostamos
en comal de barro y usamos
ingredientes naturales, orgánicos,
de productores locales: la
miel que utilizamos viene de la Sierra Sur y de la Costa, la panela o
piloncillo nos llega de la Región
Mixe, el amaranto que usamos
proviene de una red de productoras de los Valles Centrales; gracias
a todo esto generamos UN CHOCOLATE ESPECIAL
CON CUALIDADES ÚNICAS.




El
chocolate desde que está sembrado convive con otras plantas como el
café, la guanabana y con el campesino, luego con quienes lo
tostamos, molemos y entablillamos y al final con quien lo bebe o lo
come.  Toda esta fuerza y energia de la gente transforma el grano en
una tablilla de chocolate. 




Como
cooperativa tenemos tres principios básicos:





	AUTOGESTIÓN:
	generar y buscar por nuestra cuenta ingresos dignos

	AUTONOMÍA:
	tomar nuestras propias decisiones y decidir colectivamente el rumbo
	de nuestra cooperativa



	SOBERANÍA
	ALIMENTARIA: recuperar nuestra comida local-tradicional y nuestras
	semillas nativas



Como
lo dice nuestro nombre, no pensamos que sólo haciendo chocolate
vamos a cambiar el mundo, tenemos que dar mucha importancia a la
convivencia y el aprendizaje como herramientas de liberación; la
convivencia porque tenemos que retejernos de nuevo, encontrarnos,
compartirnos y organizarnos; aprendizaje, en el sentido de recuperar
los conocimientos ancestrales de nuestros pueblos que nos permitan
caminar hacia la autonomía. Con convivencia,
aprendizaje
y sobre todo organización
podemos rehacer de nuevo el mundo, para nosotros, nuestras familias,
nuestras comunidades y para los que apenas vienen.

<p>By empowering the locals with these basics like water supply, agricultural skills and tools, the project aims to bring the village under some agri-business activities such as organic farming, vegetable seed production, honey production, livestock production,etc.   Through awareness raising and training we plan to generate several agribusiness jobs and uplift the livelihood of farmers.</p>

This is the first step towards building a
sustainable agricultural revolution in a small village in the Western Region of
Nepal.  We are asking for your support to
help us start the first stage of this project. 
As the first farmer owned cooperative in this region, the cooperative
will face the highest start-up costs which is why we need your support in order
to make this a reality.  The funds will be used to build 10,000 ltrs of water reservoir, buy agricultural tools and organise training to the farmers. 






According to the World Bank, investing in
agriculture is twice as effective at eliminating poverty than investing in any
other sector.  We believe that by taking a small step at a time and helping each other, we can create a revolution to develop an innovative agricultural approach that seeks to empower the future youths.
Through Indigogo, we hope
to raise part of our start up cost to ensure we have a solid foundation and
tools we need to begin a successful journey of boosting agricultural system,
create job and generate incomes.
  

STORY - WHY I CHOSE THIS PROJECT!
A brief visit in 2015 to my village (where I
was born) after 15 long years made me fall in love instantly.  The heavenly pristine nature and the innocent people attracted me to come back with a social cause and giving back to the community.  Since I always wanted to do something for my village I thought what better time than this to give back to your community as we are now in the era of historic challenge.  






The
population of the community still largely depend on land and agriculture, however, they
produce only for home consumption or are not aware of commercial farming and
market demands.  They have no way to learn best practices of farm management
that would let them double their yields and also not aware of the products
available to them or how they work. Therefore, we came up with the project
based on agriculture and agro-industrialization for a sustainable .  
At the time when the government is stressing to
boost the economy of Nepal through agriculture by bringing different packages,
the people in the village are still not aware of government grants and other
opportunities.  The project will also work as
a linkage between government, producers, traders and other stakeholders.  
   

WHAT WE NEED 
We now need your support to make this project come live and make it a reality!!! 
 






THE IMPACT
 

By empowering the locals with these basics like water supply, agricultural skills and tools, the project aims to bring the village under some agri-business activities such as organic farming, vegetable seed production, honey production, livestock production,etc.   Through awareness raising and training we plan to generate several agribusiness jobs and uplift the livelihood of farmers.
Once we have created the model for this first project, our plan is to replicate it and build more community owned agricultural trade in the surrounding villages.  We believe that this is just the start of new door that will lead to thousands of other opportunities!! 



 RISKS AND CHALLENGES
The first of its kind in this village,  the project will be a big challenge creating awareness among people towards commercial farming.


THE NEXT CHAPTER
So far, 12 farmers signed up to become part of our movement. That is great! - but we want to make it possible for hundreds and thousands of them!!!
With this project, we’re trying to further build this community to not only reach more farmers and help them uplift their livelihood but also want to show them how many people believe in the idea already so they have the courage to join in.  Lets work together for a  power to achieve anything so nothing can hold them!!

<h3>WHO ARE WE &amp; WHAT IS THIS?</h3>
<ul>
<li>My name is Chris Seaver and for the last 25 years I have been making low budget comedy horror films. I have decided to tackle a new adventure by opening up my own 80s inspired Entertainment store and lounge.</li>
<li> </li>
<li>Chris Seaver-Born in 1977 and growing up in the 80s I was able to absorb the pop culture like a sponge and to this day I am obsessed with the decade. I am a guy that is very passionate and driven and loves to hold on to the things that made me who I am as a person. I want to bring back that feeling of stepping into a video store and seeing all the posters and cover art and having the thoughts of what the movies could be race through ones mind. I want to provide not only a place for old fans to get all nostalgic but also a place for NEW fans to experience what it was like being a genre geek in the 1980's. Imagine a place where you can not only rent and BUY VHS, DVD and Blu Rays of the best 1980's genre faire, but also a place to hang out with your friends and play old school Nintendo, Sega and Atari, To get involved in special geeky trivia nights, Karaoke nights AND enjoy special screenings of some of the best movies, Tv, and cartoons from the 80s and early 90s, not to mention Indie films from local and western NY filmmakers! I wanna LIVE in that place and I welcome you to join in the excellent party! </li>
<li>What you're doing by donating is helping me bring my dream to life. Your contributions will help us launch and establish ourselves as the PREMIERE Retro 80's video and entertainment location. Will also be a dedicated home for Fright Rags kick ass Horror T-shirts! You will also be helping bring back the human to human in store contact and communication of like minded geeks and pop culture lovers who long to re live the times of spandex, big hair and radical media. Something that is real and tangible and a place that can be your home away from home. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</strong></p>
</div><div><ul>
<li>We need to raise 8,000 Dollars to get us up and running. This is to pay for up front fees for our location, to acquire our products and inventory such as videos, dvd and blu rays, posters, t-shirts, vintage movie and child hood memorabilia, toys, magazines, comics, etc...to furnish and decorate the establishment and to bring that old school feel. We plan to have an old school game area PLUS a screening area as well. We will need signs, Paint, carpets, all to help bring the 80's to life. </li>
<li>Our perks are geared towards Indie horror film, 1980's swag and unique Merch for the store itself as well as becoming a member of the Creeping 80's Army! From Local Filmmakers to Fright Rags kick ass Horror Shirts! </li>

<li>Everything raised will go towards the launch of this store and making sure it is the best and most unique place you have been to. If our goal is not met, all donations will go towards the most immediate  issues at hand, be it our store location and or gathering the decor and we will re-campaign and or find new avenues to ensure an epic opening! </li>
</ul></div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This store has the potential to truly be a one stop shop for your nostalgic needs AND bring people together in a very fun and unique way. Grow a community of not only 80's fans but pop culture and genre fans as well. In the world we live in, a little more fun and unity is MUCH needed, and appreciated, wouldn't you agree? </p>I can't do this without you. If you love the 80's, if you love your child hood and are as nostalgic about the things you held dear while growing up and want to express yourself in an environment that welcomes and champions the geek in us all, than PLEASE help make "" It Crept From The 80's"" a reality. </div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>in a world that is moving fast and furious in so many ways, most of all tech and information, I personally think you need to step back and take a look at what helped make growing up so much fun. It was a simpler time and people trusted each other and enjoyed more for the pure fact of...ENJOYING something. Is it a risk to open up a video rental store in 2017, HELL YES IT IS, but sometimes you need to take a risk in life to make a dream a reality. This is also why Crept from the 80's won't simply be a video rental store. It will also be a place to buy 1980s and early 90's classics and obscure films on VHS, DVD and BLU RAY, a place for you to buy bits of your childhood through vintage toys, posters, t-shirts, etc...A place to interact with friends and fellow fans of genre in all aspects. A place to see films you may have never heard of or even knew existed that were made right in your home town and to experience movie, tv and cartoon marathons that will bring groups together and could create bonding and lasting friendships. Believe me, the risk is there but why be afraid to take the leap? You will never know until you try and remember what Doc Brown always said "" if you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything."" or take what the little green Jedi said to Luke, to heart-"" Do or do not, there is no try."" I agree. Help me DO, won't you? </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't donate, that's alright too. Help us spread the word. Post our campaign, Facebook page, Twitter, Instagram, what have you ALL over the place. Flyer around your area and let people know there is something very cool and wicked awesome on the horizon that they should be on top of. Everything helps. </p>

<p><strong>Galway Rock at Ballston Lake</strong></p>
<p>Galway Rock Vineyard and Winery is a family owned and operated farm winery located in Galway, NY.  After growing grapes, making wine, and managing wineries for other folks, Kate and Ryan Taylor decided it was high time to move home and start their own winery.  With the generosity of our family, we were able to borrow land and a garage to start a pilot vineyard and small production area.  Having outgrown the garage winery that we started in three years ago, we are ready to spread out and set down roots.  After searching high and low we have found a property that we believe will yield great wines in a unique setting. </p>
<p><strong>The Project</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501217192/kuebxsrgzui9gsax1dcd.png"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>We aim to open a tasting room at 998 Saratoga Rd in the Town of Ballston Lake.   The 1800 square foot building will be home to our tasting room and part of our winery while we grow.  This warehouse has an open floor plan that will give customers an opportunity to come in and enjoy a guided tasting with us while looking on at the production floor just beyond the tasting room.  We’ll be able to hold small parties and events in our tasting room, patio, and winery.  In the spring we will begin planting vines on the farm adjacent to the winery and tasting room.  With your generosity, we can turn this tired warehouse into a wonderful place where our customers can gather to experience the entire winegrowing process from grape to glass. </p>
<p><strong>The Site</strong></p>

<p>The farm is situated on the slopes of Ballston Lake on its western shore and has a special significance to us because it is located in the heart of our community.  The property has recently been placed in the American Farmland Trust.  This means from this point forward the sole purpose of this land shall be farming.  Sloped lands within proximity to large bodies of water are wonderful places to grow grapes.  The lake will act as an air conditioner for our grapes on hot summer days and a heater for them on cool nights as they make their way from bud to berry.  The slope of the land will focus the sun's rays on our grapes so that they achieve maximum ripeness from all points in the vineyard. </p>
<p><strong>The Dream</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501644789/hscuwskrofascrz3ggeq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our dream is to plant a vineyard where over a lifetime the vines will mature from small twiggy cuttings into old gnarly vines that yield sweet aromatic grapes each fall.  This maturity along with the vineyard situation on Ballston Lake will translate into a sense of place, or terroir in our wine.  We want to be able to share this endeavor with our customers, whom we regard as friends and family.  We dream of tending to the vines through the seasons and years, holding harvest dinners, and barrel tastings.  This new property will open the door to our dreams and we hope you are there with us. </p>

<p>Our goal is to raise $10,000 over the next 30 days in order to fully transform this property.  We aren’t looking for free money, but rather want our friends and family to be the first to experience our dream with some entertaining events and packages.   Your contribution right now will help us stock up on the essentials so that we can create a unique experience right here in Ballston Lake.  We are truly grateful for the support you have shown us over the years and especially for your contribution.  As a way to say thanks, all the rewards we are offering are priced below our planned retail value.</p>

For example, with the micro beads, nobody suspected they were endangering many wildlife marine species until recently. What a shock, when the technologies and surveys revealed the truth about these small micro beads that could have been simply and easily replaced with natural ingredients.

<h4>Opportunité économique pour les fermiers en développement durables. </h4>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">En achetant avec Wholistic Aroma vous donnez la priorité à des petits producteurs et fermiers en développement durable. En effet, chez Wholistic Aroma, nous faisons le sourcing en choisissant les meilleurs ingrédients produits en développement durable et agriculture raisonnée. </span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>C'est meilleur pour l'environnement grâce à leur agriculture durable. </li></ul>

<p>Parce que France sait pertinemment que nous ne devrions utiliser que des produits de grande qualité, elle s'engage à sourcer les ingrédients dans les pays dans lesquels c'est la spécialité. Par exemple, pour l'huile de Coco, Tamanu et Vanille, France a trouvé des fournisseurs au Vanuatu et en Nouvelle Calédonie pendant qu'elle habitait dans le Pacifique sud. Pour la lavande, France a pris contact avec des producteurs Provençaux, dans son pays d'origine. Elle est tellement passionnée qu'elle connait toutes les déclinaisons et variétés de lavandes en fonction du lieu de la culture, du versant sud ou du versant nord de la montagne, etc. </p>

<h4>VOTRE SANTE</h4>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Il est assez alarmant de penser au nombre 515. Vous rappelez-vous c'est la quantité de produits toxiques dans les cosmétiques moyennes qu'une femme utilise tous les jours sur sa peau? </span><br/></p>

<h4>L'ENVIRONNEMENT </h4>
<p>En utilisant uniquement des ingrédients naturels, cela signifie que l'eau qui sort de votre douche, passe par les cours d'eau, les rivières et finit dans les océans sera sans danger pour les animaux et la qualité de l'eau. Par exemple, avec les microbilles utilisées dans la cosmétique, personne ne soupçonnait à quel point elles étaient dangereuses pour de nombreuses espèces animales marines jusqu'à récemment. Quel choc, quand les techniques et études de marché ont permis de démontrer l'impact dangereux de ces microbilles qui auraient pu simplement et facilement être remplacées par des ingrédients naturels. </p>
<p>Combien de temps devons nous attendre avant de découvrir la prochaine vérité sur les produits chimiques utilisés dans nos cosmétiques? <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p>

<h4><br/></h4>
<h4>Pour une cosmétique abordable ET qualitative </h4>
<p>En achetant des ingrédients naturels et en faisant votre cosmétique maison, vous payez 100% du prix pour la qualité des ingrédients. </p>
<p>En achetant des produits de cosmétiques classiques, (même certains ""naturels"") vous payez environ 15% pour les ingrédients (en restant large) et le reste des 85% est dédié au marketing, R&amp;D, etc. <br/>Préférez vous nourrir votre peau avec des ingrédients de qualité ou du marketing? <br/><br/></p>
<h4>Participer à des opportunités d'emploi pour des personnes atteintes de handicap invisibles. </h4>
<p>Saviez vous que 19 millions de personnes parmi celles à qui l'on a reconnu un handicap lourd souffrent d'handicap invisible aux Etas-Unis? </p>
<p>Ces personnes n'utilisent pas de canne ou quoi que ce soit comme dispositif d'aide et peuvent paraitre parfaitement en bonne santé. </p>
<p>Ce dont elles ont besoin ce sont des conditions et heures de travail flexibles car il peut leur arriver de ne pouvoir se rendre au travail un jour, mais pourraient totalement être mieux le jour suivant et opérationnelles pour aller au travail. </p>
<p>                                                                <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461437063/picto_handi_etzb0f.png"" src="""" style=""width: 76.5936599423631px;height: 194px;""/></p>
<p>Comme France Engels, la fondatrice, est atteinte de névralgie du trijumeau, elle est totalement consciente du problème que beaucoup de personnes atteintes de handicap invisible peuvent rencontrer. Son idée est donc d'ouvrir des postes à d'autres personnes atteintes de handicap invisible grâce à un plan d'horaires de travail modulables. </p>
<p>En achetant avec nous, vous aidez donc aussi la communauté de personnes avec handicap invisible à garder une intégration sociale et des opportunités de travail. </p>

Why buying with Wholistic Aroma? 



Economic opportunity for sustainable farmers 
By buying with Wholistic Aroma you give priority to small producers and sustainable farmers. Indeed, at Wholistic Aroma, we do the sourcing  by choosing the best quality ingredients with small sustainable farmers. 


It is better for the environment because their agriculture is sustainable
It helps them stay competitive on the market and earn a fair income. 
It helps keep the ancestral traditions and knowledge of their agriculture. 

        France in New Caledonia visiting a Vanilla plantation


Because France knows that we should have the best quality, she is committed to source the ingredients in the countries from which it is a specialty. For example, for the Cocoa, Tamanu and Vanilla, France has been sourcing in Vanuatu & New Caledonia while she lived in the South Pacific. For Lavender, France has been sourcing in Provence, South of France, her home country. She is such a passionate that she knows all the insights of lavender production, such as the differences an essential oil will have whether it is cultivated on the North or South versant of the mountain, etc. 

Anaïs & Anthony (happy) sourcing lavender in Provence


Helping a chemical free planet for:
YOUR HEALTH 
When you think about the number 515 it is quiet alarming. Do you remember, it is the quantity of toxic chemicals in the average cosmetic that a woman is using every day? 
When you know that all those products penetrate the skin all day long, circulates via the bloodstream and stays in your body for years...well, obviously, for your health and that of your children, you should use 100% natural skincare. 
And we do insist on 100% natural!!! 




THE ENVIRONMENT
By using only natural ingredients in your skincare, this means that all the water that goes out of your shower, in the streams, passing through the rivers and ending in the oceans will be harmless for the animals and the quality of the water. For example, with the micro beads, nobody suspected they were endangering many wildlife marine species until recently. What a shock, when the technologies and surveys revealed the truth about these small micro beads that could have been simply and easily replaced with natural ingredients. How long should we wait before discovering the next truth about toxic chemicals in our skincare? 



    


For an affordable and qualitative skincare
By purchasing natural ingredients and DIY your own skincare, you are paying 100% of the price for quality ingredients. 
By purchasing an average personal care product (even some ""natural cosmetic"") you are paying roughly 15% for the ingredients (to be large) and the remaining 85%  is going to marketing, R&D, etc. 
Would you rather nourish your skin with quality ingredients or marketing? 

Giving employment opportunity for invisibly handiccaped
Did you know that 19 million of the people
who were defined as severely disabled are suffering from invisible illness in
USA?
These people do not use a cane or any
assistive device and may look perfectly healthy. What they need is to have flexible work hours and conditions because at some point they might not be able to go to work one day, but could totally be better the next day and totally operational.  



As France Engels, the founder, is what we call a Trigeminal Neuralgia Warrior, she is totally aware of the problem that many invisibly handicapped might encounter. Therefore the idea is to open positions to others with invisible illnesses thanks to a flexible work hours plan. 
By purchasing with us, you are also helping the community of invisible illnesses to keep a social and employment integration. 


Meet with Wholistic Aroma Team At Wholistic Aroma, it is a mother and daughter story. 


     France Engels, Founder and Master of Aromatherapy
France is PA-SSIO-NA-TE about
aromatherapy, skincare and wellbeing. She started her career as an osteopath,
taking care of humans and animals. She has always lived in the countryside and
grew up in Provence in the South of France and has been using plants and
aromatherapy for her wellbeing and that of her family. A few years ago she had a nerve
injured in a surgery and since then is suffering from an invisible handicap.
Because she is a warrior, she wants to combine her passion, her job, and bring
hope and awareness to those in the same situation, therefore helping all the
invisibly handicapped community. Her boost for inspiration is
chocolate and... she has a lot of inspiration!!!      Anaïs Defort, Co-Founder and Product Manager Anaïs is the eldest of France's daughters, she is all about nature, well just like the rest of the family. She has a master in Business administration and a Diploma in Personal Care Development and Promotion so she is all about strategy and planning. She is definitely an overthinker. When we say think twice, Anaïs will think at least...hmm...ten times.
     Marc Rohr, Strategy Consultant
Marc is presently managing his dental clinic. He is a
workaholic as much as an aromaholic… He cannot wait to get retired from his
clinic to get involved in Wholistic Aroma. His first mission as a team’s member
will be to be the chocolate provider (remember…our team’s inspiration)…but we
all know he will do much more than that...     Anthony Dupuis, Operation Specialist and Problem
SolverAnthony is the one who thinks
outside the box. He worked for five years in supply chain management and is therefore the expert for all operations and workflow matters. He likes to work in the rush, so let's give him what he wants: orders, orders and orders Why we need your help? The money we are asking for would help us acquire our first inventory and get the online boutique going. Our timeline Let's make it whole Let's stand for Fair Natural Care 

Every bit of
help means the world to us.
Spreading the
word is key to helping us realize our goal:
Getting Wholistic Aroma off the ground and having a whole positive impact 
thanks to a 100% natural beauty.

Pourquoi acheter avec Wholistic Aroma? 


Opportunité économique pour les fermiers en développement durables. 
En achetant avec Wholistic Aroma vous donnez la priorité à des petits producteurs et fermiers en développement durable. En effet, chez Wholistic Aroma, nous faisons le sourcing en choisissant les meilleurs ingrédients produits en développement durable et agriculture raisonnée. 

C'est meilleur pour l'environnement grâce à leur agriculture durable. 
Cela leur permet de rester compétitif sur le marché et de gagner un revenu juste. 
Cela aide à garder la connaissance et les traditions ancestrales de leur agriculture. 

France en Nouvelle Calédonie visitant des vanilleraies
Parce que France sait pertinemment que nous ne devrions utiliser que des produits de grande qualité, elle s'engage à sourcer les ingrédients dans les pays dans lesquels c'est la spécialité. Par exemple, pour l'huile de Coco, Tamanu et Vanille, France a trouvé des fournisseurs au Vanuatu et en Nouvelle Calédonie pendant qu'elle habitait dans le Pacifique sud. Pour la lavande, France a pris contact avec des producteurs Provençaux, dans son pays d'origine. Elle est tellement passionnée qu'elle connait toutes les déclinaisons et variétés de lavandes en fonction du lieu de la culture, du versant sud ou du versant nord de la montagne, etc. 
 Anaïs & Anthony faisant du sourcing (heureux) de lavande en Provence


Aider une planète sans produits chimiques pour :
VOTRE SANTE
Il est assez alarmant de penser au nombre 515. Vous rappelez-vous c'est la quantité de produits toxiques dans les cosmétiques moyennes qu'une femme utilise tous les jours sur sa peau? 
Quand on sait que ces produits pénètrent la peau durant toute la journée, voyagent dans la circulation sanguine et restent dans nos corps pendant des années...il est évident que pour notre santé et celle de nos enfants, nous devrions utiliser des soins du corps 100% naturels!!! 
                                          

L'ENVIRONNEMENT 
En utilisant uniquement des ingrédients naturels, cela signifie que l'eau qui sort de votre douche, passe par les cours d'eau, les rivières et finit dans les océans sera sans danger pour les animaux et la qualité de l'eau. Par exemple, avec les microbilles utilisées dans la cosmétique, personne ne soupçonnait à quel point elles étaient dangereuses pour de nombreuses espèces animales marines jusqu'à récemment. Quel choc, quand les techniques et études de marché ont permis de démontrer l'impact dangereux de ces microbilles qui auraient pu simplement et facilement être remplacées par des ingrédients naturels. 
Combien de temps devons nous attendre avant de découvrir la prochaine vérité sur les produits chimiques utilisés dans nos cosmétiques?  
                                          


Pour une cosmétique abordable ET qualitative 
En achetant des ingrédients naturels et en faisant votre cosmétique maison, vous payez 100% du prix pour la qualité des ingrédients. 
En achetant des produits de cosmétiques classiques, (même certains ""naturels"") vous payez environ 15% pour les ingrédients (en restant large) et le reste des 85% est dédié au marketing, R&D, etc. Préférez vous nourrir votre peau avec des ingrédients de qualité ou du marketing? 
Participer à des opportunités d'emploi pour des personnes atteintes de handicap invisibles. 
Saviez vous que 19 millions de personnes parmi celles à qui l'on a reconnu un handicap lourd souffrent d'handicap invisible aux Etas-Unis? 
Ces personnes n'utilisent pas de canne ou quoi que ce soit comme dispositif d'aide et peuvent paraitre parfaitement en bonne santé. 
Ce dont elles ont besoin ce sont des conditions et heures de travail flexibles car il peut leur arriver de ne pouvoir se rendre au travail un jour, mais pourraient totalement être mieux le jour suivant et opérationnelles pour aller au travail. 
                                                                
Comme France Engels, la fondatrice, est atteinte de névralgie du trijumeau, elle est totalement consciente du problème que beaucoup de personnes atteintes de handicap invisible peuvent rencontrer. Son idée est donc d'ouvrir des postes à d'autres personnes atteintes de handicap invisible grâce à un plan d'horaires de travail modulables. 
En achetant avec nous, vous aidez donc aussi la communauté de personnes avec handicap invisible à garder une intégration sociale et des opportunités de travail. 

Rencontrez l'équipe Wholistic Aroma  
Chez Wholistic Aroma, c'est une histoire Mère et Fille.

                                       

     France Engels, Fondatrice et Master en Aromatherapy
France est PA-SSIO-NNEE d'aromathérapie, bien-être et soins du corps. Elle a commencé sa carrière en tant qu'ostéopathe, s'occupant d'humains et d'animaux. Elle a toujours vécu à la campagne et a grandi en Provence, dans le sud de la France, où elle a toujours utilisé les plantes et l'aromathérapie pour son bien-être et celui de sa famille. 
Il y a quelques années, elle a eu un nerf endommagé pendant une intervention chirurgicale et souffre depuis d'handicap invisible. Comme c'est une battante, elle souhaite combiner sa passion, son travail et donner de l'espoir à ceux dans la même situation, aidant ainsi toute la communauté d'handicapés invisibles. 
Son boost pour l'inspiration est le chocolat...et elle a beaucoup d'inspiration!!! 

     Anaïs Defort, Co-Fondatrice et Chef de Produit
Anaïs est la fille aînée de France et elle est pro nature, en fait, tout comme le reste de la famille. Elle a un master en Business Administration et un diplôme Australien  de Chef de Produits en cosmétique et soins du corps. Elle est donc orientée stratégie et planification. 
Diriez vous qu'elle est très réfléchie? Hmmm...disons que certains la surnomme  ""Calcul en Cours"" de temps à autre!    

     Marc Rohr, Consultant Stratégie
Marc gère actuellement sa clinique dentaire. Il est un ""workaholic"" autant qu'un ""aromaholic"". Il a hâte de prendre la retraite de sa clinique pour s'impliquer chez Wholistic Aroma. 
Sa première mission comme membre de l'équipe sera de fournir le chocolat (souvenez vous...l'inspiration de l'équipe), mais nous savons tous qu'il fera bien plus que ça.  

     Anthony Dupuis, Spécialiste Opération et logistique 
Anthony est celui qui pense hors des sentiers battus. Il a travaillé pendant cinq ans en gestion logistique, il est donc l'expert en ce qui concerne les flux de marchandises.  
Il aime travailler dans l'urgence, donc donnons lui ce qu'il attend : des commandes, des commandes et des commandes.

To service, to travel and meet other cultures are the things we are passion for.

<p><b>Who we Are</b></p>
<p><b>Pauline Williams</b> (Artist) and <b>Mitchell Goddin</b> (Teacher) are lovers of sharing great food and fine wines.</p>
<p>Together we will build and operate the <b>Treehouse Tapas and Wine Bar </b>(in Pemberton, Western Australia) a social, ambient small bar venue set among the Karri forest, drawing on the  nature of sharing food and good times typical of the Spanish Tapas Bar culture.</p>

<p>Hi, I’m Bill Anthony, founder
of Consumer Travel Seminars. But this story is not about travel. And it's not about me. It is about
helping a Ugandan orphanage, which my friend Anja Tumert brought to my
attention. In a country ravaged by AIDS, thousands of children have lost both
parents and, too often, key members of their extended family. Although Mother’s
Nest Orphanage was founded to help, and it certainly has, it is struggling. Its struggle is both to
survive and to become self-sustaining.</p>
<p>Gerald Tugume answered the orphans’
cries for help by founding Mother’s Nest Orphanage. Having himself been
orphaned as a young child, Gerald knows firsthand the profound sadness and
horror of that condition. Chances are, it is a plight beyond your experience.
Certainly, it is not within my experience. We can only imagine it. And the very thought is horrific. </p>
<p>Fortunately, a brighter picture
can be painted and a happier, hopeful reality achieved. You and I can help
clear the sky for the 130 orphans currently housed and educated by Mother’s
Nest Orphanage in Uganda. </p>
<p>They have land. Friends of
the orphanage are helping with the creation of a small farm.. Soon Mother’s Nest will be
able to raise its own food. Some of the children have noteworthy crafts skills.
Therein lies a source of income. Other ideas are being explored.</p>
<p>At this point, however, they
struggle to have enough food and frequently fall short. Sanitation, also, is an
issue. There is no plumbing, as we know it. Housing is grossly inadequate. Malnutrition
and inadequate sanitation write a recipe for illness.  Medical care is frequently either unavailable
or inadequate.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, all is not
bleak. A dollar in Uganda buys much more in that country than in the USA or
Western Europe. 130 children can be fed adequately for only $1500
per month. Mother’s Nest simply needs a little help from its friends. I am
their friend. Perhaps you are too. If not yet a friend, please join me in
extending a hand of friendship. If you have previously donated, please give a bit more. No donation is too small or too big. You may donate anonymously, if you wish. Let’s help
our friends become self-sustaining.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Why $5,000 is our campaign goal:</p> <ul> <li>$5000 US dollars is the monthly cost of adequate operation - just adequate, not optimum. Currently, funding is substantially inadequate.</li> <li>$1500 is the cost of feeding the 130 children.</li> <li>$2500 is needed for medical care.</li>
<li>$1000 covers educational materials and teacher salaries.</li>
<li>Donations of any size are welcome and truly help. In using PayPal, PLEASE DO NOT SELECT ""SALE or PAYMENT."" Choose ""GIFT"" or ""FRIENDS AND FAMILY."" This is to avoid having your donation treated as a commercial transaction, for which PayPal charges a fee.</li>
<li>You get the enduring gratitude of the orphans, staff and friends of Mother's Nest.

What We Need & What You Get Why $5,000 is our campaign goal:  $5000 US dollars is the monthly cost of adequate operation - just adequate, not optimum. Currently, funding is substantially inadequate. $1500 is the cost of feeding the 130 children. $2500 is needed for medical care.

You get the enduring gratitude of the orphans, staff and friends of Mother's Nest. There is also the priceless satisfaction of knowing you helped.    The Impact Given adequate funding, stable progress can be made toward becoming self-sustaining:  Single-handedly, neither you nor I can save the world, but our collective contributions can make a tangible difference.  Money from donations will be wired to Mother's Nest on a weekly or bi-weekly schedule. Given the urgency of the organization's needs, the bulk of funding raised will not be held until the end of this campaign. Documentation of transmission and receipt of funds will be posted on this site after each transaction is completed.
At the completion of the campaign a full accounting of all funds raised and funds sent to Mother's Nest will be posted. 
This campaign's fundraising team is composed entirely of unpaid volunteers.     Risks & Challenges  I see very little or no risk for us, the donors. It is the orphans who are at risk. The institution founded to help them cannot fulfill its mission without outside help.  Gerald Tugume, founder and director of Mother's Nest has proven his commitment. He has sold personal possessions and sacrificed in other ways for the sake of the orphanage, for the children who are so in need of help. Gerald and his Board of Directors are as focused on having Mother's Nest become self-sustaining as they are on handling immediate needs. Balancing both aims is quite the balancing act.     Other Ways You Can Help Money is very much needed, but there are other ways you can help.

<p><b>WHO WE ARE</b></p>
<p><b><u>Performing Life International, Inc. </u></b><b>(Fundación
enseñARTE)</b> is a
grassroots, nonprofit organization that empowers youth from some of the most impoverished
areas in Bolivia by teaching them performance and visual arts as productive
skills for avoiding drugs and delinquency while ensuring participants remain in
school and have a stable place to live.<span> 
Since 2006, when the first class of six kids practiced juggling in a
central plaza, PL has implemented free programs in social circus, music, educational
enrichment, health, human rights, and microenterprise, helping over 3,000 youth
and families create better futures through the arts. </span></p>
<p>Some of the kids we work with don’t
even have the money to eat each day. One of the participants recently told us
that the only time she eats a decent meal is at Performing Life. We also celebrate
each child’s birthday since most of them, upon entering the project, didn’t even
know their own age, let alone their birthday. These are just some of the ways
in which we seek to improve the futures of kids in Cochabamba. Today,<span>  the need for this lifeline out of poverty has
never been greater.</span></p>
<p><b>The Story Behind the Organization: </b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Performing Life and Social Circus with Bolivian Street
Kids</b></p>
<p>Performing Life was founded as so
many nonprofits have been: by one individual recognizing a pressing need in the
community and choosing to act.  For John Connell, Performing Life´s
founder, this moment came soon after he first arrived in Bolivia in 2003. </p>
<p>“Hi<b>, </b>I’m John and I am the founder of Performing Life. I came to
Bolivia after graduating high school at 16 and ended up deciding to stay. As would
most naïve 16 year olds, I didn’t think about the long-term consequences of not
getting on the plane home. I eventually ran out of money and had no place to
live. With no money, no job, no return ticket home and a minimal knowledge of
the Spanish language, I had to make ends meet however possible.<span>  After a few weeks of living on the streets
and sleeping on friends’ floors, I saw a kid juggling at a stoplight and
thought, ‘Hey, I can do that!’</span></p>
<p>“Since the first day I started
juggling I began to see my economic situation improving.<span>  I rented a small room and got off the
streets. Working on the streets, I experienced first hand many of the problems
that affect child workers: hunger, drug abuse, violence, social exclusion,
exploitation, and, in some cases, death. </span></p>
<p>“During that time, I got to know a lot
of kids on a personal level, some of whom I am still in contact with, like
Adalid and Escarlet (who you can see in the video). So I thought, ‘If some
gringo who doesn’t even speak Spanish can make it in Bolivia, why can’t kids
already living here do the same thing?’ </p>
<p>“So in 2005 we started Performing
Life to empower youth who live and/or work on the streets of Cochabamba,
Bolivia by teaching circus skills to help them earn more money in less time, have
more time to go to school, and, through our work with their families,<span>  ensure that they have the chance to stop
working and lead the life that every child deserves.”</span></p><p><span></span></p><p></p>

<p><b>WHAT WE WANT</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>While helping 50 kids is great, we
want to help MORE! But we need your help to make this project happen. In order
for us to effectively help more kids and families, we need to establish two
satellite offices in outlying areas of Cochabamba because so many of the most
needy families can’t even afford the 25 cents it costs to get to the PL offices.<span>  With this new project, we will serve over 10 different communities
full of kids who want to experience the joy of circus.</span></p>
<p>In 2014, we completed a pilot
project in outlying areas where over 100 new kids participated. By operating on a small budget and keeping staff to a minimum, we assure
that the majority of funding goes directly to benefit the kids and their
families. </p>
<p>Funding from this campaign supports
creative activities four days per week reaching over 50 youth in two satellite locations: <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1391905/files/20150417093403-P3261610.JPG?1429288443"" src="""" style=""width: 607.774px; height: 454px;""/></p>

<p><b><u>WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT?</u></b></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p><b><u>The Streets of Bolivia</u></b></p>
<p>Bolivia has the highest poverty rate
in South America, with two-thirds of its 10 million people living in
poverty.<span>  Nationally, almost 900,000
children live and/or work on the streets in dangerous, degrading
conditions.  The population of homeless,
abandoned, and extremely poor children is exploding as hundreds of thousands of
indigenous families migrate from the countryside into illegal settlements
surrounding urban areas.  Extreme
economic difficulties lead to children as young as 4 working long hours to
support themselves or contribute to supporting their families.</span></p>
<p><b>Social Circus</b> is a transformative tool, a lifeline for street kids to create
solidarity, mutual support, and collective action for success.<span>  Studies have documented that regular
participation in circus arts improves educational attainment and enhances
social skills such as self-confidence and group cooperation.  Social Circus engages youth with analyzing
their present realities; communicating with parents, local governments,
schools, and leaders; connecting with resources; being responsible participants
in their own education; and creating positive futures.</span></p>

Program that supports land purchases, home construction, education, and small
business development; and
· 
What
every child deserves –
opportunities for discovery, play, and growth in a creative, positive environment.
WHAT WE WANT

While helping 50 kids is great, we
want to help MORE! But we need your help to make this project happen. In order
for us to effectively help more kids and families, we need to establish two
satellite offices in outlying areas of Cochabamba because so many of the most
needy families can’t even afford the 25 cents it costs to get to the PL offices.  With this new project, we will serve over 10 different communities
full of kids who want to experience the joy of circus.
In 2014, we completed a pilot
project in outlying areas where over 100 new kids participated. By operating on a small budget and keeping staff to a minimum, we assure
that the majority of funding goes directly to benefit the kids and their
families. 
Funding from this campaign supports
creative activities four days per week reaching over 50 youth in two satellite locations: 

· Schedule:  2:00 – 6:00 p.m. Tuesday through Friday.
· Activities:  Social Circus Classes, Educational
Enrichment, and a Meal at the end of class.
· 
Free monthly
performances for communities and schools.
Youth learn performing skills such
as juggling, diabolo, poi, aerial acrobatics, hand-to-hand acrobatics,
improvisational theater, clowning, and more. 
Check out some of their amazing circus acts in this
video!
Basic costs for the two outreach centers are: 
· 
Stipends for
Social Circus interns 16 and older who have at least four years training with
PL;
· 
Quality circus
arts equipment for classes and performances;
· 
Healthy meals
from food purchased locally;
· 
Part-time
salaries for mothers to prepare meals in the cafeteria, providing them with
stable employment;
· 
Setting up two
spaces for classes, cafeteria, outreach, educational enrichment, and parent
meetings.

WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT?

The Streets of Bolivia
Bolivia has the highest poverty rate
in South America, with two-thirds of its 10 million people living in
poverty.  Nationally, almost 900,000
children live and/or work on the streets in dangerous, degrading
conditions.  The population of homeless,
abandoned, and extremely poor children is exploding as hundreds of thousands of
indigenous families migrate from the countryside into illegal settlements
surrounding urban areas.  Extreme
economic difficulties lead to children as young as 4 working long hours to
support themselves or contribute to supporting their families.
Social Circus is a transformative tool, a lifeline for street kids to create
solidarity, mutual support, and collective action for success.  Studies have documented that regular
participation in circus arts improves educational attainment and enhances
social skills such as self-confidence and group cooperation.  Social Circus engages youth with analyzing
their present realities; communicating with parents, local governments,
schools, and leaders; connecting with resources; being responsible participants
in their own education; and creating positive futures.


Just take a look at our results so far!


Performing Life outcomes since 2006:
· 
All
participating youth are living with their families or in youth homes.
· 
All are
attending school regularly and have improved their grades.

· 
Youth are
awarded scholarships to study English at the Bolivian-American Center.  
· 
Youth are
graduating from high school and entering university.  
· 
Older youth are
employed as instructors, training the next group of leaders. 
· 
20 youth
instructors and performers participated in a series of Social Circus
development programs with internationally renowned organizations such as Cirque
du Monde and the Incandescence Circus Theater Company.  
· 
22 songs
written and composed by youth in the Music Program were signed by Heavy Hitters
Music, international agents for media productions.  
· 
Youth in the
microenterprise program have savings to use for educational expenses, small
businesses, and building safe, decent homes.
· 
Several mothers
have dignified jobs with PL, earning much-needed income.
· 
Three PL
instructors were contracted for a week-long Artist Residency in an Idaho public
school, sharing youth accomplishments and Bolivian culture with an entire
community.

Over 200 free
performances, concerts and events have been presented throughout the Cochabamba
area.

I am a late starter, 52 years old Hungarian woman who lives in the most beautiful part of the planet: Dingle Peninsula, County Kerry, IRELAND. I moved here less than a year ago, because of my longing to the sea and the mountains. I am a professional Orthopaedic massage therapist (www.achebusters.ie), but to build a clientele takes years. On the verge of being homeless, I had an entrepreneurial idea. 
I would like to bring the playfulness out of the tourists of Dingle town, and let them pretend they are Irish. Traditional Irish clothes and mythical costumes are needed and with my borrowed Nikon D80 good photographs will be taken. The pictures can be owned on the original SD card, copied on a disk and/or printed, of course. 
It is fun and it works very well in America: just check out Paul Gunn's Studio in Canada, or Oldtimephotos.org!
Dingle is very interesting place and a world class destination; but it does not hurt to have another attraction, for the rainy days...:-)
So simple, isn't it?

Well, in March I have taken out a loan of 1600 Euro, leased a small commercial unit on an excellent location, have it painted, have a mural painted for a backdrop, new lights, curtains, borrowed a camera and tripod, rented theatrical and party costumes for two months, printed 5000 flyers and spreading. I know, this business does not rely on returning customers: continuous advertising is vital.......


 But by now I have run out of money. And the tourists are still not coming....



The hardship of finding costumes, quality, usable costumes, fitting at least 3 or more sizes, male and female, and not to mention the children sizes, dawned on me after one month intensive looking and searching. 



It turns out, the costumes must be custom made, with open back, fit over the street clothes, approximately USD 300 for a piece.

So, the life of this enterprise now in your hands (emotional blackmail warning!), because the tourist season will start in June and without costumes all my efforts will be useless. 


6000 USD buys 20 costumes: 
2 Leprechaun, 2 Leprechauness, 
2 St. Patricks, 2 Goddesses,
2 Irish dancer girl, 2 boy, 
2 Leprechaun boy, 2 girl, 
2 Victorian female, 2 male.
The traditional Irish clothes can be found in charity shops.
These are the minimum requirements to make it work. And I still will be in trouble, if a Hen party wants to dress up as Leprechaunesses...:-)
If some money left, it goes on props (musical instruments, spin, hats, decoration), backgrounds (150 a piece, custom printed), and a real good photo printer (starts at 1000). (Right now I have a Lexmark 4650 :-)
Also I would like to print a leaflet: ""About Leprechauns and Fairies"". I have found very interesting, hardly known facts about them on the internet and in local bookstores. (Just for a taste: There is no such thing as a female Leprechaun.) Thus lightly educate the visitors from other countries.
It will be a great adventure! 
Please, help me to prepare properly until the tourist season kicks in in June-July-August.
Every contribution is appreciated and deserves a special Irish perk. If you don't find anything you like, you may ask!

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">FAQ's</h3>
<p><b>Going Green: How will that work?</b></p>
<p>In general, the idea behind having
the kitchen, market, cafe and gardens as a whole entity will be the key in
keeping things green all around. For example, food items that are about to be
unusable in the cafe or market will be used for the cooking classes, while
wasted food from the cafe can be composted for use in the gardens. The market
will also use limited to no packaging, as that is a key item that ends up in
your trash. Recycling will also be used whenever possible and classes will
provide insight on waste management for food entrepreneurs looking to keep
their businesses green while saving money at the same time.</p>
<p><b>The Kitchen:</b></p>
<p><b>What will the hours of the kitchen
be?</b></p>
<p>Our commissary kitchen we be
accessible 24/7 as long as prior notice is given so we can make sure you have a
key card and someone there to help out in case you need it. </p>
<p><b>How can I make sure no one else uses
the food I store at the commissary kitchen?</b></p>
<p>Our walk-in refrigerator and freezer
will have caged shelf dividors to make sure each food vendor has their own
locked area for storage. This not only ensures no one else uses your food but
also makes sure there is no cross contamination.</p>
<p><b>Can pre existing businesses also use
the commissary kitchen?</b></p>
<p>Yes, absolutely! Anyone who needs to
rent the space they need can do so.</p>
<p><b>Will I be responsible for cleaning
the kitchen after I use it?</b></p>
<p>Yes you will be required to do so.
We will provide the cleaning supplies but since it is a community kitchen we
will require everyone to be responsible for their own mess. Failure to do so
could result in suspension of use for the kitchen.</p>
<p><b>Will I need to provide my own food
items for the food I intend to cook in the kitchen?</b></p>
<p>Yes you will, but as soon as the
market opens you will be able to purchase anything you run out of or may have
forgotten right next door! At your convenience.</p>
<p><b>Can I bring my child/children to the
community education classes?</b></p>
<p>For the classes where engaging your
kids is part of the curriculum they are very welcome, and age specifications
will be posted with each course. There will also be classes specifically for
other age groups including adolescents, teens, adults, etc.</p>
<p><b>The Cafe:</b></p>
<p><b>What will the hours of the cafe be?</b></p>
<p>For now the hours will be a regular
morning to mid evening shift, so roughly 6 am to 6 pm depending on the day of
the week. As business grows so will our hours.</p>
<p><b>Will all food and drinks in the cafe
be local organic?</b></p>
<p>Yes, and that will never waiver. The
transparency of our market and business model will give you the ability to see
for yourself as well because these days you can never be too careful. In fact,
we encourage you to be thorough, not just with us, but with any other food
business.</p>
<p><b>Can I purchase ingredients from the
market that are used in food items for the cafe?</b></p>
<p>Yes, and you can also learn how to
cook them in one of our community classes! That is part of the beauty of having
them all linked together.</p>
<p><b>The Market:</b></p>
<p><b>Why is the market opening later then
the cafe and kitchen?</b></p>
<p>The kitchen and cafe will be
launched in January, and because the market will be selling mostly produce and
foods from local farmers, it is more sound to open it during their harvest
season. The market will have a soft opening with the kitchen and cafe, selling
a few items here and there but will be fully open in May of 2016. We are aiming
to keep it open year round afterwards with the use of our vertical gardens and
aquaponic systems.</p>
<p><b>If I find an item I love to use in
the kitchen, can I purchase it in the market?</b></p>
<p>Yes, with a few small exceptions
here and there when it comes to very large items, which we will sell smaller
versions of instead. </p>
<p><b>Will you be selling recipes used in
classes in case I don't want to take them or miss one?</b></p>
<p>Yes, the market will be stocked with
local updated cook books from chefs around Salt Lake City.</p>
<p><b>Also, wtf is a mycologist?</b></p>
<p>Someone who deals with fungus. So,
grows mushrooms really. Yum :)</p>

</div></div>","WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT:  How far has your food traveled to get on your plate? How many people have handled it before it got there? What is the nutritional value by the time it enters your body? The answers to these questions are probably a lot worse then you thought, but we have found a solution! Revolution United and Utah Eats have united local businesses, farmers, governments and chefs together with you, the
people, to create the People's Choice Food Hub here in Salt Lake where affordable organic food
can be purchased, prepared, learned about and eaten. Here is what will be included in the Food Hub:  Food and Food Business Education Community Supported Commissary Kitchen Organic Cafe
Locally Sourced Market with Urban Gardening Resources
Aquaponic and Rooftop Gardens
Special Events
   Why We Need a Food Hub in Salt Lake City There are several reasons why a Food Hub is needed in our city, including:  Limited access to affordable local food. Community interest about how to properly and in a timely manner learn to grow, cook, prepare and store healthy food.
Lack of a central hub for urban and aquaponic gardening education and resources.
Large quantities of waste produced by local food businesses who are unaware of the savings that could be implemented by going green. An absence of socio-ecominic investment into local businesses.
Local farmers and artisans with no yearly access to a secure outlet for their products and produce.


    The Details 

The Commissary Kitchen ""the heart"":  Specifically designed areas of the kitchen can be rented out to cater to different food entrepreneurs needs such as gluten free, vegan, kosher, baking, etc. A large area will be dedicated to the various educational classes which will be taught throughout the year including urban gardening start up, aquaponic systems and how they work, how to prepare food within limited time frames, the importance of a healthy diet, etc.
It will be a perfect spot for food trucks to prep, be stored, and handle waste.
Classes and local chefs will produce weekly meals and products to be sold and picked up at the market and cafe. 



The Market ""the mind"":


Every single item in the market will be local, organic, and full of the nutrition they are meant to have! 
Kombucha, ice cream, mushrooms, fermented veggies, etc will be made in our kitchen and sold in the market. No longer will your processed food have traveled thousands of miles and lost nutritional value to get to your plate!
You will be given the education to learn how to grow your own urban gardens and then be able to walk over to our market and buy all of the resources you have been taught to use.
It will supply affordable ingredients for the food entrepreneurs to help them move to a more sustainable and organic direction.





The Cafe ""the soul"":



The cafe will be the forefront and introduction to the operation where you will be able to sample some of our foods, buy pre prepared non processed meals, and speak with knowledgeable employees who can briefly answer any of your questions.
The modern industrial design will be crucial in providing a laid back and peaceful environment for our patrons to hang out and meet other like minded people, enjoy our organic food and beverages, and just have a place to relax.

<p>Beagard activity collar creates a deeper connection between you and your best friend. It helps you to understand your friends' real needs and even prevent future injuries.</p>
<p>Today, dogs suffer from similar lifestyle related illnesses as we humans do. Some dogs suffer from inactivity while others spend most of their time in agility training. Both can be harmful if the dogs welfare is not correctly understood – so ensure your friends wellbeing day and night. With the Beagard activity collar and mobile application you can balance your friends' activity and calorie intake, set short and long-term goals and share activity &amp; achievements with friends, and when needed, with a vet.</p>

<p>A gem on the Mediterranean coast, Barcelona has become the forth most visited city in Europe. The city is energetic, stylish and cultural. All year long sunny and mild climate, a perfect combination of cultural city trip and relaxing beach holiday. There were more than 7 millions visitors last year. Besides tourists we also have our 1.5 million strong trendy locals, who love to try new flavours.<br/>
</p>
<p> If you have visited Barcelona you would know the city itself is not big at all. Both the tourists and locals tend to hang around in a few neighbourhoods. For example the old city/ ciutat vella, where the city centre located, is less than 5 km sq. large. It is a labyrinth of narrow streets, gothic buildings, full of bars, restaurants and shops. The tourists season is from April to October where the city is bursting with life and movement.                                                                                                                                                                                                 <br/></p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Surely we are not the only one in town who sees this golden opportunity to open a new business. Recent years we have seen a surge of hipsters bar, cafe and bakeries. There are the traditional bakeries, serving Spanish bread, pastries, very few choices of cakes and not so creative. There are cafes with good cakes, but they have like 3 cakes sitting on the counter for customers to eat in.  There are the hipsters cup cake shops that it seems the cup cakes look better then the taste. We see a gap in the market that hasn't been filled in yet: a takeaway cake shop serving fresh cakes made from fresh ingredients, we are offering choices, qualities and taste. We will have set the prices competitive to keep the products turnover rate high. (Fresh cakes are always better!) We know we are newbies on the field, we are open for competitions but at the same time we are not competing with hundreds years old patisserie in Paris or Vienna. Barcelona is a market with great potential. Our qualities will help us succeed.</span><br/></p>
</div>
<p>The shop will be beautifully designed. (we will post the design and artworks on facebook--check it for updates!) We will have a most welcoming shop front and stylish interior. Due to cost control we will rent a small-medium space as long as it is large enough for a bakery. We will make the best use of the space available.  </p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>

We promise to make the best use of that to bring you fresh and seasonal cakes. We will try to use as little processed ingredients as possible and buy products from local farmers' markets. Besides classic cakes and pastries we will be creative and bring you bold new flavours that makes you keep coming back!<br/><br/><p>We are committed to be environmentally friendly. All waste will be separated and recycled. Packaging will be made with recycled material if possible. We will encourage the customers to bring their own boxes. We want to reduce food waste to a minimal level.</p>
<h3>We will be nice to our staff</h3>
<p>Happy staff make customers happy. We are happy to see our staff happy and customers happy. When we are happy we will make better cakes and make our customers happier. (Ok that can goes on forever) the point is everybody will be happy. We are saying this because Barcelona is full of narrow-minded stingy bosses that want to squeeze the last penny out of their staff while wasting money on stupid purchases or inefficient policies. That is not the way to run a successful business.  We know good staff is hard to come by. We promised we will treat our staff with respect and fairness, and keep up good communication. Pasteleria Celeste not only makes great cakes, it's also a great place to work! <br/></p>

<h3>About the creator</h3>
<p>Rita started baking relatively late, in her uni senior exchange study year. She had an amazing baker friend and she was addicted to baking ever since. She had been feeding all her previous colleagues in Barcelona various cakes in a regular basis and she volunteered to bring cake whenever there was a birthday. She was born in Hong Kong and moved to Europe after finishing uni. She has Hong Konger's super competitiveness  (to have a shop in Hong Kong is a cut-throat business!) and knows Barcelona long enough to get her way around. Barcelona was (and still is) full of dead end jobs. She had several of them and she was fed up. Now she is determined to make a new start. When she is not baking Rita is probably painting Barcelona's street scene and going to gigs. <br/></p>

</div><div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Any business start-up carries risks, and we are prepared to encounter many obstacles on the way. The first (and the biggest) challenge will be to find a good location, affordable and with loads of foot traffic (doesn't have to be in the most touristy strip of the city, like Las Ramblas tends to be full of tacky shops and restaurants while the rent has rocketed). After locating the shop we would need the city counsel to approve us opening a cake shop there. We hope to identify several possible shop locations in case the city counsel rejects our first application. Once we obtain the approval we will start the construction and things go from there.</p>
<p>We always keep in mind that this is Spain and basically anything you think it is unimaginable can happen. Almost all construction finishes late. Very late. All sorts of fraudsters ready to lure you with scams. We already mentally prepared for all the things that can go wrong. (Fingers crossed the city counsel doesn't give us a hard time for the permits) We will keep our heads and deal with any obstacles with our determination, ingenuity and resourcefulness. Nothing will stop us until we achieve our goal!       <br/> </p>

Sun, beach, sea, seafood, blue sky and beer...wait, there's something missing--delicious cakes! Everyone deserves a heavenly (Celeste) piece of cake. Pasteleria Celeste is a cake shop in Barcelona centre that will serve you both traditional and modern creative cakes, pastries and sandwiches. 


If you are thinking, why the hell is a Cantonese movie clip doing here?? Well, because this is a legendary quote that we want to share:

like to be a brand in the Michiana area, this is where we need your help!


Branding the Bakery is about creating a cohesive look a ""brand awareness"" of what we are developing at Local Foods Bakery.   We want the community, the neighbors to be part of something awesome; the mountain is big - with your help we can climb it together & you get a Perk for helping - how cool is that?

What We Need  




 The project needs $20,000, $10,000 of the funds we will start the Branding part by purchasing Labels, Banners, Street signs, Advertising- TV, Radio, Magazines (local). 

Once we start the marketing campaign we are expecting business to triple in volume so we are using $10,000 to purchase Bakery display cases, 2 work tables, 20 quart mixer, misc small kitchen tools. We need to remove a couple of walls to increase the flow of customers, us and future employees.  
A packaging space will be sharing the room with the Bakery display cases this is the yellow room with a Window.  
What You Get
Our perks are AWESOME: $250 will get you a year of pies once a month you can have all of your favorites. $50 will get you free coffee for a year along with an awesome coffee mug ; and for just $25 you will get our #1 rated cinnamon rolls. Good food, Great coffee, Birthday cakes, Cookies.... What more could a local / regional foodie want??   How about a $75 perk for Bread of the month- sample the white, the Oatmeal, the Sourdough... My mouth is watering just thinking about these Fantastic offers!

 When we reach certain dollar amount goals we will be using the monies as follows-
The
     first $5000 raised will go towards signage,
     labels, banners, paper ads etc. . 
The second $5000 will finish our Branding with TV &
     radio ads purchased.

     $5000 will be used to knock down some walls, buy our Bakery display units
     and tables.  All remaining funds will be used to purchase small kitchen appliances, with the 20 qt. Mixer at

<p>There will be a program opening soon in Cleveland, Ohio that
will help address many needs &amp; issues.</p>
<p>Project RBD will be a dynamic,
diverse community connector in Ohio, that will work as a
bridge between cultures, community, and individuals. We don’t only want to help rebuild hope, but also
contribute to the positive development of our communities in Ohio and
nationwide. We will stress on getting drug addicts and the
homeless off the street and into a job, racial reconciliation, helping
immigrants, assisting veterans, uniting families &amp; communities, addressing
violence, stopping gang activity, and much more.</p>
<p>What happens once we start helping those in need of our

<p>We will have started to reduce the cost of law enforcement, jails,
hospital &amp; mental health visits, the dependency off of welfare &amp; food
stamps, and reduction in crime.</p>
<p>Then what happens is that these families or individuals
start to spend money in their communities, they support local business, they
pay taxes, and help make the bonds of community stronger.</p>
<p>I want you to imagine the ripple effect this will have out
in many of our communities here in Ohio and nationwide.</p>

are not asking for charity, a hand out, or donations but an investment in all of our futures.</p>

I want you to imagine the ripple effect this will have out
in many of our communities here in Ohio and nationwide.
So, what I am proposing to all of you out there is that we
are not asking for charity, a hand out, or donations but an investment in all of our futures.

   
The Center will operate to address their needs:
from finding a home, to provide them with legal assistance gaining green cards,
citizenship, and work authorizations.Immigration
in Ohio.Ohio boast a blend of national
origins and cultural identifications. Our region’s economic growth is related to the influx of new
Americans who are here to find stable employment, reunite with their families,
or to escape violence or persecution. Ohio is better off because of recent
arrivals and new citizens, as immigrants play a significant role in our
communities and add value in considerable ways. Immigrants:

• 
Revitalize our urban and rural communities that
previously struggled with population decline;
• 
Increase the number of new residents, taxpayers,
consumers, homeowners, and entrepreneurs, all of which boost our economic
stability;
• 
Expose our youth to cultural diversity and add to
classroom learning opportunities;
• 
Fill essential positions in STEM professions and the
agriculture, service, food processing, and meatpacking industries that are
almost entirely dependent on their labor.


We will add capacity to add enough
multi-lingual resources to make sure we, too, are responsive to the needs of
people who are not just Hispanic but are from all parts of the world as well
who seek legal assistance gaining green cards, citizenship, and work
authorizations which enable them to contribute to the positive development of
our communities. These are our new neighbors and future leaders and they need
our help navigating barriers in our complex and imperfect immigration system.

As a future coalition of workforce development and adult education service providers,Project Rebuild volunteers & staff members will work together on behalf of Ohio & US residents facing the highest barriers to obtain employment.These good jobs then lead to economic self-sufficiency and off of the dependency of the welfare system thus creating a societal,economic, and community impact. We will work to make sure that every Ohio & US resident has the chance to prepare for, find, and keep a good job.





The horizons program will be a special developmental program that will incorporate the input of our community and organizations to partner with each other. If we do not work together and start outreach to help each other curb violence of any kind, we will just see each others family and friends in body bags. 






Your investment will create a better community. You will create jobs already with us being able to hire staff within the community center.
We will reduce the cost of law enforcement, jails,
hospital & mental health visits, the dependency off of welfare & food
stamps, and reduction in crime.
Families or individuals
will start to spend money in their communities, they will support local businesses, pay taxes, and help make the bonds of our communities stronger.
Again lets imagine the ripple effect this will have out
in many of our communities here in Ohio and nationwide.



Project RBD will uphold its integrity by committing to financial transparency. Which means we will have two town hall meetings a year that is open to everyone from local communities and we will discuss how funds are being used.

We need to raise at least $350,000 in contributions but if we can raise more that means their is more that we can do. We
need to pay bills, furniture, office supplies, remodeling, salaries for staff,
liability insurance, and any other expenses for at least the next couple of years. We
also want to pay for the 501c3 application fee. We are entirely funded through
private donations currently: we can not receive no government funding or tax deductible donations until we obtain our 501c3 charitable determination letter.

    



We have added a bunch of perks to
thank you for your contribution.

</p><p>With your support, we'll launch a dance club called Neuro
Vexx – playing sci-fi inspired techno, psytrance and breaks all night in a
trippy environment where you can dress up and escape reality. It will start in
Los Angeles, CA and grow to become an event that happens in cities around the
world. In each location, we'll rent an existing nightclub venue and transform
it into a totally new experience for an evening.</p>
<p>A lot of us
grew up watching futuristic clubs in sci-fi movies. We dreamed of actually
going to places filled with such interesting music and people. But by the time
we were old enough to be granted IDs that unlocked the golden doors of the
nightclub, we walked through to discover disappointment. Corporate music.
Creepy people. Not enough art or imagination. Clubs started to feel more like
work parties or high school dances. We went to escape what’s wrong with the
world but ended up being reminded of it. It's time to fix this problem.</p>

<p>Clubs should be a place where we feel safe to meet new people
and strengthen our bonds with friends. Fellow club goers are our extended
families – sometimes offering more love and support in critical times than our
parents or siblings. A feeling of community happens when people are brought
together by a passion – like at comic
and sci-fi conventions. We want to bring this sense of togetherness to the club
scene. Neuro Vexx will be a place where you can dress up in your
favorite outfits – the ones that express who you really are – meet people who
share your views and hear the latest sounds in dance music from true artists.</p>

crowdfunding campaign is to get our first event off the ground, which will take
place on Saturday July 11 in Hollywood, CA. We’ll then build on this success
and create more nights around the world. Some of the things you'll
experience: </span><br/>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>The latest in dark, trippy techno, psytrance and breaks - the kind of music you usually have to trek to festivals or undergrounds to hear.</li>
<li>Theme nights where you can
     dress in a costume inspired by a movie, game, graphic novel and more.</li>
<li>An open, accepting atmosphere –
     you can even ignore the theme and wear whatever you want.</li>
<li>A place where you can be a
     single female (or married) and know you won’t have to deal with relentless
     advances from creepy guys while the security guards ignore you. We all
     know where the line is. Anyone steps over it- game over.</li>
<li>Interesting new music – not the
     corporate stuff or the retro songs you’ve heard over and over again.</li>
<li>Lots of fun stuff to do if you
     don’t dance but just want to come, hang out and be part of a scene.</li>
<li>The chance to experience your
     favorite video games and films during the night.</li>
<li>A live action sci-fi gaming
     experience you can play at the club. LARP meets ARG. Find other players
     and game characters during the night to solve challenges and earn EXP.
     Level up for perks and prizes. </li>
</ul>
<p>We'll also
be DJing and performing live at Neuro
Vexx. Our act is called Spanking Machine. Our DJ sets combine original music
featuring live vocals with sci-fi inspired tracks from like-minded artists. We
play techno, breaks, psy-trance and other underground styles. Our sound is
like the music in a game, with a mix of styles and energy that takes you on a
journey throughout the evening. You may have seen us during one of our hometown
Los Angeles shows or on the road in places like Chicago, Miami, Atlanta and
Tokyo. We can't wait to bring our latest show to you.</p>

<p>So how did we get the idea to do this? As musicians and DJs,
the change in the club scene has hit us pretty hard. We realized something new
was needed as we were planning a recent tour. Many alternative clubs we had
played in the past had closed. The reason: Venues wanted to give the space to
corporate EDM clubs. To compete, some clubs were forced to stop playing new
music and cater to the retro audience. After weeks of scouring the web, we
couldn’t find one place that we were excited about playing. We got bummed for a
while. We tried to fulfill our creative needs by doing online shows. But we
came back to the conclusion that dance music can’t be fully appreciated without
the energy of a room full of people experiencing an amazing journey together. We noticed a lot of comments on our Soundcloud sets saying our mixes reminded people of sci-fi movie soundtracks or the music in games. Those are two of our favorite things too. So this is a great opportunity to listen to our audience and give them something they really want.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div></div>","With your support, we'll launch a dance club called Neuro
Vexx – playing sci-fi inspired techno, psytrance and breaks all night in a
trippy environment where you can dress up and escape reality. It will start in
Los Angeles, CA and grow to become an event that happens in cities around the
world. In each location, we'll rent an existing nightclub venue and transform
it into a totally new experience for an evening.
A lot of us
grew up watching futuristic clubs in sci-fi movies. We dreamed of actually
going to places filled with such interesting music and people. But by the time
we were old enough to be granted IDs that unlocked the golden doors of the
nightclub, we walked through to discover disappointment. Corporate music.
Creepy people. Not enough art or imagination. Clubs started to feel more like
work parties or high school dances. We went to escape what’s wrong with the
world but ended up being reminded of it. It's time to fix this problem.







Clubs should be a place where we feel safe to meet new people
and strengthen our bonds with friends. Fellow club goers are our extended
families – sometimes offering more love and support in critical times than our
parents or siblings. A feeling of community happens when people are brought
together by a passion – like at comic
and sci-fi conventions. We want to bring this sense of togetherness to the club
scene. Neuro Vexx will be a place where you can dress up in your
favorite outfits – the ones that express who you really are – meet people who
share your views and hear the latest sounds in dance music from true artists.







This
crowdfunding campaign is to get our first event off the ground, which will take
place on Saturday July 11 in Hollywood, CA. We’ll then build on this success
and create more nights around the world. Some of the things you'll
experience: 



The latest in dark, trippy techno, psytrance and breaks - the kind of music you usually have to trek to festivals or undergrounds to hear.
Theme nights where you can
     dress in a costume inspired by a movie, game, graphic novel and more.
An open, accepting atmosphere –
     you can even ignore the theme and wear whatever you want.
A place where you can be a
     single female (or married) and know you won’t have to deal with relentless
     advances from creepy guys while the security guards ignore you. We all
     know where the line is. Anyone steps over it- game over.
Interesting new music – not the
     corporate stuff or the retro songs you’ve heard over and over again.
Lots of fun stuff to do if you
     don’t dance but just want to come, hang out and be part of a scene.
The chance to experience your
     favorite video games and films during the night.
A live action sci-fi gaming
     experience you can play at the club. LARP meets ARG. Find other players
     and game characters during the night to solve challenges and earn EXP.
     Level up for perks and prizes. 

We'll also
be DJing and performing live at Neuro
Vexx. Our act is called Spanking Machine. Our DJ sets combine original music
featuring live vocals with sci-fi inspired tracks from like-minded artists. We
play techno, breaks, psy-trance and other underground styles. Our sound is
like the music in a game, with a mix of styles and energy that takes you on a
journey throughout the evening. You may have seen us during one of our hometown
Los Angeles shows or on the road in places like Chicago, Miami, Atlanta and
Tokyo. We can't wait to bring our latest show to you.












So how did we get the idea to do this? As musicians and DJs,
the change in the club scene has hit us pretty hard. We realized something new
was needed as we were planning a recent tour. Many alternative clubs we had
played in the past had closed. The reason: Venues wanted to give the space to
corporate EDM clubs. To compete, some clubs were forced to stop playing new
music and cater to the retro audience. After weeks of scouring the web, we
couldn’t find one place that we were excited about playing. We got bummed for a
while. We tried to fulfill our creative needs by doing online shows. But we
came back to the conclusion that dance music can’t be fully appreciated without
the energy of a room full of people experiencing an amazing journey together. We noticed a lot of comments on our Soundcloud sets saying our mixes reminded people of sci-fi movie soundtracks or the music in games. Those are two of our favorite things too. So this is a great opportunity to listen to our audience and give them something they really want.

<p><b><br/></b></p><h1><b>The Impact</b></h1>
<blockquote>The Project will
benefit the population of Queralquchki and the physical and biological space
they inhabit.</blockquote>
<p>Greater <b>environmental
awareness</b> will be generated, especially amongst the children using the games.
They will learn to take care of their environment and will reduce the pressure
on the natural resources they use. As a result, the degraded environment will improve
and so will the living conditions of the population.</p>
<p>The children in
Queralquichki will <b>learn hands-on</b> how they can produce clean, renewable energy
from playing. They will be also taught about the different sources of energy
and their impacts in the environment; about saving; energy efficiency and
conservation. Indirectly adults will learn the same.</p>
<p>The Children will have
a physical, temporal and emotional space to play. <b>Play is a human right of
every child</b> as it contributes to their physical, cognitive, social and
emotional wellbeing. Playing allows them to use their creativity, develop their
imagination, improve their strengths, interact with their surroundings, conquer
fears, learn to work as a team, share, negotiate, resolve conflicts, make decisions,
discover areas of personal interest, among others.</p>
<p>Playing for
Development will improve the population’s <b>quality of life</b>: The energy produced
by the playground will allow them to light up their houses without having to
travel to the city to charge their cellphones (used as flashlights). The
children that have chores during the day, such as working in the fields, will
be able to access artificial light and study during the night. Access to light
increases productivity and enhances chances of<b> economic, personal and social
success</b>. </p>
<p>It is for said reasons
that Playing for Development will bring <b>intellectual development</b> to children,
<b>economic progress</b> and improvement in the population’s <b>living conditions</b> and
<b>environment</b>.</p>

<h2 style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>El Problema</b></h2>
<p>Contrario a lo que la mayoría cree, el aumento de riqueza que acompaña a
la mundialización <b>no</b> es el único problema que lleva a la degradación ambiental.
Los pobres dependen en gran medida de los recursos naturales para obtener
ingresos directos y como consecuencia degradan el ambiente. Asimismo, la
degradación del medio ambiente<b> profundizará</b> su pobreza. </p>
<p>Queralquichki, se ubica en los alrededores de la ciudad de Huancavelica,
Perú; donde viven alrededor de 30 familias (mayoritariamente agricultores y
ganaderos de subsistencia). Aquí, la mayoría de los pobladores tienen
<b>insatisfechas</b> las siguientes necesidades básicas como: Nutrición adecuada,
servicios de salud, sistemas de drenaje, agua potable o alcantarillado,
electricidad, letrinas, educación, acceso a comunicaciones, entre otras.</p>
<p>Por lo general, una población con escasos recursos, como lo es
Queralquichki,  posee un <b>nivel bajo de
educación</b> y una <b>mala calidad de vida</b>; por tanto, el entendimiento sobre el
ambiente que los rodea es pobre y les resulta de baja importancia cuidarlo.</p>
<p>Como consecuencia, la presión que se ejerce sobre los recursos naturales
frágiles aumenta y el ambiente se degrada; formando un <b>círculo vicioso</b> donde un
ambiente degradado empeora la calidad de vida de la población. </p>
<p>Dicha población <b>no conservará el ambiente</b> si no comprende el significado
de conservar el ambiente, cómo hacerlo y los beneficios que trae consigo; así
mismo, tampoco le dará una mayor prioridad ya que sus condiciones de vida
apenas les permiten sobrevivir. </p>
<p>Se debe abordar esta problemática en conjunto; mejorar las condiciones de
vida y el nivel de educación ambiental de la población para generar una mayor
conciencia ambiental. Solo así se podrá conservar el medio ambiente y mitigar
la pobreza.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><br/></b></p><h2 style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>La Solución</b></h2>
<p>Jugando por el Desarrollo consiste en <b>diseñar</b> y <b>construir</b> en Queralquichki
los siguientes juegos recreativos mecánicos generadores de energía: Un
carrusel, un columpio, y un sube y baja.</p>
<p>Dichos juegos permitirán transformar la energía generada con el uso que
le darán los niños, en <b>energía eléctrica</b>. La energía producida, se almacenará y
llevará a un centro de carga donde los pobladores podrán cargar sus celulares y
linternas sin tener que viajar hasta la ciudad.  Así, podrán <b>alumbrar</b> sus hogares por las
noches.</p>
<p>Se abordarán dos principales líneas de acción: </p><p></p><ol>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">La generación de
energía renovable para mejorar las condiciones de vida de la población, </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">La
provisión de herramientas educacionales para mejorar el nivel de educación
ambiental.</span><br/>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>Existe una relación importantísima entre la educación, calidad de vida y
la conciencia ambiental e incidiendo en los tres se puede llegar al desarrollo
sostenible. Asimismo el uso de energías renovables es la base para lograr este
desarrollo; como diría Ban Ki-Moon, secretario general de la ONU, “La energía sostenible
es el hilo de oro que conecta el crecimiento económico, un medio ambiente sano,
la equidad social y la igualdad de oportunidades”.</blockquote>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><br/></b></p><h2 style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>El Impacto</b></h2>
<blockquote>El Proyecto beneficiará a los pobladores de Queralquichki y al espacio
físico y biológico donde habitan.</blockquote>
<p>Se generará una mayor <b>conciencia ambiental</b>, en especial en los niños que
utilicen los juegos para obtener energía; aprenderán a cuidar el ambiente que
los rodea y se reducirá la presión ejercida sobre los recursos naturales
frágiles que utilizan. Como consecuencia el ambiente degradado mejorará y con
ello la calidad de vida de los pobladores también.</p>
<p>Los niños de Queralquichki <b>aprenderán</b> de manera directa y activa como
pueden producir energía eléctrica limpia y renovable a partir de la que
utilizan para jugar. Además, comprenderán las distintas fuentes de energía que
existen y cómo varias de ellas inciden en su salud y/o el ambiente; sobre el
ahorro; la eficiencia energética y la conservación. Indirectamente los adultos
aprenderán lo mismo. </p>
<p>Asimismo, los niños contarán con un espacio físico, temporal y emocional
para jugar. <b>El juego es un derecho humano de todo niño</b> pues contribuye a su
bienestar físico, cognitivo, social y emocional. Jugar les permite usar su
creatividad, desarrollar su imaginación, mejorar sus destrezas, interactuar con
sus alrededores, conquistar miedos, aprender a trabajar en equipo, compartir,
negociar, resolver conflictos, tomar decisiones, descubrir áreas de interés
personales, entre otros beneficios.</p>
<p>Jugando por el Desarrollo, <b>mejorará la calidad de vida</b> de los pobladores,
pues la energía producida por los juegos les permitirá alumbrar sus casas por
las noches sin la necesidad de tener que viajar hasta la ciudad para cargar sus
celulares, los cuales utilizan como linternas. Los jóvenes estudiantes que
tienen tareas durante el día, como dedicarse a la agricultura, no tienen
ninguna posibilidad de estudiar después de la escuela, ya que no cuentan con
luz artificial. Adicionalmente, el acceso a luz por la noche les permitirá ser
más productivos y tener <b>mayores posibilidades de triunfo laboral, personal y
social</b>. </p>
<p>Es por las razones antes expuestas, Jugando por el Desarrollo, traerá el <b>desarrollo intelectual</b> de los niños, <b>progreso económico</b> y una mejora en la
<b>calidad de vida</b> de la población y del 
<b>ambiente</b> que los rodea.</p>

Contrary to common

to environmental degradation. Poor people depend, in great measure, on natural
resources to obtain direct income and as consequence the environment is

As a result, the

By improving their

alleviation.
The Solution
Playing for
Development will design and build in Queralquichki an energy generating
playground consisting of the following games: a merry-go-round, a swing and a
see-saw.Said games will transform
the energy generated by the children while using the games into electrical
energy. The energy produced will be stored and transported to a loading center
where residents will charge their cellphones and flashlights without having to
travel to the city. Thus, they will be able to light their homes at night.
Two lines of action will
be addressed: 

The generation of renewable energy to improve the living
conditions of the population, 


The provision of educational tools to improve
the level of environmental education.

There is an important
relationship between education, quality of life and environmental awareness and
acting upon all three can accomplish sustainable development. Also the use of
renewable energy is the basis for achieving this development; as Ban Ki-Moon,
UN secretary general, says: ""Sustainable energy is the golden thread that
connects economic growth, increased social equity and an environment that
allows the world to thrive.""
The Impact
The Project will
benefit the population of Queralquchki and the physical and biological space
they inhabit.
Greater environmental
awareness will be generated, especially amongst the children using the games.
They will learn to take care of their environment and will reduce the pressure
on the natural resources they use. As a result, the degraded environment will improve
and so will the living conditions of the population.
The children in
Queralquichki will learn hands-on how they can produce clean, renewable energy
from playing. They will be also taught about the different sources of energy
and their impacts in the environment; about saving; energy efficiency and
conservation. Indirectly adults will learn the same.
The Children will have
a physical, temporal and emotional space to play. Play is a human right of
every child as it contributes to their physical, cognitive, social and
emotional wellbeing. Playing allows them to use their creativity, develop their
imagination, improve their strengths, interact with their surroundings, conquer
fears, learn to work as a team, share, negotiate, resolve conflicts, make decisions,
discover areas of personal interest, among others.
Playing for
Development will improve the population’s quality of life: The energy produced
by the playground will allow them to light up their houses without having to
travel to the city to charge their cellphones (used as flashlights). The
children that have chores during the day, such as working in the fields, will
be able to access artificial light and study during the night. Access to light
increases productivity and enhances chances of economic, personal and social
success. 
It is for said reasons
that Playing for Development will bring intellectual development to children,
economic progress and improvement in the population’s living conditions and
environment.

What We Need
Here is a breakdown of
how the money raised will be used:Other Ways You Can Help
If you can’t
contribute it doesn’t mean you can’t still help! Please spread the word about
this campaign by sharing it with your friends! You can use the Indiegogo share
tools!ESPAÑOLPara ver el video en español: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gr1DVb9cYQPor medio de la generación de la energía renovable utilizando juegos comunales, podremos lograr el desarrollo sostenible en Queralquichki.
El Problema
Contrario a lo que la mayoría cree, el aumento de riqueza que acompaña a
la mundialización no es el único problema que lleva a la degradación ambiental.
Los pobres dependen en gran medida de los recursos naturales para obtener
ingresos directos y como consecuencia degradan el ambiente. Asimismo, la
degradación del medio ambiente profundizará su pobreza. 
Queralquichki, se ubica en los alrededores de la ciudad de Huancavelica,
Perú; donde viven alrededor de 30 familias (mayoritariamente agricultores y
ganaderos de subsistencia). Aquí, la mayoría de los pobladores tienen
insatisfechas las siguientes necesidades básicas como: Nutrición adecuada,
servicios de salud, sistemas de drenaje, agua potable o alcantarillado,
electricidad, letrinas, educación, acceso a comunicaciones, entre otras.
Por lo general, una población con escasos recursos, como lo es
Queralquichki,  posee un nivel bajo de
educación y una mala calidad de vida; por tanto, el entendimiento sobre el
ambiente que los rodea es pobre y les resulta de baja importancia cuidarlo.
Como consecuencia, la presión que se ejerce sobre los recursos naturales
frágiles aumenta y el ambiente se degrada; formando un círculo vicioso donde un
ambiente degradado empeora la calidad de vida de la población. 
Dicha población no conservará el ambiente si no comprende el significado
de conservar el ambiente, cómo hacerlo y los beneficios que trae consigo; así
mismo, tampoco le dará una mayor prioridad ya que sus condiciones de vida
apenas les permiten sobrevivir. 
Se debe abordar esta problemática en conjunto; mejorar las condiciones de
vida y el nivel de educación ambiental de la población para generar una mayor
conciencia ambiental. Solo así se podrá conservar el medio ambiente y mitigar
la pobreza.
La Solución
Jugando por el Desarrollo consiste en diseñar y construir en Queralquichki
los siguientes juegos recreativos mecánicos generadores de energía: Un
carrusel, un columpio, y un sube y baja.
Dichos juegos permitirán transformar la energía generada con el uso que
le darán los niños, en energía eléctrica. La energía producida, se almacenará y
llevará a un centro de carga donde los pobladores podrán cargar sus celulares y
linternas sin tener que viajar hasta la ciudad.  Así, podrán alumbrar sus hogares por las
noches.
Se abordarán dos principales líneas de acción: 

La generación de
energía renovable para mejorar las condiciones de vida de la población, 


La
provisión de herramientas educacionales para mejorar el nivel de educación
ambiental.


Existe una relación importantísima entre la educación, calidad de vida y
la conciencia ambiental e incidiendo en los tres se puede llegar al desarrollo
sostenible. Asimismo el uso de energías renovables es la base para lograr este
desarrollo; como diría Ban Ki-Moon, secretario general de la ONU, “La energía sostenible
es el hilo de oro que conecta el crecimiento económico, un medio ambiente sano,
la equidad social y la igualdad de oportunidades”.
El Impacto
El Proyecto beneficiará a los pobladores de Queralquichki y al espacio
físico y biológico donde habitan.
Se generará una mayor conciencia ambiental, en especial en los niños que
utilicen los juegos para obtener energía; aprenderán a cuidar el ambiente que
los rodea y se reducirá la presión ejercida sobre los recursos naturales
frágiles que utilizan. Como consecuencia el ambiente degradado mejorará y con
ello la calidad de vida de los pobladores también.
Los niños de Queralquichki aprenderán de manera directa y activa como
pueden producir energía eléctrica limpia y renovable a partir de la que
utilizan para jugar. Además, comprenderán las distintas fuentes de energía que
existen y cómo varias de ellas inciden en su salud y/o el ambiente; sobre el
ahorro; la eficiencia energética y la conservación. Indirectamente los adultos
aprenderán lo mismo. 
Asimismo, los niños contarán con un espacio físico, temporal y emocional
para jugar. El juego es un derecho humano de todo niño pues contribuye a su
bienestar físico, cognitivo, social y emocional. Jugar les permite usar su
creatividad, desarrollar su imaginación, mejorar sus destrezas, interactuar con
sus alrededores, conquistar miedos, aprender a trabajar en equipo, compartir,
negociar, resolver conflictos, tomar decisiones, descubrir áreas de interés
personales, entre otros beneficios.
Jugando por el Desarrollo, mejorará la calidad de vida de los pobladores,
pues la energía producida por los juegos les permitirá alumbrar sus casas por
las noches sin la necesidad de tener que viajar hasta la ciudad para cargar sus
celulares, los cuales utilizan como linternas. Los jóvenes estudiantes que
tienen tareas durante el día, como dedicarse a la agricultura, no tienen
ninguna posibilidad de estudiar después de la escuela, ya que no cuentan con
luz artificial. Adicionalmente, el acceso a luz por la noche les permitirá ser
más productivos y tener mayores posibilidades de triunfo laboral, personal y
social. 
Es por las razones antes expuestas, Jugando por el Desarrollo, traerá el desarrollo intelectual de los niños, progreso económico y una mejora en la
calidad de vida de la población y del 
ambiente que los rodea.

<p><strong>WHAT’S IT ALL ABOUT? </strong></p>
<p>Happy Maki is growing and not just into a new space!</p>
<p>We’re really excited to share with everyone our next adventure. We’re bringing new life to a run down 50-seater restaurant in the heart of Brighton and here our food will be given as a gift.  </p>
<p>It all started with a passion to raise awareness of overfishing issues and how the sushi industry was contributing to this, whilst providing healthy fast food. After 3 long Summers of serving sushi at festivals up and down the country, we opened the doors to our small shop right next to Brighton Pier. </p>
<p>For each sushi wrap we sell we plant a tree and feed a child, along the way our amazing customers have supported us in planting 226,405 trees and providing 306,301 meals through our charity partners Eden Reforestation Projects and Marys Meals. </p>
<p>Our next big and exciting project is a new restaurant concept, a fast, healthy vegan menu specialising in sushi “rolls and bowls”, see the photo attached for the full menu.  With toppings from “salmon” sashimi to miso and ginger tempeh, it’s all the amazing flavours you know and love from our rolls with an exciting twist. </p>
<p>The real pioneering experiment is introducing gift economy using a modern and customer facing, pay as you feel till system.  The big goal is learning how to do business in a kinder and more regenerative way. By offering our sushi as a gift, and removing the demand from the usual transaction process we want to treat our customers more kindly.  We hope this will be felt, and that it will create a very special atmosphere in our restaurants.  This also opens the door to a healthy vegan meal for anyone who wouldn’t usually be able to afford it. </p>
<p>One of the main drivers of opening the new restaurant is to have a space to use where we can all connect and learn from each other. In the evenings we will be hosting documentary screenings, presentations, workshops and live music events. We’re excited to be able work with the community to create a space where great food and great conversation go hand in hand. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED </strong></p>
<p>We are hoping to raise £40,000 in funding. We are aware it’s a large amount of money but are also proud that we can do some amazing things for an old restaurant at a very reasonable cost for a full renovation.  The total cost of the project is £80,000 we will fund the remaining £40,000 with loans. </p>
<p>With outdated décor and a tired kitchen, everything needs to be stripped back and refurnished, it needs a lot of love. With truth as a guiding principle for Happy Maki, we feel it is important you understand where any donations are going. So we have created a pie chart below to show you what our budget currently looks like, which might also help anyone else thinking of opening a restaurant. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1586980612/aopwgqfmlbk29k4kd92e.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The The costs can be split into two categories</p>
<p>Acquiring the Lease 33% : Including rent deposit, premium, stamp duty &amp; solicitors fees. </p>
<p>Creating a Restaurant 66% : Kitchen equipment, bathroom refurbs, redecoration throughout, signage, locally made tables, wiring, plumbing, custom built rolling counter, air conditioning and labour costs. </p>
<p>We’re looking to bring it to life, where health café meets Japanese zen vibes, a fusion feel just like our food! We want to bring in a beautiful bamboo ceiling and locally made tables and benches, using environmentally friendly materials where possible but also focusing on durability and how easy surfaces are to clean and maintain. </p>
<p>On the new menu, ensuring we keep our kitchen refurb to essential equipment and costs as low as possible. All of our food is hand prepped, all sauces are homemade and we’re working towards being 100% gluten free.  This all means that the kitchen is simple and inexpensive to kit out. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT DO YOU GET ? </strong></p>
<p>As a business operating on gift economy, we are not offering set rewards.  As a not for profit company we are not offering equity in the business.  We envisage that the by donation crowdfunding campaign will be supported by people who are:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.  Keen to support the growth of Happy Maki.  </p>
<p>2.  Excited to be part of the gift economy experiment. </p>
<p>3.  Hungry to make a donation in advance for food at our shops or food trucks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Campaign contributes will also be invited to come and try the food and help us perfect our service process during a 4 day soft launch which will only be open to those who have donated.  A sneak preview of our first of its kind pay as you feel, vegan sushi bar. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We will also be holding live Q and A webinars for contributors, so you can chat to Anna about her plans and progress. </p>
<p>If you want to donate in advance for food it’s up to you how much you take for your donation, you will be able to let us know this through our till system in stores or by chatting to staff at our events. We really look forward to meeting and thanking you all and hopefully celebrating your contribution to a successful campaign.  We have also added suggested donations such as buying a meal for one or two in advance, for those wanting some price guidelines.</p>
<p> With your support, we can breathe new life into the amazing space, bring healthy vegan food to those in need and continue to help plant trees and feed children through our great charity partners! </p>
<p>We will also be creating a full business report on the process of turning a business to pay as you feel.  Explanations behind our decision, our budget and then actual costs, plus of course in-depth analysis of the donation data trends that we collect. This report will be put on our website for anyone to have access to. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE IMPACT </strong></p>
<p>This is the first time anyone will have experimented with pay as you feel in a fast food environment, with our new till system we will be collecting not only really insightful data on gifting patterns but we will also be refining a point of sale product that other businesses can use in today's modern and fast paced world. We believe in sharing freely ideas and products that promote positive growth so we can all improve and grow faster and together. </p>
<p>In supporting us not only are you providing an amazing gift but you become part of the exciting experiment towards positive change.  </p>
<p>The business started with a personal pot of £10,000 and we are very careful with the money we do spend. Up until this point we have grown organically through hard work reinvestment and reasonable director salaries.  We make sure money is being spent in the right places and we are resourceful alongside mindful of the resources we are using.  </p>
<p>As a team we believe passionately in what we are doing.  We want to protect and regenerate the environment and its wildlife whilst creating a kind and non-judgemental space where everyone can connect around a table, eating deliciously colourful fast food.  Most importantly we want to inspire people to drop their guards and open their hearts to the idea of giving gifts to benefit others.  We hope to prove that when you do business with these motives and desires that it is successful, even if we aren’t yet able to define exactly what this “success” might look like. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE RISKS AND CHALLENGES </strong></p>
<p>Some people feel going pay as you feel is a risk, we see it as an amazing opportunity become more connected in a world that is largely controlled by money and emotions of greed, scarcity and fear.  The drive behind the business had never been profit but rather serving the community and helping our environment.  This is just the next step in growing that desire and hopefully starting a much-needed conversation about money and our emotions surrounding it. </p>
<p>When we decided this was a change we wanted to make, we trailed our new Pay As You Feel business model at two festivals at the end of our 2019 season. This was a brilliant chance to gain much needed insight into how people interacted with the servers, how they decided on their donation amount and how we could do our best to make the experience easy and clear.  We focus a lot on the principles of economy and function in all aspects of our business. Especially relating to design of our menu, service processes and customer experience.  From what we have researched and our event trials, we have developed the world’s first business donation “point of sale” software working with web application company Long Live King and Payment provider Square. And as we mentioned in the video this will be made available for people to use and customise. </p>
<p>Although the vegan food industry is booming, we are seeing trends of smaller vegan business’s having to close, as well as high failure rate in the restaurant industry as a whole. Some people might feel there is a risk to open a second larger store which could cannibalise our existing successful store.  Again, this is something we have given careful consideration to and have never made being vegan our USP, we are more about healthy and delicious food served in a kind environment with responsible business methods.  We feel we have a strong and original position in the market and most importantly, food that everyone loves. The pay as you feel experiment will create a buzz and attract a lot of new customers and we are confident that by getting more people to just try our food our customer base will easily expand and support both of our stores.  </p>
<p>We’ve worked hard to get everything in place to really highlight what we are hoping to achieve. We are also aware that if for whatever reason the experiment doesn’t work, we may have to revert to charging set prices to ensure we can continue providing ethical jobs and doing great work. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP </strong></p>
<p>The beauty of our Pay As You Feel model is that even if you can’t offer monetary contribution, you can still be a part of our movement. We would really appreciate it if you could share our campaign, by the spreading the word, we can make sure that those who could benefit most hear about what we’re doing.  You get in touch if you think you have some skills we could use. </p>
<p>We really appreciate your time reading and following our progress, we hope to see you in our new restaurant or in a festival field for some sushi and a chat.</p>

As a team we believe passionately in what we are doing.  We want to protect and regenerate the environment and its wildlife whilst creating a kind and non-judgemental space where everyone can connect around a table, eating deliciously colourful fast food.  Most importantly we want to inspire people to drop their guards and open their hearts to the idea of giving gifts to benefit others.  We hope to prove that when you do business with these motives and desires that it is successful, even if we aren’t yet able to define exactly what this “success” might look like. 
 
THE RISKS AND CHALLENGES 
Some people feel going pay as you feel is a risk, we see it as an amazing opportunity become more connected in a world that is largely controlled by money and emotions of greed, scarcity and fear.  The drive behind the business had never been profit but rather serving the community and helping our environment.  This is just the next step in growing that desire and hopefully starting a much-needed conversation about money and our emotions surrounding it. 
When we decided this was a change we wanted to make, we trailed our new Pay As You Feel business model at two festivals at the end of our 2019 season. This was a brilliant chance to gain much needed insight into how people interacted with the servers, how they decided on their donation amount and how we could do our best to make the experience easy and clear.  We focus a lot on the principles of economy and function in all aspects of our business. Especially relating to design of our menu, service processes and customer experience.  From what we have researched and our event trials, we have developed the world’s first business donation “point of sale” software working with web application company Long Live King and Payment provider Square. And as we mentioned in the video this will be made available for people to use and customise. 
Although the vegan food industry is booming, we are seeing trends of smaller vegan business’s having to close, as well as high failure rate in the restaurant industry as a whole. Some people might feel there is a risk to open a second larger store which could cannibalise our existing successful store.  Again, this is something we have given careful consideration to and have never made being vegan our USP, we are more about healthy and delicious food served in a kind environment with responsible business methods.  We feel we have a strong and original position in the market and most importantly, food that everyone loves. The pay as you feel experiment will create a buzz and attract a lot of new customers and we are confident that by getting more people to just try our food our customer base will easily expand and support both of our stores.  
We’ve worked hard to get everything in place to really highlight what we are hoping to achieve. We are also aware that if for whatever reason the experiment doesn’t work, we may have to revert to charging set prices to ensure we can continue providing ethical jobs and doing great work.
