The Project
Mis Amigos Del Mar
A bilingual children's book emphasizing sea turtle conservation.

Children's books have the ability to educate not only children on conservation issues but also their families.  Students come home and share what they've learned, or ask for help with reading books which gets their parents and older siblings involved.  What one student learns, an entire family can learn.  Proficiency in English is a highly valued skill on the island and recognized as an opportunity for economic success; the bilingual aspect of the book will draw interest to many looking to learn English.

<p>Ukrainian permaculture is relatively young movement - the
  first certification course was organized in 2011. Since then we have created
  the NGO “Permaculture in Ukraine” and now the first sprouts of Ukrainian
  school of permaculture arises. Our country and our organization are now
  facing the war on the East of Ukraine, but we believe that by spreading the
  words of permaculture as the holistic wisdom of sustainable harmonic
  existence with nature and other people we can bring peace and prosperity to
  our country.</p>

    peacebuilding in post-conflict areas through permaculture workshops that
    empower marginalized and displaced communities to co-develop long-term food

    on permaculture principles. We have been able to run the first course

<p>However the graduates of our educational courses need
  further guidance when applying permaculture into their life. <a href=""http://www.learnpermaculture.com/index.php/publications-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Permaculture Design by Aranya</b></a>, published in 2012,
  is a 190-page handbook that guides the reader through the entire permaculture
  design process. Currently, no permaculture books are available in
  Ukrainian.  Having this book translated and published into
  Ukrainian would be a treasure in a country where English literacy,
  unfortunately, is an attribute to youngsters from big cities. Useful
  materials on Permaculture therefore remains unavailable for the majority of
  Ukrainian permaculturists - those ones, who want to change this world for better.</p>
<p>In 2014 we bought the right to translate and publish
  Permaculture Design by Aranya.  We aim to make this translation
  affordable for the majority of Ukrainians by running this project as a
  nonprofit venture. Unfortunately our country is now suffering not only from
  war, but also from terrible inflation as the result. The prices have risen
  while the population has become poorer, therefore we can not rise the book
  price. Moreover, we want to distribute this book for free within our
  Permaculture for Peace program to participants from the regions affected by
  the war.</p>
<p>We need to gather 1975 $ to pay for translation, editing and makeup, 643 $ for copyright and 318 $ to cover money processing fees and commissions. Once we get this sum (2800 $, which is sufficient to prepare an electronic book), our next goal will be to gather 2280 $ to publish the hard copy of this book - 465 $ of publication cost will be collected by pre-orders (estimated book price in Ukraine - 4,65 $). Now we are on the half way with book preparation and ready to publish it in September - October 2015.</p>
<p>Let’s become the part of <b>Earthcare, Peoplecare</b> and <b>Fairshare</b> permaculture
  challenge and show, that we can change this world together! Remember, that
  small donations also matter! Please, share this campaign with your friends!</p>

Ukrainian Permaculture Book!

















Ukrainian permaculturists work for resilience, and
      hold a hopeful vision for the future even in the face of ecological
      disasters, economic strife, and war.  Permaculture (permanent
      culture + permanent agriculture) is a problem-solving approach focused on
      finding win-win solutions by designing of our land and social systems
      based on sustainability principles found in natural systems.
Please help the NGO Permaculture in Ukraine and
      Permaculture for Peace translate the first-ever Permaculture Design
      Handbook into the Ukrainian language!























Ukrainian permaculture is relatively young movement - the
  first certification course was organized in 2011. Since then we have created
  the NGO “Permaculture in Ukraine” and now the first sprouts of Ukrainian
  school of permaculture arises. Our country and our organization are now
  facing the war on the East of Ukraine, but we believe that by spreading the
  words of permaculture as the holistic wisdom of sustainable harmonic
  existence with nature and other people we can bring peace and prosperity to
  our country.











In 2014 we launched the international project Permaculture for Peace to facilitate
    peacebuilding in post-conflict areas through permaculture workshops that
    empower marginalized and displaced communities to co-develop long-term food
    security, energy efficiency, and participatory democratic structures based
    on permaculture principles. We have been able to run the first course
    within this project that was free for internally displaced persons without
    being supported by big donors but due to contribution from many of friends
    who wish to share their knowledge and experience on the voluntary
    base. 








However the graduates of our educational courses need
  further guidance when applying permaculture into their life. Permaculture Design by Aranya, published in 2012,
  is a 190-page handbook that guides the reader through the entire permaculture
  design process. Currently, no permaculture books are available in
  Ukrainian.  Having this book translated and published into
  Ukrainian would be a treasure in a country where English literacy,
  unfortunately, is an attribute to youngsters from big cities. Useful
  materials on Permaculture therefore remains unavailable for the majority of
  Ukrainian permaculturists - those ones, who want to change this world for better.
In 2014 we bought the right to translate and publish
  Permaculture Design by Aranya.  We aim to make this translation
  affordable for the majority of Ukrainians by running this project as a
  nonprofit venture. Unfortunately our country is now suffering not only from
  war, but also from terrible inflation as the result. The prices have risen
  while the population has become poorer, therefore we can not rise the book
  price. Moreover, we want to distribute this book for free within our
  Permaculture for Peace program to participants from the regions affected by
  the war.
We need to gather 1975 $ to pay for translation, editing and makeup, 643 $ for copyright and 318 $ to cover money processing fees and commissions. Once we get this sum (2800 $, which is sufficient to prepare an electronic book), our next goal will be to gather 2280 $ to publish the hard copy of this book - 465 $ of publication cost will be collected by pre-orders (estimated book price in Ukraine - 4,65 $). Now we are on the half way with book preparation and ready to publish it in September - October 2015.
Let’s become the part of Earthcare, Peoplecare and Fairshare permaculture
  challenge and show, that we can change this world together! Remember, that
  small donations also matter! Please, share this campaign with your friends!




We have several gifts to raffle among our supporters! 




If your card payment
  does not proceed you may need to contact your bank or change your card limits
  for the internet transactions via your internet banking. Please, see also the
  also the other ways of sending donations.











  Thank you for your
    support!

<p>  Hi there Facebook
friends and family! I am here today to let you guys in on my idea for the
future of harnessing wind technology. </p>
<p>I have always had a love for Earth
science. As early as the fifth grade I started noticing certain things such as
how air gets compressed. In high school I had an epiphany after I learned that
the definition of energy is the ability to do work. After that, I started
thinking about what was the source of the energy for the things I saw in
motion. Soon after I started investigating wind turbines, my first question was
“why aren’t these things everywhere?” I found out that a traditional turbine
has to be put in high wind areas due to the sheer size of them. Instead of
thinking big, I started to think small. I have come up with a wind turbine
that, although large in size, is made up of small things. I believe that this
new turbine will not only be more efficient than current technology, but can
also be used in low wind areas. </p>
<p>Now, before I can let everyone in
on the details, I need some help. On December 3<sup>rd</sup> I’m meeting with
two professors at Purdue University, one of which holds a high ranking position
with The Richard G. Lugar Center for Renewable Energy. I am starting a
crowdfunding campaign so that I can raise money to keep moving forward with my
idea. I need the money to get patents, do research, and so on. I think it’s
important to say that renewable energy is not a left idea, nor a right idea, but
is actually a responsibility of every single one of us. I
truly, completely believe in what I am doing here. With my ideas, and your
backing, we can do some really terrific things. Please help me out by visiting
my Indiegogo page, and chipping in 5 or $10. If you can’t donate, just ‘like’
and ‘share’ this post to help me out. Thank you to everyone that helps me out.
I truly appreciate you! Signing off, Doug Robinson. </p>

Those include various species of monkeys, birds, lizards and many others almost extinct animals. Most impressive of all are huge orangutans having durian lunch at the treetop in my backyard. Behind the house there is a cave, another spot where animals gather, which has the shape of the ship. My place is named after it, batu in Indonesian language means rock and kapal means ship. Through Eco House Batu Kapal project I wish to preserve the originality of the nature which nowadays is being endangered in our fast changing world.</span></p><p> </p><p><strong style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Primary Goal </strong></p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">My land extends on 6 Ha.
On one small part the house is situated and the rest is home for the jungle
animals, flora and fauna. My big house consists only of walls and roof. There
is still a lot construction work needed to be done. My goal is to obtain origin
of habitation of the nature (animals and plants) and to build environmentally
sensitive house: no forest will be cut and no hillside will be razed. Beside
cement I am mostly I’m using materials which nature is offering, that are
mainly wood and rocks which I collect from the river that passes the house.
Until now I used my bare hands for work to be done. At this point I am turning
to the outer world to help me raise funds for buying equipment and materials to
finish the building of the house and other infrastructure.</span><br/></p>

responsible and environmentally respectful activities would be held. First of
all I want to contribute to environmental awareness of local people which seems
to love nature but lack the knowledge of how to treat it: they often come to
spent time around my cave, but leave a bunch of trashes. Another problem are
the motorbikes that pass by my land, they scare the
orangutans and other animals, which drives them away from their original
habitat. Moreover they drop sewages into the river which is becoming more and
more polluted. Educational workshops and gatherings would be held for this
reason. Because I know education is the first and most important step toward
awareness I would offer my place as outdoor classroom to students of different
age (primary school, high school and university) and as a spot meetings for the
volunteers and local people.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Furthermore I
will make a garden where I will grow plants for herbal medicine which could be
part of the outdoor lessons for students. Through mentioned activities I will
establish ecosensitive habitat, where people and animals can live in symbiosis.
I will devote more attention to orangutans and other animals which are making
their home there. The animals are being endangered with the palm oil
plantations and that is why I want to up keep the planting of the trees, which
are home habitat and a food providing of their daily menu.</span><br/></p>

There is my house situated close to Gunung Leuser National park (Bukit Lawang). In the middle of  unique ecosystem I live surrounded by jungle creatures. Those include various species of monkeys, birds, lizards and many others almost extinct animals. Most impressive of all are huge orangutans having durian lunch at the treetop in my backyard. Behind the house there is a cave, another spot where animals gather, which has the shape of the ship. My place is named after it, batu in Indonesian language means rock and kapal means ship. Through Eco House Batu Kapal project I wish to preserve the originality of the nature which nowadays is being endangered in our fast changing world. Primary Goal My land extends on 6 Ha.
On one small part the house is situated and the rest is home for the jungle
animals, flora and fauna. My big house consists only of walls and roof. There
is still a lot construction work needed to be done. My goal is to obtain origin
of habitation of the nature (animals and plants) and to build environmentally
sensitive house: no forest will be cut and no hillside will be razed. Beside
cement I am mostly I’m using materials which nature is offering, that are
mainly wood and rocks which I collect from the river that passes the house.
Until now I used my bare hands for work to be done. At this point I am turning
to the outer world to help me raise funds for buying equipment and materials to
finish the building of the house and other infrastructure.
Approximately expense
for the house:  3000 $ 
Materials and equipment
needed:- Drill ,
battery based (there is no electricity there)- Saw,
battery based  - Solar
power lamps  - Cement  - Toilet
and shower- Kitchen
equipment  ( at the time of rainy season,
we can cook indoor and not only in outdoor open fire)- Nails,
bamboo, rope, shovel…- Donations
for the workers Approximant time of the primary
goal completed:   4
months
Long-term goal
I wish my house to become a place where socially
responsible and environmentally respectful activities would be held. First of
all I want to contribute to environmental awareness of local people which seems
to love nature but lack the knowledge of how to treat it: they often come to
spent time around my cave, but leave a bunch of trashes. Another problem are
the motorbikes that pass by my land, they scare the
orangutans and other animals, which drives them away from their original
habitat. Moreover they drop sewages into the river which is becoming more and
more polluted. Educational workshops and gatherings would be held for this
reason. Because I know education is the first and most important step toward
awareness I would offer my place as outdoor classroom to students of different
age (primary school, high school and university) and as a spot meetings for the
volunteers and local people.
Furthermore I
will make a garden where I will grow plants for herbal medicine which could be
part of the outdoor lessons for students. Through mentioned activities I will
establish ecosensitive habitat, where people and animals can live in symbiosis.
I will devote more attention to orangutans and other animals which are making
their home there. The animals are being endangered with the palm oil
plantations and that is why I want to up keep the planting of the trees, which
are home habitat and a food providing of their daily menu.
After all I
want my place to be art space where people can make nature friendly arts, such
as wood carving and batik making, i.e. waxing and colouring textile, using
natural colours.Approximately expense for the long-term goal:  7000 $- Planting
trees and up keeping the surroundings  (Meranti
tree (orangutans home and food); Jack fruit; Durian; Bean fruit; Passion fruit;
Guava;  Banana;…- The
herbal plantation - planting different
types of healing herbs like ginger, lemon-grass, turmeric,…and up keeping it.- Garden Infrastructure (buying
the materials and vegetables for planting)- Materials for the irrigation
(which is connected to the river) (cement,…)- Materials for building the
entry point (wood, nails, rope, cement, shovel…)- Up keeping the cave (putting
the signs- “No litter”, Trash canes,…)- Materials for building the
outdoor classrooms (wood, nails, rope, cement,…)- Equipment for outdoor
classrooms  (benches and chairs from
wood, board, markers, books about animals, flora and fauna, projector,
computer, speakers,…everything would be generated with the solar power energy)- Infrastructure for the camping
area (covered spaces- tents, roof, bamboo huts, beds, toilets, showers, solar
power lamps, cooking area-open space, fire ground camp, but in the rainy season
the indoor  kitchen facilities would be
used, ...)- Realizing the workshops for
local people (space for workshops, equipment, materials,…)- Solar power lampsApproximant time of the long-term
goal completed:     Ongoing process

</h3>In a small experimental city in south India called <a href=""http://www.auroville.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Auroville</a>, we live by the aspiration to create Human Unity and Peace.  It is the Soul of all our work and life.  In <a href=""http://www.auroville-botanical-gardens.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Auroville's Botanical Gardens</a>, we attempt to inspire and create this Peace and Unity by working with Nature to manifest Beauty through growing gardens together.  With members, local workers, and volunteers from around the world, the Botanical Gardens has not only created a space of Beauty and Peace, but also a space for educating children and adults about the diversity of Nature, especially the local indigenous plant species.  Every year, 3,000 students visit our education program and the Gardens, where they experience and learn about over 2,500 species of plants, including 250 species of trees.<br/><br/><h3>A Japanese Garden for Peace and Unity<br/>
</h3>We have designed a new Japanese Garden with a Pavilion of Silent Reflection to bring the Japanese quality of Beauty into our Botanical Garden space.  It will be a place where people will be able to feel inspired by the harmony of nature and Spirit that Japanese gardens are famous for, while also providing the opportunity for children and others in India to learn more about the diversity of the world's gardens.  Here are the designs developed by Jyoti, our Aurovilian landscape designer from Japan:<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445603667/yhsgdtqlfer6boltvugs.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>The new garden and its Pavilion will also be a place for traditional tea ceremonies and other contemplative social gatherings for the Auroville community.  <br/></p>
<p>Building Peace and Human Unity is a work that must be done through all variety of forms and ways, even in the building of a garden.  The creation of a garden can bring people together for new experiences, where relationships between people grow through a connection with each other and the Nature around.  We hope that much of the work of building this garden will be done by volunteers and the members of the community in order to create a different Spirit in the garden.  It will be a place for all to visit and enjoy once it is created.....So, we invite you to participate and help us manifest this Garden!</p>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Money!</b>  We need around $13,640 total for the Garden, which includes:  $6,820 for the materials and labor for building the tea house/pavilion; $3,850 for the leak-proof pond; and $2,970 for large boulders/stones, plants and planting, pathways and general land-shaping.</li>
<li>
<b>Volunteers!</b>  Yes, we would love to have you participate in physically building the garden when the time comes.  Check out the <a href=""http://www.auroville-botanical-gardens.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Botanical Gardens website</a> and see how you can volunteer!</li>
<li>
<b>Spread the word</b> and help us raise the funds needed!  Share this campaign on Facebook, Twitter, your blog or website, or any other social media you use...and if you wish to share our videos, please do so!  Remember to use the Indiegogo sharing tools!  <br/>

<ul>
</ul>
<p>All funds donated will go entirely to this project, even if we don't make the goal here....We have done preliminary work on the space for this garden and will keep working on manifesting it.  In time, we know it will be complete, as for us there is no real deadline for building this garden!  Our team has built and grown a 44 acre space over 15 years starting from nothing, with our leader Paul, a skilled landscape architect and horticulturalist, who started this place working the soil with his own two hands.  Whatever obstacles may come, financial or otherwise, Auroville is a place where perseverance is rewarded, even if it takes years to happen, though we hope YOU will help us finish much sooner!  When life slows down one can be sure it will eventually speed up again....and lead to new doorways and opportunities!</p>

In a small experimental city in south India called Auroville, we live by the aspiration to create Human Unity and Peace.  It is the Soul of all our work and life.  In Auroville's Botanical Gardens, we attempt to inspire and create this Peace and Unity by working with Nature to manifest Beauty through growing gardens together.  With members, local workers, and volunteers from around the world, the Botanical Gardens has not only created a space of Beauty and Peace, but also a space for educating children and adults about the diversity of Nature, especially the local indigenous plant species.  Every year, 3,000 students visit our education program and the Gardens, where they experience and learn about over 2,500 species of plants, including 250 species of trees.A Japanese Garden for Peace and Unity
We have designed a new Japanese Garden with a Pavilion of Silent Reflection to bring the Japanese quality of Beauty into our Botanical Garden space.  It will be a place where people will be able to feel inspired by the harmony of nature and Spirit that Japanese gardens are famous for, while also providing the opportunity for children and others in India to learn more about the diversity of the world's gardens.  Here are the designs developed by Jyoti, our Aurovilian landscape designer from Japan:


The new garden and its Pavilion will also be a place for traditional tea ceremonies and other contemplative social gatherings for the Auroville community.  
Building Peace and Human Unity is a work that must be done through all variety of forms and ways, even in the building of a garden.  The creation of a garden can bring people together for new experiences, where relationships between people grow through a connection with each other and the Nature around.  We hope that much of the work of building this garden will be done by volunteers and the members of the community in order to create a different Spirit in the garden.  It will be a place for all to visit and enjoy once it is created.....So, we invite you to participate and help us manifest this Garden!


  What We Need
 Auroville is essentially a city of volunteers, people who have chosen to live here and contribute to this adventure in building a city based not upon profit but upon a new Spirit and Intention - for Human Unity and Peace.  So, that means we need YOUR support to succeed in this Japanese Garden project, in the form of:


Money!  We need around $13,640 total for the Garden, which includes:  $6,820 for the materials and labor for building the tea house/pavilion; $3,850 for the leak-proof pond; and $2,970 for large boulders/stones, plants and planting, pathways and general land-shaping.

Volunteers!  Yes, we would love to have you participate in physically building the garden when the time comes.  Check out the Botanical Gardens website and see how you can volunteer!

Spread the word and help us raise the funds needed!  Share this campaign on Facebook, Twitter, your blog or website, or any other social media you use...and if you wish to share our videos, please do so!  Remember to use the Indiegogo sharing tools!  


Lots of Goodwill and Smiles!





All funds donated will go entirely to this project, even if we don't make the goal here....We have done preliminary work on the space for this garden and will keep working on manifesting it.  In time, we know it will be complete, as for us there is no real deadline for building this garden!  Our team has built and grown a 44 acre space over 15 years starting from nothing, with our leader Paul, a skilled landscape architect and horticulturalist, who started this place working the soil with his own two hands.  Whatever obstacles may come, financial or otherwise, Auroville is a place where perseverance is rewarded, even if it takes years to happen, though we hope YOU will help us finish much sooner!  When life slows down one can be sure it will eventually speed up again....and lead to new doorways and opportunities!
Please watch our pitch video and our general garden tour video under the Gallery section to see more about the project, as well as the gardens that have been created at the Auroville Botanical Gardens.  You can also see some of the other design work of Jyoti at http://oneasiaproject.org/?page_id=1453 
We thank you for visiting our project and hope you will choose to give us your support!",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div><b>The Problem</b></div> <p></p>
<p></p>
<b>Household Food Waste (HFW)</b> receives considerable
attention worldwide due to the environmental, economic and social impacts it
generates. HFW constitutes the largest production source among the different
food waste sectors (manufacturing, food service/catering and wholesale/retail),
while it also comprises the largest single waste fraction generated by households
(reaching up to 61% of municipal solid waste). Future trends show that HFW is anticipated to increase
significantly due to population growth and increasing consumption patterns, giving
rise to increased environmental impact in cases when unsustainable management
techniques are applied.<p>Research conducted in London proves the following: </p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>Food Waste, at household level, has a direct relationship with birth defects and reproductive disorders. </li>

The Problem 

Household Food Waste (HFW) receives considerable
attention worldwide due to the environmental, economic and social impacts it
generates. HFW constitutes the largest production source among the different
food waste sectors (manufacturing, food service/catering and wholesale/retail),
while it also comprises the largest single waste fraction generated by households
(reaching up to 61% of municipal solid waste). Future trends show that HFW is anticipated to increase
significantly due to population growth and increasing consumption patterns, giving
rise to increased environmental impact in cases when unsustainable management
techniques are applied.Research conducted in London proves the following: 


Food Waste, at household level, has a direct relationship with birth defects and reproductive disorders. 
 Increased frequency of Cancers in counties containing Food Waste sites was found in two US studies particularly for gastrointestinal, oesophageal, stomach, colon and rectal cancer.

A comprehensive review investigates health problems (that include respiratory symptoms, irritation of the skin, nose and eyes, gastrointestinal problems, fatigue, headaches, psychological problems and allergies) are caused from Food Waste produced at both, household and landfill sites. 
High levels of dioxin exposure found in workplaces (from Food Waste) and after accidents such as that at Seveso have caused chloracne and an increase in cardiovascular disease.

The organic compounds which have received the most attention relating to incineration are dioxins and PCBs, partly because of their ability to accumulate in the body. 


The Product 
EnviroDryer is a family-sized affordable Food Waste Composter. It converts any organic waste into high quality organic biomass fertilizer. Your kitchen leftovers can turn into 3 kg of organic fruit/vegetable per day. On the other hand, the biomass (whats left from the cycle) can be used as an alternative for fossil fuels to produce high calorific energy (up to 2500 cal).

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">It is a cool and pleasant summer evening. </span></p>
<p>You leave the bedroom windows open to enjoy some fresh air during your sleep.  A silent rain steals in.  And ruins your carpet. </p>
<p>In your frustration, you think, there has to be a good way to keep the rain out, but let the fresh air in. </p>
<p>And that was the genesis of the Dry Open Window, because that's exactly what happened to the inventor Zack.  <span style=""background-color: initial;"">It was the first step of a thousand-mile journey. </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Along the way, company executives, engineers schooled at MIT, Ohio State, Michigan, and Wisconsin, and many others came to help. Why?  Because they believe in the green idea.  The great SPARK of Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti MI granted us thousands of dollars to assist in patent application. </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The Dry Open Window acronym is DOW, and our team also take it to mean <b>Do One Wonder</b>.  We worked to make the impossible possible - let fresh air in but keep the rain out.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471489560/IMG_0216_m0cnht.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 208px;height: 156px;""/>   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471489698/IMG_0221_brtjpw.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 359.664px;height: 153px;""/><br/></span></p>
<p></p>
<p>This is a simple idea, but it's simply great.  In test after test, the Dry Open Window defied rainy weather with winds whipping up to 50 miles an hour.  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">It lets fresh air in, but keeps the rain out.  </span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">It lets you sleep in comfortable privacy in fresh air in the evening. </span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">It is easily adjustable to fit in almost any windows.</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">It has a twist lock that secures it in place. </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">It saves you energy by avoiding the use of an air conditioner because it lets cool fresh air in - rain or shine. </span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The Dry Open Window has a set of V-shaped louvers spaced from each other just so, allowing air to flow through, but stopping rain drops from coming in. The overlapping louvers also give you privacy because no one can peer through the overlapping louvers even as air flows in.</p>

<p>You then will have contributed to make the world just a little greener. </p>
<p>In return, you will receive a Dry Open Window - aesthetically pleasing, super functional, a breeze to assemble, and easy to use.  </p>

<p>It almost assembles itself - <b><u>no tools are needed</u></b>.  Our smart design also makes it impossible to assemble it wrong.  We poke-yoked it, as the engineers would call it.  Seriously, look it up! </p>
<p>And because of the smart design, you will find it super easy to use.  It fits in almost any single-hung or double-hung window (the kind that slides open up and down), snuggling into window widths from 20 inches to 38 inches. </p>
<p>And we have a twist lock rod for you to lock the device up so it cannot be removed from the outside.  The intuitive twist lock takes no effort to use. </p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">According to the EPA, our indoor environment is more than five times more toxic than our outdoor environment.  Sometimes the air measurements indoors have been found to be 100 times more polluted.</span></p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Furthermore, a household on average spends over $500 a year on air conditioning. Your payback on this little investment is almost instantaneous. You should not hesitate for a second to pick up a perk. </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">On top of that, you reduce your carbon footprint by reducing the use of electricity. That is more important than savings on your electric bill.  This is lending a helping hand to green Mother Earth.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">When we plant a tree for you and the world, the trees will give off fresh air.  Why fresh air?</span></p>

<li>
<i style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Fresh
air saves lives</b></i><span style=""background-color: initial;""> - trees use
photosynthesis to turn carbon dioxide into the oxygen we need to breathe; trees
remove pollution from the air, making it healthier for us to take into our
lungs.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><i><b>It can boost your immune system</b></i> - walking amongst trees will give
you exercise and feed you fresh air, leading
to an increase in natural killer cells, neutrophils and monocytes, which
ultimately increases immune function.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><b><i>The smells in fresh air bust stress and increase happiness</i></b> - smell of roses promotes relaxation; lavender and jasmine
lower anxiety and up your mood; scent of pine trees decreases stress and
increases relaxation; a whiff of freshly cut grass can help you feel calmer and happier. </span><br/>

<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><b><i>Fresh

<b style=""font-style: italic;"">Do One Wonder - </b>DOW <b style=""font-style: italic;"">- Dry Open Window</b>
</div>
</div></div>","It is a cool and pleasant summer evening. 
You leave the bedroom windows open to enjoy some fresh air during your sleep.  A silent rain steals in.  And ruins your carpet. 
In your frustration, you think, there has to be a good way to keep the rain out, but let the fresh air in. 
And that was the genesis of the Dry Open Window, because that's exactly what happened to the inventor Zack.  It was the first step of a thousand-mile journey. 
Along the way, company executives, engineers schooled at MIT, Ohio State, Michigan, and Wisconsin, and many others came to help. Why?  Because they believe in the green idea.  The great SPARK of Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti MI granted us thousands of dollars to assist in patent application. 
The Dry Open Window acronym is DOW, and our team also take it to mean Do One Wonder.  We worked to make the impossible possible - let fresh air in but keep the rain out.  
   

This is a simple idea, but it's simply great.  In test after test, the Dry Open Window defied rainy weather with winds whipping up to 50 miles an hour.  


It lets fresh air in, but keeps the rain out.  

It lets you sleep in comfortable privacy in fresh air in the evening. 
It is easily adjustable to fit in almost any windows.

It has a twist lock that secures it in place. 


It saves you energy by avoiding the use of an air conditioner because it lets cool fresh air in - rain or shine. 



The Dry Open Window has a set of V-shaped louvers spaced from each other just so, allowing air to flow through, but stopping rain drops from coming in. The overlapping louvers also give you privacy because no one can peer through the overlapping louvers even as air flows in.

      
Its design has been aided and tested in a wind tunnel by engineers trained at MIT, Ohio State, Michigan, and Wisconsin.  Dennis Nash, an MIT grad, is eager to talk about the Dry Open Window below:
Under the watchful eyes of well trained engineers, we have tested it in real rainy weather.  We can honestly tell you, it works! See the Dry Open Window in Action:

For every Dry Open Window we send out to the world, we plant a tree for you and the world.  We do this in the spirit of Do One Wonder. It may be a small wonder, but a wonder it still is.  And we hope the small wonders will gather force like a forest, blossoming into a bigger wonder of millions of trees. And it all starts with your tree, a small wonder.  
We work with the world-renowned Arbor Day Foundation to make it happen. We have, in fact, already planted a multitude of trees in the Choccolocco State Forest in Alabama through the sales of the Dry Open Window, as evidenced in the link and pictures below, where trees are being planted.  
  




We are proud to be a part of the Arbor Day Choccolocco State Forest tree-planting project, which has huge impacts on the environment, as shown below.

        
https://www.arborday.org/programs/replanting/action/forests/2016/choccolocco-state-forest.pdf
Our goal is simple: reduce our carbon footprint at both ends: 



By using the Dry Open Window, you use less energy while enjoying fresh air.


By planting more trees, you improve the fresh air we breathe in. 


We think this is a win-win strategy that works marvelously.  We simply make it possible for you to Do One Wonder - you grow a tree for the world while you enjoy fresh air, use less energy, and save money.



It is the peace of mind we aim for: sleep in fresh air comfort and secured privacy, and do something to green our beloved earth and refresh our precious air.  We like to think you will love this state of mind and take part in our movement. We have done our part, so would you help by doing your part, for yourself and Mother Earth? 
Please pick one of the perks, help us to save our planet, and enjoy some fresh air and your privacy at the same time.







What You Get and What We Do for You and the World

To plant a tree for the world and secure your Dry Open Window,  the perk is yours at a mere $49 (a 30% discount of our retail price). 
You then will have contributed to make the world just a little greener. 
In return, you will receive a Dry Open Window - aesthetically pleasing, super functional, a breeze to assemble, and easy to use.  

  
It almost assembles itself - no tools are needed.  Our smart design also makes it impossible to assemble it wrong.  We poke-yoked it, as the engineers would call it.  Seriously, look it up! 
And because of the smart design, you will find it super easy to use.  It fits in almost any single-hung or double-hung window (the kind that slides open up and down), snuggling into window widths from 20 inches to 38 inches. 
And we have a twist lock rod for you to lock the device up so it cannot be removed from the outside.  The intuitive twist lock takes no effort to use. 


    
For our part, when you get your perk, the earth gets its own perk because of you - we will plant a tree.  And we will let the world know that you planted a tree by recording it in our permanent registry of the Dry Open Window Forest Builders.  
Click here to see the growing list of Forest Builders in the Dry Open Window Forest Builders permanent registry
You can share just a first name or your whole life history at the registry.  We want you to be proud, because you should be.  You can always wander on back to see your name there, show it off to your friends, and point it out to your children. And the earth and its inhabitants will be grateful. 
Your contribution, along with contributions from others, will let a tree take root, extend its leaves, absorb carbon dioxide, clean up the air, and rejuvenate the world with fresh oxygen.  
Your funds will be sent to the Arbor Day Foundation, the tree experts, as they plant the trees for us and the world in forests all over the nation.  We will showcase their work at our permanent Dry Open Window Forest Builders registry whenever progress is made, so you can see pictures of the trees planted, the forests established, and the landscape rejuvenated. While the registry is not maintained by the Arbor Day Foundation, but by the Dry Open Window website, we keep in constant touch with the Arbor Day Foundation and will make every effort to keep you abreast of all the wonderful things the Arbor Day Foundation does.

The Impact 
So, how does your action impact you and the world? Your action will Do One Wonder for yourself and the world. 
Let's first start with you and your health.  Fresh air means better health for you.  Did you know that indoor air is many times worse than the air outside?
According to the EPA, our indoor environment is more than five times more toxic than our outdoor environment.  Sometimes the air measurements indoors have been found to be 100 times more polluted.

 

Why wouldn't you want fresh air streaming inside your room or house?  Would you rather breathe in the heavily polluted air all day and all night? The Dry Open Window comes to your rescue, even when it is raining cats and dogs outside. 
Furthermore, a household on average spends over $500 a year on air conditioning. Your payback on this little investment is almost instantaneous. You should not hesitate for a second to pick up a perk. 
On top of that, you reduce your carbon footprint by reducing the use of electricity. That is more important than savings on your electric bill.  This is lending a helping hand to green Mother Earth.
When we plant a tree for you and the world, the trees will give off fresh air.  Why fresh air?




Fresh
air saves lives - trees use
photosynthesis to turn carbon dioxide into the oxygen we need to breathe; trees
remove pollution from the air, making it healthier for us to take into our
lungs.


It can boost your immune system - walking amongst trees will give
you exercise and feed you fresh air, leading
to an increase in natural killer cells, neutrophils and monocytes, which
ultimately increases immune function.


The smells in fresh air bust stress and increase happiness - smell of roses promotes relaxation; lavender and jasmine
lower anxiety and up your mood; scent of pine trees decreases stress and
increases relaxation; a whiff of freshly cut grass can help you feel calmer and happier. 


Fresh
oxygen energizes - spending time in
fresh air, surrounded by nature, increases energy in 90% of people.


Easy Assembly
You might be intimidated by assembly.  But don't you sweat it.  



First, no tools are required. 

Second, a child can put it together.
Third, no instructions are really needed.  We have included instructions, but you will see instructions are barely needed

Here is a fun video of our MIT and Michigan engineers trying to assemble our first production Dry Open Window without instructions.  Our users have told us that the assembly is a breeze. 


OK, here is the real assembly instructions video:

Other Ways You Can Help
If you say, I'd rather have a wet and soggy carpet in rainy weather, we say, okay, fine, good luck. But, just in case, if you smartly opt to improve the air we breathe in and to green the earth with us, here is your opportunity to help by picking up this perk: if you donate $5, we guarantee you that we will plant a tree for you.  And your name will be registered in the same permanent Dry Open Window Forest Builders registry.  
And you can still show it off to your friends, children, colleagues, or even strangers who will then become your friends. The earth will be just as grateful. Your tree will be just as green.  The air is just a little fresher.  And the earth just a little greener.
You are then a friend of the earth.  Live on and enjoy!

Share with Others
Every time you share this campaign with a friend, you help to seed this movement. Thank you SO much for sharing it with your community:

Please share it on your Facebook - show a picture of it in your window in rainy weather; brag about how it brings in fresh air; or even do a little video to tout how miraculously it stops the rain from coming in but welcomes in the fresh air. 
We hope you can email the wonders of this little device to 5 friends - tell them if they use it, they will love it, and how they can help to green the earth.
Tweet about it - it is always a good thing to use a Dry Open Window and have a tree planted for the world. 



Weather Caution


Warning!  In severe thunderstorms or hurricanes, when winds threaten to pick up your house and the rain comes down in sheets, we ask you to take the Dry Open Window out of the window and close the window for your safety.

<p>Sea level is rising
and it is not going to stop!  To island and developing nations this is a threat to unique cultures,
families, ways of life, and the future economic systems of a people’s basic
sustainability/survivability.  </p>
<p>Yet, there are
important things we can do right now to help. 
As we mapped Mars for water and minerals, we do the same ‘<i>one-nation-at-a-time’</i> here on earth for

<p>The people who live on small islands
(and any nation with a coastline) need your/our help to establish both a

smash “Digital-Poverty.” </p>
<p>Now lets add-in a majority of our planet’s

<p>·<span>  </span>We want two island nations to be (scientifically

<p><u>This
is </u><u>DIGITIZE-A-NATION<sup>TM</sup></u></p>
<p><b>The Technical Overview of Digitize-a-Nation:</b></p>
<p>Every nation is <i>a <b>system-of-systems</b></i><b>,</b> from the
infrastructure networks that provide food, power, water and information, to the
commodity networks of farms and mineral resources. Mapping as if each nation is its own planet, these elements can all be <u>meshed into a single national economic system</u> that
provides both balance and a plan for its people’s sustainable development.  Digitize-a-Nation is this first network
vivisection that provides <b><i><span>‘information as infrastructure’</span></i></b> to national policy
makers to best determine Environmentally Sustainable Growth (ESG) via sustainable investing and effective risk
management. </p>
<p><b>The Non-Technical Overview of Digitize-a-Nation:</b></p>
<p>We rocket scientists
can map a small country as its own planet, give the data to its people, and let
them build their future with new tools, and let the people who live there create the nation they think best
for their needs and dreams.  </p>
<p><b>Ok, So What’s the problem? 
</b></p>
<p>In most small
and developing nations, policy leaders make decisions using incomplete or
outdated national data.  The lack of a
sovereign data network let big nations and multinational corporations negotiate
with <i>‘Data Superiority’ </i>over a small nation’s economic future.  This is unfair, and can lead to national
bullying of small and developing nations by others. It is their nation, it should be their data.</p>
<p><b>Ok, So what might a solution be?  </b></p>
<p>In order for the local island people
to manage where sea-level rise is changing the physical and economic
environment, the government and the indigenous communities need their own interactive
networked sovereign planetary database meshed with Wall Street economics to
build their sustainable future. Leaders
need National Data Sovereignty. </p>
<p>The network is designed to empower: </p>
<p>·<span>

<p>The success of this project not only
empowers the lives of people and sustainability topics yet also prove the
viability of local data networks. </p>
<p><b>Their Value Proposition</b></p>
<p>Every day small/developing nations
pay hidden risk fees to currency and commodity markets, that better data would
eliminate and reverse inflationary costs of risk across each nation, and better
engage its population into digital systems, micro-economics and new
markets.  A Digitized nation’s GDP should
increase 3% the first year, recovering the cost of the Digitize program.  In 3-years, a Digitized nation should see
+10% in GDP, plus data as a commodity, should become its own income
generator.  A public/private-partnership
should also stimulate new information networked to business, education, and
training.</p>
<p><b>Why do we list as Entrepreneur not Community?</b></p>
<p>Working towards a
‘Franchise’ type model, we want the people of a Digitized nation to make money
and build new businesses from their own data set; and encourage each nation
build a ‘public-private-partnership’ between its sovereign leadership, its
academic, and business community.  Let
them be the Entrepreneurs with this data.</p>
<p><b>ABOUT US</b></p>
<p>Digitize-a-Nation is an LLC based in
Washington DC founded and directed by Andrew Cameron and William Brammer both
who really like planet earth and all the people here.  Planet earth has more roller-coasters than
all the other planets combined.  We need
to take the space tools we have and make them work for everyone on the planet,
especially those in small and developing nations.  </p>
<p>At Digitize-a-Nation we are using the
most advanced SuperComputers to develop a new approach that network satellite
data with Wall Street to benefit those on this planet who need help the
most.  Fighting Poverty and cultivating
long-term sustainable practices begins with empowering the communities living
there actually begin with data. Its how we map planets, its how we help
our own.</p>
<p>We have
collaboration with the Space Agencies, top science, top explorers and
oceanographers, top supercomputer people, top economists, and of course a bunch
of very fun rocket scientists.  We are
serious about what we can do!!</p>
<p><b>Ok, What We Need from You</b></p>
<p>We need to get a
science plane in the air and collect planetary data and put it into a
SuperComputer.  Simple, however airplanes
and supercomputers cost money.  The first
step will cost $440,000 and help us get the World Bank and Wall Street to cover
the rest.  However, the value return for
the island nation can be in the tens of millions over time, reducing risk with better data, better their lives,
and better their interaction with New Environmentally Sustainable Investing.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435852486/umxhknxoctepj9k7ibsi.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435852524/qs75crstfftjtzrzj4sx.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435852582/ppunmwmghdlbcdsjn7fu.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435852599/nboh1vnq1pzewxm1xfxw.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435852633/j08xltgxc5zhcftwsanr.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435852657/agp7as2abkxmdee29uo6.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435852683/rixtkcdluikk6uh45mfs.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435852693/jja9dqskvev9dhovww5f.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

</p><p><span>To fulfill our 2015 promises to the
island nations and keep their data program protected, we need to charter a
specialized sensor aircraft, collect that data, buy supercomputer time and
create a new data model and connect to a network.  Your donation will go directly to chartering
the satellite simulator aircraft and data infrastructure that allows us to put
Planetary data into a SuperComputer ‘point cloud’ and made available for the
needs of the people, the needs of the nation, and become a new model for the
planet.  </span></p>
<p>Once you the visionary supporters,
the people of the islands, the rocket scientists, and we at Digitize-a-Nation
have this first mission accomplished, Wall Street will understand economics
work better with Planetary data from the nation itself, and then World Bank
among other international institutions should begin to fund the needs for more
island nations, more developing nations, and ultimately all nation’s water and

The success of this project not only
empowers the lives of people and sustainability topics yet also prove the
viability of local data networks. 
Their Value Proposition
Every day small/developing nations
pay hidden risk fees to currency and commodity markets, that better data would
eliminate and reverse inflationary costs of risk across each nation, and better
engage its population into digital systems, micro-economics and new
markets.  A Digitized nation’s GDP should
increase 3% the first year, recovering the cost of the Digitize program.  In 3-years, a Digitized nation should see
+10% in GDP, plus data as a commodity, should become its own income
generator.  A public/private-partnership
should also stimulate new information networked to business, education, and
training.
Why do we list as Entrepreneur not Community?
Working towards a
‘Franchise’ type model, we want the people of a Digitized nation to make money
and build new businesses from their own data set; and encourage each nation
build a ‘public-private-partnership’ between its sovereign leadership, its
academic, and business community.  Let
them be the Entrepreneurs with this data.
ABOUT US
Digitize-a-Nation is an LLC based in
Washington DC founded and directed by Andrew Cameron and William Brammer both
who really like planet earth and all the people here.  Planet earth has more roller-coasters than
all the other planets combined.  We need
to take the space tools we have and make them work for everyone on the planet,
especially those in small and developing nations.  
At Digitize-a-Nation we are using the
most advanced SuperComputers to develop a new approach that network satellite
data with Wall Street to benefit those on this planet who need help the
most.  Fighting Poverty and cultivating
long-term sustainable practices begins with empowering the communities living
there actually begin with data. Its how we map planets, its how we help
our own.
We have
collaboration with the Space Agencies, top science, top explorers and
oceanographers, top supercomputer people, top economists, and of course a bunch
of very fun rocket scientists.  We are
serious about what we can do!!
Ok, What We Need from You
We need to get a
science plane in the air and collect planetary data and put it into a
SuperComputer.  Simple, however airplanes
and supercomputers cost money.  The first
step will cost $440,000 and help us get the World Bank and Wall Street to cover
the rest.  However, the value return for
the island nation can be in the tens of millions over time, reducing risk with better data, better their lives,
and better their interaction with New Environmentally Sustainable Investing.






To fulfill our 2015 promises to the
island nations and keep their data program protected, we need to charter a
specialized sensor aircraft, collect that data, buy supercomputer time and
create a new data model and connect to a network.  Your donation will go directly to chartering
the satellite simulator aircraft and data infrastructure that allows us to put
Planetary data into a SuperComputer ‘point cloud’ and made available for the
needs of the people, the needs of the nation, and become a new model for the
planet.  
Once you the visionary supporters,
the people of the islands, the rocket scientists, and we at Digitize-a-Nation
have this first mission accomplished, Wall Street will understand economics
work better with Planetary data from the nation itself, and then World Bank
among other international institutions should begin to fund the needs for more
island nations, more developing nations, and ultimately all nation’s water and
a sustainable economic future.  
But this can only happen with your
help!
2015 Minimum budget

You can help in two ways:
1. Please
Donate Here Today! Help us fund this big and challenging, sustainable
project.  (If you were/are a Scout feel
free to include your troop/den number, or if a student, include your
teacher/school name)
2.
Spread the word!Tell your friends about this
opportunity. Please call a friend, share our campaign link on Facebook and
other social media.

Only
by working together can we better the only planet we have, 
one-nation-at-a-time.
From
all of us at Digitize-a-Nation
Thank
You
for
making a difference!
and
Thank
You
to
our
space/science/technology/economic
collaborators
and supporting organizations!
The Perks: Now  
A Monument to Vision.  No T-shirts, as all money goes to rent the
airplane and supercomputer time to crunch numbers, and build the first Digitize
model.  Every contributing visionary will
get their names etched into a monument to be placed on the island built by
local artists.  There will also be an “on-line”
monument, which our designers say will be very very cool.  


The Perks: Later  

Though Not Right Away,
if we can get this started, maybe 6 months after the first flight and first
data, our team likes the idea of having a Big Virtual Party to connect the
first visionaries and all the people on the islands in a one hour monster chat
room to say hello to everyone.  Lets use
the supercomputers and make a world of friends!!  Lets let other people far away from us that
we care about them and that their issues matter to us.",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We are designed a project by using synthetic biology, and created a mutualist bacteria that will <strong>protect bees against imidacloprid (one of the most common insecticide material)</strong> and reinforce bees immune system. </p>

<p><em>B. subtilis</em> will synthesis this protein continuously and this protein will give immunity against imidacloprid to bees.</p>
<p>In addition, we also designed another circuit, which improves bees natural immune system, by producing p-coumaric acid.

<p><b>BC’s “Dead” Pine Forests Are Not So Dead After All! </b></p>
<p><b>With one billion or more pine trees in BC killed as a result of the mountain pine beetle not including many states in the USA,  made
more ferocious by warmer temperatures, many scientists believe a significant line has been
crossed. Forests that once stored carbon are now major sources of greenhouse gas emissions.
Nature’s carbon bomb, as it were.</b></p>
<p>How many articles have you read about Global Warming or CO2 emissions polluting our atmosphere?  I’ve
read them all, and have reached a point in my life that I would prefer to do
something positive for our planet instead of just talking about it. My name is
Jan Olivier and I’m seeking your help to start reclaiming our earth, one step
at a time. Over my many years as an International business executive, I’ve learned
multiple times in solving problems that there is typically an abundance of talk
and very little action. I’m deeply concerned about the health of our planet and
have found a new, patented technology in Austria that can trap up to  100% of harmful CO2 emissions at their source and prevent it escaping into our atmosphere. </p>

BC’s “Dead” Pine Forests Are Not So Dead After All! 
With one billion or more pine trees in BC killed as a result of the mountain pine beetle not including many states in the USA,  made
more ferocious by warmer temperatures, many scientists believe a significant line has been
crossed. Forests that once stored carbon are now major sources of greenhouse gas emissions.
Nature’s carbon bomb, as it were.
How many articles have you read about Global Warming or CO2 emissions polluting our atmosphere?  I’ve
read them all, and have reached a point in my life that I would prefer to do
something positive for our planet instead of just talking about it. My name is
Jan Olivier and I’m seeking your help to start reclaiming our earth, one step
at a time. Over my many years as an International business executive, I’ve learned
multiple times in solving problems that there is typically an abundance of talk
and very little action. I’m deeply concerned about the health of our planet and
have found a new, patented technology in Austria that can trap up to  100% of harmful CO2 emissions at their source and prevent it escaping into our atmosphere. 
 
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYQQvz7EA5wI have spent three years researching and comparing every type of technology in this field, and I have come to the conclusion that this technology is by far head and shoulders above all others. This technology has a wide variety of significant applications, I live in beautiful British Columbia, Canada and I plan to start my
initiative to save the earth right here. I plan to take the millions of tons of waste wood that is in our forests  (millions of hectares of beetle kill) and in the cities
           (hundreds of thousands of tons of waste construction lumber that end up in our land fills) and process it through this new gasification technology, not incineration, no Co2 emissions and create high-grade bio-diesel and charcoal briquettes for the First Nation people of Canada in the USA and third world countries.
I have invested personally three years and hundreds of thousands of dollars in this initiative, but I need approximately
$350,000 more to complete the preparation for a lease to have the first product shipped and installed here in B.C. I understand
the amount I am asking to raise is significant, but I also know the value of
stopping CO2 emissions and helping the First Nations people by far overrides the cost, I am committed, the mere fact that I have spent all this time and money on it should speak for itself.


With success of this project we can acquire additional CO2
elimination products and expand to serve Native North American people, first Canada then the USA and even third world countries where there is abundant waste wood .
Imagine improving the lives of indigenous people in North America, the third world countries and at the
same time improve the health of Mother Earth for generations to come.
   What We Need & What You Get Let me be candid. I don't want $350,000 to invent something or try something. I need $350,000 to do something. The funds will be used Spartanly to complete the initial planning details to install a 500Kg per hour plant, this plant will process waste lumber with the end products being Charcoal and biodiesel, this plant is modular so I feel for this first one at 500Kg per hour is the right model that can be portable so we can move it to any site and demonstrate its uniqueness.

                                                  
The 500Kg  plant would operate 8050 hours per year and produce 1,500 tons of charcoal and 450,000 liters of biodiesel per year. The plant is low maintenance  as it has very few moving parts and operates at low temperatures. 
This technology has been developed by a European company, The successful negotiations to obtain rights to represent them throughout the Americas are complete.
The European company has agreed to come in for up to 50% of the cost of each plant, I plan to install the first unit in British Columbia Canada to help the indigenous First Nation people economically while eliminating  methane and CO2 emissions and reducing global warming. 
You can help make this a realty through your participation. I am offering some traditional crowd funding incentives for your contribution. Although not a formal business yet, and recognizing that in time this may be a significant business and I cannot offer equity shares for this type of investment... I offer an additional incentive for your contribution. 
Two years from the date of your participation, I will donate (in your name) 100% of your funding amount to the charity of your choice before any profits are taken from the business at that time. Think of it! You can help start an initiative that will help indigenous people, reduce global warming AND as a result have 100% of your funding returned to the charity of your choice. 
The time to help is now!   If not you, who?  If not now, when?
The Impact
 
There are millions of tons of waste wood available on First Nations reservations. This waste wood is the core resource to provide jobs and a new source of income to First Nation communities, and reduce global warming by converting it into usable products. My vision is to form a First Nations co-op that will market the charcoal and bio-diesel to wholesale or retail outlets. 




The technology we will install from Europe will convert this waste wood, that is passively emitting CO2 into the environment, into products commodities, such as charcoal for barbecuing and agriculture use as well as high quality bio-diesel.
The high quality bio-diesel produces is sulfur free and its production does not take any land that would otherwise be used for food crops as traditional bio-diesel producers do.
Once the first portable unit is up and operating it can then be relocated to different areas of the Reservation, to clean up other waste wood locations. This is a winning situation for First Nation communities and our environment. 
Re-mediating the problem
Important details of the patented technology we will bring to BC are:


It is pollution free
It is NOT incineration, it is a closed loop, flame less gasification system
It is installed and working in Europe
It traps harmful CO2 emissions and converts them to usable commercial commodities
It reduces Global Warming while providing jobs and commerce. 

Risks & Challenges
 From a management control perspective I have identified a small team of seasoned business people to operate the initiative with transparency, especially for review/audits by the First Nation people. The risks I face are not in the technology, which is proven in existing European locations. It's primarily in covering about three months of initial operating costs until revenue returns from outputs to fuel continued operations. I have established potential investors who would consider a bridge loan to the business should that situation arise, however my planning indicates the need for a bridge loan is less than 20%. 
My biggest challenge is just to complete this contribution request on Indiegogo as it will allow me to start my plans.

our pouches, which use 75% less plastic than the average laundry bottle, can be
converted back into diesel fuel and kept out of the waste stream completely. Help us collect and convert our pouches back into energy and eliminate plastic waste from the laundry washcycle. Pre-paid mailers and collection bins at retailers will close the  loop on puretergent's new clean for the 21st century.

        Quirky, but loveable upside down laundry pouch needs a ride home!
                                Puretergent wants its used pouches back!  

           
visit www.puretergent.com






Americans discard 1 BILLION laundry jugs each year.


And
only 9% get re-purchased for post-consumer content because supply outstrips
demand. Waste Management recycling centers don't collect #7 pouches: too many different
types, all requiring distinct processing. Help us raise the money so we can get them converted ourselves, using pre-paid mailers, and collection bins!

       
There Are Two Ways to Help:



1. Donate! We've got some great perks and the money we raise will help us print pre-paid reclamation envelopes (see above), install reclamation bins (like the one below) in select retail locations, and start a reclamation pilot program in one lucky city's recycling plant!



2. Pre-order Puretergent's Laundry Basket! Puretergent's
""laundry basket"" is a subscription service customized for your
household and includes an online custom re-ordering tool and an emergency panic
button, for those help! laundry emergency days. Choose your subscription level:
from one to 12 months and customize your formula assortment and quantity
according to your laundry needs. You can also order subscriptions for multiple
households—a great gift for new parents or sensitive skin families. Our laundry
formulas arrive each month on your doorstep with a reclaim prepaid postage
mailer included. When you're done with a pouch, you just mail it back to us!





Why
Puretergent?
Puretergent
doesn't contain any of the 20 known carcinogens in laundry
formulas: no
fillers, or dyes, or optical brighteners, no
chlorine, NPE's, APE's or sodium laurel
sulfate. Puretergent is all greywater safe,
which means that every drop of wash water can be
reused for landscaping. (The average person in the US uses 4,500
gallons of water a year—imagine if we could put all that water to good use?) Plus
it costs less than other “green” formulas at $13.99 for 50 washes
(which, in case you’re not a math wiz, works out to only 27 cents per load!)


The
herbal hypoallergenic formula is kind to your skin (perfect for those with skin
sensitivities!) and softens your clothes. It smells like fresh herbs in the
machine, yet leaves no lingering scent: Your clothes just smell like clean
fabric, and never blow toxic dryer fumes at the neighbors!



Perks

Exclusive Perk: Fresh One for South by Southwest 2015! Limited time only. 
$35 One limited edition Puretergent Pouch T-shirt with 2 Fresh travel samples (for whites and dirty stuff) and a Puretergent sticker + prepaid reclaim mailers.
                           
 
$10  #stopmakingbottles thank you sticker


$25+   Totes
(top row) or Laundry Bags (bottom row) are included in most donation levels $25
and over! Just let us know which color you'd like and it's yours!


What We Can Do With the Funds we Raise:




With $10,000, we can print pre-paid reclaim mailers for e-commerce orders.
With $25,000, we can install reclaim bins in existing retail stores.

With $50,000, we can install even more reclaim bins in existing retail stores!

With $75,000, we can start a pouch reclaim pilot program in a city (TBD) recycling plant!
$ Stretch goals: Create an additional city reclaim program at a recycling center, raise awareness about plastic pollution and recycling vs. re-purposing with school outreach contests and education.



Make a Real Impact!



Help us disrupt plastic pollution!  #stopmakingbottles



90%   ""Recycled"" plastic bottles end up as landfill or dumped at sea.

75%     Less plastic in a pouch vs a bottle. 


44%    Seabirds that have plastic bits ingested 


32          Million tons of plastic waste generated yearly in America


22%     Fish and sea life found with ingested plastic in their stomachs


20         Known carcinogens in mass AND natural laundry formulas
10x       Less emissions than rigid plastic bottles   










Puretergent Challenges


Scent addicts. Smells herbal fresh in the wash, smells like nothing when it's done. We just deliver just soft clean fabric.
Greenwashing. Loads of confusion around 'natural' laundry.
Damaging fabric to clean it.  Many people eat organic
but still launder toxic.

<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>PickEco Refills Ltd is Chilliwack’s choice zero waste grocery store, scheduled to open Summer 2018. If we can reach our $8000 contribution goal, PickEco will be purchasing a walk-in cooler. A walk-in cooler will allow us to increase cold storage and ensure that our valued customers have access to a wide range of fresh and affordable products.  A walk-in cooler will allow us to offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>cold foods on tap, think kombucha and tamari.</li>
<li>a larger selection of fresh items, like cheese and eggs (or what you plan to store)</li>
<li>additional cost savings, since we will be able to purchase products in even larger quantities and pass the savings directly to our customers.</li>
</ul>
<p>All contributors will receive perks, from high fives to DIY workshops, as a thank you for growing us towards our $8000 goal. Even if we fall short of our goal, any money raised will go towards increasing refrigeration at PickEco because we truly value your access to fresh well-priced products.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we want to ensure we give our customers the products they want, without the packaging they don’t need.</p>
<p>You want to help but you can't contribute?  That's ok!  I understand that not everybody is able to help financially.  Please spread the news ""PickEco Refills is coming to Chilliwack, BC!""  We love social media shout outs and good old fashion volunteering.</p>

<p>Have you seen ""A Plastic Ocean”?  Have you looked around while driving along Canada's Highways?  We are drowning in single use plastic.  While I encourage everybody to Reduce, Reuse and Recycle, we need more than this to have an impact. We need change and we need it now. Do your part and send less waste to the landfill, start with your groceries and work your way out from there, I promise, its satisfying and doesn't have to be hard.</p>
<p>I have been inspired by other stores in beautiful British Columbia that are giving people options to shop garbage free. ""Why not a change in Chilliwack?""   Chilliwack is filled with wide open spaces, trails, rivers, and lakes that all deserve more respect than they are getting.  PickEco is on its way soon and will give people options to shop for groceries and local products with greatly reduced waste.</p>

<p>The Ganges River System in India and Bangladesh carries an estimated 100,000 -170,000 tonnes per year of plastic packaging into the ocean from its opening in the Bay of Bengal. This single river system is estimated to account for around 10% of global, river-based plastic pollution. A survey carried out by NGO, Polluting Plastics in June 2017 of Bangladeshi recycling companies indicate that there is a strong market for recycled plastics, fetching $300-$400 US per tonne. The majority of plastic flowing through the world’s waterways are plastic bottles, bags and food packaging, all of which are fully recyclable into products such as clothing fabric, furniture and other useful products. Indeed, because now 90-100% of all plastic is recyclable, a simple calculation puts the net worth of the plastic in this river at between the ranges of $30 million to $50 million USD per year. Trash Wheel interceptors designed and installed by US company ClearWater Mills have been successfully implemented in the USA. The prototype has shown the ability to collect 90-95% of plastic pollution before it enters the ocean from the Baltimore Harbour in Maryland, USA. Rather than allowing this plastic to flow into the ocean, Polluting Plastics, based in Australia - proposes a way to systematically remove the plastic from the river at the Meghna River, near the town of Chandpur. This would be both an environmental and economic victory for the people of Chandpur district and the people of Bangladesh who use the Meghna River system for fishing and aquaculture. The location just south of Chandpur is thought to be ideal due to the river’s narrow shape at this point (2km wide) and relative proximity to the ocean – meaning it will collect maximum amounts of plastic from not only the Ganges/Meghna Rivers but also the Buriganga River (flowing through the Bangla capital of Dhaka) and its tributaries. A number of Bangladeshi recycling companies have already enthusiastically shown interest in processing the waste that comes out of the river at this proposed location. </p>
<p>A site visit by representatives by Polluting Plastics and a ClearWater Mills consultant is now the necessary next step to ensure backing from the local and federal authorities on the project, as well as obtaining their cooperation. The purpose of this particular crowd-funding campaign is to fund this trip.</p>
<p> ClearWater Mills, the creators of Mr Trash Wheel are already on board with this project. Polluting Plastics consists of environmentalists, including at least one Bangladeshi national who will join us on our initial visit to engage with the Bangladesh authorities. Once this hurdle is overcome, we will be able to entice new funders, such as the Bangladeshi Government, to invest in the project. With a $50 million dollar annual return, the financial incentive should guide us over this final hurdle to project completion.</p>

Because of their unique traits, Sea Turtles are vulnerable to all kinds of things like ocean plastic, beach front development and artificial lighting which confuses nesting mothers and hatchlings, leaving them stranded.  Like many species today, multiple challenging threats are impacting the world’s Sea Turtles making it critical that we get creative and use every tool in the toolkit to secure a future for these beautiful and gentle ancient mariners.</p><p>The <a href=""http://wildlifefriendly.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wildlife Friendly Enterprise Network</a> is thrilled to announce that we are working on the launch of <a href=""http://wildlifefriendly.org/sea-turtle-friendly/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Sea Turtle Friendly™</strong></a> tourism—the world’s first global Sea Turtle standards! By partnering with the travel and hospitality industry, as well as local communities, <strong>Sea Turtle Friendly™</strong> will give tourists opportunities to contribute directly to Sea Turtle conservation by choosing certified destinations for their journeys.</p><p><strong>The Problem: Sea Turtles are Globally at Risk From Human-Induced Threats</strong></p><p>Sea Turtles are a much-loved symbol of the tropics and an indicator species for the health of the marine environment.  Adventurous tourists seek out snorkeling or diving opportunities to see them swimming in the wild.

Because of their unique traits, Sea Turtles are vulnerable to all kinds of things like ocean plastic, beach front development and artificial lighting which confuses nesting mothers and hatchlings, leaving them stranded.  Like many species today, multiple challenging threats are impacting the world’s Sea Turtles making it critical that we get creative and use every tool in the toolkit to secure a future for these beautiful and gentle ancient mariners.The Wildlife Friendly Enterprise Network is thrilled to announce that we are working on the launch of Sea Turtle Friendly™ tourism—the world’s first global Sea Turtle standards! By partnering with the travel and hospitality industry, as well as local communities, Sea Turtle Friendly™ will give tourists opportunities to contribute directly to Sea Turtle conservation by choosing certified destinations for their journeys.The Problem: Sea Turtles are Globally at Risk From Human-Induced ThreatsSea Turtles are a much-loved symbol of the tropics and an indicator species for the health of the marine environment.  Adventurous tourists seek out snorkeling or diving opportunities to see them swimming in the wild.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Overview</h2>
<p>Climate change is expected to accelerate the loss of species as land, sea, and freshwater habitats face damage and loss. This is especially true for cold-water fish such as salmonids. This imminent crisis not only concerns biologists. Human beings have been closely connected to the diversity of various species spiritually, culturally, socially, economically, and personally.  The Great Salmon Tour aims to engage people in the conservation of biodiversity of salmon by allowing them to experience the diverse bonds that exist between salmon and people. Every fish has a <a href=""https://voicesforbiodiversity.org/articles/the-great-salmon-tour-project"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">story</a> – a story that is inseparable from our lives. Whatever that story may be, the Great Salmon Tour seeks to tell it through film, oral history recordings, social media, and publications.</p>
<p>We have a series of species and locations that we plan to visit. In 2020, we journey to uncover the legendary <strong>Atlantic salmon fisheries in Maine</strong> and the ongoing efforts to save the species from going extinct, visiting <strong>salmon cartels in Spain</strong>, and documenting <strong>reef netters of the Pacific Northwest</strong>.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Our Story</h2>
<p>My first job after moving to the U.S. from Norway was to work on the recovery of salmon populations in California for the National Marine Fisheries Service. One day a coworker asked me about the European <i>Hucho hucho</i> species.  Although I come from Europe, I drew a blank.</p>
<p>“The large river salmon,” he said. At that time, I just started learning about the many types of salmon in the Pacific Northwest, and I was intrigued.  As far as I was concerned, Europe only had the generic salmon and brown trout, and this new genus spurred my interest in the diversity of these widespread species.</p>
<p>As I learned more about the various species of salmon and the existential threats they face, I decided that I wanted to see them all and explore the status of these fish around the world. However, I soon realized that there was another story that needs to be told –that the story of salmon is as much about people as it is about the fish. There has always been a deeper connection between people and salmon that have gone beyond nutritional or economic needs. This bond consists of cultural and spiritual values, local knowledge and practices, traditions, and social identities. So, when we lose the biological diversity of salmonids, we lose not only the fish species but also our own <a href=""https://voicesforbiodiversity.org/galleries/videos/the-great-salmon-tour"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">cultural heritage</a>.   </p>
<p>So, I created the Great Salmon Tour to see all the salmon species and explore the deep cultural and personal connections that people have with these fish. The goal is to engage people in the conservation of salmon diversity through the Great Salmon Tour expeditions.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579668055/giwqisnyc071se9nvb89.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In 2010, we visited Tanana Village along the Yukon River in Alaska to experience salmon subsistence fishing; we journeyed across Mongolia to see the mythical taimen salmon; we spoke with fishermen on the last small boat fishery for Chinook salmon in California; and we discovered an inspiring story of conservation of softmouth trout in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Afterward, we gave lectures about our findings from our tour in universities and non-governmental organizations in the Washington DC area and West Virginia, published an <a href=""https://voicesforbiodiversity.org/articles/the-great-salmon-tour-project"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">article</a> about the biodiversity of salmon and their connections to people based on our expeditions, and we produced documentary videos.</p>
<p>This time our goal is to explore and document the stories of fish and men in Washington, Maine, and Spain.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What is the Project About?</h2>
<p>Ultimately, it is about conservation of salmon. It is about understanding our own heritage and documenting it before it is lost, and it is about our future.</p>
<p>It is difficult for the general public to be concerned about a species that they do not know. It is particularly hard to engage them in conservation of non-exotic species, such as salmon fishes. Also, given the availability of aquaculture fish in restaurants and markets, the general public is less aware that many of these species are critically endangered. Telling the story of salmon and what it means to various communities will increase awareness about the diversity of salmonids and show that their loss will have a direct impact on us, human beings. We believe that focusing attention on the diversity of salmon and our connections with them will help in the conservation, protection, and recovery efforts of these species. And we will put a limelight on the issue by telling the stories through multiple media and venues.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Will Do</h2>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Expeditions</strong></h3>
<p><strong>In 2020, the Great Salmon Tour will visit Maine, USA, and the Autonomous Region of Asturias, Spain, to make a documentary about the native Atlantic salmon and what happens when the salmon runs are lost.</strong> Through our visits and interviews, we will compare the two cultures and their similar traditions linked to the Atlantic salmon runs. But the current conditions are not the same between the two places.</p>
<p>Fishing for native wild Atlantic salmon in the U.S. became illegal when the Maine salmon was listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act in 2000. The situation in Maine is an illustration of what people and communities lose when the salmon runs disappear, and it is a stark warning of what the future for Asturias may be if the Spaniards do not find a way to manage sustainable runs. We are excited about continuing our project and expeditions.</p>
<p><strong>We will also travel to Washington to learn about and document salmon reefnet fishing. </strong>Wild Pacific salmon reefnet fishing is a historical Pacific Northwest fishing method- the oldest known salmon net fishery in the world. Once practiced throughout the Salish Sea by its many indigenous peoples it is now only done in three places through a cooperative effort between Lummi Nation tribal members and Lummi Island Wild.</p>
<p>We have already cultivated connections and logistical support for each of these locations, but traveling to these sites will ultimately depend on our funding efforts and practical considerations. To tell these stories, my team and I will contribute a significant amount of personal assets, such as equipment and time. Thus, our first goal now is to cover the basic expenses for travel and logistics for team members who will undertake this work.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>You as a Participant</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The project will allow you to be a vital participant</strong> in this tour through film, photographs, and articles. We will keep updates about our journey on social media and our blog so you can interact with us as we prepare, plan, and travel. </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Oral History</strong></h3>
<p>Importantly, the essence of the Great Salmon Tour is the recognition that biological diversity is intrinsic to the vitality of human culture and human history. Therefore, we will videotape stories of individuals, families, important events, and everyday life of communities tied to salmon to create <strong>oral history recordings</strong>. The recordings will be loaded on the Voices of the Fisheries and other historic societies repositories where they will be available for researchers and the public. They will also be available on our website.</p>
<p>The timing of this project is important; the recreational fishery for Atlantic salmon in Maine has been closed for over 20 years; the Atlantic salmon in Spain is on the southern edge of the species distribution and is threatened by climate change; and it is unclear if the young generation is interested in continuing the reef netting in Washington. Thus, the fishermen are getting older, with only a few remaining individuals that can share their experiences. This is a unique time and opportunity to capture their stories, learn from these case studies, and celebrate their knowledge to garner continued support for efforts to restore and conserve salmon.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Films</strong></h3>
<p>A video cam<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581703627/ti32ijttaitjp02jpus3.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>era will be our primary equipment during our travels. We will produce short videos while traveling and longer documentaries once we are back home and in our editing studio. This will allow us to build an archive of <strong>high-quality visual mate</strong><strong>rials</strong> about the entire experience. We strive to represent the uniqueness of the salmon fishes and people in stunning places that we will be visiting. Videos will be shared on our website and via social media</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Presentations</strong></h3>
<p>People do not care about something they have not heard about. So, we spread the word about intricate ties between salmon and people by <strong>giving presentations</strong> at schools, universities, organizations, etc. Following our expeditions to Alaska, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mongolia, and Virginia, we gave presentations at university classes, local American Fisheries Society charters, Café Scientifique meetings, and other venues in D.C., Maryland, Minnesota, and West Virginia. We will make a new round of presentations following our expeditions to Washington State, Maine, and Spain.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Publications</strong></h3>
<p>We will <strong>write about our findings </strong>about fish and men on our website and external publications. We will also produce our own magazines covering the great salmon diversity, which can be purchased online but <strong>you can be one of the first recipients of our original three first magazines as a prize for your donation</strong>!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>We need funds for travel expenses to and from our locations, on-site logistics for two team members who will undertake this work, and a translator in Spain.  We also need to update some of our film equipment. At last, we need funds to create a professional and interactive Great Salmon Tour website. Please rest assured that whether or not we reach our ambitious goal, all contributions will only go to the development of the project.</p>
<p>We send a postcard with hand written personal thank you to all of our supporters. We also have cups and t-shirts to share. Or maybe you want to be recognized as a golden sponsor or producer of our films? There is a perk for that. And let us know if you have a business you want to promote and we can add your logo to our sponsor list that comes with the material we produce. If you like to read. Then our magazines are for you.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding Salmon as Food. </strong>Restaurants commonly advertise just salmon on their menu despite that in the U.S. alone there are six different species of fish called salmon and that each species is unique in the flavor and texture of its flesh. Adding the other salmonid fishes such as Artic char, steelhead, rainbow trout, brown trout, etc. and you have the possibility of a gourmet fest. Our “Understanding Salmon as Food” magazine introduces you to the gastronomic variation that meets you once you journey beyond farm raised Atlantic salmon, explains the biology that affects the differences between the species in the quality of their flesh, and gives you a series of recipes from around the world to explore. This is a must book for anyone claiming to be a foodie, chef, or salmon connoisseur.</p>
<p><strong>The Diversity of Salmonid Fishes. </strong>​Though biodiversity has become a familiar term in mainstream media, it continues to be an abstract concept for many people. However, sallmon and trout are nor abstract. There are nearly 200 species of salmonids, and the planet is very close to losing several of them. The salmon diversity magazine discusses in engaging ways biodiversity in general and salmonids in particular, presents the reader to many of the salmon species out there and the threats they face, and tells captivating stories of loss and conservation of biodiversity.</p>
<p><strong>Tales from the Great Salmon Tour Expeditions. </strong>Between 2010 and 2012 I traveled several places to document salmon and what these fish means to people. I met fishermen from the small boat salmon fishery in California to learn what Chinook salmon means for them, traveled to Tanana village along the Yukon River in Alaska to experience subsistence fishery for salmon, drove across the roadless Mongolian tundra to find out how Buddhism helps conserve taimen salmon, and I visited researchers in Bosnia-Herzegovinia to find out how small fish farms and local pride may help with recovery of the endemic softmouth trout. I also drove up to the mountains in Virginia where I joined a local fly fisherman to find native brook trout. Stories from these trips and the experiences I had are collected in The Great Salmon Tour 2010 magazine.</p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<div>
<p>The concept of biodiversity can be abstract. Nature programs on TV and environmental organizations often give the impression that biodiversity is just about endangered animals, such as elephants or rhinos, in exotic places. Therefore, many people think of biodiversity as something remote, but not necessarily something close to where they live or as an integral part of their diet or lives.</p>
<p>The Great Salmon Tour brings the concept of biodiversity home by demonstrating that biodiversity is not only about exotic animals in faraway places, it is also about something as familiar as the fish in your local river or on your dinner plate.</p>
<p>Telling the story of salmon and its deep meaning to people and communities will raise awareness about the threats facing salmonid fishes and what their potential loss may mean to us. Your support will help raise the awareness that will result in conservation, protection, and recovery of these species. It will also result in support to local communities striving to preserve their local knowledge, practices, and social/cultural systems. Preserving the connection between people and fish will help leveraging efforts to conserve the ecosystems that salmon fishes depend on.</p>
<p>As we lose salmon species and populations, we also lose our own heritage. We will provide the oral history recordings to various historical societies where they will be archived and made available to both the public and researchers. Thus, by supporting this project you will help preserve local knowledge and practices, traditions, and social/cultural systems for future generations.</p>
<p>From 2010 to 2012 we covered several species and communities. Following our expeditions, we gave presentations at universities, schools, and non-profit organizations. We created films and published articles about cultural and social connections between salmonids and people in online magazines. In our upcoming expeditions, we will continue to build on the work that we started in 2010. We believe this effort will have a real impact on the conservation of salmonids and you can help in it.</p>
<p> </p>

</div></div>","Overview
Climate change is expected to accelerate the loss of species as land, sea, and freshwater habitats face damage and loss. This is especially true for cold-water fish such as salmonids. This imminent crisis not only concerns biologists. Human beings have been closely connected to the diversity of various species spiritually, culturally, socially, economically, and personally.  The Great Salmon Tour aims to engage people in the conservation of biodiversity of salmon by allowing them to experience the diverse bonds that exist between salmon and people. Every fish has a story – a story that is inseparable from our lives. Whatever that story may be, the Great Salmon Tour seeks to tell it through film, oral history recordings, social media, and publications.
We have a series of species and locations that we plan to visit. In 2020, we journey to uncover the legendary Atlantic salmon fisheries in Maine and the ongoing efforts to save the species from going extinct, visiting salmon cartels in Spain, and documenting reef netters of the Pacific Northwest.
Our Story
My first job after moving to the U.S. from Norway was to work on the recovery of salmon populations in California for the National Marine Fisheries Service. One day a coworker asked me about the European Hucho hucho species.  Although I come from Europe, I drew a blank.
“The large river salmon,” he said. At that time, I just started learning about the many types of salmon in the Pacific Northwest, and I was intrigued.  As far as I was concerned, Europe only had the generic salmon and brown trout, and this new genus spurred my interest in the diversity of these widespread species.
As I learned more about the various species of salmon and the existential threats they face, I decided that I wanted to see them all and explore the status of these fish around the world. However, I soon realized that there was another story that needs to be told –that the story of salmon is as much about people as it is about the fish. There has always been a deeper connection between people and salmon that have gone beyond nutritional or economic needs. This bond consists of cultural and spiritual values, local knowledge and practices, traditions, and social identities. So, when we lose the biological diversity of salmonids, we lose not only the fish species but also our own cultural heritage.   
So, I created the Great Salmon Tour to see all the salmon species and explore the deep cultural and personal connections that people have with these fish. The goal is to engage people in the conservation of salmon diversity through the Great Salmon Tour expeditions.

In 2010, we visited Tanana Village along the Yukon River in Alaska to experience salmon subsistence fishing; we journeyed across Mongolia to see the mythical taimen salmon; we spoke with fishermen on the last small boat fishery for Chinook salmon in California; and we discovered an inspiring story of conservation of softmouth trout in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Afterward, we gave lectures about our findings from our tour in universities and non-governmental organizations in the Washington DC area and West Virginia, published an article about the biodiversity of salmon and their connections to people based on our expeditions, and we produced documentary videos.
This time our goal is to explore and document the stories of fish and men in Washington, Maine, and Spain.
What is the Project About?
Ultimately, it is about conservation of salmon. It is about understanding our own heritage and documenting it before it is lost, and it is about our future.
It is difficult for the general public to be concerned about a species that they do not know. It is particularly hard to engage them in conservation of non-exotic species, such as salmon fishes. Also, given the availability of aquaculture fish in restaurants and markets, the general public is less aware that many of these species are critically endangered. Telling the story of salmon and what it means to various communities will increase awareness about the diversity of salmonids and show that their loss will have a direct impact on us, human beings. We believe that focusing attention on the diversity of salmon and our connections with them will help in the conservation, protection, and recovery efforts of these species. And we will put a limelight on the issue by telling the stories through multiple media and venues.
 
What We Will Do
Expeditions
In 2020, the Great Salmon Tour will visit Maine, USA, and the Autonomous Region of Asturias, Spain, to make a documentary about the native Atlantic salmon and what happens when the salmon runs are lost. Through our visits and interviews, we will compare the two cultures and their similar traditions linked to the Atlantic salmon runs. But the current conditions are not the same between the two places.
Fishing for native wild Atlantic salmon in the U.S. became illegal when the Maine salmon was listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act in 2000. The situation in Maine is an illustration of what people and communities lose when the salmon runs disappear, and it is a stark warning of what the future for Asturias may be if the Spaniards do not find a way to manage sustainable runs. We are excited about continuing our project and expeditions.
We will also travel to Washington to learn about and document salmon reefnet fishing. Wild Pacific salmon reefnet fishing is a historical Pacific Northwest fishing method- the oldest known salmon net fishery in the world. Once practiced throughout the Salish Sea by its many indigenous peoples it is now only done in three places through a cooperative effort between Lummi Nation tribal members and Lummi Island Wild.
We have already cultivated connections and logistical support for each of these locations, but traveling to these sites will ultimately depend on our funding efforts and practical considerations. To tell these stories, my team and I will contribute a significant amount of personal assets, such as equipment and time. Thus, our first goal now is to cover the basic expenses for travel and logistics for team members who will undertake this work.
You as a Participant
The project will allow you to be a vital participant in this tour through film, photographs, and articles. We will keep updates about our journey on social media and our blog so you can interact with us as we prepare, plan, and travel. 
Oral History
Importantly, the essence of the Great Salmon Tour is the recognition that biological diversity is intrinsic to the vitality of human culture and human history. Therefore, we will videotape stories of individuals, families, important events, and everyday life of communities tied to salmon to create oral history recordings. The recordings will be loaded on the Voices of the Fisheries and other historic societies repositories where they will be available for researchers and the public. They will also be available on our website.
The timing of this project is important; the recreational fishery for Atlantic salmon in Maine has been closed for over 20 years; the Atlantic salmon in Spain is on the southern edge of the species distribution and is threatened by climate change; and it is unclear if the young generation is interested in continuing the reef netting in Washington. Thus, the fishermen are getting older, with only a few remaining individuals that can share their experiences. This is a unique time and opportunity to capture their stories, learn from these case studies, and celebrate their knowledge to garner continued support for efforts to restore and conserve salmon.
Films
A video camera will be our primary equipment during our travels. We will produce short videos while traveling and longer documentaries once we are back home and in our editing studio. This will allow us to build an archive of high-quality visual materials about the entire experience. We strive to represent the uniqueness of the salmon fishes and people in stunning places that we will be visiting. Videos will be shared on our website and via social media
Presentations
People do not care about something they have not heard about. So, we spread the word about intricate ties between salmon and people by giving presentations at schools, universities, organizations, etc. Following our expeditions to Alaska, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mongolia, and Virginia, we gave presentations at university classes, local American Fisheries Society charters, Café Scientifique meetings, and other venues in D.C., Maryland, Minnesota, and West Virginia. We will make a new round of presentations following our expeditions to Washington State, Maine, and Spain.
Publications
We will write about our findings about fish and men on our website and external publications. We will also produce our own magazines covering the great salmon diversity, which can be purchased online but you can be one of the first recipients of our original three first magazines as a prize for your donation!
 

What We Need & What You Get
We need funds for travel expenses to and from our locations, on-site logistics for two team members who will undertake this work, and a translator in Spain.  We also need to update some of our film equipment. At last, we need funds to create a professional and interactive Great Salmon Tour website. Please rest assured that whether or not we reach our ambitious goal, all contributions will only go to the development of the project.
We send a postcard with hand written personal thank you to all of our supporters. We also have cups and t-shirts to share. Or maybe you want to be recognized as a golden sponsor or producer of our films? There is a perk for that. And let us know if you have a business you want to promote and we can add your logo to our sponsor list that comes with the material we produce. If you like to read. Then our magazines are for you.
Understanding Salmon as Food. Restaurants commonly advertise just salmon on their menu despite that in the U.S. alone there are six different species of fish called salmon and that each species is unique in the flavor and texture of its flesh. Adding the other salmonid fishes such as Artic char, steelhead, rainbow trout, brown trout, etc. and you have the possibility of a gourmet fest. Our “Understanding Salmon as Food” magazine introduces you to the gastronomic variation that meets you once you journey beyond farm raised Atlantic salmon, explains the biology that affects the differences between the species in the quality of their flesh, and gives you a series of recipes from around the world to explore. This is a must book for anyone claiming to be a foodie, chef, or salmon connoisseur.
The Diversity of Salmonid Fishes. ​Though biodiversity has become a familiar term in mainstream media, it continues to be an abstract concept for many people. However, sallmon and trout are nor abstract. There are nearly 200 species of salmonids, and the planet is very close to losing several of them. The salmon diversity magazine discusses in engaging ways biodiversity in general and salmonids in particular, presents the reader to many of the salmon species out there and the threats they face, and tells captivating stories of loss and conservation of biodiversity.
Tales from the Great Salmon Tour Expeditions. Between 2010 and 2012 I traveled several places to document salmon and what these fish means to people. I met fishermen from the small boat salmon fishery in California to learn what Chinook salmon means for them, traveled to Tanana village along the Yukon River in Alaska to experience subsistence fishery for salmon, drove across the roadless Mongolian tundra to find out how Buddhism helps conserve taimen salmon, and I visited researchers in Bosnia-Herzegovinia to find out how small fish farms and local pride may help with recovery of the endemic softmouth trout. I also drove up to the mountains in Virginia where I joined a local fly fisherman to find native brook trout. Stories from these trips and the experiences I had are collected in The Great Salmon Tour 2010 magazine.
The Impact

The concept of biodiversity can be abstract. Nature programs on TV and environmental organizations often give the impression that biodiversity is just about endangered animals, such as elephants or rhinos, in exotic places. Therefore, many people think of biodiversity as something remote, but not necessarily something close to where they live or as an integral part of their diet or lives.
The Great Salmon Tour brings the concept of biodiversity home by demonstrating that biodiversity is not only about exotic animals in faraway places, it is also about something as familiar as the fish in your local river or on your dinner plate.
Telling the story of salmon and its deep meaning to people and communities will raise awareness about the threats facing salmonid fishes and what their potential loss may mean to us. Your support will help raise the awareness that will result in conservation, protection, and recovery of these species. It will also result in support to local communities striving to preserve their local knowledge, practices, and social/cultural systems. Preserving the connection between people and fish will help leveraging efforts to conserve the ecosystems that salmon fishes depend on.
As we lose salmon species and populations, we also lose our own heritage. We will provide the oral history recordings to various historical societies where they will be archived and made available to both the public and researchers. Thus, by supporting this project you will help preserve local knowledge and practices, traditions, and social/cultural systems for future generations.
From 2010 to 2012 we covered several species and communities. Following our expeditions, we gave presentations at universities, schools, and non-profit organizations. We created films and published articles about cultural and social connections between salmonids and people in online magazines. In our upcoming expeditions, we will continue to build on the work that we started in 2010. We believe this effort will have a real impact on the conservation of salmonids and you can help in it.
 

Risks and Challenges
There is a risk that planned locations may not be easily accessible, for example, some of the locations are remote and may require special logistical planning. There are a number of factors to incorporate in these decisions, including weather and available resources, but I have successfully overcome and negotiated these obstacles in previous expeditions.

The influx of tourism and the lack of its appropriate management has been conflicting with our day to day lives as residents for over a decade. Surveys conducted over the last two years estimates the highway to be four times over visitor capacity and now considered to be insufficient to serve the current level of use which creates issues such as overcrowding, illegal parking, hazardous driving conditions, rampant trespassing on private property leading to visitor injuries requiring emergency rescues, excessive unlicensed commercial activity triggering economic adversities, waste disposal concerns including public facility cleanliness, pluming issues leading to stream and ocean contamination, health hazards and death. Read the 9-9-18 StarAdvertise, article here RESTORING BALANCEOver the last two years we have collected data through roadside surveying, traffic studies, visitor questionnaires, web surveillance and natural resource monitoring. With this information we have formulated a plan aimed to reduce the impact of the visitor industry and further refine the methods to best protect the natural resources of our home. Read the 9-11-16 Maui News, article here PREVENTATIVE MEASURESThe Hana Highway Regulation has published a Road to Hana Code of Conduct found at HanaHighwayRegulation.com In partnership with the visitor’s bureau, the Hana Community Association is developing educational resources in the form of an infographic brochure and preparedness video to enhance visitor safety. Additionally the organization is working with the Department of Transportation and Public Utilities Commission to increase roadside signage and commercial industry oversight.Read the 6-14-17 Maui News, article hereAlthough the components mentioned above have and will provide some preventative measures, we have determined that in-the-field advising is our only line of effective defense to the level of desecration we are enduring.

Kafuga Pocket Forest is under threat as tea growers want to clear it to make new plantations. Kafuga is part of a landscape of international importance and the richest conservation area in Uganda owing to the exceptional diversity of its flora and fauna.


Kafuga Forest is on the fringes of the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park - a UNESCO World Heritage site in South West Uganda which is home to many different species of plants and animals and 400 of the world's remaining 880 Mountain Gorillas. This critically endangered species will come under greater threat if the deforestation goes ahead. 
For the local villagers, Kafuga Forest is very important. It is:


o the source of water, fruits, poles and fodder for the cattle;
o the forest that helps to bring rain for the crops;
o their home, where local people have always lived and have developed their cultural heritage for their children to enjoy.



What We Need
With this campaign we are supporting Pro-Biodiversity Conservationists in Uganda (PROBICOU), a non-governmental organisation active in the area and committed to protect Kafuga Pocket Forest against deforestation, to save it from encroachment, restore already lost sections by planting trees and providing for its sustainable management. 
The goals are:



to map the forest


secure its boundaries

engage the local community and local government in its conservation

preserve this precious ecosystem against commercial interests.


When we raise enough funds and meet our target PROBICOU will be able to restore Kafuga Forest by planting 30,000 native trees.










YOU can help today!Be part of the campaign! 
Make a donation NOW and directly help more than 18,310 local people.

Your donation will help to save around 250 hectares of Kafuga Pocket Forest in Uganda*.


*All funds raised toward our target will go to PROBICOU to map and protect the Forest.  Any extra funds over the target will go towards funding similar International Tree Foundation natural forest preservation and restoration projects.

</p>
<p>So Reclaim the Power is holding another action camp from Friday 29th May to Monday 2nd June near Didcot Power Station in Oxfordshire. <br/></p>
<p>Reclaim
the Power is a direct action network aiming to join the dots between
environmental, economic and social justice.  The network have
organised two successful anti-fracking action camps at Balcombe
(2013) and Blackpool (2014). In addition we stand in solidarity with 
communities fighting fracking in their areas like the Preston Road
protection camp in Blackpool, Barton Moss in Manchester, Balcombe in
Sussex, Crawbury Hill in Yorkshire among others. 
</p>
<ul> <li>This year, we are going to Didcot! <br/>
</li> <li>
<p>This
is part of a European day of action against corporate influence on
the COP21 process and also to maintain momentum regardless of the
General Election result in the UK.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The camp will aim to;</p></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Draw
	public attention to the re-emerging threat of 'old coal' and the
	government's plans for new gas fired powerstations, partly supplied
	by fracked shale gas.</li>
<li> Provide
	a radicalising and participatory experience for the resurgent
	climate movement in the UK – which will help to build momentum for
	COP21 in December 2015.  </li>
</ol>
<p>Last year in Blackpool, we were able to host a successful action camp in the Blackpool
area in support of local residents fighting Cuadrilla's plans for
commercial scale fracking.  Around 1000 people attended the six day
event at Preston New Road; culminating in a day of direct action at

So Reclaim the Power is holding another action camp from Friday 29th May to Monday 2nd June near Didcot Power Station in Oxfordshire. 
Reclaim
the Power is a direct action network aiming to join the dots between
environmental, economic and social justice.  The network have
organised two successful anti-fracking action camps at Balcombe
(2013) and Blackpool (2014). In addition we stand in solidarity with 
communities fighting fracking in their areas like the Preston Road
protection camp in Blackpool, Barton Moss in Manchester, Balcombe in
Sussex, Crawbury Hill in Yorkshire among others. 

 This year, we are going to Didcot! 
 
This
is part of a European day of action against corporate influence on
the COP21 process and also to maintain momentum regardless of the
General Election result in the UK.

The camp will aim to;


Draw
	public attention to the re-emerging threat of 'old coal' and the
	government's plans for new gas fired powerstations, partly supplied
	by fracked shale gas.
 Provide
	a radicalising and participatory experience for the resurgent
	climate movement in the UK – which will help to build momentum for
	COP21 in December 2015.  

Last year in Blackpool, we were able to host a successful action camp in the Blackpool
area in support of local residents fighting Cuadrilla's plans for
commercial scale fracking.  Around 1000 people attended the six day
event at Preston New Road; culminating in a day of direct action at
thirteen
different fracking-related sites
across the country including:





Occupying
	Cuadrilla's regional offices
	in Blackpool


A
	super-glue action at the Department for the Environment and Rural
	Affairs
	in protest at their redaction of their report into the impacts of
	fracking on house prices.


A
	protest blockade of Rathlin's energy drill pad at Crawberry Hill,
	East Yorkshire drawing attention to the company's well safety
	failures at another nearby site at West Newton.


A
	blockade of the London headquarters of fracking firm Igas.


A
	blockade of Swansea University's extreme energy research centre.




     What We Need  We're looking to raise around £2000, this will help us put on the best camp yet! 
 £2000 can pay for;




	Strawbales
	for people to sit on during workshops (£300)

Wooden walkway boards for wheelchair access (£450)


	Sound
	system hire for plenary events (£450)

400
	camp programmes explaining the climate threat of fossil fuels and
	workshop timetable (£250) 
	



	Phone
	credit for media and legal teams (£100)



	Compost
	loos (£250)



	Recycling
	and Waste management  (£200)





 
	
	
	
	Here is a quote from a participant of the 2014 camp:“I
just wanted to tell you again how glad I am that I went to Reclaim
the Power. So many opportunities have arisen out of it. I'm already

islands, the Republic of the Philippines has one of the highest rates of
amphibian endemism on the planet; 79% of the Republic's species of amphibians
are found nowhere else in the world<a rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span>[1]</span></span></span></a>.  This biodiversity hotspot is currently under
threat, as 46% of the amphibian species of the Philippines have been declared
at-risk of extinction<a rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span>[2]</span></span></a>.</p>
<p>As
with other areas of the world with rapid development, the Philippines is
experiencing the conversion of wild areas to urbanized settings and large-scale
agriculture.  The effects of such
alteration of the ecosystem are felt much more quickly on an island; the
reduction of suitable habitat has resulted in pressure on Philippine amphibians
that is compounded by the effects of climate change. A study found that the
highly virulent disease Chytridiomycosis was present in the Philippines in 2008
and spread quickly; at a locality in Luzon showed that nearly 75% of
individuals tested were infected<a rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span>[3]</span></span></span></a>.
The disease can be difficult to defeat; although infected frogs can be
successfully treated, once they are released back to the wild, they are
vulnerable for reinfection.  One of the more
popular conservation methods in use is to develop local ex-situ breeding programs,
which involves taking several individuals of at-risk species from the wild,
testing them to ensure they are free of Chytrid, and then keeping them in
terrariums that attempt to mimic appropriate habitat conditions. The terrariums
are kept in a biosecure area, and there are extensive sterilization measures in
place to ensure that Chytrid and other diseases cannot be brought into the room
where the breeding program is taking place.</p>
<p>I
am relocating to Los Baños, Laguna, Philippines, to develop a pilot ex-situ program at the campus.
The project will focus on enticing endemic species of the genus <i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platymantis"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Platymantis</a></i> (Family <i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceratobatrachidae"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ceratobatrachidae</a></i>) to breed in captivity. Four
species, <i><a href=""http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/58464/0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Platymantis luzonensis</a>, <a href=""http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/58469/0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">P. mimulus</a>, <a href=""http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/58456/0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">P. corrugatus</a>, </i>and<i> </i><a href=""http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/58458/0"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>P. dorsalis</i> </a>will be collected for this captive breeding study.  The genus <i>Platymantis</i>
was chosen because in addition to conservation issues, there is much to be learned about the life cycle of <i>Platymantis</i>
frogs.  </p>
<p>All four species
of <i>Platymantis</i> chosen for this
project are endemic to the island of Luzon<i>.  P. luzonensis</i> and <i>P. mimulus</i> are listed by the IUCN as “Near Threatened”.  <i>P.
corrugatus</i> and <i>P. dorsalis</i> are
currently not listed at threatened by the IUCN; however, they are
listed as having a population trend of “decreasing”.  This project aims to anticipate and offset what
is likely to be a continuing decrease in population, especially as the
Philippines continues to develop.</p>
<p>These funds will be used for two purposes: (1) setup materials and ongoing maintenance ($3,000) and (2) a stipend for one academic year for one undergraduate student to assist me with the project ($2,500 USD).  **No funds will be used for a personal stipend for myself**.</p><p>Upon arrival, I will purchase the materials for the housing
setups for the project- twenty 10-gallon glass tanks, with lids; two metal
shelving units, and fluorescent lighting. These materials have already been
sourced from local businesses in Los Baños. 
The permanent enclosures will contain a facsimile of natural habitats,
including plants, substrate, and artificial misting system to simulate natural
rain cycles.  The animals will be fed
daily with appropriate sized prey items supplemented with veterinary-grade
calcium and vitamin powder.  Every animal
will be measured and weighed weekly, and growth data will be recorded.  After an acclimation period, the frogs will
by “cycled” to breed utilizing artificial manipulation of temperature and
humidity to create conditions similar to the rainy season; this method is used
by zoos and conservation centers around the world and is highly effective in
inducing breeding behavior in many species of frogs.</p>
<p>Very few additional costs will be incurred
for the field trips to collect the animals, as I already own much of the field
equipment needed for collection of the animals, such as thermometers and
hygrometers, as well as a GPS unit to record the location of the collection
sites.  As I have already secured the
source of necessary materials for my project, I should have the facility set up
by the end of August, 2015.</p>
<p>After
the facility setup, I will conduct field work throughout the month of September
2015 with interested students to locate the target species.  The collected individuals will be housed
separately in plastic terraria in a quarantine area for one month; during that
time they will be tested for the presence of Chytrid.
Animals that test positive for Chytrid will be treated using an antifungal.  Once all animals are
clear of Chytrid, they will be moved into the permanent enclosures in October
2015, and breeding attempts will begin.</p>
<p>I am confident that with your help, this pilot project will be a success; after this initial phase, plans will be made to expand it to other species of endangered Philippine amphibians. During this project, I will be training undergraduate and graduate students at UPLB on the proper methods of the long-term maintenance of this ex-situ project, so that it will be successfully transferred to UPLB staff and students upon the completion of my Fulbright award.<br/>

</div></div>","We are looking for help to bring innovative tried and tested water harvesting techniques to the attention of more small scale subsistence farmers and community leaders in Zimbabwe.  Mr Zephaniah Phiri is a recognised pioneer of keeping water in the landscape. Despite living in a very dry region of Zimbabwe he is able to grow a diversity of crops even in times of drought.  Unreliable rainfall patterns can destroy the livelihoods of small-scale farmers across the country.  Mr Phiri is a charismatic teacher and thousands have people have visited his farm since he started developing his unique techniques in the 1960's.  But for many this is not possible as he lives in a remote part of Zimbabwe.  We plan to set up a demonstration water harvesting plot at Kufunda Learning Village just outside Harare, the capital city of Zimbabwe.  We will invite Mr Phiri to teach young leaders on Kufunda's Environmental Leadership Programme - and they will carry out the practical work to build the plot and learn how to manage it.  In the future visitors to Kufunda will be able to learn about Mr Phiri's techniques and get inspiration from his life-long work through seeing them in practice.Kufunda Learning Village is visited by well over 500 people every year to take part in a range of activities.  Most of these visitors are involved in some form of community development, so they are ideal candidates for spreading awareness far and wide.  In one week this March there were nearly 200 people visiting us!  So our demonstration plot will bring Mr Phiri's sustainable ideas to so many more people. What we need:Yes, we need money!  To be precise we need 4500 US Dollars to make our vision come true.  This will pay for:

Two members of Kufunda Learning Village to spend one week with Mr Phiri, learning his techniques first hand on his farm.  


Mr Phiri to spend one week at Kufunda to inspire 23 young leaders aged 18-35 during the six-month 'Communiversity' Programme.  Each year Kufunda hosts 20 + young people through a leadership apprentice programme for sustainable community.


Members of Muonde Trust to accompany Mr Phiri to help with the practical training necessary to establish the demonstration plot. This includes mapping out the site and digging Phiri pits, contour ridges and ponds.  Muonde Trust was established in 2014 and works with Mr. Phiri to train and inspire dozens
of local farmer leaders, mostly women, to transform agricultural practices in their home area of Mazvihwa and beyond

IDEA</b><br/>Young people are interested in my project. We share the
following concern: How is our Earth, our food, our water doing now?
With these young people, I watched a variety of ""Earthships"" videos
and they have caused me to become hooked. Earthships are houses that
were built with recycled materials, among other things, with walls
made of tires.</p>
<p>So,
I traded my car for an old school bus that has been painted by an
artist in Sarchi. Thus, the idea of ​​SUSTANTABLE BUS (Facebook)
was born.</p>
<p><b>SUSTANTABLE
BUS</b><br/>The idea is to supply the bus with alternative energy
sources and as its garden the  plantation of organic vegetables. For
the furnishings, pallets are used. I have spoken with the INA
(National Institute of Learning) and with the ICT (Tourism Institute
of Costa Rica) and both agreed to my idea. And the project will
start at just the right time.</p>
<p></p><p><b>ORGANIC CULTIVATION</b></p><div>
<p>Montes de Oro is known especially for its mining history. But very slowly, the region is also becoming known for its products. Arrancibia delivers good coffee, El Bueyerito. From Laguna, we get dairy products which are sold to the government. Nevertheless, much is lacking and unemployment is extremely high.</p>
<p>I spent nearly 20 years in Tajo Alto where there is nothing but one hotel. But every one of my neighbors has a finca with good soil, so why should they not use this and farm organically? We can create a Cooperative and sell our products to hotels and restaurants. Vegan food is becoming more popular and Monsanto is a household name. In Montes de Oro, Monsanto was strictly denied entrance.<br/>I decided to create a workshop for which I needed 15 signatures and got 22. Each of the participating families has registered in Tajo Alto. This list was passed to the INA and they will contact us as soon as a date for our course is determined. This course will turn the Sustentable BUS into a bungalow and instead of being decorated with flowers, it will have a vegetable garden.The neighbors learn how and when it can be applied at home. I find it amazing how enthusiastic the people are with this, both women and men, young and old.<br/>We are not just talking about farming, but also about compost and biogas, which is made of compost and cow dung. As we know, there are plenty of cows.</p>
<p><b>THE WATER</b><br/>Montes de Oro has got a huge water problem, and the mayor will not distribute the water properly. The Bellavista Mine has also been operating in the main sources of water. (Montes de Oro Sustentable - Facebook) Tajo Alto has a separate water pipe. We have good pressure and good water. This will change from January 2016, and people in Tajo Alto should be prepared.<br/>The SUSTANTABLE BUS comes back into play. Two weeks ago, INA was here and gave us tips on how we can collect rainwater. For that we need for the bus a 5x5x2 meter tank, water pipes, a pump and an ozonator. This initiative will begin to benefit people during the rainy season and the neighbors are invited to see how this is done. They can learn how to install and maintain their water reservoir.<br/><br/><br/><b>THE TOILET</b><br/>Even the toilet should be considered. It is really bad how large the toilet tanks are here in Costa Rica; so much water is wasted. The toilet manufacturers, in my view, are great accomplices in wasting water. My idea is that washing hands fills the tank, the water then runs into the waste water,which in turn can be used for organic farming.</p>
</div><br/><p><b>THE
POWER</b><br/>The
bus will be equipped with a solar
system, a system that also supplies power, not only hot water. On the
FERIA DE CLIMA in Atenas I spoke with
a manufacturer who offered me a system for the bus: An electrical
outlet to provide power for a cooker and a fan. The system is offered
for $ 1,600, only electricity, no hot water.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>THE
MISSION</b><br/>This
project will show students that it is not necessary to cut trees in
order to obtain electricity, gas and in the future probably also
water, at a very high cost to our environment. Mother Earth will no
longer be looted, as she now is: cement, stone, sand. They will learn
that you can re-utilize already existing materials
such as buses and containers, and that one can grow food in order to
eat healthy. <br/><br/><b>THE
VISION</b><br/>The
vision is to build in the future with existing materials and take
advantage of the energy that Mother Nature provides- implemented
using innovative techniques.<br/><br/>I
would be very appreciative of a response from you, </p>

outlet to provide power for a cooker and a fan. The system is offered
for $ 1,600, only electricity, no hot water.THE
MISSIONThis
project will show students that it is not necessary to cut trees in
order to obtain electricity, gas and in the future probably also
water, at a very high cost to our environment. Mother Earth will no
longer be looted, as she now is: cement, stone, sand. They will learn
that you can re-utilize already existing materials
such as buses and containers, and that one can grow food in order to
eat healthy. THE
VISIONThe
vision is to build in the future with existing materials and take
advantage of the energy that Mother Nature provides- implemented
using innovative techniques.I
would be very appreciative of a response from you, 
With
best regardsYours
sincerely,Ulrike

Fundación Entropika was
established in 2007 by a group of dedicated conservationists, from varying
backgrounds, based in Amacayacu National Park in the Southern Colombian Amazon.
Entropika aims at contributing to the long-term
conservation of tropical biodiversity by facilitating community-led projects,
establishing programmes of education and research whilst working closely with local indigenous people to tackle conservation issues. Our approach
encourages interdisciplinary cooperation regarding the management of
biodiversity components, including <i>in-situ</i>
conservation, community-based research, environmental policies revision and
enforcement, improvement of indigenous living standards, and the feasibility
analyses of sustainable economic alternatives.<br/>

  Their vulnerability has led to the loss of its parents and its habitat. <i>Musmuki</i>
  is the silent hero of this story.</p>
<p>·<span> 
  </span>Night monkeys, or owl monkeys, are called “<i>Musmuki</i>” by local people in the forests
  of Peru.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><i>Musmuki</i>’s
scientific name is <i>Aotus</i>, which in
Latin it means “without ears”, because their ears are very small.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Night monkeys, or <i>Musmuki</i>s, are also called owl monkeys because of their similarity
with owls in the shape of the face and size of the eyes.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><i>Aotus </i>are the
only nocturnal monkey in the new world.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><i>Musmukis</i> have
disproportionately large brown eyes which have evolved as an adaptation to
their nocturnal lifestyle.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>In captivity, night monkeys are monogamous
animals; which means they have only one couple mate for a lifetime. In the
wild, they separate regularly.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Night monkeys are found from Panama to
Argentina. They can live in a wide variety of forest types and elevations that
range from sea level to 3.200m.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><i>Musmukis</i> are
arboreal animals, so they spend their life in the trees.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><i>Musmukis</i> live in
groups from 2 to 5 individuals; one adult of each sex and their children. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Adult <i>Musmuki</i>
males carry their children because they are stronger and are able to escape
predators more easily, while the female is weaker because it is lactating and
spending a lot of energy feeding the offspring. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Adult <i>Musmuki</i>
males transfer food to children more often that the females.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>In the Amazonian border between Colombian
and Peru there are two types (species) of night monkeys: the <i>Aotus nancymaae</i> or <i>Musmuki</i> (Nancy Ma’s Night Monkey) and the <i>Aotus vociferans</i> or Buri-buri (Spix's Night Monkey).</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>The latest assessment of the International
Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), upgraded the <i>Musmuki</i>’s conservation status from Least Concern (LC) to Vulnerable
(VU) owing to increasing threats for these monkeys, such as their extraction
for being used in malaria research and the loss of their habitat. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><i>Musmukis</i> are one
of the few monkey species that are affected by malaria, making them useful as
non-human primate experimental models in malaria research.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>In Peru, <i>Musmukis</i> are reproduced in captivity for malaria research. Sadly,
in Colombia, <i>Musmukis</i> are captured
from the wild for this purpose.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Advanced research in malaria stopped using <i>Musmukis</i> for experimentation, as current
vaccines are tested on humans. </p>

· When
capturing <i>Musmukis</i> for malaria
research, local trappers have to cut down in average 15m of forest around the
nest where the <i>Musmukis</i> live. The
trapping methods are hence affecting their environment, increasing
deforestation of the fragile Amazon rainforest.</div>

<p>It is the largest monkey in the New World. It has a woolly coat and a courageous
walk. In this videogame, Churuco is <i>Musmuki</i>’s
best friend.</p>
<ul>
<li>Woolly monkeys are called “Churucos” by
    local people in the Amazon forest in Colombia. </li>
<li>Woolly monkey’s scientific name is <i>Lagothrix lagothricha</i>, which relates to
    its fur; they have beautiful hair like a soft toy.</li>
<li>Churucos have a prehensile tail, meaning
    they can use their tail for grabbing. The tail has a soft skin in the top, like
    the skin of their hands, and acts as a powerful
    fifth limb.<b></b>
</li>
<li>Churucos can hang from their tail and
    remain suspended while looking for food or eating fruits in canopy branches.</li>
<li>Churucos
    can only live in primary and well-preserved forests. So they live in the dense
    Amazon forests of Colombia, Brazil, Ecuador and Peru.</li>
<li>Churucos
    are one of the largest monkeys in South America; their average weight is 9 kg.
    For this reason, they are hunted (mainly by indigenous people) for their meat.</li>
<li>Churucos are mainly frugivorous, meaning
    they prefer to eat fruits.</li>
<li>Churucos live in groups that range from 9
    to more than 30 individuals. The groups are composed of several males and
    females from different ages.</li>
<li>Churucos are very social and kind animals.
    They are very patient with their children and several females and males can take
    care of the same offspring.</li>
<li>Females breastfeed for approximately 20
    months and their birth interval ranges from 18 to 24 months.</li>
<li>Churucos are very susceptible to hunting;
    even at a small scale hunting can drive populations to extinction.</li>
<li>When hunters target females that are
    pregnant or with an offspring to be sold in the pet trade, they are drastically
    affecting their population recovery.</li>
<li>Churucos are effective seed dispersers, for
    this reason, the decrease of their populations will affect forest structure.</li>
<li>The
    latest assessment of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature
    (IUCN) upgraded the Churuco’s conservation status from Vulnerable (VU) to
    Endangered (EN). Their main threats are: hunting for the bush meat and pet trade
    markets, habitat loss and forest degradation.</li>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p>During our census fieldwork work we realized that there is an
international trade of night monkeys for biomedical research. These are sourced
illegally from Peru and Brazil to Colombia. So, in 2008 we started an
investigation that quantified this trade and their wild populations.</p>
<p>Our results suggest that <i>Aotus vociferans</i>,
which is widely distributed in Colombia, was not found in the Colombian side of
the Amazon River anymore. This, because of being overharvested for its use in
malaria research. In addition, the species <i>Aotus
nancymaae</i>, whose natural distribution has been described to be in Peru and
Brazil, is now found in Colombia.</p>
<p>Recent studies demonstrate that there is an endemic population of this
species in Colombia with a very small distribution. And there is another
population whose origins come from the releases of the animals captured in
Peru, used in Colombia for malaria research and then released back into the
wild in Colombia, for almost 40 years.</p>
<p>In order to stop this trade we filed a popular benefit law suit against
the biomedical laboratory, the Colombian Ministry of Environment and the
regional environmental authority from the Amazon. In 2014, we won the law case. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">This set a historical precedent in Colombia regarding the sustainable
use of biodiversity and the enforcement of environmental law.</span></p>
<p></p>
</div>
<div><p>The laboratory’s permit to capture wild
individuals of <i>Aotus vociferans</i> in
the Colombian Amazon was resumed as a result of an unconstitutional Court’s
ruling and they will continue releasing monkeys in areas where studies suggest
not to in order to preserve these species. Therefore, we urgently need to
continue research and the follow-up of our legal actions.</p></div>

<p><b>DONATE A BIOSAND FILTER - FUNDACIÓN ENTROPIKA!</b></p>
Biosand filters: Since January 2014 we have installed biosand filtration systems for obtaining clean water in 80 households of the indigenous communities of Mocagua, Colombia, and Chinería, Peru, as well as 2 communitarian filtration systems in the communities of Mocagua and San Martín, Colombia, benefiting a total of approx. 1350 people. We also monitor communitarian and household filters in 11 other communities and supervise the installation of water systems in 3 communities, 2 schools, an orphanage and a retirement home. Biosand filters are cost-effective and have been used successfully in various parts of the world (e.g. Africa and Latin America). Studies assessing the effectiveness of the system found that between 88% and 100% of E. coli bacteria (causing, amongst others, diarrhoea) are removed by the filter (e.g. Baker et al., 2006), reducing on average by 44% cases of diarrhoea in the population. Furthermore, Liang et al. (2007) have determined that 88% of the filters installed in a community in Cambodia are still in use after 8 years of operation; demonstrating the feasibility and viability of this alternative in rural areas. One significant advantage of the filter is that it does not require any chemicals to function. Water processed by the filter is not ""potable"" in the scientific sense; however the filter significantly improves the quality of the water and, as such, health in general.<br/>

</div></div>","What is Save Musmuki?
Save Musmuki is an innovative enterprise that pursues sustainable funding for the Entrópika Foundation, a Colombian-based NGO dedicated to the protection of tropical biodiversity in the Amazon Forest.
With your contributions, we will develop a product that will be sold and generate permanent income for the organization. The product is a
videogame themed around the problem of illegal trafficking of wildlife in the
Amazon forest, focusing on the special case of the Musmuki night monkeys, illegally traded for biomedical research.
The main goal is to permanently raise funds but also to educate players in conservation issues and the importance of biodiversity in the Amazon Forest, bringing awareness on these issues.
20% of contributions of this campaign will directly go to Entropika Foundation, specifically
to help them fight the trafficking of wildlife while improving indigenous livelihoods.
Once developed and commercialized, 25% of the
income generated by the videogame will directly go to Fundación Entropika.
In order to keep contributors informed at all times, BOPIN
Games will periodically publish information on the advances in the development
of the game.

Our mission is to design videogames that act as
interaction mechanisms between the ecosystem and the wider public by
strengthening awareness on conservation issues and teaching to care for the
planet’s biodiversity.
Make this dream possible! Help the Musmuki find his parents! and become an
active part of the solution!
Your feedback is always welcome!

Watch the demo of the videogame, it's looking pretty cool so far!





Fundación Entropika was
established in 2007 by a group of dedicated conservationists, from varying
backgrounds, based in Amacayacu National Park in the Southern Colombian Amazon.
Entropika aims at contributing to the long-term
conservation of tropical biodiversity by facilitating community-led projects,
establishing programmes of education and research whilst working closely with local indigenous people to tackle conservation issues. Our approach
encourages interdisciplinary cooperation regarding the management of
biodiversity components, including in-situ
conservation, community-based research, environmental policies revision and
enforcement, improvement of indigenous living standards, and the feasibility
analyses of sustainable economic alternatives.

This species is being illegally traded in the Colombian-Peruvian Amazon.
  Their vulnerability has led to the loss of its parents and its habitat. Musmuki
  is the silent hero of this story.
· 
  Night monkeys, or owl monkeys, are called “Musmuki” by local people in the forests
  of Peru.
· 
Musmuki’s
scientific name is Aotus, which in
Latin it means “without ears”, because their ears are very small.
· 
Night monkeys, or Musmukis, are also called owl monkeys because of their similarity
with owls in the shape of the face and size of the eyes.
· 
Aotus are the
only nocturnal monkey in the new world.
· 
Musmukis have
disproportionately large brown eyes which have evolved as an adaptation to
their nocturnal lifestyle.
· 
In captivity, night monkeys are monogamous
animals; which means they have only one couple mate for a lifetime. In the
wild, they separate regularly.
· 
Night monkeys are found from Panama to
Argentina. They can live in a wide variety of forest types and elevations that
range from sea level to 3.200m.
· 
Musmukis are
arboreal animals, so they spend their life in the trees.
· 
Musmukis live in
groups from 2 to 5 individuals; one adult of each sex and their children. 
· 
Adult Musmuki
males carry their children because they are stronger and are able to escape
predators more easily, while the female is weaker because it is lactating and
spending a lot of energy feeding the offspring. 
· 
Adult Musmuki
males transfer food to children more often that the females.
· 
In the Amazonian border between Colombian
and Peru there are two types (species) of night monkeys: the Aotus nancymaae or Musmuki (Nancy Ma’s Night Monkey) and the Aotus vociferans or Buri-buri (Spix's Night Monkey).
· 
The latest assessment of the International
Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), upgraded the Musmuki’s conservation status from Least Concern (LC) to Vulnerable
(VU) owing to increasing threats for these monkeys, such as their extraction
for being used in malaria research and the loss of their habitat. 
· 
Musmukis are one
of the few monkey species that are affected by malaria, making them useful as
non-human primate experimental models in malaria research.
· 
In Peru, Musmukis are reproduced in captivity for malaria research. Sadly,
in Colombia, Musmukis are captured
from the wild for this purpose.
· 
Advanced research in malaria stopped using Musmukis for experimentation, as current
vaccines are tested on humans. 

· When
capturing Musmukis for malaria
research, local trappers have to cut down in average 15m of forest around the
nest where the Musmukis live. The
trapping methods are hence affecting their environment, increasing
deforestation of the fragile Amazon rainforest.




It is the largest monkey in the New World. It has a woolly coat and a courageous
walk. In this videogame, Churuco is Musmuki’s
best friend.

Woolly monkeys are called “Churucos” by
    local people in the Amazon forest in Colombia. 
Woolly monkey’s scientific name is Lagothrix lagothricha, which relates to
    its fur; they have beautiful hair like a soft toy.
Churucos have a prehensile tail, meaning
    they can use their tail for grabbing. The tail has a soft skin in the top, like
    the skin of their hands, and acts as a powerful
    fifth limb.

Churucos can hang from their tail and
    remain suspended while looking for food or eating fruits in canopy branches.
Churucos
    can only live in primary and well-preserved forests. So they live in the dense
    Amazon forests of Colombia, Brazil, Ecuador and Peru.
Churucos
    are one of the largest monkeys in South America; their average weight is 9 kg.
    For this reason, they are hunted (mainly by indigenous people) for their meat.
Churucos are mainly frugivorous, meaning
    they prefer to eat fruits.
Churucos live in groups that range from 9
    to more than 30 individuals. The groups are composed of several males and
    females from different ages.
Churucos are very social and kind animals.
    They are very patient with their children and several females and males can take
    care of the same offspring.
Females breastfeed for approximately 20
    months and their birth interval ranges from 18 to 24 months.
Churucos are very susceptible to hunting;
    even at a small scale hunting can drive populations to extinction.
When hunters target females that are
    pregnant or with an offspring to be sold in the pet trade, they are drastically
    affecting their population recovery.
Churucos are effective seed dispersers, for
    this reason, the decrease of their populations will affect forest structure.
The
    latest assessment of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature
    (IUCN) upgraded the Churuco’s conservation status from Vulnerable (VU) to
    Endangered (EN). Their main threats are: hunting for the bush meat and pet trade
    markets, habitat loss and forest degradation.






WHITE COAT CRIMINALS 

Laboratory scientists, advocates of animal exploitation and illegal
trafficking of wildlife, who never hesitate to snatch their prey from the
forest.



SMUGGLERS 

They hunt and later sell animals in danger of extinction. The
indiscriminate cutting down of Amazonian forest is also present on their
extensive criminal record. 



COLONISTS 
Accomplices in the illegal trafficking of wildlife. Destructive and ruthless people, they are capable of anything for money.



ANACONDA 
A constrictor snake that hungrily squeezes its prey. It immerses itself
in the great waters of the Amazon to remain unnoticed.

PIRANHA 

They are known for their sharp teeth, powerful jaws, and voracious
appetite for meat. With an acute sense of smell, they collectively attack its
prey.



BLACK CAIMAN
The black caiman of the Amazon rainforest is often mistaken for an
alligator, which it closely resembles. However, true alligators only live in
two places in the world, and neither is a rainforest environment: the
Southeastern US and the Yangtze River in China. 
Like all crocodilians, caimans eat a variety of fish, amphibians,
turtles, birds and mammals—whatever creature happens to be unlucky enough to
wander near them.

MARGAY 

Like most felines, it is solitary and nocturnal, with fiery eyes and
intoxicating essence in its roar. As a carnivore, it hides in the shadows.



HARPY EAGLE 

It is the largest and most powerful raptor found in the Americas, and
among the largest extant species of eagles in the world. They are known to prey on monkeys
and other mid-sized arboreal mammals.






ENVIRONMENTAL POLICE 


Specialized Corps of the Police that support the community in defending
and protecting the environment.



PINK DOLPHIN 


The world's largest river dolphin. Its characteristics
give it great manoeuvrability so it can navigate the flooded forest. Naturally
intelligent, legend says that it held humanity in its core, but the gods envied
it and decided to transform it from human to animal.



SCARLET MACAW 
Popular in the jungle for its friendly behavior, it
is a multi-colored bird whose body expresses sublime powers of singing and flying.



SHAMAN 
The story goes that Yuche, who has always lived in
the world accompanied by Musmukis and
all fauna and flora of the universe, saw the earth age, gaining extensive
knowledge of his environment and sacred rituals to understand it.

AOTUS
PROJECT – FUNDACIÓN
ENTROPIKA 



During our census fieldwork work we realized that there is an
international trade of night monkeys for biomedical research. These are sourced
illegally from Peru and Brazil to Colombia. So, in 2008 we started an
investigation that quantified this trade and their wild populations.
Our results suggest that Aotus vociferans,
which is widely distributed in Colombia, was not found in the Colombian side of
the Amazon River anymore. This, because of being overharvested for its use in
malaria research. In addition, the species Aotus
nancymaae, whose natural distribution has been described to be in Peru and
Brazil, is now found in Colombia.
Recent studies demonstrate that there is an endemic population of this
species in Colombia with a very small distribution. And there is another
population whose origins come from the releases of the animals captured in
Peru, used in Colombia for malaria research and then released back into the
wild in Colombia, for almost 40 years.
In order to stop this trade we filed a popular benefit law suit against
the biomedical laboratory, the Colombian Ministry of Environment and the
regional environmental authority from the Amazon. In 2014, we won the law case. This set a historical precedent in Colombia regarding the sustainable
use of biodiversity and the enforcement of environmental law.


The laboratory’s permit to capture wild
individuals of Aotus vociferans in
the Colombian Amazon was resumed as a result of an unconstitutional Court’s
ruling and they will continue releasing monkeys in areas where studies suggest
not to in order to preserve these species. Therefore, we urgently need to
continue research and the follow-up of our legal actions.

thread in a circular manner, radiating out from the center of the base, in the
same way that the Arhuaco believe Serankwa created the earth.

DONATE A BIOSAND FILTER - FUNDACIÓN ENTROPIKA!
Biosand filters: Since January 2014 we have installed biosand filtration systems for obtaining clean water in 80 households of the indigenous communities of Mocagua, Colombia, and Chinería, Peru, as well as 2 communitarian filtration systems in the communities of Mocagua and San Martín, Colombia, benefiting a total of approx. 1350 people. We also monitor communitarian and household filters in 11 other communities and supervise the installation of water systems in 3 communities, 2 schools, an orphanage and a retirement home. Biosand filters are cost-effective and have been used successfully in various parts of the world (e.g. Africa and Latin America). Studies assessing the effectiveness of the system found that between 88% and 100% of E. coli bacteria (causing, amongst others, diarrhoea) are removed by the filter (e.g. Baker et al., 2006), reducing on average by 44% cases of diarrhoea in the population. Furthermore, Liang et al. (2007) have determined that 88% of the filters installed in a community in Cambodia are still in use after 8 years of operation; demonstrating the feasibility and viability of this alternative in rural areas. One significant advantage of the filter is that it does not require any chemicals to function. Water processed by the filter is not ""potable"" in the scientific sense; however the filter significantly improves the quality of the water and, as such, health in general.

<p>This campaign aims to raise funds to develop different sizes of Rapid Steamer that helps to have compact units suitable for households and for street vendors, small hotels etc. This would help to reduce the cost, save environment and to make programmes like mid day meal more feasible in developing or under developed countries. </p>
<p><b>Technology is already developed, tested and functional in many locations. Now the challenge is to design cooking systems for households, small hotels, street shops, etc.</b> Currently the system developed is only for big hotels and institutions where cooking for 500 + persons a day is happening. Through this campaign and contributions, we would be able to develop three different products and also to cater to all segments of the society. This would help to cut down carbon emission, save cost and also make cooking viable. </p>
<p>We are looking for developing $ 100000 to do Research &amp; Development and to introduce three models of Rapid Steamer. </p>

<p><b>1.<span> 
</span></b><b>What
is Rapid Steamer?</b></p>
<p>Rapid
Steamer is an eco-friendly steam-based cooking technology that can be used for
bulk cooking at the fuel consumption rate of just .60 cent per person using
coconut shell,  coconut husk or briquettes
of solid wastes (bio-fuels can also be used) . </p>
<p>Using
modest cooking techniques rapid steamer can cook hygienic and healthy food in a
short time (food for 500 individuals in 2 hours). It is developed domestically
and has been patented by the Government of India.</p>
<p><b>2.<span> 
</span></b><b>What
are the differences between rapid steamer and the steamers currently available
in the market, their advantages and disadvantages?</b></p>
<p>Two
types of steamers are available in the market. One which works on LPG and the
other using firewood or coconut shells. LPG-based steamers won't be as
economical. Even those steamers that use coconut shell or firewood would need
large quantity of the fuel because of continuous and open combustion, high
smoke emission and space constraints for storing fuel apart.</p>
<p>While,
Rapid Steamer uses less fuel in a closed combustion compartment and can retain
heat for a long time and also emits less smoke. Rapid Steamer is ideal for bulk
cooking that too in a short time, at low cost. Also, one can cook in Rapid
Steamer for just .60 cent per person. Apart from basic cooking, Rapid Steamer
is also available with other technologies which allows preparation of food items, beverages and so on. </p>
<p><b>3.<span> 
</span></b><b>Is
solar steamer technology available?</b></p>
<p>Steamers
which work on solar energy are available. Cost of ownership of solar steamers
that can prepare food for about 500 people would be rather expensive and can go
up to $ 8000 per steamer and will not be fuel efficient for all.</p>
<p><b>4.<span> 
</span></b><b>What
if firewood or coconut shells are not available?</b></p>
<p>Instead
of firewood and coconut shell briquettes of coconut husk, wood flour, bagasse,
shells of cashew nut, rubber seeds and other plant waste can be used as
alternative. Briquettes are available at very low cost in the market. Use of
these briquettes may not be economical in regular steamers.</p>
<p><b>5.<span> 
</span></b><b>What
are the fuel options that can produce large amount of heat?</b></p>
<p>Amount
of heat depends on the calorie value of available fuel options in the market.
For example, tamarind wood, coconut shells, coal and so on have a calorie value
of more than 5000 and therefore, it can generate a lot of heat even with less
fuel. If fuel options with less calorie value is used its quantity will have to
be increased.</p>
<p><b>6.<span> 
</span></b><b>Are
two hours enough to prepare food for 500 individuals at the rate of .60 cent
per person?</b></p>
<p>Yes,
this is achievable if Rapid Steamer worked in favorable conditions. Cooking on
Rapid Steamer once everything is ready will help us utilize the steam beneficially.
It takes only fifteen minutes to cook pulses such as green gram, black gram and
so on if they are soaked well otherwise it may take up to 30-40 minutes. Also,
it would take only 15 minutes to cook good quality rice and takes up to 30-40
minutes to cook low quality rice. Since we use different vessels to cook
simultaneously cooking gets done in 2 hours. If Rapid Steamer is used in the
ideal manner its expense will only come up to .60 cent per person. Several
government agencies and associations have approved Rapid Steamer.</p>
<p><b>7.<span> 
</span></b><b>What
is more effective, coconut shell or husk?</b></p>
<p>Coconut
shells are good for quick combustion. Water starts boiling when 50 coconut
shells are used and later husk, firewood and other such fuel alternatives can
be used. Compared to coconut shells, coconut husks are available at a lower
price. Once combustion starts coconut husk should be used.</p>
<p><b>8.<span> 
</span></b><b>What
is the technology used in Rapid Steamer? Is this an approved technology?</b></p>
<p>Using
natural air drafting technology Rapid Steamer can absorb air and this absorbed
air will help rotate the heat through a particular cabin. This is the
peculiarity of Rapid Steamer as this technology is not available in other
steamers. The product has been patented by the Government of India. Indian Institute of Technology- Mumbai
has verified this patented technology. Kudumbashree units of the Kerala Government
have tested Rapid Steamer. This evaluation and analysis of the Rapid Steamer
has proved that it can function at the mere cost of .60 cent per individual.
The Kerala State Education Department has set up the Rapid Steamer and it is working at just below .60 cent per person.
Many cooking related agencies such as Kerala Hotels and Restaurant Associations,
Kerala Auditorium Association and Kerala Catering Associations have also
testified this claim.</p>
<p><b>9.<span> 
</span></b><b>How
much smoke or ash is emitted by the Rapid Steamer?</b></p>
<p>Since
the Rapid Steamer needs only a small amount of fuel the amount of ash residue is
less. Excess ash falls into the tray which is placed below the cabin. The smoke
emitted as a result of combustion is released through the exhaust pipe.</p>
<p><b>10.<span>  </span></b><b>The rate of fuel consumption is at .60
cent per person in the Rapid Steamer. On what basis is this calculated?</b></p>
<p>For
preparing food for 500 individuals 500 coconut shells are used. One kilo coconut
shell would have 17 coconut shells. Therefore 500 coconut shells would be
around 29 kilos. 1 kilo coconut shell is available at 1/ 6<sup>th</sup> of a USD. Therefore, to prepare food for 500 individuals $ 4 would be spent which
means less than .60 cent an individual. One coconut husk costs only .40 cent
and if we used husk as fuel then the rate will go down further. So will it for other
briquettes.</p>
<p><b>11.<span>  </span></b><b>Can you cook in a Rapid Steamer for
50 individuals that is usually used to cook food for 500 individuals? What will
be the expense?</b></p>
<p>Yes,
it is possible. But to heat the boiler a particular amount of fuel is needed
which is equal to the fuel needed to cook food for 500 individuals. So, to
prepare food for 50 individuals it is better to use a Rapid Steamer of low
capacity.</p>
<p><b>12.<span>  </span></b><b>Is it safe to use Rapid Steamer? </b></p>
<p>Rapid
steamer does not come under the Boiler Act. If the steam exceeds 15 PSI it will
act just like a pressure cooker. To cook, steam of 10-15 PSI is enough. Like
other steamers, Rapid Steamer is built using iron of 6-8 mm thickness. The
vessels of Rapid Steamer have the capacity to withstand 35-40 PSI.</p>
<p><b>13.<span>  </span></b><b>How does a Rapid Steamer work?</b></p>
<p>Burn
coconut shell/firewood in the NAD ( Natural Air Drafting) chamber.Ensure that the boiler has enough
water. After 30 minutes steam is formed in the boiler. The steam thus formed
reaches different cooking vessels through the insulated pipe lines.</p>
<p>Facilities
are available for the opening and closing of the vessels.  Start cooking when the steam reaches 15 PSI
in the meter. If it exceeds 15 PSI it opens on its own and the heat is maintained.
If steam exceeds 15 PSI, do not use coconut shells or firewood and when it is
below 15 PSI use shells and firewood through the side chambers. Special PSI
meter is fixed on the steamer. Usually there will be steam in the steamer even
after cooking. We can release the steam if further cooking is not required.</p>
<p><b>14.<span>  </span></b><b>Is Rapid Steamer manufactured in a
fixed size?</b></p>
<p>Rapid
Steamer of different sizes and needs are available. Based on the requirements
of clients different boilers and cooking vessels are available. But we need to
do the R&amp;D for small units for households, small hotels etc and we are now
trying to develop such models. There are design challenges when the system is
becoming compact, R&amp;D has lot many challenges. </p>
<p><b>15.<span>  </span></b><b>What is the cost of a Rapid Steamer?What
are the specific instruments available, presently?</b></p>
<p>The
rate of the instruments range between $ 2000 to $ 8000. These are available for
various purposes. Among these steamers there are instruments for making
many food items. </p>
<p><b>16.<span>  </span></b><b>Is it healthier to cook food using
steam?</b></p>
<p>Steam
cooking is an old method. The micro elements, vitamins and all other proteins
remain in the food even after cooking. Also, it retains much of the taste and
colour of the food.Since cooking is done in 212 Fahrenheit the proteins and
other nutrients will remain in the food. Steam cooking preserves more nutrients
and is way healthier.</p>
<p><b>17.<span>  </span></b><b>Is coconut shell available in abundance?</b></p>
<p>In
Kerala, As of now only 30% of coconut trees are being used and in an area of
1.935 million hectares 12,833 million coconuts are being produced. If the
entire lot of husk and shells are used 3.8 billion gasoline will be produced. In
other words 14000 crore litres of petroleum is being consumed.  But if the whole husk and coconut shells are
used we can produce 380 crore litres of petroleum. This is the case with many
tropical areas, South East Asian Countries, Africa etc </p>
<p><b>18.<span>  </span></b><b>How eco-friendly is Rapid Steamer?</b></p>
<p>It
should always be such that the fuel used in Rapid Steamer is type of a bio
waste. Coal, firewood and such fuels should be avoided. This should bring down
the usage of LPG and other fossil fuels. Since Rapid Steamer uses coconut husk,
coconut shells and other low sulfur emitting materials it is an eco-friendly
instrument.</p>
<p><b>19.<span>  </span></b><b>What is the area required to
place a working Rapid Steamer? </b></p>
<p>Depending
on the size and number of steamers,the area varies from 100 sq. ft. to 500
sq.ft.</p>
<p><b>20.<span>  </span></b><b>What goes into the manufacturing of
a Rapid Steamer?</b></p>
<p>Both
the boiler and the NAD base of the Rapid Steamer are steel-based. Cooking units
are made in stainless steel.</p>
<p><b>21.<span>  </span></b><b>Can Rapid Steamer work on an ordinary
steamer?</b></p>
<p>Yes,
but it is not encouraged.</p>
<p><b>22.<span>  </span></b><b>For how long can the Rapid Steamer be
put to work in a day?</b></p>
<p>There
is no restrictions on the usage duration of the Rapid Steamer.</p>
<p><b>23.
What could be the possible reason if a Rapid Steamer stopped working for over a
month?</b></p>
<p>The
steamer should be cleaned out regularly and the water in the boiler should be
replaced.</p>
<p><b>23.<span>  </span></b><b>What are the after-sales services
offered to clients by Rapid Steamer?</b></p>
<p>In
case of any manufacturing defect, Paschim Biospace will offer free service for one year. From the very next
year Annual Maintenance Contract service will be available at 8% of the basic value of the machines.
Service assistants or executives will be present in every district to attend to
service needs.</p>
<p><b>24.<span>  </span></b><b>Are there any loans or subsidies available
for the purchase of Rapid Steamer?</b></p>
<p>Kudumbashree-
Govt of Kerala offers a 30-35% subsidy on the Rapid Steamer through many
schemes. Long-term loans too are available for purchases from the public sector
banks.</p>
<p><b>25.<span>  </span></b><b>Can the Rapid Steamer be moved from
its initial installation space to another without much hassle?</b></p>
<p>Of
course, you can move the steamer as per your requirements,but certain safety
precautions should be in place considering the weight of the steamer. </p>
<p><b>26.<span>  </span></b><b>Is there any insurance cover for the
Rapid Steamer?</b></p>
<p>Yes,
the National Insurance Company ( Govt of India) gives an insurance cover of $
20 per year.</p>
<p><b>27.<span>  </span></b><b>Can Rapid Steamer work on LPG?</b></p>
<p>Yes,
but it is optional and not encouraging the usage.</p>
<p><b>28.<span>  </span></b><b>What is the warranty period offered
by Rapid Steamer?</b></p>
<p>Rapid
steamer, as such is damage-proofed in its built and yet the company gives a
free warranty of up to a year.</p>
<p><b>29.<span>  </span></b><b>How many litres of water is used in a
Rapid Steamer (for 500 individuals)?</b></p>
<p>In
order to cook for 500 individuals, boiler with the capacity of 200 litres of water
is used and 100 litres of water is enough to serve 500 people.</p>
<p><b>30.<span>  </span></b><b>Is Rapid Steamer labour-intensive (for  500 individuals) ?</b></p>
<p>Rapid
Steamer is the antithesis of labour-intensive. All it takes is one person.</p>
<p><b>31.<span>  </span></b><b>Who owns Rapid Steamer?</b></p>
<p>Rapid
Steamer is owned by the India based Paschim Biospace Research  Parks (P) Ltd.</p>

</div></div>","Rapid Steamer is a revolutionary green bulk cooking system that will allow to save money, time and to make an impact in the environment while supporting the cause of feeding the poor.
By using Biomass fuels, Rapid Steamer reduces the fuel costs to a 60% and it will also allow you to cook food 60-70% faster.Using modest cooking techniques Rapid Steamer can cook healthy food hygienically in a short time (food for 500 individuals in 2 hours).Steam cooking is considered to be the healthiest way of cooking. The microelements, vitamins and proteins remain on the food after cooking while retaining food taste and color. It is developed domestically and has been patented by the Government of India.Biomass is a renewable source of fuel to produce energy. The term refers to organic matter derived from living, or recently living organisms such as plants or plant-based materials which are not used for food.Rapid Steamer supports the use of firewood, coconut shell briquettes.coconut husk, wood flour, bagasse, shells of cashew nut, rubber seeds and other plant waste can be used as alternative.
Nowadays, high fuel cost and dependency on LPG are major challenges faced on cooking industries as LPG increases the cost of food and those that rely on firewood or coal are prone to major health hazards and cause environmental damages.
There was no technology adaptation that was both eco-friendly, cost-effective and and that helped promote social causes. Until Now.  



Rapid Steamer uses less fuel in a closed combustion compartment and can retain heat for a long time and also emits less smoke. Rapid Steamer is ideal for bulk cooking that too in a short time, at low cost. Also, one can cook in Rapid Steamer for just .60 cent per person. Apart from basic cooking, Rapid Steamer is also available with other technologies which allows preparation of food items, beverages and so on. 

Rapid steamer is very easy to use.  Users should fill the chamber with the biomass fuel, close it while cook it to prevent smoke from spreading. When burning the biomass, the boiler will heat water and will generate steam with a minimum amount of water and fuel.  


Rapid Steam allows rapid air flow and will keep the heat inside the chamber for a long time.  The steam will be sent to many vessels and it will just start cooking!









Rapid Steamer is not only a technology, it’s an efficient weapon that fights for Social Causes.
Here are some ways in which Rapid Steamer will address some World Problems:
There are 1 million Schools in India that offer Mid Day Meal programs. With Rapid Steamer, the rate of cooking can be brought down to 50-60%, which will be 1/5th of the actual cost.



Rapid Steamer can increase the productivity and profitability of small hotels by saving huge costs of LPG while making the entire industry sustainable. 


In India, more than 50 Million people are engaged in Street Vending, and it’s carried out in an unhygienic way. Cleanliness of such units and hotels can be improved with Rapid Steamer. 

1000s of domestic kitchens across developing and underdeveloped countries are still depending on firewood and Rapid Steamer would make a huge difference in their lives. 

Press Report by The Hindu, the Prominent National News Paper


This campaign aims to raise funds to develop different sizes of Rapid Steamer that helps to have compact units suitable for households and for street vendors, small hotels etc. This would help to reduce the cost, save environment and to make programmes like mid day meal more feasible in developing or under developed countries. 
Technology is already developed, tested and functional in many locations. Now the challenge is to design cooking systems for households, small hotels, street shops, etc. Currently the system developed is only for big hotels and institutions where cooking for 500 + persons a day is happening. Through this campaign and contributions, we would be able to develop three different products and also to cater to all segments of the society. This would help to cut down carbon emission, save cost and also make cooking viable. 
We are looking for developing $ 100000 to do Research & Development and to introduce three models of Rapid Steamer. 



1. Household Model -that can help cooking a small household of 4 to 5 people using Biomass based Steam System and to completely avoid LPG based cooking fuels


2. Compact Mobile Street Kitchen – that can automate the complete cooking of a ordinary street shop- After use they can move away the system ( Biomass based)



3. Unit for Small Hotels- This system can help a hotel to make tea-coffee- rice- curry cooking- breakfast preparation etc


On developing the complete product ranges and implementation, we would be looking at reducing Carbon Emissions, Reducing the dependency over fossil based fuels, Promoting the use of sustainability by using biomass based fuels, cutting down the fuel cost to help bulk cooking as low as .60 cents per meal and making the programmes like Mid day meal cooking more viable - which is existing in developing and under developed countries. 
We will also be setting up Community Kitchen in some of the neglected poor areas as a model project. Parts of funding will be used for this cause.

1. 
What
is Rapid Steamer?
Rapid
Steamer is an eco-friendly steam-based cooking technology that can be used for
bulk cooking at the fuel consumption rate of just .60 cent per person using
coconut shell,  coconut husk or briquettes
of solid wastes (bio-fuels can also be used) . 
Using
modest cooking techniques rapid steamer can cook hygienic and healthy food in a
short time (food for 500 individuals in 2 hours). It is developed domestically
and has been patented by the Government of India.
2. 
What
are the differences between rapid steamer and the steamers currently available
in the market, their advantages and disadvantages?
Two
types of steamers are available in the market. One which works on LPG and the
other using firewood or coconut shells. LPG-based steamers won't be as
economical. Even those steamers that use coconut shell or firewood would need
large quantity of the fuel because of continuous and open combustion, high
smoke emission and space constraints for storing fuel apart.
While,
Rapid Steamer uses less fuel in a closed combustion compartment and can retain

cooking that too in a short time, at low cost. Also, one can cook in Rapid
Steamer for just .60 cent per person. Apart from basic cooking, Rapid Steamer
is also available with other technologies which allows preparation of food items, beverages and so on. 
3. 
Is
solar steamer technology available?
Steamers
which work on solar energy are available. Cost of ownership of solar steamers
that can prepare food for about 500 people would be rather expensive and can go
up to $ 8000 per steamer and will not be fuel efficient for all.
4. 
What
if firewood or coconut shells are not available?
Instead
of firewood and coconut shell briquettes of coconut husk, wood flour, bagasse,
shells of cashew nut, rubber seeds and other plant waste can be used as
alternative. Briquettes are available at very low cost in the market. Use of
these briquettes may not be economical in regular steamers.
5. 
What
are the fuel options that can produce large amount of heat?
Amount
of heat depends on the calorie value of available fuel options in the market.
For example, tamarind wood, coconut shells, coal and so on have a calorie value
of more than 5000 and therefore, it can generate a lot of heat even with less
fuel. If fuel options with less calorie value is used its quantity will have to
be increased.
6. 
Are
two hours enough to prepare food for 500 individuals at the rate of .60 cent
per person?
Yes,
this is achievable if Rapid Steamer worked in favorable conditions. Cooking on
Rapid Steamer once everything is ready will help us utilize the steam beneficially.
It takes only fifteen minutes to cook pulses such as green gram, black gram and
so on if they are soaked well otherwise it may take up to 30-40 minutes. Also,
it would take only 15 minutes to cook good quality rice and takes up to 30-40
minutes to cook low quality rice. Since we use different vessels to cook
simultaneously cooking gets done in 2 hours. If Rapid Steamer is used in the
ideal manner its expense will only come up to .60 cent per person. Several
government agencies and associations have approved Rapid Steamer.
7. 
What
is more effective, coconut shell or husk?
Coconut
shells are good for quick combustion. Water starts boiling when 50 coconut
shells are used and later husk, firewood and other such fuel alternatives can
be used. Compared to coconut shells, coconut husks are available at a lower
price. Once combustion starts coconut husk should be used.

The Kerala State Education Department has set up the Rapid Steamer and it is working at just below .60 cent per person.
Many cooking related agencies such as Kerala Hotels and Restaurant Associations,
Kerala Auditorium Association and Kerala Catering Associations have also
testified this claim.
9. 
How
much smoke or ash is emitted by the Rapid Steamer?
Since
the Rapid Steamer needs only a small amount of fuel the amount of ash residue is
less. Excess ash falls into the tray which is placed below the cabin. The smoke
emitted as a result of combustion is released through the exhaust pipe.
10.  The rate of fuel consumption is at .60
cent per person in the Rapid Steamer. On what basis is this calculated?
For
preparing food for 500 individuals 500 coconut shells are used. One kilo coconut
shell would have 17 coconut shells. Therefore 500 coconut shells would be
around 29 kilos. 1 kilo coconut shell is available at 1/ 6th of a USD. Therefore, to prepare food for 500 individuals $ 4 would be spent which
means less than .60 cent an individual. One coconut husk costs only .40 cent
and if we used husk as fuel then the rate will go down further. So will it for other
briquettes.
11.  Can you cook in a Rapid Steamer for
50 individuals that is usually used to cook food for 500 individuals? What will
be the expense?
Yes,
it is possible. But to heat the boiler a particular amount of fuel is needed
which is equal to the fuel needed to cook food for 500 individuals. So, to
prepare food for 50 individuals it is better to use a Rapid Steamer of low
capacity.
12.  Is it safe to use Rapid Steamer? 
Rapid
steamer does not come under the Boiler Act. If the steam exceeds 15 PSI it will
act just like a pressure cooker. To cook, steam of 10-15 PSI is enough. Like

water. After 30 minutes steam is formed in the boiler. The steam thus formed
reaches different cooking vessels through the insulated pipe lines.
Facilities
are available for the opening and closing of the vessels.  Start cooking when the steam reaches 15 PSI
in the meter. If it exceeds 15 PSI it opens on its own and the heat is maintained.
If steam exceeds 15 PSI, do not use coconut shells or firewood and when it is
below 15 PSI use shells and firewood through the side chambers. Special PSI
meter is fixed on the steamer. Usually there will be steam in the steamer even
after cooking. We can release the steam if further cooking is not required.
14.  Is Rapid Steamer manufactured in a
fixed size?
Rapid
Steamer of different sizes and needs are available. Based on the requirements
of clients different boilers and cooking vessels are available. But we need to
do the R&D for small units for households, small hotels etc and we are now
trying to develop such models. There are design challenges when the system is
becoming compact, R&D has lot many challenges. 
15.  What is the cost of a Rapid Steamer?What
are the specific instruments available, presently?
The
rate of the instruments range between $ 2000 to $ 8000. These are available for
various purposes. Among these steamers there are instruments for making
many food items. 
16.  Is it healthier to cook food using
steam?
Steam
cooking is an old method. The micro elements, vitamins and all other proteins
remain in the food even after cooking. Also, it retains much of the taste and
colour of the food.Since cooking is done in 212 Fahrenheit the proteins and
other nutrients will remain in the food. Steam cooking preserves more nutrients
and is way healthier.
17.  Is coconut shell available in abundance?
In
Kerala, As of now only 30% of coconut trees are being used and in an area of
1.935 million hectares 12,833 million coconuts are being produced. If the
entire lot of husk and shells are used 3.8 billion gasoline will be produced. In
other words 14000 crore litres of petroleum is being consumed.  But if the whole husk and coconut shells are
used we can produce 380 crore litres of petroleum. This is the case with many
tropical areas, South East Asian Countries, Africa etc 
18.  How eco-friendly is Rapid Steamer?
It
should always be such that the fuel used in Rapid Steamer is type of a bio
waste. Coal, firewood and such fuels should be avoided. This should bring down
the usage of LPG and other fossil fuels. Since Rapid Steamer uses coconut husk,
coconut shells and other low sulfur emitting materials it is an eco-friendly
instrument.
19.  What is the area required to
place a working Rapid Steamer? 
Depending
on the size and number of steamers,the area varies from 100 sq. ft. to 500
sq.ft.
20.  What goes into the manufacturing of
a Rapid Steamer?
Both
the boiler and the NAD base of the Rapid Steamer are steel-based. Cooking units
are made in stainless steel.
21.  Can Rapid Steamer work on an ordinary
steamer?
Yes,
but it is not encouraged.
22.  For how long can the Rapid Steamer be
put to work in a day?
There
is no restrictions on the usage duration of the Rapid Steamer.
23.
What could be the possible reason if a Rapid Steamer stopped working for over a
month?
The
steamer should be cleaned out regularly and the water in the boiler should be
replaced.
23.  What are the after-sales services
offered to clients by Rapid Steamer?
In
case of any manufacturing defect, Paschim Biospace will offer free service for one year. From the very next
year Annual Maintenance Contract service will be available at 8% of the basic value of the machines.
Service assistants or executives will be present in every district to attend to
service needs.
24.  Are there any loans or subsidies available
for the purchase of Rapid Steamer?
Kudumbashree-
Govt of Kerala offers a 30-35% subsidy on the Rapid Steamer through many
schemes. Long-term loans too are available for purchases from the public sector
banks.
25.  Can the Rapid Steamer be moved from
its initial installation space to another without much hassle?
Of
course, you can move the steamer as per your requirements,but certain safety
precautions should be in place considering the weight of the steamer.

<br/>
Hello my friends<br/>
My name is Michel and I'm surfing artist. My work as an artist is next to my
family the most important thing in my life and the ocean my greatest
inspiration.<br/>
SurfArt is a mixture of my oil paintings, Tikis, sketches, driftwoodpaintings and my
dudes. The Dudes are wall sculptures bring radical and stylish surfmaneuvers to the wall.<br/>
Each Dude (along with my images) are individual pieces, wherever they are seen
absolute eye-catcher.<br/>
So<br/>
I think that it`s time for art to take responsibility and face the major issues
much more. My art deals with nature for a long time and from now on I will
contribute with my art to protect it ..<br/>
<br/>
My biggest goal is to allow my daughters and their children a beautiful and
inspiring life in a healthy environment. I'm sure by now everyone knows how
sensitive systems our oceans and our climate are and how strong our survival
depends on them.<br/>
My SurfArt project supports 50% !!!! of each work of art sold to an ecologically
important project which the lucky buyers can choose from my website.<br/>
SurfArt works together with selected projects and all have one thing in common: save our oceans
and our climate.<br/>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
I want a website and an online gallery to reach as many people as possible. And
in the social networks in which I am already well connected I will spread my
vision ..<br/>
I will rent a beautiful studio to create a place where my creativity can unfold fully and I
have the necessary space to realize my big goals.<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Reasonable work materials are extremely important and essential for any artist.<br/>
But I also need canvas, paints, brushes, carvingknives and also a useful

<br/>
A professional photographer will bring my work into perspective and also the

graphic design studio.<br/>
<br/>

<p><b>The Project</b></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Ecuador has more species of plants per area unit than any other country in South America. 18% of the total discovered birds in the world, 1,655 birds, are found in Ecuador. The 382 mammal species that exist in this country, comprise 7% of the 5,490 species registered in the world. It is, in summary, a rich tropical region, with wetlands, due to its privileged geographic location in the Neotropics, which makes it form part of this privileged list of biodiversity.</span><br/></p>
<p>The National Park Cuyabeno is located in the
provinces of Napo und Sucumbíos, originally
encompassed an area of 603,380 hectares. Due to an increasing indigenous population and non sustainable practices more and more forest areas are being converted into agricultural lands. This in turn is causing a devastating effect on the fragile flora and fauna of the region. As the natural beauty of the area is attracting every year lots of tourists, more and more Tourist lodges get constructed within the reserve and indigenous communities in the vicinity are more and more making a living from the booming tourist industry which in turn effects their traditional way of living adversely.</p>
<p>This project is a demonstration project of sustainable living in the indigenous community of Puerto Bolivar. It consists of establishing a botanical garden whith over 100 endangered plant species  of the Amazonas. At the same time we will introduce viable sustainable tree crops to the surrounding indigenous communities like the breadfruit tree to reduce deforestation and habitat loss of plant and animal species. </p>

 Exclusive tire recycling, choose the most unique accessoriesWhat do you think if you see scrapped tire in a forest? Would You have any idea how to use it? Would You bring it at home ? Imagine how can You reuse it. I found a solution to solve this problem. We truly believe to have a fantastic project, where we can mix our creative side with the strong desire for fashionable stuff and our deep karmic calling to do something important for our planet and for the next generations who will inherit this world from us. Some month ago I found the most interesting environment friendly hobby in my life: recycling bike and car tires on the most exclusive way, doing belts and other accessories. So, I created a brand, which makes unique, unrepeatable, designed and personalized fashionable products.   Tires are by their very nature a recycling headache, they are difficult to break down and reuse and often just pile up becoming an eyesore and taking up valuable space, holding precious resources.  The abundance of trash is a tremendous problem for our planet, and we need make more room for ideas that help us get rid of it or those that transform the excess – instead of producing more and more.    UNDER PROCESS :) SELFIE TIME                       
                              ...after the cleaning process. starting to fix the buckles...  We prepare belts with bracelets and earrings, rings from inner tubes.    Creative colleagues are already involved to help my project, making even more belts, dog accessories, and thanks to the ingenuity, other good ideas like suspenders from inner tubes are already prepared by myself and our team. With my first collection, I went for a short business trip to Amsterdam, London and I already have my first partners there as well. I love to see the surprised faces when people realize that my beautiful belts are made from recycled tires.  We collect, cut, clean and paint the tires in South Hungary. I travel between Budapest, Amsterdam and London to visit local markets and shops to sell my handmade products.   Why I would like to raise money?By creating a crowdfunding project I hope to raise funds for the production and marketing as well and share this fantastic artistical and recycling project with the world.Because of the workflow, some machines should be bought for easy cutting and collecting,  moreover 2 employees should be applied to clean and collect the tires.  My First RESULTS  My tribe and the passion for recycling is just growing every day. And we recycle every day more and more tires. Our techniques and designes are always renewed and we always give you our best.     How TukTuk was bornI’ve been living in London until May, working in Marketing and graphic materials, but I get bored with the weather and felt the needing to change something in my life. I had a great friend who moved to Tanzania a couple of years ago, and he needed some help in his business. So, one day I just decided to move close to Kilimanjaro.                                                    Some weeks after my arrival, one day when I visited the market, found a lady selling beautiful and colorful painted slippers made from car and motor tires.                               I immediately fall in love with her products, I bought some pairs and started to show it to my friends.  I knew that my life has changed, I found a crazy strong interest and curiosity for tire recycling. I liked the idea to reuse  and create perfectly designed fashionable stuff.The tire recycling idea captivated be instantly, a stunning combination of beautiful items and a recycling solution to a persistent problem.   Coming back to Europe, to my hometown in Hungary, I already decided to follow the deep calling in my heart : I had my brand name (TukTuk Designer Tribe), my website, and next day after my arrival I immediately run in the first service to ask for some bike tires. From that moment I started to organize my hobby, my job, my passion and my dreams in the same project. And this plan is growing dynamically.                                The past 4 month I recycled almost 200 tires. It's such a big quantity already.My mother started to work with me, she is an artist, painting oil pictures, but she likes so much this idea, so she started to paint my belts artistically.                                        Recycling tires is not the most exclusive hobby and job, but it’s a really big fun. Not many women choose such a hard and dirty dream to manage, but I love to collect, cut and clean the tires, and do the other tasks until it becomes a fashionable item.    Founders of TukTuk TRIBE

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Seagulls is a true grassroots Social Enterprise, established by me (Cat) and Kate around Kate’s kitchen table back in 2001. A Social Enterprise addresses social problems with a commercial response, there are no share holders and all profit goes back into the business to help more people.</p>
<p>Neither of us had business experience but we were (and still are) passionate about the local and global environment and social justice.   Two things we were sure on: we wanted to raise awareness of recycling and reuse in Leeds and we wanted to create jobs, training and volunteering opportunities for ourselves and others. We have always held the belief that if we can do it (and we still are) then anyone can and this is the message we pass on daily to our staff and volunteers.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528832310/flfimyfnbrtd8p1w8aoj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Over the last 18 years we have grown organically into a thriving, colourful and friendly place. Paint and people are at the core of what we do. Since paint collections began we have diverted 900,000 litres of reusable paint away from landfill, provided employment for 18 people (90% having previously volunteered at Seagulls) and worked with over 500 volunteers.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528832412/kk4wr9nmx4cbun3awcfg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The volumes of paint we are collecting and reusing continues to grow. Last year we collected 375 tonnes of paint all together, that’s double the volume from seven years ago, and it keeps on growing. One thing we can be sure of; there will never be a shortage of unwanted, reusable paint!</p>
<p>We also run a community arts project: Seagulls Mosaic and have undertaken numerous community mosaic installations and our work can now been seen across the city. We have worked with over 1000 Leeds residents to make these projects happen and created meaningful and long lasting public art.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528836902/biofc6vprnohsj5hetxi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We have reached a pivotal point and have the confidence and capacity to expand Seagulls, making it bigger and better and essentially able to reach more people. With bigger volumes of paint, the need to diversify our income streams and with more people wanting to get involved we need to expand our floor space and build capacity.</p>
<p><strong>We have a vision</strong>, we have taken on additional space at Aire Place Mills and intend to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build a new paint reprocessing and storage area that will enable us to move the majority of the paint mixing out of the paint store</li>
<li>Improve the paint store</li>
<li>Build 2 workshops for screen printing, upcycling furniture and woodwork</li>
<li>Establish and build a plastic refill shop, starting with basic refills but looking to expand product range of reusable and environmentally friendly products</li>
<li>Create a social area for volunteers and staff to encourage engagement</li>
</ul>

<p>Most importantly we want to <strong>create more space to help more people</strong>. We know it sounds cheesy, but Seagulls is a place where people grow and build their confidence; learning life skills, teamwork and work experience. Our volunteer program <strong>We Grow People</strong> works and we want to do more of it.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>These are exciting and busy times for Seagulls. Increasing volumes of paint means we need to make sure we have resources to cope, this means more space and more manpower. We have taken on additional units in our yard and now need the funds to make the place function better and build our capacity.</p>
<p>The increasing volume of paint means 3 things: 1. we have more volunteer opportunities 2. We need to expand our paint store and paint mixing/ storage areas to meet the demand and 3. we need more people to buy our paint.</p>
<p>We want to adapt and kit out some of the new space for better changing rooms and an additional social area. Work at Seagulls is messy and physical so we need to look after our staff and volunteers. Seagulls is under pinned by team work and we need space to allow this to happen. To blow our own trumpet; we have an excellent track record in engaging with people, building their life skills, knowledge and confidence.</p>
<p>This year we have seen an increase in demand for our volunteering opportunities; primarily people living with mental health problems, ex offenders and young adults with learning disabilities. We offer bespoke support, training and work experience opportunities. We have the funds for an additional staff member to support this demand and we anticipate working with an additional 20 volunteers per year. Because of the increase in paint we have the capacity within the paint store and collections to keep all volunteers meaningfully occupied. It’s a win win situation if we can make the space work.</p>
<p>With an increase in people power we can introduce a Plastic Refill Shop. In the first phase we will offer 3 of the most popular liquid refills and look to expand the range as funds allow. This initiative will take some staff time but we also think it will open up good volunteering opportunities.</p>
<p>We also plan to separate the new space to accommodate 2 workshop studios; 1 for screen printing and the other as an upcycling workshop. Funds will pay for the design and structure of these. These spaces will be a way of bringing more income into the enterprise.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528834947/lto8p7tnqa9neejsmhfl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Because we are a Social Enterprise we aren't able to offer shares in the business; any profit we make goes back into Seagulls to work with more people and support our environmental work. We have however put together various perks and gifts when you donate; we are most in love with the enamel pin badges which are limited edition's for this campaign. We are also working to offer more perks as the campaign progresses. As well as a perk  you also get to bathe in a warm glow, knowing that you are helping a social enterprise reach more people and do more good work in the community.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Seagulls is a unique and off the wall business; we are passionate about finding ways to help the local and global environment whilst working with some of the most marginalised people in society. As one of my friends said ‘Seagulls is special and you are important to the fabric of Leeds, you’ve created a good thing where people know they have somewhere to go and feel valued and welcome, Seagulls gives people purpose and picks people up’.</p>
<p>Being part of Seagulls is like being part of a family. Because of our humble beginnings, we have created a place where people feel at ease almost straight away.</p>
<p>We work with a huge range of people, most living on the margins of society and disadvantaged for many different reasons; ex-offenders, young adults with learning disabilities, young people not in education or training, people living with often very serious mental health conditions. Many lack confidence, life skills and suffer extreme anxiety. Everyone at Seagulls is made to feel equal and part of the team. </p>
<p>As well as playing an important role within the community we also have a positive impact on the environment. To date:</p>
<ul>
<li>we have diverted and reused 900, 000 litres of paint away from landfill since 2005</li>
<li>people store an average of 17 tins per household</li>
<li>poorly disposed of paint poisons water sources</li>
<li>our paint brings colour to many homes and communities</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530221169/pbcgbd3gqrxrcrnytwbs.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>With the addition of a plastic refill shop our environmental impact on Leeds will increase significantly. Plastic is a huge problem and we know we are well placed to help Leeds achieve higher reuse and reduction rates:</p>
<ul>
<li>there are over 5 trillion bits of plastic floating in the sea</li>
<li>Plastic at sea breaks down into smaller and smaller bits contaminating sea- life</li>
<li>Plastic debris is eaten by around 50% of sea birds, 30% of turtles and 30% of fish in certain areas from where they can enter the food chain and be consumed by us</li>
<li>we can't filter the ocean, the only way to clean up this mess is to stop throwing plastic away</li>
</ul>
<p>Kate and I have been on one big learning curve, navigating the highs and lows of a social enterprise. At times we have wanted to run away, but our passion for Seagulls drives us forward and we are now part of the fabric of the city; working with a vast range of people, providing a valuable reuse service and cheap source of paint for Leeds residents.</p>
<p>In 2017 we won Social Enterprise of the Year Yorkshire and Humber and were shortlisted for UK Environmental Social Enterprise in 2016 and 17. We are the leading Third Sector paint reuse scheme in the UK.</p>
<p>In December 2017 we were given the best Christmas present ever, a 5-year contract with Leeds City Council for the collection and reprocessing of unwanted household paint. This has given us some hard fought stability and with it the opportunity to expand the enterprise. We are ready to grow and expand the enterprise.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528835650/b4iyzqcqbupr80rzmtfy.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are a well-established and respected Social Enterprise, we have a long track record and we know how to grow. We truly are passionate and proud that Seagulls manages to juggle a triple bottom line: Planet People Profit. We need to build momentum for our enterprise and ensure its stability for the next 20 years.  Through this campaign we are <strong>looking for support both monetary and time</strong>. We need help to ensure we get the building we need to expand and grow. </p>
<p>Like any other business, Seagulls has weathered many storms along the way, one of the biggest being The Boxing Day Foods in 2015. All of Seagulls was under water with some areas being over 1 metre deep. This was a particularly challenging time made better by people’s willingness to help. With people power we were operational within 2 weeks. The flood tested us on many different levels but we overcame the water and are stronger because of it.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528890924/mdvqedima0ilpcdhzu5e.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Investment will ensure our capacity to deliver our expansion. Our management team have been in place since conception and we have gained many layers of knowledge over the years. Our track record gives us confidence to move the enterprise forward. We want to build on the goodwill we have gained over the years and promote community ownership and engagement in Seagulls.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand there will be many out there who support what we do but can’t contribute financially. What we ask is you come and buy your paint from Seagulls,<strong> tell your friends </strong>about us and use our plastic refill shop, would you come to an upcycling workshop or use the screen printing facilities? Have you thought about trying out a mosaic workshop? <strong>Would you like to volunteer and help us on our journey?</strong> We are always looking for handy people and we will be in need of  people power to make the changes we have in mind.<strong> Time is as valuable as money </strong>and you will always be well fed at Seagulls (we provide a cooked lunch for staff and volunteers everyday).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535312731/cj2wdfzobsbjnjylgjay.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>So please share and spread the word, we are in need of money but we are also in need of people to help.</p>

To blow our own trumpet; we have an excellent track record in engaging with people, building their life skills, knowledge and confidence.
This year we have seen an increase in demand for our volunteering opportunities; primarily people living with mental health problems, ex offenders and young adults with learning disabilities. We offer bespoke support, training and work experience opportunities. We have the funds for an additional staff member to support this demand and we anticipate working with an additional 20 volunteers per year. Because of the increase in paint we have the capacity within the paint store and collections to keep all volunteers meaningfully occupied. It’s a win win situation if we can make the space work.
With an increase in people power we can introduce a Plastic Refill Shop. In the first phase we will offer 3 of the most popular liquid refills and look to expand the range as funds allow. This initiative will take some staff time but we also think it will open up good volunteering opportunities.
We also plan to separate the new space to accommodate 2 workshop studios; 1 for screen printing and the other as an upcycling workshop. Funds will pay for the design and structure of these. These spaces will be a way of bringing more income into the enterprise.


Because we are a Social Enterprise we aren't able to offer shares in the business; any profit we make goes back into Seagulls to work with more people and support our environmental work. We have however put together various perks and gifts when you donate; we are most in love with the enamel pin badges which are limited edition's for this campaign. We are also working to offer more perks as the campaign progresses. As well as a perk  you also get to bathe in a warm glow, knowing that you are helping a social enterprise reach more people and do more good work in the community.


The Impact
Seagulls is a unique and off the wall business; we are passionate about finding ways to help the local and global environment whilst working with some of the most marginalised people in society. As one of my friends said ‘Seagulls is special and you are important to the fabric of Leeds, you’ve created a good thing where people know they have somewhere to go and feel valued and welcome, Seagulls gives people purpose and picks people up’.
Being part of Seagulls is like being part of a family. Because of our humble beginnings, we have created a place where people feel at ease almost straight away.
We work with a huge range of people, most living on the margins of society and disadvantaged for many different reasons; ex-offenders, young adults with learning disabilities, young people not in education or training, people living with often very serious mental health conditions. Many lack confidence, life skills and suffer extreme anxiety. Everyone at Seagulls is made to feel equal and part of the team. 
As well as playing an important role within the community we also have a positive impact on the environment. To date:

we have diverted and reused 900, 000 litres of paint away from landfill since 2005
people store an average of 17 tins per household
poorly disposed of paint poisons water sources
our paint brings colour to many homes and communities


With the addition of a plastic refill shop our environmental impact on Leeds will increase significantly. Plastic is a huge problem and we know we are well placed to help Leeds achieve higher reuse and reduction rates:

there are over 5 trillion bits of plastic floating in the sea
Plastic at sea breaks down into smaller and smaller bits contaminating sea- life
Plastic debris is eaten by around 50% of sea birds, 30% of turtles and 30% of fish in certain areas from where they can enter the food chain and be consumed by us
we can't filter the ocean, the only way to clean up this mess is to stop throwing plastic away

Kate and I have been on one big learning curve, navigating the highs and lows of a social enterprise. At times we have wanted to run away, but our passion for Seagulls drives us forward and we are now part of the fabric of the city; working with a vast range of people, providing a valuable reuse service and cheap source of paint for Leeds residents.
In 2017 we won Social Enterprise of the Year Yorkshire and Humber and were shortlisted for UK Environmental Social Enterprise in 2016 and 17. We are the leading Third Sector paint reuse scheme in the UK.
In December 2017 we were given the best Christmas present ever, a 5-year contract with Leeds City Council for the collection and reprocessing of unwanted household paint. This has given us some hard fought stability and with it the opportunity to expand the enterprise. We are ready to grow and expand the enterprise.


Risks & Challenges
We are a well-established and respected Social Enterprise, we have a long track record and we know how to grow. We truly are passionate and proud that Seagulls manages to juggle a triple bottom line: Planet People Profit. We need to build momentum for our enterprise and ensure its stability for the next 20 years.  Through this campaign we are looking for support both monetary and time. We need help to ensure we get the building we need to expand and grow. 
Like any other business, Seagulls has weathered many storms along the way, one of the biggest being The Boxing Day Foods in 2015. All of Seagulls was under water with some areas being over 1 metre deep. This was a particularly challenging time made better by people’s willingness to help. With people power we were operational within 2 weeks. The flood tested us on many different levels but we overcame the water and are stronger because of it.

Investment will ensure our capacity to deliver our expansion. Our management team have been in place since conception and we have gained many layers of knowledge over the years. Our track record gives us confidence to move the enterprise forward. We want to build on the goodwill we have gained over the years and promote community ownership and engagement in Seagulls.

Other Ways You Can Help
We understand there will be many out there who support what we do but can’t contribute financially. What we ask is you come and buy your paint from Seagulls, tell your friends about us and use our plastic refill shop, would you come to an upcycling workshop or use the screen printing facilities? Have you thought about trying out a mosaic workshop? Would you like to volunteer and help us on our journey? We are always looking for handy people and we will be in need of  people power to make the changes we have in mind. Time is as valuable as money and you will always be well fed at Seagulls (we provide a cooked lunch for staff and volunteers everyday).

So please share and spread the word, we are in need of money but we are also in need of people to help.

So even though our untouched nature hasn't seen that many people, the pollution is wast and present.

<p>We will be organizing a clean up action and go to Tarej beach and clean it all up, with a help from you.</p>
<p>Our goal is to clean Tarej beach but more than that, we wish to educate people into Green-Way of life, recycling, Zero Waste life and reuse culture. It is important to show festival goers that we can have fun in the nature and not pollute it or leave massive amount of rubbish after all. The money will go into items, people and education. It's important to educate people and show them just how much festivals generate litter and waste material.</p>

<p>As keen scuba divers and having both worked within the non-for-profit and environmental sector for many years, we are passionate about the Ocean and appalled at the devastation being caused by plastic pollution.  Approximately 8 million pieces of plastic end up in our Oceans every day,  with 100,000 marine mammals &amp; turtles, and 1 million sea birds being killed annually by marine plastic pollution.  We are literally choking our planet to death.  </p>

<p>We want to be part of the solution to reverse that trend and we want you to be too!!  Just a few simple changes can help individuals and families to massively reduce their plastic consumption.  Our mission is to provide the means to help that to happen by providing healthy, nutritious organic wholefoods, household cleaning products and bathroom products which people can refill into their own containers.  Zero packaging waste and with people only taking what they need, less food waste too.  We'll also be filling our lovely wee store with loads of super cool products to help people on their journey to 'reduce, reuse, recycle', as well as being a creative hub which supports independent artists &amp; crafters who make fabulous handcrafted artifacts and gifts that fit right in with our plastic free, zero waste ethos.</p>

<h3>So, what do we need? What will you get? And what will we spend your cash on? </h3>
<p>In short, we need you!  We need your ideas, your feedback, your support...and, if you can manage it, some dosh to help us get set up would be absolutely amazing. Setting up this kind of enterprise properly is an extremely costly undertaking, because of the sheer amount of specialist equipment required and the number of different stock items. We are taking out a personal loan and using savings to fund the significant majority of this project.  But any additional support would be so very welcome.</p>

<li>Donations of £10:  A unisex vegan cord bracelet with a turtle charm OR a reuseable shark keyring and bottle opener, and voucher for 20% off your first shop with us.</li>
<li>Donations up to £25:  A scrummy argan and olive oil soap bar (handmade, cold pressed, vegan, cruelty free, nasties free), a jute soap bag which doubles up as an exfoliator, and a handmade fused glass soap dish, plus a voucher for 20% off your first shop with us.</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>So what is the impact that we hope the shop will have and that you will be supporting? </p>
<ol>
<li>As well as building a business for our wee family and for our fabulous artist in residence, the shop will be supporting approximately 35 - 40 independent artisans and craftspeople.  So your support will: help to build a network of independent British businesses, provide investment for a local community, provide jobs, support our British suppliers (we do not import any of our good from outside the UK although the source of origin for some products may be), help the growth of an independent High Street store, and help to support the local economy.</li>
<li>We see this venture not just as a commercial venture but also as community based initiative.  So we will be working with local environmental charities and community groups to support a sustainability revolution and encourage agents of social change.  We see our role not just as providing the means to effect behavioural change but as an educational resource to help people understand better the environmental and human impact that their spending decisions have.  By encouraging ethical consumerism and the principles of circular economy, we can collectively have an enormous impact on reducing and reversing the destructive environmental impact that is taking place at an alarming rate.</li>
<li>We have a robust Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental policy which will be embedded into all of our decision making.  We pride ourselves on only working with reputable suppliers who share our ethical values.  We ensure that our products are packaging free as far as possible (and where packaging is necessary that it is recyclable and plastic free), cruelty free, made from natural ingredients (where at all possible), fair trade, palm oil free, and where the country of origin is outside the UK that they are sourced from companies which are not involved in child labour and that embrace fair trade principles.  We try to keep our carbon footprint as low as possible by buying from British suppliers and sourcing as much as possible locally from independant businesses.</li>
<li>We will also be supporting our local food bank through a pay it forward scheme where our customers can add to their shop with a donation in kind, and we will add a further 25%.</li>
<li>We will be selling bags and containers that have been donated to us to be reused for those who forget their own or decide to buy more than they had anticipated, and any money raised from that will be donated to Lend with Care - a microfinance initiative which supports entrepreneurs in developing countries to recognise the comparative privilege that we enjoy here in the UK. </li>
<li>And of course by cutting down our packaging and food waste we will be supporting our planet and building a normative framework of ethical consumerism, which we hope will have a positive generational change.</li>

<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>We know that no business is without risk and this one is no exception.  Whilst we are at the forefront of the Zero Waste Revolution, which has made reusable and eco friendly products a trending market for 2019, we are by no means alone in our vision with several Zero Waste Stores a year cropping up across the UK.  That is why we feel it is important to establish ourselves quickly and fully into this emerging market.  Currently we have no direct competition within 30 miles as a bulk refill provider on a like for like basis (there are however fantastic offerings in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dundee).  There are a few shops within a 10 mile radius that stock similar products and have a commitment to eco friendly products and a handful of refill options, but none which do what we are aiming to do.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Wounded Nature – Working Veterans</strong> is unlike most other environmental and veterans oriented non-profits.  They are a remedial environmental organization that uses veterans and volunteers to remove debris and derelict boats from tidal marshes, rural coastlines and other hard to access areas on a year round basis.  They do not do token cleanups on Earth Day, World Ocean Day or other similar awareness holidays.</p>
<p><strong>Wounded Nature - Working Veterans</strong>  has removed more debris tonnage than all other environmental non-profits combined.  We venture into the hard to access barrier islands and tidal marshes where debris from past storms resides and has never been cleaned up.  We have always done so with a lack of the right equipment and funding.</p>
<p>  You can help us significantly increase our effectiveness by purchasing a supportive and cool t-shirt to help us buy the equipment we need.  Or you can have your name or the name of your business listed on the new aluminum work boats.  It is a great way to show everyone that you are helping us make a Real Coastal Difference.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to buy two customized aluminum workboats for use in removal of large pieces of treated wood and tires from the tidal marshes, In order to restore and revive our wildlife habitat.  We need two custom built aluminum boats and trailers with assorted equipment such as power winches, compressors (for air bags and tools), including expense for insurance and fuel.</p>
<p><strong>  Wounded Nature </strong>has a  goal to raise $440,000.  If we raise more money, we will use the funds for dumpster and disposal fees and to remove some abandoned boats.  If we raise less, we will buy the equipment we can afford based on the amount raised. </p>
<p>Our basic budget is:</p>
<p>Aluminum work boats w/double axle trailers:  $240,000</p>
<p>Boat special modifications:  $48,000</p>
<p>Motors:  $32,000</p>
<p>Motor cabling, steering, batteries and console:  $22,000</p>
<p>Tools, accessories, equipment for outfitting the boats:  $18,000</p>
<p>Operating costs including insurance, fuel, maintenance and overhead operating costs: $80,000</p>
<p>The Impact</p>
</div><div>
<p>You do not hear about the old treated wood, tires and other large debris problems because we are a remedial action group verses an advocacy organization.  We work on fixing the problem, rather than creating new laws that may be unnecessary or never get enforced.</p>
<p>  We get into the tidal marshes and areas behind the high tide line, where trash and storm debris get washed up.  These areas are where our coastal wildlife live and nest.</p>
<p>  Unfortunately, it’s the same area where treated wood from washed away docks, old tires and past storm debris reside.  Two things happen in these areas once they accumulate a lot of trash and debris that results in wildlife populations decreasing in our coastal areas.   First, rats and snakes move into these debris piles and start feeding on hatchlings.  The second is that the creosote and arsenic in old treated wood and petroleum chemicals from old tires leech into the water ways.  Young shrimp and baby fish are extremely sensitive to these chemicals.</p>
<p>  This debris is totally hidden since it is on the ground and pushed back behind marsh grasses and behind the coastal dunes.  So what looks like a pristine area by boat may well be a hidden debris field that is limiting wildlife and seafood populations from thriving.</p>
<p>  Wounded Nature  has 10 plus years of experience removing debris up and down the East Coast.  We do it year round.  On large cleanups our volunteers know the pain and yet feel the gain!  Dealing with insects, they get dirty, may obtain some minor cuts and scrapes, get cold and wet, but together we get the debris out and the job accomplished.</p>
<p> You can make a real coastal difference without having to get dirty, wet or cold - leave that to us.  </p>
<p>For $50, we will send you a ""Making a Real Coastal Difference"" t-shirt.  For $100, we will send you a sea turtle boat/beach/shopping bag plus a t-shirt.  For $500, we will place your name or the name of your business on Our Wounded Nature boat and send you a t-shirt. </p>

<h1>At a glance:</h1>
<p>A proposed new road
along the border of Peru’s Manu National Park, in the heart of the Amazon
rainforest, is an environmental disaster waiting to happen—a new road in this
region would open up vast tracts of pristine rainforest to illegal loggers, lead
to the loss of biodiversity and wildlife habitat, and increase greenhouse gas
emissions. </p>
<p>We want to conduct a
study to outline the negative consequences of this ill-conceived road and offer
policy-makers alternatives that are friendlier to local people and the
environment.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433539193/uixqzcn7cfknpfz8jlxc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The Manu Road cuts right through the jungle: the current road is shown in solid red, dashed red line is the proposed road extension.
</p><h2><b>The ‘Manu Road’ project: background</b></h2>
<p>Manu National Park is
the biodiversity gem in Peru’s network of protected areas—more species of
plants and animals can be found here than almost any other place on the planet.
Just a few hectares (1 ha=2.5 acres) of tropical rainforest in Manu, for example, contain more
species of tree than all of northern Europe. The Manu region is also a hotspot
for butterfly diversity: working at one site within the park and another in the
nearby Tambopata National Reserve, Peruvian researchers have identified over
1,500 species. Compare that to fewer than 800 butterflies in <i>all </i>of North America! </p>
<p>Historically, the Manu
region’s isolation has kept it relatively safe from the effects of illegal
logging, agriculture, gold mining, and rampant colonization that have
devastated other forested areas in Peru. The construction of the so-called
‘Manu Road,’ however, which began in the 1960s and which traverses the area
bordering the National Park, has vastly increased access to the region. The colonist population along the road and in adjacent areas has grown as a result, and with
the increased human population has come increased pressure on the region’s
natural resources. Conflicts with local indigenous groups, some of which still live
in voluntary isolation inside the rainforest, are also increasingly making
headlines as these people flee loggers and other intruders to their territories, as well as the disease and deforestation they often leave behind.</p>
<p>Now, economic interests
are pushing for further road construction and aim to extend the road to Boca
Manu, at the mouth of the Manu River and the entrance to the core area of the
National Park. If this happens, illegal loggers and a likely flood of new
colonists will gain access to immense areas of untouched rainforest and, if the
results of new road construction elsewhere in Amazonia—including along the
current length of the Manu Road itself—are any guide, a frenzy of deforestation
and resource extraction will continue to erode the biological integrity of the National Park. Together, the direct and indirect consequences of road
expansion in and around Manu may mean the beginning of the decline of the park
as the greatest reservoir of biodiversity the world has ever known. </p>
<h2><b>What will we do?</b></h2>
<p>Our goals are threefold:</p>
<p>1. We will write an
article aimed at scientists, conservationists, and Peruvian policy-makers that
will highlight the Manu Road and its negative environmental and social
consequences. </p>
<p>The article will begin
with a discussion of the history of the road’s construction to the present date,
as well as its proposed extension. We will summarize the negative impacts of
the road that have already occurred, and we will model potential future impacts
if the road is expanded. These impacts include land use changes (i.e.,
deforestation), the loss of biodiversity and wildlife habitat, and greenhouse
gas emissions from deforestation. We will end the article with a series of suggestions to achieve the stated goals of road expansion by other, more environmentally-friendly and cost-effective means. These might include increased investment in the local river transport network, or more money for schools and medical facilities.</p>
<p>2. Our Peruvian undergraduate
researcher, Gustavo Larrea Gallegos, will use data gathered from the field to
quantify the direct impacts of road construction using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
techniques. This analysis will form the backbone of Gustavo’s undergraduate
thesis.</p>
<p>3. Finally, we will conduct a
social media campaign designed to share our findings with the general public
within Peru and abroad, to spread awareness of this issue and the negative
consequences of road expansion, and to foster support for more
environmentally-friendly alternatives to new construction.</p>

</div></div>","At a glance:
A proposed new road
along the border of Peru’s Manu National Park, in the heart of the Amazon
rainforest, is an environmental disaster waiting to happen—a new road in this
region would open up vast tracts of pristine rainforest to illegal loggers, lead
to the loss of biodiversity and wildlife habitat, and increase greenhouse gas
emissions. 
We want to conduct a
study to outline the negative consequences of this ill-conceived road and offer
policy-makers alternatives that are friendlier to local people and the
environment.The Manu Road cuts right through the jungle: the current road is shown in solid red, dashed red line is the proposed road extension.
The ‘Manu Road’ project: background
Manu National Park is
the biodiversity gem in Peru’s network of protected areas—more species of
plants and animals can be found here than almost any other place on the planet.
Just a few hectares (1 ha=2.5 acres) of tropical rainforest in Manu, for example, contain more
species of tree than all of northern Europe. The Manu region is also a hotspot
for butterfly diversity: working at one site within the park and another in the
nearby Tambopata National Reserve, Peruvian researchers have identified over
1,500 species. Compare that to fewer than 800 butterflies in all of North America! 
Historically, the Manu
region’s isolation has kept it relatively safe from the effects of illegal
logging, agriculture, gold mining, and rampant colonization that have
devastated other forested areas in Peru. The construction of the so-called
‘Manu Road,’ however, which began in the 1960s and which traverses the area
bordering the National Park, has vastly increased access to the region. The colonist population along the road and in adjacent areas has grown as a result, and with
the increased human population has come increased pressure on the region’s
natural resources. Conflicts with local indigenous groups, some of which still live
in voluntary isolation inside the rainforest, are also increasingly making
headlines as these people flee loggers and other intruders to their territories, as well as the disease and deforestation they often leave behind.
Now, economic interests
are pushing for further road construction and aim to extend the road to Boca
Manu, at the mouth of the Manu River and the entrance to the core area of the
National Park. If this happens, illegal loggers and a likely flood of new
colonists will gain access to immense areas of untouched rainforest and, if the
results of new road construction elsewhere in Amazonia—including along the
current length of the Manu Road itself—are any guide, a frenzy of deforestation
and resource extraction will continue to erode the biological integrity of the National Park. Together, the direct and indirect consequences of road
expansion in and around Manu may mean the beginning of the decline of the park
as the greatest reservoir of biodiversity the world has ever known. 
What will we do?
Our goals are threefold:
1. We will write an
article aimed at scientists, conservationists, and Peruvian policy-makers that
will highlight the Manu Road and its negative environmental and social
consequences. 
The article will begin
with a discussion of the history of the road’s construction to the present date,
as well as its proposed extension. We will summarize the negative impacts of
the road that have already occurred, and we will model potential future impacts
if the road is expanded. These impacts include land use changes (i.e.,
deforestation), the loss of biodiversity and wildlife habitat, and greenhouse
gas emissions from deforestation. We will end the article with a series of suggestions to achieve the stated goals of road expansion by other, more environmentally-friendly and cost-effective means. These might include increased investment in the local river transport network, or more money for schools and medical facilities.
2. Our Peruvian undergraduate
researcher, Gustavo Larrea Gallegos, will use data gathered from the field to
quantify the direct impacts of road construction using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
techniques. This analysis will form the backbone of Gustavo’s undergraduate
thesis.
3. Finally, we will conduct a
social media campaign designed to share our findings with the general public
within Peru and abroad, to spread awareness of this issue and the negative
consequences of road expansion, and to foster support for more
environmentally-friendly alternatives to new construction.

What do we need?
We are not looking for salaries here. Instead, we only want to cover the costs of traveling to
the Manu study area from Lima to conduct interviews with local stakeholders and
to gather the data needed to assess the direct environmental impacts of road
construction.
Roughly US$3,000 will cover all
of our costs, a bargain considering the urgency of the issue and the impact our study will have. This amount
will cover all of the following:


$750—Domestic airfare
(Lima-Cusco) for our three team members


$600—Local transport in the Manu
area (transport here is slow and costly)


$700—Lodging and food


$310—Local guide, seven days


$440—Equipment (e.g., hand-held
GPS device) and misc. supplies (e.g., first-aid, rubber boots for rainforest
mud, etc.)

<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>It has been said that it is more dangerous to be a woman in
the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Republic of Congo than it is to be a
soldier. The threat of violence of both of a sexual and non-sexual nature is
constant, it is estimated that since the year 2000 over <b>2 million women have been raped in The DR Congo alone</b>.
The idea of women being inferior to men has always been embedded in the
indigenous social system of both countries and reemphasized through current
times. Women face many obstacles from birth and are often not allowed to access
to an education which continues the cycle of violence and prohibits women’s
growth in society and maintains the violent<i>
patriarchalcycle</i>.</p>
<p>Many times Congolese women are continued to be held back by
the misogynist teachings of society even if they leave their home country.
Women from both the Democratic Republic of Congo the Republic of Congo are in
need of empowered female role models to look up to and a historic opportunity
has presented itself and we need your support.</p>

</div></div>","A Snapshot of the Plight

             of Congolese Women



It has been said that it is more dangerous to be a woman in
the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Republic of Congo than it is to be a
soldier. The threat of violence of both of a sexual and non-sexual nature is
constant, it is estimated that since the year 2000 over 2 million women have been raped in The DR Congo alone.
The idea of women being inferior to men has always been embedded in the
indigenous social system of both countries and reemphasized through current
times. Women face many obstacles from birth and are often not allowed to access
to an education which continues the cycle of violence and prohibits women’s
growth in society and maintains the violent
patriarchalcycle.
Many times Congolese women are continued to be held back by
the misogynist teachings of society even if they leave their home country.
Women from both the Democratic Republic of Congo the Republic of Congo are in
need of empowered female role models to look up to and a historic opportunity
has presented itself and we need your support.



                                  What is the                           Miss Earth Pageant?


MISS EARTH is an annual international beauty
pageant that emphasizes environmental awareness and conservation. The
titleholders dedicate their year to promote protection of the environment and
other global issues. The winner of MISS EARTH
is the spokesperson for the United Nations Environment Programme and THE MISS EARTH FOUNDATION. The annual
competition is televised in over 189 countries.

                        A
Historical Opportunity
In
years past over 85 countries have had representation in the MISS EARTH PAGEANT; 2015 will be the first
year that both the Democratic Republic of Congo at the Republic of Congo will
be represented at the Pageant. This is a historic opportunity for the people of
both countries and the girls that will be representing!
Not
only will the pageant allow these young women to represent both the Democratic
Republic of Congo and the Republic of Congo on the global stage but it will
give them the opportunity to grow through self-empowerment and become a role
model to other young women both in their home countries and abroad. It will
also give them the opportunity to spread the word of peace and proper
conservation techniques to the people of both countries. These young women will
also show the diverse beauty and tenacity of Congolese women. 
We
cannot give these women the opportunity of a lifetime without your financial
support.
   
What We Need & What You Get
To be able to represent the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Republic
of Congo on the international stage we must first host a qualifying pageant.
With the bare minimum money of $5,000 raised from this campaign we will be
able to cover the costs for the first National MISS EARTH Congo Pageant and Fashion Show.
The Pageant
will be held from JULY 28th 2015 to AUGUST 1st 2015 at the Ritz
Raleigh in Raleigh North Carolina.
There’s just one problem do to unfortunate
situations and with sponsors, we need to fund the pageant ourselves. Now, we
are reaching out to you, our friends on the internet in our time of need!
And because we love to thank our friends, we have
thought of you every step of the way!

WE HERE AT MISS EARTH ARE BIG THINKERS!

</div></div>","THE ISSUE 
The vast freshwater reserves of some of the the largest North American aquifers, spanning across South Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming, Montana and North Dakota, are URGENTLY THREATENED by the plans of international URANIUM MINING companies seeking to drill unsafe Uranium extraction wells into the ground. This scientifically unstable and toxic process will leak RADIOACTIVE Uranium, Arsenic, Selenium, Radium and Lead into the aquifers and POLLUTE SURFACE AND GROUND WATERS PERMANENTLY, rendering these waters toxic to all life and a danger to future generations.  After mining, the corporations plan to pump the HIGHLY TOXIC wastewater underground into ""deep injection pools"", threatening the interconnected aquifers in the region -- the Deadwood, Madison, Minnelusa, and Inyan Kara.
In addition to the toxic pollution of our lands,  the extracted Uranium gets shipped abroad and sold on the foreign market for further unsafe use, mainly in China, Russia and India. 

THE CLEAN WATER WARRIORS
The Committee to Protect the Water is based in South Dakota and created by local citizens in response to this CRITICAL ISSUE threatening our water resources. Our purpose is to educate the public and spread awareness about the IMMEDIATE and long-term dangers of these mining activities.


We will not allow corporations profit from pillaging our mineral reserves and sell them to foreign entities who could conceivably create Weapons of Mass Destruction, while simultaneously destroying the precious waters of the Heartland of America.

Now we are committing our time and energy to create solid ways of stopping the destruction of our waters and sustainably protecting this delicate, limited and vital natural resource upon which all our people, ranches and animals depend. 

THE SOLUTION
To solve this serious issue, we must take strong legal action to permanently protect our waters from new mining operations being licensed. 
Right now, we are organizing our amazing team to immediately gather 20,000 local signatures necessary to place an initiative on the ballot for the 2016 elections, so we can PASS A LAW that will permanently protect our waters from irreversible damage. 
Please help us raise $50,000 to activate a strong grassroots campaign and fund this important water protection campaign! 



STANDING TOGETHER 
This threat is also a historic opportunity for all of us to STAND TOGETHER for something that affects us all equally: OUR WATERS OF LIFE. 
We - ranchers and townspeople, Native and white, business owners and teachers, parents and grandparents - have been uniting together in this region for many years to protect our precious waters. 



WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW!
There are many ways YOU CAN HELP US achieve our fundraising goal:
1) DONATE whatever amount you can give towards this plan now!

<p><b>One million acres of pristine rainforest have been conserved on Lac Tumba in the Congo Basin Rainforest. We need your help to keep this land protected while providing clean water, health care, education, and more to the communities living here.</b><br/></p>

</div><div style=""text-align: center;""><br/></div><div style=""text-align: center;"">Lac Tumba is a beautiful, life-sustaining, and unspoiled lake in the heart of the Congo Basin Rainforest, the 2nd largest rainforest in the world, second only to the Amazon. The Congo Basin Rainforest has one of the most bio-diverse ecosystems on the planet and is extremely resistant to climate change. Rainforests are the lungs of the earth. They remove tremendous amounts of carbon dioxide from the air while producing great amounts of oxygen, stabilizing Earth's climate.</div><div style=""text-align: center;""><br/></div><div style=""text-align: center;"">
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">The Congo Basin Rainforest provides food, shelter, water, and medicine to over 75 million people. Of the hundreds of mammal species discovered in the Congo River Basin so far, 39 are found nowhere else on Earth. Of its estimated 10,000 plant species, 3,300 are unique to the region.</span><br/>

<p>Go Conscious Earth is a U.S. 501(c)3 non-profit organization founded and directed by Godi Godar, who grew up in the Bantomba tribe on Lac Tumba in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). As a child, Godar, the eldest son of the chief of his tribe, dreamed he would move across oceans and return home to support and protect his people. At the age of 21, he moved to the United States. Almost 30 years later, just before her death, Godar’s mother revealed the dire situation of his people and how he could save them. She told him to stop the rainforest destruction that is devastating the lives of his people, killing endangered animals, and ruining the air of our planet.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433959021/mp35j5irlvzv3kwfokod.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 449.803921568627px;height: 259px;""/></p>
<p>Since then, Godar and the many volunteers who believe in him and his work have worked tirelessly to do just that. And in 2014, GCE successfully lobbied the DRC government to protect the first <b>one million acres</b> of rainforest on Lac Tumba.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At Go Conscious Earth (GCE), we have developed an approach that preserves large tracts of rainforest while fighting poverty and cultivating long-term sustainable practices within the communities living there. This approach will lead to millions more acres of rainforest conservation.</p>
<p>We have asked the communities there what they need and we are working with them to make that happen - simple projects that work. Freshwater wells, schools, health clinics, sustainable farming and fishing, and long-term income generation. And as we implement our anti-poverty initiatives, we are also in the process of conserving <b>another million acres</b>.</p>

<p>The Congo Basin Rainforest is being destroyed by
multinational corporations using it for timber, mineral extraction, and commercial
farming. Its destruction threatens to destroy the communities that depend on
it, irrevocably harm the global climate, and cause the extinction of many
species of wildlife.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Lac Tumba is home to 100,000 indigenous people. All of the people living here live without adequate food, clean water, healthcare, education, electricity, or transportation.  In their efforts to survive and feed their families, they are forced to use unsustainable farming and fishing techniques that harm the rainforest and the lake. They want to preserve their rainforest home, but they need more resources in order to implement alternatives to these practices.</span><br/></p>

<p>In order for the tribes living here to keep their lands protected, GCE signed an agreement with the DRC government and the indigenous communities, including the Bantomba tribe and Ba'aka pygmy people, to build a sustainable infrastructure. </p>
<p><b><i>If GCE does not reach its goals, the nearly one million acres of rainforest will be returned to the DRC government and would inevitably be sold or leased to corporations that would destroy it.</i></b></p>

 This Awesome Guy  is Fighting to Save This IRL Fern Gully

One million acres of pristine rainforest have been conserved on Lac Tumba in the Congo Basin Rainforest. We need your help to keep this land protected while providing clean water, health care, education, and more to the communities living here.

Lac Tumba is a beautiful, life-sustaining, and unspoiled lake in the heart of the Congo Basin Rainforest, the 2nd largest rainforest in the world, second only to the Amazon. The Congo Basin Rainforest has one of the most bio-diverse ecosystems on the planet and is extremely resistant to climate change. Rainforests are the lungs of the earth. They remove tremendous amounts of carbon dioxide from the air while producing great amounts of oxygen, stabilizing Earth's climate.
The Congo Basin Rainforest provides food, shelter, water, and medicine to over 75 million people. Of the hundreds of mammal species discovered in the Congo River Basin so far, 39 are found nowhere else on Earth. Of its estimated 10,000 plant species, 3,300 are unique to the region.
The area around Lac Tumba, and our conservation area specifically, is home to many endangered animals, including bonobos and forest elephants. The endangered bonobo is a very special kind of ape, sharing 98.7% of its DNA with humans and showing profound intelligence and deep emotional capacity. Bonobos are highly endangered and only live in the Democratic Republic of Congo section of the Congo River Basin.





Go Conscious Earth is a U.S. 501(c)3 non-profit organization founded and directed by Godi Godar, who grew up in the Bantomba tribe on Lac Tumba in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). As a child, Godar, the eldest son of the chief of his tribe, dreamed he would move across oceans and return home to support and protect his people. At the age of 21, he moved to the United States. Almost 30 years later, just before her death, Godar’s mother revealed the dire situation of his people and how he could save them. She told him to stop the rainforest destruction that is devastating the lives of his people, killing endangered animals, and ruining the air of our planet.


Since then, Godar and the many volunteers who believe in him and his work have worked tirelessly to do just that. And in 2014, GCE successfully lobbied the DRC government to protect the first one million acres of rainforest on Lac Tumba.

At Go Conscious Earth (GCE), we have developed an approach that preserves large tracts of rainforest while fighting poverty and cultivating long-term sustainable practices within the communities living there. This approach will lead to millions more acres of rainforest conservation.
We have asked the communities there what they need and we are working with them to make that happen - simple projects that work. Freshwater wells, schools, health clinics, sustainable farming and fishing, and long-term income generation. And as we implement our anti-poverty initiatives, we are also in the process of conserving another million acres.




The Congo Basin Rainforest is being destroyed by
multinational corporations using it for timber, mineral extraction, and commercial
farming. Its destruction threatens to destroy the communities that depend on
it, irrevocably harm the global climate, and cause the extinction of many
species of wildlife.

Lac Tumba is home to 100,000 indigenous people. All of the people living here live without adequate food, clean water, healthcare, education, electricity, or transportation.  In their efforts to survive and feed their families, they are forced to use unsustainable farming and fishing techniques that harm the rainforest and the lake. They want to preserve their rainforest home, but they need more resources in order to implement alternatives to these practices.



In order for the tribes living here to keep their lands protected, GCE signed an agreement with the DRC government and the indigenous communities, including the Bantomba tribe and Ba'aka pygmy people, to build a sustainable infrastructure. 
If GCE does not reach its goals, the nearly one million acres of rainforest will be returned to the DRC government and would inevitably be sold or leased to corporations that would destroy it.

GCE's commitments to the 40 villages here include:

 - Building 100 water wells

- Building and staffing schools

- Building and staffing health clinics

- Buying a boat to bring in materials and supplies to even the most remote
villages
- Building a simple dirt road/path and bridges to facilitate
inter-village trading
- Initiating and supporting women's income generation projects
- Initiating and supporting sustainable fishing and farming
techniques and programs.
The success of this project not only saves the lives of people and animals but also prove the viability of community-based anti-poverty initiatives to the DRC government, which in turn will allows GCE, and other similar groups, to save more rainforest here in the Congo River Basin. 

Working within the communities on Lac Tumba to protect tribal lands rights helps alleviate poverty and is an extremely effective way to save rainforest.
Your donation will go directly toward providing the resources and infrastructure that fulfill GCE’s commitment and which also empower the local tribes toward sustainable practices and a higher quality of life. GCE needs to break ground on building the water wells this year. To fulfill our promises to the DRC government for 2015, and keep this land protected, we need to buy a boat, buy a well drill and begin building wells.
But this can only happen with your help!




The destruction of the Congo Basin Rainforest harms the communities that depend on it, contributes to the global climate crisis and causes the extinction of wildlife. The future of this rainforest - that has truly astounding biodiversity and bountiful wildlife, that nourishes and supports millions of people, and that regulates Earth's climate and produces much of our oxygen - is depending on you, and your vision and generosity. 

You can help in two ways:

1.  Donate here today! Help us fund this big and challenging, long-term and sustainable project.2. Spread the word! Tell your friends about this opportunity. Please share our campaign link on Facebook, Twitter and other social media.Only by working together can we save this beautiful and
unique rainforest, home of the Ba'aka pygmy people, the Bantomba tribe, and the endangered Bonobo. 
From all of us at Go Conscious Earth, thank you for making a difference!


And thank you to our partners and supporting organizations!

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>My name is Mark Dennis. I'm a 33 year old Jamaican professional engineer with a passion for sustainable energy, environmental preservation and innovative thinking. I've always been highly driven, and a doer. I prefer to make myself a part of the solution, than be one of those that only discuss and debate the issues. For these reasons, I'm daring to take on two of Jamaica's most critical issues - energy security and sustainable waste management.</p>
<p>Jamaica spends around 16% of its total GDP per year to secure imported oil for around 92% of its energy needs. That's almost USD 2.5 billion leaving our country per year - in a country in desperate need for financing of its health and education sectors, to name a few. The high dependence on imported oil also has its own severe consequences; high CO2 levels in the atmosphere, high risk energy security and most critical - unpredictable and high energy costs. Jamaica has one of the highest energy costs in the world, peaking at US$0.44 per kWh in recent times. The high costs, plus their unpredictability, has led to a loss of global competitiveness for Jamaican manufacturers and even a loss of in-country competitiveness against imported products made with much cheaper energy. The high and unpredictable energy costs has also served to oppose the country's agenda for poverty eradication. Jamaica's solid waste management is also in crisis. There are no engineered landfills, just selected dumpsites with limited restrictions to public access. The result of this has been significant pollution of land, air and water mediums, high risk contamination to humans and animals, and very frequent fires (the latest landfill fire in March 2015 cost Jamaicans around USD 2.3 million resulting in health problems, closure of businesses and combating the blaze).</p>
<p>I'm proposing a solution that helps to resolve both issues with one swipe. Diverting solid waste to a well engineered and sustainable, clean plant; and converting this solid waste to usable electricity at a cheap cost to the public.</p>
<p>Your contribution to this cause will help to achieve savings to the country of around USD 27.2 million per year by avoiding the importation of 262,000 barrels of oil; you will help to increase Jamaica's electricity supply diversification by 5% - which goes a far way in lowering energy security risks; you will help me to produce 18 Megawatts of reliable power from an indigenous source; you will help to provide employment for 200 Jamaicans during construction of the plant and 50 during operation of the plant; you will help to reduce Jamaica's carbon footprint by over 100,000 tonnes of CO2 per year; you will help to divert up to 620 tonnes of solid waste away from dumpsites, and you will help Jamaica achieve a greener and cleaner image.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>With this dream in mind, I've finally been given an opportunity by my government to propose a full scale plan, at investment grade quality. Between myself, my family and close colleagues, we've already spent around USD 80,000 in cash and kind.</p> <ul> <li>I need USD 500,000 to develop a full scale investment grade proposal that will meet the proposal requirements of my government and financiers who have already committed to financing the building of the plant. The USD 500,000 will cover administrative costs, international consultancy fees (for mechanical-electrical studies, civil studies, topography studies, geotechnical studies, interconnection studies, environmental impact assessment, power simulations and analysis, waste studies), travel and accommodation for these consultants, legal costs, accounting costs and permit costs. I have about three months to do this as I've been given a deadline of January 27th, 2016.</li> <li>The truth is, I'm challenging the status quo and attempting to make history. If I'm successful in this venture, this will be Jamaica's first waste to energy plant, I will be the youngest national from a poor to middle class family to execute his own project resulting in benefits valued in millions to all Jamaicans, and I would have smashed the misconception that young un-wealthy Jamaicans like myself cannot be successful entrepreneurs with a product of national - and potentially regional impact. Help me to demonstrate to other youths such as myself, the power of an idea.</li> <li>If I fail to reach my goal of USD 500,000, my plan is to negotiate with the consultants, whom I know are sympathetic to my cause.

</div></div>","Short Summary My name is Mark Dennis. I'm a 33 year old Jamaican professional engineer with a passion for sustainable energy, environmental preservation and innovative thinking. I've always been highly driven, and a doer. I prefer to make myself a part of the solution, than be one of those that only discuss and debate the issues. For these reasons, I'm daring to take on two of Jamaica's most critical issues - energy security and sustainable waste management.
Jamaica spends around 16% of its total GDP per year to secure imported oil for around 92% of its energy needs. That's almost USD 2.5 billion leaving our country per year - in a country in desperate need for financing of its health and education sectors, to name a few. The high dependence on imported oil also has its own severe consequences; high CO2 levels in the atmosphere, high risk energy security and most critical - unpredictable and high energy costs. Jamaica has one of the highest energy costs in the world, peaking at US$0.44 per kWh in recent times. The high costs, plus their unpredictability, has led to a loss of global competitiveness for Jamaican manufacturers and even a loss of in-country competitiveness against imported products made with much cheaper energy. The high and unpredictable energy costs has also served to oppose the country's agenda for poverty eradication. Jamaica's solid waste management is also in crisis. There are no engineered landfills, just selected dumpsites with limited restrictions to public access. The result of this has been significant pollution of land, air and water mediums, high risk contamination to humans and animals, and very frequent fires (the latest landfill fire in March 2015 cost Jamaicans around USD 2.3 million resulting in health problems, closure of businesses and combating the blaze).
I'm proposing a solution that helps to resolve both issues with one swipe. Diverting solid waste to a well engineered and sustainable, clean plant; and converting this solid waste to usable electricity at a cheap cost to the public.
Your contribution to this cause will help to achieve savings to the country of around USD 27.2 million per year by avoiding the importation of 262,000 barrels of oil; you will help to increase Jamaica's electricity supply diversification by 5% - which goes a far way in lowering energy security risks; you will help me to produce 18 Megawatts of reliable power from an indigenous source; you will help to provide employment for 200 Jamaicans during construction of the plant and 50 during operation of the plant; you will help to reduce Jamaica's carbon footprint by over 100,000 tonnes of CO2 per year; you will help to divert up to 620 tonnes of solid waste away from dumpsites, and you will help Jamaica achieve a greener and cleaner image.   What We Need & What You Get With this dream in mind, I've finally been given an opportunity by my government to propose a full scale plan, at investment grade quality. Between myself, my family and close colleagues, we've already spent around USD 80,000 in cash and kind.  I need USD 500,000 to develop a full scale investment grade proposal that will meet the proposal requirements of my government and financiers who have already committed to financing the building of the plant. The USD 500,000 will cover administrative costs, international consultancy fees (for mechanical-electrical studies, civil studies, topography studies, geotechnical studies, interconnection studies, environmental impact assessment, power simulations and analysis, waste studies), travel and accommodation for these consultants, legal costs, accounting costs and permit costs. I have about three months to do this as I've been given a deadline of January 27th, 2016. The truth is, I'm challenging the status quo and attempting to make history. If I'm successful in this venture, this will be Jamaica's first waste to energy plant, I will be the youngest national from a poor to middle class family to execute his own project resulting in benefits valued in millions to all Jamaicans, and I would have smashed the misconception that young un-wealthy Jamaicans like myself cannot be successful entrepreneurs with a product of national - and potentially regional impact. Help me to demonstrate to other youths such as myself, the power of an idea. If I fail to reach my goal of USD 500,000, my plan is to negotiate with the consultants, whom I know are sympathetic to my cause. We will have to stretch what we have. I'm also avidly working with other individuals and agencies to raise additional funds that hopefully will be enough to offset any shortfall in this campaign for USD 500,000    The Impact Your contribution will have a significant impact on Jamaicans all over, but particularly the next generation of Jamaicans that will inherit this land, and will have to decide at some point to either work for someone and talk about the issues, or become an entrepreneur and help to solve the issues.
The project will reduce the negative impact caused by unsanitary dumpsites on the health of Jamaicans and the environment, reduce the country's CO2 footprint, provide 250 jobs to Jamaicans over its lifetime, provide energy from an indigenous source to around 45,000 households, help Jamaica to save around USD 27 million per year which can be spent in other critical sectors such as health and education and prove that our young Caribbean professionals do not have to have connections or wealth to cause national positive impact on a large scale.

Risks & Challenges
 The only risk of this project/venture is that the government of Jamaica can refuse and reject it. The relevant Jamaican laws are such that the project/venture must be accepted and endorsed by the Government of Jamaica.
This risk is one of the reasons why my team and I have put so much preparation work into this venture, with multiple meetings with all public and private stakeholders involved. We now have the blessing of all these stakeholders, and have tweaked the project so that its objectives and goals align with government policy, and all the project characteristics are aligned perfectly with the both public and private sector's requirements and goals.

<p><b>INTRODUCING CEDRIC FAYOLLE</b></p>
<p><b><i>Ocean Immersion
Project Director</i></b></p>
Born in Mauritius in 1981, Cedric Fayolle was 6 years old when his father introduced him to scuba diving. Before he knew it,
Cedric was connected with the ocean in ways he would not understand until years
later.

<p>In 2000, Cedric became a CMAS 2* Instructor and worked
at the biggest PADI 5* dive center in Mauritius. In 2001, he opened ‘Ocean
Spirit Dive center’ with the help of his father. </p>
<p>Since then, Ocean Spirit has become a well-established
name in the Mauritius and Indian Ocean diving scene and has built a strong reputation as a safe, fun seeking and conservation conscious professional dive center. <br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Cedric has also ventured into making underwater movies and using movies
to inspire and change perceptions. ( see some movie samples and clips in the gallery)<span>

<p><b><i>Goal – Get Underwater Footage that is Mind-Blowing!</i></b></p>
<p>We are going to do something that has not been done before - we are going to
take Mauritians and the rest of the world underwater without actually being
underwater. </p>
<p>How? With ground breaking 360º video technology. This
virtual reality video is truly amazing – it transports the viewer into the
environment in a way that normal documentaries can’t.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span>We will be amongst the world pioneers in 360º video technology in
underwater documentary. This latest high tech system for studying and filming
subjects will enable envisioning options with the <a href=""https://www.oculus.com/dk2/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Augmented reality Spectacles</a>. We will have people explore the ocean and
experience it as if they were there! We’ve tested it with people here and it’s
a mind-blowing experience! </span></p>

<br/>
<p>Detailed shooting objectives are as follow:</p>
<ul><li>The first step of the project will be to get some good footage in
     360º. While going out on expeditions for that purpose, the team will take the
     opportunity to document the work and promote it in underwater film
     festivals worldwide. First, it will serve as project updates on the web
     site and indiegogo.com so you can follow our progress. Secondly, if we
     succeed in getting recognition for this work, we might influence such
     educational approaches world wide! And you will be a part of this ;-)</li></ul>
<ul><li>


A 52-minute
underwater documentary and a 26 minute terrestrial documentary will be
produced. The documentary film will recount the human as well as the nature
story that unfolds while on 360º shooting expeditions, featuring a compilation of the most astonishing places and sights of the Island
     of Mauritius both above and below water. It will tell the story of the
     challenges faced and overcome, and the successes achieved through
     dedicated teamwork! It will document the shooting stages, the discussions,
     the education campaigns and the ongoing education drive through the
     formation of a self-sustaining marine conservation association in
     Mauritius.<br/>
</li></ul>
<p>The documentary will
be sent to 5 international film festivals:

<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<ul><li>We will document the unique
     shark habitats in Mauritius – the famous shark pit and shark caves of the northern Islands of
     Mauritius. These unique places are being promoted as dive destinations but
     without sufficient ecological concern. They are under great threat – and
     together we can change this! One of the deliverables of the
project is to set in motion a campaign with the objective of gaining World
Heritage Site protection for these sites. We believe that when the people of
Mauritius and the rest of the world see these amazing creatures in these
special habitats it will change their perceptions and make them want to protect
them with pride.

     precious reefs and marine ecosystems. Some of the specific causes we want
     to push forward include:</li>
<ul>
<li>Obtaining the support of the Government
      to gain World Heritage Site protection for some or all of the area
      around the group of small islands lying to the north of Mauritius. These
      are world-class underwater habitats that currently have NO protection at
      all;</li>
<li>Better management around the usage of
      anchors on the coral reefs around Mauritius. At the moment there is
      indiscriminate use of anchors by dive operators and fishermen – this is
      slowly destroying our precious reefs.</li>

<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>OCEAN IMMERSION -
PHASE 2 </b></p>
<p><b><i>Goal –Raise Awareness/Educate!</i></b></p>
<p>We will launch an education drive in schools, universities and through
public exhibitions to educate our fellow Mauritians on the wonder of the their
underwater heritage.</p>
<p>With this educational drive as the basis of our project, we aim to use
the opportunity to touch on sensitive subjects such as plastic pollution in our
oceans, pollution of reefs from agricultural chemicals, overfishing and the
need for proper marine protected areas in Mauritius.</p>
<p>Upon the completion
of shooting and editing 360º video footage, events will be organized to educate
and promote ocean awareness. The primary objective is to organize 5 public
exhibitions and 10 visits in local schools with 4 independent augmented reality
sets and computers.</p>
<p>The programs will be composed of small workshops with specific
subjects discussed related to the coast and ocean followed by a 2-5 minute film
with the 360º augmented reality technology.</p>
<p>Through this approach, we will be able to make people experience the
ocean as if they were there and discover what is in our Mauritian seas. (<i>Did you know:</i> <i>60% of the Mauritian
population do not know how to swim let alone appreciate what lies beneath the
surface of the sea around the island</i>).</p>
<p>We believe that to protect something, we have to know it, see it and
understand it and experience it. And this is exactly what we will do through
the VR technology.

</p>
<p><span>The public events will be arranged in strategic places to attract large crowds
of people of all ages, classes and cultures.</span></p>
<p>Finally, a fund raising event will be held targeting up to 50 large Mauritian
enterprises aimed at creating awareness of the project and its objectives,
which are:</p>
<p><span>1.<span> 
</span></span>To promote a sustainable future for Mauritius;</p>
<p><span>2.<span> 
</span></span>To reinforce environmental awareness and conservation through local and
international scientific, artistic contribution and conservative actions;</p>
<p><span>3.<span> 
</span></span>To create educational support using new technologies on a long-term
basis.</p>
<p><span>4.<span> 
</span></span>Finally, to establish an organization that fights and dares to speak out
for the things that can be changed for a better environment.</p>

<p><b>OCEAN IMMERSION - PHASE
3 </b></p>
<p><b><i>Goal – Create a Living Legacy!</i></b></p>
<p>The final goal of the project will be to raise enough funds (using this
campaign to leverage public and private funds in Mauritius and around the
world) to create and run (first 2-3 years) an <b>OCEAN IMMERSION ASSOCIATION</b> that will have ongoing campaigns,
projects and goals – building on the successes and lessons learned from Phase 1
and 2 of this campaign. The association will include core team members of the
Ocean Immersion documentary production team.</p>
<p>This association's primary goal will be continue the awareness and
advocacy work started with this campaign – working with concerned government
ministries and local communities and other partners around the world to better
protect and appreciate the precious marine environment of the Indian Ocean that
surrounds the beautiful island of Mauritius. </p>

<p>The different phases of the project each have their own targets and plans
to reach these targets. Cedric owns a dive center, <i>Ocean Spirit</i>. <i>Ocean Spirit</i>
will cover all the costs related to scuba diving equipment, tanks and the staff
of <i>Ocean Spirit</i>. Some expeditions,
however, will require renting larger boats and other logistics such as food for
the crew etc. whilst staying out at sea around more remote places (e.g. the
northern Islands of Mauritius).</p>
<p>Other shooting sessions will be on land and will require the uses of
drones, planes, and other equipment such a tripods, back up cameras, the 360º
cameras, reflectors, stabilizers, filters, hard disks <span>(the 360º video is in full HD and just 10
min of film can be as big as 80GB! Loads of storage will be required for this
particular video technology).</span></p>
<p>The budget also includes paying for sound engineers,
editors, studio rental, models, food and beverage, transportation logistics,
insurance and other unavoidable miscellaneous expenses. </p>
<p>Phase 2 will require materials such as
projectors, conference halls with their food and beverage services, permits and
marketing materials. Computers to accommodate the Rift spectacle sets will also
have to be purchased.</p>
<p>Some funding will also go towards perks as
gifts for those supporting the projects with their Indiegogo donations such as
t-shirts, caps, coffee mugs, flight tickets for expeditions and for supporters,
accommodations for hosting the supporters. These will be according to the amount
donated by supporters (see details below).</p>

</div></div>","About the project


This feeling, finally, that we may change things - this is at the center of everything we are. Lose that... lose everything.               
Sir David Hare 1947



This belief is behind the Ocean Virtual Reality (VR) Documentary and Awareness
Project – called OCEAN IMMERSION. If
you share this belief then read on – and join us! We are going to change things
and we are going to have fun doing it together!
INTRODUCING CEDRIC FAYOLLE
Ocean Immersion
Project Director
Born in Mauritius in 1981, Cedric Fayolle was 6 years old when his father introduced him to scuba diving. Before he knew it,
Cedric was connected with the ocean in ways he would not understand until years
later.

In 2000, Cedric became a CMAS 2* Instructor and worked
at the biggest PADI 5* dive center in Mauritius. In 2001, he opened ‘Ocean
Spirit Dive center’ with the help of his father. 
Since then, Ocean Spirit has become a well-established
name in the Mauritius and Indian Ocean diving scene and has built a strong reputation as a safe, fun seeking and conservation conscious professional dive center. 


Cedric has also ventured into making underwater movies and using movies
to inspire and change perceptions. ( see some movie samples and clips in the gallery)


In November 2014, Cedric received a ""Honorable
mention"" in the Blue Ocean film festival and conservation summit"" in
the Category ""Emerging Film makers""






Now Cedric has a much bigger dream! Cedric wants use video, photography
and most importantly exciting new Virtual Reality (VR) technology to launch an
educational drive in Mauritius that will change perceptions and change the way
coral reefs are managed and protected in the country.
With this educational drive as the basis of the project, Cedric is
partnering with talented creative people both from Mauritius and abroad for an
exciting journey, and we want to include YOU in this journey too!




OCEAN IMMERSION - PHASE
1 
Goal – Get Underwater Footage that is Mind-Blowing!
We are going to do something that has not been done before - we are going to
take Mauritians and the rest of the world underwater without actually being
underwater. 
How? With ground breaking 360º video technology. This
virtual reality video is truly amazing – it transports the viewer into the
environment in a way that normal documentaries can’t.


We will be amongst the world pioneers in 360º video technology in
underwater documentary. This latest high tech system for studying and filming
subjects will enable envisioning options with the Augmented reality Spectacles. We will have people explore the ocean and
experience it as if they were there! We’ve tested it with people here and it’s
a mind-blowing experience! 
Examples of spectacles that can be used for the visioning of the 360º
videos.  https://www.oculus.com/dk2/    or      http://avegant.com/







Detailed shooting objectives are as follow:
The first step of the project will be to get some good footage in
     360º. While going out on expeditions for that purpose, the team will take the
     opportunity to document the work and promote it in underwater film
     festivals worldwide. First, it will serve as project updates on the web
     site and indiegogo.com so you can follow our progress. Secondly, if we
     succeed in getting recognition for this work, we might influence such
     educational approaches world wide! And you will be a part of this ;-)



A 52-minute
underwater documentary and a 26 minute terrestrial documentary will be
produced. The documentary film will recount the human as well as the nature
story that unfolds while on 360º shooting expeditions, featuring a compilation of the most astonishing places and sights of the Island
     of Mauritius both above and below water. It will tell the story of the
     challenges faced and overcome, and the successes achieved through
     dedicated teamwork! It will document the shooting stages, the discussions,
     the education campaigns and the ongoing education drive through the
     formation of a self-sustaining marine conservation association in
     Mauritius.

The documentary will
be sent to 5 international film festivals:


1. 
The Blue Ocean Film Festival and Conservation Summit 2015/2016
2. 
Ocean Film Festival Australia 2016 
3. 
San Francisco International Ocean Film Festival 2016
4. 
Festival Mondial de l'image Sous Marine 2016
5. 
Wildlife Conservation Film Festival 2016

Examples of ocean stories we will introduce in the documentary:


The
life of the amazing Mauritian Guitar Shark (aka Giant Ray Shark) - Rhyncho Batus Djiddensis.
This amazing animal is currently Red listed by the IUCN (International Union for Nature
conservation). We will research its behavior patterns (including at night!),
feeding methods and show how their habitat is under threat. 
  



We will document the unique
     shark habitats in Mauritius – the famous shark pit and shark caves of the northern Islands of
     Mauritius. These unique places are being promoted as dive destinations but
     without sufficient ecological concern. They are under great threat – and
     together we can change this! One of the deliverables of the
project is to set in motion a campaign with the objective of gaining World
Heritage Site protection for these sites. We believe that when the people of
Mauritius and the rest of the world see these amazing creatures in these
special habitats it will change their perceptions and make them want to protect
them with pride.






The story of the
     annual breeding passage of large pelagic (e.g. tuna, Humpback whale, mackerel, jacks etc ) off the island of
     Mauritius.








We will also tell the
     human story – the meetings with local ministries to discuss ocean related
     issues and how we can help them promote and protect our heritage for
     generations to come. We want to work with them and showcase their efforts
     as together we find better sustainable solutions to protecting our
     precious reefs and marine ecosystems. Some of the specific causes we want
     to push forward include:

Obtaining the support of the Government
      to gain World Heritage Site protection for some or all of the area
      around the group of small islands lying to the north of Mauritius. These
      are world-class underwater habitats that currently have NO protection at
      all;
Better management around the usage of
      anchors on the coral reefs around Mauritius. At the moment there is
      indiscriminate use of anchors by dive operators and fishermen – this is
      slowly destroying our precious reefs.








OCEAN IMMERSION -
PHASE 2 
Goal –Raise Awareness/Educate!
We will launch an education drive in schools, universities and through
public exhibitions to educate our fellow Mauritians on the wonder of the their
underwater heritage.
With this educational drive as the basis of our project, we aim to use
the opportunity to touch on sensitive subjects such as plastic pollution in our
oceans, pollution of reefs from agricultural chemicals, overfishing and the
need for proper marine protected areas in Mauritius.
Upon the completion
of shooting and editing 360º video footage, events will be organized to educate
and promote ocean awareness. The primary objective is to organize 5 public
exhibitions and 10 visits in local schools with 4 independent augmented reality
sets and computers.
The programs will be composed of small workshops with specific
subjects discussed related to the coast and ocean followed by a 2-5 minute film
with the 360º augmented reality technology.
Through this approach, we will be able to make people experience the
ocean as if they were there and discover what is in our Mauritian seas. (Did you know: 60% of the Mauritian
population do not know how to swim let alone appreciate what lies beneath the
surface of the sea around the island).
We believe that to protect something, we have to know it, see it and
understand it and experience it. And this is exactly what we will do through
the VR technology.


The public events will be arranged in strategic places to attract large crowds
of people of all ages, classes and cultures.
Finally, a fund raising event will be held targeting up to 50 large Mauritian
enterprises aimed at creating awareness of the project and its objectives,
which are:
1. 
To promote a sustainable future for Mauritius;
2. 
To reinforce environmental awareness and conservation through local and
international scientific, artistic contribution and conservative actions;
3. 
To create educational support using new technologies on a long-term
basis.
4. 
Finally, to establish an organization that fights and dares to speak out
for the things that can be changed for a better environment.




OCEAN IMMERSION - PHASE
3 
Goal – Create a Living Legacy!
The final goal of the project will be to raise enough funds (using this
campaign to leverage public and private funds in Mauritius and around the
world) to create and run (first 2-3 years) an OCEAN IMMERSION ASSOCIATION that will have ongoing campaigns,
projects and goals – building on the successes and lessons learned from Phase 1
and 2 of this campaign. The association will include core team members of the
Ocean Immersion documentary production team.
This association's primary goal will be continue the awareness and
advocacy work started with this campaign – working with concerned government
ministries and local communities and other partners around the world to better
protect and appreciate the precious marine environment of the Indian Ocean that
surrounds the beautiful island of Mauritius. 



RISKS AND CHALLENGES
We have a highly qualified, skilled, experienced and motivated team  - but given the nature of this project (working
out at sea and underwater with specialised equipment etc.) there will be inherent
challenges and risks. 
Main risks and
challenges, and how we will work to mitigate them, include:





Risks


Risk
  detail


What
  we will do to minimize this risk




The weather


We need permits with dates for shooting certain
  scenes and actions on specific locations. Postponing them will be difficult,
  as we will have rented logistics such as boats, technicians and team members,
  rental equipment. Forecasting and timing will be crucial.


To mitigate the risk, we have
  scheduled more shooting expeditions as a safety margin.




The wildlife species


As we intend to film wildlife species, there is no
  certainty in actually meeting them. Secondly, if we manage to find the
  species, demonstrating some behavioral patterns for us to study is another
  part of the difficulty.  


We have scheduled more
  shooting expeditions and have researched the area to map the animal’s
  habitat. We will also make use of remote equipment to extend the observation
  length and chances of recording and providing safer team shifts and
  operations. We will also make use of Nitrox gas for safer and longer dives
  within decompression margins.




Cooperation


We will need many permits and support from certain
  ministries in Mauritius. We also intend to add one or two ministers into the
  documentary, hoping that they will support the cause and promote their aims
  and objectives locally and internationally through the documentary film.


To cope with this, we have
  some key people that can influence positive outcomes. We have a humble and
  noble approach and above all, we have patience and a never-give up
  attitude. 




Finance


Getting the required finance will be a great
  challenge. The project is a massive one and involves a long list of
  expenditures. We are conscious that the amount may be hard to get, but we
  have faith in our objective.


We can only work hard to
  inspire further funding through out the way and hope that people will see
  value in what we are doing and share it with their network.







WHERE WILL THE
MONEY GO?
The different phases of the project each have their own targets and plans
to reach these targets. Cedric owns a dive center, Ocean Spirit. Ocean Spirit
will cover all the costs related to scuba diving equipment, tanks and the staff
of Ocean Spirit. Some expeditions,
however, will require renting larger boats and other logistics such as food for
the crew etc. whilst staying out at sea around more remote places (e.g. the
northern Islands of Mauritius).
Other shooting sessions will be on land and will require the uses of
drones, planes, and other equipment such a tripods, back up cameras, the 360º
cameras, reflectors, stabilizers, filters, hard disks (the 360º video is in full HD and just 10
min of film can be as big as 80GB! Loads of storage will be required for this
particular video technology).
The budget also includes paying for sound engineers,
editors, studio rental, models, food and beverage, transportation logistics,
insurance and other unavoidable miscellaneous expenses. 
Phase 2 will require materials such as
projectors, conference halls with their food and beverage services, permits and
marketing materials. Computers to accommodate the Rift spectacle sets will also
have to be purchased.
Some funding will also go towards perks as
gifts for those supporting the projects with their Indiegogo donations such as
t-shirts, caps, coffee mugs, flight tickets for expeditions and for supporters,
accommodations for hosting the supporters. These will be according to the amount
donated by supporters (see details below).
Lastly, a contingency budget has been set on 15,000 USD.

withstand high temperatures.The next $2,000 will make this project a major success. 
We want to make our garden
kitchen the ideal space for holding events by improving the existing kitchen area. This includes renovating the sink and adding gas-burning stovetops.
We also plan to work with Chef Joni Sare to create a cookbook
and guide to the kitchen and oven, so anyone can easily make use of the facility. The cookbook will allow us to share recipes and cooking techniques
with any school that adopts our outdoor kitchen model. We estimate the cost for
Chef Joni’s time and materials will be $1,000. Eventually, we hope to publish this cookbook.
If we are lucky enough to get more than $5,000, we can afford to make the oven really beautiful. An extra $1,000 will pay local artist Christina Yaconelli to do a mosaic for the oven. Art in the garden!How It Will Help UsThis project will have a massive impact on our garden and the Foundation. It will be a lynchpin in our Diet for a Healthy Planet initiative. To pull that off we need a functional kitchen. This oven will also prove our model garden concept by showing prospective schools that a garden can be a self-sustaining and even profitable system, making it an even more attractive concept for schools.Thank you!Alrie MiddlebrookCNGF Founder and PresidentFAQ
Who are you?
We are the California Native Garden Foundation, a nonprofit
organization focused on promoting the importance and benefits of California
native plants.  We partner with schools throughout California to build
native and edible gardens in their yards, where we teach healthy eating,
gardening, sustainability, and environmental science.  We also host weekly
community sustainability events and workshops at the Middlebrook Center, the
site of our model teaching garden and the CNGF office.
What are we doing?
We are updating our outdoor kitchen to include a beautiful oven,
a better sink, and more counter space.
Why?
The kitchen improvement project will enable us to host more
community events and make our facilities a successful model of a
self-sustaining teaching garden -- a model that we will share with our partner
schools to ensure the longevity of their teaching gardens.",3.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<h3>Climate Resilience through Community Empowerment</h3>
<p>Across the African continent climate change is having catastrophic consequences such as unpredictable and extreme weather, drought and famine, and species extinction. Tragically, these effects are leading to conflict, social dislocation and poverty for thousands of communities.</p>
<p>For decades and in recognition of such challenges, the Global Ecovillage Network (GEN) and thousands of ecovillage communities worldwide have been pioneering and demonstrating best practices and success stories both to mitigate and adapt to climate change.</p>
<p>GEN is spotlighting how locally-led climate resilience can be replicated and scaled up to achieve dramatic results and substantially improve the lives of people living in poor and rural communities - especially in the Global South.</p>
<p>Introducing the <i>Pan-African Ecovillage Development Programme</i>: an initiative forwarding participatory community consultations that couple locally-led needs analysis with international expertise in holistic design. This process is bringing regenerative solutions to African communities to support climate change mitigation and adaptation.</p>
<p>With your support, we can continue to expand the <i>Ecovillage Development Programme</i> across Africa.</p>

Often defenceless looking wildlife can be deadly to its prey, and to potential predators. Among the venomous animals, snakes are one of the most widespread and lethal to humans. Arguably one of the most misunderstood taxa in animal kingdom, there is little research conducted on these cryptic and seemingly uncharismatic slithering creatures. Venomous snakes, however, are of great medical importance.</p><p>To address the problem of wildlife conservation and human welfare we dedicate our lives to study one of the most recognisable genus among the venomous snakes – <i>Naja </i>(the True Cobras). Our focal species the Monocled Cobra <i>Naja kouthia</i> and the Indochinese Spitting Cobra <i>Naja siamensis</i> are together responsible for the <a href=""https://search.proquest.com/openview/36865854a042b98ad84d1ef20c89fa45/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=7561"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">second highest number of snake bite mortalities in Thailand.</a></p><p>We use radio telemetry to follow our study animals in the forests, villages, and agricultural areas of the reserve. This is the best available research technique to gather long term data on animals that are so elusive and shy. We collect information on their activity periods, habitat preferences and behaviour, with special attention towards human - snake interactions. To date, in 3 years of research, we have learned that cobras and other snakes live among people on a daily basis. They movie through fields, gardens and around houses in the villages while looking for food and shelter, usually completely unseen by their neighbours - humans.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505332931/qx5a5t4guaihmoh0t40x.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505317060/kzacgxt34uhriobmks9h.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>Curtis and William at work radiotracking cobras in the vegetation. </p><p> </p><p>To keep both people and snakes safe, we provide a free snake removal service to the local communities.  Rescued snakes are then released back in to the surrounding fields.

Together we can do more! Who are we?Sakaerat Najas Project is a small independent non-profit research project, dedicated to advancing current scientific knowledge and conservation of True Cobras. Our target species, the Indochinese Spitting Cobra Naja siamenis and the Monocled Cobra Naja kaouthia, both listed on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and have population which are in decline throughout their range. Based at the Sakaerat Environmental Research Station, the project aims to improve cohabitation between humans and snakes to reduce human- snake conflicts within the rural communities of the UNESCO Sakaerat Biosphere Reserve. Oure small leadership team is supported by an internationally diverse mix of volunteers, eho allow the project to fulfil another of its goals - to provide opportunity and professional development for early career ecologists and research scientists from around the world.Sakaerat Najas Project team as of September 2017. What do we do?Throughout the ages people have been fascinated by venomous animals. Often defenceless looking wildlife can be deadly to its prey, and to potential predators. Among the venomous animals, snakes are one of the most widespread and lethal to humans. Arguably one of the most misunderstood taxa in animal kingdom, there is little research conducted on these cryptic and seemingly uncharismatic slithering creatures. Venomous snakes, however, are of great medical importance.To address the problem of wildlife conservation and human welfare we dedicate our lives to study one of the most recognisable genus among the venomous snakes – Naja (the True Cobras). Our focal species the Monocled Cobra Naja kouthia and the Indochinese Spitting Cobra Naja siamensis are together responsible for the second highest number of snake bite mortalities in Thailand.We use radio telemetry to follow our study animals in the forests, villages, and agricultural areas of the reserve. This is the best available research technique to gather long term data on animals that are so elusive and shy. We collect information on their activity periods, habitat preferences and behaviour, with special attention towards human - snake interactions. To date, in 3 years of research, we have learned that cobras and other snakes live among people on a daily basis. They movie through fields, gardens and around houses in the villages while looking for food and shelter, usually completely unseen by their neighbours - humans.Curtis and William at work radiotracking cobras in the vegetation.  To keep both people and snakes safe, we provide a free snake removal service to the local communities.  Rescued snakes are then released back in to the surrounding fields. We make every effort to keep the snakes within their own natural home range. This may seem strange to some, but studies have shown mortality rates in translocated snakes may be as high as 70%. The aim of our project is to bring about long term benefits to people and snakes through improved cohabitation, not short term fixes by snake relocation.Rescue of Indochinese Spitting Cobra Naja siamensis in the local village.4 m King Cobra Ophiophagus hannah rescued by local volunteers made its way to TV news. Photo after safe rescue of King Cobra Ophiophagus hannah in local temple grounds. To empower the local communities, we participate in a snake handling training programme for local rescue teams. This initiative hosted by Sakaerat Conservation and Snake Education Team, provides training to rescue teams throughout the reserve and further afield. Using different handling techniques, we help Thai people to establish the skills necessary to safely work with potentially dangerous snakes. It is seen as a key aspect of our work in the community so that they may utilize, develop and pass on these skills for themselves long after we have gone.Rescue teams snake handling training.  Why not just get rid of the snakes?With the decline in large and medium sized mammalian predators, such as tigers and other cats in tropical forests, large snakes may play an increasingly important role in ecosystems as upper level predators.

<h3>Have you seen cats in yellow hats popping up in your Instagram feed? Cute as they are, they are really cats for a cause. </h3>
<p>In 2014, I launched a GoFundMe campaign when I could no longer work a traditional job due to complications from severe Lyme disease. With the help of family, friends, and one generous soul I've never met, I raised a few thousand dollars, which enabled me to self-publish my first children’s book, <i>Oliver Poons and the Bright Yellow Hat</i>, of which I am the author, my mother is the illustrator, and my lovable rescue cat, Oliver, is the inspiration behind the main character.</p>
<p>It’s now two years later and we have incorporated our books into the Oliver Poons Children’s Company with a mission to inspire “Happy Children, Happy Causes, and Happy Careers” through the sale of our products. </p>
<p><strong>We have several causes close to our heart:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Animal Rescue. </strong>Those cats in yellow hats are a part of our #YellowHatsforCats campaign where a portion of our proceeds from our children’s books are donated to animal welfare organizations to help other rescue cats like my Oliver. </li>
<li>
<strong>Children in Need. </strong>Oliver Poons and his friends are happy children’s characters who bring a little whimsy and fun into the day, yet whose sweet and innocent nature make for the perfect bedtime story. At the Oliver Poons Children’s Company, we believe every child deserves a happy day and happy dreams. By sponsoring a book for a child in need, you, too, will bring a smile to a child’s face. </li>
<li><p><strong>Alternative Work. </strong>The Oliver Poons Children’s Company was created partly because of my inability to work a traditional job from a prolonged illness with Lyme disease. My mother (the illustrator) was also recovering from a severely broken ankle and unable to work a traditional job herself for an extended period of time. We have been able to repurpose our skills and create new work for ourselves despite challenges. Now, we’re helping others do the same through a new website, <a href=""https://differentwork.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">differentwork.org</a>. By purchasing a book, a portion of the sale will go toward helping to further develop this platform. </p></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Why is it the time for this campaign NOW?</h3>
<p>As our #YellowHatsforCats campaign has grown online, thousands of people have now read our story. On almost a daily basis, I receive heart-wrenching messages from followers who find themselves in situations similar to mine. They are experiencing the first hand effects of a debilitating illness or life-altering circumstance. They are at a loss as to what to do or where to turn. Everyone I talk to has a unique skill set and a desire to be productive despite their limitations, but cannot do it alone. The solution that came to me was developing an online platform, <a href=""https://differentwork.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">differentwork.org</a>, to connect people to share their skill-sets and create new possibilities. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>We are aiming to initially raise $100,000. With your support, we will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send books to children in need.</li>
<li>Support animal rescue efforts.</li>
<li>Help create alternative work for those who find themselves in unfortunate situations. </li>
</ul>
<p>The more messages from others in need of help I receive, the more I realize how much more could be done to build out our platforms (and how much quicker it could be done) with additional funding. We have the foundation in place, it's with help from generous contributors like YOU that can make it grow exponentially and have a significant impact on those in need.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>We're keeping the perks strictly donation-based and simple for this campaign. For each $20 contributed, a book will be sent to a child in need. We are partnered with children's hospitals, relief organizations, and literacy programs for children in underprivileged communities. Your contribution will also support animal welfare organizations and differentwork.org.  </p>
<p>Additionally, EVERY contributor is going to receive a special thank you on a ""Contributors"" page on <a href=""https://differentwork.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">differentwork.org</a>. If you'd like, you can also write a short message to inspire others that will appear on the site. If you have a website of your own, you're welcome to include that too. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>Since we're keeping our perks for this campaign limited to book sponsorships for children in need, if you'd like a signed copy of our books or other Oliver Poons products for yourself or others in your life, please order from our website at <a href=""https://oliverpoons.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">oliverpoons.com</a>. You're supporting us just the same!</li>
<li>Post your cat in a yellow hat on Instagram with #yellowhatsforcats! </li>
<li>Tell your friends about <a href=""https://differentwork.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">differentwork.org</a> and/or make a profile with your own skills! The more users on the site, the more useful the site will become!</li>
<li>Share our campaign with others &amp; follow us on social media!</li>

At the Oliver Poons Children’s Company, we believe every child deserves a happy day and happy dreams. By sponsoring a book for a child in need, you, too, will bring a smile to a child’s face. 
Alternative Work. The Oliver Poons Children’s Company was created partly because of my inability to work a traditional job from a prolonged illness with Lyme disease. My mother (the illustrator) was also recovering from a severely broken ankle and unable to work a traditional job herself for an extended period of time. We have been able to repurpose our skills and create new work for ourselves despite challenges. Now, we’re helping others do the same through a new website, differentwork.org. By purchasing a book, a portion of the sale will go toward helping to further develop this platform. 


Why is it the time for this campaign NOW?
As our #YellowHatsforCats campaign has grown online, thousands of people have now read our story. On almost a daily basis, I receive heart-wrenching messages from followers who find themselves in situations similar to mine. They are experiencing the first hand effects of a debilitating illness or life-altering circumstance. They are at a loss as to what to do or where to turn. Everyone I talk to has a unique skill set and a desire to be productive despite their limitations, but cannot do it alone. The solution that came to me was developing an online platform, differentwork.org, to connect people to share their skill-sets and create new possibilities. 

Goals
We are aiming to initially raise $100,000. With your support, we will be able to:

Send books to children in need.
Support animal rescue efforts.
Help create alternative work for those who find themselves in unfortunate situations. 

The more messages from others in need of help I receive, the more I realize how much more could be done to build out our platforms (and how much quicker it could be done) with additional funding. We have the foundation in place, it's with help from generous contributors like YOU that can make it grow exponentially and have a significant impact on those in need.

Perks
We're keeping the perks strictly donation-based and simple for this campaign. For each $20 contributed, a book will be sent to a child in need. We are partnered with children's hospitals, relief organizations, and literacy programs for children in underprivileged communities. Your contribution will also support animal welfare organizations and differentwork.org.  
Additionally, EVERY contributor is going to receive a special thank you on a ""Contributors"" page on differentwork.org. If you'd like, you can also write a short message to inspire others that will appear on the site. If you have a website of your own, you're welcome to include that too. 

Other Ways You Can Help

Since we're keeping our perks for this campaign limited to book sponsorships for children in need, if you'd like a signed copy of our books or other Oliver Poons products for yourself or others in your life, please order from our website at oliverpoons.com. You're supporting us just the same!
Post your cat in a yellow hat on Instagram with #yellowhatsforcats! 
Tell your friends about differentwork.org and/or make a profile with your own skills! The more users on the site, the more useful the site will become!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Four years have passed since we started this journey. This is the year it all comes together:</p>
<ul>
<li>Since Fetch began in 2012 we have visited 39 states, helped raise 1.5 million for other charities, started the country's first Service Dog Education Conference, connected dozens of people with canine assistance, published a book, were honored by the AKC, AHA, Rotary Club, The 10th Congressional District and more, and we performed acts of kindness for people around the world all thanks to the generosity of our community and we have impacted companies large and small and even changed many a corporate culture to make accessibility for people with assistance dogs easier.</li>
<li> From the beginning, our goal was to simply write a book about our travels and raise awareness about PTSD, Suicide Prevention and Canine Assistance. This year we are heading back in that direction while not abandoning missions we have accepted along the way.</li>
<li>With your help this year we can impact millions. </li>
</ul>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</h2>
<p>There are $25,000 worth of perks listed below to reward you for your help. </p>
</div><div>
<p>Here is our plan for 2017:</p>
<ul>
<li>We now have almost 180,000 on our vehicle. It is less than four years old. We need a reliable vehicle and one that can carry our supplies to expos and events. We have found several used vans with very low mileage that can suit our needs. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482963897/bjsugm8rrbbugwg4xyzz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
</li>
<li>I have dreamed of traveling the U.S. for these last four years. I have sought hard for an inexpensive camper that can save us travel money and give us the security we need to be safe, and secure during our travels. We have found one!  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482963926/uxlngtfxzetdrgjqvkbm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>

Deforestation, poaching, and fragmentation have comfortably secured the Asian elephant a spot on the endangered species list. Human-elephant conflicts, often resulting in death, are increasing every day. Methods to stop elephants from crop raiding are often expensive and unsustainable.Researchers in Africa, however, have discovered that elephants are afraid of bees. As such, beehive fencing is the latest and greatest hope in avoiding human-elephant conflicts. No other solution protects humans and elephants simultaneously in such a sustainable way.
Why should you care? Because without bees or elephants, even our own future is at risk! We need your help now to realize this project so that people and elephants can live together and so that biodiversity can thrive once again. Please visit the Bring the Elephant Home website to contribute now!

What We Need & What You Get 

We are looking to raise $3,000 in order to install beehive fences in the areas that need them most. The more the raise, the better we can do.

<p>
</p><p></p><p><i><b>OOLYGALLIES</b> is in development to be a TV series introducing little creators who live in the forest.  Their skin is green, their ears looks like that of an elves and their hair sticks straight up like a long haired crew cut. They have four fingers and three toes that point outward with long yellow toenails. The Oolygallies must do whatever they can to protect the forest from the bark beetles: Just one problem: they're only two inches tall!</i></p><p><i><br/></i></p><p><i></i></p><p>       <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457486360/xitqmvi30xyuz8kwksax.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 548.668px;height: 412px;""/></p><br/><p></p><p>Deep within 9200 acres of the San Bernardino National Forest is a small village called Lake Arrowhead. There is about 14 miles of shoreline, which is about 100 feet deep. The sun can be seen through the trees as the wind blows back and forth and only the sounds of the water can be heard within the forest. Suddenly, you hear Carnego yelling “Lady Rose had two babies... two babies the Lady had,” while he is running through the forest.</p><p>Oolygallies stand about two inches tall, their skin is green, their eyes look like that of an elf while their hair sticks up like a long haired crew cut. They have four fingers and three toes, which point outward with long yellow toenails, and the only clothes they wear is that of a skirt type wrap around which is made from plant leaves.</p><p>The Oolygallies get along with everyone and they don’t have any enemies until new bugs arrive in the forest. These bugs are the bark beetles, which begin to destroy all of the trees, jeopardizing the future of the Oolygallies’ homes and the forest.</p><p>At the same time they are trying to save their home and the forest, history is made in the Oolygallie family when the head council, Master Bay and Lady Rose give birth to twins, a boy and a girl. With it being a new generation, Lady Rose would like their daughter to be part of all the head council decisions, but Master Bay refuses.</p><p>The twin daughter, Lady Roxy overhears her parents arguing one day and they appeared to be arguing about her. Lady Roxy was upset so she went for a long walk and she gets lost. It is at this time that Lady Roxy discoveries another tribe of Oolygallies that already lost their homes. Lady Roxy becomes close friends with one of the children, Misha and a special friendship begins. Can Lady Roxy's new found friendship together stop the bark beetles from destroying the rest of the forest?</p><p></p><p><br/></p><div>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>We want this film to have a lasting impression not only on children, but on adults as well. The message of this TV series is to show the differences in all of us through the eyes of the Oolygalies. They teach us to protect our environment, our wildlife, the forest disease and pest infestations and what they need to do to protect the forest. At the same time, they find new friendship and together they fight the bark beetles.</p>

OOLYGALLIES is in development to be a TV series introducing little creators who live in the forest.  Their skin is green, their ears looks like that of an elves and their hair sticks straight up like a long haired crew cut. They have four fingers and three toes that point outward with long yellow toenails. The Oolygallies must do whatever they can to protect the forest from the bark beetles: Just one problem: they're only two inches tall!       Deep within 9200 acres of the San Bernardino National Forest is a small village called Lake Arrowhead. There is about 14 miles of shoreline, which is about 100 feet deep. The sun can be seen through the trees as the wind blows back and forth and only the sounds of the water can be heard within the forest. Suddenly, you hear Carnego yelling “Lady Rose had two babies... two babies the Lady had,” while he is running through the forest.Oolygallies stand about two inches tall, their skin is green, their eyes look like that of an elf while their hair sticks up like a long haired crew cut. They have four fingers and three toes, which point outward with long yellow toenails, and the only clothes they wear is that of a skirt type wrap around which is made from plant leaves.The Oolygallies get along with everyone and they don’t have any enemies until new bugs arrive in the forest. These bugs are the bark beetles, which begin to destroy all of the trees, jeopardizing the future of the Oolygallies’ homes and the forest.At the same time they are trying to save their home and the forest, history is made in the Oolygallie family when the head council, Master Bay and Lady Rose give birth to twins, a boy and a girl. With it being a new generation, Lady Rose would like their daughter to be part of all the head council decisions, but Master Bay refuses.The twin daughter, Lady Roxy overhears her parents arguing one day and they appeared to be arguing about her. Lady Roxy was upset so she went for a long walk and she gets lost. It is at this time that Lady Roxy discoveries another tribe of Oolygallies that already lost their homes. Lady Roxy becomes close friends with one of the children, Misha and a special friendship begins. Can Lady Roxy's new found friendship together stop the bark beetles from destroying the rest of the forest?
The Impact
We want this film to have a lasting impression not only on children, but on adults as well. The message of this TV series is to show the differences in all of us through the eyes of the Oolygalies. They teach us to protect our environment, our wildlife, the forest disease and pest infestations and what they need to do to protect the forest. At the same time, they find new friendship and together they fight the bark beetles.

<h2>So what's going on?</h2>
<p>The <strong>Mongol Rally</strong> is perhaps one of the craziest and wackiest motorist events out there. Each summer for the past decade and a half enthusiasts have flocked from all over the world to participate in what is essentially a grand celebration of human stubbornness (or stupidity): a crazy drive <strong>from Prague</strong> in Central Europe <strong>to Ulan-Ude</strong> near the Russian-Mongolian border, looking for as much trouble along the way as possible.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518031808/somdcy7x9dhtdgzmfh9b.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>A stereotypical mongolrallier (from the Adventurists website)</i></p>
<p>There are <strong>only three rules</strong>, which elegantly sum up the spirit of the Rally:</p>
<p>The <strong>first</strong> is that the vehicle must be <strong>small and rubbish, </strong>so as to maximize the chance of something <strong>going wrong</strong> along the way.</p>
<p>The <strong>second:</strong> you must <strong>make your own way</strong>, with no help from the organizers when something does inevitably go wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Finally</strong> and most importantly, you must raise at least <strong>£1000</strong> for <strong>charity</strong>. This is the tender soul of the rally and is the primary reason why it was organised in the first place.</p>
<p>Today we are asking you to help us participate in this life-changing adventure!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Team</h2>
<p>Let us properly introduce ourselves: <strong>Ilya and Vanya</strong>, two cousins hailing from Saint-Petersburg, Russia. Ilya, the <strong>cool guy</strong> and the captain of our little team, is working day and night in a small chain of coffee houses which he has recently opened in Saint-P. Vanya is our team's translator and is a <strong>student</strong> at Cambridge University and an aspiring Materials scientist.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519163140/zy3eb1y9ac2sv9chwcyz.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>The Team: Ilya (left) and Vanya (right)</i></p>
<h2>The Charity</h2>
<p>Charity is a core part of the Mongol Rally. We will be sponsoring the <strong>Cool Earth</strong> <strong>charity</strong>, one of the most respected climate change and humanitarian organisations, endorsed by the likes of David Attenborough. It is an oversimplification to just say that Cool Earth is ""protecting rainforests"". Their complex strategy in fact accomplishes<strong> three goals at the same time</strong>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518031853/vcq6n1z8vm1gkprtxzr7.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>The rainforest we are trying to help protect (from the Cool Earth website)</i></p>
<p>Cool Earth's approach centers around <strong>working with local communities</strong> living in the forest. Providing funding for education, food and water, local businesses and small industries, Cool Earth ensure that it is the local's interests to keep the rainforests healthy. This <strong>1) protects </strong>the <strong>forests</strong> and the incredible<strong> biodiversity</strong> they contain, <strong>2) relieves poverty</strong> in some of the poorest areas of the world, and <strong>3)</strong> provides excellent opportunities to <strong>study local wildlife</strong>.</p>
<p>Check out their website if you want to know more: <a href=""https://www.coolearth.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.coolearth.org/</a></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What will you be funding?</strong></h2>
<p>Our funding goal will be broken into <strong>three parts</strong>. <strong>One third</strong> of the funds we collect will <strong>go directly to Cool Earth</strong>. The <strong>second third</strong> will go towards funding all the <strong>nasty paperwork</strong> that we unfortunately need to participate in the rally: the rally entry fee, visas, permits etc. etc... <strong>The rest</strong> will help us to <strong>actually complete our journey</strong> safely: as you can imagine, driving 14 000+ km isn't easy or cheap - petrol, food, maintenance, bribes... and we need all the help we can get! You can either make a kind donation directly to us or get one of the great ""perks"" listed to the right.</p>
<p>If you cannot help us financially, we will also greatly appreciate if you can <strong>help spread the word</strong> about your upcoming adventure. Make sure to follow us on Facebook, Instagram (and/or Vkontakte): we plan to take <strong>many stunning photographs and videos</strong> along our journey, and to stitch it all into a <strong>cool film</strong> in the best traditions of <strong>Top Gear specials</strong>, so we're sure you'll enjoy coming along for the ride (in spirit at least)!</p>

<h2><strong>Thank you!</strong></h2>
</div></div>","So what's going on?
The Mongol Rally is perhaps one of the craziest and wackiest motorist events out there. Each summer for the past decade and a half enthusiasts have flocked from all over the world to participate in what is essentially a grand celebration of human stubbornness (or stupidity): a crazy drive from Prague in Central Europe to Ulan-Ude near the Russian-Mongolian border, looking for as much trouble along the way as possible.

A stereotypical mongolrallier (from the Adventurists website)
There are only three rules, which elegantly sum up the spirit of the Rally:
The first is that the vehicle must be small and rubbish, so as to maximize the chance of something going wrong along the way.
The second: you must make your own way, with no help from the organizers when something does inevitably go wrong.
Finally and most importantly, you must raise at least £1000 for charity. This is the tender soul of the rally and is the primary reason why it was organised in the first place.
Today we are asking you to help us participate in this life-changing adventure!
 
The Team
Let us properly introduce ourselves: Ilya and Vanya, two cousins hailing from Saint-Petersburg, Russia. Ilya, the cool guy and the captain of our little team, is working day and night in a small chain of coffee houses which he has recently opened in Saint-P. Vanya is our team's translator and is a student at Cambridge University and an aspiring Materials scientist.

The Team: Ilya (left) and Vanya (right)
The Charity
Charity is a core part of the Mongol Rally. We will be sponsoring the Cool Earth charity, one of the most respected climate change and humanitarian organisations, endorsed by the likes of David Attenborough. It is an oversimplification to just say that Cool Earth is ""protecting rainforests"". Their complex strategy in fact accomplishes three goals at the same time.

The rainforest we are trying to help protect (from the Cool Earth website)
Cool Earth's approach centers around working with local communities living in the forest. Providing funding for education, food and water, local businesses and small industries, Cool Earth ensure that it is the local's interests to keep the rainforests healthy. This 1) protects the forests and the incredible biodiversity they contain, 2) relieves poverty in some of the poorest areas of the world, and 3) provides excellent opportunities to study local wildlife.
Check out their website if you want to know more: https://www.coolearth.org/
 
What will you be funding?
Our funding goal will be broken into three parts. One third of the funds we collect will go directly to Cool Earth. The second third will go towards funding all the nasty paperwork that we unfortunately need to participate in the rally: the rally entry fee, visas, permits etc. etc... The rest will help us to actually complete our journey safely: as you can imagine, driving 14 000+ km isn't easy or cheap - petrol, food, maintenance, bribes... and we need all the help we can get! You can either make a kind donation directly to us or get one of the great ""perks"" listed to the right.
If you cannot help us financially, we will also greatly appreciate if you can help spread the word about your upcoming adventure. Make sure to follow us on Facebook, Instagram (and/or Vkontakte): we plan to take many stunning photographs and videos along our journey, and to stitch it all into a cool film in the best traditions of Top Gear specials, so we're sure you'll enjoy coming along for the ride (in spirit at least)!

Finally, if you are interested in a more substantial sponsorship, with more prominence in our pictures and videos, contact us directly to discuss terms.
 
The car and the route

And here is our very own baby, a Lada Niva 1981, proud scion of the USSR automotive industry, which at its respectable 37 years of age will no doubt cause us no end of headaches this summer.

Of course, there are more 'brutal' options of vehicles, but our main motivation in or choice is the relative reliability (nay, repair-worthiness) of the Niva and the optimal elbow-window height ratio!
""But what about the pollution?!""  we hear you cry. Well, firstly, we hope that the money we raise for Cool Earth will more than cover our slight carbon footprint. But more importantly, we want to stress that we in no way promote the use of old (especially Russian) cars. In fact, we hope that by demonstrating the hardships we will undoubtedly suffer in our old baby this summer we will be giving a stark example of why NOT to drive such cars.
As for the route: each team is free to choose how they get to Ulan-Ude: the crazier - the better and the more respect you gain. We will begin our journey going down through the Alps and beautiful Italy, then, by ferry - to the Balkans, through Istanbul and across Turkey. The combination of the Italian and Turkish summers in a car with no air conditioning - ""great fun!!""

The route we will take from Prague to Ulan-Ude, with the major points marked out
Then through Georgia, Russia and Kazakhstan towards the Pamir Tract - one of the most difficult and fascinating roads typically picked by ralliers. Afterwards: the Altai mountains and the entirety of Mongolia!
So help us accomplish something grand this summer, as we plod across the deserts of Kazakhstan and plunge through the mountains of Tajikistan, for a glorious adventure and for self-discovery, for charity and to save the planet!

I spent my youth in the Park of Monza and it is still my enchanted garden.
The Lambro River
The accident
Some response
Monza: the Park, the autodrome
Technicians were struggling with absorbent placemats and floating barriers put in place to intercept those 10 million litres.On 20th April 2010 the Deepwater Horizon platform exploded in the Gulf of Mexico.Both events were tragic: the black wave of the Lambro river for the Park of Monza and for the Po river natural environment and the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico for the whole ocean and the coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida as well as for the marine fauna and birds.
Lambro
Louisiana
Fauna
The TV showed fire and chemical dispersants everywhere and the fishermen collecting oil with their nets. On 4th July 2010 the giant ship “A whale”, specially setted up for this accident, reached the Gulf of Mexico showing the incapability to collect any minimum amount of oil. Centrifugal separators were also purchased by actor Kevin Costner which also prove disappointing.The fact remains that in front of huge disasters it seems that we can react only thanks to huge, complex and very expensive means like these here below. For myself the fishermen looked to be the most effective and environment respecting operators, lifting oil emulsions out of water with a so simple tool: nets!

Only the mechanical removal of pollutants effectively removes the pollution while solvents, thickeners and chemicals dissolve the pollutant in the water and poison fauna and flora or make it precipitate under the surface destroying its ecosystem and seriously compromising plankton. Fire poisons the air up to the highest altitudes.It's understood that in tragic situations it's necessary to get compromises among the various methods of remediation with the aim to reduce the damage as much as possible.At that time, I became to deepen the scientific knowledge on how oil leaks live on water and that knowledge supported me in starting to develop to the current OilKiller.It's important to say something about oily slicks life on water surface.
when the spill occurs into water, the oil undergoes significant changes due to exposure to air and sun (here the ITOPF page about weathering effects on oil spills)
in the first hour about 25% of the spill evaporates

the thickness of the spill decreases rapidly up to a few thousandths of a millimetre even after a few hundred meters from the point where it happened the slick tells you about its thickness showing its colour
  the oily patches are pushed by winds and currents and a part of them reaches the coasts
the main responsible for the introduction of hydrocarbon at sea are agricultural, industrial and urban waste (44%) 
degradation processes (evaporation, diffusion, etc.) are very fast and after one day the oil spill has already lost a quarter of its volume, has overrun an area of square kilometres and has thinned to thousandths of a millimetre. All these scientific considerations allow us to give aFirst conclusions:
the presence on waters of oil slicks is a reality, even far away from heavy spills and even in the absence of these;
the oily sheen that in everyday life can be observed along the coasts, sea front, docks, channels, etc. are the consequence of the drift of oil from large spills occurred far away, or of the routine activities in port areas (maintenance, refuelling, loading and unloading), or for the agricultural, industrial and civil discharges;
the presence of oily spots is dangerous to the flora and fauna, affects the healthiness of fish, crustaceans and bivalves (mussels, clams, etc.) that enter in the human food, dirties boats and infrastructure, generates bad smells, ruins the beauty of places and is dangerous for social life, tourism and economy;
the oily spots are always very thin except that very near to a disastrous event and nowadays there aren’t devices dedicated to their removal except for absorbent napkins or dissolving sprays;
to place absorbent placemats is a long work, requires personal and it is a dirty job; the sprays can be expensive and difficult to apply, they distribute the pollution in the mass of water or make it fall towards the bottom and on the one that it meets in the sinking: fish, miticolture, algae...
Up to the OilKillerHere a short story by images: Main values of OilKiller
efficient
effective
transportable
essential and simple
easy
free of dirt
EFFICENTIt does the job well and with the least possible consumption of energy. OilKiller performs in a new way or at least better than everything possible today with available tools.FLOC (FLexible Oil Collector), the interceptor of the water surface, was developed and patented and it represents the introduction of a new system complaint with the criterion of innovation.The way how FLOC works can be referred to weir skimmer that use gravity and pumps to drain oil from the water surface. Weir skimmers are dropped from a vessel by a crane.The hole of a weir skimmer is small and the device is designed to work at a fixed point.Operation requires:
a skimmer
a pump
a source of energy
a support boat
a crane
a settling tank
a staff
And here some pricesHere below the graphic description of the connection between FLOC and the weir skimmers. FLOC moves with the boat, goes itself to meet the oily slicks, can follow them, doesn't need pumps neither tank, stores the pollutants in its filters, only uses the energy of the outboard engines.Consider please the advantage of moving rather than being fixed: most skimmers have been designed to work at a fixed point. They are dropped in the middle of the spill with a crane and at that point they take the mixtures of water and oil to send it with a pump on a support vessel. Movement is a real need so that a few years ago some of them have been equipped with push systems to be little moved anyway remaining bound to the mother ship. Ships equipped with sweeper are expensive exceptions and there are few of them around the world. OilKiller autonomously navigates to the areas that have to be cleaned or rehabilitated.The advantage is evident and I wish to explain this with the pictures here below.EFFECTIVEOilKiller uses the flow generated by its movement to convey water and oil mixture towards a restricted area at the stern to meet elements containing strongly oleophilic graphene that captures the oil fraction by contact and absorbs it within itself by storing it.  The FLOC shape is designed in order to avoid filtering the entire mass of water intercepted. The oils float therefore it is enough to filter only the free surface. FLOC keeps the flow constant so that not to generate a brake on the incoming water, then splits it into two flows: a superficial one with the pollutants that flows through the filters and a lower one with the mass of water directly released. The contact of the oily fraction with the graphene takes place in an area that we have called FilterBox. All this to need the less energy possible to reach the result and make it possible to use only the small outboard engines.  The filtering system can reach up to 25 litres for each refill of filters; replacing the filter is very simple and easy; new filters are accommodated in the lockers of the boat and the same can be done with the used ones; it's possible to collect more than 200 litres of pollutants in a single cruise. The used filters can be directly conferred in a landfill according with local laws.TRANSPORTABLEThe goal is achieved through the chance of folding the hulls under the main structure. The hulls are hinged and moved by hydraulic cylinders. The hinges are the legs on which the whole boat rests on a lorry or on the ground. Opening and closing of the hulls is controlled by remote radio.ESSENTIAL AND SIMPLEWe deleted all those superstructures that could generate a difficulty of use or a possibility of breakages through a lot of analyses, developments and optimizations of all the equipment and assets. The boat is essential in all its parts and everything is very robust and rational. The hulls are bolted to the hinges and the hinges are bolted to the main structure; the train is a subsystem bolted to the supporting structure; the basic motorization is provided by two petrol outboards and the hull and train manoeuvres are managed by a simple hydraulic unit. The boat can be dismantled in all its parts in a few hours.EASY TO USEOilKiller requires only one operator that can easily perform all operations. Cruises at 8 knots and works at 3 knots lowering the train and catching the oily patches. Filters can be removed and placed with one hand in a couple of minutes.FREE OF DIRTThe boat deck is always clean and the operator doesn't perform dirty operations. The only caution is to wear rubber gloves to replace any saturated filters. Pollutants are never deposited on the boat deck.

characterizing element of the OilKiller project
includes the patented devices
allows the filtration activity

it is autonomous and fixed under the OilKiller main structure
it is adaptable to other catamarans or pontoons with a flat bottom and the necessary space
it can be used stand alone in a fixed position in the flow of a river or canal

The Train is a subsystem that anyone can use to contribute to the cleaning and maintenance of the water. The control of the levers to raise and lower the interceptor can be obtained with a hydraulic cylinder or with an electric actuator.
All developments are completed
Prototypes have been made and tested
The industrial project is totally defined
The supplier chain is defined too
The market analysis is running
Now we are going to build the first model of OilKiller.  You will make the born of OilKiller possible.You will make the project live.You will help waters.You will be proud to be in the part that takes care of our planet.OilKiller is OK, concrete, simple, effective, not expensive and for this reason widely distributable.The creation and marketing of OilKiller will be followed by two developments:
first one is about the adoption of vegetable fibers and food resins to substitute the fiberglass and change an old OilKiller from waste to recyclable material;
the second one, ahead in time, is a new vessel for the collection of solids from water, including plastic, being also this new device focused on the simplicity, economy and efficiency of the entire cycle of work.
____________________________________________________________________________________Now I wish to tell you
what we are going to do
how we will spend your money
how is made the definitive project
The steps for the industrial production are
milling of the polyurethane models of every part of the boat
obtain the molds from the models
laminate the fiber glass in the molds and extract the parts of the boat
get the steel parts (hinges etc.) by laser cut and bending unit
get control systems (hydraulic, electric...)
get engines and its services
assembling everything
Every step has its own costWe put our goal at 40.000,00 € to fund the models milling plus related costs.The flexible way allows us to complete one step after the other according to the thrust and the trust you give us.We will be clear with you by a daily sharing of the campaign path and after the growing life of every step till the launch of the first OilKiller.The definitive OilKiller designInspired to rationality and simplicity the design is made as I'm going to show you telling also the main directions that defined our choices.The base of all is the 3D modelling of the device in every single part Then the lamination sheets (a couple of examples)The main carpentryThe design takes note about the different setups that could be needed to answer to the 3 main fields of application in which OilKiller could intervene
civil areas
protected naturalistic areas
industrial at-risk areas
This was achieved by providing the necessary room for the subsystems and related services and splitting the hulls into two parts. The aft section houses the instruments (echo, clipper etc.) and the alternative propulsion systems: electric or hydraulic.Civil areasIt is the most common application and OilKiller is pushed by two outboards fuelled by gasolineProtected naturalistic areasIn these contexts it is generally forbidden to use endothermic engines and we therefore planned to adopt an electric propulsion by positioning the engines in the hulls and the batteries in the main body. Electric propulsion and petrol outboards can coexist on the same boat.Industrial at-risk areasIn industrial areas at risk, typically refineries, oil terminals and oil depots the use of devices that can trigger explosions or fires is prohibited. To solve this need we have envisaged the adoption of a diesel engine and a hydraulic unit kept in the main structure and two hydraulic turbines housed in the hulls. This setup too can coexist with gasoline outboards.____________________________________________________________________________________

OilKiller is thought to be useful to environment in a simple, easy and economical way.
It is robust and free of any complication that could carry difficulties or breakdowns.
There are no chemicals nor pumps or other machines; the only needed energy is the cruising of the boat.
It’s realized with 3 independent subsystems; they all three are joined together with bolts and nuts.
It’s possible to use different propulsions without the need to produce new parts.
The technology can be used in fixed position in the flow of a river or canals.
The technology is available for owners that already own a catamaran or pontoon.
The boat is transportable on a common light lorry.
The size allows to ship the boat inside a standard 40ft container.
Oil Killer use is for cleaning up and maintenance, for remediations in near areas, in form of fleets for Oil Spill Response.
We are sure that we have done everything that was possible and necessary to have the maximum security of our project. We also know we have to work but this does not scare and we are ready to work as hard as we have done up to now.TJP is interested in contacts with potential industrial and/or commercial partners.

<h3>Horses of Gili</h3>
<p>My name is Tori Taylor and I helped found the Horses of Gili.  I am a veterinary technician who moved to the island in 2014 to manage a dive resort.  It became quickly apparent that animal welfare was an issue on the island that hit close to my heart.  I began assisting with a spay/neuter program for island cats and soon thereafter became involved in the care of the horses.  The island already had twice annual free horse clinics but more was needed.  In 2015 we founded Horses of Gili and began a comprehensive program providing medical care, education, rescue, and rehabilitation.  In August of 2018 a series of devastating earthquakes hit our island the neighboring island of Lombok.  Our stables were badly damaged and all our funds depleted by purchasing food and medical supplies for the horses of all 3 islands.  Fast forward to now and we have located new property to locate our stables.  It is a more visible location and less prone to flooding.  We just now need to raise funds to build new stables to continue our work.</p>
<h3>The plans</h3>
<p>We have had a builder help draw up a plan for low cost stables made of mostly natural materials such as bamboo and wood.  The floors will be concrete due to the heavy rains we get here and a tack room and feed storage room is included.  We have planned for 7 stalls each with an individual exercise area off of the back to ensure the horses get the best care possible.  An isolation or stallion stall is also included to keep horses separated if needed. </p>

<p><i><strong>Welcome</strong></i>,</p>
<p>Our dream is for a village life based in conscious choiceful co-creation in service to a world that works for all.</p>
<p>We are grateful that you have arrived here with us; help us spread this message to those who will resonate by using the share buttons above.</p>
<p>Our research focus is on the application of our inner-connected group listening process at the interface between:</p>
<ol>
<li value=""NaN"">Individual humans and the collective being we enact as community (sublimewe)</li>
<li value=""NaN"">The relationship between human society and nature via food systems (permaculture)</li>
<li value=""NaN"">And into the relationship between the individual body and consciousness itself (plant medicine)</li>
</ol>
<p>This winter we will be deepening into our connection with the landscape in the form of a inner-connected participative permaculture group enquiry; listening for the One voice as it speaks through each of us, and all the beings present on the land.</p>
<p><i><strong>With your help we will:</strong></i></p>
<ul>
<li>Extend the kitchen [£3000]</li>
<li>Build accommodation for 8 guests plus residents [£16,000]</li>
<li>Construct a water collection system plus showers and toilets [£4000]</li>
<li>Decorate and equip the temple space [£1000]</li>
<li>Buy and protect 40 hectares of local forest that will otherwise be cut [£6000]</li>
</ul>
<p>The core aim of our group process is to learn to reestablish a conscious participative relationship with the foods and medicines we ingest, and the natural systems from which they come.</p>
<p>Running clear through the heart of all of our work are the threads of co-creation, self awareness and nature connection.  We offer presence and process to support each person in living in and through their core values on a dailly basis and to integrate expereinces from cermeony into everyday living.</p>
<p><i><strong>Living Compassionately</strong></i></p>
<p>We live firmly grounded in, and grateful for all works based in nonviolence - a reverence and respect for Life itself –honouring the creative healing soul-force within each of us.</p>

</div></div>","Welcome,
Our dream is for a village life based in conscious choiceful co-creation in service to a world that works for all.
We are grateful that you have arrived here with us; help us spread this message to those who will resonate by using the share buttons above.
Our research focus is on the application of our inner-connected group listening process at the interface between:

Individual humans and the collective being we enact as community (sublimewe)
The relationship between human society and nature via food systems (permaculture)
And into the relationship between the individual body and consciousness itself (plant medicine)

This winter we will be deepening into our connection with the landscape in the form of a inner-connected participative permaculture group enquiry; listening for the One voice as it speaks through each of us, and all the beings present on the land.
With your help we will:

Extend the kitchen [£3000]
Build accommodation for 8 guests plus residents [£16,000]
Construct a water collection system plus showers and toilets [£4000]
Decorate and equip the temple space [£1000]
Buy and protect 40 hectares of local forest that will otherwise be cut [£6000]

The core aim of our group process is to learn to reestablish a conscious participative relationship with the foods and medicines we ingest, and the natural systems from which they come.
Running clear through the heart of all of our work are the threads of co-creation, self awareness and nature connection.  We offer presence and process to support each person in living in and through their core values on a dailly basis and to integrate expereinces from cermeony into everyday living.
Living Compassionately
We live firmly grounded in, and grateful for all works based in nonviolence - a reverence and respect for Life itself –honouring the creative healing soul-force within each of us.
Lived experience of community consciousness, alignment with the wild beauty of nature and awareness of the innermost aspects of self are our primary doorways to a life of clarity, connection and choiceful contribution.
You make all the difference
Financial support of the project will :

enable the autonomy, quality and precision of our research focus
support ceremony being offered from within a priceless modern-tribal village structure
increase the inclusivity and fluidity with which we can offer back the permaculture developments and high quality learning environment to the local people

Our needs
Each of you/us has unique gifts, skills, networks and access to resources with which to support our shared dream emerging. 
We have a diversity of needs and needs on many levels . To enable us to move beyond what we currently imagine contact us with details about your skills and experience particularly the following areas:

working in the tropics as permaculturist, gardener or eco builder,
sharing Restorative Circles 
online, social media, website design or other contacts.

<p>Since, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/PureWaterRelief/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>PureWater</strong></a> has grown into an island-wide grassroots effort that has provided thousands of individuals with sustainable and accessible clean drinking water! We're just getting started and with your help, we're ready to officially launch the '<i>pay-it-forward'</i> <strong>PureWater for Puerto Rico</strong> campaign. </p>
<p>For every <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/PureWaterRelief/photos/pcb.158085694808389/158083234808635/?type=3&amp;theater"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>PureWater Bottle</strong></a> that is pre-ordered, we will donate at least one additional bottle to students in Puerto Rico who takes the <strong>PureWater Pledge</strong>!  Get this, with your help, we'll be able to accomplish the following with every single <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/PureWaterRelief/photos/pcb.158085694808389/158083234808635/?type=3&amp;theater"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>PureWater Bottle</strong></a> we deliver to a student in Puerto Rico! </p>

<li>Eliminate <i><u><strong>200</strong></u></i> gallons of oil, which would be required to manufacture and transport those plastic water bottles. </li>
<li>Prevent <i><u><strong>800</strong></u></i> gallons of wasted water, which would be required to manufacture those plastic water bottles. </li>
<li>Provide a student in-need in Puerto Rico who lacks reliable access to clean drinking water. </li>
<li>Not to mention, reduce pollution, save the fishies, protect the environment, etc. </li>
</ul>
<p>So, let's do some quick math - Let's say you choose to be a <strong>PureWater Legend</strong>! Your contribution will eliminate the need for <strong>15,000 </strong>plastic water bottles, eliminate <strong>1,000</strong> gallons of dirty oil and save <strong>4,00 </strong>gallons of wasted water. Pretty powerful stuff, huh? </p>
<p>We're not just stopping at schools and throwing water filtration bottles at kids, though.

<h3><u>What We Need &amp; What You Get</u></h3>

<p>I could probably write a novel-length book on why we need to kick the habit of grabbing a plastic water bottle when we're thirsty but I know you're an intelligent, well-informed, busy individual, so I won't waste your time. </p>
<p>While crippling our dependency on the plastic water bottle industry is important, we're also incredibly passionate about providing every single person with accessible, portable, affordable, potable water.

Eliminate the need for 3,000 plastic water bottles. 
Eliminate 200 gallons of oil, which would be required to manufacture and transport those plastic water bottles. 
Prevent 800 gallons of wasted water, which would be required to manufacture those plastic water bottles. 
Provide a student in-need in Puerto Rico who lacks reliable access to clean drinking water.

<p>With most of the focus on the 268 million tons of municipal solid waste produced each year in the U.S., you may think that is the full extent or bulk of the problem.  In fact we produce 2x as much in our construction and demolition waste and 28x for our industrial waste.  These are massive problems that have been given little attention or investment and the destruction of our planet is the result.  With your support we can make a difference.</p>
<h3><strong>RE:PURPOSE</strong></h3>
<p>We are facing many challenges in America today, and we thought, what if we could find a project that could solve more than one problem, help us fund our projects for improving our nation's sustainability, increase awareness and represent our principles.  What would this project be?  This would have to be a product or service that people need and want, without creating more waste.  This would have to be something easy to understand and explain.</p>
<p>As the mission of our first campaign had the theme and purpose to Reduce Waste, our project had to line up with that goal.  We settled on the repurposing of textile waste in the creation of new items.  By upcycling these materials designed for landfills or incinerators, we could both divert waste and eliminate the resource-intensive process of creating the textiles that would otherwise be required to produce the same item.</p>
<p>It was obvious that it would be better for the environment if we could create desirable, needed products from diverted waste textiles and materials.  Save natural resources and prevent the further polluting of our environment.  But we thought we can do even better than that.  We can increase awareness with a brand that not only represents the practice of waste reduction and sustainability but supports the mission of The Zero Waste Projects.</p>
<p>But perhaps the best part of this project was the idea to use our American workforce, displaced by globalization and the covid pandemic to create these products right here in America.  We can use sustainable (waste-reducing) practice to clean up our country, create value in our marketplace, generate income for the American workforce, and improve our nation's economy, all in one project.</p>
<p>This was the birth of our brand <strong>RE:BEL</strong>.  A purpose brand, on a mission, to make America the global Zero Waste leader and clean up our country.</p>
<h3>A little about us</h3>
<p>Nearly 20 years ago an episode of This Old House visited a Material Recovery Facility where Norm toured what appeared to be a new way that all trash should and would be processed. This was the first time I had seen a single-stream recycling project and that concept excited me and I had never forgotten that experience. Back to present-day America and 4 billion metric tons of waste​ later, why are we still making mountains of trash throughout our nation's communities? And better yet, why are we not maximizing and capitalizing on this valuable resource?</p>
<p>We took a look at the issue and found some clear and disturbing reasons why our country still produces so much waste and has fallen behind in the effort to effectively manage our waste​-​stream.</p>
<p>This is why we decided to do our part, with the clear and ambitious goal of ""Zero Waste,"" and with your help, we can make America the world leader in waste recovery and sustainability.</p>
<h3><strong>Three Principles</strong></h3>
<p>We established three principles where we would identify the opportunities for improvement within our economy and waste-stream.  Reduce, recycle, and reclaim.  We have set off to create projects aimed to maximize these three principles in a fashion that would provide the most beneficial impact in the most economical way to maximize both the reduction of waste and economic benefit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce - Our projects should incorporate the principle of reducing waste that enters the stream.  This can be through eliminating items or even repurposing them to divert waste away from our waste management process altogether.</li>
<li>Recycle - The idea to recycle has mostly fallen short of expectations.  We can take a material and return it to the production line in the same form (recycle), return it to the production line as a more valuable material (upcycle), or return it to the production line as a less valuable material (downcycle).  All three of these methods are viable and will divert material for better use and reduce the need for virgin resources.</li>
<li>Reclaim - The final step in this process is to turn the material into energy or a biological process designed to recover the potential of a material destined to be wasted in a landfill.  A complete transformation of this material will provide a new use while preventing waste, pollution, and resource exploitation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each project should take into account these three principles through designs that maximize these principles in an economically profitable solution to a waste-stream problem.</p>
<h3><strong>Mission</strong></h3>
<p>The mission of the Zero Waste Projects is to address the reduction, recycling, and reclamation of waste through various projects and partnerships to reenvision how we manage waste to achieve our mission of a sustainable nation.</p>
<p>It is no longer sufficient to seek economically viable solutions.  Breaking even is not a scalable business model.  With​ a truly profitable waste reduction and sustainability projects, we can attract the kind of investment and interest required to address the scale of this problem faster.</p>
<h3>Landfills</h3>
<p>Every year approximatly 90% of the 268 Million tons of Municipal Solid Waste produced in the U.S. each year is incinerated or burried. About half will be sent to one of 2000+ active municipal landfills.  With over 3000 active and closed landfills and tens of thousand of additional private dumps that currently or will eventually present an ecological crisis for a local community.  Below is a map showing the extent of the problem as it is know to exist today.</p>
<p><img alt=""A Century of Waste"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://thezerowasteprojects.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Century-of-Garbage-Gif.gif"" src="""" style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Recycling</h3>
<p>Recycling has a role to play in our waste solution, but what most people do not see is how little waste is recycled and the effect that this illusion has on how much waste we produce.  After all, if we recycled everything, why not just produce as much as we want.  The reality is that even a recycled item requires energy to produce and transport.  The best item to use is one that you already own, saving the resources and pollution that would have otherwise resulted.  Below is a chart showing the current averages of recycling for the base constituents of our waste. </p>
<img alt=""US Recycling Percentages"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://thezerowasteprojects.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4th-GIF.gif"" src=""""/><p>There is a misconception that when you place your items in a recycling bin in the U.S. that those items will be sent to a local facility and turned into a new item, creating a system of regeneration.  In fact, for decades, our inability to profitably manage these materials has lead to the majority being exported to less developed nations, promarily China.  Our recycling programs were a creation of the plastics industry, were never designed to </p>
<p>After China banned the importing of plastics for recycling the amount of plastic that was landfilled an incinerated exploded as there were not enough buyers of the kind of plastic waste we produced and we have long been deficient in our ability to profitable recycle most plastics domestically, 40 years later.</p>
<p>With new technologies and a rise in the international pressure of developing counties to better manage waste, we are starting to see for the first time, viable solutions for making cost-effective recycling a domestic reality.  But this will represent an enormous challenge as it will require massive capital inventment to create the thousands of facilities that would be required to address these 268 million tons of waste annually for a zero waste solution.</p>
<h3>Ocean Plastics Problem</h3>
<p>Even if we are able to recycle plastic 100%, plastics themselves still represent many environmental challenges that would require attention.  The damage to the environment from the drilling and fracking aside, plastic will still find its way into our environment, outside of our waste stream, and into natural habitats.  One such alarming case is the rise of the Ocean Plastic threat.  A material that does not degrade and only gets smaller has become a crisis for aquatic life.  Plastic is found in nearly all wild fish, with many marine animals starving with stomachs full of undigestable plastics, making them feel full or unable to eat or digest food.  In fact, this same microplastic is found in nearly every human on the planet.  We consume volumes of plastic but are not yet aware of the prolonged heath effects of these microplastics in our bodies as they increase with no end in sight.</p>

<h3>The Good News</h3>
<p>With awareness, education, and technological development, we can solve this problem.  Now that the problem is evident we can use that knowledge to direct logical effort to solve the problems we have created and preventing new ones.</p>
<p>The Zero Waste Projects were created with the mission to promote zero waste practices and sustainability within the U.S., end the practice of landfilling, and find the best ways to utilize our resources for a healthier planet.</p>
<p>There is no one solution and even solutions like recycling create complacency that increases waste and pollution.  We must treat our resources as finite and valuable, conserving these resources and through this, our planet.</p>
<h3>The Zero Waste Projects</h3>
<p>Through a series of projects, we will bring real solutions to our communities to address the reduction of waste to improvements in recycling waste and then reclaiming the resources that cannot be recycled.</p>

Our children and our children's children may grow up in a world that has forgotten where we came from, riddled with trash, pollution and disrespect.. or we can work towards reuniting humanity with the earth, honouring the sacred feminine and caring for our mother planet so that we may drink clean water and live sustainably, and enjoy the fruits of the garden of eden that we have been blessed to be born into.</p>
<p>This is my calling in life: to create projects that inspire and make a difference in the world.

<p>Through my work of blending people into the landscapes of the world, I hone my personal relations, further my sense of compassion, become more patient, and realise the importance of respect in order to be harmonious with the energies in the world. </p>

In addition, I intend that the sales of my artwork will not only elevate consciousness but will also enable me to expand my projects to supporting community initiatives that aid sustainable environmental projects around the world. 



These artworks also form part of a bigger initiative called The Gaia Project , a co_op for establishing creative collaborations that aim to impact social and environmental changes, and ultimately create a more sustainable way of living in the world.
Support and Exchange  Your support helps me launch The Gaia Project via two events that span over my four week debut exhibition in Burrinja Cultural Centre, in Upwey Victoria. These events are:
 1) May 9th - The opening of the Exhibition which will include a live painting installation and a talk about my journey painting people into the world, canapés and wine. 
2) ""Creation's Calling - Collaborating for sustainability"" - A collaborative creative event with music, poetry, food and drinks to support the work of uniting humanity with the earth. 
So where is the money going?
Printing and framing artworks!
Transporting artworks between Sydney and Melbourne
Food and drinks at both events
Invitations, marketing, written articles for papers and magazines about The Gaia Project, what why and how we are creating movement
Equipment:  digital camera, SLR lens, tripod, computer
All donations are welcome and all will be rewarded with gifts. The amounts are allocated with particular rewards, artworks in all forms. Everything is appreciated and everything makes a difference!   The Impact Although I am the vessel for these creations, the intention is vast and extends to the whole world. Our children and our children's children may grow up in a world that has forgotten where we came from, riddled with trash, pollution and disrespect.. or we can work towards reuniting humanity with the earth, honouring the sacred feminine and caring for our mother planet so that we may drink clean water and live sustainably, and enjoy the fruits of the garden of eden that we have been blessed to be born into.
This is my calling in life: to create projects that inspire and make a difference in the world. For me, there is no bigger reason to be alive other than to work towards a conscious existence, create awareness through art and inspire my fellow humans to imbue their lives with joy, creativity and service.     Risks & Challenges Despite the fact that each piece of art is an expedition in of itself, full of challenges, difficulties, intensity and pain, the truth is that there is nothing other than funds that can get in the way of these goals. I am committed and compelled to continue making art that inspires the people of the world. I am completely driven to be involved in collaborative creative projects that elevate consciousness. 
Through my work of blending people into the landscapes of the world, I hone my personal relations, further my sense of compassion, become more patient, and realise the importance of respect in order to be harmonious with the energies in the world. 
Knowing that I have support from the people who are watching these creations emerge gives me the sustenance to continue and become stronger in my visions.    Other Ways You Can Help

</div></div>","The Clean Sea Fuels Story4 billion people can't recycle. This is a crisis. But why can't these communities recycle? One word: Access. Many countries, cities, and communities in the developing world don't have the money or the political will to invest in recycling infrastructure such as recycling trucks and centralized recycling facilities. Without access to recycling, plastics and oil run into waterways and end up in communities' ground water and the world's oceans. We have created an innovative, scalable, and sustainable solution to give everyone in the world access to recycling. Now we need you're generous support to launch.

We have invented the Micro Recycling Facility (""Mike"" for short), that fits on the bed of a truck and recycles plastic and waste engine oil into diesel, kerosene, and gasoline. The Mike uses a process called ""pyrolysis"" - the same process and technology done at a big expensive recycling facility but we've shrunk it down to make it mobile and decentralized. 




What makes Mike revolutionary is that we are using its unique portability to practice ""Compensated Recycling"" - meaning paying people to collect and separate recyclable waste. 
In rich countries we all separate our waste for free and pay taxes to have a centralized agency recycle, but in poor countries it lays on the ground, gets burned, or dumped in the ocean.  We want to change this by paying people for their garbage. We can afford to do this because we turn the waste into salable fuels which allow us to buy more machines, go into new communities, and buy more garbage. By paying systematically we effectively plant and cultivate a recycling culture everywhere.




Imagine Cape Coast, a city of 250,000 people in Ghana. There is roughly 10 million tons of plastic and waste engine oil dumped in this city every year because there is little to no recycling. Imagine we deploy three Mike's each with a locally trained team of technicians.

Cleaning up the environment and  recycling 

2. Making communities money through Compensated Recycling and hiring teammates

3. Creating a valuable cleaner DIY diesel, kerosene, and gasoline instead of polluting the waterways with plastic garbage and dumped engine oil.

Operation SPLASH Volunteers have been cleaning the Long Island waterways for 25 years with boats in 6 south shore communities.

This year SPLASH is funding a new baby! The custom built Babylon boat will reach even further east. Be a part of this solution!

In 2014, SPLASH collected more than 198,000 pounds of garbage from the Western Bays along Nassau County. This new boat will mean that we can help protect and restore the Great South Bay,too.Give your support to keep our bays clean!
What We Need & What You Get
 We can break it down for you!
The $20,000 goal will fund a new boat that will be docked on the Nassau/Suffolk border. This boat was launched in July 2015, but the bills are still coming in!
Your generosity and concern could never be fully compensated, but please check out our 'perks' to see how we would like to acknowledge your contributions!

On Long Island, street trash gets washed directly down the storm drains on your streets. This trash is carried untreated, directly into the bays. Let's add garbage cans and recycling bins without lids, construction debris from SANDY rebuilds and mix in some strong winds. What do ya got? 


A whole lot of garbage that fish think is food.


 


No municipality funds the removal of the trash once it hits the water.
Operation SPLASH does!
Save the lives of marine creatures from the comfort of your computer screen by increasing our fleet by one more boat this year! Be someone who makes this happen! 
From one small Garvey in 1990 to a fleet of seven in 2015, SPLASH chapters have developed all the way from Queens to the Suffolk border. This season, the new boat will push our area of service into the Great South Bay!


In addition to making us yell, 'Yippe-yi-yo-yi-yay-Yabadaba-doo!"", your generous gift will go directly to :

Design and building costs of the hull, especially designed for volunteers to jump on and off into the marshes with their nets, buckets and garbage pickers

Important safety equipment for the 100+ volunteers who will go trash fishing each season, saving the creatures in our ecosystem from sickness and death.

 

Risks & Challenges

 SPLASH  has already received a free dock space and dumpster from Marine Max in Lindenhurst, lots of volunteer folks raising their hands to crew the trash hunting trips, qualified boat handlers to captain the boat....
.....now we just need you to help us pay off the boat building costs.
We are hoping, dreaming that our ridiculously frugal volunteer leaders will relax when they see the dollars streaming in. With our careful planning, we will just scrape by in 2015 fueling all the boats this season, replacing worn out life vests, repairing nets and restocking gloves. Oh, and the hundreds of black trash bags we fill up each month. 
So, we hope your help will keep us out on the water, doing that thing we do best. Collecting Garbage!

</ul>What do your kids do outside in the summer?  Play ball?  Throw a Frisbee?  Maybe they run through the sprinkler?  <br/><br/>What are they doing when they are at a friends house or the local ball field? <br/><br/>Playing on the grass!<br/><br/>How could you have known that by doing these simple things on a ""chemical"" lawn they might have quadrupled their risk of soft-tissue sarcoma and leukemia?  (Independent study of Denver children under that age of 15 published by Am. J. Public Health 1995).<br/><br/>Did you know that the American Academy of Pediatrics cited that there is a link between exposure to lawn chemicals and pediatric cancers and behavioral problems?  <br/>
<br/>You probably didn't  and that's what our Mission is all about, because you need to know!!!<br/>

</ul>My dog loves to catch golf balls as you hit them.  She'll run through the grass sniffing and searching for her trophy over and over again.  My friend has a dog  that actually likes to eat the grass!  I'll bet you or somebody you know has a pet that loves to be outside playing in the grass too.<br/><br/>Did you know that research done by Purdue University and the University of North Carolina shows that weed control chemicals can be found in the urine of three of every four dogs who's homes use synthetic chemical lawn care?<br/><br/>Maybe that's why the University of Pennsylvania found that exposure to lawn chemicals ""significantly increases"" your dogs risk of bladder cancer. <br/>
<br/>Even wild birds commonly die from pesticide poisoning.  According to the National Audubon Society, millions die each year.<br/><br/>The biggest question here is why do animal lovers continue to expose their pets to lawn chemicals.    Why do they?<br/><br/>The fact is that they just aren't aware and that's what the Mission is all about.<br/><br/>

</ul>You see it happen every summer.  A local beach is closed because of an ""Algae Bloom.""  When fertilizers run off from lawns they end up in the water.   The algae bloom caused by this run off depletes the water of oxygen, creates toxic bacteria and can destroy the local ecosystem. <br/><br/>Did you know that last year, over 400,000 people in Toledo, Ohio went days without drinking water, because their water was made toxic by algae blooms?<br/><br/>Did you know that there is a ""dead zone"" in the Gulf of Mexico at the mouth of the Mississippi River?  It's caused by runoff of nitrogen and phosphorous from fertilizers. BeeSafe® is phosphorous-free and has natural sources of nitrogen that don't run-off.<br/>
<br/>Did you know that certain studies of major rivers and streams have documented that 100 percent

</div>","Click on the Bee above to see our video""BeeSafe® Mission 50"" is about converting 50% of alllawn care to Organics by the year 2025.

Every year millions of pounds of harmful synthetic chemical fertilizers 
and toxic pesticides are used on lawns all across our country.Do you care about protecting kids from cancer and learning disabilities?Do you care about dogs getting lymphoma and bladder cancer?Do you care about preventing water pollution and damage to ecosystems?Do you care about the collapse of Bee colonies?Then please help us! Even a $5 or $10 contribution will help get the word out that there is a safer and natural way to have a beautiful lawn. Please join the BeeSafe® Mission 50 movement.Why aren't more people concerned?  Good Question!People go to Whole Foods, or buy ""green"" products, but most people just aren't aware of the hazards from lawn chemicals.  Pesticides and Kids


What do your kids do outside in the summer?  Play ball?  Throw a Frisbee?  Maybe they run through the sprinkler?  What are they doing when they are at a friends house or the local ball field? Playing on the grass!How could you have known that by doing these simple things on a ""chemical"" lawn they might have quadrupled their risk of soft-tissue sarcoma and leukemia?  (Independent study of Denver children under that age of 15 published by Am. J. Public Health 1995).Did you know that the American Academy of Pediatrics cited that there is a link between exposure to lawn chemicals and pediatric cancers and behavioral problems?  
You probably didn't  and that's what our Mission is all about, because you need to know!!!
Pesticides and Pets 
My dog loves to catch golf balls as you hit them.  She'll run through the grass sniffing and searching for her trophy over and over again.  My friend has a dog  that actually likes to eat the grass!  I'll bet you or somebody you know has a pet that loves to be outside playing in the grass too.Did you know that research done by Purdue University and the University of North Carolina shows that weed control chemicals can be found in the urine of three of every four dogs who's homes use synthetic chemical lawn care?Maybe that's why the University of Pennsylvania found that exposure to lawn chemicals ""significantly increases"" your dogs risk of bladder cancer. 
Even wild birds commonly die from pesticide poisoning.  According to the National Audubon Society, millions die each year.The biggest question here is why do animal lovers continue to expose their pets to lawn chemicals.    Why do they?The fact is that they just aren't aware and that's what the Mission is all about.
Fertilizers and Water Pollution
You see it happen every summer.  A local beach is closed because of an ""Algae Bloom.""  When fertilizers run off from lawns they end up in the water.   The algae bloom caused by this run off depletes the water of oxygen, creates toxic bacteria and can destroy the local ecosystem. Did you know that last year, over 400,000 people in Toledo, Ohio went days without drinking water, because their water was made toxic by algae blooms?Did you know that there is a ""dead zone"" in the Gulf of Mexico at the mouth of the Mississippi River?  It's caused by runoff of nitrogen and phosphorous from fertilizers. BeeSafe® is phosphorous-free and has natural sources of nitrogen that don't run-off.
Did you know that certain studies of major rivers and streams have documented that 100 percent
            of all surface water samples contained one or more pesticides at
            detectable levels?  Or that 96 percent of all fish analyzed by the US Geological Survey contained residues of one or more pesticides
            at detectable levels?You probably didn't and this is what the Mission is all about!Pesticides and PollinatorsThe next time you are at the supermarket take a good look at the produce department.  Try to fathom that 70% of all fruits and vegetables are grown thanks to the fact that the plants are pollinated by bees.  Now try to fathom them gone.  Did you know that the most commonly used class of insecticides (neonicotinoids) in the U.S. has been linked to the acute die off of bees and other pollinators.Colony Collapse Disorder is when worker bees become disoriented and don't return to their colony.  Without the worker bees, the Queen dies and the colony is destroyed.
 Researchers of this environmental disaster estimate that nearly one-third of all honey bee colonies in the country have vanished.Did you know that the use of common pesticides affects your food supply?  
If only more people were aware....This is what the Mission hopes to accomplish.

<p>The garden is coordinated by Richard, a local gardener with many years of experience and long term connection to the site, and Rachel, a local edible horticulturalist with experience in community projects and permaculture.</p>
<p>They are supported by the many and varied volunteers who visit the garden on Wednesdays, and many hands contribute to the running of the garden.</p>
<p>We have many funding applications in progress but as yet have not secured funding for our second year and we will have to close at the end of September if this doesn't change.</p>
<p>Help us keep the garden open for all who enjoy it currently and may enjoy it in the future - this is an opportunity to create an outdoor project for the people of Abingdon and Drayton to enjoy.</p>

</div></div>","Anthea Norman-Taylor wanted to share some of her beautiful land in between Abingdon and Drayton, and enable others to benefit from the nature, the biodiversity and the potential of the land she owns.
Much of it untouched and un-managed for years, our site has grown into a thriving fruit and vegetable organic garden with hens and bees; a perfect learning environment for everyone to enjoy.  
We are open every Wednesday to everyone, sharing in the work of managing the garden and enjoying the produce together.
Our users benefit from our garden in many ways:

Learning about growing food, soil health, reducing waste and environmental impact
Outdoor exercise
Education on healthy eating
Access to green spaces
A chance to enjoy and learn about nature
Social interaction
Building community around food


The garden is coordinated by Richard, a local gardener with many years of experience and long term connection to the site, and Rachel, a local edible horticulturalist with experience in community projects and permaculture.
They are supported by the many and varied volunteers who visit the garden on Wednesdays, and many hands contribute to the running of the garden.
We have many funding applications in progress but as yet have not secured funding for our second year and we will have to close at the end of September if this doesn't change.
Help us keep the garden open for all who enjoy it currently and may enjoy it in the future - this is an opportunity to create an outdoor project for the people of Abingdon and Drayton to enjoy.
We currently support 10-15 visitors each Wednesday, with more people popping in, and other groups using the site throughout the months.

Our minimum target raise is £2,000 which will enable us to stay open for the rest of 2017, welcome over 100 people to the garden and secure funding going forward (it costs us £300 per week to keep the garden open, watered, the chickens fed and all our plants, tools and materials included).
We have lots of exciting ways you can support us - both with your time and with your money, and our perks make great presents even if they're not for you!
Even if we don't reach our target, your money will still go towards the perk you bought, and we will continue to work hard on keeping the garden open - every little bit really does help, so if you can, please support us in any way you can.
This is your chance to keep our chickens warm, support our solar hot water system or grab yourself a place on one of our exciting workshops learning new skills and meeting other locals.

L’association cherche à promouvoir toute activité visant à verdir, favoriser la biodiversité et fertiliser les espaces gris et stériles trop présents dans les grandes agglomérations.Nous voyons en l’agriculture urbaine différents avantages tels que:
La valorisation d’espaces urbains inexploités
Le développement d'une indépendance alimentaire des villes
L'extension de l’offre d’aliments locaux
Le rapprochement entre producteurs et consommateurs
La réduction des impacts financiers et écologiques liés au transport
L'encouragement d'une consommation de variétés locales

Le développement d’une vitrine de communication pour l’agriculture en ville


L’aquaponie par Exodes UrbainsLe but de ce projet est de promouvoir l’aquaponie en Suisse romande en installant une micro-ferme  aquaponique au coeur de Genève.Je sais très bien ce que vous vous demandez à l’instant même où vous lisez ce descriptif:”Mais c’est quoi au juste l’aquaponie?”L’aquaponie est né de l’union des termes aquaculture - élevage d’organismes aquatiques - et hydroponie - culture de plantes dans un substrat enrichi. La contraction de ces deux termes résume bien le principe de symbiose entre les deux techniques. En effet, une relation d’interdépendance se crée entre la production de plantes et de poissons.Le principe de l’aquaponie consiste à associer l’élevage de poissons et la culture de plantes dans une même production sur des surfaces hors-sol réduites. Il s’agit d’un système vertueux où les déchets engendrés par les poissons sont utilisés comme engrais pour les plantes qui de leurs côtés jouent un rôle de filtre biologique en purifiant l’eau des effluents engendrés par les poissons, et la boucle est bouclée.L’aquaponie s’inscrit comme une réponse écologiquement et économiquement viable aux besoins et aux envies des consommateurs d’aujourd’hui. En effet, elle assure une production avec une rentabilité optimale de l’espace, associée à une consommation d’eau réduite et un rejet de déchet minimisé. De plus, les aliments produits sont d’une qualité supérieure grâce à la non-utilisation d’engrais et la culture en milieu fermé qui permet de maîtriser les intrants de la production.Pourquoi faire de l’aquaponie en ville?Rendement optimum de l’espaceSur des expériences existantes à travers le monde, on trouve une productivité de nourriture au m2 allant jusqu’à 250 kg par année.Faible consommation d’eauPar rapport à une culture en pleine terre, l’aquaponie engendre une économie d’eau de plus de 80 %.Pas d’apports chimiques extérieursIl s'agit d'un petit éco-système très sensibles à tout intrants extérieur; seul les engrais organiques tolérés dans la culture biologique peuvent être utilisée et ce avec parcimonie.Rejets de polluants quasi nulsLe traitement des déchets fécaux dans l'élevage de poissons est un vrai fléaux qui est encore peu traité. Selon Beth Hunter, coordonnatrice de la campagne Océans de Greenpeace, une ferme de 200 000 saumons libère une quantité de matières fécales «aussi importante que les nutriments rejetés dans les eaux usées d’une localité de 65 000 personnes».Péservation de la faune localeEn élevant les poissons dans des parcs clos tel que dans le modèle aquaponique on évite les risques de contamination du milieu sauvage.Adaptabilité des structures Un système aquaponique s’adapte à toutes les contraintes liées à l’espace, toit,  parking, balcon, trottoir….tous ces espaces stériles peuvent être repensés pour accueillir une culture aquaponique.LA MICRO FERME AQUAPONIQUENotre projet est de construire une vitrine sur l’aquaponie ouverte à tous au coeur même de Genève.Concrètement, le projet prendra la forme d’un espace de culture aquaponique éphémère. Cette micro-ferme d’environ 15m2 se composera d’un container coiffé d’une serre. Ce projet, pensé par la designer Damien Chivialle, a déjà été présenté dans de nombreuses villes européennes. Le container abritera une cuve pour l’élevage des poissons ainsi que le système technique composé d’une pompe et d’un filtre à sable. La serre qui accueillera les plantes sera reliée par un système de tuyaux au local technique et recevra ainsi l’eau souillée des poissons.Le laboratoire sera dans un premier temps installé sur le parking du Impact Hub Geneva, au 1 Rue Fendt, juste derrière la gare Cornavin.Sur une période d’exploitation de 6 mois, nous projetons une production de poissons et de légumes de respectivement 60kg et 120kg, sans chauffage ni lumière artificielle.Qu’est ce qu’on va offrir?La micro-ferme aquaponique sera accessible aux visiteurs, grands comme petits.Ils se verront présenter le système ainsi que les problématiques économiques, sociales et environnementales globale entourant le projet telles que:
L’autonomie alimentaire des villes
La construction d’un système alimentaire durable 
Les dégâts écologiques engendrés par la production alimentaire
L’importance du développement de production alimentaire en circuit court
Les défis autour d’un retour du rural au coeur des villes
