I am one of a group of seven University of South Dakota students that were selected to be a part of an event called The New York City Senior Showcase. What is this you ask? It is an opportunity for a select group of senior theatre majors to connect with industry professionals. We have the chance to attend workshops, network with professionals in theatre, and audition in front of agents to help us jump start our careers in theatre.

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>Hello! My name is Emmanuel and I am a tap dancer from San Diego. I began studying tap dance in college and fell in love with it. It is one of those things that is part of my soul. </p>
<p>I am campaigning through Indiegogo so that I can attend the Los Angeles Tap Festival in August. By doing so, I will be able to continue fostering my love for tap dance and pass it onto the students that I teach. </p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign, you will not just be sending a tap dancer to a random tap dance festival. You will be keeping the rich and decadent American art-form alive. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Prior to the tap festival, I will need to buy a new pair of tap shoes. The shoes that I plan on buying are called Capezio K360's--a high quality, professional style tap shoe. They are fashioned out of a men's oxford and cost $300.

</div></div>","Short Summary Hello! My name is Emmanuel and I am a tap dancer from San Diego. I began studying tap dance in college and fell in love with it. It is one of those things that is part of my soul. 
I am campaigning through Indiegogo so that I can attend the Los Angeles Tap Festival in August. By doing so, I will be able to continue fostering my love for tap dance and pass it onto the students that I teach. 
By contributing to this campaign, you will not just be sending a tap dancer to a random tap dance festival. You will be keeping the rich and decadent American art-form alive.    What We Need & What You Get Prior to the tap festival, I will need to buy a new pair of tap shoes. The shoes that I plan on buying are called Capezio K360's--a high quality, professional style tap shoe. They are fashioned out of a men's oxford and cost $300. After purchasing the shoes, I would have to take them to a cobbler who would stretch the shoes, build the shoes up, and then add the taps. That would cost about $100 dollars. 
Once buying the shoes, I'd sign up for the tap festival. There are four packages and I will be buying the package called Tap Enthusiast which is $150. It includes one class per day, one history class per day, and access to all the events. 
In addition to the package, I would like to buy a $35 ticket to the faculty concert that's held at the end of the week. Finally, there is a $25 non-refundable registration fee. The total would come to $210. 
The rest of the money would be used for gas :)

<h2>WHAT IS THIS?!</h2>
<p>Hello noice sleuths! Welcome to the crowd-fundraising page of <strong>Bloody Bloody Jessica Fletcher</strong>--a loving send-up of all things <i>Angela Lansbury</i> and <i>Murder, She Wrote</i>.  This original musical comedy is a one and half hour hilarious murder mystery all centered on that fictional Maine town we grew to love over 12 hit seasons--plus with a few exciting twists!  We're hoping to raise enough funds to produce a high quality two week staged reading of the show in New York City.  Please enjoy these highlights from our sold out concert at 54 Below: </p>

<p><b>Why Contribute to The

<p>I am Lilith Mesidor, and am a
senior Theatre and Performance major at Purchase College. For my final project,
I have decided to act in <i>The</i> <i>Chairs</i> by Eugene Ionesco, and can’t do
it without you!</p>
<p>A married couple prepares to
share their meaning of life while they scurry around waiting for their guests
to arrive, in what Ionesco described as a “tragic farce”.  Yet, the guests are not as
responsive as they expect…</p>
<p><b>The Significance</b></p>
<p>This is a new twist on a play
that is rarely performed by young actors. This production will bring one of
Ionesco’s lesser-known works to life to at Purchase College, and perhaps revive
an appreciation for an often-misunderstood genre of theatre. <i>The</i> <i>Chairs</i>
will be the everlasting stamp on my college career, and will prove that I am
capable of handling challenges put before me, despite its difficult language,
physicality, and mental state necessary for success. The definition of the
meaning of life and existentialism resonates more with age. For those of us who
will be stepping out into all walks of life at the end of this year, I hope to
charge that question by giving it more direction.</p>
<p><b>Why Is This So Important?</b></p>
<p>As my senior project, this show
is a culmination of everything I have gained in my undergraduate career. This is vital to my continued growth down a path of artistry that is often overlooked. By

together to follow their passion. You are also the reason why this production

<p><i>Versión en Castellano a continuación / Scroll down for Spanish version </i></p>
<p>Dear one!</p>
<p>I need your help to participate in a significant and unique experience.</p>
<p>My name is Nuria, I am a woman, a daughter and a young independent artist. But most of all I am a curious being, a creative soul and a creature whose interest in learning and expanding her consciousness goes beyond imagination.</p>
<p>This summer I want to attend Nancy Stark Smith and Mike Vargas dance event in Poland. A 10 days unique opportunity to explore Contact Improvisation dance, Contemplation and Composition.</p>
<p>Are you perhaps wondering what is Contact Improvisation? Or maybe who is Nancy Stark Smith and Mike Vargas? Or simply who am I?</p>
<p>Let me tell you about it!!!</p>
<p>First things first, let me introduce myself.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526786770/gs8ow6gnpgjakmbddevz.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>About me</strong>.</p>
<p>I was born in Spain but my roots are also connected to South America by having an Argentinian mother.</p>
<p>I moved to London, UK when I was 18 and came back to Spain after a while to reconsider my life. I am now developing my self and getting ready to move abroad once again to carry on with my work and studies.</p>
<p>I started dancing 3 years ago, when a life event offered me the possibility to start all over again and reconstruct myself. And that's when Contact Improvisation came to place.</p>
<p>Since an early age I've been curious about human behaviour and movement.</p>
<p>Artist Daniel Lepkoff translates into words my attraction to this practice by stating the following:</p>
<p><i>""In Contact Improvisation I can gather information through my physical senses directly from my environment, using my own powers of observation I can shift my perspective, have new perceptions and free myself from my own conventional/ habitual ways of seeing.""</i></p>
<p>In my opinion, having the attention on physicality reduces the intention of doing and increases the action of being.</p>
<p>By committing to this practice I encounter the possibility to empower myself and rely on my physical intelligence and to allow my mind to be questioned every time I move. Dance allows me to reconnect with the body's innate ability to move that we all have, and that it's most of the time repressed by social conditioning.</p>
<p><strong>About the practice.</strong></p>
<p>Contact Improvisation dates 1972 and is “an open-ended exploration of the kinaesthetic possibilities of bodies moving through contact. Sometimes wild and athletic, sometimes quiet and meditative, it is a form open to all bodies and enquiring minds.” (definition by Ray Chung)</p>
<p>If you want to know more about this dance technique you can explore this wonderful website: <a href=""https://contactquarterly.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://contactquarterly.com/</a></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526783969/zgnzdfqwswr4gvehzdkm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Why this campaign?</strong></p>
<p>I need your help to keep exploring this dance form!</p>
<p>At the moment Contact Improvisation is my core study as a dancer.</p>
<p>I am following a two years programme in Madrid: <a href=""http://www.espaciofci.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.espaciofci.com/</a></p>
<p>In order to keep deepening in this practice I would also like to attend an intensive workshop going on this summer with practitioners Nancy Stark Smith and Mike Vargas who come all the way from the States to Poland to share their dance improvisation work using Contact Improvisation as a base.</p>
<p>This includes Contact Improvisation technique and practice, improvisation scores, listening practice, compositional awareness, contemplative practice, jamming, and observing.</p>
<p>The workshop is called “States of grace” which they describe as what can happen when all the balls are in the air at once.</p>
<p>Through dancing, listening, and watching, we will study physical and energetic changes of state, natural composition, presence, and relationship—in groups, solo, in and out of contact, in silence and with live music.</p>
<p><i>“Knowing, not knowing. Doing, not doing. Making choices. Humanity.”</i></p>
<p><strong>This experience will help me to get closer to my dream: to introduce Contact Improvisation in different social contexts, such as environments with young people suffering from behavioural problems.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For me, human behaviour has a big impact on the environment. Therefore it is my wish to contribute to humanity by helping young people to know themselves better and interact with the world in a healthy way.</strong></p>

Dear one!
I need your help to participate in a significant and unique experience.
My name is Nuria, I am a woman, a daughter and a young independent artist. But most of all I am a curious being, a creative soul and a creature whose interest in learning and expanding her consciousness goes beyond imagination.
This summer I want to attend Nancy Stark Smith and Mike Vargas dance event in Poland. A 10 days unique opportunity to explore Contact Improvisation dance, Contemplation and Composition.
Are you perhaps wondering what is Contact Improvisation? Or maybe who is Nancy Stark Smith and Mike Vargas? Or simply who am I?
Let me tell you about it!!!
First things first, let me introduce myself.

About me.
I was born in Spain but my roots are also connected to South America by having an Argentinian mother.
I moved to London, UK when I was 18 and came back to Spain after a while to reconsider my life. I am now developing my self and getting ready to move abroad once again to carry on with my work and studies.
I started dancing 3 years ago, when a life event offered me the possibility to start all over again and reconstruct myself. And that's when Contact Improvisation came to place.
Since an early age I've been curious about human behaviour and movement.
Artist Daniel Lepkoff translates into words my attraction to this practice by stating the following:
""In Contact Improvisation I can gather information through my physical senses directly from my environment, using my own powers of observation I can shift my perspective, have new perceptions and free myself from my own conventional/ habitual ways of seeing.""
In my opinion, having the attention on physicality reduces the intention of doing and increases the action of being.
By committing to this practice I encounter the possibility to empower myself and rely on my physical intelligence and to allow my mind to be questioned every time I move. Dance allows me to reconnect with the body's innate ability to move that we all have, and that it's most of the time repressed by social conditioning.
About the practice.
Contact Improvisation dates 1972 and is “an open-ended exploration of the kinaesthetic possibilities of bodies moving through contact. Sometimes wild and athletic, sometimes quiet and meditative, it is a form open to all bodies and enquiring minds.” (definition by Ray Chung)
If you want to know more about this dance technique you can explore this wonderful website: https://contactquarterly.com/

Why this campaign?
I need your help to keep exploring this dance form!
At the moment Contact Improvisation is my core study as a dancer.
I am following a two years programme in Madrid: http://www.espaciofci.com/
In order to keep deepening in this practice I would also like to attend an intensive workshop going on this summer with practitioners Nancy Stark Smith and Mike Vargas who come all the way from the States to Poland to share their dance improvisation work using Contact Improvisation as a base.
This includes Contact Improvisation technique and practice, improvisation scores, listening practice, compositional awareness, contemplative practice, jamming, and observing.
The workshop is called “States of grace” which they describe as what can happen when all the balls are in the air at once.
Through dancing, listening, and watching, we will study physical and energetic changes of state, natural composition, presence, and relationship—in groups, solo, in and out of contact, in silence and with live music.
“Knowing, not knowing. Doing, not doing. Making choices. Humanity.”
This experience will help me to get closer to my dream: to introduce Contact Improvisation in different social contexts, such as environments with young people suffering from behavioural problems.
For me, human behaviour has a big impact on the environment. Therefore it is my wish to contribute to humanity by helping young people to know themselves better and interact with the world in a healthy way.
If you resonate with this longing to change the world by creating small changes in education and social inclusion this is your chance to create a big impact on someone's life!
The best way to contribute is by making a financial contribution!
My target for this campaign is 1000€.
Your contribution would help me to pay for some essential expenses of this experience:
625€ destined to cover the fee of the intensive workshop and 275€ for travel costs. The rest of the money raised will help cover the fee taken by Indiegogo.

is created collectively by theatre artists
Sasa Brown, Emelia Symington Fedy, Jody Kay Marklew, Sonja Bennett
and Juno Rinaldi.


Placing a dark lens on a new generation of moms we are taking our candid conversations from playgrounds into the public format. Using the strength of simple storytelling we talk pointedly about postpartum depression, shameful personal regressions and the hilarity that goes along with joining the world’s biggest club.


Premiering
at The Cultch in January 2015 this show has the potential for great success. The snag is- BC
Arts Council and The City of Vancouver don’t fund new collectives. Because our funding opportunities are severly limited across Canada we have to rely on donor and sponsorship support. 
That means you!
Creation begins December 9th
2013.




While we are all committed to working for free for the first two week creation period we do need to raise money to pay for childcare for our 8 children and a rehearsal space. 



*We
need to raise $4900 by
December 1st
2013 or this project will not move into phase 2 of creation. 
We need your help!

 This is a show for everyone. Possibly because it’s hilarious and charged with real life stories and

will work for free but we need someone to watch the kids!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Erin Wotherspoon. I am a George Brown Theatre school graduate and an aspiring writer. I have been involved in the arts most of my life and continue too pursue this dream in spite of constant financial uncertainty and crippling student debts. A theatre school colleague and myself have just finished writing what will be our first full-length play. This campaign I've created is to raise money so we can afford a venue for our show. We hope to raise enough money so we can afford to rent the venue for more than one night allowing our show to reach a wider audience. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Our aim is around $1000 give or take more or less. Regardless of how little or much money we get we will be going through with the project, as we believe in the quality of the script. It is simple, if we don't make much money we will probably end up doing the play in a coffee shop, with no lights, no sound, or any kind of props. If we do reach our goal or exceed it we will be able too pick a venue more suitable for theatrics and luxuriate in props and costumes and maybe even a sound cue or two.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>""In a world of lies, roommates Deb &amp; Nico set sail for the truth."" An artist is in (or should be in) a constant pursuit of truth, while the rest of the world has cashed in for security and financial stability, the artist can be over-looked as childish or flat out failures in societies like ours where money is next too godliness. But without the truth, our sense of humanity &amp; often humour can become lost. THE TRUTH HURTS but it doesn't always have too, donate ANYTHING and you will be enabling our dream of truthful expression. Thank you so much.<br/>

<h2>Our Journey</h2>

<p>After putting the scene up, Kevin offhandedly said, “We should do this show.” Freddy responded by getting in touch with The Miller Estate (he had been a volunteer in Rebecca Miller’s NYU Film class eight years ago.)

Be careful what you wish for!<br/><br/>Kevin McCorkle is a seasoned veteran actor, as well as a cancer survivor.  While working on the scene with Freddy, he realized DEATH OF A SALESMAN mirrors many of his personal life experiences, including his close brush with death and the arc of nearly every actor’s career path. Enter Willy Loman.<br/><br/>Freddy is a single dad from New York, trying to make it here in the City of Angels.  His goal is to provide the best possible life for his family.  DEATH OF A SALESMAN is an important step towards his Hollywood dreams.

First, acclaimed actress Jules Bruff signed on to play Willy’s wife, Linda Loman, and help produce.  Courtney King jumped on as a producer, and Joey Langella welcomed the role of social media coordinator.  And then, they were fortunately able to lock down award-winning director Bjorn Johnson to helm the show.  We’ll keep you posted as new actors and crew members come on board.<br/><br/>The show is set to open on April 5th at the SECRET ROSE THEATRE in North Hollywood.  We have a long way to go in order to bring DEATH OF A SALESMAN to life.

</div>","***UPDATE***
We have been overwhelmed by the generosity of our donors and the momentum of this campaign.  We are thrilled to have reached our preliminary online goal so soon.  The entire budget for LAKE WATER is over $18,000.  Our online campaign will only cover a fraction of this.  We would love to continue raising as much money as we can until the online campaign ends on August 15.  This will increase our ability to market and advertise the play and provide much needed resources for our amazing design team. Thank you for spreading the word and helping bring LAKE WATER to the stage!

Who We Are
Hey! It's Troy Deutsch.
I'm excited to talk to you about my new play LAKE WATER. I have
assembled a team of amazingly talented and passionate collaborators,
including my director Daniel Talbott, producer Amanda Feldman, and a group of
indie theater rockstar designers... truly my dream team.  We are so happy
to be bringing LAKE WATER to IRT Theater in the West Village this fall. 
Our Story

The video above is
footage of my hometown:  New Prague, Minnesota, a small rural Czech and
German farming community on the outskirts of Minneapolis. It is a beautiful,
peaceful town, but i found the experience of growing up there to be, at times,
terribly lonely and isolating, as it is for many teenagers who feel
""different"" or are questioning their sexuality, as I once was.   
On a visit home a few
years ago, I found a poem my little sister Greta had written for a high school
writing assignment about all of the young people committing suicide or
dying in accidents in our town with one stoplight.  My sister doesn't claim
to be a writer, but her poem impacted me deeply:

Are we being haunted?
Is there a burden on
our small town?
Why are there so many
deaths of all these innocent people?
Are there hidden
predicaments?
Or are we under a
curse?  Or spell?  Or jinx?  Or plague?
Is there something
eerie about New Prague that makes young people surrender?
Why are we wiping away
all of our tears?
When will this horror
expire?

Tears filled my eyes.
 I was numb.  I was grateful to my sister for her poem, for giving
voice to something that had been swirling inside my head for years.  Then
she told me about a few of the local teen suicides that had occurred since I
left town.  These stories, compounded by my sister’s poem, and my own
experience of growing up isolated and questioning my sexuality, inspired me to
finally start writing the play.
LAKE WATER follows two small town high school seniors, Iris and
James, who become estranged after their best friend suddenly commits suicide.
Then one “crapping pathetic Friday night,” James calls Iris in distress, and
she meets him at the lake.  Out on a dock, surrounded by green water, the
two friends untangle the painful events of their past and struggle to face the
limits of their lives.  LAKE WATER is a two-person 80-minute play
with one set and no intermission. Full of humor and hope, the play sheds
some light on an all-too-common small town American tragedy. 

The Impact
LAKE WATER is a deeply personal play for me.  And with
the rash of teen suicides in the news, especially amongst isolated LGBT youth,
the story of LAKE WATER feels particularly timely and urgently
needed. We hope to bring this play not only to regular theatergoers, but
to reach the LGBT youth who might benefit most from this story.  We plan on
reaching out to PFLAG and local LGBT youth groups in an effort to start a
dialogue, to give voice to the voiceless, and, ultimately, bring about healing.
What We Need & What
You Get
Thanks to a number of
generous foundations we have already raised more than half of the money we need
to produce the play. Your donation will help pay for the set, the theatre rental, our press agent and numerous other
expenses associated with producing a world premiere production in NYC. In
exchange for your donation, we're offering a number of thank you gifts... My
mom sure can't wait to share her Minnesotan recipes with ya!
 
Other Ways You Can Help
In addition to your
donation, we can use your help to spread the word. So please mention us on
facebook, tweet about us, and let your friends know about LAKE WATER.
 And if you know someone who you think might benefit from seeing a story
like this on stage, please bring them to the play.  LAKE WATER will
tell them to hang on, and that it does, indeed, get better.
 
We thank you in advance
for your generosity. 
See you at the theater in

<p>Music on Stage is a community of performers, musicians, artisans, designers and volunteers dedicated to the preservation and development of community theatre. We are proud to provide a live orchestra to support the volunteer cast and crew for our musical theatre performances at our home at Cutting Hall, in Palatine, Illinois.</p>
<p>A strongly committed, hard-working, volunteer Board has managed the affairs of Music on Stage since its inception. These talented individuals are young, old, men women, teachers, office managers, artists and lawyers -- a true microcosm of the community. Some Board members regularly perform on stage; most choose to be involved only behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Cutting Hall, a facility of the Palatine Park District, has been home to Music on Stage productions since 1979. The air conditioned 441-seat theatre boasts a spacious 36-foot proscenium stage and floor-level orchestra pit.</p>
<p>Music on Stage has provided the northwest suburbs of Chicago with quality community theatre for over 50 years! We have done so as a 501(c) nonprofit corporation.</p>
<h3>The Show</h3>
<p><em>The Pajama Game</em> is a musical based on the novel <em>71/2 Cents</em>, written by Richard Bissell, which was made into a movie directed by Richard Abbott. A workplace romance between Babe Williams, the leader of the union grievance committee and Sid Sorkin, the new superintendent is complicated by a workers' strike at the Sleep-Tite Pajama Factory. The beautiful score, written by Richard Adler and Jerry Ross, includes <em>Steam Heat</em>, <em>Hey There</em> and <em>Hernando's Hideaway</em>, which have become musical theatre repertoire standards.</p>
<p>(Source: MTI - <a href=""http://www.MTIShows.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.MTIShows.com</a>)</p>
<h3>The Vision; Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>Funds pledged would help to pay for advertising and costume needs for our production of the Pajama Game. In a tough economy, and with limited budgets, our production team has become very creative in cutting production costs while still providing a professional grade show. One area that continues to provide a challenge is advertising costs. As a community theatre company with a community theatre budget, our biggest challenge has been to afford the advertising we desperately need to let theatregoers know about our show. Outside of word-of-mouth, putting up posters in the community and sharing links on social media links, all other advertising costs money, be it newspaper, radio or television.</p>
<p>Your help would allow our advertising reach expand to neighboring communities as well as to Chicago-based communities for a three-week run, plus preview.</p>
<p>In addition, while this show has a smaller cast, it has a daunting costume requirement, with multiple costume changes for each cast member throughout the show. Your help would help defray the costs of costuming a cast of twenty.</p>
<p>Our experienced, dedicated and creative director and production team will ensure that every pledge is properly allocated. With your help, we can see this production achieve its highest potential and allow this classic comedy, with its talented cast and crew, garner the exposure it deserves!</p>
<p>Should we be fortunate to meet our goal, we encourage additional pledges ti enhance other areas of the production. We have the talent and commitment of our cast and crew of volunteers...the final component of meeting our budgeting needs can be met with the generous support of people who enjoy live theatre -- people like you!</p>
<h3>Rewards</h3>
<p>Music on Stage would be very appreciative and grateful for every pledge. As a 501(c) nonprofit corporation, your pledge would be tax deductible commensurate with the reward tier and as allowable by law. Please review the specific reward tiers provided as our thanks to you.</p>

</div></div>","This fall, our theatre company is embarking on our most exciting and ambitious project to date, “Hotel Suite” and we need to Raise $5,500 in order to secure a performance venue. “Hotel Suite” is an exciting, ground breaking, immersive and site specific 21-day theatrical event featuring the work of 8 directors, 8 playwrights, 20 actors and an immensely talented design and support team.  This project includes the celebrated works of Sam Shepherd and the first Off-Off Broadway production of Bug by Tracy Letts, along with 6 brand new one act plays.   Our show will run for 3 weeks between October 4th and November 18th, 2012.  The fourth wall will be broken and the audience will step inside the “hotel room” filled with stories and experiences.  These traditional plays have never been performed in this way and we look forward to sharing a different way of storytelling.  Audience and characters will collide during the course of each show’s performance, allowing viewers to be a part of the story.Thinking about this concept for several years, our Artistic Director, Akia, feels we finally have the right combination of talent, history and circumstance to make this project a reality.  After several attempts over the past few years to obtain rights to Tracy Letts play, Bug, Rising Sun Performance Company will be the first Off-Off Broadway company to present this play in NYC since its original Off Broadway run!  So, all of the pieces have fallen into place - an amazing group of directors, playwrights, actors and collaborators.  THIS IS the team to make this project happen, BUT WE NEED YOUR HELP to get there!  We are looking for a raw loft space, hotel suite, connecting hotel rooms or a large hotel room that could hold an intimate performance for 10-20 people at a time. We have several exciting leads but we need to be able to pay for the space in order to move forward.  Here is where you get to be a part of the show! With each donation a “virtual” new room is added to our “Hotel Suite” with your name on it. You decide which room you want to help us  build!See the sidebar for the AWESOME PERKS starting with just a $10 DONATION!The most important element besides the cool perks, is the impact of having your money support local independent theatre in a very real way.  You could be a part of an exciting theatrical event and a leader in supporting art on a grassroots level.Rising Sun Performance Company is a vital part of the Off-Off Broadway landscape; being one of the longest running ensemble companies at our producing level in NYC.  Established in 2001, we are a small but prolific non-profit theatre company, having produced over 50 productions and events both locally and nationally. Check out our website www.risinsunnyc.com for more information about us.We bring to this project our long history of collaboration, existing audience, established reputation, enthusiastic energy and exciting quality work.  We feel confident that when we hit our IndieGoGo Campaign Goal, this production will be our best yet!  BUT it’s still A LONG WAY off from happening.  If we don’t reach our goal, we will have to postpone the production.   PLEASE HELP OUR ARTISTS BRING THEIR WORK TO LIFE!$5,000 is just the first step, and that will only cover our performance venue.What we have in place:Brilliant PlaywrightsKiller DesignersTop Notch DirectorsBreathtaking Actorsand 3 great spaces to rehearse in (THANKS TO THE FIELD, HORSE TRADE & SPACE ON WHITE!)What we need:$5,000 for our venue to perform$1,800 for Royalty Rights for Fool for Love & Bug$2,000 to Pay our Designers & Stage Managers$1,500 for our Set, Props & Costumes$1,500 for additional rehearsal space$1,000 for sound, lighting & visual technologyBe a part of our collective history and give “Hotel Suite” a home!

<p>My name is Yvonne Montoya. I am a mother, dancer/choreographer, and the MPA project (a dance film, blog, and earring collection) is my first ever solo project; a project seven years in the making.</p>
<p>The Motherhood and the Performing Arts (MPA) Project was born out of my desire to dedicate more of my time and energies to my son. Last year, w<span style=""background-color: initial;"">hile neck deep into a multi-year, multi-faceted visual and performing arts project with a heavy community engagement component, I realized I had dedicated a large amount of my life to growing and nurturing a company, frequently at the expense of quality time I could have spent with my son. Both my son and my company are seven years old.  I decided then that I would take a break from my company and create work centered around my son and my role as a mother. Thus was born the MPA project. This project is a reflection of the challenges and joys of juggling motherhood and a career in the performing arts.</span></p>
<ul> </ul> <p></p>
<p><i>The MPA project has three main components:</i></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">A dance film that will be shot in the marginal and, often intimate, spaces where my career and role as a mother brush up against each other.</span><br/>
</li>

</ol> </div> <div> <h3>I Need Your Help!</h3> <ul> <li>This project needs at least $900 to cover the production costs of the dance film that is scheduled to be shot on location the third week of April 2016. </li> <li>In the case that the goal is not reached, all donations will still go towards the production costs for the dance film.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Take home YOUR Piece of the MPA Project!!</h3>
<div><ul>
<li>Did I mention the earring collection? That is the part of the MPA Project that is specifically for YOU! All earrings in the collection are available by donation to the project.

<li>All earrings are HANDMADE (by me!), UP CYCLED, and approved by my son! </li>
<li>Check it out and donate today!</li>
</ul></div>
<h3>The Impact</h3> <p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">This project is important because there is an under representation of artist mothers and artist parents creating work both in the performing arts and in the art world in general. The world needs art created by people who are raising and have raised children! </span><br/></p>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">I chose to do this project as a dance film because the project will have a life beyond the performance and can be shared with different communities of working mothers, working parents, and working artists.

<div>And because Indiegogo is asking me to say this, I have six years experience successfully directing and producing performing arts projects (site-specific and site-adaptive work, work with a large community engagement component, and the regular old dance-in-a-theater productions).

We need your support to make this show happen!</p><p><strong>Overview</strong></p><p>Sips &amp; Scripts invites you to the first fully staged production of The Waning Hours by local playwright Carol Torian! This September, Alzheimer’s takes center stage in a play about Lorna Bray Tucker, a woman who is losing her grip on reality due to the disease. Lorna is present, yet absent as her memories become tangled and lost, and those closest to her struggle to come to terms with what is happening.  </p><p><strong>The Story</strong></p><p>After more than four decades of marriage, Lorna Bray Tucker’s husband Bernard leaves her for a younger lover. Lorna is still reeling from the divorce when she starts down a path of irreversible memory loss. Once an aspiring singer and amateur photographer, she now drifts between the present day and the past as her mind is ravaged by worsening Alzheimer’s disease. Her long-time housekeeper Madeline bears the brunt of Lorna’s frustrations and quarrelsome ways, while the disease threatens to physically and emotionally overwhelm her son Arlo. Lorna’s forgetfulness and dementia also offer a glimpse of her younger self. Through vivid hallucinations, a  22-year-old Lorna emerges. She is fresh from the South and living in 1960s civil rights era Philadelphia. Lorna works a thankless job at the phone company and forms a singing group with her roommates. The trio is enamored of Diana Ross and The Supremes, and longs to appear on stage at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. Unfortunately, their lazy manager only books seedy nightclub gigs. Most of which pay little or nothing at all. Yearning for more, a talented, idealistic and naïve Lorna pieces together a life of hopes and dreams that slowly unravel over the years, bringing her to this moment.</p><p>Featuring an African-American cast and directed by Terra Hodge, The Waning Hours is a series of vignettes that attempt to mirror the thought process of someone who is suffering from moderate Alzheimer’s disease. The play is set entirely in Lorna's kitchen—the one place in a house where time matters most. And it here that we discover the songs that serve as an enduring reminder of who Lorna once was and who she might have become if she'd made different choices. This emotionally-charged play is tinged with disappointment and loss, but  woven with hints of humor, drawing us deeper and deeper into Lorna's mind.  </p><p><strong>Check out the special PERKS for your chance to meet the cast and crew, and name-a-seat, grab a magazine subscription, take a photography lesson and more... You may need to click the reward square to see the full contents.

In most people with the disease—those with the late-onset type—symptoms first appear in their mid-60s. Early-onset Alzheimer’s occurs between a person’s 30s and mid-60s and is very rare. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia among older adults.

More than 16 million Americans provide unpaid care for people with Alzheimer’s or other dementias. The Alzheimer’s journey is unique for every family, and while there is currently no cure for the disease, research continues.</p><p><strong>Did you know?...

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Here's the deal, this would me so much to us. We've done shows for 3 people in empty hostels and shows for 100+ in packed auditoriums. We've met women around the country who have said watching us perform inspired them to keep going, to try improv, or just be louder on and off stage. We support each other, love each other, and even give wedding toasts. We want to bring the heat to Scotland, and show folks that strong women also make strong improvisers.</p>
<p>It's what Del Close would have wanted.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We're going to Scotland. The risk is, will we go broke on the way. Also here's a list of risks I wrote that are honest and true to Dangerfield:</p>
<ul>
<li>Will Amy micromanage all travel until she resents the rest of the group?</li>
<li>Will Jen be too tall to fit in Scottish Air Bnbs?</li>
<li>Will Kristina give a compelling enough Spokane speech?</li>
<li>Will Francesca have the opportunity to play a convincing little boy?</li>
<li>Will Mina remember her passport?</li>
<li>Will Ashley meet a single, sexy Scottish man? Will we film a Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen style movie about their budding relationship?</li>

DeSalva, a recent law school graduate. While in law school, I became a
certified sexual assault counselor, working on a 24-hour hotline and as a
hospital advocate. Over the past two years, I have worked with numerous victims
even crossing over into human trafficking, and what I have realized is the lack
of education that surrounds these topics. Due to the federal budget cuts, the
non-profit organization, I volunteer with is going to lose its ENTIRE education

taking action by putting together an entire production of The Vagina Monologues, as a fundraiser to save
the program! What began as an individual mission, has turned into a
group effort of other concerned community members to help with this effort.   WE have an entire cast of 18 ladies ready to perform, a
venue, professional printing, and production crew ready! However, we are
starting at a ZERO budget and we need your help to offset costs! I invite you
all to be part of this change, to end sexual violence. 

We are raising money to host the Vagina Monologues
on Friday, April 25th and Saturday, April 26th at The
Frida Cinema as a larger fundraiser for Sexual Assault Victims' Services
(SAVS), a branch of Community Service Programs' (CSP). SAVS serves as the one and
only rape crisis center for Orange County. In addition to serving as advocates
for victims in the courthouse, at the DA's office, in the hospital and on the
hotline, SAVS also operates a prevention and education program. This program serves to
help decrease sexual violence in the
community and increase awareness. 
 WHY
WE ARE HOSTING THE VAGINA MONOLOGUES 
SAVS just received awful news that their prevention
program will not be funded next year! SAVS gets a large portion of its funding
from the federal government and one important use of this funding has been to
educate middle school, high school, and college students throughout Orange
County about sexual violence under their prevention program. Due to various
budget cuts from the federal government, SAVS will not have the crucial funding

middle and high school students across Orange County will not receive valuable
information about an important topic that affects ALL people. Knowledge is
power and everyone deserves to be informed, especially in regards to their
personal safety and the safety of those they know and love. 
To help SAVS maintain their
prevention program we are hosting the Vagina Monologues, an episodic play
written by Eve Ensler about the experiences of women. The Vagina Monologues
consists of about 20 different monologues covering topics from childbirth and
menstruation to consensual sex and rape; it is a roller coaster of emotions
that range from funny to sad, but all together inspiring and eye opening. By
hosting this event we hope to raise money to keep the prevention program open while
increasing awareness, creating a sense of community and utilizing the arts as a
medium of liberation and a vehicle of change. The Vagina Monologues is a part
of the larger V-Day movement which is a global non-profit started and ran by
Eve Ensler, herself. All of the proceeds from these productions will go
directly to the cause. The first 90% will go to our local beneficiary, SAVS, and the remainder will go to the umbrella organization, V-Day. 
In addition to the play, each production will incorporate visual arts, culinary arts, and the business
community. Visual art will be displayed at the productions and a silent auction
will be held for the pieces. Culinary arts will be celebrated through food and
drinks available during the event. Finally, supportive members of the business
community will be on site with products for purchase. 
 WHY PREVENTION AND EDUCATION IS
NECESSARY 
Current statistics suggest that 1
in 4 women will be sexually assaulted in her lifetime. While this statistic
points to the importance of prevention and education to increase the well-being
of women, men are also impacted by sexual violence, both as victims and as friends,
relatives, and partners of women. The issue of sexual violence is relevant to
all communities and happens among individuals of any socioeconomic status,
race, religion, and culture with devastating effects on individuals, families
and communities. This is an issue that is receiving national attention; the
Centers for Disease Control declared the issue of sexual violence a public
health epidemic due to its widespread nature and devastating effects. The
physical, emotional, spiritual, and mental pain, is too high. 
SAVS education and prevention program
speaks in almost every high school district in OC to talk about topics
including but not limited to: cyber crimes (internet predators & sexting),
sexual assault prevention, bystander intervention, stalking and healthy
relationships. The program alters the above presentation to best fit the
intended audience, whether it be high school students, at risk youth (i.e. LGBT
teens, teens in a shelter, etc), college students, law enforcement,
professionals, parents, and more. The program does hundreds of presentations a
year to thousands of individuals. This program also contains Orange County’s
Clothesline Project which as over 800+ t-shirts from survivors of violent crimes
in Orange County (homicide, Human trafficking, sexual assault, domestic
violence, etc). 
These survivors need to feel loved,
treasured and valued, for many SAVS provides assistance down this path. Without
the validation and support they need and deserve, these people are more likely
to experience other problems ranging from eating disorders to post traumatic
stress disorder and so much more. 
WHAT WE
NEED 
Our goal of $7000 is set to cover the costs of putting this
production on 3 times in one weekend! This money will cover costs such as:
venue rental, stage lighting, light and sound crew, printing, food and
beverage, technical support and more. All proceeds above production costs will
be donated directly to SAVS and V-Day. 
Please take a moment to donate so we
are able to host this production for the entire Orange County community! Please
share this link with everyone you know, feel free to use the Indiegogo share
tools! Help put a stop to this horrible crime and increase awareness. Every
little bit helps and gets us one step closer to being able to put on this show
and more importantly, keep the prevention program open!
Then come join us at the show and have a good laugh and learn with us!LIKE us on FaceBook:https://www.facebook.com/VDAYOCFor more information please visit our website: http://www.vdayoc.com

Claire Stukel was brutal attacked.  When she wrongly identified the

all that she believes, including how to raise her son, Justin.  But as
Claire struggles to forgive herself, the past comes back to victimize her anew,

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>""Coming: A Rock Musical of Biblical Proportions"" is a new work of musical theatre by playwright/composer Erik Ransom. It premiered in Philadelphia at The Prince Music Theatre under the direction of Mark A. Dahl and Bill Egan of the Traverse Arts Project. ""Coming"" enjoyed a sold-out run with universal praise from local and national press, including The Huffington Post, the Philadelphia Inquirer and The Edge Media Network. Our brief run, had audience members coming back up to 6 times, and scalpers outside the theatre on closing weekend! Now, with the support of Philadelphia's Barrymore Award-Winning Brat Productions, ""Coming"" is looking to take Manhattan! Under the direction of acclaimed director Madi DiStefano, ""Coming"" will be showcased for Broadway and Off-Broadway investors at the beginning of 2012, with the goal of opening the show for a commercial Off-Broadway run later that year. In addition to our Philadelphia team, ""Coming"" is now being supported enthusiastically by New York's own Brierpatch Productions and is being represented by The Pepper Law Group. We have a stellar team and a realistic business plan in the works, and we need support!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Recently we acquired a $7500 grant from the very generous Wyncote Foundation, which challenged us to raise a matching amount on our own! We need support from friends and fans like yourselves to match Wyncote and get to our goal budget!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In addition to being an entertaining piece of theatre, (""Bold, campy, glam fun"", according the Toby Zinman of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">The Philadelphia Inquire</span>r) ""Coming"" has proven to be a very moving, thought-provoking play for many different kinds of people young and old, ranging from self-identified Christians to ardent atheists and everything in between. In spite of its irreverent sense of humor, ""Coming"" takes all sides of the age old religious arguments very seriously, and has been able to do so in a way that is both entertaining and moving. If you're not sure, check out our press!<br/></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to show New York that we have a viable, marketable show for their commercial audiences! So, we're renting a theatre space, hiring a band, bringing together some top-notch Equity and Non-Equity actors, and putting on a basic version of the show for potential investors who might want to take a chance on our daring story. Obviously, with this happening in New York, even a small presentation like this is an expensive endeavor. We want to do this right, and that means money! We're looking for financial support on all levels!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>

</div></div>","Our Story
""Coming: A Rock Musical of Biblical Proportions"" is a new work of musical theatre by playwright/composer Erik Ransom. It premiered in Philadelphia at The Prince Music Theatre under the direction of Mark A. Dahl and Bill Egan of the Traverse Arts Project. ""Coming"" enjoyed a sold-out run with universal praise from local and national press, including The Huffington Post, the Philadelphia Inquirer and The Edge Media Network. Our brief run, had audience members coming back up to 6 times, and scalpers outside the theatre on closing weekend! Now, with the support of Philadelphia's Barrymore Award-Winning Brat Productions, ""Coming"" is looking to take Manhattan! Under the direction of acclaimed director Madi DiStefano, ""Coming"" will be showcased for Broadway and Off-Broadway investors at the beginning of 2012, with the goal of opening the show for a commercial Off-Broadway run later that year. In addition to our Philadelphia team, ""Coming"" is now being supported enthusiastically by New York's own Brierpatch Productions and is being represented by The Pepper Law Group. We have a stellar team and a realistic business plan in the works, and we need support!

Recently we acquired a $7500 grant from the very generous Wyncote Foundation, which challenged us to raise a matching amount on our own! We need support from friends and fans like yourselves to match Wyncote and get to our goal budget!


The Impact
In addition to being an entertaining piece of theatre, (""Bold, campy, glam fun"", according the Toby Zinman of The Philadelphia Inquirer) ""Coming"" has proven to be a very moving, thought-provoking play for many different kinds of people young and old, ranging from self-identified Christians to ardent atheists and everything in between. In spite of its irreverent sense of humor, ""Coming"" takes all sides of the age old religious arguments very seriously, and has been able to do so in a way that is both entertaining and moving. If you're not sure, check out our press!
""Coming"" in The Huffington Post
""Coming"" on The Edge
""Coming"" in The Art Blog

What We Need & What You Get
Our goal is to show New York that we have a viable, marketable show for their commercial audiences! So, we're renting a theatre space, hiring a band, bringing together some top-notch Equity and Non-Equity actors, and putting on a basic version of the show for potential investors who might want to take a chance on our daring story. Obviously, with this happening in New York, even a small presentation like this is an expensive endeavor. We want to do this right, and that means money! We're looking for financial support on all levels!

We know it's tough out there, right now, but if everyone on the fan page alone can spare just $10 (Less than a single martini or glass of wine in many places!), we will be well on our way to our goal!

We're bringing our considerable artistic resources to bear on <strong>4th Tap Brewing Co-op (10615 Metric Blvd, Austin, TX) </strong>-- converting their warehouse area into a FULL NEON RODEO! What does that mean, even? Well, you can expect horses, cacti, tumbleweeds, covered wagons, varmints, and plenty of  buckaroos rendered into a vibrant, immersive dayglow, starlit  landscape that you can live in on <strong>March 14th, from 6:30 to midnight!</strong><br/><br/>There, PWR's patented blend of absurdist comedy, violent spectacle and weirdly-vulnerable performance will manifest like never before.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What is this money used for?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>$6000 is a lot of money! What’s it going toward?</p>
<p>First, an important recitation: PWR's quarterly Austin shows are free. PWR is for everyone, even if they can't afford to pay cover at a show. We'd like to keep from having to charge admission for as long as we can.</p>
<p>PWR is also now a 80-person organization putting on one of the largest free events in Texas. Increased expectations beget increased (and wholly worthwhile) costs: we spend north of $10,000 on each of our shows.</p>
<p>We diligently budget and carefully save so that we can ask for an amount that is sustainable. We are continuously able to improve the show and make it grander; our rigorous planning -- combined with your support -- have allowed us to do this without our costs ballooning to a hellish degree! It's all on the backs of our beautiful volunteers who submit themselves to the Multiverse out of love. We've survived more than five years as we've grown into the massive wrestling party you know today—and we're not slowing down! Accept no impostors! HELL RIGHT</p>
<p>Some of the cool things your donations will help us do include:</p>
<p><strong>Art and design.</strong> We have an extremely talented team of designers who transform the venue into an art piece by using garbage.  4th Tap Brewing Co-Op is about to get jammed with tumbleweed mirrorglobes and laser cacti. Though most of our resources are scavenged from trash bins and thrift stores, filling a venue of our size with cool decorations—and the storage to keep them preserved show after show!—costs money.</p>
<p><strong>Air Conditioning.</strong> We're budgeting to get coolers, just in case it gets hot outside! You know how Texas is.</p>
<p><strong>Paying artists.</strong> We work hard to make sure everyone who contributes to our production gets some money in exchange—whether our art team, our powerful tech wizards, or our A/V crew.</p>
<p><strong>Safer space/security.</strong> PWR is a party for everyone. Our performers have always followed anti-sexist/homophobic/transphobic/racist guidelines, and we wanted to make sure that comfort extends to our audience. We’re proud of our security phone line. Any member of the audience may use this number to report gross behavior at the show, and we resolve the problem. Your support lets us keep reaching toward a goal of ULTIMATE PARTY VIOLENCE for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Projection and lighting.</strong> PWR has some of the most advanced lighting for an independent wrestling show in the country! And we built it ourselves, with your help. We always have tweaks to make to reach towards our goal of TV-quality lighting. If you saw our lights at the last show, you know how shockingly powerful our latest generation is! Also, our projection system allows people to watch the show from 3 different places in the venue, each with different sitting and standing options! Plus, we now STREAM our shows over twitch, and your support helps us improve the quality of it.</p>
<p><strong>Training.</strong> Party Violence is its own unique sport. We have crafted a training program that makes use of experienced pro-wrestling coaching to help keep our PARTY ATHLETES smooth n' safe.  </p>
<p><strong>Profit split.</strong> after we cover all our costs, we take 20% of our profits and reinvest it in PWR. We split up whatever is left among performers and staff who worked on the show.</p>
<p>For transparency: this Indiegogo doesn’t cover all of adolescent PWR’s expenses, but it takes care of a big chunk of them. Below is our complete operational budget.</p>
<p><strong>Show Expenses: $2515.00:</strong><br/><br/>Art Supplies: $400.00<br/>Equipment Rental and Accessories (AC units, Video/Sound, Generators, etc): $600<br/>Construction Supplies: $50<br/>Insurance: $455.00<br/>Performer Assistance Fund: $200.00<br/>Ring/Facilities Maintenance: $175.00<br/>Office Supplies: $30.00<br/>Props/Costume: $75.00<br/>Security Phone: $60.00<br/>Transportation: $400.00<br/>Service Subscriptions: $70<br/><br/><strong>Operational Expenses: $4470:</strong><br/><br/>Artist and Staff Pay: $4070<br/>New Projects Capital: $400.00<br/><br/><strong>Indiegogo Reward production and fulfillment: $2960<br/>Indiegogo and credit card fees: $550</strong></p>

<br/><br/>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>As PWR continues its evolution from backyard party to professional art-collective, we never want to lose the heart of partying and stupidness that makes it good. We aim to balance a relentless work ethic with a light touch and and inviting environment for our attendants, volunteers and staff. It's hard wrangling 80 people to put on a huge free show, but knowing others will join us to reap the rewards makes it worth it one million times. Rest assured we're working tirelessly to have the time of our lives on December 7th! </p>

Also, our projection system allows people to watch the show from 3 different places in the venue, each with different sitting and standing options! Plus, we now STREAM our shows over twitch, and your support helps us improve the quality of it.
Training. Party Violence is its own unique sport. We have crafted a training program that makes use of experienced pro-wrestling coaching to help keep our PARTY ATHLETES smooth n' safe.  
Profit split. after we cover all our costs, we take 20% of our profits and reinvest it in PWR. We split up whatever is left among performers and staff who worked on the show.
For transparency: this Indiegogo doesn’t cover all of adolescent PWR’s expenses, but it takes care of a big chunk of them. Below is our complete operational budget.
Show Expenses: $2515.00:Art Supplies: $400.00Equipment Rental and Accessories (AC units, Video/Sound, Generators, etc): $600Construction Supplies: $50Insurance: $455.00Performer Assistance Fund: $200.00Ring/Facilities Maintenance: $175.00Office Supplies: $30.00Props/Costume: $75.00Security Phone: $60.00Transportation: $400.00Service Subscriptions: $70Operational Expenses: $4470:Artist and Staff Pay: $4070New Projects Capital: $400.00Indiegogo Reward production and fulfillment: $2960Indiegogo and credit card fees: $550

Risks and Challenges
 
As PWR continues its evolution from backyard party to professional art-collective, we never want to lose the heart of partying and stupidness that makes it good. We aim to balance a relentless work ethic with a light touch and and inviting environment for our attendants, volunteers and staff. It's hard wrangling 80 people to put on a huge free show, but knowing others will join us to reap the rewards makes it worth it one million times. Rest assured we're working tirelessly to have the time of our lives on December 7th!

<p><b>BARAM &amp; SNIECKUS</b> is a show that’s very close to our hearts. Together we satirize the male/female dynamic in all of its complicated splendor. BARAM &amp; SNIECKUS showcases the unique point of view and chemistry that comes from being a real life comedy couple.</p>
<p>We're going back to our roots.

<p><span>It takes more than standing on stage to put on a show. We need your help to help us offset the costs of the planning and putting on a quality live show. Box office sales aren’t enough to make BARAM &amp; SNIECKUS go.</span></p>

<p><b>There are personnel expenses</b> because our director can’t pay rent with high fives and home-baked cookies. We also have a stage manager and musician to pay.

<p><b>There are publicity expenses </b>like paying our designer (who is very, incredibly talented) and getting flyers printed. Even with discounts and help from our friends, these things still cost money.</p>

<p><b><i>Yer Perks</i></b></p>You show us some love, we give it right back! Our perks are all based on your support for the National Theatre of the World and this particular show.

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Funding this project means supporting local theatre art. You're enriching the theatre and improv community by allowing artists and creators to do what they do best! <br/></p>
<p>We pride ourselves on acting as mentors on- and off-stage. Everything we learn from our experience with BARAM &amp; SNIECKUS will become part of our teaching through the National Theatre of the World. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> Art is risky. But you know that taking some risks is the the only way we can advance art. </p>
<p><b>Together we've tackled many live shows with a great deal of success.</b> </p>
<p>In 2008,  we (still Matt and Naomi here)<b> </b>along with Mad TV alumnus Ronald Pederson and firecracker Kayla Lorette began to produce our very first show with the National Theatre of the World. That show was <i>Impromptu Splendor </i>at Comedy Bar in Toronto. From its earliest incarnation, <i>Impromptu Splendor </i>(The Improvised Play) has always delivered a fresh, artful and provoking spectacle brought to life in the fashion of a one act play.<br/></p>
<p>Shortly after<i>Impromptu Splendor</i>, we joined forces with Chris Gibbs (a real comedic genius) to produce<i>The Carnegie Hall Show. </i>With song, circus acts, special guests, and an improvised radio play, <i>The Carnegie Hall Show  was </i>executed with all the grandeur of The Kennedy Centre Honors.</p>
<p>In July of 2011, with help from world class improviser Christy Bruce, The National Theatre of The World assembled Torontoʼs most prolific comedic improvisers and created an ongoing improvised episodic packed with drama, romance, intrigue and betrayal and simply called it <i>The Soaps! </i>After a successful inaugural season at Comedy Bar, the troupe was invited to participate in the Toronto Fringe as a benefit show for the festival called <i>Shawford-On-The-Pond</i>which played to sold out houses at The Bathurst Street Theatre. In 2011, The National Theatre of The World was the recipient of The Canadian Comedy Award for Best Improv Troupe for the second time and Ronald Pederson received the Best Male Improviser Award.<br/></p>

There are publicity expenses like paying our designer (who is very, incredibly talented) and getting flyers printed. Even with discounts and help from our friends, these things still cost money.
At the end of the day, we hope that -- like us -- you value artistic expression, cultural richness, and experimenting with creativity. This is what the National Theatre of the World is all about. We are so very over-the-moon grateful for your support.
Yer PerksYou show us some love, we give it right back! Our perks are all based on your support for the National Theatre of the World and this particular show. We’ve got postcards, tickets, and meet-and-greets to express our deep gratitude for your support. Thank you! Check out the listed perks for specifics about what you get when you contribute to this campaign. Did we say ""Thank You"" yet? Thank you. Hey you. Thank you. Thanks so much. Gosh you look great. Thanks for your support.

The Impact Funding this project means supporting local theatre art. You're enriching the theatre and improv community by allowing artists and creators to do what they do best! 
We pride ourselves on acting as mentors on- and off-stage. Everything we learn from our experience with BARAM & SNIECKUS will become part of our teaching through the National Theatre of the World. 
    Risks & Challenges  Art is risky. But you know that taking some risks is the the only way we can advance art. 
Together we've tackled many live shows with a great deal of success. 
In 2008,  we (still Matt and Naomi here) along with Mad TV alumnus Ronald Pederson and firecracker Kayla Lorette began to produce our very first show with the National Theatre of the World. That show was Impromptu Splendor at Comedy Bar in Toronto. From its earliest incarnation, Impromptu Splendor (The Improvised Play) has always delivered a fresh, artful and provoking spectacle brought to life in the fashion of a one act play.
Shortly afterImpromptu Splendor, we joined forces with Chris Gibbs (a real comedic genius) to produceThe Carnegie Hall Show. With song, circus acts, special guests, and an improvised radio play, The Carnegie Hall Show  was executed with all the grandeur of The Kennedy Centre Honors.
In July of 2011, with help from world class improviser Christy Bruce, The National Theatre of The World assembled Torontoʼs most prolific comedic improvisers and created an ongoing improvised episodic packed with drama, romance, intrigue and betrayal and simply called it The Soaps! After a successful inaugural season at Comedy Bar, the troupe was invited to participate in the Toronto Fringe as a benefit show for the festival called Shawford-On-The-Pondwhich played to sold out houses at The Bathurst Street Theatre. In 2011, The National Theatre of The World was the recipient of The Canadian Comedy Award for Best Improv Troupe for the second time and Ronald Pederson received the Best Male Improviser Award.

You can use Indiegogo's handy share tools to tell people why they should kick over some cash to support Toronto's improv and live theatre scene. 
THANK YOU. Thank you times a million billion hundred zillion. We can't do this without you. 
Much love, 
Matt, Naomi, and the crew

<p>We are Cantankerous. We met 4 years ago and started being funny together.  After a 2 year break we decided it was high time we milked our Irish-ness, and came together in Bristol to develop characters and write a script.</p>
<p>After 9 months of devising, improvising and trying out material at every chance we could get, our play “Woolly eyed turtle” has slowly unfolded. Our dream of taking our duo to the Edinburgh Fringe has become a terrifying and exciting reality. It is a true showcase of our friendship and everything we have been working on to date.</p>
<p>We cannot express how much it means to us to have your support, to make this happen.  We want it so much, and we can't do it without you.  We plan to take the show on tour and continue making work together in the coming year.  This money will really set us up for a year of creativity and allow us to concentrate on the tasks at hand to achieve this goal. </p>

<h3>The Short Version</h3>
<p><strong><i>A quick message from writer/performer Helen Monks:</i></strong></p>
<p>This is a comedy. I promise. But I want to do a VERY brief serious (as serious as I can be) spiel about the show.</p>
<p>This is mostly to manipulate you into giving us money. But it also happens to be true.</p>
<p>It was becoming a daily thing for a friend to text or call or come round and say: ‘I want to die.’</p>
<p>Sometimes this would be ‘good dying’ – ‘I saw Taylor Swift last night and now I want to LITERALLY die.’</p>
<p>(FYI oldies, you can normal tell it’s not literal when we preface it with the word ‘literally’.)</p>
<p>But otherwise ‘I want to die’ was always delivered with this weird, underlying small quiver of truth. This deep, exhausted sigh… this ‘what if?’…</p>
<p>And then we’d laugh and talk about Taylor Swift and pretend everything was ok. But it would make the air just that little bit stickier. And I’m not very good at showering so the stick started to build up into a sort of depressing, icky paste.</p>
<p>It’s like when I went to uni. I ate A LOT of food at uni. But you don’t notice weight gain when it’s on you – it happens slowly. It takes going back to your home friends, who have only seen the before and after, and them saying, ‘Who ate Helen?’ for you to actually spot something’s up.</p>
<p>I remember looking round and realising that everyone was mentally OBESE. I realised I was sticky all over.</p>
<p>And not in the way I would normally like.</p>
<p>I remember thinking, this is not normal. Yes, people struggle with their mental health. Yes, people get down in the dumps. But for an entire generation to be totally crippled by loneliness, hopeless, poverty and fear.</p>
<p>This is not normal.</p>
<p>We shouldn’t have got used to this being our normal.</p>
<p>‘Dolly Wants To Die’ is about fighting against everything that society – grrr, society – is throwing at us. Overdrafts, debt, crammed house shares, unpaid internships, being overworked and undervalued, being lonely, being poor. It’s about holding up a mirror to all those friends who called in the middle night, and all those friends who didn’t but really, really wanted to, and saying – look, see! It’s not just you. It’s ok.</p>
<p>Well, it’s not ok.</p>
<p>But it’s not just you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(IT’S A COMEDY I PROMISE.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><i>A quick message from <i>LUNG</i>:</i></strong></p>
<p>Creating a new show requires a lot of time, love and money. We've been making theatre together and touring work nationally since 2012, so we've clocked in the hours, and tried and tested our mutual affection for one another. As Associate Artists at The Lowry we've been able to develop the show there, and at The Civic in Barnsley, and both venues have been extremely generous in providing us with valuable rehearsal space, advice and other in-kind resources. Now though we need your support to help us remain financially secure in getting Dolly up to the Fringe this year, and ensure we can keep making work long afterwards. </p>
<p>If this sounds like something you might like to help us with, or perhaps you're just eager to find out more, then read on for more info or check out what our dear Dolly has to say in the video above. Next, see the lovely shiny perks to the right? Well we've made them specially for you. Choose one you really like the look of and give us a helping hand. Your contribution - large or small - will be hugely appreciated and go a long way in helping us bring the show to it's full potential.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you don't feel able to help financially, that's OK. Give us a like instead. Follow us on Twitter, share this campaign, and come and see the show. We've got dates in Sheffield and London before we hit the Burgh. Helping us spread the word is half the battle, and we'd love to hear from you.</p>

<h3>The Show</h3>
<p>Dolly is a potty-mouthed, chain-smoking, whiskey-swigging china doll. She can sing, she can dance, she can throw a tea party like a bitch – she can do anything the kids she looks after could ever want. But Dolly can’t do the one thing that she really wants: Dolly can’t die.<br/><br/>With no skin to cut, no lungs to pop and no heart to stop, every attempt on her life fails drastically. Dolly is determined that with some assistance she could manage it: someone to run her over with the toy tractor, or help her in the bed-time-bath with the toaster.<br/>The first generation to grow up poorer than their parents, having to coach kids from childhood to adulthood is now a cynical job for Dolly. Much like the kids she looks after, love has turned to hat, ambition has turned to pessimism and any chance of happiness has become heavily dependant on Xanax.<br/><br/>Presenting first world problems in an imaginary world, this offbeat comedy is a modern Toy Story for the Prozac generation. Through story-telling, dance and standup, Dolly Wants to Die explores the peril of entering adulthood and what an absolute ball ache it is staying alive. <br/><br/>Written and performed by <strong>Helen Monks</strong>, Germaine in channel 4's 'Raised by Wolves'. </p>
<h3>What Will My Money Buy?</h3>
<p>Creating a new show costs a lot of money, and Edinburgh - wonderful, bonkers, inspiring Edinburgh - is expensive. We need your support to help us fund the final few weeks of rehearsal and development of Dolly Wants To Die, bring it to full production ready for previews at Theatre Delicatessen and Funny Women Festival followed by a month long run at Underbelly, Edinburgh.<br/><br/>A small amount can go a really long way in ensuring we can get to Edinburgh in one piece, sleep easy at night and ensure Dolly Wants To Die will be the best show it can be. Your money will go towards what we'd like to think of as the ""Bear Essentials"":</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Props and set.</strong> A bear costume and helping us create a real kids bedroom! </li>
<li>
<strong>Travel. </strong>This includes our own travel costs up to Edinburgh (doesn't matter where you're from in the country, that's a long way!) and van hire to transport our set for Dolly, which we will share with our other show - E15.</li>
<li>
<strong>Marketing. </strong>A portion of this money will contribute to flyers and posters to be used to promote the show in the Edinburgh.</li>
<li>
<strong>Workshops. </strong>This is something our writer and performer Helen Monks is really passionate about. And we are too (see about us for more info). We want to run workshops ahead of the Fringe, and afterwards, with school children aged 15+ to help encourage young women to get into comedy - a still male-dominated genre. Your donations will help facilitate these.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To make the above possible we're looking for the meagre(ish) sum of £1,750. </strong></p>
<p>In addition to Indiegogo we are seeking funding from other sources to complete the project, but with no guarantee the money raised from this campaign will play a huge part in getting the project to where we need it to be.  And it is, we think, a really manageable figure.</p>

Your money will go towards what we'd like to think of as the ""Bear Essentials"":


Props and set. A bear costume and helping us create a real kids bedroom! 

Travel. This includes our own travel costs up to Edinburgh (doesn't matter where you're from in the country, that's a long way!) and van hire to transport our set for Dolly, which we will share with our other show - E15.

Marketing. A portion of this money will contribute to flyers and posters to be used to promote the show in the Edinburgh.

Workshops. This is something our writer and performer Helen Monks is really passionate about. And we are too (see about us for more info). We want to run workshops ahead of the Fringe, and afterwards, with school children aged 15+ to help encourage young women to get into comedy - a still male-dominated genre. Your donations will help facilitate these.

To make the above possible we're looking for the meagre(ish) sum of £1,750. 
In addition to Indiegogo we are seeking funding from other sources to complete the project, but with no guarantee the money raised from this campaign will play a huge part in getting the project to where we need it to be.  And it is, we think, a really manageable figure.

 We are a diverse group of artists committed to bringing accessible,
professional, quality theatre to the city of Baltimore. </span></p>
<p>For the past 5 years,
Stillpointe's shows have been produced in a nomadic sense, moving from space to
space to fit the production at hand.  We pride ourselves on transforming
non-theatrical spaces into intricately designed, intimate theatre environments
that transform both classic and original works of theatre.  We have
produced work in art galleries, churches, coffee shops, old bathhouses, and
refurbished vinyl factories, and now we move into the next phase, because we
have wonderful news...</p>
<p><b>WE FOUND A SPACE!  </b></p><p><b></b>That's right!  A real space!
 Not a THEATRE space really, but a space nonetheless!  Located in the
burgeoning Station North Arts and Entertainment District, we finally have a
space to call our very own!  No more extensive load-ins and load-outs!
 No more stressing to find rehearsal space!  Finally we can stop
having meetings at each other's houses!  What a wonderful thing!</p>
<p>Here's where you come in.
 YES, <b>YOU</b>!</p>
<p>As we are sure you are well aware,
the cost of transforming this space into a full functioning theatre is not
cheap.  We're looking to our patrons, friends, families and the public at
large to help us raise the money for necessary improvements and additions to
our space.  Your support allows us to make needed renovations,
install lighting and sound equipment, and produce our first season in our new
space!  In addition, you'll be providing the city of Baltimore with
another multi-use arts space! </p><p>The theatre scene of Baltimore is vast and diverse, providing audiences with a wide array of quality entertainment and cultural enrichment. However, most companies do not have a space to call their own and many end up in the same boat as Stillpointe, having to relocate from show to show to suit scheduling demands and limited space options. The addition of The Stillpointe Theater will provide an additional space for companies to utilize outside of our regular season, allowing more theatre to be produced, and therefore, greater opportunities for community enrichment. <br/></p>
<p><b>OK, SO WHAT COULD YOU POSSIBLY
NEED TO TURN THIS INTO A THEATRE?</b></p>
<p>For this campaign we are looking
to raise $25,000. That number may seem steep, and honestly, it is! But turning
an old store front space into a black box theatre is going to require a bit
more than some black paint and a spotlight! Here's how we plan to upgrade the
existing space so better fit our needs! </p>
<p><b>RENOVATIONS/WINTERIZING:</b></p>
<p>
</p><p><b></b></p><p><b></b></p><b></b><p><b></b></p><b></b><p><b></b></p><b></b><p><b></b></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450136539/gzltr1pn45ajjkd52wfm.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 282.96610169491527px; height: 212px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450135997/rjhjuop06swrq8mhcbzk.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 303.9634703196347px; height: 212px;""/></p>Our space is unique because it is
an old store front space on Charles Street. A fortune teller used to operate
out of the building next door and Pearson's Florists, a Baltimore Institution
is to our right. The space may have worked for retail, but now we need
something different. The entire back section of the space is unfinished brick
and concrete, leading to an alley that is , well, not very accommodating. With
your support, we plan to winterize our new ""back stage area"" so that
it is comfortable year round.  The front section will become our shop, so
additional power will have to be run, and workshop space will have to be
constructed.  We also plan to turn the far back room into dressing rooms,
which will require further materials and labor. Making this backstage area into
a comfortable space for our artists to construct and prepare for a show is very
high on our list of priorities for the space. <div>   <p><b>LIGHTING AND SOUND:</b></p>
<p>Well I guess we DO have to let
you see and hear what we're doing right? While our space is not the Hippodrome,
we still pride ourselves on the the caliber of work we produce. A solid
lighting rig will allow the space to function more universally, giving us
options of how to light, design, and configure the space. Our lighting tools
will also be at the disposal of any outside performers, from an open mic with a
single spotlight, to a full production with strobes and hazers! Unfortunately,
these rigs are not something you can acquire over time, and can cost a pretty
penny. The great thing is, however, once it is installed, it is an invaluable
resource for our company, as well as other companies that may utilize the
space. </p>
<p>Sound equipment also plays into
this. Again, while our space is not the largest, good sound can be what makes
or breaks a show.  Our artists sometimes have to combat outside noise as
well as very loud instrumentalists, and with proper amplification, we can
ensure that our artists will be heard and the audience will get the full
Stillpointe experience. This is also beneficial to visiting artists utilizing
the space, as this equipment can usually be very expensive to rent. </p>

</p>
<p>This new space, like any other
apartment, home, or office comes with its own set of challenges and hurdles.
While we can be confident in our ability to create dynamic, moving pieces of
theatre to pay our rent, some expenses come out of the blue. Things like
insurance, permits, and unforeseen renovations can really throw a curveball to
small companies like ours. With your support, we can make sure these minor
hiccups will not deplete us financially, so that we can get back to doing what
we do best, making theatre for the city of Baltimore. </p>
<p><b>BUT WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME?!</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Well, we're glad you asked! </b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Along with your donation being </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">tax-deductible</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">, we have an array of
perks and prizes for various levels of donation. These offers include having
your name immortalized on our donor lobby display, to Stillpointe swag, to the
full VIP Stillpointe experience! No matter which level you choose to give, we
promise that it will not go unnoticed! Take a look at the list of perks and
prizes listed to the right to find the level you're most excited about! </span></p>
<p>But the real perk is not in
t-shirts and complimentary tickets.  The real prize in all of this is that
the city of Baltimore will have one more theatre space to enrich the community.
The community of Station North is growing fast, and with the addition of The
Stillpointe Theater, it can continue to do so. </p>
<p>We also must note that if all
funds are not met, not all is lost! We are appreciative of any support we can
get, and support for this campaign means something more. We aren't just trying
to raise funds to produce our season. We're not trying to get rights to a
particular show. We're creating a space for art to come to life. A place where
people gather to laugh, or cry, or maybe just try to put the outside world on
mute for a moment. This is so much bigger than anything we've done, and the
support we garner from this campaign will be plugged directly back into the
space, however little the amount. </p>
<p><b>MAKING AN IMPACT</b></p>
<p>We won't be long-winded with this
section, for fear of sounding like a broken record, but the impact of a space
like The Stillpointe Theater within our community would be notable. As you
likely remember, our city suffered a serious blow in April of this year.
Stillpointe had to move back our opening of ""AVENUE Q"" by one week to
accommodate curfews and safety, due to the events happening in Baltimore. When
the curtain finally rose on opening night, and the audience broke into their
first round of laughter, it felt as if something was lifted. People needed to
laugh. They needed to be reminded of the beauty and humor of the world. And if
a silly, dirty puppet show can do that, imagine what more and more works can
do. We don't just do our work for ourselves. We do it for the community. </p>
<p>By becoming a fixture of the
Station North Arts and Entertainment District, we can continue to enrich the
community and participate in the cultural renaissance our city is experiencing!</p>
<p><b>WHAT'S LIFE WITHOUT A LITTLE
RISK?</b></p>
<p>While we are confident in our
abilities to produce quality theatre, we also know that running a theatre space
comes with it's own set of headaches. The costs of keeping the lights on and
the heat pumping are going to add up. We know that as a company we have to step
up to increase audience development and outreach, as well as stepping up our
game production-wise to keep the seats filled and the space well funded. </p>
<p>But if the past 5 years have taught
us anything as a company, it's that we are stronger together than we are apart,
and that includes maintaining our relationship with our audiences. We've asked patrons to drive 40 minutes
outside the city, to a field on a cow farm, to watch our first show,
""TITUS ANDRONICUS"". And they did it! Those same people have attended show after show
because they believe in our vision. They believe in our spirit. And they
believe that no matter what we set our minds to, the finished product will
always be perfectly ""Stillpointe."" </p>
<p><b>HOW ELSE CAN YOU HELP, YOU SAY?! </b></p>
<p>We understand, as working
artists, that money is tight. But not all support for Stillpointe has to be
monetary! </p>
<p><b>Sharing our campaign </b>and helping us get the word out is a wonderful way to show
support! Use the buttons of this page to share our campaign across several social
media platforms. The more people that can see our story and know our goal, the
better chance we have of raising $25,000. Tell your friends! Tell your
co-workers! Tell your grandma over Christmas dinner! You know she loves
theatre! </p>
<p>Better still, if you'd like to
help us even further, volunteering for Stillpointe is also a great way to
support! Are you good with tools? Happen to be a gifted grant writer?  Do
you bake (food)? Have a unique skill we don't know we need yet? Drop us a
line and let's chat! There are so many ways to help Stillpointe. We pride
ourselves on being a collaborative, community of artists, and we are always
happy to welcome others into the fold!</p>
<p>We here at Stillpointe thank you
so much for taking the time to get to know us and our campaign. If we may speak frankly, having our own space is a dream we have been chasing for quite a while. And now it's finally within our grasp! Our goal as a company has always been to produce quality work for our audiences and to let that work propel us into becoming a permanent fixture in the Baltimore theatre community. We firmly believe that with the installation of this new space in Station North, we can do all that AND MORE! We hope you
will support us however you can, and we hope to see you at our next
production! </p>

circus and traveling. What first looked like a one-time-thing is growing
 to be an international network for people sharing a passion for 
performance arts. Contemporary circus is a way of exchanging with people
 from different backgrounds and getting to know their cultures. With 
this year's tour, we want to intensify this exchange, get to know more 
artists and projects and learn from them.<br/>
Therefore we need your help!<br/><br/><p></p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
</div><p>
</p><div>
<h2>What is Zirkrobajka all about?<br/>
</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Since 2012, Zirkrobajka has gone on tour every summer with a different 
crew. We travelled through Poland, Romania, Ukraine, Turkey and Germany.
 At the different stations, we have workshops for kids and teenagers in 
social projects and performed on the streets or at festivals. Apart from
 our interest in other cultures and living situation we are of the 
opinion that contemporary circus and theatre can cross linguistic as 
well as cultural borders.<br/>
The members of Zirkrobajka themselves come from different countries and 
backgrounds. Some of them work with circus or theatre on a professional 
level, for others it has been a passion for years, others are just 
(re)discovering performing arts.<br/>
Zirkrobajka shows us that it's possible to realize something growing and
 lasting without professional help or big financial means. Without 
working together closely within the project, but also with the partner 
projects, a continuity would not be possible.<br/>
Zirkrobajka is not supposed to exist only during the summer, but to 
provide a platform for mutual inspiration thorughout the whole year. The
 yearly summer tour is laying the groundwork for this development.<br/>
</p>
</div>
<p>
</p><div>
<h2>What are the goals and who is the project for?<br/>
</h2>
<p></p>
<p>After the last tours, this year we want to focus on the exchange with 
other young people active in performing arts. We are going to visit 
several projects in Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia - both social 
projects and circus or theare groups, who are active in the social realm
 themselves. We want to get to know and learn from each other to mount 
something together - be it workshops for kids or fellow artists lead 
together or a free show for the people of the village or neighbourhood. 
This form of exchange is supposed to be more sustainable than the simple
 visit of a social project - all parties can learn from it.<br/>
Zirkrobajka mainly approaches kids, teenagers and young people, with or 
without experience in the performing arts, from various backgrounds and 
countries.</p>
</div>
<p>
</p><div>
<h2>Why should you support Zirkrobajka?<br/>
</h2>

<p>Zirkrobajka was mounted by friends, who share the same passions: circus 
and performing arts, traveling and curiosity for other cultures. Since 
its foundation, many people have joined us and it's great to see how we 
can work together thorughout the year to realize a common project.<br/>
The project was never aimed at financial gain, all the people active in Zirkrobajka invest their time and ideas voluntarily.<br/>
Outside the field of professional peforming arts, there are not too many
 possibilities for networking and cooperation between semi-professional 
projects, which also have a social dimension. Zirkrobajka fills exactly 
this gap, which is also proven by the positive feedback of the already 
or to-be-visited projects.<br/>
Unfortunately, Zirkrobajka's concept of traveling through different 
countries and to various projects alongside with the status between a 
youth project and a professional one doesn't fit most funding programs. 
However, we still hope to be able to continue traveling and making 
Zirkrobajka live on!</p>

<p>During the last years, our circus bus was carrying us over many bumpy 
roads. After three tours, it had to retire. That's why we urgently need a
 new means of transport. Some of our destinations are difficult to reach
 with public transport. Also, a circus journey requires (apart from 
several artists) a lot of equipment such as costumes, juggling material,
 tools, tents, etc. Therefore, we want to collect money for a new 
(second hand) bus, which will carry us this summer and hopefully also in
 the future!<br/>
If we even get more money than to buy the bus, we are also happy - after all, a bus also needs insurance and gas.</p>

area of circus- or theatre paedagogy, others do performance arts as a

</div><br/></div>","Zirkrobajka was founded in 2011 by some friends who wanted to combine 
circus and traveling. What first looked like a one-time-thing is growing
 to be an international network for people sharing a passion for 
performance arts. Contemporary circus is a way of exchanging with people
 from different backgrounds and getting to know their cultures. With 
this year's tour, we want to intensify this exchange, get to know more 
artists and projects and learn from them.
Therefore we need your help!   


What is Zirkrobajka all about?


Since 2012, Zirkrobajka has gone on tour every summer with a different 
crew. We travelled through Poland, Romania, Ukraine, Turkey and Germany.
 At the different stations, we have workshops for kids and teenagers in 
social projects and performed on the streets or at festivals. Apart from
 our interest in other cultures and living situation we are of the 
opinion that contemporary circus and theatre can cross linguistic as 
well as cultural borders.
The members of Zirkrobajka themselves come from different countries and 
backgrounds. Some of them work with circus or theatre on a professional 
level, for others it has been a passion for years, others are just 
(re)discovering performing arts.
Zirkrobajka shows us that it's possible to realize something growing and
 lasting without professional help or big financial means. Without 
working together closely within the project, but also with the partner 
projects, a continuity would not be possible.
Zirkrobajka is not supposed to exist only during the summer, but to 
provide a platform for mutual inspiration thorughout the whole year. The
 yearly summer tour is laying the groundwork for this development.




What are the goals and who is the project for?


After the last tours, this year we want to focus on the exchange with 
other young people active in performing arts. We are going to visit 
several projects in Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia - both social 
projects and circus or theare groups, who are active in the social realm
 themselves. We want to get to know and learn from each other to mount 
something together - be it workshops for kids or fellow artists lead 
together or a free show for the people of the village or neighbourhood. 
This form of exchange is supposed to be more sustainable than the simple
 visit of a social project - all parties can learn from it.
Zirkrobajka mainly approaches kids, teenagers and young people, with or 
without experience in the performing arts, from various backgrounds and 
countries.



Why should you support Zirkrobajka?

""Where does our magic come from?"" ""Where are the myths we find within our own myths?"" At the core, AN AMERICAN MYTHOLOGY is an exploration of the complex stories we tell and the stories that aren't being told in the modern United States.</p>

<p><strong>THE YELLOW WALLPAPER</strong></p>
<p>Book, Music, and Lyrics by Erin McConnell and Evan Lange<br/>Directed by Janine Gardner and Trinity Gardner<br/>Featuring MTM Executive Director Meghan Randolph<br/>Streaming LIVE August 13-15th, 2021</p>
<p>In the late 1800s, a woman suffering from a ""nervous condition"" is brought to a country house to recover. Her husband refuses a first-floor room and instead selects the top floor of the home, a large space covered end to end in a bizarrely-patterned yellow wallpaper, by which the woman is instantly disgusted. As the weeks pass, her condition deteriorates, and she discovers a terrifying secret hidden beneath the paper's seams.</p>
<p>Based on Charlotte Perkins Gilman's iconic story, THE YELLOW WALLPAPER is an MTM original, brought to life by local composers Erin McConnell and Evan Lange, directed by Janine Gardner and Trinity Gardner, and performed by Executive Director Meghan Randolph. Embracing the story's deep impact on feminism, literature, and the horror genre, this tightly-woven psychological thriller is sure to give you chills, even on a hot summer night.</p>
<p>This production will include discussions with experts Emily Auerbach, Dr. Brigitte Fielder, and Karla Strand, who will explore the literary significance of The Yellow Wallpaper as well as the important history of Charlotte Perkins Gilman and what she did (and did not do) for feminism. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Goals and Perks</h3>
<p>Our goals will allow us to present the best possible season we can, reach a broad and diverse audience, and keep artists creating and exploring all of the facets of what musical theatre can be. We have three levels of funding we're hoping to achieve.</p>
<p><strong>Initial Goal: $3,500</strong></p>
<p>This will allow us to provide funds for additional resources to present our season to as many audience members as possible. This will include the ability to provide these events to more people free of charge. A portion of these funds will also go directly to the Artist Fund to continue our work of increasing artist pay long-term.</p>
<p><strong>Stretch Goal #1: $6,500</strong></p>
<p>This will allow us to commission a professional artist to develop a visual art work inspired by the the AN AMERICAN MYTHOLOGY concept album. (Additional Perks will be added once we meet our Initial Goal.)</p>
<p><strong>Stretch Goal #2: $12,500</strong></p>
<p>This will allow us to guaranteed future live performance of An AMERICAN MYTHOLOGY when it is safe to gather again and a professionally recorded Original Cast Recording of THE YELLOW WALLPAPER. (Additional Perks will be added once we meet our Initial Goal.)</p>
<p><strong>Perks:</strong></p>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Due to the theatrical shutdown of COVID-19, we've been forced to create alternative programming for our community. This has allowed us to conceptualize events like AN AMERICAN MYTHOLOGY and THE LAND OF THE GIFTED, and we're very grateful for the innovation it has brought out. But uncertainties are part of innovation, and while we embrace them, we rely on a lot of people to help us get to the finish line. We have been working hard to make sure everything is done to the utmost of our artistic ability and following the safety guidelines that will protect our community and artists.</p>
<p>While MTM is confident that we will be able to produce all of our 2021 offerings, your support will help us continue to innovate and grow for this season and many more, while also allowing us increased flexibility to conquer the challenges of creating new art. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know that not everyone can donate financially, however, that doesn't mean that you aren't a valued member of your support community. <strong>If you can spread the word about this fundraiser to five (5) individuals or organizations we will send you a special thank you from the staff at MTM in appreciation for you valuable contributions to our success! </strong></p>

The Impact
For all shows: With your support alongside our amazing staff and artists, we'll be able to hire over 80 people for work in the Madison area.  
For An American Mythology: Your investment in us helps our organization create a concept album that offers perspectives from BIPOC writers whose heritages span the globe. 
For The Yellow Wallpaper: With your donation, our company will create a brand new piece based on the classic short story while also enlisting local experts to explore the piece's impact and Charlotte Perkins Gilman's troubled history. 
For The Land of the Gifted: Your support in conjunction with our efforts will also help us bring a brand new learning experience infused with music, visual art, and storytelling, with an emphasis on reaching kids and families who are traditionally underserved by the arts. 

Risks & Challenges
Due to the theatrical shutdown of COVID-19, we've been forced to create alternative programming for our community. This has allowed us to conceptualize events like AN AMERICAN MYTHOLOGY and THE LAND OF THE GIFTED, and we're very grateful for the innovation it has brought out. But uncertainties are part of innovation, and while we embrace them, we rely on a lot of people to help us get to the finish line. We have been working hard to make sure everything is done to the utmost of our artistic ability and following the safety guidelines that will protect our community and artists.
While MTM is confident that we will be able to produce all of our 2021 offerings, your support will help us continue to innovate and grow for this season and many more, while also allowing us increased flexibility to conquer the challenges of creating new art. 

Other Ways You Can Help
We know that not everyone can donate financially, however, that doesn't mean that you aren't a valued member of your support community. If you can spread the word about this fundraiser to five (5) individuals or organizations we will send you a special thank you from the staff at MTM in appreciation for you valuable contributions to our success!",0.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As a recently graduated undergraduate director, I have found kickstarting my theatrical difficult in the current times. Rather than wait for the industry to liven up, I've decided to take my career into my own hands and work with the medium available to me in this time: the internet! While in person theatre may not be viable for the forseeable future; experiencing a live production, thanks to technology, is. </p>
<p><i>Why not take this opportunity to showcase my own, and many other female collaborators' talents?</i></p>
<p>This play is one that I have been in love with for 4 years now. It's an extremely dark satire on the ""female teen comedy"" trope. Think Mean Girls, Heathers, etc. </p>
<p>The playwright perfectly sums it up in this quote: </p>
<p><i>This is a play that deconstructs destructive female stereotypes through <strong>appropriation </strong>and <strong>release.</strong> Borrowing from contemporary tropes such as <strong>“teen comedy” </strong>as well as “<strong>classical fairy tale” </strong>narratives, the play highlights the untenable standards girls are subjected to daily while encouraging <strong>uncensored, brutal insights about womanhood.</strong></i></p>
<h3>Why funding is important:</h3>
<p>As an independent project produced solely by myself, Grace, all financial risks are shouldered by me. While I am fortunate to have savings that will account for some costs, I cannot shoulder the costs of fully mounting a production on my own. For a specific account of projected expenses, please look below.</p>
<p>My biggest priority in this project is ensuring that all of my collaborators are compensated for their time and work. <strong>The entire team, including the cast, will be made up of young, 20-23 year old womxn</strong>. I believe our time, our efforts, and our voices are valuable, so I  want to show my fellow early-career collaborators that they are worth being paid for their art! </p>
<h3>Why this play is important: </h3>
<p>As a young woman, and especially as a young woman of (confused) color, I identify with nearly all of the ideations, struggles, and upsetting moments this play associates with growing up as a girl in America.  I’ve always struggled with the genre of “teen comedy,” the tropes of “mean girls,” and especially the trope of the “nice girl/protagonist"" (who is almost always white, and still confusingly perfect). Admittedly, however, these stories have shaped my judgements of myself and others. <strong>Even more dangerously, these narratives have shaped who I have become, what I believe is and isn't possible for me, and where I believe I ""fit"" in the narrative. </strong></p>
<p><strong>What draws me to this play is the way it unabashedly hyperbolizes the tropes of these stories.</strong> It brutally demonstrates the violent, stereotypical, yet pervasive connotations that come with being a young woman.</p>
<p><strong>What I hope this play will do</strong> is make the more<strong> subtle violences</strong> embedded in the stories we tell young women <strong>visible</strong>, in order to <strong>empower everyone to change our narratives.</strong></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>Here is a breakdown of expenses for this production:</strong></p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The show is a risk. It is deliberately not ""Politically Correct"" and therefore is not a play that will sit well with audiences from many different sides of the spectrum. I believe in the narrative purpose of the potentially uncomfortable or disturbing moments in the play, and aim to handle them in the most respectful, safe, and non-gratuitous way possible. Audiences will be warned of any potentially triggering or upsetting subject matter well in advance, as well as immediately prior to every performance. </p>

<h3>STRETCH GOAL!!!!</h3>
<p>We are so thrilled to have hit our initial goal of $2000 in under two weeks!  We have set a stretch goal of $3000 and would be so grateful if you would contribute any amount to help us reach this new goal.  <strong>Why do we still need money?</strong> Because our initial goal of $2000 covered the bare bones costs of making this show happen.  With this figure, provided we sell a decent amount of tickets, we will be able to pay our theater rental figure ($700), our lighting designer ($250), our producer ($500), our floor rental ($250), and marketing expenses ($300) - but leaves no money to pay to our professional performing artists.  It is a sad reality that in the arts, especially in dance, the DANCERS who actually make the show what it is are often the last people paid.  Please help us show our performers that we value them by helping us raise that extra $1000 that will be paid to them!  <strong>Read below for our full story if you aren't familiar with this project yet!</strong></p>
<h3>WHO ARE WE?</h3>
<p>Touché Taps was founded in July 2014, and since its inception, the company has maintained commitment and attention to providing quality tap and percussive dance education to teens and adults.  By pairing professionals and students, the company strives to continue tap and percussive dance’s long history of cultivating and nurturing community. By bringing together guest artists, professionals, and students from across Massachusetts, New Hampshire and the greater Northeast, Touché Taps offers affordable, high quality instruction to those interested in diving deeper into a dance form that is not often at the forefront of studio dance education.</p>
<p><strong>About the Artistic Director:</strong></p>
<p>Shaina Schwartz has been performing and teaching throughout New England for over 10 years.  An attendee of the Boston Youth Moves program at Jeannette Neill Dance Studio, she went on to study music and theater at the Hartt School of Music in Hartford, CT. A former resident artist at the award-winning children's theater, The Peacock Players, and dance captain/co-choreographer with the Boston Tap Company, Shaina is now the primary tap instructor at Boston University and several Greater Boston area studios.  As Artistic Director Touché Taps, Shaina has provided comprehensive music, dance and composition training to over 300 dancers, ages 7-65+!</p>

<h3>THE SHOW:</h3>
<p>Touché Taps was founded in July 2014, and since its inception, the company has maintained commitment and attention to providing quality tap and percussive dance education to teens and adults.  Touché Taps believes that performance is an incredibly important aspect of education: in order to fulfill their mission of well-rounded education, the company seeks to showcase the students’ and professionals’ hard work and dedication throughout the 2017-2018 season.  <i>4 on the Floor </i>will feature works performed by students, professionals, and a mix of both, all influenced and enhanced by a year of intensive study with some of the finest tap educators in New England and beyond.  This show will take place in the Studio 7 event space at The Dance Complex on Sunday October 21 at 6 and 8pm: for more information, or to buy tickets, be sure to visit 4onthefloor.eventbrite.com!</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>At this point, it has been well documented that access to arts education is incredibly impactful for youth.  On average, adolescents exposed to arts education are less likely to use drugs and alcohol, and are more likely to be engaged in academic pursuits and <a href=""https://www.arts.gov/sites/default/files/Research-Art-Works-Maryland.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">optimistic about their academic futures.</a>  <a href=""https://www.arts.gov/publications/decade-arts-engagement-findings-survey-public-participation-arts-2002-2012"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Research</a> also shows that exposure to the arts at a young age is a strong predictor of continued participation in the arts in adulthood.  The arts continue to benefit individuals as they age.  Young adults who continue to participate in the arts tend to be more optimistic about their futures and <a href=""https://www.arts.gov/sites/default/files/Research-Art-Works-Maryland.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">engaged in academic pursuits</a>.  Beyond emotional health and academic engagement, dance in particular is becoming increasingly recognized as <a href=""https://www.michaeljfox.org/foundation/news-detail.php?for-parkinsons-dance-symptoms-self-expression"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">a method to help treat Parkinson's disease</a>, and of course, has always been known as a way to stay physically fit and mentally strong.  Dancers have strong balance and coordination skills, become <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/the-athletes-way/201310/why-is-dancing-so-good-your-brain"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">dizzy less often than non-dancers</a>, and <a href=""http://neuro.hms.harvard.edu/harvard-mahoney-neuroscience-institute/brain-newsletter/and-brain-series/dancing-and-brain"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">maintain higher levels of serotonin</a> (our ""feel good"" hormone).</p>
<p>Touché Taps is a company that is committed to providing low-cost, high-quality dance instruction to recreational and professional dancers of all ages.  In supporting Touché Taps, you are supporting not only this production and those performing in it, but the health and well-being of the hundreds of students who receive arts engagement via the company.  Furthermore, if we are successful in our fundraising efforts for this show, we will be able to offer tickets at an extremely affordable rate (as little as $8!), which will remove one of many barriers to entry for those who wish to enjoy the benefits of witnessing live performance... <a href=""https://www.educationnext.org/learning-live-theater/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this can be just as valuable for people as doing the actual dancing</a>!</p>
<p><strong>The Budget</strong></p>
<p>We are anticipating production costs for this show to be between $1800 and $2200.  This includes very modest quotes for theater rental, lighting design, printing costs, and marketing fees... it all adds up quickly!  We also hope to pay modest honorariums to each of our professional performing artists, all while keeping costs low for attendees.  Even if we sell out each of our performances, we would likely be at a deficit of $2000 or more.  There are very few dance performances in Boston, the United States, and even the world that are able to cover all costs via ticket sales.  Fundraising is a necessity for almost all art forms in this country, but especially for dance.  We absolutely need a minimum of $2000 in order to make this show a reality.  Any money raised over $2000 will allow us to increase honorariums paid to dancers, thereby more accurately reflecting their incredible commitments of time, energy, and talent.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</h3>
<p>We are putting this together VERY quickly and with VERY little back up funding.  Every dollar helps, but if we are unable to raise enough of them, we will not be able to host this show.  Additionally, many of our current dancers are based in New Hampshire.  Doing a show in Boston will take us a little further away from our usual audience.  We are hoping that making this move will help us connect with new friends and fans, but we might need some help in drawing attention to this double header event.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>OTHER WAYS TO HELP:</h3>
<p>If you want to help, but are lacking the financial means to do so, contributions of any kind, big or small, tangible or intangible, are greatly appreciated:<br/><br/>-Spread the word! Share this project with folks who might be interested, and help us gain some momentum.</p>

<h2><strong>OUR STORY</strong></h2>
<p>We are Natalia Bushnik and Robin Luckwaldt. Together, we form <strong>KAIROS theatre.</strong></p>
<p>There is a complex, grey morality in each of us. We strive to connect to this place through our work. Above all, our mission is to give power to the underestimated through performance. We are, predominantly, a physical theatre company; the stories and the structures of our plays are dependent upon the movement score supporting our original text. We have collaborated on, and produced four original works. Our first, <strong><i>The Bathtub Girls</i></strong>, is a fiction inspired by the first documented case of sibling matricide in Canada. <i>The Bathtub Girls</i> began as a contact improvisation project at the University of Windsor in 2016, and has since travelled in Canada and the US. We feel that it's high time we share it with the vital community here in Toronto. </p>
<p><strong><i>The Bathtub Girls</i> is a fiction inspired by the first documented case of sibling matricide in Canada</strong>. The play follows two sisters who, encouraged by their friends, drown their mother in the bathtub of their family home. The play examines how three immigrants’ determination to assimilate into a Canadian suburb in Mississauga leads to the destruction of their family, and the rebuilding of the girls' lives. Their mother falls into a deep depression and alcoholism, until — from their perspective — the only solution is to end her life.</p>
<p>This is a story of marginalized young women. It is culturally necessary that we uplift the stories and needs of young people; it is our responsibility to help them cultivate tools for their future. <i>The Bathtub Girls</i> is an effort to wake people to this necessity. The events of the story take place in part due to neglect and complacency from the girls’ community. Our play exemplifies the consequences of ignoring young people in their times of need.</p>
<p>In its various iterations over the past three years of development, <i>The Bathtub Girls</i> has been produced at: Hamilton Fringe (Critics’ Choice, 2016); Tapestry Opera Space, as part of Then They Fight's <i>Then Speak</i> series 2017; Winnipeg Fringe 2017; and the curated season of the Twin Cities Horror Festival 2018, Minneapolis, USA.</p>

</div></div>","OUR STORY
We are Natalia Bushnik and Robin Luckwaldt. Together, we form KAIROS theatre.
There is a complex, grey morality in each of us. We strive to connect to this place through our work. Above all, our mission is to give power to the underestimated through performance. We are, predominantly, a physical theatre company; the stories and the structures of our plays are dependent upon the movement score supporting our original text. We have collaborated on, and produced four original works. Our first, The Bathtub Girls, is a fiction inspired by the first documented case of sibling matricide in Canada. The Bathtub Girls began as a contact improvisation project at the University of Windsor in 2016, and has since travelled in Canada and the US. We feel that it's high time we share it with the vital community here in Toronto. 
The Bathtub Girls is a fiction inspired by the first documented case of sibling matricide in Canada. The play follows two sisters who, encouraged by their friends, drown their mother in the bathtub of their family home. The play examines how three immigrants’ determination to assimilate into a Canadian suburb in Mississauga leads to the destruction of their family, and the rebuilding of the girls' lives. Their mother falls into a deep depression and alcoholism, until — from their perspective — the only solution is to end her life.
This is a story of marginalized young women. It is culturally necessary that we uplift the stories and needs of young people; it is our responsibility to help them cultivate tools for their future. The Bathtub Girls is an effort to wake people to this necessity. The events of the story take place in part due to neglect and complacency from the girls’ community. Our play exemplifies the consequences of ignoring young people in their times of need.
In its various iterations over the past three years of development, The Bathtub Girls has been produced at: Hamilton Fringe (Critics’ Choice, 2016); Tapestry Opera Space, as part of Then They Fight's Then Speak series 2017; Winnipeg Fringe 2017; and the curated season of the Twin Cities Horror Festival 2018, Minneapolis, USA.
Praise for The Bathtub Girls :
“A dark but compelling piece of theatre” - CBC
“Truly remarkable” - Minnesota Playlist
“Gripping storytelling” - City Pages, Minneapolis
“Extraordinary” - Winnipeg Free Press
“Truly phenomenal” - Fringe Review

What We Need
We have been given the incredible opportunity to perform a two-week run of our show, The Bathtub Girls; however, we will not be able to stage this production without the generosity donors like yourself. We are launching this campaign as an effort to cover costs for the rental space, purchase stage/costume materials, and provide subsistence for our Stage Manager, Sound Designer, Lighting Designer, and ourselves.

The Impact
A great strength of the show is the use of music and voiceover montages to score movement. We intend to take this integral aspect to a new level, by hiring and collaborating with the inimitable Phoebe Wang as Sound and Set Designer. Phoebe Wang is a queer installation and sound artist working between the US and Canada. She was recently named a 2018 NLGJA Excellence in Journalism Award winner, and Best New Artist at the 2018 Third Coast International Audio Festival for her work, God + The Gays. She was a member of The Heart, an audio art project and podcast, and the senior producer of The Shadows podcast (CBC). She designed five cues in our most recent iteration of The Bathtub Girls, and her work greatly enriched the arc of the play.

<p>From the team who brought you ‘The Diary of a Hounslow Girl’. Writer Ambreen Razia returns with her second play, POT, exploring the landscape of Britain’s invisible children, adrift in the care system and inadvertently impacted by gang culture.  Ambreen developed a passion for telling stories which were on her my doorstep but rarely ever seen in the mainstream. Excited by some of the stories she's heard by the young people she'd taught, it's now a mission of hers to carry their voices on to our stages and make sure that the theatre industry is accessible enough to provide seats to the voices and communities in which it portrays. </p>
<h2>POT</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509119034/m8cdbnd1xllf8wlj7fij.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Louisa wakes up in a flat on her estate surrounded by debris from last night’s blow out. Her boyfriend, Josh’s effort to conceal last night’s events is faltering. With the front door sealed and no signal on her phone, she realises she is not alone. Is Miles her means to get back to the world and reclaim her existence?    </p>
<p>Pot was inspired by Ambreen's work surrounding Gang culture as a facilitator, and also the likes of Tracey Millers autobiography 'Sour' and the Britain's forgotten  children season on channel 4.</p>
<p>The play explores questions which need answers: </p>
<p>Why are young people who come from care falling into Gang culture?</p>
<p>Why is their sense of belonging not being met?</p>
<p>Does society provide enough rehabilitation programmes and opportunities for our young people?</p>
<p>POT explores these questions through the characters which gives audiences a greater personal and intimate insight as to why ‘Gang culture’ is on the rise and why young people who come from care often turn to crime.</p>
<h2>Outreach</h2>

<p>As well as creating a full production and touring POT, We will engage audiences with Q&amp;A discussions after performances. Having worked as a facilitator for a number of years Ambreen will run workshops around some of the themes within the play. It's Ambreen's aim to set up open and facilitated discussions between audiences, those who have come from care the system, ex-gang members, care workers and local councils. The key questions being - How can we work together to help dissolve gang culture? How can we work together to make sure young people who leave care are able to re-assimilate into society in a healthy way? </p>

<strong>THE PLAY</strong><p>In April 1915, chemist Fritz Haber is already recognized as the giant of Western science who literally pulled food out of thin air with the Haber-Bosch process, averting the famine that threatened the world in 1912.  This will win him the Nobel Prize, but right now the world is at war and Fritz has just come home from the front.  His wife Clara Immerwahr, the first German woman to become a Doctor of Chemistry, is appalled to learn that he has directed the release of chlorine gas near the Belgian town of Ypres. </p>
<p>Fritz Haber has brought chemical warfare to the Western Front and into the 20th century. </p>
<p>The explosive argument that follows has implications for more than just the Haber family.  This is a true story that combines science with family drama into a ferocious spectacle that to this day shakes the world.</p>

<ul><li>Tour of the production to at least two other venues in Wisconsin, and one in Minnesota, who have indicated interest. </li></ul>
<p><strong>Why This Play Is Important,</strong> <strong>or</strong> <strong>What's At Stake?</strong></p>
<p>Can we make science a religion?  Can a scientist free himself from all moral considerations? Is scientific progress always progress for humanity?  Clara Immerwahr confronts her famous husband with these questions and more, never letting him distract her with his insistence that he is first of all a German patriot.  Demanding to know why Fritz would let himself become a tool for a class system that sneers at converted Jews such as themselves, their argument roars into the night louder than any barrage on the Western Front.</p>
<p>We are now living in the centenary of The Great War, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the only play about World War One being produced in the United States.  In a world where some estimates claim that half of all scientists are working on military projects, WHO ARE YOU, FRITZ HABER? addresses a monumental issue:   When you've applied scientific genius to weapons of mass destruction, have you really served your country? </p>
<p>The Haber family, one of the most accomplished in German history, was destroyed trying to answer this.  A warning for the future?  We shall see. </p>

<p>Since 2011, KACM Theatrical Productions has developed new plays such as SQUARE; searched out unusual plays such as THE LIZARD KING, a rarely produced dark comedy about rock star Jim Morrison's last days in Paris; and adapted the award-winning science fiction story THE DARFSTELLER as a play.  What we bring to the stage is always worth seeing.  Our web page is linked for further information.</p>

The première of ""Staatstheater"" at the Hamburg State Opera disassembled the traditional operatic institution and indeed the whole genre into its constituent parts, creating a much sought-after path for new music theatre which is as relevant today as it was almost half a century ago.</p><div>

Over the course of two days with three cameras they made a cinematic documentation of our production of ""Gunfighter Nation"" that was incredible! That was funded by the German Council of Music. Sadly, it was a one time opportunity...We want to continue working with Counter Production and making high quality operatic movies to reach a wider audience, so WE NEED YOUR HELP! About ""STAATSTHEATER""Pierre Boulez memorably declared in 1971 that the future of opera lay in the destruction of all opera houses, but in the very same year, Mauricio Kagel presented a revolutionary vision of the clean-up operation that could follow. The première of ""Staatstheater"" at the Hamburg State Opera disassembled the traditional operatic institution and indeed the whole genre into its constituent parts, creating a much sought-after path for new music theatre which is as relevant today as it was almost half a century ago.
In creating the score, Kagel gathered hundreds of theatrical, instrumental, vocal and physical miniatures; certain rules govern their usage, but they are fundamentally intended to be combined freely into a unique production. A new interpretation of the work therefore presents a compositional jigsaw whose pieces have neither clear edges nor, when combined, can present an overall picture.

<h3>Hello</h3>
<p>and thank you for having a peek at our campaign! We're Off Kilter, a Glasgow based emerging theatre company. We're a female-led creative team, which we think is fairly cool. The Edge of You is our debut show, about the gaps between what we say and what we think. For more information please head to our listing on the Official Edinburgh Fringe Festival website (eek!) which you can access <a href=""https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on#q=%22The%20Edge%20of%20You%22"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Edge of You was originally created for the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland's On The Verge Festival in June 2017. It was pretty well received. So well in fact, that we won the Bruce Millar award to help us take the show to the fringe. Now we've revamped, rewritten, gotten in a wonderful team of people, and we're ready to go.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the fringe is pretty expensive. Even with many wonderful people and organisations volunteering time and resources, we still come up short. The £5000 we received from Bruce Millar pretty much covers our venue, set, marketing, travel, and rehearsal costs. We still need to at least £1000 to ensure that the actors can still pay their rent while taking a chance on this wonderful new play. Reaching our stretch goal of £2000 would ensure that nobody ends up out of pocket. Even if we don't reach our goal, any amount of money would be a massive help. </p>
<p>If you honestly can't chuck any money our way, that's cool. We understand. But there are things you can do to help. If you could share our campaign on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, at your village knitting group, that would be amazing. And if you're coming to the Fringe this year, please come see our show and say hi!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading all this. </p>

The Play  ** The Money ** The Team Plans B, C, D... **    Your Help **    Special Thanks 




MOS is a vibrant piece of theatre that focuses awareness on American Sign Language and its critical importance in Deaf education.   Our multi-talented production team, half of which is made up of Deaf actors, designers, administrators and crew is working to bring this play Off Broadway and ultimately to Broadway. 
It's time to bring the world's attention to this little known  but fascinating and significant part of American History and the dynamic beginnings of Deaf culture.  
Help Movements of the Soul make its journey to the BIG LEAGUES by supporting this Indiegogo Campaign.
We are honored to welcome the preeminent neurosurgeon and author of Seeing Voices, Dr. Oliver Sacks to our advisory board.

Back in the 1800s, two iconoclastic men brought Deaf education to America using a revolutionary technique of teaching in the Deaf’s native language:  sign language.  
Most of mainstream America doesn’t know about Laurent Clerc and Thomas Gallaudet.   They broke
down barriers and changed the world in the face of insurmountable odds.    
 a play in two acts, is about the day they confronted the most difficult obstacles of all:  themselves.   
This theatrical production is a
passionate introduction to their incredible story told in a dazzling display of
American
Sign Language,
English and French by a top-shelf cast
of Deaf
and
hearing actors.

With
the help of this dedicated Broadway-credited cast and with the
multi-talented director, Joe Cacaci at
the helm, playwright
Carol
Schneider, has carved out and refined this play for the past six years.  
Our
long term goal is to
get this production to Broadway.  
This Indiegogo Campaign
is
part of a series of concerted efforts we’re making to achieve
this goal.
Join the Movement and  be a part of this show’s monumental journey.

This
$60,000 raise is the key to the kingdom for us, it will provide
the makings of an elegant, vibrant
workshop/backers audition that displays the talents of the company
and the poignancy of the story for producers, investors & artistic directors. 
It
will pay for:



Union salaries of the large cast of ten
high-caliber performers and a stage manager for the concentrated rehearsal time
needed to translate the play and get it on it’s feet. 


Salaries for the sign master,
choreographer and company manager.


Rehearsal space for several weeks.   


HOWEVER  as you read this, we are
working through many channels,
including  our team at Mana-hq to raise the full amount that will allow us to move directly
into full production. 
If we
raise this greater amount, your $60,000 will
go into making the production that much better.  Every dollar will go towards upgrading the
show in terms of set, costumes, lighting and creative
captioning. 
Please note that while Indiegogo cannot accept checks, Fractured Atlas, our not-for-profit umbrella sponsor, can.   Please contact us if you would like to donate by check.

For a year starting September 1, 2014, I'm launching a funding campaign every 40 days. Nine organizations that mean something to me personally will benefit

MissionThe 40 Project is a charitable organization that creates and promotes fundraising campaigns for the time span between September 1, 2014 and September 1, 2015. Nine organizations with intrinsic personal connection to Jason Robert LeClair will benefit from this venture.

Description
On September 1, 2014, I am launching the first of 9 fundraising campaigns. Why the 40 project? I am turning 40 on September 1. For that year I want to give back. Every 40 days of my 40th year, I will be trying to raise at least $1,000 funds for nine causes that mean something to me. 
The nine fundraisers will be run through Indiegogo. All funds will be paid directly to the organizations. The organizations are as follows:

9/1/14 - 10/10/14 - Rhode Island Stage Ensemble10/11/14 - 11/19/14 - Walk for Life11/20/14 - 12/29/14 - Beacon Charter High School for the Arts12/30/14 - 2/7/15 - Educational Theatre Association2/8/15 - 3/19/15 - National Art Educators Foundation3/20/15 - 4/28/15 - Polycystic Kidney Disease Foundation4/29/15 - 6/8/15 - ASPCA6/9/15 - 7/19/15 - The Haitian Project7/20/15 - 8/29/15 - St. Thomas Food PantryThank you for your support of these amazing organizations trying to better our world in so many ways!

Our first cause is the Rhode Island Stage Ensemble   We're looking for $1,000
 What it will support is the ability for this amazing community theatre company (comprised of primarily volunteers) to keep going and growing. They are starting to launch a new education program that will impact the community of northern Rhode Island and nearby Massachusetts in a very positive way.
Arts enrichment for all ages and the ability to come together to learn new skills that can be applied to everyday life in a fun and safe environment is their goal. They use theatre to accomplish this. 

  The perks: RISE has donated several complimentary tickets and listings in their programs (over 3,000 people will see your name and/or company this season) as well as sponsorship listings for larger contributors to their website and facebook pages. They'll also send the largest contributors signed copies of all of this season's posters and programs (There may be a future star signing... you never know)!
It's the least we can do for your your help in allowing RISE to continue their mission of education and art.

Within 2 months we grew to 40 girls with a wait list for next year!</h2>
<p> </p>
<h2>WHAT WE DO<br/><br/>
</h2>
<h2>The Princess Academy is a program which introduces the arts through dance to at-risk, low income and interested families who want to see their girls grow in self-control, self-esteem, grace and power!</h2>
<h2>We focus on how to know Christ and live a life that honors HIM. We believe young girls can be modern yet modest, gentle, yet strong in a post-christian culture.</h2>
<div>
<h2>Being assessable to EVERYONE is our focus! 1/3 of our students are fully supported through scholarships, others receive reduced tuition and the remainder pay only $28 per month for a 1 hour class per week!</h2>
</div>
<h2>
<strong>Tami Kuenning, the director and lead instructor is an elementary school educator who saw a need to help girls find a fun and healthy outlet to explore the joy of dance in an age-appropriate, supportive and instructive environment.</strong><br/><br/><strong>Our motto at The Princess Academy is:  </strong>
</h2>
<h2>
<strong>""This is a safe place, where girls can be themselves, make new friends and take risks by trying new things without fear of judgment"". </strong><br/><br/><strong>OUR NEED</strong><br/><br/><strong>We need a wall of mirrors in our donated studio to help aid in proper instruction. The total cost for the mirrors are $1045. </strong><br/><br/><strong>After completing our first season - we have a long list of eager girls who are returning and more that want to join. </strong><br/><br/><strong>The girls are believing that there are enough people out there to help us achieve this goal!

Within 2 months we grew to 40 girls with a wait list for next year!
 
WHAT WE DO

The Princess Academy is a program which introduces the arts through dance to at-risk, low income and interested families who want to see their girls grow in self-control, self-esteem, grace and power!
We focus on how to know Christ and live a life that honors HIM. We believe young girls can be modern yet modest, gentle, yet strong in a post-christian culture.

Being assessable to EVERYONE is our focus! 1/3 of our students are fully supported through scholarships, others receive reduced tuition and the remainder pay only $28 per month for a 1 hour class per week!


Tami Kuenning, the director and lead instructor is an elementary school educator who saw a need to help girls find a fun and healthy outlet to explore the joy of dance in an age-appropriate, supportive and instructive environment.Our motto at The Princess Academy is:  


""This is a safe place, where girls can be themselves, make new friends and take risks by trying new things without fear of judgment"". OUR NEEDWe need a wall of mirrors in our donated studio to help aid in proper instruction. The total cost for the mirrors are $1045. After completing our first season - we have a long list of eager girls who are returning and more that want to join. The girls are believing that there are enough people out there to help us achieve this goal! It is my wish that they will not be disappointed! Thanks so much!

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>My name is Kate and I am launching a choreography project to be performed in Manhattan. Previously, I have worked as a choreographer for off-Broadway here in New York, but I wanted to try something different. No script, new ideas, and original music. </p>
<p>By funding rehearsal space, costumes, dancer and musician fees, you will help create a safe place for my choreographic journey to launch. </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>UPDATE: Our debut was scheduled for the Steps Lab November 3rd, but it must be moved due to Hurricane Sandy.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A good chunk of funds will go towards rehearsal space. New York renting is costly. Our rehearsal spaces range from $10 - $18 an hour. Our material, and means of creating is the collaboration of ideas in the space. About 35 hours of rehearsal time will go into this performance! </p>
<p>I have three dancers I need to costume with the help of the lovely Sally Lesser as designer. </p>
<p>I have at least three musicians and three dancers to pay. And I protest the thought of starving artist! </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>What's in in for you? </p>
<p>$1 - A shoutout on my website</p>
<p>$10 - Above and a NY postcard</p>

<p><strong>The First Gentleman</strong> is a hilarious new musical comedy, with a completely original book and score.  David Howard (Book and Lyrics) and Bret Simmons' (Composer) created this spectacular that will take you on a behind-the-scenes journey through the White House and into the lives of the most powerful family in the world.</p>

</ul><p><strong>Our Story </strong>is set in the not-too-distant future. West Virginia's senator, Kathryn Noel Cassidy, has just been elected the first female President of the United States. Kathryn, her husband Russell, and 15-year-old son Steven, are transplanted into the White House, and life, as they know it, will never be the same.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">For Russell and Steven, this is the first time they have ever been given this much attention, especially from the Media. Russell is thrust into a world of intense tradition, as he must now fulfill the duties held by the First Lady, such as hosting the Inaugural Tea, choosing dinnerware and attending an assortment of dedication ceremonies and events. Being an outdoorsman who likes to fish and hunt, Russell must find a way to adapt to his new environment, while maintaining his family's well being in and out of the media's eye. Steven doesn’t have it any easier. Being a regular 15-year-old kid is difficult enough, then add in a couple of secret service agents constantly tailing you.<br/><br/>The family is faced with a potentially devastating media crisis (caused by their son) and Russell rallies his staff to his aid.

FEEL the rhythm of feminine spirit united
SEE HERstory as it’s never been seen before  
 
Obeah Opera is a new all female a cappella opera conceived by Nicole Brooks, with music direction by Andrew Craig, based on the Salem witch trials and from the perspective of female slaves accused of practicing “obeah” (magic) in the Puritan town. The ground-breaking opera takes audiences on a spiritually sacred journey like no other seen on Canadian stages. 
After only 3 years on Toronto’s theatre circuit, Obeah Opera’s accolades are remarkable, just as the story itself.
2010/2011: workshop presentations received remarkable praise from both critics and audiences crossing cultures and generations. 
2012 daringly leaped to a fully staged, critically acclaimed production produced by b current and Theatre Archipelago and nominated for the 2012 Dora Mavor award for Best New Musical - a wonderful recognition of the work!
2013 Nicole and her team are back into development - enhancing the book, re-working the music and rehearsing a new workshop in May 2013.
 
HELP BUILD & SPREAD OBEAH OPERA’S MAGIC
 
Obeah Opera is still growing and needs your support over the next month. The creative heartbeat that exists behind this groundbreaking production is beating loudly, determined to see the work through to its next level.
 
Our goal is to raise $2,000 by May 26, 2013 so we can successfully workshop the piece with music director Andrew Craig and the cast of 15 amazingly talented singers including Neema Bickersteth, Saidah Baba Talibah, Saphire DeMitro, Angelique Lazarus, Nicole Brooks, and calypso queen Macomere Fifi.
 
We have already raised $7,000 from government sources and secured $2,500 from private donors for this portion of the development.  Please help us reach our goal!

More about Obeah Opera...THE FOLK TALE NEVER SUNG, UNTIL NOW
 
The first of its kind, Obeah Opera is an a cappella opera sung by an all female cast of 15 (features 5 soloists and a Greek chorus of 10).  The opera includes musical genres found in  Black music including jazz, blues, gospel, R&B, traditional African, Caribbean folk, spirituals etc..
 
An American now turned Caribbean tale, Obeah Opera allows the audience to experience the most famous witch hunt in mankind’s history through the voices of real historical women figures of that time who were ‘silenced’ or ‘dismissed’ as their accounts are barely recognized with a mere few sentences found in the historical books.  
 
The best known slave Tituba (referenced in all historical accounts of the hunt and trials including theatrical works such as the ‘The Crucible’) along with 3 other slave women  (Mary, Candy & Sarah) who were accused of practicing witchcraft, or more accurately Obeah, along with hundreds of other women, were sent to prison.  To aid the 4 women through the actual trials and tribulations is their own fairy Goddess Mother – The Elder (also based on a real historical character named Paula Del Cruz, a powerful healer known in Columbia), comes to their aid and helps them realize who they really are as women – healers. Reminding them the need to find their power regardless of their ‘station’ as a slave and being imprisoned, there is a call to stand up and be empowered.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>About This Campaign</h2>
<p>In 2009, five friends founded <a href=""http://www.theshelternyc.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Shelter</a> as a small theatre workshop to support themselves and other artists. In the ensuing years, The Shelter has grown and now houses nine staff members and fourteen resident artists working in several disciplines, including writing, directing, acting, and design. Our <a href=""http://www.theshelternyc.org/program/sunday/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sunday workshop</a> shelters a community of over one hundred members, whose work we have developed into six productions and multiple staged readings over the course of three seasons. We’ve filled over one thousand seats with engaged audience members, and critics have called our work <em>bold</em>, <em>creative</em>, <em>exciting</em>, <em>innovative</em>, <em>engaging</em>, and <em>solidly produced with exceptional production values</em>. In 2011, our production of <a href=""http://www.theshelternyc.org/production/fairy-tale/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FAIRY TALE</a> was selected as a <em>Backstage</em> Critic’s Pick.</p>
<p>While our shows have become ever more popular, ticket sales cover only 50% of our producing expenses. To fill the gap, we depend on people like you, who share our belief in the value of producing good theatre and sheltering artists. You’ve supported us in the past, and we’d like to partner with you again. We currently need to raise $10,000 for our fourth season. A donation of $50 pays for a costume, and a gift of $500 pays for one night's rental of a theatre. <strong>Your donation, at whatever level, can help us reach this goal.</strong></p>
<p>That $10,000 will enable us to produce three brand new shows in our fourth season, starting in December 2012 with <strong>SOARWARD HOLIDAY PARTY</strong>: a one-night-only, immersive, ensemble theatre experience built around an office holiday party – and we hope you’ll party with us! We’ll return in early 2013 with <strong>GHOST LIGHT</strong>, a collection of plays set on a bare stage below a single light. Finally, The Shelter will proudly premiere a piece that’s been over a year in the making at Shelter Sunday workshops: <strong>LILY &amp; KOSMO</strong>, a comedic space opera for all ages, performed in the style of a 1950s radio drama.</p>
<p>We want you to know how much we appreciate your support. That's why we've come up with some fun donor gifts, including signed <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/shelter4?c=gallery&amp;a=295192"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">original artwork</a> by LILY &amp; KOSMO creator <a href=""http://www.theshelternyc.org/person/jonathan-ashley/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Arthur Ashley</a>, free tickets to shows, and even <strong>a chance to be in one of our plays</strong>!

<h3>What Is MUNCHED?</h3>

court of public opinion. But she defiantly maintains her innocence. Her daughter, Katie, now a
wise-cracking, Star Trek-loving underachiever, unearths a box of
letters which her mother wrote her during the trial. In one, Marybeth pleads, “If you tell them about Flip Wilson, we’ll
be together again soon. I promise!” Thus the mystery

After 25 years, Marybeth Paxton has just been released from prison. A disturbing, widely publicized video helped convict her, both in the courthouse and the
court of public opinion. But she defiantly maintains her innocence. Her daughter, Katie, now a
wise-cracking, Star Trek-loving underachiever, unearths a box of
letters which her mother wrote her during the trial. In one, Marybeth pleads, “If you tell them about Flip Wilson, we’ll
be together again soon. I promise!” Thus the mystery
of “Flip Wilson!?” begins. Katie seeks the gory details--transcripts, interviews, videos--of her famous “sickness,"" which Marybeth was accused of inducing. The final, terrifying step for Katie is through
Marybeth’s front door.


MSBP (Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy)
is a psychological disorder in which a caregiver deceives a doctor into
treating her ward for an illness that she herself induced (think poisoning,
smothering, feces in an open wound...) in an effort to receive the attention,
affection, and status of being a hero.

Facing East is a new musical based on the stirring play by Carol Lynn Pearson that tells the story of an upstanding Mormon couple coming to terms with the suicide of their gay son. When they unexpectedly meet their son's lover, they must face a reality that until then has been ignored, and reconcile their feelings and beliefs.
Facing East: The Musical features a score by David Rigano (The Rigano Songbook), with book and lyrics by Mark Eugene Garcia (The Holy Cows Of Credence, South Dakota) and direction by Andrew Hobgood (Artistic Director of The New Colony in Chicago).

Facing East will receive a World Premiere Workshop/Development season in Chicago, IL, USA during August, 2011

The Impact
Facing East: The Musical brings to light themes of tolerance, acceptance, equality and understanding whilst dealing with the very serious issue of LGBT suicides, which has become somewhat of an epidemic over the last few years. Recently a string of suicides in young adults in the US due to bullying was brought to the attention of the public through the media, which has in turn seen a great outpouring of public support.

In response to this, and the subject matter of the show, all productions of Facing East: The Musical; including this workshop, intend to support The Trevor Project by sharing a portion of our profits with the organisation. The Trevor Project is the USA's leading national organisation providing crisis and suicide prevention services to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning youth. To find out more about The Trevor Project please visit their website.

Life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass. It’s about learning to dance in the rain. This dance began as a birthday celebration to get- my wonderful VP to  returning to work with my company and help turn all problems (Like Target claiming copyright to my work) to opportunities.
 
Please see a few of the wonderful rewards we are offering to make another trademark of mine, LEGAL LEMONADE®. I wish I could reach a million of you to donate even a dollar each and yes...we Davids CAN fight Goliath. Although I would rather shower them and you with KISSES. Here's a few:
 

 

  ""Your dancing leaves much to be desired -- YOU!""

 

 I have 35 years of experience of design, manufacturing social expression cards and gifts, product development for licensing, and designed displays that earn the most per square foot. My art and quotations are like loss leaders for the rest of the items that are displayed - consistently best sellers.
 
 I can help Target get good vendors here in the US and the best in China when we verify no one is exploited. This is a great opportunity. We have to get Target's attention. Ironically Target sponsors the Oprah show, the very essence of learning to dance in the rain.
 
Remember Eckart Tolle? The spiritual teacher whose book Oprah calls the most important she's ever read that launched her podcast? His literary agent is Bill Gladstone, who is my agent to. So is the message of my work which Target even put on the wall between Footsteps and the Serenity Prayer.
 
As Bill Gladstone said ""Vivian is on target. Too bad Target is missing the mark. Get it together Target and do the right thing.” 
""I would have gotten you a better present ..  If there was   more money in the kitty.""
You can help too. Show with a donation of any amount that you like my work, and want it in Target and other stores so we can spread the love far and wide.
My fans loyalty throughout the years - your comments, healing, and laughter are my greatest reward. But I think we need to show this to Target, and I would love nothing better than to share ALL of the rewards with you. Every donation shows another person who wants to make it right. And I'd like to show that creative people have the ability to create a better world.

  
 ""Happy Birthday - You're a real gift in my life.""
 Why $2420? It's the magic of   numerology for the numbers in  Linda's birthday, plus the service expense. We really really really want to see what you like and have your support to get TARGET to add many zeroes to these numbers so we can bring you tons of Kisses. Thanks for this opportunity!! Happy Birthday, Linda.
 
If you dont' have money, but you have time, we'll help you make money by sharing our campaign with your freinds.
Just let us know. A portion of all I do is to help others attend my workshops and benefit. Prosperity is free.

 - Your dancing leaves much to be desired - You!
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 - I would have gotten you a better present ..  If there was   more money in the kitty.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 - Happy Skinny Birthday! - With pounds of love
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 - Happy Birthday - You're a real gift in my life.

<h3>Why Donate to STAGEright?</h3>
<p>STAGEright was founded in 2009 by a group of friends seeking to work in a professional, intimate, and creative environment.  Since the beginning, STAGEright has focused on elevating the unique stories being told within each show produced and the dynamic character relationships found within these stirring stories.  Continually, STAGEright endeavors to take risks, provide opportunity, incite passion, and to produce good theatre.  Floyd Collins fits all of these criteria.</p>
<p>Floyd Collins was a legendary spelunker and true Kentucky county boy. In 1925, Floyd was seeking fame and fortune within an unexplored cavern when a rock wedged his foot against the cave wall and trapped the lone caver.  In this beautifully written musical we explore the ideas of freedom and entrapment, past and present, faith and despair, reality and dream, and finally life and death, all through the lens of a helpless family and a desperate entombed soul.</p>
<p>Your donation enables STAGEright to continue providing opportunities to local actors, musicians, designers, and directors.  Your donation helps fund Floyd Collins and future projects that build and impassion the Seattle arts community.   Your donation to STAGEright ensures the continuation of intimate, story-driven theatre.  </p>

<h3>As theatre artists, we have found a welcoming and warm home here at Bard College, and especially in the student-run theatrical space, The Old Gym. The annual Halloween show was the first piece we were involved in at Bard, and to be producing it now and carrying on this time honored tradition is a true thrill. We have amassed a company of passionate artists, all focused on creating a memorable, meaningful, and fun experience for the Bard community. We are driven and deeply motivated by our desire to produce the highest quality production as possible.</h3>
<h3>This year, our student directors are devising adaptations of Hansel and Gretel, Snow White, The Little Mermaid, Little Red Riding Hood, Rumpelstiltskin, and Peter Pan and his Shadow. Currently we are raising money to pay for the materials necessary to mount the production.</h3>
<h3>The money we raise will enable us to buy the following: Curtains (necessary to build the individual rooms which the adaptations will take place in) Costumes. Make-up. Crucial building supplies (nails, tools, paint). Props. All of the money we raise will be spent go towards buying necessary supplies for the show. Without the help of donations, we simply do not have the resources to see this show through.</h3>
<h3>Any and all donations are extremely appreciated. Please feel free to spread the word about Grimm Haus as well! We will premiere October 27th and 28th in the Old Gym!</h3>

<h2>The Project</h2>
<p>JOHNNY &amp; the DEVIL’S BOX is a folk musical about a brash young square dance fiddler from Georgia who must navigate young love, evade corrupt revenuers and outwit a devilish preacher on his quest to prove himself as the best fiddler that has ever been. But Johnny’s pride may be his downfall, and if he takes his fiddle out of the mountains what music will be left for his town to dance to?  Inspired by myths of fiddlers’ dealing with the Devil, this piece takes a hard look at the association between a virtuoso’s pride and hellish temptation. Told largely through Appalachian inspired myth, music and movement the show is built to stir the audience’s urge to get up and dance.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The People</h2>
<p>JOHNNY &amp; the DEVIL’S BOX is the dream and passion project of Douglas Waterbury-Tieman, an actor-musician and writer living in New York City who hails from Lexington, Kentucky.  It is his dream to bring a musical to the stage that can bridge the space between the city he calls home and the southern roots he keeps planted in the bluegrass. The rest of the JDB team includes music supervisor Scott Wasserman (Margaritaville, Dear Evan Hansen), director John Hurley, and choreographer Jennifer Jancuska (Hamilton).  </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Goal</h2>
<p>Our ultimate goal is to secure the funds and artistic support for a premiere production.  This means communicating with people who are trying to envision the world of JOHNNY &amp; the DEVIL’S BOX and all of the potential it holds. Because a live musical is a full sensory experience we are producing a music video as part of a new website that will serve as a digital portal to express the heart and vibrant vision of the JDB team as we communicate with producers and backers.  By supporting the vision of this music video you will be helping to bring this show into reality.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>The Video</h2>
<p>The video will utilize the skill and vision of choreographer Jennifer Jancuska and her company The BringAbout accompanied by Douglas’ original music as performed by Broadway’s premier bluegrass band The Playbillies.  The video will be produced and filmed by the team behind PostModern Jukebox’s award winning one take video of Don’t Stop Believin’.  In order to produce this video we will need to raise at least $5,000.  These funds are needed for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Studio recording fees</li>
<li>Space rental</li>
<li>Film equipment</li>
<li>Director fees</li>
<li>Artist stipends</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Perks</h2>
<p>As thanks for your support we are offering early access to tracks from our recent concert, bluegrass fiddle lessons, free tickets to upcoming events, and your name used in the actual script!</p> <h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>JOHNNY &amp; the DEVIL’S BOX is a story about the power of music and dance to unite a community.  By supporting this music video you will be helping to celebrate the rich history of Americana folk music and ensure the continuation of the musical theatre art form.</p> <h2>The Challenge</h2>
<p>We are not so naive as to think that this campaign and video will be easy an easy task.  We are well aware of the challenges faced by all creative projects including lack of funding and fast approaching deadlines.  However, we are a professional and close knit team who are ready to think on our feet and roll with the punches. We have already self produced two concerts at Rockwood Music Hall, multiple table readings and a full staged reading of the script at Belmont University.  Should we come up short or be faced with any other unforeseen challenges we will use our expertise to rise above them.</p> <h2>The Song</h2>
<p>Even if you are unable to support us financially we can still use your help!  Please share our campaign on social media and by word of mouth. We are not just funding a music video we are launching a project that we hope will fill theaters with song and dance for years to come.  We hope that you will join us and help to sing “That Glorious Song” in whatever way you can!</p>

Where are you? What is the weather like? Who do you see? What do you feel? The memory of last Sunday probably comes back very quickly so now we go even further back.""</b></p>
<p><b>- from MNEMONIC</b><br/></p>
<p>How reliable are memory and imagination, the most subjective of storytellers, in recapturing the past? Crossing continents and centuries, MNEMONIC's frayed narrative weaves together the discovery of Ötzi the iceman, a woman's search for her absent father and the longing for a love lost. By persistently exploring ""how we remember, what we remember, why we remember,"" MNEMONIC calls us to question not only who we are but where we ultimately come from. </p>
<p>Red Tape Theatre, now in its 11th Season, is committed to the 
creation of new and experimental work. Red Tape’s productions invite our
 audiences to re-imagine their world. Our work serves a vital 
purpose in our community: to arrest attention and create empathy. <br/></p>
<p>With the<b> Chicago Premiere </b>of MNEMONIC (September 2-October 5, 2014) we'll be re-imagining this devised piece, originally conceived by Complicite.  We want to give this amazing play an equally amazing Chicago run, and we need your help to do it! Besides, <b>look at those </b><b>prizes</b>.
</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary ""Think back to a time which is not very long ago. Last Sunday morning. You wake up. Where are you? What is the weather like? Who do you see? What do you feel? The memory of last Sunday probably comes back very quickly so now we go even further back.""
- from MNEMONIC
How reliable are memory and imagination, the most subjective of storytellers, in recapturing the past? Crossing continents and centuries, MNEMONIC's frayed narrative weaves together the discovery of Ötzi the iceman, a woman's search for her absent father and the longing for a love lost. By persistently exploring ""how we remember, what we remember, why we remember,"" MNEMONIC calls us to question not only who we are but where we ultimately come from. 
Red Tape Theatre, now in its 11th Season, is committed to the 
creation of new and experimental work. Red Tape’s productions invite our
 audiences to re-imagine their world. Our work serves a vital 
purpose in our community: to arrest attention and create empathy. 
With the Chicago Premiere of MNEMONIC (September 2-October 5, 2014) we'll be re-imagining this devised piece, originally conceived by Complicite.  We want to give this amazing play an equally amazing Chicago run, and we need your help to do it! Besides, look at those prizes.

  What We Need & What You Get We're facing a unique season in our 11th year...the first in a long time where we don't have a place to call home.  With this new situation we face significantly higher production costs.  We are now experiencing expenses such as rehearsal space rental ($1000) and ongoing storage costs for our lighting and set equipment ($150/month).  In addition to these are the expected expenses of producing theatre, such as purchasing producing rights ($1700), paying actor & designer stipends and buying set supplies & materials.  Producing plays on the technically impressive level Red Tape is known for requires funds. 
For all of your amazing generosity, support, and belief in RTT, you'll receive some pretty sweet swag like tickets to MNEMONIC, Segway Tours, Gift Certificates to restaurants in the Loop area so you can enjoy dinner before or after the show, and even an overnight stay at a Loop area hotel so you can make a night of it!

<p>Writer Janet Goddard
and composer Gretchen Hewitt have teamed up and created a dynamic musical and
are ready to share it with the world, but they need your help.  Getting a
musical produced is no easy task, but Janet and Gretchen have a plan.
 Their first goal is to get the story and music to the people! The story
is magical, the music is marvelous. </p>
<p>Your contribution can
make that happen.  Their goal this summer is to make a professional audio
storybook recording.  This will allow Janet and Gretchen to share the
story and music with you and with all story lovers, music lovers, musical
theater lovers,  directors, and producers around the world.  </p>
<p>Don't you want to hear
a good story through drama and song?  Help Janet and Gretchen share the
story of The Mechanical Cat.  </p>
<p><b>Here's Why We Need You</b></p>
<p>The name of the game
is collaboration in making a musical.  It takes a lot of talent and costs
a good deal of money to create such a recording. It's important  to
 compensate all of the collaborative talents involved in this project.
 Gretchen and Janet need to pay for studio time, a sound recorder/mixer,
actors (6 plus), and a musician to make this recording a success.  That's
where they need your support.   </p>
<p>Your contributions,
large and small, will help pay for this professional recording and will support
the arts in a truly hands-on kind of way.  How
many people can say that they invested in artists by supporting a totally
original, up-and-coming musical?  You can, if you want to.    </p>
<p>If Gretchen and Janet
don't reach their goal, they will both have to come up with the money another
way, which will not be easy, and which will slow progress for the cat in a big
way.  If you want to hear the story by the end of summer, your donation
will make the difference.  </p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>There is room in this
world for all the art we can possibly give it.  Gretchen and Janet have a
story that has something for everyone to enjoy, ponder, feel, and hear.
 </p>
<p>This musical is
completely original.  It is important to continue filling our world with
original ideas.  You won't find anything like it.  It isn't a remake
of an old story (though many of those are wonderful).  It's completely
original.  You will be contributing  to bringing a totally original
story into the world. Once you hear it, you'll agree that it is a story worth
listening to.  </p>
<p>Gretchen and Janet
have already presented the musical to the Women in the Arts Conference at
UM-St. Louis in 2011 to good success. They have work-shopped and revised the
script and the music.  In other words, it is in strong form and ready for
its next step.  </p>
<p><b>It Isn't All About Money</b></p>
<p>Gretchen and Janet
know that not everyone is in a position to contribute financially (after all,
not having the finances themselves is why they need this campaign in the first
place),  but that doesn't mean your help is not just as important.
 You can help the cause by simply passing along this information and
helping Gretchen and Janet get the story and music out and make connections
with people who are interested and who care.  Who knows?  Maybe they
will support the project. </p>
<p>Once the recording is
made, a whole other kind of support will be needed--sharing the story and music
with others.  That should be a pleasure for everyone. </p>
<p>Give a lot.  Give
a little.  Talk it up.  Whatever you do, please support The
Mechanical Cat</p><br/></div>","The Mechanical Cat

theater lovers,  directors, and producers around the world.  
Don't you want to hear
a good story through drama and song?  Help Janet and Gretchen share the
story of The Mechanical Cat.  
Here's Why We Need You
The name of the game
is collaboration in making a musical.  It takes a lot of talent and costs
a good deal of money to create such a recording. It's important  to
 compensate all of the collaborative talents involved in this project.
 Gretchen and Janet need to pay for studio time, a sound recorder/mixer,
actors (6 plus), and a musician to make this recording a success.  That's
where they need your support.   
Your contributions,
large and small, will help pay for this professional recording and will support
the arts in a truly hands-on kind of way.  How
many people can say that they invested in artists by supporting a totally
original, up-and-coming musical?  You can, if you want to.    
If Gretchen and Janet
don't reach their goal, they will both have to come up with the money another
way, which will not be easy, and which will slow progress for the cat in a big
way.  If you want to hear the story by the end of summer, your donation
will make the difference.  
The Impact
There is room in this
world for all the art we can possibly give it.  Gretchen and Janet have a
story that has something for everyone to enjoy, ponder, feel, and hear.
 
This musical is
completely original.  It is important to continue filling our world with
original ideas.  You won't find anything like it.  It isn't a remake
of an old story (though many of those are wonderful).  It's completely
original.  You will be contributing  to bringing a totally original
story into the world. Once you hear it, you'll agree that it is a story worth
listening to.  
Gretchen and Janet
have already presented the musical to the Women in the Arts Conference at
UM-St. Louis in 2011 to good success. They have work-shopped and revised the
script and the music.  In other words, it is in strong form and ready for
its next step.  
It Isn't All About Money
Gretchen and Janet
know that not everyone is in a position to contribute financially (after all,
not having the finances themselves is why they need this campaign in the first
place),  but that doesn't mean your help is not just as important.
 You can help the cause by simply passing along this information and
helping Gretchen and Janet get the story and music out and make connections
with people who are interested and who care.  Who knows?  Maybe they
will support the project. 
Once the recording is
made, a whole other kind of support will be needed--sharing the story and music
with others.  That should be a pleasure for everyone. 
Give a lot.  Give
a little.  Talk it up.  Whatever you do, please support The

I can’t say whether it was divine inspiration, or, just my brain trying to find a higher level of activity other than asking what side dish people wanted with their steak. Regardless, it has been an incredible journey ever since. I want to tell a story. I want to take you away from the world you’re currently living in; away from any troubles or worries or constant bombardment of hate and fear and crime from news channels and the internet. Why not follow an eight-year-old as she becomes friends with the most unlikeliest of people? Why not watch a grown man’s heart melt as he learns to love someone he never thought he could love? Why not watch a family come together and fall in love with each other all over again? Imaginary has grown so much since its inception six years ago. Now the creative team and the production team are ready to share it with all of you, and beyond. Please help us to fund this show and bring a little imagination back. Help us to spread a message of love and friendship to a world that needs it. Help everyone who has worked on this project to tell its story.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Imaginary Needs and Gives</strong></p>
<p>We need $4500. Why? Expenses a-gogo. We are producing a backers' audition for Imaginary in hopes that we can get some interested folks to back our project. Our ultimate goal is to have a commercial run of Imaginary.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2><span><strong>Origins of Me and Caesar Lee</strong></span></h2>
<p><span></span></p>
<h4>ME AND CAESAR LEE is an all original new musical. </h4>
<p>Pat Holley, life-long musician and singer, wrote the music, lyrics, and book as a response to what she observed in theater: an absence of meaningful roles for African American performers. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This new musical comedy/drama made its fully staged reading debut at the Tony-winning Crossroads Theater Company in New Brunswick, New Jersey (Outstanding Regional Theater). It starred the legendary, two-time Tony nominee, Ernestine Jackson, as Camille Lambert, and its extensive development throughout the following years was assisted by Julia Miles (Founder, The Women’s Project Theater); Tony Award winner, Lillias White (The Life); AUDELCO Award winner, Billie Allen (Saint Lucy’s Eyes); Brenda Pressley (And The World Goes Round); arranger/ composer, A. Dennis Williams; AUDELCO Award winner, Petronia Paley (Cherry Orchard); acclaimed dramaturge, Sydne Mahone; AUDELCO Award winner, Lynda Gravatt (Crowns); and other prominent actors and theater administrators.</p><p> </p>
<h2><span><strong>The Project</strong></span></h2>
<p><span></span></p>
<p>After many self-produced and self-financed readings, staged readings, and performances, including a highly successful 2011 song concert, Divas and Friends Sing Songs from Me and Caesar Lee, at the Triad Theater in NYC, Me and Caesar Lee was invited to participate in the Midtown International Theatre Festival (MITF) in 2013. It was a wonderful opportunity to showcase this inspirational musical and to fulfill the G. Gebony Productions mission- to broaden the scope for African-American women in theatre. The production was postponed, because Ms. Holley needed an emergency eye operation. Me and Caesar Lee is coming to the New York City stage in the summer, 2014.</p>
<p>We need to raise $15,000 to cover the costs of promotions, festival fees, and payment for the cast and crew of the upcoming production. In addition to covering the expenses of a summer production, these funds will put us on track to giving Me and Caesar Lee the off-Broadway run it deserves.

Gebony Productions presents: Me and Caesar Lee!
 
Origins of Me and Caesar Lee

ME AND CAESAR LEE is an all original new musical. 
Pat Holley, life-long musician and singer, wrote the music, lyrics, and book as a response to what she observed in theater: an absence of meaningful roles for African American performers. 

This new musical comedy/drama made its fully staged reading debut at the Tony-winning Crossroads Theater Company in New Brunswick, New Jersey (Outstanding Regional Theater). It starred the legendary, two-time Tony nominee, Ernestine Jackson, as Camille Lambert, and its extensive development throughout the following years was assisted by Julia Miles (Founder, The Women’s Project Theater); Tony Award winner, Lillias White (The Life); AUDELCO Award winner, Billie Allen (Saint Lucy’s Eyes); Brenda Pressley (And The World Goes Round); arranger/ composer, A. Dennis Williams; AUDELCO Award winner, Petronia Paley (Cherry Orchard); acclaimed dramaturge, Sydne Mahone; AUDELCO Award winner, Lynda Gravatt (Crowns); and other prominent actors and theater administrators. 
The Project

After many self-produced and self-financed readings, staged readings, and performances, including a highly successful 2011 song concert, Divas and Friends Sing Songs from Me and Caesar Lee, at the Triad Theater in NYC, Me and Caesar Lee was invited to participate in the Midtown International Theatre Festival (MITF) in 2013. It was a wonderful opportunity to showcase this inspirational musical and to fulfill the G. Gebony Productions mission- to broaden the scope for African-American women in theatre. The production was postponed, because Ms. Holley needed an emergency eye operation. Me and Caesar Lee is coming to the New York City stage in the summer, 2014.
We need to raise $15,000 to cover the costs of promotions, festival fees, and payment for the cast and crew of the upcoming production. In addition to covering the expenses of a summer production, these funds will put us on track to giving Me and Caesar Lee the off-Broadway run it deserves. These funds will be used solely for the purposes of furthering the production of Me and Caesar Lee, and your donations and support are gratefully received. If we raise more than our intended goal of $15,000, the additional funds will be directed to later productions of Me and Caesar Lee. You can see more about the show at meandcaesarlee.com.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Your generous contribution will help ""Raise The Curtain"" on TE San Pedro Rep's production of HAMLET - opening November 14th, 2013!</p>
<p><strong>The Goal: $1,000 for the show's production budget and marketing efforts!</strong></p>

<p>
</p><h3> </h3>
<h3>The Production</h3>
<p>Incorporating elements of physical theatre, Commedia, and a powerful command of language, TE San Pedro Rep (TESPR) presents a bold and imaginative retelling of Shakespeare's greatest work, HAMLET, directed by MARTIN JAGO.</p>
<p>TESPR's production of Hamlet will bring an international ensemble of artists together, lead its audience on an unyielding journey of discovery into a sensory exploration of the physical and the elemental and will dare to examine anew the universal themes that lie at the heart of Hamlet, such as Time and its existential narrative that runs like a thread through the fabric of the play.</p>
<p>To play the play is to hold a mirror up to nature in the most literal of senses, since Time itself is at the heart of the theatrical event. It is that shared experience, a breath, a transient moment never to be repeated that is, in a sense, the world of the play as much as it is our own existence.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Wapsipinicon Theatre Festival is a week long theatre experience(experiment) We create a work in rural Iowa (Independence Iowa) in a week and show it to the local community. This is not a community that has arts and theatre coming to it's doorstep often.</p>
<p>I am a theatre artist, deviser, clown, and amateur aerialist. I am trying to bring my skills and enthusiasm to this community. Like many artists, I am poor. Like many festivals for audiences outside of large urban centers Wapsi is under funded. This campaign is to help me travel to and eat in Iowa.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I just need a little bit of funding to help cover airfare, busfare, and food. I cannot offer a lot of cool prizes,but ill try to offer some goofy incentives. Even a couple of bucks will help me fly over the Wapsipinicon River as people travel down it by canoe and experience their own arts odyssey.</p>
<p>Here is the breakdown of the fundage</p>
<p>$400- Airfare</p>
<p>$40 - Busfare</p>
<p>$52- Indiegogo fees</p>
<p>$108- food and miscellany</p>

<p>A
rundown of what you're supporting:</p>
<p>Airline
fare =6 tickets x $200 per ticket = $1,200</p>
<p>Hotel
= 2 Rooms x 2 nights x $200 each = $800</p>
<p>Food
= $80 per person (For two days full of meals) x 6 people = $480</p>
<p>Transportation
- $20 x 6 = $120</p><p>9% fee to Indiegogo = $234</p>
<p>For
a grand total of $2,834!  </p>
<p>All the money will go towards funding this
trip. Barren Mind is a nationally recognized college improv troupe, seriously

<h2>SWEET PERKS! </h2>
<p>More of our perks are listed below but
basically we want to reward your support! For your help we have perks like
personalized thank you notes from Barren Mind, a thank you Snapchat from the
cast, the chance to be in a Barren Mind show, and much more!  </p>
<h1><b>The Impact</b></h1>
<p>Why
help a bunch of college improvisers? Because you will be helping a group of
best friends who are more than passionate about comedy make their dreams become
a reality. Also, because Barren Mind is truly one of THE premiere teams of
SUN DEVIL Nation; and great teams should be supported! Name another ASU team
that's been ranked in the top twelve in the country three consecutive years. Name another ASU
team that has been to the finals of a national tournament three out of the last
four years. YOUR support will help us continue to
represent Arizona State University in the world of COLLEGE IMPROV!</p>
<h1><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></h1>
<p>The
most important characteristics of a great improv troupe are support and trust. Coincidentally
those characteristics are just as important to this campaign. We want you to
trust our mission because we are passionate about achieving our goal. We
understand support comes in a lot of ways and funds may be low so please spread
the word of our campaign through social media. Please use Indiegogo share tools
and help spread our story to the world!</p>
