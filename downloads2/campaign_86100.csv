<p>I’m Jasmine Jordan and my debut EP of

January.  Feel free to head over to my brand new website,

TRAVEL directed by Andric Booker. You can also download TIME TRAVEL
through the email list at the top right.<br/><br/>
Since moving to Los Angeles after obtaining my Bachelor of Science Degree in
Business Administration, I have actively been pursuing my dream of having a
solo music career.  Over the past two years I have been
searching for my new sound and connecting with people who share my passion for
making great quality music.<br/><br/>
Despite my devotion to music, recording an album is not an easy task, and there
are many expenses that come along with building my brand and expanding my
career. While I am continuously investing time and energy into making this
project the best that it can be, financially I still need a little help. 
Any donation will help bring me closer to not only releasing high quality music
that I can be proud of, but more importantly music that you can enjoy. <br/><br/>
This project was produced and recorded entirely in Los Angeles by Andre de
Santanna, and features an amazing cast of
musicians that he handpicked for the project:<br/><br/>
Drums: Lyndon Rochelle (Esperanza Spalding, George Duke)<br/>
Drums: Tamir Barzilay (Macy Gray)<br/>
Bass: Andre de Santanna (Jason Mraz, Sergio Mendez, Gretchen Parlato)<br/>
Keys: Bryan Velasco (Celia Cruz, Tito Puente, Everlast)<br/>Background Vocals: Danielle DeAndrea (Sting, Kylie Minogue, Jackson Brown)<br/>
Guitar: Jon Maurer (Sugar Water Purple)<br/></p><p><br/></p><h2><span>What We Need</span></h2><p><span></span><span>At this point you may be wondering what
exactly are the costs involved with releasing an EP. Besides hard work and dedication,

associated with getting on my feet as an artist. Any help you can provide

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Cen'C Love. I am a musician (guitar, piano, percussions), singer, and songwriter.  This is my second full length LP (""Love Letter"", 2011), and first Acoustic album, and I am happy to feature my friends, The Tuff Gang, who are also talented songwriters individually: Yezer Root (guitar, bass, percussions, flute), Asadenaki (guitar, percussions), Narry Berry (keyboard, percussions), and Ayeola George (harmony, though everyone sings harmony, really!).    </p>
<p>We are in the process of producing a 'tribute' LP, ""STRANGE"", (check out the VIDEO in Gallery section above) in observation of the plight of all indigenous nations around the world.  With the expansion of globalism/capitalism, indigenous tribes are being forced to come to terms with a devastating reality that threatens their history, traditions, natural habitat, and their very existence.  Genocide; spiritual, mental, AND physical, has been their worst nightmare come alive.  Though gravely downtrodden throughout colonial history, they still haven't given up the fight.  Through our Music we are here to show our undying love and support for the original peoples who are the genuine caretakers of Mother Earth.  We would love to share our special gifts with the world of loving people, WITH YOUR SUPPORT!</p>

<p>We have already composed all the music we want to feature, and we plan to record live and organic, without the use of electronic instruments (but with mics and computers of course). Now we need a significant boost to actualize our concept : Recording, Mixing+Mastering, CD duplication, and Online Distribution, can be quite a load for unsigned artists, but we know fans like you believe in us enough to help make it happen! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We took some time to work out a practical budget to get all this done in good time. We want to have a physical product by August 2013, which is the month for International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples, and before most other Indigenous Month celebrations observed in specific territories.  We calculated that $8000 should take care of the production and duplication costs.</p>
<p> For your love and support we have special gifts: free downloads, signed copies of the official LP (once production is complete August 2013), buttons, autographed posters, and t-shirts with album artwork, and if you decide to be extremely generous, you will receive a custom ""nomad sack""- a drawstring bag the size of a rolled up yoga mat, made with authentic indigenous textiles, shells, and stones, and custom hand-engraved calabash bowls from Jamaica (for a real native feel!).</p>
<p>IF WE DO NOT REACH OUR ENTIRE GOAL of $8000 we will still find a way to supplement what we recieve.  This project is a mission for us and we will do all in our power to make it happen.  Every little bit helps! For our contributors,($35 and up) until we complete this production, we will still make available hand-engraved Calabash bowls for keep-sakes!</p>

<h3>The Symposium:  Giving the Canadian a Chance! </h3>
<p>Hello everyone, and first off welcome!  </p>
<p>What this campaign is about is aiding in my attendance at the 2013 Oregon Bach Festival Composers Symposium.  I was selected to be one of the composers at this conference, and was also commissoned to write a new piece for it.  The piece will be performed and recorded as part of the Symposium, and I will have the opportunity to learn from many professionals in the industry during my 12 day stay.</p>
<p>I'm very grateful and excited that you've considered joining me on this part of my journey!  I am grateful to have the opportunity to have a new work premiered in the United States (a first for me), to have the opportunity to study under Grammy Award Winner Stephen Hartke, and to share and learn with other composers!!  I believe that when these opportunities show up in our lives, it is important for us to do everything in our power to make them reality. </p>
<p>Not only is this a chance to learn and attend the conference, but I will also be able to return with a something tangible; a professional score and recording.  <strong>Something I can share with you.</strong></p>
<p>For those who do not know much about me, I am a student of Dr. Derek Charke at Acadia University.  I am entering my fourth year of study with a CGPA of 3.51 (4 being the highest), and will be studying abroad at the University of Freiburg in Germany.  During my year in Germany I will study music composition, classical guitar, and Germanistik (German language/history), and upon my return will graduate with two bachlor degrees.  I intend to acquire my masters degree in music composition, write for film, by commission, for self, and perhaps teach at the University level.  </p>
<p><br/>It is very important for me to do this, composing is what I aim to do with the rest of my life and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your contribution and support! </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">THE MATH </strong></p>
<p>I have put together a costs list, and I have concluded it will take me close to $2000 CDN to achieve my goal.  The flight itself is $1000, the conference $520, and room/board, as well as food expenses bring the total number to around $2000 Canadian. </p>
<p>What is really cool is that is my first real exposure outside of Canada, and a great opportunity to earn some hands on knowledge! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>WHY YOU SHOULD SPONSOR?</strong></h3>
<p>You are providing me with the resources to be a part of a great opportunity to learn and grow both as a person, and as a musician!  I will be able to share with the other composers, and with you, just what I do!  Thanks to <strong>you, </strong>it will be possible.  Isn't that something worth investing in?  Regardless, I will be eternally grateful to you. </p>
<p>I'm offering more than just a thanks, below is a chart of what I can do to give back to you!  </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>First off, I really want to thank all of y'all for making my dreams come true. These past 3 years have been unbelievable. None of it would be possible with y'all.  We're proud of our first record but it's def time for a new one. As you know, Y'ALL ARE OUR RECORD LABEL! Without your support, we'd have nothing!  We need some help from our outlaw family. We're recording a new album in June. We plan on doing cds and vinyl. However, in order for us to make it to the next level as an independant band, we must fund our own radio campaigns to make sure it's heard.  Your contributions will go towards all of this plus our next videos and touring transportation. We're hoping the new product will help push us nation wide.  Even if you can't afford to help financially, the sharing of this campaign will help a lot! We thank you all in advance!</p>

<p><i>""The Catskill Jazz Factory program is a remarkable opportunity for the children on the mountaintop. This really gives the kids a chance to connect things they have learned in the classroom with the outside world. Listening to live jazz - rather than on their iPods or YouTube - brings a broader sense of music and its possibilities directly into their world.  Thank you so much for this wonderful opportunity!!!""</i><br/><b>-Shannon Hoyt, Hunter-Tannersville Elementary Music Department</b></p>
<p><i>
“With
this type of program, what they’re [CJF] trying got cultivate isn’t necessarily a
thing where you show up one summer, you’re there for a week, and then your name
is on the back of the 2013 T-shirt and that’s it, you never hear from them
again. They are trying to cultivate different performance opportunities here,
really create a community in the sense that every musician that’s been through
this program, you’re building a base. You’re building a family.”</i><br/><b>-Benny Benack III, trumpeter and CJF residency alum</b></p>

Catskill Jazz Factory is a non-profit program founded in 2012 by Hudson Valley residents Piers & Lucy Playfair.



WE ENCOURAGE children and new audiences to participate at live performances. By partnering with schools, arts & community organizations, and local businesses, we offer in-school workshops and concerts, present in traditional and non-traditional venues, and fund a ticket subsidy program.


WE SUPPORT top young jazz artists with artist residencies, performance opportunities, and recording capability.


WE PRESENT at diverse venues to introduce world-class musicians to our region.




In Three Years our Achievements have been Phenomenal



WORKED with 18 schools across 6 Hudson Valley school districts 

PARTNERED with 17 regional & local arts and community organizations

PRESENTED at 18 venues throughout the Hudson Valley to diverse audiences

HIRED 81 Jazz musicians 

EMPLOYED 14 people and WORKED ALONGSIDE countless volunteers

""The Catskill Jazz Factory has the potential to be a model, not just for jazz and not just for Tannersville, but an example to show what art and a community of people in collaboration can do for the betterment of the human spirit"". -Aaron Diehl, 2011 American Pianists Association Cole Porter Fellow in Jazz & founding CJF Artistic Director



Celebrate our Success and Support this Campaign!
This year will be our busiest yet and we need your support! Our campaign goal is $15,000 and every penny raised will go towards educational workshops, artist residencies, ticket subsidies, album recordings, and creative projects.
The Catskill Jazz Factory is a non-profit program, meaning that ALL donations to our campaign are tax-deductible and you'll automatically receive a receipt upon your donation.




   

The Impact


 Hear from musicians and community members about the impact we have made:
""The Catskill Jazz Factory program is a remarkable opportunity for the children on the mountaintop. This really gives the kids a chance to connect things they have learned in the classroom with the outside world. Listening to live jazz - rather than on their iPods or YouTube - brings a broader sense of music and its possibilities directly into their world.  Thank you so much for this wonderful opportunity!!!""-Shannon Hoyt, Hunter-Tannersville Elementary Music Department

“With
this type of program, what they’re [CJF] trying got cultivate isn’t necessarily a
thing where you show up one summer, you’re there for a week, and then your name
is on the back of the 2013 T-shirt and that’s it, you never hear from them
again. They are trying to cultivate different performance opportunities here,
really create a community in the sense that every musician that’s been through
this program, you’re building a base. You’re building a family.”-Benny Benack III, trumpeter and CJF residency alum


""The Catskill Jazz Factory provided an once-in-a-lifetime experience for over 100 students in the Kingston City School District with a year-long artist residency, which culminated in a performance pairing students, educators and top notch jazz artists.

<div>I've made a new record, and I feel that it's some of my best work to date. For now, I'm calling it ""Safe and Sound,"" although the title may change. The songs are about trusting in what fate has in store, despite the temptation to lose faith; they're also about deep true love, the kind that doesn't come around every day. (You'll be happy to know there are only two breakup songs on this record! And one is a cover!). I had a blast collaborating with some incredibly talented producers and musicians on this project, including the amazing Oliver Newell, Josh Merrill, Stevie Blacke (Beck, Rhianna), and Rick Parker (Lord Huron, Ravonettes, BRMC). We recorded in a vintage airstream trailer-turned-studio in a magical orange grove up in Ojai, California, in a cozy home studio in Beachwood Canyon in the Hollywood Hills, and in a state of the art recording studio. </div>

<div>I hope to release the record in late fall. If a label comes on board, that would be great; either way, I want to ensure that no matter what, I will have the means to make this release count. It is an incredibly eye-opening experience to realize just how expensive it is, in today's crowded music climate, to make a mark, and to have your voice heard, through the noise of the many new artists all over the internet. This requires some degree of marketing and publicity, to stand out. The conundrum is that in this day and age, in which music is basically free to consumers, the role of the traditional record label in developing artists' careers is no longer viable, except in a few cases -- usually highly commercial, pop entities. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">The bottom line is that no matter how great the music turns out, if no one knows about it, then all the hard work and passion go by the wayside. </span>

<div>I would like to release this record in a way that will bring attention to it, and give it its due. To bring this project to fruition, I need to rely upon my own resourcefulness, and craft a strategic plan to<span style=""background-color: initial;""> help spread the word about it. Hiring a team of publicists, marketing companies, and radio promoters amount to many thousands of dollars more than I would be able to come up with via my yoga-teaching and piano-teaching day jobs! This is why I decided that it is now time to include my community in this process, and to raise funds here via indiegogo, to give myself a chance to get put this record on the map. I'm looking toward a release date in late October/ early November of this year. That will give me just about enough time to raise the funding, hire the team, and plan and (begin to) execute the steps needed to bring attention to the album. </span>

In order to complete the album, I need to fully fund the final recording elements (background vocals and some additional instrumentation) but most crucially, the back end production costs: mixing, mastering, pressing, photograhy, artwork, and the costs relative to an album release concert in August/September (pending venue availability) such as musicians, singers, rehearsal space, and other administrative fees. I have estimated that I need to raise $12,000.00 to ensure that the album is able to drop by end of summer 2014. A Dirty Laundry track:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY4lQmen46QA Good Clean Music track:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWTJMkJPlKoAlbum ImpactI am a lifelong fan of the album format. As kid, nothing thrilled me more than going to the record store, buying a new album by my favorite artist, taking it home, unwrapping it, pouring over the artwork, liner notes (including the acknowledgments) and reading the lyrics as I listened to a whole work that was constructed to tell a kind of story around a theme. Nowadays it seems most albums are centered around individual hits and individual hits are great but I'm deeply passionate giving you the whole enchilada. Not only do I aim to make Dirty Laundry Good Clean Music a tangible calling card for me but also an artistic touchstone for your music collection so please consider throwing a few bucks my way. It will be so worth it. Get in on the ground floor! How Else Can You Help?Follow me on Facebook and Twitter. Find out more about me, my music, and my collaborators on www.thelivingmichaeljackson.com.

How the music moved you? Or how the lyrics felt like they were speaking right to your heart giving you language to understand your life that you didn't have before? Has a song ever whispered to you some word that kept you going in sorrow? </p><p>That's why I became a songwriter 15 years ago. It's why I picked up a guitar more than 20 years ago. Life is beautiful, life can be so full of sorrow. Those times when a song rises up in the middle of joy or pain to help us understand who we are and what life is really about are a great gift. Will you help me make my next album? </p><p><font color=""#000000"" size=""5""><span style=""letter-spacing: 1.440000057220459px; line-height: 30px;""><b>What does it cost to make a CD? </b></span></font></p><p>It may surprise you how much money it takes to make a quality recording. Even on the budget end it can cost 20 - 30 thousand! Big names spend 200 - 300 thousand! </p><p>I'm self-producing this one. That means I'm managing all the moving parts myself (like a contractor) and recording most of it in my home studio. This will keep the budget lower. However, studio musicians work hard and need to be paid, and once the recording is finished the final steps of mixing, mastering, and manufacturing are costly. </p><p>I'm raising money primarily for these final steps. </p><p>-What is mixing? Good question! Imagine all the recorded audio (vocals, guitars, drums) as basic ingredients from the grocery store. Next you take the ingredients to an accomplished Chef and he skillfully combines them just right so that they sound like the final song you hear on your CDs. Mixing costs around $500 - $1000 per song. (So 12 songs...)</p><p>-What is mastering? Good question!

How the music moved you? Or how the lyrics felt like they were speaking right to your heart giving you language to understand your life that you didn't have before? Has a song ever whispered to you some word that kept you going in sorrow? That's why I became a songwriter 15 years ago. It's why I picked up a guitar more than 20 years ago. Life is beautiful, life can be so full of sorrow. Those times when a song rises up in the middle of joy or pain to help us understand who we are and what life is really about are a great gift. Will you help me make my next album? What does it cost to make a CD? It may surprise you how much money it takes to make a quality recording. Even on the budget end it can cost 20 - 30 thousand! Big names spend 200 - 300 thousand! I'm self-producing this one. That means I'm managing all the moving parts myself (like a contractor) and recording most of it in my home studio. This will keep the budget lower. However, studio musicians work hard and need to be paid, and once the recording is finished the final steps of mixing, mastering, and manufacturing are costly. I'm raising money primarily for these final steps. -What is mixing? Good question! Imagine all the recorded audio (vocals, guitars, drums) as basic ingredients from the grocery store. Next you take the ingredients to an accomplished Chef and he skillfully combines them just right so that they sound like the final song you hear on your CDs. Mixing costs around $500 - $1000 per song. (So 12 songs...)-What is mastering? Good question! Once the musical ingredients are mixed perfectly they are handed over to another chef who's specialty is setting the oven at the perfect temperature and he bakes the cake so that it comes out just right. A mastering engineer takes all the songs and perfects the overall sound till its delicious. :) Mastering costs about $1000. - Manufacturing costs about $1500 - $2000.  A lot goes into making a CD!  As an individual it's a lot to tackle financially.

It’s THE GOAL ! We are signed at Melodic Revolution Records label, our album is finished, Ed Unitsky created stunning artworks for it, great and famous musicians believe in our music and took part in this record - the only MEGADREAM for us now - to release beautiful CD with lush packaging that you will like with no doubt!</p>
<p>We (and personally me, Alex Kulak) are not simply “brave” here, in the End Of the World (as you maybe think about Tynda, Sybir, Russia). BUT we love to create powerful progmetal music in our own special style also mixing classics’ of the genres’ influence, from Dream Theater, Megadeth, and Yes, to Russian folklore and even “Queen” (thanks to our amazing singer Yann!). We are proud to present our 7th studio album, and the 1st Azazello’s album on English, called MEGADREAM. It based on a mystic/Sci-Fi story that was written by our friend, and Ed Unitsky’s artworks to the album show you the way!</p>
<p><strong>Megadream: more than Guests!</strong></p>
<h5>We are happy that Kerry ‘Kompost’ Chicoine  (ex-Marc Hollow, now - Heliopolis), Bill Berends (Masternind, solo) and Michael Ogorodov (many projects including Pierre Moerlen’s Gong) believe in our music and you can’t miss their brilliant parts in several tracks at the album! This collaboration is really MEGADREAM for us. We are also speechless reading this comment from Kerry ‘Kompost’ Chicoine: “I was asked to contribute some bass for a great band called AzaZello based out of Tynda, Russia; definitely the longest-distance collaboration I've done yet. Azazello's music runs the gamut from math-y Dream Theater-esque progressive metal and heavy rock to Russian folk and melodic jazz. Highly entertaining stuff! Huge thanks to Alexandr Kulak for reaching out to me, I had a blast doing this and I am very happy to be in such great musical company”. Just… THANKS!</h5>

<h3>Megadream CD : what we need</h3>
<p>This is what we need with your more than kind help: CD manufacturing! Here you can see many ways HOW TO MAKE IT REAL – with something pleasant for you ;)  And there is only 60 days to raise the sum!</p>
<p>Our minimum fund-raising goal is 3 800 $ that has to cover</p>
<p>-          CD manufacturing (we want to surprise you with not usual and VERY nice packaging!).</p>
<p>-          Indiegogo’s fees</p>
<p>-          Bank charges and postage for pledges</p>
<p>And any extra capital raised beyond this campaign goal would go for  extra-‘lush’ packaging. Anyway - we guarantee that you will be pleased by this release and all the merchandise. <strong>Thank you for your support from all our band !!!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Megadream: sweet memory…</strong></p>
<p>This album is very special and important for all of us. Our dearest friend and Azazello’s drummer Vladimir Demakov has passed away in a tragic  car incident 12.10.11 just after demos’ recording for the album. We decided to keep all of his parts at this album – you can hear them and judge how talented our young friend was… Megadream album is dedicated to his sweet memory.</p>

<p>The Belwop Project has been working for over 2 years to purchase a new home for the Belwop Children's Home in Nyeri, Kenya for the abused, neglected, and orphaned children there.</p>
<p>Right now, the home can house no more than 20 children, and the new home that is within their grasp can house 100 children!  </p>
<p>Over the course of 2 years, friends, colleages, college students, and others have donated, and Cultivate Wines (<a href=""http://www.cultivate.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.cultivate.com</a>) had a voting session, with the grand prize of $50,000 going to Belwop to purchase this new home! </p>
<p>And this is the final stride - Belwop Project needs $30,000 more to completely finish purchasing the home!</p>
<p>Here's the goal: </p>
<p>1000 People + $30 Each = $30,000</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What We Are Doing:</strong></p>
<p>Isaac Gill and myself (Stephen Stonestreet) are heading on tour screening Belwop's 'Hope Has A Home' Documentary, playing music, spreading the word about Belwop and the needs of the orphans in Kenya, and raising support to purchase a new home for orphans. </p>
<p>Below are the cities we will be touring too: </p>
<p>- Norfolk, VA</p>
<p>- Charlottesville, VA</p>
<p>- Lynchburg, VA</p>
<p>- Charleston, WV</p>
<p>- and possible others...</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Through this tour, we hope to bring hundreds of more people around the Belwop Movement and raise a substantial amount towards the needed $30k, our hope is $4,000! </p>
<p>We hope to inspire a movement of individuals on the East Coast to begin supporting Belwop with their voice, fingers (social media), and their finances! If the people who come to these events get excited (which they will!), then we'll not only have a group of people support Belwop, but their communities around them who will know about it as a result! </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What do we need? </strong></p>
<p>Here is what we need (in bullet point form): </p>
<p> </p>
<p>- A VEHICLE: $200</p>
<p>- Gas for tour: $175</p>
<p>- Food for our bellies: $100</p>
<p>- $25 for printing posters for the event(s). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>All money we receive here on IndieGoGo ABOVE our goal will go directly to help finish purchasing the home! And if we find a car to drive, and don't have to rent one, then the $200 designated for that purpose will be directly placed in the plate to finish purchasing the home in Kenya!</p>

<p>We are a group of friends that decided to turn our jam sessions into a band and start trying to make a name for ourselves. We long to reach people with the music we make and the love that we show. We enjoy writing about life, pain, God and love. We came up with the name, Anchor North. The video explains a little bit more about the name and what it means to us. We all decided that we wanted to make this band something serious and start recording and playing as many shows as we could. So basically as a young group, we need as much support as we can in order to do what we hope to do these next few months.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We need about $3,000 to record this album and pay for traveling expenses on our summer tour. We are planning on recording this album with our friend, Wes Arvin. We cannot express how excited and anxious we are to start moving forward. Right now we are planning on touring this summer with our good friend, Kevin Rodriguez of TROTB. Hopefully we will be making a stop in a town near you!</p>
<p>We have done our best to set up some fun rewards for you to back our campaign. We can't wait to see what God has in store for us and our music career and we hope you will join us as we start this long journey!</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>We are so grateful for the people God has placed in our lives and the blessings he has given us and we realize that without you we cannot do any of this. So the impact you are making on our lives is far bigger than you can see right now, but is sure to grow this year. By supporting our campaign and helping us fund this album and tour you are sending us forward so far and giving us the opportunity to show our music to the world and spread hope and love to those in need.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>We know that some of you simply cannot give money and thats okay. We need just as much help promoting this on every single social media you have an account with! Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Instagram, ANYTHING! WE NEED YOUR HELP! You can do this easily by either copying this URL into another site or by using the Indie GoGo share tools.</p></div>","Short Summary

<p>Hello everyone its Mike Larry Draw here and I am ready to share. I spent the pass year writing the songs and producing instrumentals for this album, and more recently mixing and mastering with the equipment that I have.  Comprised of progressive arrangements, and various tempo changes by yours truly, I locked myself in a room, I made what I believe, and what others have told me, to be a great album that will make you pee your fucking pants for joy. It sounds like nothing I’ve ever heard, and I made it, Lol, Especially for its genre. This album has some great sounds, ORGANS, SYNTHESIZERS, GUITAR, HEAVY DRUMS and more PS “NO SAMPLES”. I hope to be touring this project across the globe this year. As I travel I will be working on some KILLER music videos,</p>
<p>DIRECTED BY ME!!!!!!!!!! Plus working on some art pieces I can share with everyone.</p>
<p>Im almost to the finish line, I am very close to having my creative freedom, and being a full time artist for the fans. BUT this same freedom has its drawbacks- since I don’t have the financial muscle and backing of a large record label, recording each album sets me back to cash zero. And once I release each album, there is no funding to produce CDs or vinyl, to promote the album, and NEVER any money left to equip, rehearse, and take a show on the road. Tour support costs way more than most people realize. And that's a cycle most independent musicians now struggle to break.</p>
<p>With your help I will take this new album and my other music out on the road in 2013 and play everywhere I can.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>This is my chance. Donate and help me get this request to as many people as you can- and I'll use the money we raise together to manufacture, Promote, and go on tour. IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>With enough money raised I can share my art with the world weather if its on a poster, sticker, button, patch or a piece of clothing. I've spent many hours of the day designing for you all carefully, and I'm pleased to offer a variety of options that I personally would love to own. I will keep the quality as high as I can. You can find the full descriptions in the pledges on the right. </p>

<li>My name is Aaron Cloutier.  I'm a musician, songwriter and guitar/vocal instructor at the School of Rock in Chatham, New Jersey<br/>
</li>
<li>I'm raising $1000.00 for a retainer for my attorney to contact a music licensing company as we have reason to believe there is a potential breach of contract between they and myself.  My song ""I of the Obscene"" is currently a Nickelodeon commercial and I have received zero royalties to date.<br/>

<li>Your donation will help cover the legal fees necessary for my attorney to contact this company directly and investigate why nickelodeon has my song and why I haven't received royalties for the use of my song as is part of the contract I have with said company.  Any extra funds after legal costs will go towards medical bills due to a fractured arm I received on May 4 from being dragged a block by a NYC taxi cab.<br/>
</li>
</ul><br/>""Hello all I apologize in advance<span> for how lengthy a post it will be but if you can take the time to read, I would appreciate it greatly...........here it goes.<br/><br/>
 My song ""I of the Obscene"" is currently being used in a Nickelodeon 
commercial. Attached is a video taken by a fan of his own TV screen as 
the commercial is being aired. (There are other's floating around on 
Youtube if you feel like viewing them as well)<br/><br/><a href=""http://youtu.be/T2uc5UZ9hR4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://youtu.be/T2uc5UZ9hR4</a><br/><br/>
 After speaking to two different attorneys, it looks like I am facing a 
possible breach of contract between myself and a company in NYC (which 
will remain nameless until confirmed) I licensed my music through.<br/><br/>
 In 2012, An agreement was signed between myself and this company 
stating that there was to be an even 50/50 split of any revenue 
generated from the use of my music licensed out to any company. To this 
date, I have received zero royalties for the use of my song in the 
commercial and to my knowledge, the commercial began airing in October 
of 2013 and is still in rotation. So as it stands until we know more, it
 appears this company (who is affiliated with nickelodeon by the way) 
gave my song to Nickelodeon to be used in their commercial and I have 
not yet been compensated as part of our signed agreement. In other 
words, it looks like this company breached our contract.<br/><br/> To 
confirm this, my attorney will be contacting this company to find out 
more. However, I'm required to pay a $1000.00 retainer fee to cover 
legal expenses and will need to come up with half of the money by Friday
 June 6th to get the ball rolling. Unfortunately what with normal 
everyday living expenses/loans and my recent medical bills due to the 
accident involving me getting dragged down a block by a New York City 
Taxi driver on May 4th, ( Yes.  True story unfortunately) I don't have the money to cover a $1000.00 retainer.  This a very humbling position for 
me to be in.  I've always considered myself super independent and I 
really hate having to ask anyone for money but what with the time frame 
and the current circumstances, I really feel that I don't have any 
choice.  As a way of saying thank you for your donation.  I will be offering a list of services pertaining to my work as a professional musician.  I have worked with numerous musician's/artists from Latin Metal band Ill Nino, to renowned actor Christopher Lee and can only promise I'll give 100% to whatever product or service you decide to donate to.    Any support will be 
immensely appreciated and compensated for. Thank you so much for reading
 and please spread the word to those you know.<br/><br/> Thank you all again.<br/><br/> Aaron.</span><br/><p></p><p></p><br/></div>","My name is Aaron Cloutier.  I'm a musician, songwriter and guitar/vocal instructor at the School of Rock in Chatham, New Jersey

No problem. Just pay for the shipping on our site.

We want to give you the most awesome music experience that you can handle, which is why were making a record. Do you like feminism? Punk? Badass-sery? Satan? Do you want to see a woman and a trans guy succeed in music who don't give any fucks about societal norms or oppressive gender roles? Then you should donate to help us record our next album! As the stereotype goes, we are incredibly broke artists/musicians. We hate selling our shit because we hate capitalism, but unfortunately in this capitalistic, patriarchal society we gotta do what we gotta do to make cool stuff.

We want to give you the most awesome music experience that you can handle, which is why were making a record. Do you like feminism? Punk? Badass-sery? Satan? Do you want to see a woman and a trans guy succeed in music who don't give any fucks about societal norms or oppressive gender roles? Then you should donate to help us record our next album! As the stereotype goes, we are incredibly broke artists/musicians.

<h3><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Who the Heck Is ""Johnny Full-Time"" and What's Full-Time Blues Radio?</span></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>I, ""Johnny Full-Time"" John Luttrell, started broadcasting Full-Time Blues Radio in June of 2008. The first episode signed on the air at 91.5-FM WUEV, at the very same hour that the nearby W.C. Handy Blues and Barbecue Festival kicked off their 2008 edition of the event. The radio station is owned by the University of Evansville, and is the only station in my part of the country that plays Blues music on the air. Being both a professional broadcaster and a Blues fanatic, I approached the management about volunteering, and the relationship has only grown since then.<br/><br/>I have since shaped Full-Time Blues Radio into ""The Home for New and Independent Blues Music,"" providing a launching pad for virtually unknown Blues performers to reach potential fans. I feature a high turnover of new music from both independent acts and established performers. In addition, I have artists and bands on the show through in-studio performances and telephone interviews. I also keep folks in my area up to date on live Blues concerts to get out and support, and I feature music that literally arrived to me in the past week during a segment called ""Johnny's Mailbox.""<br/><br/>I'm so passionate about this original American art form, and I want to not only see Blues music survive, but thrive! Nearly all musical forms from the United States have grown out of or borrowed from the Blues traditions, and there are so many people out there who share my passion that are struggling to reach an audience because they have nowhere to get their music played. I love the all-time greats of the Blues, but you can hear them on any Blues radio show or online stream. The charge I've given myself is to put the spotlight on the lesser knowns of the world of Blues.<br/><br/>I became a victim of the economy in 2009, when my full-time radio job was eliminated. I pulled together the money to start my website, <a href=""http://www.fulltimeblues.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.fulltimeblues.com</a> in an effort to sieze the opportunity at making my dream a reality. In the past 18 months, I've been on a high wire without a net, and there have been a few spills, but more importantly, some amazing thrills. I was invited to emcee that very same W.C. Handy Blues and Barbecue Festival in 2010, and recently made my first trip to New Orleans as a featured panelist representing radio at the Cutting Edge Music Business Conference.

<p>I am going to start an internet radio station through my website. Full-Time Blues Radio will no longer simply be a two hour weekly attraction on WUEV.

No, the concept is to operate like a real FM radio station online. I've been a professional broadcaster working in radio and television for more than 5 years. I have two degrees in Broadcasting and Telecommunications from two of Indiana's most acclaimed programs. I have a passion for Blues music that is unrivaled by anyone, and a desire to see independent musicians make their dreams come true, while I do the same.<br/><br/>The station will operate via Shoutcast, which is a service by Winamp - a free media player for windows, mac, and linux users. Shoutcast radio is also available as a free app for iPhone and Android mobile devices, allowing folks to listen to stations on the go. This allows Full-Time Blues Radio to reach literally millions of potential listeners globally, providing a place where Blues music fans can hear artists they won't be exposed to anywhere else. I've created a programming schedule, come up with advertising packages, built an extensive network of record labels, radio reps, managers, an independent artists and bands. Perhaps most importantly, I also have an ever-expanding library of music.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><font size=""4""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""> <font size=""3"">  </font></span><font size=""3"">I am the artist known as L. Young. I have over 18 years experience in the music industry as an artist, songwriter, and producer. I've worked with <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Stevie Wonder, Nicole Scherzinger, R. Kelly, &amp; KeKe Wyatt </span>to name a few. I've released 3 albums to date (04's 'They Just Don't Know"", 07's ""The 12th Letter"", and 2011's ""Love Is A Verb). I also have songs playing in various TV and Films such as <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">VH1's Basketball Wives: Miami, USA Network's Burn Notice, &amp; BET's The Game</span>. I'm surrounded by honest, hardworking industry professionals who, like myself, are frustrated with the lack of options available to the so-called ""Urban"" music listener. We think its important to have variety not only on the internet, but in mainstream music mediums as well. I, L. Young, with your help, pledge to bring balance back to the Urban music universe.</font></font><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><font size=""4"">   <font size=""3"">You may think, ""why should I contribute to you when I have my own dreams and bills to go along with it?"" This is an opportunity for us to show the power of unity, and that a little done by many can mean a lot. Rappers have been doing this for years. Their fans get behind them and create a buzz so strong on youtube, twitter, &amp; facebook that radio and tv is forced to recognize them. We would not know who <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">50 Cent</span> or even <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Drake</span> is today had they not used their own resources to put out mixtapes and the fans who liked it spread the word. Can this not be done in R&amp;B? Allow me to be the vessel in which YOU demonstrate to the industry professionals that you will not be dictated to as to what is ""hot"" and what's not. Bring real R&amp;B back to today and let's stop reminiscing over the 90's when songs told stories and were built around strong melodies. WE CAN HAVE IT NOW. Lets say that we demand quality music again. And we WILL support it! If the industry sees that, it won't be so hard for the next generation of artist to aspire to use real instruments in their songs. Help them not to feel pressured to get the hottest rapper on their song. Make it harder for them to be shut out for aspiring to emulate Stevie Wonder as opposed to sounding just like their own contemporaries. If we can get 1 mainstream R&amp;B artist to ""blow up"" totally off the support of the people and not some major label publicity and marketing campaign, the impact would be huge. It would open the Urban market up to a slew of artists who, up to this point, have been completely shut out.</font></font><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><font size=""3"">   </font><font size=""3"">Here's the deal. I need your help in completing my music video and online campaign for the new single. I've enlisted the help of a talented up &amp; coming video director named Delvon Simmons to shoot my new single ""Hurt You."" I've NEVER had any financial help in recording or promoting any of my 3 albums and I'm out of resources (I'm broke!!!). I believe with all my heart that this is the song that will not only do wonders for my career and name recognition, but also start the shift back to ""real R&amp;B. I need your contributions to help with the filming/editing, social networking and blog campaign that will need to follow as soon as the video/song is released. We will also need a constant presence on Youtube, Facebook, twitter, emails and phones daily for 60 days or more. The staff to do that will cost. Money will also be needed to travel to smaller markets outside L.A. to do D.J. pools, shows, giveaways, and appearances. Money will also be needed to design &amp; press up DVD's, CD's, press kits, and merchandise like t-shirts for these trips. Yes, its possible that $7500 will not be enough to accomplish all the things I need, but its a realistic start. As money comes in, I will re-invest in myself. If you are one of the many who have ever attended one of my shows and said, ""why are you not world famous?"" Or after going to my site and listening to my songs have said, ""why isn't this on the radio?"" Well here's our chance to fix that and in the process create a path and business model in which up &amp; coming artists can do the same. <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">I CAN'T DO THIS ALONE!</span> STRENGTH IN NUMBERS, and watch our numbers (sales, hits, views, downloads) be our strength.</font><br/></p>

   I am the artist known as L. Young. I have over 18 years experience in the music industry as an artist, songwriter, and producer. I've worked with Stevie Wonder, Nicole Scherzinger, R. Kelly, & KeKe Wyatt to name a few. I've released 3 albums to date (04's 'They Just Don't Know"", 07's ""The 12th Letter"", and 2011's ""Love Is A Verb). I also have songs playing in various TV and Films such as VH1's Basketball Wives: Miami, USA Network's Burn Notice, & BET's The Game. I'm surrounded by honest, hardworking industry professionals who, like myself, are frustrated with the lack of options available to the so-called ""Urban"" music listener. We think its important to have variety not only on the internet, but in mainstream music mediums as well. I, L. Young, with your help, pledge to bring balance back to the Urban music universe.


The Impact
   You may think, ""why should I contribute to you when I have my own dreams and bills to go along with it?"" This is an opportunity for us to show the power of unity, and that a little done by many can mean a lot. Rappers have been doing this for years. Their fans get behind them and create a buzz so strong on youtube, twitter, & facebook that radio and tv is forced to recognize them. We would not know who 50 Cent or even Drake is today had they not used their own resources to put out mixtapes and the fans who liked it spread the word. Can this not be done in R&B? Allow me to be the vessel in which YOU demonstrate to the industry professionals that you will not be dictated to as to what is ""hot"" and what's not. Bring real R&B back to today and let's stop reminiscing over the 90's when songs told stories and were built around strong melodies. WE CAN HAVE IT NOW. Lets say that we demand quality music again. And we WILL support it! If the industry sees that, it won't be so hard for the next generation of artist to aspire to use real instruments in their songs. Help them not to feel pressured to get the hottest rapper on their song. Make it harder for them to be shut out for aspiring to emulate Stevie Wonder as opposed to sounding just like their own contemporaries. If we can get 1 mainstream R&B artist to ""blow up"" totally off the support of the people and not some major label publicity and marketing campaign, the impact would be huge. It would open the Urban market up to a slew of artists who, up to this point, have been completely shut out.


What We Need & What You Get
   Here's the deal. I need your help in completing my music video and online campaign for the new single. I've enlisted the help of a talented up & coming video director named Delvon Simmons to shoot my new single ""Hurt You."" I've NEVER had any financial help in recording or promoting any of my 3 albums and I'm out of resources (I'm broke!!!). I believe with all my heart that this is the song that will not only do wonders for my career and name recognition, but also start the shift back to ""real R&B. I need your contributions to help with the filming/editing, social networking and blog campaign that will need to follow as soon as the video/song is released. We will also need a constant presence on Youtube, Facebook, twitter, emails and phones daily for 60 days or more. The staff to do that will cost. Money will also be needed to travel to smaller markets outside L.A. to do D.J. pools, shows, giveaways, and appearances. Money will also be needed to design & press up DVD's, CD's, press kits, and merchandise like t-shirts for these trips. Yes, its possible that $7500 will not be enough to accomplish all the things I need, but its a realistic start. As money comes in, I will re-invest in myself. If you are one of the many who have ever attended one of my shows and said, ""why are you not world famous?"" Or after going to my site and listening to my songs have said, ""why isn't this on the radio?"" Well here's our chance to fix that and in the process create a path and business model in which up & coming artists can do the same. I CAN'T DO THIS ALONE! STRENGTH IN NUMBERS, and watch our numbers (sales, hits, views, downloads) be our strength.


Other Ways You Can Help
   There are other things you can do if you don't have a financial contribution to make. You can repost, resend, redistribute the link to this campaign to everyone on your Facebook, twitter, & email list. Send people by my website or Facebook/twitter page. Attend my shows. Call local live music venues in your area and ask them to book me. Call the radio stations and ask them why are they not playing my music. Every mention of my name and music helps tremendously.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</li>
<li>Camps make sure that all children are treated fairly. Every child starts without the psychological baggage they

<li>Camps offer kids a chance to feel that they belong.</li>
<li>Camps give kids both cultural roots and the chance to understand others who have cultures very different than their own.</li>
<li>Camps environments form new relationships, not just with peers, but with trusted adults other 
than parents. Children learn to negotiate on their own with an adult for what they need.</li>
</ul><p>But then what's so important about MUSIC?</p><ul>
<li>Musical training helps develop brain areas involved in language and reasoning.</li>
<li>There is a causal link between music 
and spatial intelligence (the ability to perceive the world accurately

<li>Students of the arts learn to think 
creatively and to solve problems by imagining various solutions,

<li>Studies show that students who 
study the arts are more successful on standardized tests such as the

<li>In music, a mistake is a mistake; the

of sustained effort to achieve excellence and the concrete rewards of 
hard work.<br/>

Camps environments form new relationships, not just with peers, but with trusted adults other

But then what's so important about MUSIC?
Musical training helps develop brain areas involved in language and reasoning.
There is a causal link between music 
and spatial intelligence (the ability to perceive the world accurately 
and to form mental pictures of things).
Students of the arts learn to think 
creatively and to solve problems by imagining various solutions, 
rejecting outdated rules and assumptions. Questions about the arts do 
not have only one right answer.
Studies show that students who 
study the arts are more successful on standardized tests such as the

Students of music learn craftsmanship as 
they study how details are put together painstakingly and what 
constitutes good, as opposed to mediocre, work.

</div><div>I have already developed a prototype that generates type annotations for a subset of Clojure programs. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">We plan to release this prototype in a future core.typed release (<a href=""https://github.com/typedclojure/core.typed/pull/101"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">preview branch</a>). The prototype infers function types, recursive map types, immutable collections, mutable atoms, and other base types.</span>
</div><div>From here, we plan to test our prototype against a suite of popular Clojure libraries. We will compile, evaluate, and release these results, then iterate on our prototype.</div><div>There are several dimensions to improve the generated types, including:</div><div><ul>
<li>
<i style=""background-color: initial;"">correctly chosen recursive types:</i><span style=""background-color: initial;""> generated nested types are squashed into recursive types based on a configurable algorithm. The correct choice will be based on real-world trials.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<i style=""background-color: initial;"">well named aliases:</i><span style=""background-color: initial;""> type aliases are used to share commonly occurring types between functions. Choosing good names for these aliases helps readability.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<i>suitability for type checking:</i> type annotations are used as fuel for type checking Clojure code. If a generated annotation successfully checks the definition and most usages of a function, then it's probably a good annotation.</li>

We already write tests to specify our functions, what if we could also use them to generate type annotations?To type check untyped code, you must write type annotations. Unfortunately, they are very annoying to write! When CircleCI abandoned Typed Clojure, they cited the annotation burden as a top reason for doing so. Even though they loved the key ideas underlying the type system, annotations were just too much work.
This is why automatic annotations are so badly needed: with this tool, you can get the benefits of a type system, without the tedium of writing annotations manually.
How to use itTo generate annotations for your namespace, simply:
add core.typed metadata to your namespace,

run your unit tests for the namespace,

run clojure.core.typed/runtime-infer in the current namespace.
Voila! Here's what our prototype produces.The BenefitsAnnotations help us do more than just type check untyped code.Other benefits include:

documenting code: We can answer questions like ""Given the current inputs/outputs, what kind of function have we written?"". We can ask questions like this at any time in development.

runtime checking: Annotations can also be enforced at runtime, using infrastructure developed for Gradual Typing, my previous campaign.

generative tests: We could even use the automatic annotation infrastructure to generate clojure.spec generative tests!

The Plan
I have already developed a prototype that generates type annotations for a subset of Clojure programs. We plan to release this prototype in a future core.typed release (preview branch). The prototype infers function types, recursive map types, immutable collections, mutable atoms, and other base types.
From here, we plan to test our prototype against a suite of popular Clojure libraries. We will compile, evaluate, and release these results, then iterate on our prototype.There are several dimensions to improve the generated types, including:

correctly chosen recursive types: generated nested types are squashed into recursive types based on a configurable algorithm. The correct choice will be based on real-world trials.


well named aliases: type aliases are used to share commonly occurring types between functions. Choosing good names for these aliases helps readability.


suitability for type checking: type annotations are used as fuel for type checking Clojure code. If a generated annotation successfully checks the definition and most usages of a function, then it's probably a good annotation.

We are aiming to submit an ICFP paper (due ~February).
The FeedbackI will keep everyone posted on our progress via my Twitter and my blog. Major releases will be announced on the core.typed mailing list. Our paper drafts will also be made publicly available.Why I need your help
If you are excited about this project and want to help it succeed, funding this campaign is the best way to support me. This campaign will help me to:



attend industrial conferences like Strangeloop, Clojure/conj, Clojure West, and Curry On,

connect with the Clojure community via local meetups, and
sustain my PhD program by staying out of debt.

Funds donated from the programming community have been vital in my progress with Typed Clojure.

Your support is greatly appreciated, and I hope you're just as excited as I am about the future of Typed Clojure!

<p>""Skins"" is the landing pad. Scheduled for a mid-November release, it's a nine-track album showcasing the most important songs from the last several years of my life.

<p>These songs are deeply personal. They're about people I've loved (or thought I loved) and ways my heart has been broken. They're messy life stories I've whittled down in an attempt to make concise and built up in an attempt to make artful. They're about the big things that I notice in small moments. They're about the intense emotions we experience beneath the tough skin that we all wear to protect ourselves. </p>

Our team consists of a director (Jake Ivany) and an art director and cinematographer (Alex Garnett), along with myself in a duel position of production manager and producer. Our campaign is based around a Halifax local band known as ""The Regal Beagle Band"". The band has recently released their debut album and are looking to work with us in creating their first music video for the album. Being part of a project within our community while supporting local music and talent has always been important to us as filmmakers. Any support from contributors would be beyond amazing and greatly appreciated as it shows us you believe in what we can achieve. Any donation would greatly benefit us no matter what the amount, and if you are unable to contribute I would like to thank you for taking the time to read about our project.

<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The video for ""Waiting on a Sign"" will consist of a mixture of interior and exterior locations where two characters will interact. It will also be filmed in studio at the NSCC Waterfront Campus where a team of us will be building and dressing full sets. Filming will take place in March 2015, and will likely require numerous shoot days. For a goal for this project, we aimed for $600. Funding will be used for construction cost, set dressing cost, sound, lighting and camera equipment, locations, craft, and any other surprise cost that may arise. Receiving funding for this project would not only mean everything to the band, but also to the filmmakers behind the video. The campaign will begin January 14<sup>th</sup>, 2015 and run for roughly a month depending on progress and time constraints. Rewards will be sent out roughly a month after the completion of the video (timeframe depends on the reward). Rewards come in vast and different forms including personalized t-shirts, signed posters, a dinner prepared for you by the band, and a free show anywhere in NS at the venue of your choice for you and your friends. If we don't end up reaching our goal, funds received will still be used towards the video and be allocated into appropriate departments. Again I'd like to thank you for taking the time to read about our project, and any little bit helps us get closer to our goal.</p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Making a contribution to this project would be great for not only the band but also for the community. The Regal Beagle Band has racked up multiple East Coast tours, a handful of Ontario trips, and a vast amount in Nova Scotia. With over 160 live performances, they have shared the stage with such critically acclaimed acts as The Stanfields, The Town Heroes, and Ben Caplan, as well as Halifax favourites The Stogies, Alert the Medic, Jessie Brown and Floodland. It would be great to have this band get noticed and take off. This is my first Indiegogo campaign but I have numerous experiences with budgeting short films, and other project types. I look forward to working with Indiegogo and gaining experience and learning from this project.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div> <p> </p>
<p></p>
</div><h3><span>Risks &amp; Challenges</span></h3><p>For this video numerous locations will have to be acquired, both interior and exterior. Getting locations can always be challenging depending on availability, cost, and space. Having some money put off to the side as an honorarium often helps. Another way which helps from past experiences is to offer something, whether it be marketing or promoting the location to others, to doing favours or a free show. I feel acquiring these locations won't be a challenge that we can't overcome with the knowledge and perspective of the students at NSCC as we are taught how to acquire locations and how to treat the space respectfully.</p><p>Funding of course is another issue, that at this time is unpredictable. As Producer I am weighing in different possibilities and outcomes of this campaign so I can be prepared either way. Working will a none specific budget has been different, yet challenging in a good way. Allowing me to polish up my skill set. At NSCC we are taught and giving resources on how to plan accordingly to any issues that may arise.</p><p><br/></p><h3><span>Other Ways You Can Help</span></h3><p>We understand that everyone can't help, and not everyone has extra money to donate to a project they can relate and care about. That is perfectly okay, we still appreciate you taking the time out of your day to read about our project. What we're asking of you is to please share on your social media, comment, or post what you like about our cause. Any little bit of  awareness will help our project get noticed and is appreciated.</p><div><p></p></div></div>","Short Summary My name is Patrick Kervin, I am currently in my final semester of the Screen Arts program at Nova Scotia Community College.

The Impact
Making a contribution to this project would be great for not only the band but also for the community. The Regal Beagle Band has racked up multiple East Coast tours, a handful of Ontario trips, and a vast amount in Nova Scotia. With over 160 live performances, they have shared the stage with such critically acclaimed acts as The Stanfields, The Town Heroes, and Ben Caplan, as well as Halifax favourites The Stogies, Alert the Medic, Jessie Brown and Floodland. It would be great to have this band get noticed and take off. This is my first Indiegogo campaign but I have numerous experiences with budgeting short films, and other project types. I look forward to working with Indiegogo and gaining experience and learning from this project.


  

Risks & ChallengesFor this video numerous locations will have to be acquired, both interior and exterior. Getting locations can always be challenging depending on availability, cost, and space. Having some money put off to the side as an honorarium often helps. Another way which helps from past experiences is to offer something, whether it be marketing or promoting the location to others, to doing favours or a free show. I feel acquiring these locations won't be a challenge that we can't overcome with the knowledge and perspective of the students at NSCC as we are taught how to acquire locations and how to treat the space respectfully.Funding of course is another issue, that at this time is unpredictable. As Producer I am weighing in different possibilities and outcomes of this campaign so I can be prepared either way. Working will a none specific budget has been different, yet challenging in a good way. Allowing me to polish up my skill set. At NSCC we are taught and giving resources on how to plan accordingly to any issues that may arise.Other Ways You Can HelpWe understand that everyone can't help, and not everyone has extra money to donate to a project they can relate and care about. That is perfectly okay, we still appreciate you taking the time out of your day to read about our project. What we're asking of you is to please share on your social media, comment, or post what you like about our cause. Any little bit of  awareness will help our project get noticed and is appreciated.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>I grew up in the swamps of Massachusetts, wandering the woods, a free agent, running from cops and neighbors with frogs and lady slippers (<em>Cypripedium calceolus</em>) in my hands. </h2>
<p>Despite the known existence of classical trained musicians in my family, I didn’t pick up the guitar until age 15.  I attended Marlboro College in Vermont as a creative writing major, but didn’t take well to structure--only to my guitar and songwriting. I left college after a year, working on various farms and eventually ended up on small island called Naushon off the coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. </p>
<p>On Naushon I met world renowned ethnomusicologist <a href=""http://www.folklife.si.edu/archives_resources/about.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ralph Rinzler</a>, who discovered Doc Watson and started Folkways Records.  Ralph asked me to play a song for him, and then took it upon himself to give me a lesson or two.  Later, he hired me to drive his private collection of priceless Blues cylinders from DC to Ojai, California.  Along the way I went through New Mexico and was completely taken by its strange beauty. </p>
<p><strong>EAST OR WEST</strong></p>
<p>Soon after, while working on a hay wagon on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naushon_Island"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Naushon"">Naushon</a> I fell into one of Einstein’s “wormholes” and ended up in Santa Cruz, California studying sustainable agriculture, permaculture, horticulture and organic gardening.  I started an organic farm in Sebastopol in 1994.  After a year or so, I found myself lured back to New Mexico. </p>
<p>In December of 1999, after five years in Santa Fe, I moved back to Massachusetts to dedicate my life to music and songwriting.  After five years in Boston, landing on a European label and winning Boston’s Best Male Vocalist Award, I decided to leave it all on a good note and returned to New Mexico.  Back in the <a href=""http://palaceofthegovernors.org/exhibits/Portraits/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Land of Enchantment"">Land of Enchantment</a> I continued this musical dream, along with buying an “off the grid” farm, planting an orchard, getting married, raising two free-range kids, being Mayordomo of the valley, being an arborist and touring Europe every two years. </p>
<p><strong>DEEPER PURPOSE</strong></p>
<p>This dream continues with one of the greatest undiscovered bands of all time, the Mighty Salt Licks.  I have been told by fans that we “saved their lives”, “helped them heal”, “performed the best show they have ever seen in their life” and one fan even went as far as to say “Boris, if you make me cry one more time, I’m gonna have to kick your ass”.  My music draws from simple everyday life and its strange cast of players; and compels and asks to find a deeper purpose in it all. </p>

<p><strong>THE STUDIO AND THE SONGS</strong></p>
</div>
<p>I arranged in October 2011 to go back into the studio and try to knock out some new songs the band and I had been kicking around since the Spring.  We had tested the new songs out at the Moab Folk Festival, in <a href=""http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.paintinghere.org/UploadPic/Vincent%2520van%2520Gogh/big/Flower%2520Beds%2520in%2520Holland.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.paintinghere.org/painting/flower_beds_in_holland-4316.html&amp;h=706&amp;w=952&amp;sz=156&amp;tbnid=qmJTggpaSy-5lM:&amp;tbnh=100&amp;tbnw=135&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dholland%2Bvan%2Bgogh%26tbm%3Disch%26tbo%3Du&amp;zoom=1&amp;q=holland+van+gogh&amp;usg=__CuUDlMq-UukcKc77IMjw2galswo=&amp;docid=WMgKg1bkZx9isM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FFxQUcGTCuO_0gHKjoC4BQ&amp;ved=0CHgQ9QEwBw&amp;dur=5547"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Holland"">Holland</a>, and at various New Mexican venues and had settled on some long-tried and tested arrangements. From the beginning of Fall 2011 I had been completely overcome by the seasons tone, its light and intensity. It really struck me in a way that I had not felt in a while or maybe ever. </p>
<p>My wife and I had been struggling for years to raise our kids in a remote, off the grid valley and really not making ends meet with her schoolteacher salary and my musician’s chump change.  It was all really coming to a head and the Fall just brought it there quickly in a raving yellow sea of aspens. </p>
<p><strong>MIGHT CRASH TAKES SHAPE</strong></p>
<p>One of the main songs to be recorded that weekend was a song entitled “Might Crash”.  It was a song that began as a joke, to bring some lightness to the dark mood of the times.  I was feeling regretful and worthless and when I saw one of our dogs dining on a diaper in the melting snow, I turned and asked my wife if we had turned into white trash.  How did our ideals morph into this gruesome image?  Babies crying, broke, stuck on the mountain splitting wood in a snowstorm.  Why were we here, what were we doing?  The song became “Might Crash”, the title track of the new album.  A song that in the end, sums up our New Great Depression.</p>
<h2 style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>How do you know when you might crash?</em></h2>
<h2 style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>Is the dog eating diapers on the dying lawn?</em></h2>
<h2 style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>Do your lips not reach her before she leaves?</em></h2>
<h2 style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>Is she wondering where the fun has gone?</em></h2>
<p>Finally, the morning came to meet with the Mighty Salt Licks at the studio.  As I drove down the mountain from Truchas, NM, the aspen groves were on fire, and my heart was on fire.  I was overtaken again, and had to pull over and try to sum up the feeling.  I wrote the song “Flesh and Dream” on the shoulder of the ribbon of death, Highway 76.  I finished the song before I had arrived at Frogville Studios.  I decided to show it to Susan and the band and we recorded it first, hardly knowing it at all. Cautiously we entered “Flesh and Dream” trying to find its groove and depth.  Going into the studio and recording a song that the band has never heard and I have never played on guitar is something I would never do, but somehow it felt right then and we did it and triumphed.  It is also one of the strongest songs on the new album.  The “Might Crash” project has been recorded live from the beginning with the entire band in one big room.  The core tracks of the project were recorded that fall week, in October 2011 by Bill Palmer.  All said and done there have been 20 songs recorded live at John Treadwell's <a href=""http://www.frogvilleplanet.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Frogville"">Frogville </a>with a few guest performers.  It has been a stunning project, one that has mellowed and matured over time like a good whiskey.<strong> </strong>This project would never have made it off the ground without the dynamic engineering powers and generosity of <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Bill-Palmer-Production-Engineering/158932224176630"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Bill Palmer"">Bill Palmer</a>.</p>

<p>At any given show multi-instrumentalist Brett Davis seeks out the perfect tone through one of his handmade perfect amps. He is a scholar of North American music and draws his greatest influence probably from guitarist Robbie Robertson. I have collaborated with him for almost twenty years. His soulful playing was absolutely essential in the making of the analog albums “When We Were Big”, and “Cactusman Versus The Blue Demon”.  Brett is one of a kind and since he is the only member from New Mexico he brings that vibe with him, relaxed and behind the beat. His playing speaks volumes on this new “Might Crash"" project.</p>

She is a truly awesome presence and breaks up the ugly white boy syndrome in the band. Susan can conquer a crowd with her smile and bass thunder and regularly schools the band in true three-part harmony.</p>
<p>Kevin Zoernig aka “Professor Furious” produced ”Cactusman”, and the “Wheel of Life” albums. He is the most gifted musician and teacher I have ever had the privilege to work with. Kevin is daring to the end on keys and with visions and ideas to boot in the studio.</p>
<p>Paul Groetzinger is one the finest drummers in the Southwest. Because he is a fine singer too, his drums follow suit and play to the phrasing of each song accordingy. He studied at the College of Santa Fe under you guessed it, “Professor Furious”.  He has the guts to go out on a limb. He tries new things. He experiments. He feels it and everyone knows it. His approach is fantastically fluid but with a Charlie Watts rock ‘n’ roll appeal.</p>

</div></div>","Welcome to the ""Might Crash"" project.This album traces the epic journey of an off the grid Romantic seeking to solve the conundrum of life on the margins of American society. How do you know when you might crash? Here's your chance to elevate an American artist whose music gets to the core of the struggle between light and darkness, security and insecurity. 
 
I grew up in the swamps of Massachusetts, wandering the woods, a free agent, running from cops and neighbors with frogs and lady slippers (Cypripedium calceolus) in my hands. 
Despite the known existence of classical trained musicians in my family, I didn’t pick up the guitar until age 15.  I attended Marlboro College in Vermont as a creative writing major, but didn’t take well to structure--only to my guitar and songwriting. I left college after a year, working on various farms and eventually ended up on small island called Naushon off the coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. 
On Naushon I met world renowned ethnomusicologist Ralph Rinzler, who discovered Doc Watson and started Folkways Records.  Ralph asked me to play a song for him, and then took it upon himself to give me a lesson or two.  Later, he hired me to drive his private collection of priceless Blues cylinders from DC to Ojai, California.  Along the way I went through New Mexico and was completely taken by its strange beauty. 
EAST OR WEST
Soon after, while working on a hay wagon on Naushon I fell into one of Einstein’s “wormholes” and ended up in Santa Cruz, California studying sustainable agriculture, permaculture, horticulture and organic gardening.  I started an organic farm in Sebastopol in 1994.  After a year or so, I found myself lured back to New Mexico. 
In December of 1999, after five years in Santa Fe, I moved back to Massachusetts to dedicate my life to music and songwriting.  After five years in Boston, landing on a European label and winning Boston’s Best Male Vocalist Award, I decided to leave it all on a good note and returned to New Mexico.  Back in the Land of Enchantment I continued this musical dream, along with buying an “off the grid” farm, planting an orchard, getting married, raising two free-range kids, being Mayordomo of the valley, being an arborist and touring Europe every two years.

<p>I have been fortunate enough to have received an offer from a match funder! Each donation from now until the end of July will be equally matched by a generous donor. Your contributions will now be doubled -- how exciting!!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>First, let me share my sincere and appreciative thanks, as your love and support of music has fueled my passion to continue pursuing a career in classical music.</p>
<p>Since graduating from Wartburg College with a Bachelor of Music, I moved to London to study Arts Administration, Cultural Policy and Music Management. I made the conscious decision to follow this path because of the stability and security the program would provide and the wealth of performing and growth opportunities in my vocal studies that London has to offer.</p>
<p>Through my coursework I undertook a self-management project and spent four months auditioning, taking lessons and coachings, rehearsing, applying for vocal programs and programming, marketing and performing in a solo recital. As an outcome of this I was selected to three prestigious programs and have a busy summer planned:</p>
<p>• <strong>June at Aldeburgh Festival:</strong> After applying in March, I was nearly immediately awarded one of 12 places on the Princess Margaret of Hesse and the Rhine Student Scheme at the Aldeburgh Festival. I just finished my week in Snape and Aldeburgh on the Eastern coast of England working behind the scenes of the Festival and performing at an end-of-week student programmed and performed recital. The concert was a success, and one couple even stopped me on their way out of the carpark to tell me how much they loved my voice and hope I continue singing! The funds you contribute will help reimburse my travel and subsistence costs associated with spending a week in Aldeburgh and Snape.</p>
<p>• <strong>July in Dartington:</strong> This residential school welcomes musicians of all nationalities, ages and abilities but has select advanced courses for students of exceptional talent and promise. I was selected to the advanced voice course, during which I will spend a week studying under the world-renowned and early music specialist soprano<strong> Dame Emma Kirkby </strong>while participating in several small ensembles and choirs. The funds you give will help pay for travel to/from Dartington, course fees, accommodation and three meals per day as well as entrance into all concerts and events during my stay.</p>
<p>•<strong>August in Abingdon:</strong> I was one of 65 singers accepted to attend this intensive training course for aspiring young singers. Led by expert and renowned teachers and professionals from top UK conservatoires, I will spent a week in master classes, lessons, movement and technique courses and performing both opera and song repertoire for peers and professionals. The ethos of the school is one of extreme hard work in a supportive and friendly atmosphere. Funds raised will contribute toward travel to/from Abingdon, course fees, accommodation, meals and all concerts and special events.</p>
<p>While I have been saving as much as possible and have received modest bursaries for each, I still need help to meet the expenses for the summer programs- approximately £1,500. I humbly ask for your assistance and continued support to help make up the difference.</p>
<h2><strong>Why Support Me?</strong></h2>
<p>The most common voice type in the opera world is a soprano. In the beginning<br/>of a career in opera, what can separate my name from those of other sopranos in are the experiences that help build stamina and artistry at a young age.</p>
<p>The growth to be had from a summer like this is vital. They will provide me with knowledge of my own voice as well as that of the industry, specifically in a British music context.</p>
<p>My voice teacher in Iowa, Dr. Jennifer Larson, told me earlier this year something that has helped me believe in the continuance of my studies. “If you aren’t practicing, someone else is. And when you meet her, she will beat you.” While this may be considered a negative outlook, it has given me the drive and ambition I needed to achieve success. If I don’t go for it, others will!</p>
<p>These experiences this summer will act as a catalyst to my confidence and career- they are happening for my benefit and will allow others to pick me out of a crowd of sopranos. The knowledge I gain will be indispensible and boost my acceleration into the world of classical music performance.</p>
<p>Also, all donors will be invited to a London venue to be determined, for a recital sharing my experiences and learning at the beginning of September!</p>

<h1><strong>In Just One Simple CD, I’ll Show You How To Start, End &amp; Live Each Day As The Amazing Parent You Strive To Be. </strong></h1>
<p>Dear Rockin’ Mamas (And Dads, You Rock Too),</p>
<p>I knew I had landed on a unique idea when I could confidently call myself “Cool as a Cucumber” during my son’s major meltdowns.   </p>
<p>I also knew I was onto something when my parent coaching clients started asking me to record our sessions so that they could listen to my guided visualizations over and over again. </p>
<p>Now, it’s time to get this CD on the market so that parents everywhere can have a quick and easy way to reset themselves and show up for their kids as completely awesome.  When we act consistently with our parenting goals and family values, we thrive.  And <strong>when we thrive, our kids thrive.</strong>  That’s what this CD is all about.  Listening to this CD inspires parents to stop their habit of barely surviving and build new practices of parenting with compassion, positivity and strategies that work.    </p>

<h1>
<strong>It’s Like A Quick Mental Yoga Workout For Parents</strong> </h1>
<p>I use these visualizations during parent coaching calls and my clients love them.   They are relaxing, practical and related to the core set of principles from which I coach, known as the “Rock Your Inner Mama Mantras.”  My clients wanted these recorded, so here we are, making a CD.   With this CD, I can help more parents say with confidence, “I’m cool as a cucumber,” and truly mean it.     </p>

<p>When I started my private practice as a PCI Certified Parent Coach® &amp; Strategist, I began seeing huge results in the lives of my clients AND in my own family.   I have two spirited boys who challenge me every day to rise above my ego and dig deep (inside and out) for strength and wisdom.  My children reap the benefits as much as I do.  We all reach a boiling point, and we all need support.   That’s why I’m creating this CD (to support you) and that’s why I’m here on IndieGogo (so you can support other parents).  Coaching and strategizing with parents is the most satisfying work I’ve ever done, and you’re making it possible to expand this offering on a whole new level.</p>

In Just One Simple CD, I’ll Show You How To Start, End & Live Each Day As The Amazing Parent You Strive To Be. 
Dear Rockin’ Mamas (And Dads, You Rock Too),
I knew I had landed on a unique idea when I could confidently call myself “Cool as a Cucumber” during my son’s major meltdowns.   
I also knew I was onto something when my parent coaching clients started asking me to record our sessions so that they could listen to my guided visualizations over and over again. 
Now, it’s time to get this CD on the market so that parents everywhere can have a quick and easy way to reset themselves and show up for their kids as completely awesome.  When we act consistently with our parenting goals and family values, we thrive.  And when we thrive, our kids thrive.  That’s what this CD is all about.  Listening to this CD inspires parents to stop their habit of barely surviving and build new practices of parenting with compassion, positivity and strategies that work.    
 

It’s Like A Quick Mental Yoga Workout For Parents 
I use these visualizations during parent coaching calls and my clients love them.   They are relaxing, practical and related to the core set of principles from which I coach, known as the “Rock Your Inner Mama Mantras.”  My clients wanted these recorded, so here we are, making a CD.   With this CD, I can help more parents say with confidence, “I’m cool as a cucumber,” and truly mean it.     
 


About To Fly Off The Handle?  Relax Your Body and Open Your Heart To A New Way Of Parenting  


Start the morning right with a 3-minute reminder of your parenting goals.
Listen in the car for 5 minutes before you pick your kids up from school or come home from a busy work day.
Prepare yourself for tricky transitions, meal time stress and bedtime battles.    
Say Good Night with a sense of peace, gratitude and compassion.  
Overcome insomnia as you fall asleep to soothing music and positive imagery. 
Learn how to set your intention to be a rockin’ parent in any circumstance.

<p>My name is Kartika Nair, and I have been passionate about composing and performing conscious and spiritual music for the past 8 years. I run a brand called ""Synchroshakti"" that is geared towards helping people empower themselves mentally, emotionally and spiritually. Music has always been a big part of how these empowering messages are translated to audiences across the world. Over the years I have composed a lot of original music, and now I am in the final stages of putting together a new album titled ""Love Unites Us"", under the genre of Reggae and conscious music.</p>
<h2>Inspiration came through!</h2>
<p>With the great success of the funding for the first music video project ""Love Unites Us"", I want to first thank everyone from the very bottom of my heart for contributing to make the previous music video campaign a massive success! I was blessed to continue receiving so much of your love and support even after the campaign goals were met. I feel truly blessed to have so many people believe in my music and this mission and I really hope I made you all proud! </p>
<h2>About this campaign!</h2>
<p>This is a campaign to fund my music video, that acts as a visual message to the people to not lose faith in their trying times and raise above their circumstances. The song speaks of the strife of human existence when faced with mental and emotional pain.  Then it emphasizes the fact that when we look within and find our own light and power, we can rise above our suffering.</p>
<p>To help raise the energy of the listener alongside uplift his spirit, this song “Look up” is very upbeat, very bright and has a groovy bassline that will make you want to jump up, dance and sing along to the catchy chorus, changing your mood altogether! The campaign is also important to me for the reason of being able to do my part in helping spread positive energy and also be given further opportunities to able to bring such empowering music to more people across the world.</p>
<p>""Look Up"" is produced by a Hungarian Label called Little Zion Studios, a connection brought together by Song Embassy from Kingston, Jamaica. </p>
<h3>What you will help me achieve</h3>
<p>By contributing to this project you will be an integral part of a conscious movement to bring more positive energy and positive messages to the ears of many who need it as well as creating another chapter in the history of reggae music in India. You will also be helping me create a video that represents Indian reggae to the world over.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The projects requires a total amount of $1000, which goes into the following areas:</p>
<p>1. Equipment: Hiring equipment (Camera, Lenses, Rigs) for a few days of shooting.</p>
<p>2. Lights (indoor &amp; outdoor)</p>
<p>3. Production: This video requires shots of nature, people, places and therefore the funds move towards transport, props, location scouting, studio rental, food etc.</p>
<p>4. Actors and presentation costs: Fee for makeup and presentation of additional individuals other than myself involved as characters within the music video</p>
<p>5. Video Crew: Director, DOP, Stylist , Makeup Artist &amp; Art Director</p>
<p>6. Post production costs: Video Editing and Color Grading.</p>
<h3>A unique perk!</h3>
<p>You are welcome to donate any amount you are comfortable with. Donations of $50 and above do get a special mention in the video credits.</p>
<p>All the funds collected regardless of meeting the entire goal will continue to be put into this production process until all the funds can be gathered to finish materializing the production.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution to this project will aid in bringing the power and influence of positive music to the hearts and minds of many, spreading the message of love, gratitude, community and self love and personal power to a world that is battling demons within themselves as well as within the structures of modern day society. This music personally took me out of very deep negative states and I am of firm conviction that it will bring more people like myself back into their hearts and smiling again!</p>
<p>Do you know that one song that brightens your day and makes you feel great? Where the beat, the groove, melodies and the lyrics just put you in that happy zone? Well this song will do the same for you and for many who chance upon it. We have enough music in the world that depresses us,and negatively conditions us, so let’s support and create music that brightens us up! We sure could use more positive music on our radios and televisions! Don’t you think?</p>
<p>I am a go- getter, a hard worker and I will do what it takes to get this labor of love ready and running because it is a core part of my purpose and path, and it is this determination that will help me overcome any hurdles that lie on the path to materializing this production.</p>
<p>If a donation is not possible for you, don't worry you can still contribute by spreading the word of this campaign across to others who also support positive music and positive movements for our society and the world. Make sure to use the Indiegogo sharing tools to spread the message far and wide!</p>
<p>My deepest thanks to everyone who is a part of this journey and this production, for your support goes beyond just me and to many across the world who would be grateful to receive the power of positive and groovy music in their lives.</p>

<p><span class=""notranlsate"">Operatunities - The Story</span> </p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate"">Operatunities was created by singer Carla Swedish as a ""win-win"" arts organization and community service organization; and as an answer to two questions.</span></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate"">As a singer, Carla had observed that there comes a point when finishing and performing one's work IS the work. This is why many advanced and professional level singers develop classical recitals or small cabarets of musical theatre material; invite their friends and family; and get themselves up in front of an audience. These recitals and small shows can cost the singer a fair amount of money to put together; and often it is necessarily a one-time performance. While repeated performance of material is yet the next step for an artist's development and is of great value to the artist; it is not always possible. So, Carla's first question was ""where are the venues where a singer can develop at this level of their work, performing for an appreciative audience, without having to ""pay to perform""?</span></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate"">Meanwhile, Carla's Mom, while living in a retirement community, went from independent living to assisted living to skilled nursing; and Carla noticed that the quality and quantity of the artistic, enriching experiences to which her mother had access dramatically decreased. In full agreement with statistics that music is healing to mind, body and spirit; Carla's second question was ""how can I provide quality musical performances to the people who would appreciate it and benefit the most; but whose access has become limited?""</span></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate"">Operatunities was therefore born to bring advanced and professional level singers with finished, quality classical or ""classic"" musical programs right into retirement and other types of care communities; thus providing singers with venues, and under-served audiences with quality programming. To date, Operatunities has presented 3 different programs by 2 different singers for a total of 10 times at 4 different venues.</span></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate"">We are not only repeating venues, but we are seeing repeat individual audience members as well. Audiences really seem to love what we are offering. There is always a natural receiving line after the performances when individuals come up to thank us for performing. They tell stories about how they used to sing or play piano or attend opera on a regular basis; and there is a very clear and rewarding sense that we have provided an uplifting and valuable experience.</span></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate"">The venues are all getting into the spirit of Operatunities, making the programs special by serving refreshments or arranging the room to reflect the theme or feel of the music. An unexpected benefit is that Operatunities is providing an event that brings family members of residents in to share an experience with residents. It is lovely to see children and/or the caretaking spouse be able to step out of that role and just ""be"" with their loved one.</span></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate"">Operatunities is committed to exponentially increasing its number of singers, programs and venues. That makes raising the money to make these programs possible Operatunities' current number one priority. Funds donated to Operatunities will be used to subsidize finished, advanced or professional level vocal performances for deserving audiences, while providing venues for deserving singers.</span></p></div>","Operatunities - The Story

<p>Thank you for checking out this campaign to support the release of The Dead XIII’s second studio album! You probably clicked a link we (or someone you know) shared to get here, so it’s likely you already know who we are, but just in case you don’t….</p>
<p><br/>The Dead XIII are a 5-piece band from the UK, we are purveyors of the darker side of metal. In 2015 we released our critically acclaimed debut album, Catacombs. It set the scene for our unique take on horror metal. We are especially proud of gaining a 4K review and being named in the writer’s top 10 albums of the year by Kerrang!</p>
<p><br/>We want to be able to release the best album we possibly can. We wouldn’t be here today if it wasn’t for your support, so by providing you this opportunity to be part of the process, we are hoping together we can do something incredible.</p>
<p><br/>We hear a lot of people saying that the music industry is dead and that bands can’t survive, in some ways that is true, but we are proud of our fans, our Army Of The Dead, who have been the great force behind us being able to do what we do.</p>
<p><br/><strong>So what’s the deal?</strong></p>
<p><br/>We are using this campaign to offer advance sales of the CD version of the album, along with some other great perks that you won’t find anywhere else. Simply having advanced sales removes some of the financial risk that we face and helps us fund essential promotional and marketing opportunities that we may not be able to do otherwise. The old school method says that we pay for everything in the hope people buy the album when it’s released, so this just flips that and gives you the opportunity to support the process as well as the finished album. It allows us to get the record into your hands quicker and gets us back out on the road meeting you guys sooner.</p>
<p><br/>We've put together some fantastic perks as part of the campaign including Skype Lessons, signed cymbals, drum heads, exclusive T-Shirts and as its nearly Christmas we will be producing official ‘The Dead XIII Christmas cards’ personally signed by all of the band. Every single order will include a personalized note thanking you for helping!</p>
<p><br/><strong>This campaign will be the ONLY place to pre-order the album in CD format for release day. So, if you pledge, as a thank you for support you will be the first people to get a copy of the album.</strong><br/><br/><strong>#TheGhostsAreWaiting</strong></p>

<p><strong>Why are you asking for SO MUCH MONEY?</strong></p>
<p>To be clear, we ARE NOT ASKING FOR MONEY FOR OURSELVES. This money is going RIGHT BACK into what will prove to be an amazing album FOR YOU!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What's so SPECIAL about the Special / Limited Edition Album?</strong></p>
<p>The album you're pre-ordering will have special-edition cover art (clearly distinguishing your copy from the mass-release version later) and a <strong>BONUS TRACK</strong> that will NOT be on the mass-released version. Think of it as a special song that you get to be one of the few to own. As such, if this album is successful, you'll have something that may be very valuable in the future!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>And the Poster and T-Shirt?</strong></p>
<p>They'll contain special-edition art as well; which will be discontinued after we get them out to our backers from this campaign. So, again, you'll be one of the few to have one. And, again, if this album blows up, you'll have a piece of rock history that may be of greater value in the future.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What songs will be on the new album?</strong></p>
<p>We've been working diligently to write and pre-produce works that we're confident you'll fall in love with. Though listing names won't really do much, here are a few of the track names that you'll see on the upcoming album: ""Safety Net"", ""Fantasy"", and ""The One"".</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What songs are on the Next September debut (that I also get)?</strong></p>
<p>Check out the ""Gallery"" tab for some samples. :)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Am I guaranteed to receive the things I order, even if you don't make funding?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Regardless of how well we do here, you WILL get everything promised to you. </p>
<p> </p>
<strong>When will I get my stuff?</strong>
</div>
<div>
<p>Downloads of the Next September demo album, <em>Next September</em>, will become available immediately following this campaign.</p>
<p>Posters and T-shirts will arrive first (usually within 60 days from the close of this campaign).</p>
<p>The new album will drop no later than January 2014, although we're hoping for a September 2013 release.</p>
<p>Live events must be scheduled individually...</p>

<h3>It's time for an album of original music!</h3>
<p>The Michelle Taylor Band has been rocking venues all over Western Washington for almost seven years! From clubs, to casinos, to festivals, and even at CenturyLink Field playing for the Seahawks' fans, the band has performed for crowds of all musical tastes. We've been packing dance floors with covers of popular songs across multiples genres, including blues, rock, country, and pop music, but now it's time for an album of our original songs!</p>
<p>We have enjoyed delivering musical excellence and a fun, entertaining show for our fans and friends, with a setlist of cover tunes that you all know and love. Over the years, we have also included many original songs that you have also embraced and enjoyed. Now, we want to release an album of those original songs, both for your listening pleasure and to establish ourselves as a band of talented musicians that are passionate about our craft, eager to share our creativity with a broader audience.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>We need your help to create an excellent album!</h3>
<p>We are asking all of you to help us in achieving this goal. The saying, ""you get what you pay for,"" is true, and in this instance it isn't a cheap endeavor. To create an excellent album requires not only an investment of our time and talents, it requires a significant monetary investment.</p>
<p>We have calculated a cost of about $12,000 to produce an album of the quality that we would like to deliver for you. All of the money raised through this campaign will go directly toward the creation of this album.</p>
<p>No contribution is too small! While we do have a significant monetary goal, it can be achieved with the help of many. Every contribution makes an impact! All of your contributions will be rewarded not only with our undying gratitude, but also with perks for you! On this page, you can see some of those perks as determined by the size of the contribution.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>To provide an excellent album, we need a quality studio.</h3>
<p>Our last album was lots of fun for us and well-received by our fans. It was a live studio recording, but in the setting of an intimate party with many of our fans, friends, and family. That album was primarily cover songs with one of our originals. This album is of a different, much larger scope in that it will be all original songs, created with the passion of each member of this band.</p>
<p>In order to produce what we feel will be the best quality album, we will be recording at London Bridge Studio in Seattle. For 30 years bands have made the trek to London Bridge Studio creating memorable music for fans of all types.  They have recorded amazing artists like, Pearl Jam, Alice In Chains, Mother Love Bone, Soundgarden, Temple Of The Dog, Blind Melon, Fleet Foxes, Macklemore and Ryan Lewis, and so many more.  London Bridge has the experience and reputation for excellence that we need.</p>
<p>Those of you that know us, have seen our shows, and heard our music, know that we have the talent and the drive to make this album a success. We have had a wonderful journey as a band with you, our fans and friends.  We want to continue this journey with you and achieve yet another level of excellence with this album.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help.</h3>
<p>Some people just aren't able to contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help!  Please help us to get the word out and make some noise about this campaign!  Indiegogo has tools for sharing, and most of you are able to share this across different social media outlets.  And don't forget word-of-mouth sharing!  We have a wonderful group of friends, and if y'all share this with your friends, and they share with their friends, and so on, and so on... you get the picture!  We can achieve this goal together!</p>

<h3>Sweet Noireen &amp; Other Assorted Love Songs.. a new classic rock album!</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi everyone! We would like to introduce ourselves to you. We are Desperados d'Amour, a classic rock / Southern rock band from the Netherlands. Being active since late 2010, we have now built up a batch of original songs. Because of the good response we get at our live shows, we have now decided to bring out our first album. The band consists of Grant E. Love (voc/gtr), Ton ""The Manimal"" Van Dijk (dr), Jesse Brock (b/voc) and Richard VanderLinden (gtr). the albumj will be produced and mixed by Djuri Boot, one of Hollands finest music producers.</p>
<p>As an unsiged band, we fund the album with the money we make of our live gigs. Unfortunately, we don't make enough money at the moment to fund the whole proces yet, although we do a good job so far. We feel that our songs have the quality to be released on an album so we can bring them to a bigger audience, and we hope you want to help us to achieve that goal. We love classic rock, blues rock and southern rock and we want to make our addition to the genre with our album.</p>
<p>If you help us, then you help us to make a dream come true, releasing an album and make our music more known to the rock audiences around the world. Like a lot of other colleague musicians, we have to pay our rents, buy food, you know: the usual things you do to keep yourself alive. We have worked really hard to produce great songs, and because we want to deliver a quality CD album, we have started this crowdfunding project to make it happen!</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need € 5000 to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Finish the recordings</strong>. So far, we have finished one complete song (which you can hear in the video on this page) and have recorded the basic tracks (drums, bass and guitars) for most other songs.We need a part of the funds to record the vocals, backing vocals and a few lead guitars. The album will have 11 tracks.</li>
<li>
<strong>The final mix</strong>. Once all the parts have been recorded, a part of the funds is used to make a real killer mix of the songs. After all, we want our songs to sound the best they can!</li>
<li>
<strong>The artwork</strong>. Ofcourse a CD album needs cool artwork, and we know just the person who designs the most beautiful artworks that will do our album justice!</li>
<li>
<strong>The mastering.</strong> Essential for the sound of an album. We want to master our album at the world famous <em>Wisseloord Studios</em> in Hilversum, The Netherlands to make sure the album sounds every bit as great as it should sound. We stand for quality, and we feel that everyone who supports us with releasing our album should get the quality they deserve!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>We have a few perks, as you can see on this page. We appreciate all the support we get! However, we have some cool perks for the people from The Netherlands who decide they want to pledge a little more than the standard pack, like a music lesson of 60 minutes by a bandmember of their choice, or even an acoustic performance of the band in their livingroom or at their party! And ofcourse your name will be included in the liner notes of the album!</p>
<p>Oh and.. if we don't reach our entire goal, we will still make the album with the funds we do have!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't help us financially, you can still help us! Just let your friends that love classic rock (think of bands like Thin Lizzy, AC/.DC, ZZ Top, Lynyrd Skynyrd and others) know of our crowdfunding project! Let's create a buzz around this album! We believe in it, and it's awesome if you believe in it, too! We will be eternally grateful for this! Sharing the campaign is pretty easy: on this page you will find a tool to share it with you friends, on Facebook for instance!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you so much for helping us!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With much gratitude:</p>
<p>Grant, Ton, Jesse and Richard</p></span></span></span></span></div>","Sweet Noireen & Other Assorted Love Songs.. a new classic rock album!

This is no typical music lesson. There are no wrong notes. There is no one way to make music!</p><p>These children have dedicated precious recess time to advance their music abilities and harness their creativity in a socially engaging setting. Live performances, recordings and improvised jams have aided in the creation of new friendships. The culture of jamming encourages musical experimentation, trying new instruments, making mistakes and turning them into beats! Above all, the children are pumped to be at Jam Club, one more reason to get excited to be at school!</p><h3>How it's Funded</h3><p>This program has been funded by the families of this school on a pay-if-you-can basis.

This is no typical music lesson. There are no wrong notes. There is no one way to make music!These children have dedicated precious recess time to advance their music abilities and harness their creativity in a socially engaging setting. Live performances, recordings and improvised jams have aided in the creation of new friendships. The culture of jamming encourages musical experimentation, trying new instruments, making mistakes and turning them into beats! Above all, the children are pumped to be at Jam Club, one more reason to get excited to be at school!How it's FundedThis program has been funded by the families of this school on a pay-if-you-can basis.

<p>Kent Goolsby is the former frontman of Murfreesboro, TN's now defunct <strong>Only Sons</strong>, who shared the stage with Jason Isbell, Those Darlins, Glossary, American Aquarium &amp; Two Cow Garage along with many, many other great artists. Since his time with The Only Sons, Kent has continued to tour &amp; fine-tune new material for his debut album and after 9 months of breaking them in on the road, <strong>10</strong> songs have made the cut. </p>
<p><em><strong>""Trophies Of Youth""</strong> </em>is a full band effort, with Nashville, TN's <strong>The Folks</strong> serving as the backing band, which is made up of <strong>Steve Daly</strong> (guitar, steel, vocals), <strong>Dan Eubanks </strong>(upright bass/electric bass) &amp; <strong>Shakey Fowlkes</strong> (drums). <strong>Glossary's Joey Kneiser</strong> will handle the mixing, recording &amp; mastering.<strong> </strong>The album is the most cohesive collection of songs Kent has ever arranged with a sound that leans more towards roots music/americana than the later part of The Only Sons output. It draws influence from <strong>New Morning-era Bob Dylan</strong> as well as <strong>The Band</strong> and <strong>John Prine</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Full disclosure: </strong>We are a 100% <strong>DIY</strong> band and your help is genuinely appreciated and needed. The funds raised through this pre-order/fundraiser will go <strong>directly</strong> to the cost of recording the album which includes the musicians, studio engineer, studio time and post-production. With <span>IndieGoGo there are perks for every contribution, which means that individuals can contribute as little or as much as they'd like based on the items they would like to receive. It's important to note that <strong>ANY</strong><strong> </strong>contribution will help bring us one step closer to our goal! </span></p>
<p><strong>Last chance on Only Sons swag:</strong> If you contribute to a perk that comes with a Kent T-Shirt and/or Koozie you will also receive an Only Sons T-Shirt/Koozie. This is on a first come, first served basis due to supplies. The site will updated when they are gone. Contributing $45 and up? Missing an Only Sons album? Perks in the $45-$100 range will also come with a digital download of The Only Sons entire discography! That's 4 albums!</p>
<p><strong>Thank you</strong> for your interest and support! We can't wait to share these songs with you.</p>

Kent Goolsby is the former frontman of Murfreesboro, TN's now defunct Only Sons, who shared the stage with Jason Isbell, Those Darlins, Glossary, American Aquarium & Two Cow Garage along with many, many other great artists. Since his time with The Only Sons, Kent has continued to tour & fine-tune new material for his debut album and after 9 months of breaking them in on the road, 10 songs have made the cut. 
""Trophies Of Youth"" is a full band effort, with Nashville, TN's The Folks serving as the backing band, which is made up of Steve Daly (guitar, steel, vocals), Dan Eubanks (upright bass/electric bass) & Shakey Fowlkes (drums). Glossary's Joey Kneiser will handle the mixing, recording & mastering. The album is the most cohesive collection of songs Kent has ever arranged with a sound that leans more towards roots music/americana than the later part of The Only Sons output. It draws influence from New Morning-era Bob Dylan as well as The Band and John Prine. 
Full disclosure: We are a 100% DIY band and your help is genuinely appreciated and needed. The funds raised through this pre-order/fundraiser will go directly to the cost of recording the album which includes the musicians, studio engineer, studio time and post-production. With IndieGoGo there are perks for every contribution, which means that individuals can contribute as little or as much as they'd like based on the items they would like to receive. It's important to note that ANY contribution will help bring us one step closer to our goal! 
Last chance on Only Sons swag: If you contribute to a perk that comes with a Kent T-Shirt and/or Koozie you will also receive an Only Sons T-Shirt/Koozie. This is on a first come, first served basis due to supplies. The site will updated when they are gone. Contributing $45 and up? Missing an Only Sons album? Perks in the $45-$100 range will also come with a digital download of The Only Sons entire discography! That's 4 albums!
Thank you for your interest and support! We can't wait to share these songs with you.
You can check out non-album verisons of ""Jesus Is My Landlord"" & ""Two By Two""- two fresh tracks that will appear on ""Trophies Of Youth"" at www.facebook.com/kentgoolsbymusic.
All t-shirts, koozies & posters are printed locally in Nashville, TN by Grand Palace Silkscreen.

<p>Nach der Veröffentlichung der ersten Single „Back Son“ ist das musikalische Projekt <strong>„hope will lead“</strong> stetig gewachsen und 2017 nun groß geworden.<br/>Es stehen der Singer-Songwriterin <strong>Carina Stockinger</strong> Künstler aus (fast) allen Sparten zur Seite. Neben MusikerInnen, Audioprofis, und TänzerInnen entsteht nun mit dem Jungregisseur <strong>Jura Branellec</strong> die visuelle Umsetzung des Projekts.<br/>Nachdenkliche Texte &amp; melancholisch-kraftvolle Melodien gehen Hand in Hand mit Tanz &amp; entführen in eine eigene Welt die innerlich wie äußerlich tiefgreifend bewegt. Interdisziplinäre Zusammenarbeit ist somit ein Schlüsselelement von „hope will lead“.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Warum ist dieses Projekt so wichtig</h3>
<p><strong>„The Ones In Power“</strong> trägt eine starke Message &amp; die wollen wir mit eurer Hilfe transportieren! Und womit kann man heutzutage schon schneller &amp; besser Aufmerksamkeit erregen als mit einem richtig guten Musikvideo? – Eben!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Worum geht es?</h3>Unsere Welt ist geprägt von permanentem Medienkonsum &amp; es ist richtig schwer noch zu unterscheiden was wahr/falsch, gut/böse, gesund/ungesund ist weil wir tagtäglich mit konträren Botschaften konfrontiert sind. Meist sind Medien darauf abgezielt uns in eine bestimmte Richtung zu lenken. Sie beeinflussen uns permanent, meist unterbewusst, in einer hektischen Welt, die kaum noch Zeit für kritisches Hinterfragen bietet &amp; macht uns nach und nach zu Konsumsklaven, zu blinden Handlangern der Interessen großer Konzerne.<br/>Dabei sind wir schöpferische Wesen, mit Meinung, Haltung, Bewusstsein. Wir sind individuell, vielfältig, einzigartig.<br/>Dies wollen wir in unserem Musikvideo zu „The Ones In Power“ mittels symbolhaften Darstellungen unserer Gesellschaft umringt von „Steuerungsmechanismen“ zeigen.<br/>Doch das innere Kind wird siegen, soviel sei verraten – repräsentiert durch die Tanzgruppe „Momentos Wien“ – werden die militärhaft gleichgeschaltenen Funktionsmenschen zum Leben erweckt &amp; hinterfragen das ewige Spiel.</div><div>
<p><br/>Das Drehbuch ist noch nicht komplett. Wir arbeiten laufend &amp; intensiv an der Fertigstellung &amp; Perfektionierung des Storyboards. Gut' Ding braucht eben Weile!</p>

<h3>Wofür brauchen wir Geld &amp; was können wir zurückgeben</h3>
<p>Die Teilnahme aller technischen sowie künstlerischen Kräfte beruht auf Begeisterung für das Projekt, daher bemüht sich unsere Kampagne ausschließlich um Materialkostenersatz.<br/>Außerdem benötigen wir Unterstützung für etwaige Drehortgebühr, Verpflegung, Kostüme, Anfahrtskosten, Parkscheine, Leihgebühr Kamera/Licht Equipment, Posterdruck etc.<br/>Dafür werden laut unseren Hochrechnungen ca. 2.400€ benötigt.</p>
<p>Unsere Unterstützer und Unterstützerinnen erhalten für unterschiedliche Beiträge eine Vielzahl an Perks (=Vergünstigungen), angefangen von EPs mit persönlicher Widmung für 15€ bis hin zu einem akustischen Privatkonzert (innerhalb Österreichs) von ""hope will lead"" (natürlich inkl. Carina &amp; 1 bis 2 Begleitinstrumenten) zum individuellen Wunschanlass um 1.000€. Dazwischen gibt es noch viele interessante Perks wie beispielsweise eine exklusive Gesangsstunde bei Carina oder Jura gibt dir eine Einführung in Kameratechnik, zwischen 90 und 120€.<br/><br/><strong>Du hast keine oder wenig Finanzmittel, willst uns aber trotzdem oder zusätzlich zu Deinem Beitrag unterstützen?</strong></p>

Since then we've gone on to headline iconic churches, perform in sold out venues and make waves across London as 'A band you simply have to hear' (17 Seconds) and 'Pure, perfect, sweet pop' (Clash Magazine).<span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span>Since September, we've spent over 100 hours writing and recording our debut release, a 3 track EP of 'refreshingly bold, playful and undoubtedly infectious' art-pop dealing with some of the lightest and darkest parts of life, death and growing. It's something we are hugely proud of and can't wait to share with you. <span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span>We are also delighted to have been invited to take the EP on tour around the UK by performing at some of the best venues in cities including London, Liverpool, Manchester, Edinburgh and Cardiff this April.</span></span></p>
<p>We are unsigned, unmanaged and truly independent, so being given the opporunity to tour and release our record is crucial to our development. We hope that with your help we can take our band to the next stage of our career this summer!</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get<span><br/></span>

</div></div>","Short Summary 10 months ago in a tiny London bedroom, 3 friends wrote their first song together called 'Feel The Weight' and decided then it was time to form a band. Since then we've gone on to headline iconic churches, perform in sold out venues and make waves across London as 'A band you simply have to hear' (17 Seconds) and 'Pure, perfect, sweet pop' (Clash Magazine).Since September, we've spent over 100 hours writing and recording our debut release, a 3 track EP of 'refreshingly bold, playful and undoubtedly infectious' art-pop dealing with some of the lightest and darkest parts of life, death and growing. It's something we are hugely proud of and can't wait to share with you. We are also delighted to have been invited to take the EP on tour around the UK by performing at some of the best venues in cities including London, Liverpool, Manchester, Edinburgh and Cardiff this April.
We are unsigned, unmanaged and truly independent, so being given the opporunity to tour and release our record is crucial to our development. We hope that with your help we can take our band to the next stage of our career this summer!   What We Need & What You Get
 All recording, mixing and mastering costs have been covered by the band through full time work, busking and saving but now we need your help to raise funds for the release and tour.- We aim to raise £2000 for the EP release, this includes artwork, manufacturing, PR and distribution.- We aim to raise £1500 for the UK tour, this includes van hire, merchandise, PR and accommodation.In return, we've put together a bunch of (what we hope are) rather lovely perks for pledgers, from being the first to receive a limited edition copy of the EP and being on our guest list for a year, to having us throw you a house gig. We'll even bring cheese and pineapple on sticks.
    The Impact It would be very arrogant for us to say our music will have an impact on the world. But what we do know is continuing to make it and sharing it on record and with live audiences is something that brings us so much happiness and something which we would like to continue to do this summer.We've never crowdfunded so we don't know what to expect! But what we do know is no matter how much we raise, we are eternally grateful for all of your support so far and can't wait to share what we've been working on with you!LoveMel, Kill & IzzyPLAYING HOUSE

I wrote and composed all the songs in this album by myself, and recorded most of it in our home studio, in our tiny apartment in Berlin.Why do I need your support?It took me years to write and compose this album that I am so proud of as an artist, and the finish line is almost here.But now comes the most expensive part, dealing with final production, mixing, mastering and printing it.And because I want the best quality for this album, so my audience could have it in the best way possible, the price tag is high and I need 7000 Euros to be able to release this album and present my new music to this world.I am doing the best I can to fund this album, I work in a music school, I teach piano and vocal lessons and try to perform as much as I can, but there is no way I can do it without your support.How can you support my cause?Well, you can buy the new album or the previous ones I released. Book Skype lessons with me, purchase handwritten lyrics from the new album, Book a home concert, let me guide in a Berlin tour and so much more!There are much more perks inside, just pick one of the awesome perks I created for you.Your support means a lot to me, that’s the only way I can release this album! Oh, and one last thing! every perk you purchase includes a digital copy of my album, because sharing my music with you means the world to me.",0.0,2,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">A DEUX is the musical and personal marriage of Claude
Pineault and Eden Atwood. Claude and Eden “met” through shared musical friends
on Facebook and began corresponding and soon after collaborating musically. Claude
is a well-known singer/songwriter/producer from Montreal with several number one
hits to his credit. Eden is best known for her work as a jazz singer. She has
12 full length CDs to her credit and has been heralded as “one of the most
undersung heroes in modern jazz history.” </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Claude and Eden immediately felt kinship with one another
musically. Their musical partnership began with finding material that the native
English speaking jazz singer and the native French speaking songwriter had in
common…what else? The Beatles. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Claude and Eden took such songs as I Will and Help and began
creating what would become their signature sound…a spare, acoustic duo merging
smart pop and jazz sensibilities into soulful duets.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Claude and Eden soon fell in love and married in February
2010. Claude moved to Montana the following summer to open Pinewood Studios
with his new wife. Since that move, Claude has produced a number one album for
Hugo Lapointe out of Pinewood Studios with his partner in Montreal, Jeff
Grenier. Eden has been travelling to Japan and has produced two jazz records
for a Japanese label. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Currently, Claude and Eden are working on their first full
length CD, eponymously titled, A DEUX. A DEUX will feature several new original songs from Claude
and Eden as well as new acoustic versions of some of Claude’s hits including
MON ANGE and JE PENSE ENCORE A TOI. The new CD will also feature the two newly
arranged Beatles’ songs I WILL and HELP that provided the score for their
musical and personal partnership.<span style=""""> 
</span>The result is a unique and soulful new duo whose sole goal is to share
their music and happiness with whomever wants to listen. </p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The biggest issue facing full time professional musicians is sustainability. Add raising kids to the mix and it can get downright dicey! That is why Indie Go Go is so brilliant. YOU...the folks we make music for...can help us continue to be creatively productive without the need of a record label or publicity team as well as providing us with a sustainable way to raise our family and stay local most of the time. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have a studio in our converted garage that has already produced a number 1 record in Quebec. We have already laid down the basic tracks for most of our recording. But we need money for graphics/reproduction/distribution. We estimate that we need right around $8,000.00 to finish our project and get it on the shelves and onto online distribution. If we don't reach our entire goal we will get as far as we can with the funds raised and then continue to squirrel away what we can over time to finish the project.

</div></div>","Our Story


A DEUX is the musical and personal marriage of Claude
Pineault and Eden Atwood. Claude and Eden “met” through shared musical friends
on Facebook and began corresponding and soon after collaborating musically. Claude
is a well-known singer/songwriter/producer from Montreal with several number one
hits to his credit. Eden is best known for her work as a jazz singer. She has
12 full length CDs to her credit and has been heralded as “one of the most
undersung heroes in modern jazz history.” 

 
Claude and Eden immediately felt kinship with one another
musically. Their musical partnership began with finding material that the native
English speaking jazz singer and the native French speaking songwriter had in
common…what else? The Beatles. 

 
Claude and Eden took such songs as I Will and Help and began
creating what would become their signature sound…a spare, acoustic duo merging
smart pop and jazz sensibilities into soulful duets.

 
Claude and Eden soon fell in love and married in February
2010. Claude moved to Montana the following summer to open Pinewood Studios
with his new wife. Since that move, Claude has produced a number one album for
Hugo Lapointe out of Pinewood Studios with his partner in Montreal, Jeff
Grenier. Eden has been travelling to Japan and has produced two jazz records
for a Japanese label. 

 
Currently, Claude and Eden are working on their first full
length CD, eponymously titled, A DEUX. A DEUX will feature several new original songs from Claude
and Eden as well as new acoustic versions of some of Claude’s hits including
MON ANGE and JE PENSE ENCORE A TOI. The new CD will also feature the two newly
arranged Beatles’ songs I WILL and HELP that provided the score for their
musical and personal partnership. 
The result is a unique and soulful new duo whose sole goal is to share
their music and happiness with whomever wants to listen. 



The Impact
The biggest issue facing full time professional musicians is sustainability. Add raising kids to the mix and it can get downright dicey! That is why Indie Go Go is so brilliant. YOU...the folks we make music for...can help us continue to be creatively productive without the need of a record label or publicity team as well as providing us with a sustainable way to raise our family and stay local most of the time. 


What We Need & What You Get
We have a studio in our converted garage that has already produced a number 1 record in Quebec. We have already laid down the basic tracks for most of our recording. But we need money for graphics/reproduction/distribution. We estimate that we need right around $8,000.00 to finish our project and get it on the shelves and onto online distribution. If we don't reach our entire goal we will get as far as we can with the funds raised and then continue to squirrel away what we can over time to finish the project. Our funders will get digital downloads of the music we have finished and, of course, hard copies when we finish the project. 

If you donate $20.00: You get a signed finished CD!

If you donate $50.00: You get everything above AND a signed poster!

If you donate $100.00: You get everything above AND a thank you in the liner notes!

If you donate $200.00: You get everything above AND a Tshirt!

If you donate $500.00: You get everything above AND any song of your choice specially arranged and recorded by us and sent to you as a digital download!

If you donate $1000.00: You get everything above AND a private 60 minute concert in your home (if you live within 200 miles of Missoula,MT or if farther way, on SKYPE!

If you donate $1500.00: You get everything above AND your name listed as EXECUTIVE PRODUCER on our CD!

<h3>Our (Musical) Foreign Exchange Program</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">In the summer of 2014, we hosted our friends of folk pop band BandàpArt (France) in the United States, and in 2015, we toured France with them (thanks to generous financial contributions from people like you!!)</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">It was an AMAZING time with them in France, full of long days and nights traveling from show to show, the creation of weird inside jokes, and some of the best live show experiences we've ever had as a band.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">Again last year, BandàpArt returned to the United States, and so now it's our turn, in our fun foreign band exchange program of sorts, to head back overseas - this time to bring our music to several European countries!!</p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">So far, we have dates booked in Spain on the Mediterranean coast, the 2-day festival BandàpArt produces (similar to our SD GypsyFest), at least one date in Germany, and then back to France for an amazing festival as the grand finale!! (And we are working on more!!)</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">International travel is expensive and touring in a five-piece band can be pretty costly. The estimated cost of five international flights (and taking into consideration the 5% IndieGoGo fee), we will need to raise $10,000 by May 15. If we aren't able to raise at least 90% of that, we're in jeopardy of not being able to go. If we are fortunate enough that contributions exceed this goal, any additional money will go toward a per diem, other travel costs, promotional materials, and any unforeseen costs that arise when on tour.</p>

</div></div>","European Tour 2017
We are QUEL BORDEL! - an energetic five-piece world punk band based out of San Diego. We need the help of our friends, fans, and supporters so that we may tour Europe this summer!!
We can only do this with your support!!

Our (Musical) Foreign Exchange Program
In the summer of 2014, we hosted our friends of folk pop band BandàpArt (France) in the United States, and in 2015, we toured France with them (thanks to generous financial contributions from people like you!!)
It was an AMAZING time with them in France, full of long days and nights traveling from show to show, the creation of weird inside jokes, and some of the best live show experiences we've ever had as a band.
Again last year, BandàpArt returned to the United States, and so now it's our turn, in our fun foreign band exchange program of sorts, to head back overseas - this time to bring our music to several European countries!!

QUEL BORDEL! & BandàpArt at Crestone Music Festival 2016
What We Need
So far, we have dates booked in Spain on the Mediterranean coast, the 2-day festival BandàpArt produces (similar to our SD GypsyFest), at least one date in Germany, and then back to France for an amazing festival as the grand finale!! (And we are working on more!!)
International travel is expensive and touring in a five-piece band can be pretty costly. The estimated cost of five international flights (and taking into consideration the 5% IndieGoGo fee), we will need to raise $10,000 by May 15. If we aren't able to raise at least 90% of that, we're in jeopardy of not being able to go. If we are fortunate enough that contributions exceed this goal, any additional money will go toward a per diem, other travel costs, promotional materials, and any unforeseen costs that arise when on tour.

For Our Backers
We are offering some pretty cool rewards this time around, most of them being limited-edition, personalized items or exclusive experiences.
Beyond the physical or experience rewards, we hope, as a backer, that you also feel the reward of contributing to QUEL BORDEL! - in helping us deepen our musical and cultural roots, gain inspiration by sharing and creating music in new countries, and strengthen our valued friendship with BandàpArt, which goes beyond any language barrier. It would also mean a lot that you'd be providing us with an experience above and beyond what we ever thought was possible when QUEL BORDEL! was formed.
We hope to be able to give back to you through these rewards, but also by sharing our experience with you along the way and in our future performances.

<h3>My name is Natalie and I'm an opera singer.</h3>
<h3>This summer, I have been given the incredible opportunity to study the art of classical singing in Payerbach, Austria. </h3>
<h3 style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">But to make this happen, I need your help.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I need to raise $5,000 to be able to attend. This money will help cover the cost of tuition as well as housing and travel expenses.  </p>
<p>Any amount helps, and I am incredibly grateful for any show of support.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>This is a once in a lifetime opportunity.</h3>
<p>Only a dozen young singers from across the country were chosen to participate in this highly selective program. After having completed my Masters Degree in music, this is the next step toward achieving my dream of having a serious opera career. This program will give me the opportuninty to work one-on-one with world-renowned voice and acting teachers, music coaches and conductors. It will also provide me with incredible performce opportunities in Europe. This kind of program is invaluable for a young singer's performance experience and resume, and having participated will help me secure singing positions in the future, ensuring the advancement of my career.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Come to my Masters Recital and Benefit Concert!!!</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>I will be presenting a program of art songs, chamber works and operatic arias at <em><strong>8pm on June 29th, 2012</strong></em> at The Parish of Calvary St. George's, a beautiful historic church located at 277 Park Avenue South</h3>
<p>Whether you donate or not, I would absolutely love for you to attend my Masters Recital. A singer isn't worth very much without an audience, so please come and bring your friends.  In fact, feel free to invite everyone you know! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Please spread the word.</h3>
<p>If you have friends who love the arts, invite them to support an emerging young artist. If your friends have nothing better to do on a friday night (and what's better than spending your evening listening to wonderful music?), invite them to the concert. Email this link to your family members, put it on your facebook wall, tweet it to all and sundry. If everyone who comes to my concert brings one friend, my audience doubles.  And if every friend you bring to the concert donates even $10 or $15, I may just raise enough money to pay for this program after all. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>All of your support goes towards helping me create magic.</h3>
<p>As a young girl, my grandmother would take me to the Metropolitan Opera, where the soaring voices swept me along with them to exotic places and fairy-tale lands. Hansel and Gretel came to life, Cinderella found her prince, and happily-ever-afters were accompanied by beautiful music. The people onstage had the ability to transport their audience to a different time and place using nothing more than a few well-placed, expressive notes. The things an opera singer could relate through song seemed incredible and the stories they acted out, combined with lavish costumes and larger-than-life sets made opera-going a magical experience. </p>
<p>I have learned quite a bit since those early forays into the world of opera, and I now know the incredible amount of work that goes into creating operatic magic. What seems completely effortless onstage is actually the product of years of vocal training, language study, research, memorization, interpretation and collaboration.  </p>
<p>And this program is my opportunity to become a part of it all. In Austria, I will get the training and experience I need to start creating my own pieces of opera magic. And I thank you for being a part of that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Thank you so much for your time and support,</h3>

I have learned quite a bit since those early forays into the world of opera, and I now know the incredible amount of work that goes into creating operatic magic. What seems completely effortless onstage is actually the product of years of vocal training, language study, research, memorization, interpretation and collaboration.  
And this program is my opportunity to become a part of it all. In Austria, I will get the training and experience I need to start creating my own pieces of opera magic. And I thank you for being a part of that.
 
 
 
Thank you so much for your time and support,
 I look forward to seeing you on June 29th!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Be a part of Inner Missing</h3>
<p>Hello! We are Inner Missing, a duo from St. Petersburg, Russia. Our music is characterised by such terms as gothic/doom metal, dark metal, operatic metal, avant-garde metal and so on - we prefer to say that it is intelligent metal with operatic baritone vocals (Sounds incongruous? Check our latest album on our official bandcamp page: <a href=""https://innermissing.bandcamp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://innermissing.bandcamp.com</a>). We never stopped experimenting with composition, sound and different types of vocals - as a result we have recorded 5 absolutely different albums by now and we are not going to stop!</p>
<p>Almost 2 years passed since The Sentinel And The Murderer was released. During this time we participated in such great international festivals as Metal Blast Festival (Egypt), Noise Metal Fest (Mongolia) and Rock'N'Iasi festival (Romania), created 4 official videos </p>

<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>Recording a  metal album is not an easy task now - especially for a duo. With every new album we sharpened our skills as composers and musicians - and we believe that the profoundness of music and sound quality also improved  - we do not want any of these characteristics to deteriorate but it depends not only on us but on professionalism of session musicians and, most of all, sound engineer - and professionals have to cost much. So 4 000 EUR is the minimal sum of money we need to record the new album. This is the money to pay for studio time, session musicians, sound engineer and artwork.</p>
<p>In return we offer you the best perks we could think of, which include the digital and physical versions of the album, various merch , some cool pastimes like joining us in Saint Petersburg, and so on.</p>
<p>Note: EVERY PERK INCLUDES SHIPPING TO ANY COUNTRY!</p>
<h3>Budget</h3>
<p>It’s always cool to know where exactly your money goes. So here it comes:</p>
<p>Studio time (90 hours) – 800 USD</p>
<p>Session musicians fees (bass, violin, drums) - 500 USD</p>
<p>Sound engineer’s fees (mixing, mastering) – 2500 USD</p>
<p>Artwork  - 200 USD</p>
<p>Total – 4 000 USD</p>
<h3>What Happens if We Raise Less?</h3>
<p>If we raise less than 4 000 EUR, the album will be made anyway and we will fulfill all our obligations to those who back us up. But of course it will take longer since we will have to do non-musical jobs to earn some of the money ourselves and borrow the rest of it. </p>
<h3>What Happens if We Raise More?</h3>
<p>If we manage to raise more than 4 000 USD, we will add new perks for you! Also there will be possible some stretch goals like a video clip, for example.</p>

<h3>Who we are:</h3>
<p><b>Die Sektor</b> has been around in one form or another for around 10 years now, and over the last few years has been touring the US quite extensively...but now we're about to set off on our most ambitious tour yet.</p>
<p>Over the course of 2 whole months from the start of October 2015 through to the end of November 2015 we will be playing nearly every night in a different city - first as special guests of <b>God Module</b> and after that with <b>Ego Likeness</b>.</p>
<p>We love to play, live to play, of course - but a tour on this epic a scale will be not only physically and mentally strenuous but financially challenging. While of course we will have the opportunity to recover some of the costs involved by selling merch at concerts as we go along, we have first of all to design and manufacture all that merchandise - and then to actually physically get from show to show and pay for somewhere to stay each night we'll be on the road for. All of that has to be paid for in advance - and when we sat down and added it all up, its quite a frightening sum: at minimum around $4,000, to be precise.</p>
<p>So that's where we hope that you - our fans not only in the US but around the world - can help us...and in return we have assembled an array of personal items, services and of course new and exclusive <b>Die Sektor</b> product to offer you in exchange for your support.</p>
<p>No matter where in the world you might be, via this international campaign YOU can help make our US tour the best it can be - and you can get a whole range of amazing rewards for yourself at the same time!</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">To break it down for you, our campaign total of $6,000 is made up of</span><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>October dates with <b>God Module</b>: $2,000 transport and accommodation</li>
<li>November dates with <b>Ego Likeness</b>: $1,500 transport and accommodation</li>
<li>Printing/manufacturing costs of this campaign merch: $2,500</li>
</ul>
<p>We've got a whole load of exciting and exclusive funding options for you to look through, ranging from a colossal 4CD retrospective special edition of last 3 albums (""The Void Trilogy"") to some one-of-a-kind stage props we've used on the road over the years that we'd love to find a new home for.</p>
<p>You picking up any one of the perks we have on offer - as well as in most cases getting you something special and severely limited (if not unique!) - really helps us out.<br/></p>
<p>And remember - Indiegogo is NOT ""like Kickstarter"" in this respect: you can pay for as many of these different things as you like, and then you can come back later to fund us again...and again...and again! As often and as much as you want! And we will be adding more things to this list as the weeks go by...so be sure to stay tuned!</p>
<p>Let's take a look at what's currently on offer:</p>

<h3>Why you should care about this campaign:</h3>Through this campaign, all those of you Stateside already planning on attending one or more shows of the tour itself can get your hands on some extra goodies - but also a whole load of you around the world who won't be able to come can still be involved in a very meaningful way. And we can offer you things via this campaign that would basically be impossible to offer via ""regular retail channels"".</div><div>
<p>And because this campaign is running on a ""flexible funding"" model, even if we don't reach our target we will still get as much money as is raised.</p>
<p>And if we manage to break through that goal, we will use any extra money raised to repair or replace the gear we use live, and to get us to the first date of the tour...because all that could in fact easily set us back another $1,000 on top of the $6,000 we're asking for help with.</p>
</div><div>
<p>And if you help us manage to break through our  $6,000 target, you'll be helping to make everything better for everybody...including of course most importantly YOURSELF. Because if we DO manage to break through, <b>for every additional $500 we reach, we'll be adding FREE UPGRADES </b>like stickers, badges, patches and posters for every single one of you who contributed to the campaign! Jamie at <b>DWA</b> is already losing sleep about what he can come up with next. Why help him rest - he's always saying that he can sleep when he's dead...</p>

</div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help:</h3><p>Bought something here already...or just broke? You can still help us hugely - simply by spreading word of this campaign.</p><p>Tell your friends, tell the friends of your friends, tell the fans of the friends of your friends. Talk about this campaign on Facebook, Twitter, any and all avenues of social media where you hang out. Once, twice, three times...share, repost, reTweet...we'll give you reasons enough with all the weekly updates we'll be posting.</p><p>And even if you don't have any spare cash at the moment, we hope to see a lot of you as we head out on tour this fall - and we can't wait for you to hear our new album for the first time!</p><p></p><p>October and November dates (some more still to be confirmed):</p><p>9/30 SEATTLE / The High Line<br/><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/696546143782872"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/events/696546143782872</a><br/>10/02 CALGARY / Lord Nelson's Pub<br/><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/892436507496692"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/events/892436507496692</a><br/>10/04 PORTLAND / Star Theater<br/><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/1450723405234153/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/events/1450723405234153/</a><br/>10/07 SAN FRANCISCO / Elbo Room<br/><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/421175321423559/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/events/421175321423559/</a><br/>10/09 SAN DIEGO / The Bancroft<br/><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/1585187121741984/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/events/1585187121741984/</a><br/>10/10 LOS ANGELES / Bar Sinister<br/><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/1691113961109681"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/events/1691113961109681</a><br/>10/11 LAS VEGAS / Backstage Bar<br/><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/1428246004170213"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/events/1428246004170213</a><br/>10/12 PHOENIX / ROCK PUB LIVE<br/><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/953043474717314/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/events/953043474717314/</a><br/>10/14 EL PASO / Mesa Music Hall<br/><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/1472139193084454"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/events/1472139193084454</a><br/>10/16 SAN ANTONIO / The Korova<br/><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/1511185782439709/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/events/1511185782439709/</a><br/>10/17 AUSTIN / Elysium<br/>10/18 DALLAS / The Church<br/><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/854122688009498/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/events/854122688009498/</a><br/>10/19 HOUSTON / Numbers<br/>10/20 NEW ORLEANS / Afterburn<br/><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/160513027613892/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/events/160513027613892/</a><br/>10/22 YBOR CITY / The Orpheum<br/><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/1616704418599054/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/events/1616704418599054/</a><br/>10/23 WEST PALM BEACH FL / Respectable Street<br/><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/852690348149147"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/events/852690348149147</a><br/>10/24 JACKSONVILLE / Eclipse<br/>10/26 ATLANTA / The Masquerade (Purgatory)<br/><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/485659181608898"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/events/485659181608898</a></p><p></p><p>10/31 WILMINGTON @ Asylum 13</p><p>11/02 RALEIGH @ Legends</p><p>11/04 RICHMOND @ Fallout</p><p>11/05 NASHVILLE @ The East Room</p><p>11/06 COLUMBUS @ The Shrunken Head</p><p>11/07 ST.

Die Sektor has been around in one form or another for around 10 years now, and over the last few years has been touring the US quite extensively...but now we're about to set off on our most ambitious tour yet.
Over the course of 2 whole months from the start of October 2015 through to the end of November 2015 we will be playing nearly every night in a different city - first as special guests of God Module and after that with Ego Likeness.
We love to play, live to play, of course - but a tour on this epic a scale will be not only physically and mentally strenuous but financially challenging. While of course we will have the opportunity to recover some of the costs involved by selling merch at concerts as we go along, we have first of all to design and manufacture all that merchandise - and then to actually physically get from show to show and pay for somewhere to stay each night we'll be on the road for. All of that has to be paid for in advance - and when we sat down and added it all up, its quite a frightening sum: at minimum around $4,000, to be precise.
So that's where we hope that you - our fans not only in the US but around the world - can help us...and in return we have assembled an array of personal items, services and of course new and exclusive Die Sektor product to offer you in exchange for your support.
No matter where in the world you might be, via this international campaign YOU can help make our US tour the best it can be - and you can get a whole range of amazing rewards for yourself at the same time!

How you can help us, and what you can get in return:
To break it down for you, our campaign total of $6,000 is made up of

October dates with God Module: $2,000 transport and accommodation
November dates with Ego Likeness: $1,500 transport and accommodation
Printing/manufacturing costs of this campaign merch: $2,500

We've got a whole load of exciting and exclusive funding options for you to look through, ranging from a colossal 4CD retrospective special edition of last 3 albums (""The Void Trilogy"") to some one-of-a-kind stage props we've used on the road over the years that we'd love to find a new home for.
You picking up any one of the perks we have on offer - as well as in most cases getting you something special and severely limited (if not unique!) - really helps us out.
And remember - Indiegogo is NOT ""like Kickstarter"" in this respect: you can pay for as many of these different things as you like, and then you can come back later to fund us again...and again...and again! As often and as much as you want! And we will be adding more things to this list as the weeks go by...so be sure to stay tuned!
Let's take a look at what's currently on offer:

<h2><strong>Hello Reader,</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm KHAi, a Singer/Songwriter from Singapore. I've been a regular musician playing at events, bars and on the streets for as long as I can remember. As some of you may know, being a musician is a lot of work and sometimes the amount of effort put into your craft doesn't add up to enough money for you to get by in life. But I've had enough good and bad days to know that the hurdles I've scraped past are all worth it because I genuinely love what I do. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>For years, I've been writing songs which I've kept within the space of my room and now I'm finally ready for you to listen to them. But in order for this to happen, I would require your help to fund my studio recordings. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you've been a listener since the very start of my career, or even if you've just discovered me an hour ago on Spotify, I would like to thank you personally for giving me your time. And to everyone who has given my music a chance, I sincerely thank you and hope that you will continue supporting me as I try to achieve my musical milestones.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>If you have never heard of me or my music before, then let's get acquainted.</strong> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As of right now, I have 2 singles that have been released, titled 'Strange' and 'Small Talk'. If you give them a listen, you'd get the idea of what a finished product of my song recorded in the studio would sound like.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My EP titled ' STRANGE[R] ', which consists of 6 songs, took me many years to craft and write because I had to go through every single emotion that I've been feeling, to finalise what I'd like to convey through this EP. I have recorded most of the songs that I plan to include, with money that I've saved along the years from gigs and busking, and now I'm in the final stages of making it happen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From my perspective, I believe that this EP represents the progression of love. A love that takes shape and form in ways that you can never expect. But, expect a good cry. Expect it to hit you hard. And be ready for some of my intimate thoughts put into words. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>To release the EP, I would need all the help I can get, and any little bit of money would go a long way. I won't lie; it has been quite a struggle trying to fund my music career on top of my living expenses. Most of the money I earn from performing and busking is pumped back into my music. I have had days where I couldn't afford to eat because I needed to save for my recording sessions. And as fun as that is, I would like to believe that there are people out there willing to help me out because they believe in what I do.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>1/3 of the goal - $2000</h2>
<h3>If we hit this goal, we have succeeded in raising funds to complete the production of the EP.</h3>
<ul><li>The funds will be split-up to cover the cost of recording, mixing and mastering the remaining tracks of my EP</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>2/3 of the goal - $4000</h2>
<h3>If we hit this goal, we have succeeded in raising funds to complete the production of the EP + A Music Video. </h3>
<ul>
<li>The funds will be split-up to cover the cost of recording, mixing and mastering the remaining tracks of my EP</li>
<li>Part of the money will go into filming a Music Video</li>
</ul>
<p>I have plans to make a MV for one of my upcoming singles. I have already been in touch with a director and we are finalising the pre-shoot planning. I honestly hope we hit this goal because it's going to be EPIC.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>THE GOAL - $6000</h2>
<h3><strong>If we hit THE goal, we have succeeded in raising funds to complete the production of the EP + A Music Video + An EP Launch Show</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The funds will be split-up to cover the cost of recording, mixing and mastering the remaining tracks of my EP</li>
<li>Part of the money will go into filming a Music Video</li>
<li>The remaining will be set aside for the costs EP Launch show. (Location, Instruments, Musicians etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, I know. It's a little daunting, to be honest, but I'm a dreamer. I've always wanted to have a launch show since I started writing my own songs. It's just the thought of people from all walks of life coming together for one reason that makes it all so special to me.</p>

To release the EP, I would need all the help I can get, and any little bit of money would go a long way. I won't lie; it has been quite a struggle trying to fund my music career on top of my living expenses. Most of the money I earn from performing and busking is pumped back into my music. I have had days where I couldn't afford to eat because I needed to save for my recording sessions. And as fun as that is, I would like to believe that there are people out there willing to help me out because they believe in what I do.
 
1/3 of the goal - $2000
If we hit this goal, we have succeeded in raising funds to complete the production of the EP.
The funds will be split-up to cover the cost of recording, mixing and mastering the remaining tracks of my EP
 
2/3 of the goal - $4000
If we hit this goal, we have succeeded in raising funds to complete the production of the EP + A Music Video. 

The funds will be split-up to cover the cost of recording, mixing and mastering the remaining tracks of my EP
Part of the money will go into filming a Music Video

I have plans to make a MV for one of my upcoming singles. I have already been in touch with a director and we are finalising the pre-shoot planning. I honestly hope we hit this goal because it's going to be EPIC.
 
THE GOAL - $6000
If we hit THE goal, we have succeeded in raising funds to complete the production of the EP + A Music Video + An EP Launch Show

The funds will be split-up to cover the cost of recording, mixing and mastering the remaining tracks of my EP
Part of the money will go into filming a Music Video
The remaining will be set aside for the costs EP Launch show. (Location, Instruments, Musicians etc.)

Yeah, I know. It's a little daunting, to be honest, but I'm a dreamer. I've always wanted to have a launch show since I started writing my own songs. It's just the thought of people from all walks of life coming together for one reason that makes it all so special to me.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p> </p>
<p>В последните две години се сблъскахме с цялата безскрупулна шарения на живота. Всичко това ние смляхме в един албум, който за нас е спасение. Той носи името “Успех” и е единственото, на което си струваше да се посветим.</p>
<p>Искаме да запишем “Успех” в мястото, което даде неговото начало - едно отдалечено село, което неволно стана свидетел на начина, по който преживяваме живота. От моментите на пълна еуфория и всепоглъщаща красота, до острата тъмнина на нощта и безспирния бяг по баирите на съществуването.</p>
<p>“Успех” е до голяма степен всичко, което имаме.<br/><br/><strong>Как да го постигнем?</strong><br/><br/>За да може звукът да бъде такъв, какъвто трябва да е, визуалното представяне на албума да е в синхрон с него, и за да е възможно одушевяването на иначе статични кадри - ние имаме нужда от вашето участие.<br/><br/><strong>Какво ще правим всъщност?</strong><br/><br/>Първо - ще запишем албума в читалище. Една огромна сграда със зала за 400 души в нея. Представете си я - прах по седалките, портрети на незнайни дейци по занемарените коридори и достатъчно литература, за да засрами всеки културен център. Капсула, в която съвременност и мит се бият, от което противоречие пък се ражда безвремието, в което може да се твори. Вън от всички ежедневности и сплетни.</p>
<p>Тъй като читалищата не са предвидени за висококачествени студийни записи, ние трябва да докараме един тон техника (буквално, не преносно), за да можем да направим това, което сме замислили.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567552018/ljxqz87n0k9ogh0othmo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Разбира се, това включва и хората, управляващи тази техника. Сред тях са наши приятели, които са склонни да отделят над 10 дни за реализацията на тази налудничава идея, опитни български звукови инженери и един канадски миксинг инженер, който е отговорен за записите на банди от ранга на Japandroid, Brutus и Comeback Kid. Историята с него е много интересна, защото той живее във Ванкувър, който се намира на другия край на света - над 11 000 км разстояние от нашето читалище, но когато разбра за идеята на албума и къде ще бъде записван, веднага откликна и прояви желание да участва в записите на терен, а не само в собственото си студио Rain City Recorders. Да, и това се случва.</p>
<p>Тези 3000 евро, които сме си поставили като цел, ще отидат частично за продуцирането на албума, като това ще доведе до достигането на възможно най-адекватния за музиката звук, като не се допускат никакви компромиси и дребни (или едри) пречки.</p>
<p>Останалата част от сумата ще бъде насочена към създаване на немузикалния образ на албума. Ще снимаме видеоклип, който допълнително да общува със слушателя относно музиката и да го разведе из света на “Успех”. Ще проведем редица кампании, които да преработят метафората за успеха и да ѝ придадат действителна форма или вид - постери, нестандартни материали, акции. Ще ви разкажем специална игра (невиртуална), която показва различните аспекти на “Успех”. Цялостно - ще създадем един том, към който всеки ще може да прибегне, когато има нужда. А нужда ще има, защото гладът е налице.<br/><br/><strong>Рискове и превенция.</strong><br/><br/>Макар това приключение да е съвсем целенасочено, кроено от повече от година и бленувано от всеки един от нас - то крие своите рискове, които могат да доведат до нереализирането на предвидените дейности.</p>
<p>Кампанията е от типа “всичко или нищо”. Тя е такава, защото дори част от средствата да бъдат събрани, ако не достигнем цялата сума, те няма да бъдат достатъчни, за да се реализира всичко, което сме обещали, по начина, по който трябва да бъде реализирано. Тоест - парите ще бъдат върнати на всички, допринесли за кампанията, а видеоклиповете, визиите, част от музиката и всичко останало - няма да се случат.</p>
<p>Албумът ще получи живот спрямо актуалните ни възможности, като това може да доведе и до неиздаването му. Дори “Успех” с кампанията да не бъде пожънат - то това би била още една усмивка от страна на живота в наша посока. Ние смятаме да контрираме този потенциален проблем, като ангажираме публиката с това, което смятаме за интересно и релевантно спрямо нашето ежедневие и това на албума. Постепенно ще бъдат разкрити доста детайли от тази донякъде обемиста творба. Някои от тях ще бъдат запазени скрити, разбира се.</p>
<p>Очаквайте доста забавни и истински моменти през следващия месец. Тук неща ще се добавят и случват постоянно.<br/><br/><strong>Какво представляват нещата, които предлагаме, и какви са другите начини, по които можете да ни помогнете.</strong><br/><br/>Специалните продукти, които сме решили да предлагаме в тази кампания, са едни от любимите ни неща и не си представяме да има други на техните места, нито пък да изглеждат по друг начин.</p>
<p>Снимките на съществуването са много повече от просто аналогови снимки. Това често са движения преди ключови моменти, различни малки триумфи, които сме забелязвали - било то на младостта, на отчаяните или на някой пиков момент или пък спомени, които са запечатани само на снимка. Тези кадри, които ще имат по едно кратко пожелание на тях, заедно с нашите “безценни” подписи, са малките, ежедневни символи, в които сме сигурни, че много от вас ще се открият.</p>
<p>На тези кадри можете да намерите всичко. Вероятно и повече от очакваното :)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567552052/gf6c53tuse6yynt6reo9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Относно физическите носители на албума и различните им форми - тепърва ще се появява още информация. Разбира се, това е основното, което можем да ви предложим.</p>
<p>Таен концерт - това е идея, която обсъждаме от много години, като най-накрая дойде и подходящ момент за реализацията ѝ. Много често дискутираме как музиката, която слушаме и правим, е по-скоро за интимно преживяване и не предразполага да бъде слушана от големи групи хора. Естествено, това не винаги е така и се дължи по-скоро на нагласа, отколкото на някаква абсолютна истина, но със сигурност такъв аспект музиката ни притежава.</p>
<p>Този концерт ще бъде с ограничен брой хора - 20 души, като цялостното преживяване ще бъде съобразено с естетиката на албума. От избора на място, през посрещачите, до самото концертно изпълнение. Едва ли ще имаме шанса отново да повторим този изключително труден логистично номер, така че това може и да е последната възможност в близко бъдеще за такъв тип преживяване.</p>
<p>Концертът ще се проведе в Пловдив, на определена от нас дата с минимум месец предизвестие, като това ще е и първото изпълнение на новия албум в цялост - повече от месец преди неговото издаване и премиера.</p>
<p>И последно - “Пътят към “Успех”. Това е цялостното преживяване, всеки аспект, цялата история, всеки кадър, всяка минута. Това е достъп до всичко, което “Успех”, а и ТДК, е. В рамките на три дни ще можете да пътувате с нас, да се срещнете с хората, които са оформили албума, да видите камъните, които са понесли товара, който сме превърнали в музика, да се озовете на адски магични места, които не сте знаели, че съществуват, и да чуете истории такива, каквито са, от хората, които са ги преживели.</p>
<p>Всички разходи, които са част от пътуването по “Пътят към Успех”, ще бъдат покрити, а преживяването ще покрие над 1000 км и ще включва едни от най-интересните неща, на които сме се натъквали. Датите и детайлите по Пътя ще бъдат съгласувани между групата и хората, избрали този пакет, така че той да бъде строго индивидуален и специален.</p>
<p>Освен да станете участници в кампанията, вие можете да ни помогнете и като разкажете на своите приятели за нея, споделите я в социалните мрежи или пък напишете url-а ѝ, на някое място, което харесвате или не харесвате (пр. местното ви РУП)</p>
<p>С Успехът вървим хванати за ръка към примирението. С него стигаме до водопада на глада, от който скачаме с всичка сила с главата надолу, с изпънати кокалчета, напълно целеустремени към великото нищо. И това е страхотно.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>English:</strong></p>
<p>In the last couple of years, we encountered the total unscrupulous vividity of life. All this we have melted down into an album, which for us is a certain type of redemption. It bears the name “Успех” (Success) and it’s the only thing worth dedicating to.</p>
<p>We want to record “Успех” at the place which started it all - a remote village, which involuntarily witnessed the way we experience life. From the moments of complete euphoria and all-engulfing beauty, all the way to the sharp darkness of the night and the incessant run over the hills of existence.</p>
<p>“Успех” is more or less all we have.<br/><br/><strong>How will we achieve this?</strong></p>
<p>In order for the sound to be exactly as it should be, the visual representation to go along with it, and in order for an animation of the otherwise static frames to be possible - we need your assistance.</p>
<p><strong>What are we going to do exactly?</strong></p>
<p>First of all, we are going to record the album in a community centre (Читалище). An enormous building with a 400 people capacity hall. Just imagine it for a second - dust on the seats, portraits of unknown workers thrown around the unused corridors and enough literature to put any given cultural hotspot to shame. A capsule in which the modern times are fighting the myths, from which juxtaposition sprouts a certain timelessness - the perfect space for conceiving art. Away from all the everyday chaos.</p>
<p>Our community centres are not designed for high-quality studio recording, which means that we will have to take care of everything personally - bring all the equipment, assemble everything on spot and gather a team which can pull through.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567552101/gms5jqt5fkxtxc2enm2o.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>That’s why we have gathered a few of our friends, who have committed themselves to work with us for 10 days, we have contacted a group of Bulgarian sound engineers, who will conduct the recordings, and an experienced Canadian mixing engineer, who has worked with bands such as Japandroids, Brutus and Comeback kid. The story about his participation is very interesting because he lives in Vancouver, which is located basically on the opposite side of the world, more than 11000 km away from the recording location. But when he found out about the idea we had, he immediately wanted to join us on spot and be part of the recording process. Yes, things like this happen.</p>
<p>So the 3000 euro goal which we have set, will go partly towards the producing of the album, which means we will be able to achieve the most adequate sound for the music we have made, without making any kind of compromise - big or small.</p>
<p>The remainder of the money will be directed towards the non-musical part of the album.</p>
<p>We will shoot a video, which will additionally communicate with the listener about the music and will take them on a journey around the world of “Успех”. We are going to hold several campaigns, which will work through the metaphor of success and will construct its realistic and physical form - posters, non-typical materials, guerillа actions. We are going to devise a special (non-virtual game), which show the different aspects of “Success”</p>
<p>All in all, we are going to create a volume which anyone at any point can turn to when in need. And there is need because there is hunger.</p>
<p><strong>Risks and prevention.</strong></p>
<p>Although this journey is purposeful, being talked about for more than a year and dreamt of by each and every one of us - it still holds its risks which may bring a total and utter failure upon us.</p>
<p>The campaign is with a fixed goal. We did it like that because even if a part of the sum is raised, if we don’t reach the set goal, the funds won’t be enough for us to accomplish everything the way we have promised and the way it should be. In other words - if we don’t reach our goal - all the money will be returned to the people who have contributed, and as for the videos, visuals, part of the music and everything else - well, it will just not happen.</p>
<p>The album will receive life from us according to our current power, which might also lead to its non-release. Even if we don’t achieve “Success” with our campaign, this would just be another smile from life aimed towards us. We intend to counter this potential problem by engaging the audience with what we believe to be interesting and relevant to our everyday life and this of the album. Gradually we will reveal many details of this rather obscured piece of work. Some, of course, will be left hidden.</p>
<p>Expect many fun and real moments in the next month. Things will be added and happen here all the time.</p>
<p><strong>What perks do we offer and what other ways are there for you to help us</strong></p>
<p>The special products, which we have decided to offer in this campaign, are some of our favourite things and we can’t imagine anything else in their place or any other way that they might be presented.</p>
<p>The pictures of our existence are much more than simply analogue photos. They are often movements before key moments, or various little triumphs which we have noticed - whether of youth or desparation - or some peak moment, or a memory, that was imprinted only on film. These pictures, which will include short wishes and our “priceless” signatures, are the little, everyday symbols, and we are sure that many of you will find themselves in them.</p>
<p>You can find anything in these frames. Probably more than expected :)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567552129/whvutuk0mhtfdfa8np1b.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Regarding the physical copies of the album in their different forms - we will yet share more information on that. Naturally, these are the main products that we can offer.</p>
<p>A secret concert - this is an idea which we have discussed for many years and finally the proper moment for its realization has arrived. Oftentimes we talk about how the music which we make - and listen to - is rather meant as an intimate experience and doesn’t function as well when listened to by big crowds of people. Obviously, this is not always the case and it’s rather due to attitude than some absolute truth, but certainly to some extent that aspect of our music is there. </p>
<p>This concert will be very limited in the number of people attending - a maximum of 20 will be let in. The whole experience will be matched to the aesthetics of the album - starting with the choice of location, the people who will greet you and the performance itself. It’s unlikely that we’ll ever have the chance to repeat this logistically very difficult trick, so this will probably be the only time in the near future for an experience of this manner. </p>
<p>The concert will be held in Plovdiv on a date chosen by us which we will communicate to you at least a month in advance. This will be the first live performance of the album in its entirety - more than a month before the official release and premiere. </p>
<p>And finally - the Trip to Success. This is the whole experience, every aspect, the whole story, every frame, every minute. This is access to everything that “Success” - and TDK - is. In three days you will travel with us, meet the people who have shaped the album, see the stones carrying the burden, which we have transformed into music, find yourselves in magical places that you didn’t even know existed and hear the stories as they were from the very people who lived them.</p>
<p>All expenses related to the “Trip to Success” will be covered and the experience will include over 1000km of travel and some of the most interesting things we have stumbled upon. The dates and details of the Trip will be determined individually with the people who have chosen this package so that it can be as individual and customized as possible.</p>
<p>Besides contributing directly to our campaign, you can also help us by telling your friends about it, sharing it on social media or, say, writing the URL someplace you like - or don’t (for example your local police department)</p>
<p>We walk hand in hand with Success towards reconciliation. Together we reach the waterfall of hunger from which we jump  with all our might, heads down, knuckles tensed, completely determined to reach the great nothing.</p>
<p>And this is great.</p>

We want to record “Успех” at the place which started it all - a remote village, which involuntarily witnessed the way we experience life. From the moments of complete euphoria and all-engulfing beauty, all the way to the sharp darkness of the night and the incessant run over the hills of existence.
“Успех” is more or less all we have.How will we achieve this?
In order for the sound to be exactly as it should be, the visual representation to go along with it, and in order for an animation of the otherwise static frames to be possible - we need your assistance.
What are we going to do exactly?
First of all, we are going to record the album in a community centre (Читалище). An enormous building with a 400 people capacity hall. Just imagine it for a second - dust on the seats, portraits of unknown workers thrown around the unused corridors and enough literature to put any given cultural hotspot to shame. A capsule in which the modern times are fighting the myths, from which juxtaposition sprouts a certain timelessness - the perfect space for conceiving art. Away from all the everyday chaos.
Our community centres are not designed for high-quality studio recording, which means that we will have to take care of everything personally - bring all the equipment, assemble everything on spot and gather a team which can pull through.

That’s why we have gathered a few of our friends, who have committed themselves to work with us for 10 days, we have contacted a group of Bulgarian sound engineers, who will conduct the recordings, and an experienced Canadian mixing engineer, who has worked with bands such as Japandroids, Brutus and Comeback kid. The story about his participation is very interesting because he lives in Vancouver, which is located basically on the opposite side of the world, more than 11000 km away from the recording location. But when he found out about the idea we had, he immediately wanted to join us on spot and be part of the recording process. Yes, things like this happen.
So the 3000 euro goal which we have set, will go partly towards the producing of the album, which means we will be able to achieve the most adequate sound for the music we have made, without making any kind of compromise - big or small.
The remainder of the money will be directed towards the non-musical part of the album.
We will shoot a video, which will additionally communicate with the listener about the music and will take them on a journey around the world of “Успех”. We are going to hold several campaigns, which will work through the metaphor of success and will construct its realistic and physical form - posters, non-typical materials, guerillа actions. We are going to devise a special (non-virtual game), which show the different aspects of “Success”
All in all, we are going to create a volume which anyone at any point can turn to when in need. And there is need because there is hunger.
Risks and prevention.
Although this journey is purposeful, being talked about for more than a year and dreamt of by each and every one of us - it still holds its risks which may bring a total and utter failure upon us.
The campaign is with a fixed goal. We did it like that because even if a part of the sum is raised, if we don’t reach the set goal, the funds won’t be enough for us to accomplish everything the way we have promised and the way it should be. In other words - if we don’t reach our goal - all the money will be returned to the people who have contributed, and as for the videos, visuals, part of the music and everything else - well, it will just not happen.
The album will receive life from us according to our current power, which might also lead to its non-release. Even if we don’t achieve “Success” with our campaign, this would just be another smile from life aimed towards us. We intend to counter this potential problem by engaging the audience with what we believe to be interesting and relevant to our everyday life and this of the album. Gradually we will reveal many details of this rather obscured piece of work. Some, of course, will be left hidden.
Expect many fun and real moments in the next month. Things will be added and happen here all the time.
What perks do we offer and what other ways are there for you to help us
The special products, which we have decided to offer in this campaign, are some of our favourite things and we can’t imagine anything else in their place or any other way that they might be presented.
The pictures of our existence are much more than simply analogue photos. They are often movements before key moments, or various little triumphs which we have noticed - whether of youth or desparation - or some peak moment, or a memory, that was imprinted only on film. These pictures, which will include short wishes and our “priceless” signatures, are the little, everyday symbols, and we are sure that many of you will find themselves in them.
You can find anything in these frames. Probably more than expected :)

Regarding the physical copies of the album in their different forms - we will yet share more information on that. Naturally, these are the main products that we can offer.
A secret concert - this is an idea which we have discussed for many years and finally the proper moment for its realization has arrived. Oftentimes we talk about how the music which we make - and listen to - is rather meant as an intimate experience and doesn’t function as well when listened to by big crowds of people. Obviously, this is not always the case and it’s rather due to attitude than some absolute truth, but certainly to some extent that aspect of our music is there. 
This concert will be very limited in the number of people attending - a maximum of 20 will be let in. The whole experience will be matched to the aesthetics of the album - starting with the choice of location, the people who will greet you and the performance itself. It’s unlikely that we’ll ever have the chance to repeat this logistically very difficult trick, so this will probably be the only time in the near future for an experience of this manner. 
The concert will be held in Plovdiv on a date chosen by us which we will communicate to you at least a month in advance. This will be the first live performance of the album in its entirety - more than a month before the official release and premiere. 
And finally - the Trip to Success. This is the whole experience, every aspect, the whole story, every frame, every minute. This is access to everything that “Success” - and TDK - is. In three days you will travel with us, meet the people who have shaped the album, see the stones carrying the burden, which we have transformed into music, find yourselves in magical places that you didn’t even know existed and hear the stories as they were from the very people who lived them.
All expenses related to the “Trip to Success” will be covered and the experience will include over 1000km of travel and some of the most interesting things we have stumbled upon. The dates and details of the Trip will be determined individually with the people who have chosen this package so that it can be as individual and customized as possible.
Besides contributing directly to our campaign, you can also help us by telling your friends about it, sharing it on social media or, say, writing the URL someplace you like - or don’t (for example your local police department)
We walk hand in hand with Success towards reconciliation. Together we reach the waterfall of hunger from which we jump  with all our might, heads down, knuckles tensed, completely determined to reach the great nothing.
And this is great.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign
