<p>My name is Gunnar Engblom. I am a Swedish biologist who arranges birdwatching tours in Peru since 1998 with my company Kolibri Expeditions. I have been involved in numerous projects involving threatened birds, and even though I run a bird tour company I have always looked for ways in which birding tourism can empower conservation. Getting myself involved with my company to raise funds for the local bird guide Cesar Zevallos to collect breeding data of the Junin Grebe is a fantastic way of both empowering local people as well as channeling the concerns of birdwatchers and conservationists worldwide.</p>
<p><b>Critically Endangered Junin Grebe</b> may go extinct. Without continuous monitoring of the breeding success, it may happen faster than we can detect it. </p>The Junin Grebe has an extremely small range and population. It is the most threatened bird in Peru. Yet there is no regular monitoring that can give reliable data of changes of the population.  By introducing simple monitoring of the breeding success over a couple of months to a year, we shall show that this methodology gives far more reliable data to monitor any change in the population than the yearly/bi-yearly total counts of birds in the lake which are carried out using small rocky boats.  <p></p>
<p>The total population counts have many sources of discrepancies that makes it impossible to compare data from one year to another, such as:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>difficulty of separating Junin and Silvery Grebe in the field, </li>
<li>observer experience, </li>
<li>birds being wary not allowing getting close enough for certain identification, </li>
<li>birds diving creating double counts, </li>
<li>birds staying within the massive reed areas not allowing to be counted, </li>
<li>birds moving from one survey quadrant to another creating double counts or omit to be counted.  </li>
</ul>As things are now, rapid changes in the population numbers could go undetected, and may be discovered when it is too late. <div>
<h3>Long Summary</h3>
<p>There were 23 species of grebes known in the world, but three of these have gone extinct very recently - Colombian Grebe 1977, Atitlán Grebe in Guatemala 1989, and Alaotra Grebe of Madagascar 2010. All were very restricted in range and both Atitlán and Alaotra Grebes were flightless. The same is true for the Junin Grebe in Central Peru and with its very small population of only 200-350 birds it is the most threatened bird in Peru. <br/>It only lives on the Junin Lake and due to the isolation in Pleistocene glacial times it evolved losing the ability of flight. Conditions of the lake stayed more or less the same until mining started 1955 and the regulation of the water level for a hydroelectric power plant below on the Mantaro river. </p>
<p>Morrison visited the lake in January-May in 1938, before any alterations, and found the Junin Grebe extremely abundant. Still in 1961 Frank Gill saw several hundreds of birds in the southern end of the lake, suggesting that well over 1000 birds inhabited the lake at this time. </p>
<p>?The recent changes of its habitat with pollution from mining, served waters from nearby communities, agriculture and livestock, as well as abrupt changes in water levels are probably the main reasons for the reduction in numbers. Possibly these factors have changed the composition of food items available. A recent threat include presence of large trout in the lake. <br/><br/>??Practically all recent census since 1977 have come up with similar numbers of 200-350 birds in the whole lake. However, the methodology used, the skills and experience of the observers to separate Junin Grebe from the similar shorter-billed Silvery Grebe, the birds tendency to frequently dive when a boat is approaching, the possibility that a part of the population is within the inaccessible reed area and the limited range of hand-held binoculars, make numbers from year to year extremely difficult to compare.  </p>
<p>The most recent census counted 236 birds (Rolando Tito, SERNANP, pers com). A previous count one year earlier had 315 birds (Alan Chamorro, ECOAN, pers com). So either, there is a worrying 25% decrease of the population in one year, or the methodology for counting the whole population is not very exact. <br/><br/></p>
<p>Regardless, drastic real changes in the numbers are not going to be detected until it is too late. A complimentary census is needed to look at changes in the population dynamics and the breeding success. This is what we aim to do with this project.</p>
<h3>Methodology.</h3>
<p>Cesar Zevallos - a well known local bird guide from Ondores, Junin, has taken part in numerous census studies in the past and knows the Junin Grebe very well. The idea is that Cesar gets out to the reed edge on a daily basis. First to locate the nests. Last year Cesar found around 30 nests and a good number to get some sort of tendency if they were to monitored over an extended period. Notes will be taken on GPS location of each nest, how many young are reared and if any of the nests are abandoned.</p>
<p>Cesar's monthly salary when working with other projects in the region has been US$260/month. I asked Cesar whether he would be interested in collecting the data for the project if I could raise the $300 per month and he was more than pleased to confirm. It makes me wonder why no one has already commenced to collect the necessary data this way. </p>
<p>It is not easy field work and this could be a reason. Cesar uses a aluminum one person homemade kayak to get to the reed edge. Over some stretches he will have to carry it over the floating vegetation. There are sink holes here and there, so he will in most circumstances get wet. The rainy season has started which also makes the work hard, wet and cold. And the altitude is 4100 meters above sea level.  Yet, $300/month is an important addition to the family household of Cesar's family with wife and two kids at 6 and 9.  Only 10 US$ from 30 people assures one month of expense to run the project.</p>
</div>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need minimum of 3 months of data, thus about $1000 for the first phase, plus telescope, tripod and digital camera. Thus, $3000 is set as our minimum goal.  But both to find out more in detail about the threats to grebes and to get the overview picture we should try to expand the project over a year to include.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Point counts from the reed edge on daily basis to monitor population dynamics and population changes. These point count studies can be reproduced with accuracy in future years. </li>
<li>Toxicology and stomach content studies of dead birds found. </li>
<li>Sampling of food availability different times of year with a <p>homemade Minnow trap made from a soda bottle will give some immediate answers. </p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FfUb1yg7Hadk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DfUb1yg7Hadk%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FfUb1yg7Hadk%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<div>Here is a cost breakdown for the whole year.<p></p>
<p>$3600 - salary to Cesar. <br/>$1000 - telescope<br/>$400 - tripod<br/>$500 - point and shoot camera.</p>
<p>So all in all the funds needed for a full year is $5500. But we shall start with only $3000 in funds regardless of how much can be raised. </p>
<p>If we raise more money the funds will be carried into 2017 and continue the project. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We believe that the pledge for the Junin Grebe is so powerful, that anyone would want to donate at least 1 US$ and spread the word to their friends.  If you are a birdwatcher and interested in birding in Peru, you should definitely have a look at the perks in the $100-1000 range. All these will give you birdwatching perks in Peru with a value which actually surpasses the total of the amount donated. It is a WIN-WIN-WIN-WIN situation. <br/></p>
<ul>
<li>You can't lose.  You save money, <br/>
</li>
<li>Kolibri Expeditions gets a client, <br/>
</li>
<li>Cesar Zevallos gets a monthly salary <br/>
</li>
<li>JUNIN GREBE GETS A SURVEY METHODOLOGY THAT WILL SHOW TRUE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE POPULATION BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. <br/>
</li>
</ul>Everyone is a winner!
<br/><br/><p>Even if we do not reach our goals with this campaign, it shall not stop us to collect data for at least a couple of months.  </p>
</div>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact of the Junin Grebe project.</h3>
<p>By showing that reliable population data can be collected by doing a survey of breeding success and point counts from fixed points, it will highlight the importance of creating better access to the lake reed edge. As for now, any birder wanting to see the Grebe needs to hire a motor boat and spend minimum of over three hours on the lake. For the current surveys that includes counting all the birds on the open water it is extremely manpower demanding. BUT WHAT IF?</p>
<p>What if there was a boardwalk to the reed edge? About 2 km of boardwalk would be needed. Check this boardwalk of similar length from Point Pelee, in Canada. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459800126/Point_Pelee_boardwalk_nx5bg3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>This would not be inexpensive and is out of the scope of what our modest efforts of fundraising can achieve. But if it is 100% clear that the best data can be collected from fixed points, then I am sure that enough money could be raised by larger funding bodies such as the Wildfowl and Wetland Trust in the UK, Nature Conservancy of the US or Birdlife International perhaps through the British Birdfair. At the end of the board walk at the reed edge one could build a floating observation tower similar to this construction I saw in the Brazilian Pantanal. <br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459800839/Floating_observation_tower_in_Pantanal_Brazil._Photo._Gunnar_Engblom_MG_3581-001_naethj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Such a tower can be towed or moved with an engine to different fixed points in the lake, where we already know there are big concentrations of grebes in the non-breeding season. Over a couple of days at various points, one could get a replicable methodology for counting birds in the open water. Such data could be collected several times per year for a small cost in both funds as well as manpower.  <br/><br/>The boardwalk would also dynamize ecotourism in a unprecedented way in Junin. The Junin lake is incredibly impressive with massive number of birds, but the access is limited. The lack of infrastructure and the extreme altitude makes most ecotourists stay away.  The boardwalk would highlight the importance of ecotourism to the lake. It would be managed by SERNANP and the voluntary park guards of the local community which would get an income from the use of the boardwalk. For birders it would make less impact than the current motorized boats and it would promote local ecotourism among Peruvians. Afterall, Junin lake is only 4 hours from Lima. Lima has 9 million inhabitants and ecotourism, especially bird photography, is getting very popular. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Whenever an expat gringo tries to do something positive in Peru (and I presume elsewhere in South America the situation is much the same), we may get reactions that question our sincerity and our motives. When announcing this project I got immediately got such reactions, from very few, but still loud opponents.  Especially local conservation organizations will question your motives and also indirectly hint that conservation funds does not go to true conservation.  It is true however, that we will use the goodwill of doing conservation and perhaps sell a few more birding trips, just as a conservation organizations would get into building lodges in conservation areas to capture funds from birders.  Is there really any difference?<br/><br/>So let's go through the type of critique that is possible. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<i>The project will deviate important conservation funds.  </i>Not true. There are no conservation funds involved in this project. The money, apart from the small amount donation categories, stem from a part of the price that birdwatchers would spend for a birding tour. </li>
<li>
<i>Commercial companies should not try to do conservation</i>. We are just collecting data which will be shared openly with other institutions such as SERNANP (the Peruvian State Conservation Body) and Birdlife International.  We also have plans to get a student to use analyze the data for a thesis.  <br/>
</li>
<li>
<i>Commercial companies are only interested in making money and have no true interest in conservation. This is just a commercial sales gimmick. </i>While I certainly hope that our interest in saving the Junin Grebe would also be commercially viable giving us more clients in the long run, I still believe the main thing is that we are actually doing SOMETHING. Just stating that someone ought to be doing something, when one can do something oneself is not very satisfactory. We have a unique position with big following on Social Media to be able to raise the money for that SOMETHING that needs to be done. It is our commitment with Cesar Zevallos and his family, and with the Junin Grebe.  </li>
<li>
<i>By starting this project you are criticizing the previous work done by other conservation organizations.  </i>We don't see it like that. This data will be supplemental to previous data. Previous conservation work in the Junin area has been very successful in making the local population more aware and have also monitored the water-levels and the pollution, as well as been in constant negotiation about the maximum/minimum water-levels and the amount of pollution. In the future in such negotiations, it shall be vital to know to what extent pollution or water level fluctuations are the problem. </li>
</ol>
<div>We shall remain very open about the project and look forward to work with the local conservation NGO:s for a synergistic maximum effect to save the Junin Grebe from extinction. <p></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you cannot support with even ONE DOLLAR, you can still support the project by making it better known among your friends. Use the sharing tools on Indiegogo. Also consider supporting Cesar directly by using his services as a guide in the Junin area. You may also help spreading the word about Kolibri Expeditions as a bird tour operator with social and environmental conscience. <br/><br/>Furthermore, if you are Peruvian, you may join our Junin outings at a special price that cover our costs, to experience the Junin Grebe first hand. We hope you then help to spread the project to your friends abroad and encourage them to donate.  </p>

Finca Katanga (Katanga farm) is a family
project, our main goal is
to provide agricultural land and livestock production using an
agosilvopastpralism-based system. Located at 650
mamsl in the municipality of San Luis, Tolima, Colombia; the farm is
categorised as a tropical dry forest. Our
principles aim to encourage sustainability in agricultural and livestock
activities, outlining methods that reduce negative impacts on the social and
natural environments, while promoting the positive results of of a sustainable
farming system.2015 was one of the
warmest year on record and this has caused negative repercussions throughout the region.The farm and its
inhabitants have suffered the consequences of El Niño : drought, forest fires, mosquito -related diseases (zika , chikungunya , dengue).
We realized the need to act quickly to preserve not only our investment and
family project but the future of our land; and as a result of this we develop the
Iwana project in honour of one of the tenants (Iwana is the Taino name for Iguana). We identified three main areas of the
farm presenting a certain degree of vulnerability to soil erosion, and one area
where establishing a connection between the 20-ha secondary forest and a small
legume-tree wood would help some animal species (birds, iguanas, and many more) by enlarging their habitat.  We decided that
planting native trees would be the best solution.

Trees wouldn’t only reduce and prevent
soil erosion or connect woody areas of the farm, they would also bring many
other ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, temperature reduction of
the soil surface, housing supply for many birds and other animals, and many
more!The project
We identify 4 zones to plant trees; it
represents a total of 11’598 m2.
We plan to plant a total of 590 trees from different species (Algarrobo, Balso, Yarumo, Guadua, Iguá, Caracolí) 
We need :
- 
1708 m of electric wire for electric
fences
- 
170.8 studs
- 
345 kg of compost
-

You will be able to protect your mirrors, valuable artwork in the same way professional movers do.</div><div>...<u>Moving Company Owners</u> - This new system will create better cash retention in your company. Ballooning costs for ordering multiple third-party crates for customer moves can be scaled way back. Fragile and marginally fragile items can be crated, using reusable crating, thereby reducing liability claims without increasing these third-party cash drains. Your company keeps control of schedules (see driver's advantages).</div><div>...<u>Packing Professionals</u> - This new system allows you to control your own workflow. No need to rely on the schedules of third-party crating companies. If your contract calls for you to pay for crating (to third-parties), reusable crating keeps that revenue in your pocket. Reusable crating is also assembled around a mirror carton-packed item in about 20 minutes, as opposed to the 40-50 minute average time of a custom wood crate.</div><div>...<u>Independent Drivers</u> - This new system keeps you on the go. How many times during the loading process do items appear from under beds or behind heavy furniture that should be crated? Scheduling a third-party crater to return to the jobsite keeps you sitting at the curb. Or, assuming the liability of accepting an uncrated item is financially dangerous. Having kits on your truck gives you the freedom to crate on-the-fly - and keep you on the road.</div><div>...<u>Shippers of High-Grade Artwork</u> - This new system gives you a secure, easy-to-use method of protecting valuable art pieces during transport and storage. It is great value for artists who create and sell their own work to pass this up-scale crate on to their customers. It is convenient value for private or corporate art owners who move their collection in regular intervals.</div><div>...<u>Consumers of Professional Moving Services </u>- This new system assures you that your moving professionals will be free to crate more of your precious items in an extremely more cost-effective way. Contractual limits are placed on cost outlays, in many cases, forcing the surveyor and contractors to make critical choices on the crates they order for your move. More of your personal items will receive the protection and care they (and you) deserve.</div><div>...<u>Manufacturers of Custom Sub-Assemblies</u> - This new system can give you an alternative to one-time-use crating systems that cost money to build, money to disassembly, and are unlikely to be reused because of size, shape, or damage. If you regularly ship sub-assemblies to assembly destination plants, this system can save you time, money, and dreadful waste.</div><ol>
</ol><h3></h3><h3>Introducing the Aalaniel Products</h3><p><a href=""http://www.aalaniel.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>http://www.aalaniel.com</u></a> </p><p>The basic Aalaniel Crating model is called the Evergreen; you can see it assembled in this CAD rendering. The Blue Spruce model contains longer extension pieces that replace the parts of the frame between the center member (the part with our logo on it) and the corner unit. Each wall of the frame can be extended out to 84"" with the Blue Spruce extensions. The Yellow Pine model contains more cross member assemblies to brace larger frame sizes (if needed).</p><p>The Aalaniel Crating system is designed as a 2-D crating system, specifically any X/Y dimension between 28"" and 84"" while always being 4"" thick. These sizes fit the majority of custom built wood frames for household moving (and the majority for high-end artwork shipping requirements.</p><p>To accommodate crating needs that exceed the 4"" standard width, the Aalaniel system will have available, in the near future, connector elements that will join 2 or more Aalaniel crates together - side-by-side. This gives consumers and professionals alike the ability to crate items with a re-usable, sustainable crating system.

<b>MADE IN THE USA!</b> We have 24 separate parts that we will build tooling to mold and manufacture the crating system and their traveling cases. All the molding and assembly will take place right here in the USA - specifically in Nampa, Idaho.</li>
<li>
<b>QUALITY QUOTING.</b> Injection molds are expensive and we have worked with our vendor(s) getting this system quoted 6 ways to Tuesday (old Minnesota saying). We are confident of the quality we expect to receive. </li>
<li>
<b>WHO GETS ONE?</b> The finished kits will be expensive in terms of retailing them to the general public, but they will eventually be available to anyone and everyone. We expect that our base model kit will retail for around $300 and almost $400 with a fitted case. We would like all our backers to get an Aalaniel Crating kit, but we have to be careful not to recreate supply errors of the recent past - crowd funded projects that could not afford to produce enough to get the company off the ground and fulfill promises to their backers.</li>
<li>
<b>OUR BACKER'S MONEY AND SUCCESS.</b> We are dedicated to get the company off the ground, through the starting gate, and running down the track of growing success. We encourage our backers to share and refer others to this campaign to avoid delays in accomplishing all of these things. Indiegogo asks us to describe where the funds will go if we do not make our goal...well honestly, right back here again. We will start another crowd funding campaign (with marketing adjustments and focus pivots) and combine all funds raised until we do make our tooling goal.</li>

It is great value for artists who create and sell their own work to pass this up-scale crate on to their customers. It is convenient value for private or corporate art owners who move their collection in regular intervals....Consumers of Professional Moving Services - This new system assures you that your moving professionals will be free to crate more of your precious items in an extremely more cost-effective way. Contractual limits are placed on cost outlays, in many cases, forcing the surveyor and contractors to make critical choices on the crates they order for your move. More of your personal items will receive the protection and care they (and you) deserve....Manufacturers of Custom Sub-Assemblies - This new system can give you an alternative to one-time-use crating systems that cost money to build, money to disassembly, and are unlikely to be reused because of size, shape, or damage. If you regularly ship sub-assemblies to assembly destination plants, this system can save you time, money, and dreadful waste.
Introducing the Aalaniel Productshttp://www.aalaniel.com The basic Aalaniel Crating model is called the Evergreen; you can see it assembled in this CAD rendering. The Blue Spruce model contains longer extension pieces that replace the parts of the frame between the center member (the part with our logo on it) and the corner unit. Each wall of the frame can be extended out to 84"" with the Blue Spruce extensions. The Yellow Pine model contains more cross member assemblies to brace larger frame sizes (if needed).The Aalaniel Crating system is designed as a 2-D crating system, specifically any X/Y dimension between 28"" and 84"" while always being 4"" thick. These sizes fit the majority of custom built wood frames for household moving (and the majority for high-end artwork shipping requirements.To accommodate crating needs that exceed the 4"" standard width, the Aalaniel system will have available, in the near future, connector elements that will join 2 or more Aalaniel crates together - side-by-side. This gives consumers and professionals alike the ability to crate items with a re-usable, sustainable crating system.

Future Frame to Frame Link Section:What We Need to Roll This Ball Here's how our early costs break down for our backers in more detail:  
MADE IN THE USA! We have 24 separate parts that we will build tooling to mold and manufacture the crating system and their traveling cases. All the molding and assembly will take place right here in the USA - specifically in Nampa, Idaho.

QUALITY QUOTING. Injection molds are expensive and we have worked with our vendor(s) getting this system quoted 6 ways to Tuesday (old Minnesota saying). We are confident of the quality we expect to receive. 

WHO GETS ONE? The finished kits will be expensive in terms of retailing them to the general public, but they will eventually be available to anyone and everyone. We expect that our base model kit will retail for around $300 and almost $400 with a fitted case. We would like all our backers to get an Aalaniel Crating kit, but we have to be careful not to recreate supply errors of the recent past - crowd funded projects that could not afford to produce enough to get the company off the ground and fulfill promises to their backers.

OUR BACKER'S MONEY AND SUCCESS. We are dedicated to get the company off the ground, through the starting gate, and running down the track of growing success. We encourage our backers to share and refer others to this campaign to avoid delays in accomplishing all of these things. Indiegogo asks us to describe where the funds will go if we do not make our goal...well honestly, right back here again. We will start another crowd funding campaign (with marketing adjustments and focus pivots) and combine all funds raised until we do make our tooling goal.

<h3>Starting with the soil</h3>
<p>In Massachusetts, we currently EXPORT a lot of our garbage. What a waste! Close to capacity, <strong>our landfills are set to close by 2021</strong>.</p>
<p>In Franklin County, we also have a <strong>high recidivism rate</strong>, which means that nearly half the people who come out of jail end up back there—often because of a lack of access to meaningful, engaging work and other forms of social supports that can be invisible to those who already have them.</p>
<p>At the Compost Co-operative, we want to live in a world where food scraps—and humans—are considered precious, not disposable.</p>
<p><strong>We believe in compost as a powerful agent of social change</strong>.</p>
<p>The Compost Co-op is a collective effort to interrupt the process of repeated incarceration, with all its damage to individuals, families, and communities. We offer commercial and residential food scraps pickup services in Greenfield, MA, partnering with local restaurants, cooperative businesses, and western Massachusetts' largest composting facility, Martin's Farm. </p>
<p><strong>Help us build a just and sustainable business for people coming out of jail, with your generous gift of any amount you can afford. Together we can</strong> <strong>redefine public safety and replenish the soil</strong>.</p>
<p>This worker-owned business rises out of conversations over a number of years between incarcerated people, educators, and local cooperatives and composting experts about what we could do at a local level to deal with the problems we face.</p>
<p>Now our dream is becoming a reality, with our first commercial customers. We will be starting residential food scraps pickups by bicycle in Greenfield later this year. Our goal is to have five part-time worker owners by 2020. To provide service for our commercial customers and generate a sustainable revenue stream, we need a reliable, used truck. We've been borrowing one, and now we're ready to take the plunge and purchase our own.</p>
<p><strong>Help us</strong> <strong>divert up to 100 tons per year of compostable waste from the landfill </strong>as we expand our business.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why does our project deserve your support?</h3>
<p>Having paid our debt to society, people coming out of jail and prison often have nothing. Employers hesitate to hire people with felony convictions. It's hard to find work, especially that pays a living wage. This often pushes people back to old ways of surviving and increases the likelihood of getting caught in the system. We decided to do something about that destructive cycle—by building our own business!</p>
<p>We began with a simple observation: our town doesn't divert residential compostable waste. And we thought, maybe there is a place for us. So we took an economic model for stability in hard times—the worker-owned cooperative—and mixed in our passion for justice, community spirit, and the relationships we have built over years. That's how the Compost Co-operative, an innovative project to create jobs and replenish the soil, came to be. We've started with commercial customers, and plan to begin residential curbside pickups later this year in Greenfield—by bicycle.</p>
<p>At the Compost Co-op we provide a much-needed service, help regenerate topsoil, and create living-wage employment for people who face legalized discrimination and social stigma. We understand the urgent need for all municipalities to divert compostable waste from landfills—and believe that everyone has the potential to rebuild their life through connecting with others.</p>
<p>Until now, we've been hauling with a borrowed truck. After much planning and budgeting, we're ready to purchase our own used vehicle! We also need a lift gate, buckets, safety equipment, and insurance. <strong>With a reliable truck, we will be able to take on more customers and expand our business to include two more worker owners this year. </strong></p>
<p>Launching without a large debt hanging over our worker owners will make all the difference to the success of our business. We know this is possible. Our existing customers are valued investors in the community. Our supporters agree that we all deserve a second, third, and even fourth chance—to have access to stability, education, housing, healthcare, and opportunity to address and repair the harms we have caused and to heal from those we have experienced.</p>
<p>By supporting the Compost Co-op, you are participating in a unique effort to address a large social problem in a local and sustainable way. You can feel proud about being part of this project to bring about social change, one bucketful of food scraps at a time.</p>
<p><strong><i>If we are not able to reach our goal of $10,000 in this campaign, all the funds we raise will go towards the purchase of our truck.</i></strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The impact of your gift</h3>
<p>It costs more than $50,000 per year to incarcerate someone in Massachusetts. The financial and emotional costs—including for loved ones, especially children of incarcerated parents—extend down the generations. We believe it is unsound fiscal policy to spend that kind of money on incarceration rather than education, economic development, housing, and healthcare.</p>
<p>Each person coming out of jail or prison faces different challenges, from reuniting with family and friends to adjusting to the requirements of probation or parole to lack of access to affordable housing and nourishing food. All of our worker owners will be paid to go through our apprenticeship program, which will prepare them for full ownership and democratic control of the business. Leadership, public speaking, business skills, wellness: these are all skills we cultivate as we replenish the soil.</p>
<p>The Compost Co-op represents a grassroots effort to interrupt the revolving door of incarceration by creating living-wage jobs that people <i>own</i>.</p>
<p><strong>Will owning a business keep someone out of jail? Maybe. Is $10,000 better spent on building a business than incarcerating someone? We think so—and hope you will, too.</strong></p>
<p>The Compost Co-op benefits from the expertise of its developers in many areas: composting, cooperative business development, post-incarceration/reentry, legislation at the state level, media, and storytelling. We have raised awareness in our community about our country's over-reliance on punishment. We believe that the concept of public safety has to include everyone. We have gained the support and trust of local cooperatives and other businesses and institutions in Greenfield and look forward to sharing our progress with others.

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; challenges</h3>
<p>Like the tortoise, we move slowly and steadily. It is difficult to capitalize a business with little or no money. It is difficult to rebuild your life after being incarcerated. <strong>We are realists and dreamers. </strong>Our advisors, many of whom have experienced incarceration, include educators, poets, composting experts, cooperative business owners, and bicycle-powered waste haulers (Pedal People in Northampton, MA, another worker-owned cooperative). Our first worker owner helped develop the business plan while incarcerated.</p>
<p>After 3 years of planning and development, we are finally rolling. We are humbled by the tremendous support we have received from people and institutions in our community, and from cooperatives all over. Yes, there are challenges. Your support gives us the energy to continue despite the odds.</p>

Admittedly, “saving the planet” is a pretty overwhelming goal. So, we looked to the best information source available for guidance, planet earth! Trees are the ultimate carbon solution, turning tons of co2 into the oxygen that we need. Every day that consumers, well, consume, the planet suffers tremendously.</p><p> </p><p>As a result, we realized that a program to help the planet required individuals coming together to address the current consumption situation head on. So we created a subscription based, carbon accountability plan that plants trees on our subscribers’ behalf. Through Forest Founders, individuals will be able to plant enough trees to negate the average American’s carbon footprint.</p><h3>

The Forest Founders app will give businesses the opportunity to plant trees on their consumers’ behalf through an environmentally conscientious marketing program. Anyone who downloads the free Forest Founders app will be able to find participating businesses, track the trees they redeem, collect points, and understand how their consumer behavior can change the planet.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Take Matters into Your Own Hands</strong></h3><p> </p><p>It’s true, what Bill Nye said.

Tree planting is one of the single best ways available to help negate our carbon footprint on this earth. We plant trees, we want to build an app, and we need your help.</p></div>","Forest Founders meets one necessary and universal goal: to help the current state of our planet. Admittedly, “saving the planet” is a pretty overwhelming goal. So, we looked to the best information source available for guidance, planet earth! Trees are the ultimate carbon solution, turning tons of co2 into the oxygen that we need. Every day that consumers, well, consume, the planet suffers tremendously. As a result, we realized that a program to help the planet required individuals coming together to address the current consumption situation head on. So we created a subscription based, carbon accountability plan that plants trees on our subscribers’ behalf. Through Forest Founders, individuals will be able to plant enough trees to negate the average American’s carbon footprint.
 This campaign is raising funds to bring the Carbon Accountability Plan to life through the creation of a mobile app that, like YouTube, will use marketing to provide a free service to our members. The Forest Founders app will give businesses the opportunity to plant trees on their consumers’ behalf through an environmentally conscientious marketing program. Anyone who downloads the free Forest Founders app will be able to find participating businesses, track the trees they redeem, collect points, and understand how their consumer behavior can change the planet. Take Matters into Your Own Hands It’s true, what Bill Nye said. The planet is on f***ing fire! Forests are burning to the ground, global temperatures are rising, and natural disasters claim endless habitats and homes. We all stand to lose if we do not address our carbon crisis. By subscribing to our Carbon Accountability Plan, you are able to take matters into your own hands and finally become a part of the solution.   We are inspired and humbled by: 
Leonardo Dicaprio and Matt Damon who use their popularity to champion our cause.
Scott Harrison who leads by example and shows us the difference one person can make. 
Elon Musk who stands up against incredible odds and was willing to sacrifice everything to allow us a better future (and our founder’s personal hero, Jim Chanos need not subscribe...)
Bill Nye and Captain Planet for inspiring the generation that will take charge in this fight.
Greta Thunberg who proves that even the smallest voices can be incredibly powerful.
Our children and future generations that bring the reality of our current situation into shockingly clear focus. Without focused change now there might not be a future for them.
Our Mother Earth whose natural beauty and generosity we take for granted daily.
And every single person who takes the time to read and understand what we are trying to accomplish and becomes a member or subscriber.
 Signing up brings Forest Founders closer to our goals. As our membership grows it will be impossible to ignore us. Even if you don’t subscribe with us and pay monthly to negate your carbon footprint, take the first step of becoming a member so we can update you on our progress. Share us with your friends and family to allow us to build our network so when our app is ready we have a large pool of members to force businesses to take us seriously. The more support we have the quicker it will be to convince businesses to rally to our cause.  Without a user base businesses might not feel compelled to do the right thing and plant trees with us. We need to show them that our consumer power is strong and we demand they take the carbon footprint they generate to create profits seriously. This will enable us to reward the businesses that do, and hopefully convince the ones that don’t to change their minds over time. Do you see our vision? Become a member today and sign up with us at forestfounders.org. Channel your inner Gandhi and “Be the change that you wish to see in the world.” How it Works   The Carbon Accountability Plan is a subscription based model that plants trees and rewards points to Forest Founders members. Using the Forest Founders member dashboard, subscribers can: 
Use points for Forest Founders merchandise
Spend points on planting extra trees

 Our members are encouraged to share our program! Any referral will result in bonus points and extra trees planted. Your personal profile page will keep track of the trees you plant, manage your rewards points, and create an easy way to invite friends and share our program online.  ""The best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago, the second best time is now!""- Chinese Proverb Forest Founders for Businesses With the development of the Forest Founders App, we will be able to develop more solutions for users to help the planet using the devices in their pockets. In order for this to work we need to engage businesses to lead the charge. Climate change isn’t a result of just one person’s commute to work. It’s more than that, and if we can get businesses on board to join our mission, we can maximize our efforts to the fullest.  Businesses that join us can manage promotions in a way that both help the planet and also brings in new, unique customers who share their values. Through the Forest Founders app, businesses will be able to get in front of the sustainably conscientious audience they’ve been looking for. Most importantly, consumers know they’re purchasing products or services from a business that cares about our planet, and takes action to be carbon accountable. The app will interact with our website’s member profile page and points and progress will be tracked.  Here are some examples of business promotions that can be run through the app: 
Restaurants can promote a “Green Meal of The Day” that plants trees when purchased.
Fitness gyms can promote a “Go Green and Get Fit” campaign that plants a tree for  members on a monthly basis.
Retail stores can plant trees for members who pick up in-store to reduce shipping needs while also advertising in store promotions. “Sustainable Saturday, 10% off and plant one tree for all in-store purchases”.
 The Forest Founders app will use geo-location, QR codes, and direct email tree invites to provide customer satisfaction and security. Elegant and simple, the back-end of the app allows for businesses to have ultimate control over the campaigns they create, managing margins and giving  Forest Founders the flexibility to work with almost every type of business. The app will be developed with React Native so both iOS and Android users can contribute to the cause. We will connect Forest Founders Web App existing database so our members can earn points and rewards through their online profile while collecting trees at participating businesses. Forest Founders PartnersThe National Forest Foundation & Trees For The Future ​    Each month we will use your contributions to plant trees on your behalf through our partner, the National Forest Foundation, the nonprofit arm of the US Forest Service. Our native trees are planted exclusively in US National Forests across the country. Trees are planted only in optimal planting conditions to allow for best growth practices by experienced tree planting specialists. We also plant trees through Trees For The Future in agro-forestry projects across Africa. INDIEGOGO Perks Every perk we offer to our backers will help fund the development of our mobile app. We also offer a unique package that can be purchased to enhance your subscription tier. The tier 4 perk will allow you to subscribe at a higher reward point multiplier to earn points more quickly. Points can be spent either on our exclusive merchandise or to plant more trees. Part of the proceeds from this fundraising will also be used to subsidize our rewards program and offer exciting, exclusive rewards you can only get by selecting the Founding Member perk. We will also create a section on our website to acknowledge our Founding Members and thank them for their generosity. Become a Founding Member of Forest Founders and help us, help you, help the planet.  The Carbon Accountability Plan is a way to inspire people to take stock in the health of our planet. A little difference can go a long way when a massive community of people join forces for one cause. We want to hear your ideas and let donors give their active input to grow Forest Founders to its true potential. Supporting this campaign will allow us to build stronger programs and subsidize our rewards program to better reward our members' environmentalism. Join Us! Help us heal our planet. Subscribe to our Carbon Accountability Plan on forestfounders.org to donate $20 on a monthly basis and use our app to connect with businesses that will plant extra trees. 
The money we spend daily builds our carbon footprint.
Every dollar we spend can somehow be linked to carbon emissions. 
Every product we buy has an environmental cost. 
Globalisation has created a carbon problem the likes of which have never been seen.
Even organic produce needs to be transported on trucks. 
Becoming a vegetarian will only result in a 40% reduction of your carbon footprint.
Changing to LED light bulbs and taking shorter showers barely reduce one’s carbon footprint.
 We have a solution, and it only costs $20 a month, less than the cost of a tank of gas (a little more than netflix…). We need to become the change we want to see. Become a member and subscribe today. Go to forestfounders.org to start your journey and begin planting your forest. Our future depends on it. TL;DR - Forest Founders is a non-profit organization with the mission of carbon accountability.

<p>My name is Myra and I would like to warmly welcome you to my Cycle 2 Recycle crowdfunding campaign! Cycle 2 Recycle is a project I have set up out of pure optimism, idealism, and out of the <strong>need and willingness to take action and make a difference</strong> for our beloved planet.</p>
<p>I was born and raised in the <strong>Netherlands</strong> but I have been living in <strong>Italy</strong> since 2012. In the past few years I have embarked on two solo bike tours through Europe, during which I was simply <strong>appalled by the huge amount of plastic waste</strong> that I found basically everywhere around me: plastic bottles and wraps just left there by previous visitors who cared more for their perfect selfie instead of the environment that hosted them, and equally disturbing amounts of plastic thrown away onto the roadside by car drivers and road cyclists.</p>
<p>Ideally I wanted to pick up this plastic and leave it at recycling or waste collecting stations, but my fully-packed bike simply didn't allow me to. This summer of 2019 however <strong>the game changes!</strong> I have decided to combine my passion for cycling with my passion for the environment, and <strong>that's how Cycle 2 Recycle was born</strong>.</p>
<p>On the <strong>29th of June</strong> I will depart from <strong>Turin in Italy</strong> with a very pink &amp; very big and heavy cargo bike, crossing the <strong>Swiss Alps</strong> and then <strong>into Germany towards the Moselle Valley</strong>.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Cycle 2 Recycle is an initiative that shows that everybody can make a difference to try to make the world a better place. Initiatives like these don't necessarily have to start on a huge, global scale; making changes in smaller local communities is equally important.<br/><br/>By contributing to Cycle 2 Recycle you will support a small-sized, yet very passionate initiative aimed at making people more aware about the huge plastic problem and inspiring them to stop using disposable plastics.<br/>The fact that I will be cycling all the way from Italy to Germany, passing over the Swiss Alps with a pretty heavy cargo bike while collecting plastic waste left there by others, hopefully helps others to see and understand the lengths (literally!) I am prepared to go through to get this important message across.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>To be completely honest, I don't foresee any major challenges or obstacles during the big adventure. The worst that could happen is a flat tire, worn down brake pads, a major downpour on my way up the Alps, or I could get sick along the way. However, having embarked on other bike trips in the past I can assure you that these things are all surmountable and I see no reason whatsoever why they would put my bike trip in danger. As I mentioned before, optimism and idealism are in my blood so I will persevere with my head held high!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I said this before but I will say it again: my <strong>main goal is to raise awareness</strong> about the plastic problem and to<strong> inspire people</strong> to stop using single-use plastics. With the right information, education, and tools I am convinced this is something we can achieve by working together. So if you don't have the means to contribute with a donation, please help me spread the word about Cycle 2 Recycle!</p>

</div></div>","My name is Myra and I would like to warmly welcome you to my Cycle 2 Recycle crowdfunding campaign! Cycle 2 Recycle is a project I have set up out of pure optimism, idealism, and out of the need and willingness to take action and make a difference for our beloved planet.
I was born and raised in the Netherlands but I have been living in Italy since 2012. In the past few years I have embarked on two solo bike tours through Europe, during which I was simply appalled by the huge amount of plastic waste that I found basically everywhere around me: plastic bottles and wraps just left there by previous visitors who cared more for their perfect selfie instead of the environment that hosted them, and equally disturbing amounts of plastic thrown away onto the roadside by car drivers and road cyclists.
Ideally I wanted to pick up this plastic and leave it at recycling or waste collecting stations, but my fully-packed bike simply didn't allow me to. This summer of 2019 however the game changes! I have decided to combine my passion for cycling with my passion for the environment, and that's how Cycle 2 Recycle was born.
On the 29th of June I will depart from Turin in Italy with a very pink & very big and heavy cargo bike, crossing the Swiss Alps and then into Germany towards the Moselle Valley. I will be collecting as much plastic waste as possible from the roadside, and bring it to recycling and waste collecting stations along the itinerary. After a break in the Moselle Valley I will then cycle all the way back again towards Turin, but along a different route.
With this initiative I hope to raise more awareness about the plastic problem, inspire people to stop using disposable plastics and to show that if we really want to, we can all contribute in our very own way. And with your help, I plan to continue fighting plastic pollution one bike trip at a time!

 Refuse plastic bags.
Bring your own reusable bag, use your pockets or your purse or juggle your way through the parking lot.
Australia recently banned plastic grocery bags for 3 Months and reduced plastic consumption by 80%!
Refuse single-use plastics and stay resolved to do so - permanently



ReUse…everything you can
Bring your own container or bag to bulk stores.
Find a second or third or tenth “life” for something you may have previously recycled until it’s spent.
Repair what can still be used and just needs a fix



Reduce what you do need and find ways to make less waste.
Americans waste an average of 23% of the food they buy and throw away 185 lbs of plastic per year.
Become friends with a re-usable water bottle, buy only the amount of food you need, take your own silverware and ditch the plastic fork when eating take away or convenience foods.



Rot and regenerate the soil
Make a compost bin in the yard or worm bin in the house
When taken to the landfill, food scraps create greenhouse gasses that account for 8% of greenhouse gas released into the current atmosphere. Cutting down on food waste could have nearly the same impact on reducing emissions over the next three decades as onshore wind turbines

<p>Ecoed App is the brain child of Argentinian sustainability professional and game designer Maria Soledad Riestra (Sole to her mates) as part of her ongoing work in the field of environmental education. </p>
<p>Once you enter our Ecoed world, Turby, Wavi, Reci and Halt will help you reach the highest level of lighter life on Earth in their respective areas of footprint - Energy, Water, Waste, Health and Well-being - by earning points through one-on-one or group game rounds, with quizzes that test and raise awareness on sustainable behaviours, and actions to take back to your daily life. The more quizzes you play and actions you take, the more points you make! Players will also be able to submit their own questions and actions, thus co-creating the app on an ongoing basis. </p>
<h3><strong>Our campaign and why we think it is important</strong></h3>
<p>We passionately believe that we all want to live more sustainably, we just lack the understanding of how. Ecoed will inspire and enable children, adults and families to learn more about their personal environmental footprint, and the kind of daily actions each one of us can take to reduce our impact, which will collectively lead to a more sustainable future for people and planet.</p>
<p>We know how environmental issues can seem heavy hearted and hard to approach at an individual level. What excites us the most about this project is that Ecoed is here to be that bridge that connects individuals from all around the world, in a positive, constructive way, to respond to the ecological challenges of our time, by doing and acting on those things that are within our arms' reach - the daily little things which, collectively, can make a huge difference. </p>
<h3><strong>What can you help us achieve?</strong></h3>
<ul></ul>
<p>WWF states that <i>""Everyday choices we make, such as how often and how far we drive our cars, buying our food or turning up our thermostat one degree more when it's cold, when combined have a big impact on the environment on a global scale.""</i> (WWF, 2013). </p>
<p>Our individual actions may seem small to us, but the collective ripple effect of all of us combined can be a game changer and make a systemic shift possible. By contributing to this campaign, you will help us reach out to as many people as possible with an easy to use, accessible, engaging tool to enable and empower individuals to be the change we all want to see in the world. Once developed, Ecoed will be made available and promoted as a fun and educational tool for children and adults across the globe. </p>
<p>If you feel strongly that we all have a role to play in the future of our planet, then Ecoed can take us one step closer towards understanding what we can do as individuals in order to have a positive impact and become active change makers on a daily basis. We all have the ability to make this happen and with Ecoed it also makes it fun!</p>

</div><div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3></div><div>
<p>Ecoed does not present significant risks given its low cost and versatility, provided that it is a technological development. Now, we know that the online market is saturated with apps and tools, and people can also be overwhelmed with information. We strongly believe that Ecoed's advantage lies in its proposition to attract people of all ages, being the only app that combines interactivity, gamification, learning and behavioural change in the field of sustainability. Our previous work and research has shown us that there's a significant need and appetite from people and organisations, and even schools to engage with more sustainability and ecology-driven content, and how traditional means of learning are giving way to more interactive, combined classroom and online led methods, which is what Ecoed would be offering.  </p>
<p>We are also aware of the fact that we need to make sure Ecoed can remain relevant throughout time. With the overwhelming offer of technological content, we are conscious that we need to continuously improve and monitor how people respond to the app, connect with our users and bring enhancements to the app in order to make it appealing both in the short and the long term. And believe us, we have so many ideas in the pipeline to continue developing Ecoed once it's launched, that you wouldn't imagine! From AR (Augmented Reality) features, to engaging with local communities and businesses to install 'Ecoed money' and 'Ecoed rewards', our ambition is for Ecoed to bring about an ongoing culture of respect and care for our environment, embedded in the way that we think and do things daily. We can't do all at once, but we need to start somewhere! And getting Ecoed app ready and publicly available is the first, big step.</p>
<h3>Who we are </h3>
<p>We both - Sole, the game creator and Zoe, the project manager - are driven, passionate women with a strong entrepreneurial spirit and a vocation for the environment that brought us to work together. We met through a project we were commissioned to work on for a UK WWF funded initiative to build a social community around alternative financial models in the UK, in 2013. As colleagues we clicked right away and have worked together whenever we have had the opportunity. </p>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><p>There are many ways in which you can contribute to this project. Starting with funding (yes!) but also simply getting the word out there, sharing our campaign and Ecoed's website on social media, or even sending us some encouraging words about the project! You can also contact us if you wish to become a member of our team and lead the roll out of Ecoed in your city or town; we will guide you through some of the actions and events you can host to hopefully bring even more people onboard into this new era of sustainable living! </p><p>And if you have other ideas, we also welcome your feedback and engaging in conversations about this project.</p></div>","Ecoed App is the brain child of Argentinian sustainability professional and game designer Maria Soledad Riestra (Sole to her mates) as part of her ongoing work in the field of environmental education. 
Once you enter our Ecoed world, Turby, Wavi, Reci and Halt will help you reach the highest level of lighter life on Earth in their respective areas of footprint - Energy, Water, Waste, Health and Well-being - by earning points through one-on-one or group game rounds, with quizzes that test and raise awareness on sustainable behaviours, and actions to take back to your daily life. The more quizzes you play and actions you take, the more points you make! Players will also be able to submit their own questions and actions, thus co-creating the app on an ongoing basis. 
Our campaign and why we think it is important
We passionately believe that we all want to live more sustainably, we just lack the understanding of how. Ecoed will inspire and enable children, adults and families to learn more about their personal environmental footprint, and the kind of daily actions each one of us can take to reduce our impact, which will collectively lead to a more sustainable future for people and planet.
We know how environmental issues can seem heavy hearted and hard to approach at an individual level. What excites us the most about this project is that Ecoed is here to be that bridge that connects individuals from all around the world, in a positive, constructive way, to respond to the ecological challenges of our time, by doing and acting on those things that are within our arms' reach - the daily little things which, collectively, can make a huge difference. 
What can you help us achieve?

WWF states that ""Everyday choices we make, such as how often and how far we drive our cars, buying our food or turning up our thermostat one degree more when it's cold, when combined have a big impact on the environment on a global scale."" (WWF, 2013). 
Our individual actions may seem small to us, but the collective ripple effect of all of us combined can be a game changer and make a systemic shift possible. By contributing to this campaign, you will help us reach out to as many people as possible with an easy to use, accessible, engaging tool to enable and empower individuals to be the change we all want to see in the world. Once developed, Ecoed will be made available and promoted as a fun and educational tool for children and adults across the globe. 
If you feel strongly that we all have a role to play in the future of our planet, then Ecoed can take us one step closer towards understanding what we can do as individuals in order to have a positive impact and become active change makers on a daily basis. We all have the ability to make this happen and with Ecoed it also makes it fun!
What We Need & What You Will Get

We are asking for funding that will enable our small team to get Ecoed up and running for a cost of 60.000 USD.
If you donate to this campaign we can offer you free licenses and exclusive access to the app, which you can give to your friends or offer as a gift to a school.  You can also receive an 'Ecoed guide' with inspiring information and ideas to engage with other people, friends, and family, and become an 'Ecoed Ambassador' in your local community. Also, If you have a business with products or services that are sustainable / eco-friendly, you can get in-app advertising and sponsorship packages to promote your business within the Ecoed community.

<h3>What we're up to</h3>
<p>Swale is a one-of-a-kind platform that encourages New Yorkers to connect with edible ecology, and asks us to reconsider our collective use of land and waterways. Swale hosts public tours and educational workshops, and welcomes around 500 public visitors daily. In 2016 Swale docked at public piers in the South Bronx, Governors Island and Brooklyn Bridge Park, hosting over 60,000 visitors, 1,000 park tours, 60 school groups, and 30 free public programs. In 2017, Swale has returned to NYC and needs your help in order to continue to serve the public. Swale is the only water-based public food forest in the country (that we know of!). </p>

My name is Caitlyn Kenney, a Fine Arts graduate of Boston University and founder of Cycle – a startup aiming to bring permaculture ideals to the South Shore area of Massachusetts, beginning in the Township of Dartmouth with an idea of compost collection on bicycles!</p><p>Planting the permaculture seed in the South Coast is an important first step in bringing about the cultural and societal shift many places on the East Coast are missing. By starting in a small town like Dartmouth, bicycle-­based compost collection routes will be simple, effective, and efficient, allowing for a cleaner and better­-functioning startup that has a greater capacity to reach and affect more citizens. The simpler and more efficient the plan, the easier it will be to get Cycle off of the ground (so to speak!) and the greater the impact on the township as a whole – meaning a more wholesome impact on the entire community therein.</p><p>Your contribution is the key component in the launch of this plan. Without your support, Cycle will quite literally remain unborn: it will have no base for operations for composting; it will have no access to bike trailers or compostable bags for the collection of the civilians' food waste; it will have no way to reach out and educate potential participants throughout Dartmouth. Your contribution to our cause today has the potential to change an entire town, and all of its inhabitants, for generations to come.</p><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><p>Our goal is to raise 12,000 US dollars. This funding will go towards our compostable bags, in which our clients will put their own compostables and food waste, and it will go towards purchasing supplies to build our composting bins. This funding will go towards our bicycle trailers, upon which we will collect our clients' compost, and it will go towards purchasing a space out of which we can work our operation. This funding will go towards incorporating our business along with making sure that we are a full and legal entity, and will cover any extraneous legal fees involved in the process of creating a business, as well as providing a way for us to market ourselves. Lastly, and most importantly, this funding will ensure our cyclists' safety, pay, and insurance; it will allow us to hold educational workshops for interested minds, and it will allow us to create community gardens throughout Dartmouth.</p><p>With all of the awesome humanist perks aside, you'll also be able to get some swell personal perks for your donation as well, as an extra bit of thanks from us here at Cycle!</p><p>$5 – You will receive a Cycle-themed bumper sticker for your car, wall, window, laptop – you place it, it will stick!</p><p>$15 – An organically-grown cotton tote bag will be sent to you, for all of your carrying needs!</p><p>$25 – You will receive a BPA­-free Cycle water bottle, so you can show support for composting and a healthy self!</p><p>$50 – Mystery Perk!

If you've ever dreamt of having your name on that which drags food waste around town, look no further, this is the perk for you! You will also receive the $50 mystery perk!</p><p>$500 – For a donation this large you will be given a bicycle helmet, hand­painted by Caitlyn Kenney! You will also be given a Cycle bumper sticker and the mystery perk from the $50 donation bracket!</p><p>$1000 – If you donate $1000, you will be given a 20”x20” painting, crafted by Ms. Caitlyn Kenney's own hands! Furthermore, you will receive each other perk listed above!</p><p> </p><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p><p>Permaculture is a methodology that emphasizes “Earth Care, Fair Share, People Care.” Acting on these principles is the key to creating a healthy, robust world that will allow humanity to prosper and thrive for generations to come, in tandem with the environment around us. Permaculture is a set of ideals for a paradigm shift – one that opens a door for us to move away from the outmoded American lifestyle of overconsumption and consumer­-dependence to a lifestyle of interdependence, self­-sustainability, and prosperous production.</p><p>When we think of the phrase 'Reduce, Reuse, Recycle', oftentimes we think of papers, plastics, tin and aluminum, cardboard; but very rarely do we consider the “fifth element” of recyclables – that is, food. On average, 60%­-70% of the waste in landfills is compostable – and much of that comes in the form of food.</p><p>Now, imagine what the world would look like if we took all of that usable landfill 'waste' and repurposed it, creating healthy, nutrient-­dense, rich soil in which to grow fruits and vegetables? That is the action­-oriented goal of Cycle's compost collection: reduce the citizen's waste footprint and bolster their environmental contribution. Furthermore, Cycle's compost collection will take place on bicycles, meaning that Cycle's carbon­-based environmental impact will be at net­-zero, or even net­-negative! That means that our company will not only be preventing extra carbon from entering the atmosphere, but also not contributing any carbon emissions (besides our breathing) ­ helping stymy the greenhouse effect in the Earth's atmosphere.</p><p>The endgame of Cycle is to bring a permaculture ideal to the South Shore, through the spreading of education and awareness and leading through the example of composting, beginning in the town of Dartmouth, Massachusetts. Once the routes for the cyclists have been mapped out, and the compost collection has begun, the final step will be organizing permaculture­-centered educational workshops to teach interested people about the greater benefits of composting, gardening, self-sustainability, and so forth, to spread awareness not only of Cycle, but also how organizations like it can impact the social, economic, political, and personal landscapes surrounding them.</p><p>To bring it all home, even though a program like Cycle is centered in a small suburban town on the East Coast, it follows a system of ideals that are cropping up in places and people throughout the country.</p><p>These people and these ideas have the potential to reverberate together to create a sweeping change, on both small and large scales. It starts small, yes, but it blossoms into something beautiful – just like every great moment in history, just like every change in ideals; just like every work of art, every invention, every composition, every story. Cycle, in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, may not directly impact you in California, New York, Alabama, Texas ­but it will directly affect thousands of living people at its epicenter, and thousands more with its ripples: as education spreads, as knowledge and understanding are disseminated through the collaborating minds, as the environmental impact of humankind begins to lessen with each bag of compost stashed on the back of a bicycle and turned into soil to replenish the Earth with which we live. To bring it all home – the impact is somewhere, that ripples out everywhere. And it can only happen if someone, anywhere, decides to join hands with us to make a change happen, and support an ideal that benefits everyone and everything on Earth.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><p>As with any startup, there are hurdles that need to be leapt. One of the biggest hurdles we face right now is finding a space in which to set up our composting bins. Land is expensive – hence why we come to the participants of Indiegogo. Without a base of operations, we will have no place to put the compost we collect.</p><p>We will have no place to store our compost, no place to mix it, make it, or distribute it from.</p><p>The second hurdle to overcome will be marketing ourselves – letting people know who we are, what we do, and why it is important, all in a clear and concise way. Outreach, essentially. Many people in Dartmouth garden – be it flower gardens, or vegetable gardens. To be able to offer them affordable, substantive compost to mix into their soil to grow vibrant flowers and produce bountiful harvests is a major aspect of our mission, but will be difficult to make happen if no one knows about or supports our existence.</p><p>Not only will your support help give us a home, but it will also showcase to the town of Dartmouth a broad level of support from like-­minded people, within the community and without. Support like that is encouraging and uplifting, and seeing that they are not alone in the cause helps inspire people to do good in the little ways that they can.</p><p>Our final challenge is the upwards climb of legislation. Seeking to become a full­-fledged legally-<br/>recognized entity is a process – but the good news is that we have already begun the steep climb. We have met with entrepreneurs and businesspeople, and are currently in a working partnership with an attorney­-at-­law to legally become a Limited­ Liability Company, or LLC. It's only a matter of time, and the authenticity of becoming a legally recognized entity will open a lot of doors for Cycle to reach out and positively impact the surrounding community. The completion of this process will allow individuals, businesses, legislature, and interested parties to be able to look at us in a real, responsible light – something very important for a young female entering the business world with an idea that can bring change to the status quo.</p><p>Keeping these hurdles in mind, we don't want you to think that we're so totally green (the other way, not the recycling kind) that we're incapable of overcoming the challenges laid before us. As a fine arts major, founder and owner Caitlyn Kenney has years of experience in marketing and customer relations – her down-to-earth experience from waiting tables for several years aside. Additionally, as stated above, we have literally dozens of different perspectives available to us – from psychiatrists to minimum­-wage employees and attorneys-at-­law, to entrepreneurs and businesspeople and energy consultants, to horticulturists and college students and professors, to name several – and these perspectives, opinions, and ideas keep us fresh and capable, providing us with new ideas and multiple facets of information to allow us to ride smoothly over all of the bumps in the road.</p><p>The last piece of the puzzle is you and your contribution. With your funding, we'll be able to get Cycle off of the ground and into the homes of the citizens of Dartmouth, bringing to them a functional step to a healthier world and greener society.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p><p>Monetary contribution isn't the only support that you can give us. Spread the word! Check out our website; come to our workshops. If you live out of the South Coast area, do your own research on Permaculture. Learn about why it is important. Start a garden. Talk to your friends and family and coworkers about what you learn; share the wealth of your knowledge. Start your own company or business and follow your dreams, so that your passions may better your life and the lives of those surrounding you. In the end, we're all in this together, and if we suffer or don't allow ourselves to be capable, if we aren't enabling ourselves to be the best that we can be, then we can't be the best, or do the best, for the people that surround us. We deserve that, as much as everyone else. Great ripples cause great waves.</p><p>So please, feel free to contribute in any way that you can – monetary or otherwise. Every way that you contribute is meaningful, no matter how big or small; no matter how direct or how indirect. If you have questions, contact us – our email and website are listed below, and we would be thrilled to hear from you and answer whatever questions we can. You are just as much a part of this as we are. You are just as important.</p><p>Finally, thank you. Thank you for reading all of this, for taking the time to learn about us and follow up with us. Thank you for your interest and concern. Cycle would be nowhere without you, and for that, we are grateful beyond measure. We'll keep in touch. We hope that you do too.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""http://cyclecomposting.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">cyclecomposting.com </a> --- cyclecomposting@gmail.com ---  774 - 202 - 9312</p></div>","Hello!

Furthermore, you will receive each other perk listed above! The ImpactPermaculture is a methodology that emphasizes “Earth Care, Fair Share, People Care.” Acting on these principles is the key to creating a healthy, robust world that will allow humanity to prosper and thrive for generations to come, in tandem with the environment around us. Permaculture is a set of ideals for a paradigm shift – one that opens a door for us to move away from the outmoded American lifestyle of overconsumption and consumer­-dependence to a lifestyle of interdependence, self­-sustainability, and prosperous production.When we think of the phrase 'Reduce, Reuse, Recycle', oftentimes we think of papers, plastics, tin and aluminum, cardboard; but very rarely do we consider the “fifth element” of recyclables – that is, food. On average, 60%­-70% of the waste in landfills is compostable – and much of that comes in the form of food.Now, imagine what the world would look like if we took all of that usable landfill 'waste' and repurposed it, creating healthy, nutrient-­dense, rich soil in which to grow fruits and vegetables? That is the action­-oriented goal of Cycle's compost collection: reduce the citizen's waste footprint and bolster their environmental contribution. Furthermore, Cycle's compost collection will take place on bicycles, meaning that Cycle's carbon­-based environmental impact will be at net­-zero, or even net­-negative! That means that our company will not only be preventing extra carbon from entering the atmosphere, but also not contributing any carbon emissions (besides our breathing) ­ helping stymy the greenhouse effect in the Earth's atmosphere.The endgame of Cycle is to bring a permaculture ideal to the South Shore, through the spreading of education and awareness and leading through the example of composting, beginning in the town of Dartmouth, Massachusetts. Once the routes for the cyclists have been mapped out, and the compost collection has begun, the final step will be organizing permaculture­-centered educational workshops to teach interested people about the greater benefits of composting, gardening, self-sustainability, and so forth, to spread awareness not only of Cycle, but also how organizations like it can impact the social, economic, political, and personal landscapes surrounding them.To bring it all home, even though a program like Cycle is centered in a small suburban town on the East Coast, it follows a system of ideals that are cropping up in places and people throughout the country.These people and these ideas have the potential to reverberate together to create a sweeping change, on both small and large scales. It starts small, yes, but it blossoms into something beautiful – just like every great moment in history, just like every change in ideals; just like every work of art, every invention, every composition, every story. Cycle, in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, may not directly impact you in California, New York, Alabama, Texas ­but it will directly affect thousands of living people at its epicenter, and thousands more with its ripples: as education spreads, as knowledge and understanding are disseminated through the collaborating minds, as the environmental impact of humankind begins to lessen with each bag of compost stashed on the back of a bicycle and turned into soil to replenish the Earth with which we live. To bring it all home – the impact is somewhere, that ripples out everywhere. And it can only happen if someone, anywhere, decides to join hands with us to make a change happen, and support an ideal that benefits everyone and everything on Earth. Risks & ChallengesAs with any startup, there are hurdles that need to be leapt. One of the biggest hurdles we face right now is finding a space in which to set up our composting bins. Land is expensive – hence why we come to the participants of Indiegogo. Without a base of operations, we will have no place to put the compost we collect.We will have no place to store our compost, no place to mix it, make it, or distribute it from.The second hurdle to overcome will be marketing ourselves – letting people know who we are, what we do, and why it is important, all in a clear and concise way. Outreach, essentially. Many people in Dartmouth garden – be it flower gardens, or vegetable gardens. To be able to offer them affordable, substantive compost to mix into their soil to grow vibrant flowers and produce bountiful harvests is a major aspect of our mission, but will be difficult to make happen if no one knows about or supports our existence.Not only will your support help give us a home, but it will also showcase to the town of Dartmouth a broad level of support from like-­minded people, within the community and without. Support like that is encouraging and uplifting, and seeing that they are not alone in the cause helps inspire people to do good in the little ways that they can.Our final challenge is the upwards climb of legislation. Seeking to become a full­-fledged legally-recognized entity is a process – but the good news is that we have already begun the steep climb. We have met with entrepreneurs and businesspeople, and are currently in a working partnership with an attorney­-at-­law to legally become a Limited­ Liability Company, or LLC. It's only a matter of time, and the authenticity of becoming a legally recognized entity will open a lot of doors for Cycle to reach out and positively impact the surrounding community. The completion of this process will allow individuals, businesses, legislature, and interested parties to be able to look at us in a real, responsible light – something very important for a young female entering the business world with an idea that can bring change to the status quo.Keeping these hurdles in mind, we don't want you to think that we're so totally green (the other way, not the recycling kind) that we're incapable of overcoming the challenges laid before us. As a fine arts major, founder and owner Caitlyn Kenney has years of experience in marketing and customer relations – her down-to-earth experience from waiting tables for several years aside. Additionally, as stated above, we have literally dozens of different perspectives available to us – from psychiatrists to minimum­-wage employees and attorneys-at-­law, to entrepreneurs and businesspeople and energy consultants, to horticulturists and college students and professors, to name several – and these perspectives, opinions, and ideas keep us fresh and capable, providing us with new ideas and multiple facets of information to allow us to ride smoothly over all of the bumps in the road.The last piece of the puzzle is you and your contribution. With your funding, we'll be able to get Cycle off of the ground and into the homes of the citizens of Dartmouth, bringing to them a functional step to a healthier world and greener society. Other Ways You Can HelpMonetary contribution isn't the only support that you can give us. Spread the word! Check out our website; come to our workshops. If you live out of the South Coast area, do your own research on Permaculture. Learn about why it is important. Start a garden. Talk to your friends and family and coworkers about what you learn; share the wealth of your knowledge. Start your own company or business and follow your dreams, so that your passions may better your life and the lives of those surrounding you. In the end, we're all in this together, and if we suffer or don't allow ourselves to be capable, if we aren't enabling ourselves to be the best that we can be, then we can't be the best, or do the best, for the people that surround us. We deserve that, as much as everyone else. Great ripples cause great waves.So please, feel free to contribute in any way that you can – monetary or otherwise. Every way that you contribute is meaningful, no matter how big or small; no matter how direct or how indirect. If you have questions, contact us – our email and website are listed below, and we would be thrilled to hear from you and answer whatever questions we can. You are just as much a part of this as we are. You are just as important.Finally, thank you. Thank you for reading all of this, for taking the time to learn about us and follow up with us. Thank you for your interest and concern. Cycle would be nowhere without you, and for that, we are grateful beyond measure. We'll keep in touch. We hope that you do too.  cyclecomposting.com  --- cyclecomposting@gmail.com ---  774 - 202 - 9312",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The ALTERNATIVE story started in 2013, when I (Ioana) came across the devastating impacts of plastic pollution on wildlife. It turned out to be a global problem, no matter how far-away or close by the inhabited areas, plastic started suffocating life. Wild life and human life as well.</p>
<p>Not being the kind of person to give up, look away or get overwhelmed by the size of the problem, I decided to do something. TO CHANGE. The world. Turned out that was big to think and say, but quite relative to actually DO. So I started with the beginning: ME. This made sense. I started living without plastic. I refused all plastic bags that everybody so eagerly were handing out, I started buying fruits and veggies bag-free, made a habit of going to the local market and buy food in bulk, local grown &amp; harvested and simply REFUSE buying supermarket goods wrapped in plastic. I gave up bottled water and looked for spring water in the neighboring areas and chose tap water when spring water was out of reach.</p>
<p>Then moved to new grounds: refused plastic straws, take-away containers made out of plastic, take away-cups &amp; single-use cutlery. Then I discovered there are alternatives for personal care products as well, healthier and of course, plastic -free. Every section of my life changed for the better.</p>
<p>But please do not think that I gave up all stuff that make our lives easy, comfy &amp; convenient. Nonono, I started a journey to discover healthy, natural, sustainable ALTERNATIVEs to these most common single-use plastic objects.</p>
<p>With CURIOSITY &amp; MOTIVATION, the adventure begun and the ALTERNATIVE team started happening. Soon Mihai joined in, with his wider view of what can to be done to live &amp; enjoy the outdoor leaving only footprints behind and zero trash, as a bike enthusiast &amp; nature lover, also very much determined to make a positive change in the world starting with himself.</p>
<p>Starting this journey brought us many happy moments. But also clarity &amp; vision. There are tones of things that we want to do. So we started to talk to everybody we knew (friends, family, colleagues, friends of friends) or didn't know about our project. And more and more people joined in, acknowledging that plastic pollution is a big problem of today's world to which we all contribute, even if we realize it or not. And because we all contribute to it, we can also contribute to change it.</p>
<p>Our enthusiasm gathered lots of beautiful people around our project. (Barna, Thomas, Cristi, Adi, Tessa, Alejandra, Mayu, Larisa, Zsolt, Ale, Andu, Dana, Viorica, thank you all for shining &amp; making ALTERNATIVE happen &lt;3).</p>
<p>And so we learnt that great things can be achieved, when there are many of us working for the same purpose. That there are ALTERNATIVEs to replace the single-use plastics, that there are people that are willing to get involved and do something, that we can contribute to our community by finding solutions to big problems and fixing them locally.</p>
<p>We took the responsibility of finding natural, ethical, sustainable &amp; healthy alternatives to most common single-use plastics. Some of them are already developed with success by beautiful people, others were developed by us. And because we want to work within our community, thus involving as many people as possible and bringing the plastic problem and its solutions closer to us, <strong>we ask for your help.</strong></p>
<p>We took an ought to live a plastic- free life and stop contributing to the production of new plastics. Therefore our products are completely plastic-free, including the packaging . We focus on using as little resources as possible in the making-of process. We track the materials we use and pay fairly all the people involved in the manufacturing process.</p>
<p>We have discovered and created alternatives to some of the most common single-use plastic objects that become trash (food wrappers, thin &amp; thick bags, food packaging, food &amp; drink containers, toothbrushes) and with your help we want to create more (cutlery, cups, toys, straws, napkins, composter).</p>
<p>40% of the world's plastic production is represented by packaging, which becomes unrecyclable trash the moment we started using the products inside.</p>
<p>Every piece of plastic ever made still exists somewhere on this planet, so every new plastic that we stop from being produced throughout changing our behavior will be a great accomplishment.</p>
<p>And just for the sake of illustrating what I am talking about, in 2013 I was cosuming about <strong>3.467 </strong>pieces of plastic packging, compared to <strong>21</strong> in 2015. </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>At ALTERNATIVE we believe in working together, working local within the community, being flexible and creative, accepting challenges and creating the perfect environment for win-win situations.</p>
<p>Every piece of plastic that we refused meant LESS NEW PLASTIC WAS PRODUCED. Every plastic item we succeed to replace in our daily life meant less trash in nature. And every ALTERNATIVE to a single-use plastic item we can share with you will be a great achievement.</p>
<p>We created some packages to enable you to start your plastic-free journey, be ready to receive them for Christmas (for orders before 10th of December) or in January, to support your New Years Eve Resolution of having a #Zen2017 (for orders placed starting 11th of December).</p>
<p>Choose the perk that fits your goals and aspirations. You can start with educating yourself on the matter of plastic and its negative impacts or start exploring the alternatives and be part of the solution.</p>
<p>And if you have any thoughts for us, questions, suggestions or wish to contribute in any way, we are waiting for your questions at hello@alternative.blue.</p>
<p>We used all of our funds to create, test &amp; manufacture the bags. <strong>We ask for your support</strong> to start using our products, believe in them and make change happen. With the funds collected in this campaign we want to bring to life the next wave of natural, ethical &amp; sustainable ALTERNATIVEs: food containers from safe materials, eco straws, plastic-free toys, outdoor cups, outdoor plastic-free kits for camping, eco cutlery, cotton napkins, ceramic composter.</p>
<p>All ALTERNATIVE products are manufactured locally, in Romania (Sibiu, Oradea &amp; Cluj-Napoca) with the help, skills and enthusiasm of passionate creative people that love what they are doing. We work with friends &amp; family. We involve our community and make objects come to life here, on a local scale.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In Romania, <strong>only 5% of the trash is recycled</strong>. More than 7.000.000 tons of trash end up in landfills, rivers, lakes, waterways and other places in nature from where we source our food and take our water.</p>
<p>The plastic packaging consumed by Romanians varies between <strong>470 &amp; 5.500 i</strong>tems per person <strong>every year</strong>. Most of them (23%) are sweets &amp; snacks wrappers, followed by thin plastic bags used mainly for fruits &amp; veggies (16%). Take-away containers represent 12% of the plastic consumption, while 9% is claimed by food packaging. None of these plastics are recyclable (nor in Romania, nor in other waste facilities around the globe).</p>
<p>We invite you to DARE &amp; take our challenge of measuring your single-use plastic footprint. Fill in the ALT postcard and acknowledge which are the most common plastics you use. Once you know where you stand, you will know from where to start the transformation. </p>
</div><div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3></div><div>
<p>We make products that are meant to last and be used over and over again (vs. single use), serving  various purposes. Made from durable high-quality materials, they are not meant for single-use and throw-away, the damage made to the environment being huge in this case. </p>
<p>We love working with natural, old, upcycled, local materials. But there is still a strong trend between people and companies to opt for overseas 'exotic' products &amp; materials vs. local ones,  or new ones vs. of old repurposed ones.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
The ALTERNATIVE story started in 2013, when I (Ioana) came across the devastating impacts of plastic pollution on wildlife. It turned out to be a global problem, no matter how far-away or close by the inhabited areas, plastic started suffocating life. Wild life and human life as well.
Not being the kind of person to give up, look away or get overwhelmed by the size of the problem, I decided to do something. TO CHANGE. The world. Turned out that was big to think and say, but quite relative to actually DO. So I started with the beginning: ME. This made sense. I started living without plastic. I refused all plastic bags that everybody so eagerly were handing out, I started buying fruits and veggies bag-free, made a habit of going to the local market and buy food in bulk, local grown & harvested and simply REFUSE buying supermarket goods wrapped in plastic. I gave up bottled water and looked for spring water in the neighboring areas and chose tap water when spring water was out of reach.
Then moved to new grounds: refused plastic straws, take-away containers made out of plastic, take away-cups & single-use cutlery. Then I discovered there are alternatives for personal care products as well, healthier and of course, plastic -free. Every section of my life changed for the better.
But please do not think that I gave up all stuff that make our lives easy, comfy & convenient. Nonono, I started a journey to discover healthy, natural, sustainable ALTERNATIVEs to these most common single-use plastic objects.
With CURIOSITY & MOTIVATION, the adventure begun and the ALTERNATIVE team started happening. Soon Mihai joined in, with his wider view of what can to be done to live & enjoy the outdoor leaving only footprints behind and zero trash, as a bike enthusiast & nature lover, also very much determined to make a positive change in the world starting with himself.
Starting this journey brought us many happy moments. But also clarity & vision. There are tones of things that we want to do. So we started to talk to everybody we knew (friends, family, colleagues, friends of friends) or didn't know about our project. And more and more people joined in, acknowledging that plastic pollution is a big problem of today's world to which we all contribute, even if we realize it or not. And because we all contribute to it, we can also contribute to change it.
Our enthusiasm gathered lots of beautiful people around our project. (Barna, Thomas, Cristi, Adi, Tessa, Alejandra, Mayu, Larisa, Zsolt, Ale, Andu, Dana, Viorica, thank you all for shining & making ALTERNATIVE happen <3).
And so we learnt that great things can be achieved, when there are many of us working for the same purpose. That there are ALTERNATIVEs to replace the single-use plastics, that there are people that are willing to get involved and do something, that we can contribute to our community by finding solutions to big problems and fixing them locally.
We took the responsibility of finding natural, ethical, sustainable & healthy alternatives to most common single-use plastics. Some of them are already developed with success by beautiful people, others were developed by us. And because we want to work within our community, thus involving as many people as possible and bringing the plastic problem and its solutions closer to us, we ask for your help.
We took an ought to live a plastic- free life and stop contributing to the production of new plastics. Therefore our products are completely plastic-free, including the packaging . We focus on using as little resources as possible in the making-of process. We track the materials we use and pay fairly all the people involved in the manufacturing process.
We have discovered and created alternatives to some of the most common single-use plastic objects that become trash (food wrappers, thin & thick bags, food packaging, food & drink containers, toothbrushes) and with your help we want to create more (cutlery, cups, toys, straws, napkins, composter).
40% of the world's plastic production is represented by packaging, which becomes unrecyclable trash the moment we started using the products inside.
Every piece of plastic ever made still exists somewhere on this planet, so every new plastic that we stop from being produced throughout changing our behavior will be a great accomplishment.
And just for the sake of illustrating what I am talking about, in 2013 I was cosuming about 3.467 pieces of plastic packging, compared to 21 in 2015. 
What We Need & What You Get
At ALTERNATIVE we believe in working together, working local within the community, being flexible and creative, accepting challenges and creating the perfect environment for win-win situations.
Every piece of plastic that we refused meant LESS NEW PLASTIC WAS PRODUCED. Every plastic item we succeed to replace in our daily life meant less trash in nature. And every ALTERNATIVE to a single-use plastic item we can share with you will be a great achievement.
We created some packages to enable you to start your plastic-free journey, be ready to receive them for Christmas (for orders before 10th of December) or in January, to support your New Years Eve Resolution of having a #Zen2017 (for orders placed starting 11th of December).
Choose the perk that fits your goals and aspirations. You can start with educating yourself on the matter of plastic and its negative impacts or start exploring the alternatives and be part of the solution.
And if you have any thoughts for us, questions, suggestions or wish to contribute in any way, we are waiting for your questions at hello@alternative.blue.
We used all of our funds to create, test & manufacture the bags. We ask for your support to start using our products, believe in them and make change happen. With the funds collected in this campaign we want to bring to life the next wave of natural, ethical & sustainable ALTERNATIVEs: food containers from safe materials, eco straws, plastic-free toys, outdoor cups, outdoor plastic-free kits for camping, eco cutlery, cotton napkins, ceramic composter.
All ALTERNATIVE products are manufactured locally, in Romania (Sibiu, Oradea & Cluj-Napoca) with the help, skills and enthusiasm of passionate creative people that love what they are doing. We work with friends & family. We involve our community and make objects come to life here, on a local scale.
The Impact
In Romania, only 5% of the trash is recycled. More than 7.000.000 tons of trash end up in landfills, rivers, lakes, waterways and other places in nature from where we source our food and take our water.
The plastic packaging consumed by Romanians varies between 470 & 5.500 items per person every year. Most of them (23%) are sweets & snacks wrappers, followed by thin plastic bags used mainly for fruits & veggies (16%). Take-away containers represent 12% of the plastic consumption, while 9% is claimed by food packaging. None of these plastics are recyclable (nor in Romania, nor in other waste facilities around the globe).
We invite you to DARE & take our challenge of measuring your single-use plastic footprint. Fill in the ALT postcard and acknowledge which are the most common plastics you use. Once you know where you stand, you will know from where to start the transformation. 
Risks & Challenges
We make products that are meant to last and be used over and over again (vs. single use), serving  various purposes. Made from durable high-quality materials, they are not meant for single-use and throw-away, the damage made to the environment being huge in this case. 
We love working with natural, old, upcycled, local materials. But there is still a strong trend between people and companies to opt for overseas 'exotic' products & materials vs. local ones,  or new ones vs. of old repurposed ones.
Throughout education, awareness raising, innovation, long-term vision and the power of example we try to make a change in how people and companies behave & react. We use recycled paper for packaging and printed materials, we buy our materials locally and organize workshops using old upcycled materials, we opt for quality instead of quantity, we value green ethical social companies and work towards being certified as one in the near future. We learn & innovate continuously and think about the impact we have on the environment and our health with every decision we take.

Other Ways You Can Help
Our main goal is to stop plastic pollution. If you want to help us spread the word, raise awareness, create new products, join our community or find out how you can too fight plastic pollution, drop us a line, we will be honored to hear from you.
And keep in mind: the most effective way to REDUCE the harmful effects of plastic is to stop using it and reduce the demand for new plastic production.

You will get to choose your styles of eyewear whether it will be sunglasses or screen glasses. Gigs was born through a passion for our planet and care for our eyes to see it with. Originating in Chester, UK, the three of us began to design the perfect sunglasses that we thought would not only be essential for our environment, but a stylish icon to it. Contributing to this project would be a huge step towards a sustainable yet stylish product allowing us to expand our range and further our research. We ultimately want to bring more of our ideas to life and want everyone to have access to have a pair of Gigs across the world.  What We Need & What You GetAlongside the persistent hard work we have put into our sunnies; we want to incorporate finished upgraded designs for more styles, blue light filtering & prescription frames with added durability, Zeiss lenses and high tensile sprung hinges to maximize comfort, however we do not have the capital to complete our order, being a startup / standalone company last year and now in the current climate with limited funding it has been challenging. Having the additional capital through providing our product at a discount rate will also help further these amazing glasses and our marketing campaign.Our campaign is to raise capital to be able to offer not only sustainable sunglasses but blue light filtering, computer glasses and prescription eyewear. ""Each pair of our handcrafted sunglasses goes through a process of 250 steps to ensure the highest quality and the perfect protection"".  Our packaging is 100% BiodegradableWe worked hard to create a fully sustainable brand, right down to the packaging.We've worked hard to create fully sustainable sunnies, so why stop at the packaging? Each pair of Gigs will arrive to you in a sleek package which can be re-used or recycled.  The ImpactHere’s your chance! Gigs sunnies have so much to offer, our protection levels don’t stop at our health, but our planet.We have analysed that contributing to the mass creation of wooden products is counterproductive, in 2018 the world emitted 37 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide, we see trees as the lungs of our earth so why use them to create our product? Instead we’ve worked with plant based acetate, which in it's design is far more durable but will compost or breakdown to nothing through sewerage over 12 months.World we are with you!

<p>we wish that with this book, consciousness about our way of treating Mother Nature and all living on Mother Earth will raise in order to bring Peace and Harmony on our beautiful planet.  do you want to be part of the solution? please contribute either by sponsoring the publishing of this tale or by forwarding the information to a friend.</p>
<p>when i sent the book to the printing house in Mexico City, they liked the idea and message so much that they offered to start printing it without asking us for a deposit first, these people hardly know me and believe in it.  but in order to get the books,   well we need to pay at least half of the cost, so that is why we are putting this campaign together.  there are some 200 copies being printed right now.... and printing 1000 covers for it that will be available as we print more copies. i am touched.<br/></p>
<p>like Ataksak, the grand-mother polar bear of the magical tale, our dream is for everyone and everything to be able to live in Peace and Harmony, respecting cultures, differences, toughts.  like a friend of mine told me one day: ''inside we are all the same''... just think about it!</p>
<p>i see this colorful, illustraded magic tale as a tool to bring people closer, reading, listening, observing together!!   i also see it being used to teach about different people and animals living on Turtle Island and their customs, languages... learning geography in the same time...</p>
<p>one of my wish for this book is to have it translated in Maya and in Inuktitut, by that becoming a way to learn native languages.</p>
<p>i already have on my agenda, a few readings of the book, with projections of the illustrations.  during this interactive presentation, the participants will be able to ask questions and find more information about nature, geography, people, customs, languaes.  this will take place at the Biblioteca Maurilio Sanchez de la colonia Zetina Gasca de Puerto Morelos.  it is part of the summer program for the youth of Puerto Morelos.  60 kids are registered to attend the summer camp... and at La Casa de la Cultura de Puerto Morelos.  i just can't wait!!!<br/></p>
<p>we thank you for the time you take every day to bring love, warmth, hugs, respect to everybody and everything around you.... every gesture, every word counts! start with a big big SMILE and see how people respond, its amazing!!!<br/></p>
<h4><b>about us, Ana and Gilles:</b></h4>
<p>we both are artists. each of us in our own way. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<h4><b>Ana <br/></b></h4>my name is Ann, but when i arrived here in Puerto Morelos, my mexican friends found it better to name me Ana, so i became Ana. gracias a mi familia mexicana!<br/><br/><p>in the past years i have developped a technique making a piece of plastic ''fabric'' while recycling plastic shopping bags. some people would call it ''plastic fusion''.  from that piece, i fashion wallets, handbags, beach and shopping bags, book cover, and many more items.  also used, are dog food bags for different parts of the products.  through this art i am bringing awareness about the plastic that surrounds us.  my dream is to have no more plastic bags to work with!!!  <br/></p>
<p>also, i have put together my own local tour here.  i invite our visitors to walk with me in a part of town (la colonia) where not many tourists go, being further away from the beach zone.  through this they lean about history of our pueblo, environmental issues, education system, working conditions, some spanish and mayan words, local products available to them while supporting our local economy... and if i dont know the answer, i just ask around and get that answer... everybody enjoys it, locals and visitors... <br/></p>
<p>we also organize events where the visitors can learn about the traditional way of Mayan cooking.  A Mayan couple from a small pueblo comes to our place and share their knowledge of preparing, cooking and sharing their food.  by that we want more and more people to be aware of the simple life that is enjoyed here and of the culture and traditions that still exist in our part of the planet.  a good time to learn Maya, as they speak together in their native tongue.  Malo Kin (Good Day)<br/></p>
<p>in the past i have organized or participated in events promoting recycling, awareness of Water, local traditions and culture, youth entertainment...<br/></p>
<p>while living here, i had the opportunity to meet people from all over the World.  All are concerned about Mother Earth just like us.  hopefully changes in our way of consuming will help Her!!!!  Gracias !</p>
<h4>Gilles</h4>
<p>has over 50 years experience as a painter, sculptor (wood, stone, bone) and worked for 25 years with Radio Canada in Montreal as a scenic artist.</p>
<p>in his art he likes to representant the first nations culture and traditions.  As he does when representing the Abenaki people in Pow Wow, international and local cultural events, schools, elders homes, historical parks.  he was recepient of a Grant from the Council of Art of Canada - First Nations for work that he did with youth.  his piece ''the signing of the Great Peace, Montreal, 1701'' is part of the permanent collection of the Musée de la Pointe à Calliêres in Montreal.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/dAHiPWAkwoYx-A?projectId=art-project"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/dAHiPWAkwoYx-A?projectId=art-project</a></p>
<p>he has been involved in his comunity and he is a well respected member.</p>
<p>one of his wish is to bring people together, so in order to do so we put together events here in Puerto Morelos where the North (being represented by the Blue Wolf) meet the South (being represented by the Jaguar) while this takes place where visitors from all over the world can participate as well.  and we are looking forward to organize more of these events, where a group of elders from the North would come here and share their cultures and traditions with those living here.<br/></p>
<p>he also enjoys transmitting his knowledge of painting to the youth, he has done so in the past and still is doing it.  the next project is teaching teenagers from Puerto Morelos on how to paint murals.  this will take place in October 2015 at the local library. The project is called ''Dale Voz a la Pared''. we are planning a campaing for it on indigogo life... please check it out!</p>
<p>this is only one of my dreams, to know more, please go to the perks and let's have some coffee!!<br/></p>
<p>we both are concerned about the environment on Mother Earth and the changes that are ocurring which are endangering our future and the one of our children.  we both think that self-respect will bring respect to others.  we both participate and/or organize events supporting the culture, art, youth, environment. we both enjoy nature, people, cultural exchanges,  and simple life!</p>
<p>the video that you are able to see here, is one for you to enjoy a little bit of what we enjoy living.... the image is not so great, but hey i work with what i have available, a regular old school Kodak camera!!!<br/></p>
<p>thank you for your time and support!!! Light, Love and Peace to us All !!<br/></p>

we also organize events where the visitors can learn about the traditional way of Mayan cooking.  A Mayan couple from a small pueblo comes to our place and share their knowledge of preparing, cooking and sharing their food.  by that we want more and more people to be aware of the simple life that is enjoyed here and of the culture and traditions that still exist in our part of the planet.  a good time to learn Maya, as they speak together in their native tongue.  Malo Kin (Good Day)
in the past i have organized or participated in events promoting recycling, awareness of Water, local traditions and culture, youth entertainment...
while living here, i had the opportunity to meet people from all over the World.  All are concerned about Mother Earth just like us.  hopefully changes in our way of consuming will help Her!!!!  Gracias !
Gilles
has over 50 years experience as a painter, sculptor (wood, stone, bone) and worked for 25 years with Radio Canada in Montreal as a scenic artist.
in his art he likes to representant the first nations culture and traditions.  As he does when representing the Abenaki people in Pow Wow, international and local cultural events, schools, elders homes, historical parks.  he was recepient of a Grant from the Council of Art of Canada - First Nations for work that he did with youth.  his piece ''the signing of the Great Peace, Montreal, 1701'' is part of the permanent collection of the Musée de la Pointe à Calliêres in Montreal.
https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/dAHiPWAkwoYx-A?projectId=art-project
he has been involved in his comunity and he is a well respected member.
one of his wish is to bring people together, so in order to do so we put together events here in Puerto Morelos where the North (being represented by the Blue Wolf) meet the South (being represented by the Jaguar) while this takes place where visitors from all over the world can participate as well.  and we are looking forward to organize more of these events, where a group of elders from the North would come here and share their cultures and traditions with those living here.
he also enjoys transmitting his knowledge of painting to the youth, he has done so in the past and still is doing it.  the next project is teaching teenagers from Puerto Morelos on how to paint murals.  this will take place in October 2015 at the local library. The project is called ''Dale Voz a la Pared''. we are planning a campaing for it on indigogo life... please check it out!
this is only one of my dreams, to know more, please go to the perks and let's have some coffee!!
we both are concerned about the environment on Mother Earth and the changes that are ocurring which are endangering our future and the one of our children.  we both think that self-respect will bring respect to others.  we both participate and/or organize events supporting the culture, art, youth, environment. we both enjoy nature, people, cultural exchanges,  and simple life!
the video that you are able to see here, is one for you to enjoy a little bit of what we enjoy living.... the image is not so great, but hey i work with what i have available, a regular old school Kodak camera!!!
thank you for your time and support!!! Light, Love and Peace to us All !!
a few pictures to get to know us.....

It does not matter if you are using your own car, public transportation or taxi services. All these different transportation modes have unavoidable drawbacks: delays, traffic jams, and pricing, just to name a few. This is why we started SEEMO.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">SEEMO stands for <b>s</b>ustainable, <b>e</b>fficient and <b>e</b>lectric <b>mo</b>bility and it is the revolution of public transportation. SEEMO combines the advantages of private vehicles with conventional public transportation systems and modern technology. It is public transportation on-demand.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456393181/gujmzuyestvid7t1nqey.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Compared to private vehicles, SEEMO is able to reduce emissions by up to 91%, traffic by 73% and cost by 44%. Not to mention a 100% reduction of stress and commuter rage.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454107988/ykongcug6izfx5euw0aa.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">And these are not the only advantages. SEEMO is environmentally friendly, efficient, economical, easy to use, good for your health, flexible, reliable and quiet. SEEMO means less smog, less contribution to global warming, fewer traffic jams, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, reduced noise pollution, no parking issues, and less emissions and particulate matter.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">SEEMO coordinates a fleet of electric vehicles, which are used to satisfy the travel needs of its users. New travel requests are dynamically integrated into existing routes using the latest optimization technologies. In this way it is possible to offer a transportation service which is not only environmental friendly and sustainable, but at the same time also flexible and efficient. These features are of great importance, but missing in most of the conventional public transportation services.</p>
<p>From the user point of view, SEEMO is extremely simple:</p>

That's all. At the desired departure time a bus will pick you up at your departure location. You then travel towards your destination, sharing the bus with other passengers who travel in the same direction. At the end, you exit the bus at your actual destination. No parking or walking required.</p>

<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">According to the World Health Organization, air pollution is now the world’s largest single environmental health risk.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Smog and ozone caused by traffic are a huge problem in many cities and metropolitan areas throughout the world.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">According to the European Environmental Agency, transportation in Europe in 2013 caused a total of 887 million tons of CO2 emission. That's 887,000,000,000 kg of CO2.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">People in Europe and the US are currently wasting on average 111 hours annually in traffic jams. [1]</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Traffic congestion currently cost drivers annually $1,740 on average across Germany, France, the UK and the US. The annual cost of gridlock to these countries is around $200 billion. That's $200,000,000,000. [1]</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">According to a study conducted by APCOA, finding a parking spot in Germany takes on average almost 10 minutes, and in Italy even up to 15 minutes. Additionally, on average each search for a parking spot requires 4.5 km of driving, leads to 1.3 kg of CO2 emission and costs 1.35 euro.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">According to several studies conducted between 1927 and 2001, <i>""on average 30 percent of the cars in congested downtown traffic were cruising for parking.""</i> [2]</li>
<li>Conventional public transportation is of no practical alternative. A recent study shows that <i>""71% of car users felt that public transport was not as convenient as a car, 72% said that a lack of connections was a problem, 64% mentioned a low frequency of services and 54% said they did not use public transport because it was not reliable.""</i> [3]</li>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The ultimate goal of this campaign is to realize the SEEMO public transportation service as a pilot project in a carefully selected city. An integral part of this endeavor will be the development of a complex and sophisticated software system. This system consists of three main components:</p>
<ol>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">
<b>Core System</b>: is responsible for the coordination of the vehicles and manages the interactions between the users and the SEEMO system.<br/>
</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">
<b>User Application</b>: allows the user to book trips and provides real-time trip information and statistics.<br/>
</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">
<b>Driver Application</b>: displays routing and customer information, provided by the <b>Core System</b>.<br/>
</li>
</ol>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">For the development we would like to form a small development team of skilled software engineers which share our vision. Our tentative schedule looks as follows:</p>
<p></p>

<li style=""text-align: justify;"">
<b>Milestone 1</b>: Simulation of the Core System using real-world map and traffic data and the integration of the User Application with the Core System.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">
<b>Milestone 2</b>: Integration of the Driver Application with the Core System.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The main difficulty of this project is the actual realization of a pilot project in a carefully selected city. This part of the project requires the support of cities and communities and might even involve other parties. We are aware of the fact that we will face multiple uncertainties. But we are also confident that we will successfully deal with all the upcoming issues.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:20px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452240337/nstbrasezculfs2o6lod.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">SEEMO is a revolutionary transportation service and a vision for a better world. We believe that helping our environment and improving our health is the duty of all of us. Making this world a better place and providing a convenient, ethical and affordable transportation service are both extremely strong incentives to support this campaign.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We also provide special perks for everyone who supports us at this early stage of the project and who shares our vision of a better world.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>The most spectacular perk is the ""SEEMO unlimited lifetime perk"". Claiming this awesome perk allows you to use any transportation service that will be based on SEEMO</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>free of charge,</b></li>
<li><b>in the whole world,</b></li>
<li><b>for your whole lifetime!<br/></b></li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In addition, we offer a variety of perks directly expressing our gratitude for your support, including a list of supporters on our website, stickers and certificates. Furthermore, we offer several perks which can be used for any transportation service throughout the whole world that will be based on SEEMO.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Finally, there is also a limited amount of plates, displaying the names of supporters or supporting companies, available. These plates are placed on the vehicles used throughout the pilot project.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom:20px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452240304/pbkircpirkm6xnzqpogs.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We already mentioned that we have conducted extensive research about on-demand transportation services during the last years. Our consistently positive results were the basis for the development of SEEMO. The results we presented earlier are only a very small excerpt of our comprehensive studies. For more information about our scientific work please contact us at <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dennis_Weyland"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ResearchGate</a>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Currently we are focusing on a traffic simulation using real-world map data. This simulation is used for the comparison of SEEMO with other modes of transportation in a realistic setting. Several performance indicators such as travel times, costs, emissions, responsiveness and scalability are measured. These indicators are extremely valuable during the planning phase of a SEEMO project.</p>

Deutsche Version  



Let's be honest: getting around the city can be really annoying. It does not matter if you are using your own car, public transportation or taxi services. All these different transportation modes have unavoidable drawbacks: delays, traffic jams, and pricing, just to name a few. This is why we started SEEMO.
SEEMO stands for sustainable, efficient and electric mobility and it is the revolution of public transportation. SEEMO combines the advantages of private vehicles with conventional public transportation systems and modern technology. It is public transportation on-demand.
Compared to private vehicles, SEEMO is able to reduce emissions by up to 91%, traffic by 73% and cost by 44%. Not to mention a 100% reduction of stress and commuter rage.
And these are not the only advantages. SEEMO is environmentally friendly, efficient, economical, easy to use, good for your health, flexible, reliable and quiet. SEEMO means less smog, less contribution to global warming, fewer traffic jams, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, reduced noise pollution, no parking issues, and less emissions and particulate matter.


SEEMO coordinates a fleet of electric vehicles, which are used to satisfy the travel needs of its users. New travel requests are dynamically integrated into existing routes using the latest optimization technologies. In this way it is possible to offer a transportation service which is not only environmental friendly and sustainable, but at the same time also flexible and efficient. These features are of great importance, but missing in most of the conventional public transportation services.
From the user point of view, SEEMO is extremely simple:
Using the SEEMO app, you just have to select your desired departure time, your departure location and your destination. That's all. At the desired departure time a bus will pick you up at your departure location. You then travel towards your destination, sharing the bus with other passengers who travel in the same direction. At the end, you exit the bus at your actual destination. No parking or walking required.



According to the World Health Organization, air pollution is now the world’s largest single environmental health risk.
Smog and ozone caused by traffic are a huge problem in many cities and metropolitan areas throughout the world.
According to the European Environmental Agency, transportation in Europe in 2013 caused a total of 887 million tons of CO2 emission. That's 887,000,000,000 kg of CO2.
People in Europe and the US are currently wasting on average 111 hours annually in traffic jams. [1]
Traffic congestion currently cost drivers annually $1,740 on average across Germany, France, the UK and the US. The annual cost of gridlock to these countries is around $200 billion. That's $200,000,000,000. [1]
According to a study conducted by APCOA, finding a parking spot in Germany takes on average almost 10 minutes, and in Italy even up to 15 minutes. Additionally, on average each search for a parking spot requires 4.5 km of driving, leads to 1.3 kg of CO2 emission and costs 1.35 euro.
According to several studies conducted between 1927 and 2001, ""on average 30 percent of the cars in congested downtown traffic were cruising for parking."" [2]
Conventional public transportation is of no practical alternative. A recent study shows that ""71% of car users felt that public transport was not as convenient as a car, 72% said that a lack of connections was a problem, 64% mentioned a low frequency of services and 54% said they did not use public transport because it was not reliable."" [3]



The ultimate goal of this campaign is to realize the SEEMO public transportation service as a pilot project in a carefully selected city. An integral part of this endeavor will be the development of a complex and sophisticated software system. This system consists of three main components:


Core System: is responsible for the coordination of the vehicles and manages the interactions between the users and the SEEMO system.


User Application: allows the user to book trips and provides real-time trip information and statistics.


Driver Application: displays routing and customer information, provided by the Core System.


For the development we would like to form a small development team of skilled software engineers which share our vision. Our tentative schedule looks as follows:



Milestone 1: Simulation of the Core System using real-world map and traffic data and the integration of the User Application with the Core System.

Milestone 2: Integration of the Driver Application with the Core System.

The main difficulty of this project is the actual realization of a pilot project in a carefully selected city. This part of the project requires the support of cities and communities and might even involve other parties. We are aware of the fact that we will face multiple uncertainties. But we are also confident that we will successfully deal with all the upcoming issues.


SEEMO is a revolutionary transportation service and a vision for a better world. We believe that helping our environment and improving our health is the duty of all of us. Making this world a better place and providing a convenient, ethical and affordable transportation service are both extremely strong incentives to support this campaign.
We also provide special perks for everyone who supports us at this early stage of the project and who shares our vision of a better world.
The most spectacular perk is the ""SEEMO unlimited lifetime perk"". Claiming this awesome perk allows you to use any transportation service that will be based on SEEMO

free of charge,
in the whole world,
for your whole lifetime!

In addition, we offer a variety of perks directly expressing our gratitude for your support, including a list of supporters on our website, stickers and certificates. Furthermore, we offer several perks which can be used for any transportation service throughout the whole world that will be based on SEEMO.
Finally, there is also a limited amount of plates, displaying the names of supporters or supporting companies, available. These plates are placed on the vehicles used throughout the pilot project.


We already mentioned that we have conducted extensive research about on-demand transportation services during the last years. Our consistently positive results were the basis for the development of SEEMO. The results we presented earlier are only a very small excerpt of our comprehensive studies. For more information about our scientific work please contact us at ResearchGate.
Currently we are focusing on a traffic simulation using real-world map data. This simulation is used for the comparison of SEEMO with other modes of transportation in a realistic setting. Several performance indicators such as travel times, costs, emissions, responsiveness and scalability are measured. These indicators are extremely valuable during the planning phase of a SEEMO project.

Mal im ernst: so richtig funktioniert der Nahverkehr in Städten doch nicht. Egal ob es das eigene Auto ist, der öffentliche Personennahverkehr oder Taxiunternehmen. All diese Transportmöglichkeiten haben schwerwiegende Nachteile: Verspätungen, Staus, Fahrpreise und noch viele weitere. Und aus diesem Grund haben wir SEEMO gestartet.
SEEMO steht für nachhaltige, effiziente und elektrische Mobilität und ist die Revolution im öffentlichen Personennahverkehr. SEEMO kombiniert die Vorteile des Individualverkehrs mit dem öffentlichen Personennahverkehr und modernen Technologien. Es ist öffentlicher Nahverkehr nach Bedarf.
Gegenüber privaten Autos könnten mit SEEMO Emissionen um bis zu 91%, Verkehr um 73% und Kosten um 44% verringert werden. Dazu kommt noch eine Reduktion von Stress und Wut im öffentlichen Nahverkehr um 100%.
Und hierbei handelt es sich nicht um die einzigen Vorteile. SEEMO ist umweltfreundlich, effizient, günstig, einfach zu benutzen, gesund, flexibel, zuverlässig und leise. SEEMO bedeutet weniger Smog, geringerer Beitrag zur globalen Erderwärmung, weniger Staus, verringerter Ausstoß von Treibhausgasen, weniger Verkehr, reduzierte Lärmbelästigung, keine Parkplatzsuche und weniger Feinstaub.

SEEMO koordiniert eine Flotte von elektrischen Fahrzeugen, welche die Transportbedürfnisse der Kunden abdeckt. Neue Fahrtwünsche werden mithilfe von modernsten Optimierungsmethoden dynamisch in die bestehenden Routen eingefügt. Das Resultat ist ein System für den öffentlichen Personennahverkehr, welches nicht nur umweltfreundlich und nachhaltig, sondern auch flexibel und effizient ist. Diese Eigenschaften sind extrem wichtig, fehlen aber in vielen herkömmlichen Transportsystemen.
Aus Benutzersicht funktioniert SEEMO wie folgt:
Um eine Fahrt zu buchen, muss in der SEEMO App lediglich die gewünschte Abfahrtszeit, der Startort und der Zielort eingeben werden. Das ist alles. Zur gewünschten Abfahrtszeit wird man von einem der Kleinbusse am Startort abgeholt. Auf dem Weg zum Zielort steigen gelegentlich andere Fahrgäste, die in die gleiche Richtung unterwegs sind, ein oder aus. So kommt man einfach und unkompliziert zum Ziel, ohne lästige Parkplatzsuche und ohne jegliche Fußwege.


Laut Weltgesundheitsorganisation ist Luftverschmutzung weltweit das größte umweltbezogene Gesundheitsrisiko.
Verkehrsbedingter Smog und Ozon sind große Probleme in vielen Städten und Ballungsgebieten weltweit.
Gemäß Statistiken der Europäischen Umweltagentur wurden allein im Jahr 2013 durch Verkehr 887 Millionen Tonnen an CO2 Emission verursacht. Das sind 887.000.000.000 kg CO2.
Menschen in Europa und den USA verschwenden jährlich im Durchschnitt 111 Stunden in Staus. [1]
Stau und dichter Verkehr kosten Autofahrern in Deutschland, Frankreich, Großbrittanien und den USA im Durchschnitt jährlich 1.740 Dollar. Die Gesamtkosten in diesen Ländern betragen jährlich 200 Milliarden Dollar. Das sind 200.000.000.000 Dollar. [1]
Gemäß einer Studie der APCOA, dauert es in Deutschland im Durchschnitt fast 10 Minuten um einen Parkplatz zu finden, in Italien sind es sogar bis zu 15 Minuten. Zusätzlich verursacht jede Parkplatzsuche im Durchschnitt Mehrfahrten von 4,5 km, CO2 Emissionen von 1,3 kg und Kosten von 1,35 Euro.
Laut mehrerer Studien zwischen 1927 und 2001 sind ""im Durchschnitt 30% der Autos in dichtem Stadtverkehr auf Parkplatzsuche. [2]
Herkömmlicher öffentlicher Personennahverkehr ist keine praktische Alternative. Eine aktuelle Studie zeigt: ""71% der Fahrer halten öffentlichen Nahverkehr für weniger komfortabel als das private Auto, 72% geben an, dass ein Mangel an Verbindungen ein Problem darstellt, 64% erwähnen die geringe Frequenz und 54% geben an, dass sie den öffentlichen Nahverkehr nicht nutzen, weil dieser nicht zuverlässig ist."" [3]


Das große Ziel dieser Kampagne ist, SEEMO in einer sorgfältig ausgewählten Stadt als Pilotprojekt zu realisieren. Ein wichtiger Bestandteil hierbei ist die Entwicklung eines komplexen Softwaresystems. Dieses System besteht im wesentlichen aus drei Komponenten:


Hauptsystem: ist zuständig für die Koordination der Fahrzeug-Flotte sowie für die  Interaktionen zwischen den Nutzern, Fahrern und dem SEEMO System.


Nutzer App: diese App ermöglicht das Buchen von Fahrten und stellt in Echtzeit Informationen und Statistiken zu Fahrten bereit.


Fahrer App: diese App stellt für den Fahrer sowohl Routen- als Nutzerinformationen (wer der nächste Kunde ist) dar, die vom Hauptsystem zur Verfügung gestellt werden. 


Für die Entwicklung würden wir gerne ein kleines Team von talentierten Softwareentwicklern aufstellen. Der vorläufige Projektplan sieht wie folgt aus:



Milestone 1: die Nutzer App wird in das Hauptsystem (Core System) integriert. Das Hauptsystem arbeitet hierbei mit realen Karten-  und Verkehrsdaten.


Milestone 2: die Fahrer App wird in das Hauptsystem integriert.

Eine Herausforderung bei diesem Projektes wird die Integration von SEEMO in die Praxis darstellen. Hierbei werden wir die Unterstützung von Städten, Gemeinden und weiteren Gruppen benötigen. Wir sind uns bewusst, dass wir mit vielen Unsicherheiten rechnen müssen. Aber wir sind auch zuversichtlich, dass wir diese Herausforderungen erfolgreich bewältigen werden.

SEEMO ist ein revolutionäres System für den öffentlichen Nahverkehr mit vielen Vorteilen für uns und unsere Umwelt. Wir glauben, dass es die Pflicht von uns allen ist, diese Vorteile auszuschöpfen. Die Welt zu verbessern und gleichzeitig noch ein komfortables, umweltfreundliches und ethisch vertretbares Transportsystem zu realisieren sind zwei sehr starke Anreize, um diese Kampagne zu unterstützen.
Zusätzlich stellen wir auch noch verschiedene Vergütungen (Perks) für all diejenigen zur Verfügung, die unsere Vorstellung von einer besseren Welt teilen und uns schon in dieser frühen Phase des Projekts unterstützen.
Unser spannendster Perk ist der ""SEEMO unlimited lifetime perk"". Mit diesem Perk ist es möglich alle Transportsysteme, die jemals mit SEEMO realisiert werden wie folgt zu nutzen:

kostenfrei,
in der ganzen Welt,
auf Lebenszeit!

Darüberhinaus bieten wir auch noch einige Perks an, durch die wir uns direkt bei unseren Unterstützern bedanken. Diese beinhalten eine Liste aller Unterstützer auf unserer Webseite, Sticker und Zertifikate. Desweiteren bieten wir auch noch zahlreiche Perks an, die für die Nutzung von Transportsystemen, die mit SEEMO realisiert werden, verwendet werden können.
Zu guter Letzt gibt es auch noch eine limitierte Anzahl an Fahrzeugplaketten, die den Namen des Unterstützers oder der unterstützenden Firma zeigen und welche gut lesbar auf den SEEMO Fahrzeugen im Pilotprojekt angebracht werden.

Wir haben bereits erwähnt, dass wir in den letzten Jahren verschiedene Forschungsprojekte über neuartige Systeme für den öffentlichen Nahverkehr durchgeführt haben. Die Ergebnisse, die wir weiter oben vorgestellt haben, sind lediglich ein kleiner Auszug aus unseren umfassenden Forschungsresultaten.

The Impact
 The performers involved in this project are dedicating their time because they believe in the conservation and retention of our valuable local resources.    By contributing, you will allow the ERA to return to focusing on their land restoration efforts, rather than focusing on cleaning up from this unfortunate disaster.  
 Similar projects that we've done in the past have served to present sites in a new light to community members who normally do not take advantage of the resource that is being showcased.  More people become aware of the programs the environmental non-profit offers, and shift their attitude towards the use of local resources in a positive manner.   This will be a joyful event that will build en even stronger community focused on the maintenance of the Eno River and its surrounding lands.

charcoal which when used as a cooking fuel emits large amounts of harmful

this campaign a reality. We think you will love it as much as we do.

HOW IT WORKSTHE REWARDSOur project will have a
great impact on the environment. Let’s do some
rough math!The average weight of a
eucalyptus tree used for industrial fuel: 1.6 tonnes Daily output of biomass
briquettes: 50 metric tonesEquivalent trees saved a
day: 50/1.6 = 31 trees In one year you can help us
save 11,406 trees!Women
and youth in Africa spend considerable amounts of time collecting firewood and
charcoal which when used as a cooking fuel emits large amounts of harmful
carbon monoxide gas. This can have serious long term health implications in the
affected communities. These implications are greatly reduced by the use of our
non-carbonized biomass briquettes. Mary,
a chicken brooder – “The briquettes are an eco-friendly way to keep my chicks
warm.”Boniface,
A charcoal dealer – “Many customers are switching to this alternative. Can we
get more to stock?”Mama
Kiosk, an outdoor restaurant owner – “I use them at my small restaurant; they
save me money and last much longer than charcoal.”Our
product is safe and natural and has no additives.THE ORIGIN STORYAllan
Marega, started this project in 2008 after the need to conserve the environment
bit him, years later more members flocked in. Although he was a well-trained
Airline Pilot, he hanged his boots and did a lengthy research on use of biomass
fuels.Over
the next few years, the briquette project has slowly picked momentum although
the crowd funding campaign has been…(we need your help) now that it has come to
our attention that people like doing what they know or should we say our (read
Africans)quest for knowledge is wanting!We
have struggled with this project alot. Our goal of conserving the environment is
playing Truth or Dare.Our Project goal was broken down into three stages and we need
your help on the second phase.PHASE I: Phase  Cost: USD 1,200,000 Funds Raised:  USD 1,200,000
Key Activities

  - Identify feedstock and do testing (completed)



  - locate a suitable area for the plant (completed)



  - Build the plant ( completed)



  - Design and manufacture of the machinery (completed)



   -Installing the machinery (pending)

 PHASE II : Phase Cost: USD 50,000 : Funds Needed: USD 50,000
Key Activities

- Begin production( pending)

- Establish Distribution  
 - Establish a market presence


 - Maintain clientele


PHASE III:  Phase Cost: USD 1,800,000 : Funds Needed: USD 1,800,000
Key Activities


  Increase the size of the plant to handle
double the output

There will be a future round of fundraising for this phase.

SUPPORT THIS CAMPAIGN
We found our niche and began from
there. We have put this project on social media and websites because it’s the
fastest way to get this crowd funding campaign into your hands.
Our main aim was to create awareness,
educate, fundraise and make improvements as a community. We think this crowd
funding campaign is great but we need your help in making it even better.
So, if you like to reduce carbon
emissions in the environment and bring about economic empowerment please back this
project and help make the world a better place.
If everyone swept before their heels,
then Africa would be a better place.
Let’s get involved. We need each other.

</div><h3><br/></h3></div>","El proyecto Bogotá Biodiversa surge de la necesidad de generar información científica de calidad aunada a procesos de comunicación, apropiación y divulgación para el rescate de los valores urbanos asociados a la biodiversidad bogotana.
Nuestro proyecto inicia de forma preliminar en diciembre de 2012 cuando un
grupo de residentes de los cerros orientales en colaboración con ProCAT inician
un muestreo exploratorio de fauna a partir de las observaciones locales de algunos felinos inusuales. 

Luego de dos meses de muestreos preliminares, los resultados fueron sorprendentes; detectamos la presencia del tigrillo lanudo el cusumbo
de montaña, la guagua de montaña, la chucha de montaña, entre otras especies
que no se creían aún habitaran en las inmediaciones de nuestra ciudad capital.

 A PARTIR DE ESTE PRIMER ACERCAMIENTO SURGE LA IDEA DE BOGOTA BIODIVERSA!!!
Como un
proyecto que englobe procesos de investigación aplicados a la conservación para
las zonas urbanas y periurbanas de Bogotá, enfatizando la necesidad de educar,
concientizar, empoderar y visibilizar la vida silvestre con la que habitamos y su
relación con los habitantes capitalinos.  DESCRIPCIÓN DE PROYECTOBogotá Biodiversa



Rescatando nuestro lado silvestre, empoderando nuestra naturaleza








Misión








Rescatar los valores asociados a la biodiversidad, en especial la vida silvestre de
las zonas urbanas y periurbanas de Bogotá como mecanismo de sensibilización,
rescate del sentido de pertenencia y conservación de la biodiversidad, generando
actividades de investigación, educación, y apropiación para el mejoramiento de
las condiciones de la vida silvestre en la ciudad, se promueva el mantenimiento
y mejoramiento en la provisión de bienes y servicios ambientales de la biodiver-
sidad y se logre un desarrollo urbano de la mano de la conservación de la biodi-
versidad, la sostenibilidad y el mejoramiento del entorno ambiental de la ciudad.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Trying to go waste-free in 2018 London is still a daily challenge but we are convinced it doesn’t have to be. With <strong><a href=""https://www.thezeroshop.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Zéro</i>,</a></strong> we want to make it easy for everyone to embark on the Zero Waste journey. Our shop will offer a simple alternative to excessive single-use packaging consumption with a wide range of ready-to-go bulk items. We want people to consider our shop as an alternative to supermarkets where they can source local, organic and FairTrade products without the unnecessary packaging.</p>
<p>With our passion for environmental issues and our combined experience in sales and retail (Josh) and business operations and finance (Alicia), we are convinced we have the knowledge and skills necessary to make Zéro a successful venture. </p>
<p>By funding this project, you will make it possible for Zéro to become Londoners’ new favourite grocery shop and give us the first push to make this happen. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need your help to raise at least <strong>£20,000</strong> to cover the initial investment, including shop set-up and initial inventory. To keep the business stocked up for the first 3 months we will need around £11,200 and extra £8,800 will be used to refurbish the shop and acquire the food dispensers (gravity dispensers, jars, scoops etc.). </p>
<p>We have some amazing perks available! Discounts, Zero Waste shopping kits, special mentions on our shop ‘thank you’ mural, VIP launch invites… you name it! All Zero Waste, of course. </p>
<p>If we don't reach the entire goal, the funds will go in priority towards the initial inventory as having great quality products is of paramount importance to us. The rest will be invested in the premises and equipment (possibly with a bank loan). </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Zero Waste shops offer a sustainable shopping option to mindful customers who are not satisfied with the current standards of the food retail industry. They are the answer to the increasing demand for more sustainable practices in supermarkets and local food stores and present a satisfying alternative for grocery shopping. </p>
<p>For many products, zero packaging represents a perfectly viable and more sustainable packaging solution than plastic. Many fresh foods are naturally wrapped in their own skin and, under the right conditions, can be safely transported and consumed without single-use plastic packaging. Traditional farmers’ markets are common across Europe and in particular across the UK, many of which operate with low levels of packaging, selling fruits and vegetables loose, and meat and dairy products in paper. As well as traditional markets, a growing number of European food retailers are now renouncing packaging. Just like traditional grocery shops, package-free, or ‘Zero Waste’ shops sell loose produce and promote the use of reusable containers.</p>
<p>Beyond the obvious environmental benefits of cutting down the use of unwanted packaging, Zero Waste shops are also a great way to reduce food waste and to save on household expenses. By enabling their customers to purchase the exact quantity of goods they require, Zero Waste shopping makes it easier to tailor consumption to people’s real needs and to manage expenses. </p>
<p>In a nutshell, Zero Waste shops bring the perfect solution to both the packaging and food waste issues that plague the food industry in Western countries. Over the last few years, such shops have been flourishing across Europe and the USA and consumers have welcomed very favourably these new shopping facilities which offer a sustainable alternative to slow-moving big retail chains. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Some of the risks and obstacles we may face on the way to achieving our goal and how we plan to overcome them: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Need to build a strong consumers basis</strong>: as a new independent shop, we will have to make ourselves known to the public, which might be challenging at the start. This will require a strong marketing strategy with a mix of impactful media content, and promotional events. </li>
<li>
<strong>Need to educate the consumer</strong>: As the concept of Zero Waste shops is still new, there will be an important educational effort to make to explain the idea and the way the shop works to the public. According to a study from Euromonitor, “the main barriers to buying green products are availability and knowledge” (2013). We have started to write a <a href=""https://www.thezeroshop.com/blog"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">blog</a> (available on our website) to write about the zero waste lifestyle and the shop.

<h3>What's the big deal?</h3>
<p>Plastic is pollution from the moment it is made. It has been documented from the depths of the ocean floor, to the height of Mt. Everest, and in lakes, streams, rivers, storm drains, wetlands, arctic sea ice, beaches, oceans, tap water, bottled water, in the air we breathe, in the intestines of all ocean life (from plankton to whales), sea birds, the fish on people's plates, and in the salt used to season it.</p>

<p>There is no recycling our way out of this: It's time to stop making, and buying disposable products, made out of materials that last forever.</p>
<p>Our focus on school supplies is precisely because of the prescriptive nature of Back-to-School shopping.  Students are issued long lists of forever-garbage supplies to purchase, with no place to turn for waste-free options. </p>

Plastic is pollution from the moment it is made. It has been documented from the depths of the ocean floor, to the height of Mt. Everest, and in lakes, streams, rivers, storm drains, wetlands, arctic sea ice, beaches, oceans, tap water, bottled water, in the air we breathe, in the intestines of all ocean life (from plankton to whales), sea birds, the fish on people's plates, and in the salt used to season it.

There is no recycling our way out of this: It's time to stop making, and buying disposable products, made out of materials that last forever.
Our focus on school supplies is precisely because of the prescriptive nature of Back-to-School shopping.  Students are issued long lists of forever-garbage supplies to purchase, with no place to turn for waste-free options. 
Until now.

We need your help.

</p>
<p>I am writing the book that I wanted to read as a child, a
book that would tell me where I am, and by extension who I am and what is my
place in the community of life. There are plenty of books that tell the tale of
local mineral development, how Syracuse flourished because of the salt trade
and the Erie Canal. But what about the biological wealth, the plants and
animals who lived here and whose stories have never been told? My Indiegogo project aims to tell that story
by recounting the historical ecology of Onondaga Lake, one of the most polluted
lakes in the nation.</p>
<p> <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">What was Onondaga Lake like before becoming a toxic
morass, and how did the indigenous people live equitably here with the land and

I am writing the book that I wanted to read as a child, a
book that would tell me where I am, and by extension who I am and what is my
place in the community of life. There are plenty of books that tell the tale of
local mineral development, how Syracuse flourished because of the salt trade
and the Erie Canal. But what about the biological wealth, the plants and
animals who lived here and whose stories have never been told? My Indiegogo project aims to tell that story
by recounting the historical ecology of Onondaga Lake, one of the most polluted
lakes in the nation.
 What was Onondaga Lake like before becoming a toxic
morass, and how did the indigenous people live equitably here with the land and
water? Onondaga Lake once teemed with life—salmon, eel, waterfowl,
rattlesnakes, orchids, passenger pigeons. The Lake today is a Superfund site
with 10 subsites; see http://www.onondagalake.org/ for details. This contrast between Onondaga Lakes present (severely degraded landscape) and past (epicenter of life) inspired me to
delve deeper into the past and piece together the Lake’s story.
  What We Need & What You Get  Donations will help pay my living expenses while I work on the book and bring it to a close, about 8 months Perks include original drawings of Lake flora and fauna by illustrator Stephanie Holmes and native plants from Nannyberry Nursery    The Impact  This book will fill a major gap in our understanding of place
Although details are specific to Onondaga Lake, the same story has occurred  wherever Superfund sites occur, and similar themes apply I have already developed a website that has material similar to what will appear in the book -- see http://onondagalakehistoricalecology.weebly.com/the-cultural-landscape-of-onondaga-lake.html
    Risks & Challenges  One challenge in a project such as this is finding the sources to answer my questions. Early settlers and visitors generally did not keep records on flora and fauna or the landscapes around them, for example. Also, the intensity of lake shore development has obliterated much biological or archaeological evidence over the years.  Despite these limits, I've learned to piece together a picture of the landscape from a number of different sources-- journals, archaeological records, county histories, florae for the area, etc-- combined with knowledge of species life history 
Another challenge is overwhelm-- so many sub-stories to tell here, so little time!  

To keep the project manageable, I focus my research on the plant communities, which are the foundation for the rest of life 
Also, I stop at 1825, the year the Erie Canal opened across NYS and ""all hell broke loose"" as far as settlement and industrial growth in the Syracuse area

<h3>Our Current Impact on the Community:</h3>
<p>Over the last 6 months we have been working to bring the Tiny House Movement to Cleveland. It hasn't always been easy but it has been a rewarding experience to have an impact on others and the Greater Cleveland community. We have started...</p>
<ul><li>
<p><b>The Greater Cleveland Tiny House Enthusiasts</b>. A group that now has 80+ members. It was formed to help connect others passionate about tiny houses, sustainable design and alternative living. Currently we are working together to help change zoning laws to make Tiny Houses a legal &amp; viable option in the Cleveland area. </p>

<p><b>Housing in India</b></p>
<p>India will have a higher population than China by 2022! A growing population creates demand for low cost social and responsive housing schemes, rapidly growing infrastructure facilities, amongst many other urban and rural amenities. Considering the scale of this requirement, the demand must be dealt with responsibly, taking into account the economies of scale, our environmental concerns, and HDI. HDI or Human Development Index is used to measure the quality of life in countries across the world, and is able to deeply reflect on the reality in particular countries. India at 0.609 has a long way to go to reach the minimum standards.</p>
<p>The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana launched by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2015 is a vision of Housing for All by the year 2022. The scheme comes with an aim of constructing more than 20 million houses across the length and breadth of the nation within a span of the next seven years. The implementation would be carried out in three sustainable phases till 2022.</p>

<p>Our concern is in regard to the enormous resource and energy consumption of the construction industry. The sector emits about 22 per cent of India’s total annual CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions. Using a minimum of 60% of bamboo as a construction material reduces emission by almost 10%! If there is a way to bring down the carbon emission, and reduce costs of construction, while at the same time making a successful attempt to raise India’s HDI, why not give this mission a fair chance to prove itself?

<p></p>
<p><b>Lake
Fúquene</b> is one of the <b>most important freshwater bodies </b>of the high altitude ecosystems
in the Northern Andes, located in Colombia in the Ubaté River Basin in a high
altitude tropical region. Five centuries of transformations have changed the
natural conditions (i.e. climate, hydrological pulses) of the lake and
associated wetlands, into a problematic human regulated irrigation district. The
catchment area of Lake Fúquene <b>has suffered an intensive process of
deforestation</b>, leaving only small fragments of native forest. Previous
reforestation efforts were made in the area during the 1980s, but the species
chosen were exotic and very damaging to the soil, increasing erosion. </p>
<p>Colombia’s
high Andean wetlands are particularly <b>vulnerable to climate change</b> and also essential
for the adaptation of many human communities to that phenomenon. Analysing Lake
Fúquene´s vulnerability to climate change, Franco <i>et al.</i> (2011)<b> recommended to</b> <b>restore a forest cover of at least 36%</b>
of the basin area in the next 20 years, to ensure the resilience of the
territory.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Following this rationale, <span>Fundación Humedales decided to seek your cooperation,
to contribute to the restoration <b>of 3
ha of native forest, in Fúquene.</b></span></p>

 The proposed site
for the restoration project, lies 600 meters away from the lake´s shore, near the
road that connects the small city of Ubaté and the town of Susa. The land is
covered in shrubs and patches of exotic species.  The soil is highly degraded and eroded in most of the land,
caused by the effects of the exotic species in the soil.

<p>In previous
years, Fundación Humedales installed a nursery, where <b>community members learned
to grow and care for native species</b> that were later used for reforestation
initiatives. We propose a project that consists of a planning phase, a nursery
development phase, a planting phase and an evaluation phase. Every one of
these, <b>includes a training workshop</b> aimed at instructing interested members of
the community in the skills necessary for engaging in forest restoration. We
expect <b>to reforest 3 ha with native species</b>, using the technique of vegetation
cores. We anticipate an<b> improvement in the
soil</b> following the planting of the seedlings in terms of water retention,
amount of organic matter and depth of the soil. Also, we hope for an <b>increase
in the amount and diversity of animal species visiting the new forest</b> and
better availability of water. The combination of this factors, will transform
the land, <b>preventing further erosion </b>and decreasing the chances of forest fires
in future drought periods.</p>
<ul></ul>
<h4><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Among the posible risks we face are:</span></h4>

Los humedales de alta montaña son especialmente vulnerables al cambio climático y también esenciales para la adaptación de las personas a este fenómeno. Por esta razón, Fundación Humedales busca su colaboración para contribuir en la restauración de 3 ha de bosque nativo en Fúquene.

Con su ayuda, podremos mejorar el suelo y crear nuevos hábitats para las especies de animales. Estos factores van a transformar  el área, previniendo la erosión y disminuyendo el riesgo de  incendios forestales en futuros años Niño.
Colombia’s high
Andean wetlands are particularly vulnerable
to climate change and also essential for the adaptation
of many human communities to that phenomenon. Following this rationale,
Fundación Humedales decided to seek your cooperation, to contribute to the
restoration of 3 ha of native forest, in Fúquene.
With your
help we will be able to improve the
soil and provide habitat
for animal species visiting
the new forest. The combination of this factors, will transform the land,preventing further erosion and decreasing the chances of forest fires in future drought periods.

THE FULL STORY... 


Lake
Fúquene is one of the most important freshwater bodies of the high altitude ecosystems
in the Northern Andes, located in Colombia in the Ubaté River Basin in a high
altitude tropical region. Five centuries of transformations have changed the
natural conditions (i.e. climate, hydrological pulses) of the lake and
associated wetlands, into a problematic human regulated irrigation district. The
catchment area of Lake Fúquene has suffered an intensive process of
deforestation, leaving only small fragments of native forest. Previous
reforestation efforts were made in the area during the 1980s, but the species
chosen were exotic and very damaging to the soil, increasing erosion. 
Colombia’s
high Andean wetlands are particularly vulnerable to climate change and also essential
for the adaptation of many human communities to that phenomenon. Analysing Lake
Fúquene´s vulnerability to climate change, Franco et al. (2011) recommended to restore a forest cover of at least 36%
of the basin area in the next 20 years, to ensure the resilience of the
territory.

Following this rationale, Fundación Humedales decided to seek your cooperation,
to contribute to the restoration of 3
ha of native forest, in Fúquene.

 The proposed site
for the restoration project, lies 600 meters away from the lake´s shore, near the
road that connects the small city of Ubaté and the town of Susa. The land is
covered in shrubs and patches of exotic species.  The soil is highly degraded and eroded in most of the land,
caused by the effects of the exotic species in the soil.

In previous
years, Fundación Humedales installed a nursery, where community members learned
to grow and care for native species that were later used for reforestation
initiatives. We propose a project that consists of a planning phase, a nursery
development phase, a planting phase and an evaluation phase. Every one of
these, includes a training workshop aimed at instructing interested members of
the community in the skills necessary for engaging in forest restoration. We
expect to reforest 3 ha with native species, using the technique of vegetation
cores. We anticipate an improvement in the
soil following the planting of the seedlings in terms of water retention,
amount of organic matter and depth of the soil. Also, we hope for an increase
in the amount and diversity of animal species visiting the new forest and
better availability of water. The combination of this factors, will transform
the land, preventing further erosion and decreasing the chances of forest fires
in future drought periods.

Among the posible risks we face are:

A low attendance of community members to the training workshops.
Delays caused by the climate (Planting during drought is not an option!)

</div><p>Now we'll build a new ship – the very first full-scale replica of the legendary record-breaking 19th century tea and wool Clipper Ship, the Cutty Sark.  Back in those days, the Clipper sailed around the globe, carrying precious cargo. On her journeys, all she needed was the wind to sail, and the stars to steer her by.  She was sleek and refined, the pinnacle of the Great Age of Sail. Her builders spared no expense, she was speed personified - she was perfection.<br/></p><div>
</div><p>The new Cutty Sark will sail the historic routes to China, Australia, North &amp; South America - carrying traditional cargoes (tea, coffee, wool) across the Globe. Anyone wishing for an amazing and life-changing experience will be able to join the crew as a trainee.</p><div>

<h4>The experience:</h4>
<p>You will have a lot of fun - meet new friends,
experience team spirit, learn new skills.  And this could be your secret
escape route from the fast pace of modern living.</p>
<p><b>The challenge:</b></p>
<p>You can challenge yourself by doing what
you've never done before:  go to a rainforest to get some timber for the
ship; help lay the keel or fit a plank; prepare a meal for 30+ hungry
volunteer shipbuilders; dance on the deck of the ship before she is launched;
stitch a sail and set it up to a yard...</p>
<h4>The reward:</h4>
<p>Satisfaction
- you've supported the Cutty Sark 2Sail Project today, and you will always have the
satisfaction of knowing that you’ve helped to bring back the glorious Great Age
of Sail.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<h4>Design:</h4>
<p>This is where
we shall start.  It will take three months to produce the drawings. Three
months to get approvals. Then six months to secure funding. One year altogether. <b>We shall start the design work no later than February the 1st, 2016</b></p>
<p><b>Construction:</b></p>
<p>The original
Cutty Sark was built in 11 months. Our ancestors have set us a challenge - can
we do it as fast as they did? Realistically, it might take two or even three
times longer. To complete the ship in time, we plan to start construction no later than February 1<sup>st</sup>, 2017.</p>
<h4>Launch date:</h4>

The original Cutty Sark was launched on 22<sup>nd</sup> November 1869. It would be
remarkable if the launching of the new Cutty Sark could happen on the 150th
Anniversary of the original launch:<b> 22<sup>nd</sup> November 2019.</b>

<div></div>
<p>For the first stage to succeed – making the detailed design – the Cutty Sark2sail Foundation is challenged to collect
105,000 Euro (around 120,000 USD).</p>
<p>The total cost: We will
know the exact total budget of the whole project after all the calculations
and drawings are made. It
might come to anything between 12 to <span>24M Euro</span>. Sounds
like a lot of money, eh?</p>
<p>There are two pieces of
good news:<br/>
1. We don't need all that money at once.  ""<i>Nothing is particularly
hard if you divide it into small jobs.""  ~Henry Ford. </i></p>

2. By experience we know that if we do
the job properly, money will come when we need it: ""W<i>hen one
serves for the sake of service--for the satisfaction of doing that which
one believes to be right – then money abundantly takes care of
itself. Money comes naturally as the result of service."" ~Henry Ford</i><div>

<p>The new ship will be as ecologically clean as
possible. A stunningly magnificent vessel carrying out her work in a good,
clean, traditional way, powered only by wind and sails.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the exhaust from cargo ships contributes
enormously to the pollution of our Oceans. We want to stop the ongoing
destruction of our Planet. Together we can make a difference!</p>
<p>Cutty Sark 2 will serve as an ambassador for the
ecologically sound future which we envisage.</p>
<p>Sailing around the globe,
transporting
cargo, she will attract great attention and will serve as a reminder
that we should consider sustainable energy alternatives for travel, trade and
transportation. </p>
<p>She will serve as a shining example to all that sail
power is a viable means of sea transport. With your help, we will make her a
success! We will make a difference!</p>

<h4>Does the original ship still exist?</h4>
Yes. The original ship has been preserved.  She is
now used as a museum,
docked in Greenwich, London.  She is motionless now, although she seems to float upon air and glass ... she can no longer sail the seven seas.  That is why we want to build an exact copy - of the same size, of the same materials and, almost, with the same technology.<br/>
<p></p>
<p>The Cutty Sark 2 will once again carry her spirit around the world. <br/></p>

<p>The original Cutty Sark was built in Dumbarton, in 1869 for the China tea trade.</p>
<p>Cutty Sark‍’s well known race against
Thermopylae took place in 1872, the two ships leaving Shanghai together on 18<sup>th</sup> June. Two weeks later Cutty Sark had built up a lead of some 400 nautical
miles, when she lost her rudder in a severe gale. The ship's carpenter took six
days to construct a new rudder, working in gales and heavy seas. This happened
twice during the same voyage. The ship arrived in London on 18<sup>th</sup> October a week
after Thermopylae, and was awarded the prize for first ship home, in spite of
being a week behind Thermopylae.</p>
<p>In 1885, the ship’s owner, Jock Willis
(white hat Willis), hired an excellent and eccentric captain named Richard
Woodget to sail the ship in the Australian wool trade.</p>
<p>In this arena the Cutty Sark once again
excelled, setting speed records between London and  Australia. For a decade she established herself
 through record breaking voyages, but in
1895 Willis sold her to the Portuguese. Renamed Ferreira, she served under the
Portuguese Flag until 1923 when she was purchased by Wilfred Dowman, for use as a
sail training ship.</p>
<p>The old ship has now been
restored and looks beautiful, but will never go to sea again. She rests in her
own dry dock in Greenwich, London.</p>
<i><b>It’s now time to build a
replica to sail the seven seas once more, as an ambassador to The Great Age of
Sail and as a working memorial to the men who sailed in these fantastic ships.</b></i>

<p>At this first stage, we need to find the best way to build the sailing clipper – preserving all the historic details, and satisfying modern safety and ecological requirements. It is not an easy task – most sailing ships experience difficulties nowadays, dealing with more and more complicated regulations, invented for large steel motor vessels.  We will employ the most experienced naval architects to produce top quality, detailed calculations and to prove that classical sailing ships have rights to exist today – without compromising safety.</p>
<div>
</div>
<p>It is also important to note that this work is necessary and will be extremely useful for all working sailing ships, developing the level of understanding between sail training ships and international maritime authorities.</p></span><p></p>

<h4><b>If the new ship is a replica, why do we need to produce a new design?</b></h4>
<p></p>
<p>The world has changed. Safety standards are different. What was normal sailing practice 150 years ago is not acceptable today.</p>
<p>To achieve the latest safety standards, it will be necessary to rearrange some internal details in the ship. For example: some machinery space is required for generators to provide power – for safety equipment that we are obliged to include, and things like a fridge and a freezer; domestic fresh, grey and black water purification systems will also be required; lifesaving equipment, including life rafts and specially designed small tug-boats which regulations demand be carried on board … and don’t forget the requisite launching equipment or the advanced anchor system - with extra anchors at the stern – which must all be designed and placed in a “concealed” fashion so they don't detract from the aesthetic integrity of a 19th century vessel.</p>
<p>The main hull, masts, spars, rigging and all operating aspects will be unchanged from those of the original ship. The new Cutty Sark will have modern equipment on board, everything to provide her with the highest levels of safety. And she has to be built as a pure sailing ship which is environmentally friendly and sound. </p>
<p>These modern additions will be carefully placed so that they will not disrupt the historical integrity of the original clipper.</p>
<p><b>Where does the money go if this crowdfunding campaign is not
successful?</b></p>
<p>The
Cutty Sark2Sail Foundation retains the collected funds.<br/>Even if we do not
succeed in collecting sufficient money for the completion of the first project stage through this crowdfunding campaign, the donated money will still be used to start the
project.</p>
<p><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445715199/bf2b1iubeq0hkt3dfjnz.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The Cutty Sark2Sail Foundation retains this funding and will continue
raising funds from other sources until enough money has been raised to complete the first stage (design) and go on the following stages (construction, launching and putting out to sea). <p></p>
<p><b>Where does the estimated figure come from?<br/>Is
it a draft figure or an exact calculation?</b></p>
<p>The cost for the design work is 105,000 Euros (110,500$). That is the definite figure received as a firm quotation from
a company of professional naval
architects.  </p>
<p><b>What is total cost of building such ship <b>and how is it made
up</b>?</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>The total cost of the project of 19-26M Euros is an estimate, based on analysis of similar projects in Europe and other countries throughout the world. A full detailed budget <span>will be available after the
detailed design of the ship is complete.</span></p>
<p>The estimate consists of the following:</p>
<p>
120K €: Ship design and approvals<br/>
4M €: Site preparation and building viewing/accommodation facilities<br/>
880K €: Timber: Teak (130m3) + Rock Elm  (200m3) etc.<br/>
13M €: Labour<br/>
4M €: Equipment and tooling<br/>
4M €: Overheads and contingency<br/>
<b>Total: 26M </b><b>€</b>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><b>How will you raise this money</b>? </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>After completion of the design we
will be able to detail schedules and budgets. We will go to large companies
(like tea importing companies, wool producers, etc.) with proposals for
cooperation in the field of marketing their products using ecologically clean
transportation.</p>

We will also approach large TV companies, with proposals to create video productions of constructing and sailing Cutty Sark 2.  Additionally, we will be
approaching potential sponsors and donors, with a request to help in supporting the preservation of maritime
heritage and traditional skills.</div>
<div><b>What will happen if we don't collect the required amount? </b></div>
<div> We will simply try and try again, until we succeed.<i> </i><br/><p></p>
<p><b>To what extent will the ship be modified,
modernized?<br/>Will it still be historically accurate after the modification?</b></p>
<p>The plan will preserve ALL
visible parts of the ship in their true historical appearance. The way the ship is to be used will adhere to
traditional methods as much as possible. However, in the hold we will
hide <span>a modern power
unit to produce electricity </span>for state of the art navigation systems, and communication. All water &amp; sewage purification systems, as well as up
to date safety systems will also be included on board. We will make these modifications in such a way that people’s impression of Cutty Sark 2
as the original vessel will not be compromised. We have successful achieved this previously when
designing the frigate Shtandart.</p>
<p><b><b>Are there professionals
in the Cutty Sark 2Sail Team who have relevant knowledge/experience</b>?</b></p>
<p>We have people with considerable experience in building and
sailing traditional sailing ships. We also have team
members with marketing and project management expertise. We will enlist other professionals for the areas where
the team experience is lacking. Just to give you a glimpse:</p>
<p>Captain Vladimir Martus is a qualified
Naval Architect with deep sea sailing experience as a captain, and has Yacht Master
Instructor qualifications. He has built three large wooden replica
ships on his own and he has considerable
experience of the  most European
traditional sailing ships projects (Batavia, De Delft, Tenacious, Lord Nelson, HMS Trincomalee,
Gotheborg and Hermione).</p>
<p><b>Have you
carried out research; will Cutty Sark 2 be popular for sailing?</b></p>
<p>There is a definite demand for
ecological awareness and returning to our historical roots.</p>
<p>Cutty <span>Sark </span>2 is going to create an information flow to keep people aware <span>of good </span>alternatives regarding the reducion of pollution and CO2 emissions. She will regenerate the <span>skills and knowledge of past generation of
sailors. </span></p>
<p><span>The detailed research </span>on how much interest she will
attract is still on-going, but when we see the figures
of people attending maritime festivals, when we see queues of people waiting to visit traditional ships,
we think it is a definite sign that Cutty <span>Sark 2 </span>will have no difficulty in
attracting an audience and supporters.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Where will the new Cutty Sark be built?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>We have
considered several possible places, and are now preparing a detailed survey to finalise on the best location.
Priorities for defining the best place to settle our museum shipyard are: </p>
<p>1. We expect
the local
community to “adopt” the Cutty Sark 2Sail project as their own, with
friendly support on all levels: local authorities, construction and planning, tourism departments etc;  </p>
<p>2. Ideal place should have a potential for bringing in a lot
of visitors; </p>
<p>3. Preferably, it should be a nice and interesting place for volunteers to come and
spend 4-8 weeks helping to the project.  </p>
<p>4. Above all, it must be
technical possibilities to build the ship, launch her and take her to out to
sea.  </p>

The decision had not been made yet. We are in process of collecting
further information from many possible locations.<br/><br/>

Read the news about us: 







  





 



Welcome on board!Let’s work together to design, build and sail a magnificent replica of this most beautiful
19th century clipper ship - the Cutty Sark.


We would like to invite you to join our project to design, to build and (!)– to sail a replica of one of the most famous sailing ships the world has known - the tea clipper “Cutty Sark”
The CuttySark2Sail is about more than just building a ship; we intend to rediscover and save traditional skills and knowledge for future generations; to promote sail training and tall ships as environmentally friendly transport on the seas; to generate International friendship and trade.

THE CHALLENGE:
TO BUILD A HUGE WOODEN SAILING SHIP - working together with friends, with your own hands: isn't that a challenge to the modern world of computers and gadgets? We believe people should not forget about the good old ways of doing things. We are going for really hard work, in real world. We will bring back the Great Age of Sail. We'll make it real.
THE TASK:
We’ll
start with one ship at first: an authentic sailing cargo vessel, a new Cutty Sark. Our
dedicated and committed team are currently raising funds, to produce the ship's plans, and for the construction of this amazing ship. You are welcome to join the team.


YOUR HELP:
At this very first stage, we will employ the most skilful naval architects: we
have to integrate a safety
equipment into the historically accurate shape of the original ship. In modern world, it’s critically
important to have professionally made drawings, calculations and receive approvals before moving further with the construction. To produce this we are asking for your financial support, and your involvement


Let’s shape the future together: Experience the power of the wind and show the world how to use it to its
maximum effect! Revive the awesome skills of past generations and ensure
a future for the most ecological form of transportation known to mankind.


Tea-clipper Cutty Sark - design, history, future.

Now we'll build a new ship – the very first full-scale replica of the legendary record-breaking 19th century tea and wool Clipper Ship, the Cutty Sark.  Back in those days, the Clipper sailed around the globe, carrying precious cargo. On her journeys, all she needed was the wind to sail, and the stars to steer her by.  She was sleek and refined, the pinnacle of the Great Age of Sail. Her builders spared no expense, she was speed personified - she was perfection.
The new Cutty Sark will sail the historic routes to China, Australia, North & South America - carrying traditional cargoes (tea, coffee, wool) across the Globe. Anyone wishing for an amazing and life-changing experience will be able to join the crew as a trainee.


Just imagine, you're standing on the warm wooden deck of the most beautiful and elegant sailing ship ever built. You see the curious crowd assembled to get a glimpse  of the Cutty Sark 2 departing on her maiden voyage. This is like standing in the middle of a major movie set. You feel the mild breeze and the sunshine gently warming your skin. Your chest swells with pride because you know it was your efforts that helped to make sure it all happened. The sails begin to catch the wind, shaking the very fibres of your soul as you begin YOUR epic journey.



This is where the true adventure starts – this is where you belong.Welcome back to the future!





 Please make you contribution to help move things forward.

Tell everyone about this wonderful Dream in your social media pages.

This is your privilege, and it is our honour to have you in The Cutty Sark Family.






The experience:
You will have a lot of fun - meet new friends,
experience team spirit, learn new skills.  And this could be your secret
escape route from the fast pace of modern living.
The challenge:
You can challenge yourself by doing what
you've never done before:  go to a rainforest to get some timber for the
ship; help lay the keel or fit a plank; prepare a meal for 30+ hungry
volunteer shipbuilders; dance on the deck of the ship before she is launched;
stitch a sail and set it up to a yard...
The reward:
Satisfaction
- you've supported the Cutty Sark 2Sail Project today, and you will always have the
satisfaction of knowing that you’ve helped to bring back the glorious Great Age
of Sail.

Now it’s time for us to thank you, please take
a look at our ideas for rewards: 









Some years ago, we've got together as a team, and built a replica of the 1703 frigate Shtandart, the first ship of the Peter the Great's Russian Navy.

It was an absolutely life-changing experience – working together as a professional team, being together as a family. Learning new skills, and showing others what can be achieved. The result is an amazing ship, and the freedom to sail wherever we want. A new life which we made ourselves!

Design:
This is where
we shall start.  It will take three months to produce the drawings. Three
months to get approvals. Then six months to secure funding. One year altogether. We shall start the design work no later than February the 1st, 2016
Construction:
The original
Cutty Sark was built in 11 months. Our ancestors have set us a challenge - can
we do it as fast as they did? Realistically, it might take two or even three
times longer. To complete the ship in time, we plan to start construction no later than February 1st, 2017.
Launch date:

The original Cutty Sark was launched on 22nd November 1869. It would be
remarkable if the launching of the new Cutty Sark could happen on the 150th
Anniversary of the original launch: 22nd November 2019.







For the first stage to succeed – making the detailed design – the Cutty Sark2sail Foundation is challenged to collect
105,000 Euro (around 120,000 USD).
The total cost: We will
know the exact total budget of the whole project after all the calculations
and drawings are made. It
might come to anything between 12 to 24M Euro. Sounds
like a lot of money, eh?
There are two pieces of
good news:
1. We don't need all that money at once.  ""Nothing is particularly
hard if you divide it into small jobs.""  ~Henry Ford. 

2. By experience we know that if we do
the job properly, money will come when we need it: ""When one
serves for the sake of service--for the satisfaction of doing that which
one believes to be right – then money abundantly takes care of
itself. Money comes naturally as the result of service."" ~Henry Ford












Clean.
Green. A wonder to be seen!  



The new ship will be as ecologically clean as
possible. A stunningly magnificent vessel carrying out her work in a good,
clean, traditional way, powered only by wind and sails.
Nowadays, the exhaust from cargo ships contributes
enormously to the pollution of our Oceans. We want to stop the ongoing
destruction of our Planet. Together we can make a difference!
Cutty Sark 2 will serve as an ambassador for the
ecologically sound future which we envisage.
Sailing around the globe,
transporting
cargo, she will attract great attention and will serve as a reminder
that we should consider sustainable energy alternatives for travel, trade and
transportation. 
She will serve as a shining example to all that sail
power is a viable means of sea transport. With your help, we will make her a
success! We will make a difference!





Does the original ship still exist?
Yes. The original ship has been preserved.  She is
now used as a museum,
docked in Greenwich, London.  She is motionless now, although she seems to float upon air and glass ... she can no longer sail the seven seas.  That is why we want to build an exact copy - of the same size, of the same materials and, almost, with the same technology.

The Cutty Sark 2 will once again carry her spirit around the world.

The original Cutty Sark was built in Dumbarton, in 1869 for the China tea trade.
Cutty Sark‍’s well known race against
Thermopylae took place in 1872, the two ships leaving Shanghai together on 18th June. Two weeks later Cutty Sark had built up a lead of some 400 nautical
miles, when she lost her rudder in a severe gale. The ship's carpenter took six
days to construct a new rudder, working in gales and heavy seas. This happened
twice during the same voyage. The ship arrived in London on 18th October a week
after Thermopylae, and was awarded the prize for first ship home, in spite of
being a week behind Thermopylae.
In 1885, the ship’s owner, Jock Willis
(white hat Willis), hired an excellent and eccentric captain named Richard
Woodget to sail the ship in the Australian wool trade.
In this arena the Cutty Sark once again
excelled, setting speed records between London and  Australia. For a decade she established herself
 through record breaking voyages, but in
1895 Willis sold her to the Portuguese. Renamed Ferreira, she served under the
Portuguese Flag until 1923 when she was purchased by Wilfred Dowman, for use as a
sail training ship.
The old ship has now been
restored and looks beautiful, but will never go to sea again. She rests in her
own dry dock in Greenwich, London.
It’s now time to build a
replica to sail the seven seas once more, as an ambassador to The Great Age of
Sail and as a working memorial to the men who sailed in these fantastic ships.





CUTTY SARK 2SAIL FOUNDATION is a charity and it has been entered onto the UK Register of Charities with the Registered Charity Number 1163446.



To recreate the clipper ship 'Cutty Sark' as a seagoing vessel which will be sailed in a traditional way, as a living memorial to the Great Age of Sailing Ships;

A brass plaques with the winners' names will be installed on the deck of the Cutty Sark 2.  And, if you wish, we will publish an interview with you on all Cutty Sark 2Sail resources.









At this first stage, we need to find the best way to build the sailing clipper – preserving all the historic details, and satisfying modern safety and ecological requirements. It is not an easy task – most sailing ships experience difficulties nowadays, dealing with more and more complicated regulations, invented for large steel motor vessels.  We will employ the most experienced naval architects to produce top quality, detailed calculations and to prove that classical sailing ships have rights to exist today – without compromising safety.


It is also important to note that this work is necessary and will be extremely useful for all working sailing ships, developing the level of understanding between sail training ships and international maritime authorities.















If the new ship is a replica, why do we need to produce a new design?

The world has changed. Safety standards are different. What was normal sailing practice 150 years ago is not acceptable today.
To achieve the latest safety standards, it will be necessary to rearrange some internal details in the ship. For example: some machinery space is required for generators to provide power – for safety equipment that we are obliged to include, and things like a fridge and a freezer; domestic fresh, grey and black water purification systems will also be required; lifesaving equipment, including life rafts and specially designed small tug-boats which regulations demand be carried on board … and don’t forget the requisite launching equipment or the advanced anchor system - with extra anchors at the stern – which must all be designed and placed in a “concealed” fashion so they don't detract from the aesthetic integrity of a 19th century vessel.
The main hull, masts, spars, rigging and all operating aspects will be unchanged from those of the original ship. The new Cutty Sark will have modern equipment on board, everything to provide her with the highest levels of safety. And she has to be built as a pure sailing ship which is environmentally friendly and sound. 
These modern additions will be carefully placed so that they will not disrupt the historical integrity of the original clipper.
Where does the money go if this crowdfunding campaign is not
successful?
The
Cutty Sark2Sail Foundation retains the collected funds.Even if we do not
succeed in collecting sufficient money for the completion of the first project stage through this crowdfunding campaign, the donated money will still be used to start the
project.
The Cutty Sark2Sail Foundation retains this funding and will continue
raising funds from other sources until enough money has been raised to complete the first stage (design) and go on the following stages (construction, launching and putting out to sea). 
Where does the estimated figure come from?Is
it a draft figure or an exact calculation?
The cost for the design work is 105,000 Euros (110,500$). That is the definite figure received as a firm quotation from
a company of professional naval
architects.  
What is total cost of building such ship and how is it made
up?

The total cost of the project of 19-26M Euros is an estimate, based on analysis of similar projects in Europe and other countries throughout the world. A full detailed budget will be available after the
detailed design of the ship is complete.
The estimate consists of the following:

120K €: Ship design and approvals
4M €: Site preparation and building viewing/accommodation facilities
880K €: Timber: Teak (130m3) + Rock Elm  (200m3) etc.
13M €: Labour
4M €: Equipment and tooling
4M €: Overheads and contingency
Total: 26M €


How will you raise this money? 

After completion of the design we
will be able to detail schedules and budgets. We will go to large companies
(like tea importing companies, wool producers, etc.) with proposals for
cooperation in the field of marketing their products using ecologically clean
transportation.

We will also approach large TV companies, with proposals to create video productions of constructing and sailing Cutty Sark 2.  Additionally, we will be
approaching potential sponsors and donors, with a request to help in supporting the preservation of maritime
heritage and traditional skills.
What will happen if we don't collect the required amount? 
 We will simply try and try again, until we succeed. 
To what extent will the ship be modified,
modernized?Will it still be historically accurate after the modification?
The plan will preserve ALL
visible parts of the ship in their true historical appearance. The way the ship is to be used will adhere to
traditional methods as much as possible. However, in the hold we will
hide a modern power
unit to produce electricity for state of the art navigation systems, and communication. All water & sewage purification systems, as well as up
to date safety systems will also be included on board. We will make these modifications in such a way that people’s impression of Cutty Sark 2
as the original vessel will not be compromised. We have successful achieved this previously when
designing the frigate Shtandart.
Are there professionals
in the Cutty Sark 2Sail Team who have relevant knowledge/experience?
We have people with considerable experience in building and
sailing traditional sailing ships. We also have team
members with marketing and project management expertise. We will enlist other professionals for the areas where
the team experience is lacking. Just to give you a glimpse:
Captain Vladimir Martus is a qualified
Naval Architect with deep sea sailing experience as a captain, and has Yacht Master
Instructor qualifications. He has built three large wooden replica
ships on his own and he has considerable
experience of the  most European
traditional sailing ships projects (Batavia, De Delft, Tenacious, Lord Nelson, HMS Trincomalee,
Gotheborg and Hermione).
Have you
carried out research; will Cutty Sark 2 be popular for sailing?
There is a definite demand for
ecological awareness and returning to our historical roots.
Cutty Sark 2 is going to create an information flow to keep people aware of good alternatives regarding the reducion of pollution and CO2 emissions. She will regenerate the skills and knowledge of past generation of
sailors. 
The detailed research on how much interest she will
attract is still on-going, but when we see the figures
of people attending maritime festivals, when we see queues of people waiting to visit traditional ships,
we think it is a definite sign that Cutty Sark 2 will have no difficulty in
attracting an audience and supporters.

Where will the new Cutty Sark be built?

We have
considered several possible places, and are now preparing a detailed survey to finalise on the best location.
Priorities for defining the best place to settle our museum shipyard are: 
1. We expect
the local
community to “adopt” the Cutty Sark 2Sail project as their own, with
friendly support on all levels: local authorities, construction and planning, tourism departments etc;  
2. Ideal place should have a potential for bringing in a lot
of visitors; 
3. Preferably, it should be a nice and interesting place for volunteers to come and
spend 4-8 weeks helping to the project.  
4. Above all, it must be
technical possibilities to build the ship, launch her and take her to out to
sea.  

The decision had not been made yet. We are in process of collecting
further information from many possible locations.



Where is Shtandart now? Is she sailing?


Yes, the exact replica of the 18th century wooden
frigate is still in active use. She has been sailing almost all year round, for
the last 16 years. Our team is actually using the experience and lessons
received from their experience with Shtandart to put into Cutty Sark 2 project.

</div></div>","The Honey Bee Portal (San Antonio, Texas)Fact: The number of bees is decreasing all over the world.The use of pesticides, habitat destruction, nutrition deficit, drought, air pollution and global warming, among some other factors, are killing our bees. Why is this important?  Because without bees, life as we know it would no longer be possible. That simple.According to Greenpeace, bees perform about 80 percent of all pollination worldwide. Without them, fruit, trees, plants, flowers or vegetables -90% of the key sources of food for humans- might not be available for an indeterminate amount of time. And although some few pollinators out there might feel compelled to take over for the disappearing bees' jobs, there are no guarantees that they would successfully perform all the duties of these amazing insects. Imagine for a moment, what would happen if bees would disappear completely?       Pretty scary, uh?We can stop this. We HAVE to stop this. Not only for us but for all the future generations.INTRODUCING: THE HONEY BEE PORTALWe are a group of bee-conscious people whose main mission is to educate the public about the plight of the honeybee and energize efforts to help bees make a comeback. Since June of 2012, we have been working on a tracking system that would allow us to put this project into motion.  As you may know, the decline in numbers of the bees is a very serious issue for humanity and it's time we take action to protect them. Part of this effort involves the development ofA very user-friendly app and a honeybee health database.

The core objective of The Honey Bee Portal  is to develop a honeybee health database which will contain data collected by Beekeepers, students, organizations, and scientists, as well as data from other honeybee health monitoring projects. Once the database has been developed, web-based tools and phone apps will be created to provide beekeepers convenient access to the system so that they can generate personalized management reports. These reports will utilize survey data to compare the success and failure of different management plans to suggest which plan is best suited to the needs of an individual beekeeper. In this way, the project uses beekeepers’ real world experience to solve beekeepers’ real world problems.  
The portal will help link the public to bee hives by allowing users to adopt a hive or to manage an existing one. Through this portal, you will be able to view your hive, collect information about it, and share useful information with other owners, scientists, and universities engaged in bee studies. 
This vital network will not only help raise awareness about bees and provide a platform for action to help bees make a comeback, it intends to become a wholesome community with no borders and accurate real-time information to make timely decisions to help bees grow strong as they  perform their own mission in this world. 


With this portal, you will: 
1. Track and access a wealth of information that no other app is able to provide.
2. Become part of a worldwide community that has your same interests and a common goal.
3. Participate actively in a worth-full mission to save not only the bees but also the world.
4. Become an urban beekeeper yourself!
        You can keep tabs on your hive's activity with the touch of one button. Here it is how it works:When you first register with the Honey Bee Portal, you will fill out a form that will allow us to collect data that we will use to create and provide accurate stats. Some of the information we will need includes, but not limited to:  Name
Address
Postcode
County
Country
Role (Beekeeper, Student, Scientist, Supporter, etc.)
List of diseases, pest and parasites, if any.
Treatments used
Time and dates with issues on hive or hives. 




All the collected information will be displayed in an easy-to-read format.

Taking notes while making an inspection of your hives will be like taking snapshots which can help track the progress of your hives.

Not only will you be able to record data, but take photos and store them in the cloud for later reference. By using the Honey Bee Portal you will be able to log information to help foresee any potential problems before they occur, and troubleshoot when they do. Just imagine how by connecting your information with thousands of other beekeepers will aid you to develop a better defense against pest and diseases!



Think of this. With this portal, you could know in real-time when a nearby hive has just become infected with the Varroa mite (or worse!)  
Knowing in advance can help you take the necessary steps to prevent the spread of pathogens and parasites. You would be connected to people who are studying fungus that kills the varroa mite without any chemicals, or the best place to set a bee hive in a wet area. 



The options are endless when it comes to all the ways this portal can help you protect your bees and learn more about them! 
With the Honey Bee Portal, you will have access to all types of data in real-time, no matter where you are! From migrations to the increasing or decreasing of honeybees' presence. No beekeeper is alike and that’s what makes this tool so valuable. Just select an area that you would like to monitor and see how yours or your friends' bee hives are doing. The more powerful thing of this community portal is that the more you use it, the more relevant and efficient it will become!
It's like being part of a hive that is connected throughout the world where all members strive to do things better, easier, safer and smarter. 



With this technology, together, we will change how we manage the honeybees to ensure its survival as well as our own. 





Track your hives or any other hive. If you choose to monitor your own hives, The Honey Bee Portal will feed you with any collected data that The Honey Bee Portal members have added.
Create your own group of beekeeper friends. When choosing to create your own group you can pick as many as you like. Everyone will be able to share information.
Connect with paleontologist or mix it up. It's your Honey Bee Hotel Portal!




Let's talk about Network Security!
As you know, having a network portal makes everyone a little ""shaky"". The major concern is to know if ""my information is safe.""

<p><u>Mission and vision:</u></p>
<p>The story of the region and
its people is same throughout. Endangered traditional livelihood [caused by
heavy erosion triggering loss of farm-land; forest-resources like wood, honey
etc. being unavailable either for the strict enforcement of the present laws,
or being scanty due to over-exploitation; crab, fish and other aquatic
resources being scanty than earlier] is not peculiar to one or two blocks of
the zone, but to the whole of the region. <b>The mission of this organization
is to restore the opportunity of livelihood to the local inhabitants. </b>To
fulfil this aim, it has defined the following objectives:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>To
restore the nature of the region, deteriorated by over-exploitation through
decades-</p>
<p>o<span>  </span>Through mangrove afforestation: As per
government records, here in the Sundarban area, about 60 species of mangrove
thrive. Our endeavour is to increase their number in balanced proportion
throughout the region as observed in nature so that the afforestation drive
remains sustainable, and men may bear the fruit of the forest resources from
their very villages.</p>
<p>o<span>  </span>By protecting the natural embankments
of the estuaries, thus, actually protecting the farmlands, one of the most
important provisions of livelihood in the region that lie next to the banks:
This is to be done in a manner that is sustainable and eco-friendly. Hence, no
artificial embankments are to be erected, rather careful plantation of mangrove
is to be adopted to hold the banks strong against the water and wind, and to
make their slope gradients gently gradual.</p>
<p>o<span>  </span>By restoring the aquatic environment
at the estuaries: Polluting factors like oil-spill from boats and trawlers or
industrial waste being carried by the river Hooghly are right now beyond our
scope of control. But apart from that, again, calculated mangrove plantation on
the banks of the rivers and estuaries of the region can restore the population
of the crabs and fish back by providing them their food to grow and shelter to
thrive. At the same time, control of plastic waste into the water from the
locality is to be achieved to accelerate the rate of restoration.</p>
<p>o<span>  </span>By exploring newer ways of
eco-friendly sustainability in terms of livelihood: Developing local
handicrafts utilizing natural objects like fiber etc. locally procured,
commercial utilization of the inland water bodies which otherwise are used only
for domestic purpose, initiating responsible tourism, promoting apiary,
enhancing the scope of the cultivable land by promoting and reviving the
cultivation of the long-abandoned indigenous saline water resistant variety of
paddy etc. is to be planned methodically so that the scope of livelihood
generation increases at the same place without affecting the nature.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>To
restore the nature of the population, turned dull by lack of proper education-</p>
<p>o<span>  </span>By awareness campaigns: Regular
campaigns are to be organized throughout the region, ensuring the participation
of the maximum of the younger generation, so that they grow up with a concern
for the ecology of the largest mangrove region of the world, and they live with
a cause to protect this richness of nature they are gifted with for providing
them with the opportunity of livelihood.</p>
<p>o<span>  </span>By participatory programmes: Regular
programmes should be planned and executed to ensure the participation of the
local population as volunteers in the various projects undertaken, mostly the
younger generation, for only awareness does not generate compassion, rather
involvement does the trick. Nature cannot be restored and pro-nature livelihood
cannot be generated as well as maintained without a sympathetic and
compassionate population thriving in it. </p>
<p>The vision is the great
fusion which we dream- here, the population will live and grow with its rich
natural environment, not exploiting it, rather exploring it to find newer means
to develop the region,  thereby grow
themselves. Men here will live as a part of nature, without asking the question
of being superior or taming the wild forces without understanding them. The
region will exist as a true ‘biosphere’, as is meant actually by the term. <b>We
also love to dream that one day the people here will lead the world by their
example of living and leading a life that co-exists with and along nature, by
hinting at ways to combat each and every human endeavour to manipulate the
nature to its ultimate destruction.</b></p>
<p><b>Action area:</b></p>
<p>Current: </p>
<p>Kumirmari Gram Panchayet,
Gosaba Block, Canning Sub-division, South 24 Parganas, West Bengal, India.</p>
<p><b>Location:</b> The villages of Kumirmari
Gram Panchayat are surrounded by River Raymangal and River Sarsa, Korankhali. </p>
<p>Population: The island is
the home place for about [ ] people, out of which, more than 80% is SC/ST
community. Most of them are typical poverty-stricken rural folk living in mud
huts with thatched roofs. </p>
<p><b>Occupation and economy</b>: Farming and fishing along
with crab-hunting are the bread earning provision for most of the population
residing in the place. Most of the farmers are marginal farmers, depending upon
less than three bighas [I acre] of land for his family yielding once annually.
If the labour cost is excluded, a year with a generous yield of paddy will let
them earn a maximum of twelve-fifteen thousand INR annually per acre. For the
small fishermen and crab hunter of the island, the situation is poorer. With
the advancement of technology, the able fishermen hunt the mouth of the rivers
and adjoining bay such that a very little fish can make their way to the
estuaries hunted by these small fishermen. Moreover, most of them are without
any land to cultivate. Hence, the population here is mostly below poverty
level, striving hard to meet their both ends, and finally, opting for
migration, either seasonal or permanent.</p>
<p><b>Infrastructure: </b>The GP [Gram Panchayat] is
without any electricity till date, the roads are mostly kaccha, and three are
brick-layed. Solar electricity are used as alternative source of energy, though
the supercyclone ‘Aila’ has reached an immense injury to the solar panels
installed.</p>
<p><b>Education:</b> Two high schools, six
primary schools and some ICDS centre cater to the educational need of the people.
</p>
<p>Health: The people are to
depend on three health sub-centres [these are centres attented by trained
nurses and ASHA workers and are without any doctors] in case of any medical
emergencies. The whole island is without any medical shop, or any trained doctor’s
chamber. However, some quacks are here to carry the burden.</p>
<p>Culture: Traditionally, the
people here celebrate the Bonobibi Utsab in the month of January. However,
recently people are getting more enthusiastic about celebrating the Durga-Puja
or Kali-Puja. In fact, Bonobibi Utsab has been able to retain its importance
only among those who still frequent the nearby forest area to hunt its
resources.</p>
<p><b>Proposed:</b></p>
<p>Chhoto Mollakhali Gram
Panchayat and Kachukhali Gram Panchayat: two adjoining GP of Kumirmari.</p>

<p><b>Activities:  </b></p>
<p><b>Afforestation:</b> volunteers approached,
survey done, seeds procured, fund raised, volunteers participated, the
activity, time period.</p>
<p>The local people were
approached informally at different local hangouts, particularly the youth were
targeted. The crisis of sustenance was discussed, and the ways of probable
solutions were also shared. With those who shared a common view, the older generation
of the island was also approached. Their guidance proved to be very useful in
selecting the spots where we intended to start the plantation programme first.
Local schools and clubs were also approached. The subject was shared with the
local school children too in order to make them aware of the facts. The local
clubs as well as the schools provided a needed thrust to the ongoing discussion
of the crisis by incorporating the subject in both academic competitions like
quiz, debate, essay-writing etc. and cultural activities like staging a drama
or composing a poem or song. </p>
<p>The forest department of
the region and sub-division was approached first for seeds and saplings needed
for the purpose. However, as their nursery was not equipped for the purpose, it
was decided to collect the seeds on our own. The elders again came forward
pointing out spots where the seeds from the forest are washed ashore. As per
their guidance, they were collected during the low tides with group of
volunteers from the villages. Moreover, the local fishermen were approached to
handover the seeds that are caught at their nets, which they mostly used as
fuel to burn for cooking purpose. This approach also fulfilled the objective of
promoting awareness, for many turned to share our purpose when told the reason
of collecting the seeds.</p>
<p>The plantation programme
started in the month of April and continued to September in the year 2013
amidst a mixed reaction from the public in general. Some actively volunteered;
some watched passively; some threw some valuable suggestion about the planting
job while passing by; and some commented to demoralize. However, mostly people
said and worked positively, and the local residents tirelessly kept their
cattle’s grazing under control and protected the young saplings after they
germinated.</p>
<p>The process is still in
continuation, and the rate has increased as more and more volunteers are
pouring in every year, and are being inspired to turn the spots at or near
their land similarly green. Many, both individually as well as institutionally
[particularly the local clubs] approach us to carry on the programme at or near
their premises when they are on or near the embankments.</p>
<p>Protection of embankment
and thereby cultivable land along with dwelling houses in the villages: A
stretch of 4.5 km embankment of river Sarsa has been covered with twenty
thousand surviving mangrove out of more than twenty seven thousand planted,
thereby protecting the stretch from both water and wind. It is being
anticipated that securing this stretch of embankment, at least a population of
600 families are being protected with their cultivable land and domicile.</p>
<p><b>Restoration of the aquatic
environment in the area:</b>
Afforestation in the said stretch has helped a lot to restore the aquatic environment,
by providing needed habitat to the aquatic flora and fauna. As a result, the
red crabs, which used to frequent the places long long ago, have returned
again, as the local residents are reporting themselves; and the seedlings of
tiger prawn [collection of which is a popular way of earning in the region] are
being reported to pour in this zone in more numbers than the adjoining places.
Kartick Barman, a local resident reported us of having caught a lot of vetki
and crabs particularly in the monsoon of 2015 from this very region. He cannot
remember when he had such a fishing back last and that too, at his doorsteps.
This year, he had not visited elsewhere for fishing, but is hunting through the
jungle that is growing at his doorsteps. Other people have also reported about
the increasing number of fishes like kan, pangash, dapur etc. in the zone.</p>
<p><b>Reviving the long abandoned
indigenous varieties of paddy:</b> 12 farming families have ventured to cultivate 16 long
abandoned indigenous varieties of paddy in a stretch of 30 bighas [10 acres] of
land. They have returned to this long forgotten salinity resistant varieties of
paddy partially at their fields again being burdened by the heavy cost of
cultivating the high yielding varieties. Moreover, apart from the low cost
involvement in this case, they are expecting a longer straw this time as
bi-product which will in turn come very handy while thatching the roofs not
only for its length, but also for its longivity.</p>
<p><b>Collaboration: </b> In collaboration with Rotaract Club of
Heritage Engineering College, fifty poor families in this island without any
proper provision of light for the dark hours are provided with solar lamps to
enhance the feelings of humanity. It has also been decided that a health camp
will be organized soon to promote awareness and to survey the public health
condition in general empirically so that something can be planned accordingly
for the villagers’ benefit.</p>
<p><b>Future plan:</b> a) Discussions have
started to make the most of the inland water bodies. About 15 families have
stepped forward in order to learn the scientific techniques and ways to explore
their ponds and pools to reap a better harvest. Our organization is in the
process of negotiating experts for the purpose.</p>
<p>b) Starts practices of
organic farming among 50 farmer</p>
<p>c) Initiatives are already
undertaken to promote responsible eco-tourism in the area, with the objective
of knowledge exchange mostly. Primary survey is complete for the purpose, and a
number of eager host families are waiting to start their drive. Already they
have gathered a first-hand experience in the job while they accommodated 9
students of sociology in two batches from Bosco Institute, Assam and Pune
Institute, Maharashtra, visiting the area for academic knowledge exchange
programme in the year 2014-15 for twenty and seven days respectively.
Department of Environmental Science, University of Calcutta also frequents the
area for similar academic purpose, and thus provides a boost to the initiative.</p>
<p>d) 200000 mangrove
plantation throughout the river embankment of Kumirmari gram panchayat area.
This will protect our land from the river erosion.   </p>
<p><b>Why me?</b></p>
<p>After completing a 2 year Create to Inspire Fellowship last year, creating artistic products with more than 200 young people of Kolkata that would make the environment a trending subject, I have decided that one of my missions being an artist and arts manager would be to continuously support those who have dedicated their lives to the environment and its safekeeping ! </p><p>Pranabesh is no outsider to Sunderbans, but
a son of the soil. he has been a victim of the issues himself discussed above
like any other youth of the time in his locality. Hence,he has realized the
concerns himself with his own life and experiences, instead of learning about
them from others’ experiences.</p>
<p>He himself, along with his other mates have tried to combat the situation as per their own understanding of
the issues, and I must say that they are already being rewarded in the process by
nature itself. It proves that their experiences were explored properly, and their initiatives to combat the situation were not mistaken. </p>
<p>But they need support, and a lot of it. You my friend can join hands by initially contributing Rs 2 to buy a mangrove sapling for his afforestation drive. Then visit him in Sunderban and come forward with expertise, skills, people, funds and whatever other support you can offer. Support The Mangrove Man to do what he is doing !

<br/></div>","Organization:
Sundarban Green Environment Association  
Place:
Kumirmari (Gosaba)
Mission and vision:
The story of the region and
its people is same throughout. Endangered traditional livelihood [caused by
heavy erosion triggering loss of farm-land; forest-resources like wood, honey
etc. being unavailable either for the strict enforcement of the present laws,
or being scanty due to over-exploitation; crab, fish and other aquatic
resources being scanty than earlier] is not peculiar to one or two blocks of
the zone, but to the whole of the region. The mission of this organization
is to restore the opportunity of livelihood to the local inhabitants. To
fulfil this aim, it has defined the following objectives:
· 
To
restore the nature of the region, deteriorated by over-exploitation through
decades-
o  Through mangrove afforestation: As per
government records, here in the Sundarban area, about 60 species of mangrove
thrive. Our endeavour is to increase their number in balanced proportion
throughout the region as observed in nature so that the afforestation drive
remains sustainable, and men may bear the fruit of the forest resources from
their very villages.
o  By protecting the natural embankments
of the estuaries, thus, actually protecting the farmlands, one of the most
important provisions of livelihood in the region that lie next to the banks:
This is to be done in a manner that is sustainable and eco-friendly. Hence, no
artificial embankments are to be erected, rather careful plantation of mangrove
is to be adopted to hold the banks strong against the water and wind, and to
make their slope gradients gently gradual.
o  By restoring the aquatic environment
at the estuaries: Polluting factors like oil-spill from boats and trawlers or
industrial waste being carried by the river Hooghly are right now beyond our
scope of control. But apart from that, again, calculated mangrove plantation on
the banks of the rivers and estuaries of the region can restore the population
of the crabs and fish back by providing them their food to grow and shelter to
thrive. At the same time, control of plastic waste into the water from the
locality is to be achieved to accelerate the rate of restoration.
o  By exploring newer ways of
eco-friendly sustainability in terms of livelihood: Developing local
handicrafts utilizing natural objects like fiber etc. locally procured,
commercial utilization of the inland water bodies which otherwise are used only
for domestic purpose, initiating responsible tourism, promoting apiary,
enhancing the scope of the cultivable land by promoting and reviving the
cultivation of the long-abandoned indigenous saline water resistant variety of
paddy etc. is to be planned methodically so that the scope of livelihood
generation increases at the same place without affecting the nature.
· 
To
restore the nature of the population, turned dull by lack of proper education-
o  By awareness campaigns: Regular
campaigns are to be organized throughout the region, ensuring the participation
of the maximum of the younger generation, so that they grow up with a concern
for the ecology of the largest mangrove region of the world, and they live with
a cause to protect this richness of nature they are gifted with for providing
them with the opportunity of livelihood.
o  By participatory programmes: Regular
programmes should be planned and executed to ensure the participation of the
local population as volunteers in the various projects undertaken, mostly the
younger generation, for only awareness does not generate compassion, rather
involvement does the trick. Nature cannot be restored and pro-nature livelihood
cannot be generated as well as maintained without a sympathetic and
compassionate population thriving in it. 
The vision is the great
fusion which we dream- here, the population will live and grow with its rich
natural environment, not exploiting it, rather exploring it to find newer means
to develop the region,  thereby grow

region will exist as a true ‘biosphere’, as is meant actually by the term. We
also love to dream that one day the people here will lead the world by their
example of living and leading a life that co-exists with and along nature, by
hinting at ways to combat each and every human endeavour to manipulate the
nature to its ultimate destruction.

</p><p></p>
<p></p><p><b>Why this farm.</b></p><p>I (Charlotte Anthony) started Terra Lingua Farms after  2 years in India, where 70% of the farming is done without irrigation often with less than  20 inches of rain a year.  I learned in India quick ways to turn poor soils into carbon-rich fertile soil without adding any kind of fertilizer.   In India there are places where, each year, for hundreds of years,  the ground has becomes more fertile, in spite of harvesting a lot of produce.  </p><p>In India with the sheer numbers of people and most of the farmers describing  to me how they lacked the water they needed and how their neighbors had already given up farming, i lived among the symptoms underlying starvation, climate change, drought, desertification.  Soon after my return, I had an ah hah moment, recognizing that these are all related to what i now understand to be the industrial farming system.</p><p>Being a life time farmer, I decided to find a place in the desert, with little water and show how this farming system could solve all these problems.  Rather than looking for prime soil,  as most farmers  do, I looked for soil which needed regenerating and where there was little rain fall.   I found a place in Eastern Oregon with a couple that have 500 acres.  I leased 20 acres of land and drastically shifted my life to move here.  I  gathered  my personal resources,  and with the help of several people who have been impressed over the years with my work started this farm.  It is not easy.  It is isolated here with the closest supermarket or place to buy tools  1.5 hours away.   My friends are 5 hours away in Eugene. Most every day, especially when it is hot,  I reaffirm to myself how blessed I am to be able to demonstrate a way to alleviate some of the major ills on this planet at this time.</p><p><b>Experience:</b></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""> I worked in  orchards,  mentoring with one of New England's foremost orchardists, Bill Darrow.    I have  a 20 year history working with  permaculture and natural farming systems.  I started a  Community Supported Agriculture project in Paonia, Co.  I coordinated the permaculture demonstration gardens in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.   With my team, I started  more than 650 gardens for people in Eugene, Oregon with a pay it forward system. I helped create 7 food forests in Oregon and California. Through all of this I have been using microbial inoculations effectively in all types of soils.</span><br/></p><p>I helped many farmers in India set up swales, ponds, etc. to hold water in their soils and revitalize their wells.   Once  I understood traditional Indian farming, I helped land owners who had lost this knowledge establish these systems on their farms.</p><p><b>What is different
about our system?</b></p>
<p>The difference between
what we are doing and industrial agriculture is huge.   Industrial
agriculture treats the soil as a blank slate to which they add what science and
commercial fertilizer companies indicate the plants need to grow. They take out all the trees and habitat for insects (90% of which are beneficial). The chemicals used cause the plants to take up as
much as 5 times the water. Since the plants have only a part of what they
really need, they attract insects and viruses.  Weeds are nature's way to begin to balance the
soil.</p>
<p>In our system, we rely on the living organisms  in the soil which partner with the plants giving them
the fertilizer, the air and the water that they need even in low rainfall
situations.   We do not desroy these organisms by tilling.</p>
<p><b>What do we actually do</b>?  </p>
<p>We are creating an
edible food forest.  This means we are
mimicking forest conditions and growing food with trees as the primary focus.  A forest is a living system where  the soil
gets more fertile every year. </p>
<p>We have a whole-systems
approach, many things working together including: inoculating the soil
with microbes, holding rainwater in the soil, dry land farming  (no
irrigation), hedge rows, mulch beds, and planting many types of crops that
nourish each other in a no till system.  This system creates fertile soil
easily and quickly.  The microbes in the soil sequester carbon and this
carbon feeds the crops.  There is little
money spent on external inputs, no pesticides, no herbicides etc., leaving the
farmer with a living wage.  Maybe more importantly, if enough acres
around the world were to use this system, desertification would be reversed and
climate change would be seriously mitigated.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>If this system works so well, why aren’t all farmers doing it.</b></p>
<p>Farmers do not know
about this system.  We are doing this
demonstration farm to show farmers how they can 
make good money (at least $5,000 an acre net) by the third year) at the same time that they regenerate
their soil, allowing the land to supply food far into the future.   </p>
<p>Current industrial farming
practices are decimating the soil, as well as initiating 35% of the carbon in the
atmosphere.  Side effects to  humans and animals from chemicals including
fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides are causing increasing medical and veterinary
bills as well as reducing quality of life. </p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Right now this whole
system approach to agriculture is not understood by most farmers.  Terra Lingua is a demonstration farm showing actual costs,
yields and soil samples so farmers can understand how this works.  We are also a hands-on teaching facility for the finer points of the system.</span><b><br/></b></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p><div><b>Are there any existing farms using biologically based systems making incomes that would satisfy farmers.  </b></div><p></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">There are now farmers
in the United States and around the world applying these principles effectively using animals.  It is a mob grazing
system and is practiced by  farmers such as  Gabe Brown, Joel Salatin, Alan Savory and many
others.  Our approach works with microfauna (microscopic animals and
plants) rather than macrofauna (animals).  Not all farmers want to work
with animals. Also we need to eat food other than just meat.  One farmer who did not use animals for meat
or dairy in India was Narsanna Koppula.  We are demonstrating a
system where fruit and nut trees, forest trees, herbs, vegetables, grains,
legumes, and oil seeds nurture the earth and provide food and lumbar.</span><br/></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Carbon farming:  </b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">How do you reverse desertification
(stop drought) and mitigate climate change with farming? </span></p><p>Plants working with their microbial
partners take C02 from the air and store carbon in the soil.  This is how the plants get their food
(fertilizer).  One of the microbes, the
mycorhizzals increase the length of the plant roots by as much as 10
times.  They also bring water and minerals
from the surrounding plants.  This is how
all plants were watered and fertilized before chemicals, including trees
hundreds of feet tall.   </p>
<p>Unfarmed or not
overgrazed soils, whether forest or prairie, have huge amounts of carbon stored
in them. Once the soils are farmed with current tilling, fertilizing and
irrigating methods, or degraded into desert through overgrazing, or removing
all the trees, the carbon stores in the soil are released into the air as CO2.
 A resource, the carbon in the soil, which has been a solution for
millions of years, becomes a big part of the problem. With our system, the
carbon in the soil is exponentially increased.  This means that the
water-holding capacity as well as fertility of the soil is also exponentially increased. </p>
<p>We have selected Terra
Lingua Farm as our proving ground, with 8-15 inches of rain a year and degraded
soils.  The place where the rubber meets the road for our system is
to get the microbial content high enough to retain the water so that seeds can
start and grow.  Many desert farmers are using irrigation. 
We are not.  This means spraying
with the microbes many times. The microbes need water and organic matter to
multiply and we need to keep priming the pump so to speak, until the microbes
take off.  Most importantly,  without the quickly
increased carbon holding capacity the desert areas may not be able to be
farmed.  With good microbial content the organic matter in the soil can go from
1% (often the case with industrial agriculture to 11%).  </p>
<p>The key to fertility
in the soil is the microbes that are in that soil.  With the help of the
microbes, any soil has all the available minerals needed to feed the plants.  The soil tests usually done measure what
the soil has available without microbes.   Please see soil scientist,
Elaine Ingham’s, ‘The Roots of Your Profits’ on YouTube if you’re curious about
exactly how this works.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>What We Need</b></p>
<p>We are leasing 20
acres of a 500-acre farm in Kimberly, Oregon.  We came here because we
wanted to show how these methods would work in desert conditions.  Imagine how much more food could be grown
around the world if we could grow food in the deserts.  We came to this particular land, as the land
owners would like their land to be productive, and they would love to see their
local community become prosperous.  The farming in these parts
is mainly cattle for beef but, sadly, the farmers and/or spouses must take
an extra paid job as their farms do not support them.</p>
<p>The land owner is
allowing us to use some of his farm equipment and, when time permits, he is
helping us with various projects such as chisel plowing of the fields (a first
year practice which is used to hold water in the soil and does not involve
turning the soil),  He is also digging
water trenches for our camping area, and making outdoor kitchen and bathing
facilities.  He does this in return for a share of the produce and
profit. </p>
<p>There are still a lot
of purchases that we need to make.  We need
seeds for herbs, vegetables, trees and
berries. We also need to purchase berry bushes and trees.   We need several trailers for living
quarters for our students and a paid assistant manager.  We need to pay
labor costs including an assistant manager who can operate and maintain the
tractors we are being allowed to use.  The camp is totally off-grid so we
need solar panels for electricity.  We also need fencing.</p>
<p>The other major
expense is for samples of both soil and the food we are growing.  We want
to document our rapid increase of carbon in the soil along with rapid increase
of soil biology.   We also want to document the nutrition in the food that
we grow.</p><p>
In total, we want to raise $13,000 to continue the farm.  We anticipate needing additional funds and as
this is a profit endeavor, we will look for loans.  It is easier to get loans once we can show the farm.  Also after the first
year we will have income from our crops.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Other Ways You Can
Help Mitigate Climate Change and Reverse Desertification and Starvation:</b></p>
<p>Besides money contributions, we also need help
getting the word out.  If you are on any social media, please share there
and with any friends on and off social media and in any groups you are involved
in that are appropriate for this. </p>
<p>This campaign is meant
to be help people understand what what  carbon farming is, what putting carbon in the soil can do for climate
change.   Even if people cannot contribute financially it is a good education tool.   Please look at the Indiegogo share tools!</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>To Wrap  Up:</b></p>
<p>Many people doing
this type of system (permaculture, edible food forestry, agoforestry,
agroecology) are not using microbial inoculations.  Without these
innoculations it will take  more time to build up the carbon
holding capacity of the soil which we at Terra Lingua will do in 1 year. 
This translates to soil fertility, water holding capacity and therefore
production.  It also means that we can farm without irrigation in the desert, making as much as 50% more land available world wide for agriculture.</p>

<div><br/></div> <p>Since one year we run a wildlife conservancy bordering the great Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya. This area is one of the most genuine and unspoiled pieces of nature on earth. It is one of the most game-rich areas in Africa. There are several threats to the area in the form of increased population and cultivation but also poaching.  The way to save this land and all the wildlife for the future is to form Conservancies where the wildlife and the Maasai population can co-exist in a balanced manner. By leasing the land from the Maasai they also get a direct benefit from conservation and tourism.</p>
<p>My name is Karl von Heland and I have a passion for this area. I am from Sweden but my Kenyan history goes back to my grandfather Eric who came to Kenya in 1919 working as Manager of the farm owned by the famous Karen and Bror von Blixen-Finecke (also known from the movie Out of Africa). </p>
<p>I built a small safari camp, Entumoto Safari Camp, in 2007 together with my ""adopted"" maasai son Rimoine Ole Kararei, just outside the actual park in the Sekenani Valley.  This is a place of stunning beauty with rolling hills and views over the Rift Valley. </p>
<p>The Mara region used to be total wilderness but has seen a sharp increase in population in the last 20 years as the Maasai have been forced away from their nomadic life, to settle down so the kids can go to school. As maasai love cattle the numbers has been increasing sharply, also with increased wealth, so the situation has <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">grewn un-sustainable in many areas.  Most of the land in the wider Mara region has been privatized in the last few years and each family has got a piece of private land. This means they will have to totally change their lifestyle.</span></p>
<p>The Entumoto conservancy was established in march 2014 and became an immediate success. As all cows were removed from the area wildlife poured back in and we now have all the big five and an abundance of game in the area. Cattle can still graze occasionally and in separate zones, under strict control.</p>
<p>We have however been working for long to expand the area from 2600 acres of land leased from 400 families to about 35.000 acres of land leased from all 3.500 landowners in the area (a small part of each landowners land). We have involved several other small camps to join this development and the starting date shall be in july 2015. This fantastic development is now in jeopardy.</p>
<p>Due to the crisis in tourism in Africa some of these  partners will not be able to fund the conservancy as planned and the whole project risk being delayed or even fail. Western tourists stopped traveling to Africa last year as Ebola stroke in Western Africa, some 5300 kilometers away! Also, islamic groups have been terrorizing  the Somali border and occasionally parts of the coast and Nairobi. Even though life is very much normal in most parts of Kenya tourism has been very hard hit. </p>
<p>We thus need additional funding to make this grand project succeed. We have been granted about 600.000 USD from a UK sponsor through WWF. This will help in the initial funding of the management company to  hire rangers, buy patrol cars but also on education and community projects.  </p>
<p>But we still need to cover up for those tourism partners who can not find the financing. All these funds will go into leasing the land. There are 3500 maasai families that shall get an initial fixed lease of 6.500 Ksh (70 USD) per year and then increasing. We also need to fund part of the salaries and running cost for the rangers who will secure the area from poaching. We have lots of elephants and also rhinos in the area and the poaching has increased as demand from China and Vietnam has pushed prices for ivory and rhino horn to the level of gold.</p>
<p>We have two different operations in this area, the bush camp Entumoto <a href=""http://www.entumoto.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.entumoto.com</a> and our trust, the Peder von Heland Trust, (see Facebook peder von heland trust entumoto). The trust runs different community projects such as the funding of a Rescue Center for Maasai girls in need of protection from circumsition and early marriage and a vocational training center. Please visit the Facebook or web-sites to see more pictures and information.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need to secure the funding of the leases and wages to rangers etc for at least one year until we can secure the local funding as tourism comes back and more camps and lodges can join the project. </p>
<p>We have been working on this project for many years together with the local maasai community. We have joined forces with two good tourism partners, Mara Bushtops and Leleshwa camp and several NGO's who are focusing on conservation. As the land in this area, Siana, was mapped and equally distributed to the maasai last year this project could come true. Meetings has been held in all villages surrounding the area and the local leaders has worked hard to convince the community to vote for the formation of the conservancy.</p>
<p>There is now two formal companies formed for the conservancy. One Landowners Company and one Management Company. The Landowners company is owned and managed by the local maasai and they will deal with all issues related to the land. The management company has a board of directors consisting of three maasai elected by the Landowners Company and three tourism partners from Entumoto, Mara Bushtops and Leleshwa. </p>
<p>The Management Company has set all rules for the conservancy such as grazing rights, trespassing rights, limitations on tourism, payments etc etc. We will also hire rangers and manage the conservancy.</p>
<p>By sponsring this project you will actively help us preserve a very important part of Africa to wildlife but also help the Maasai benefit from conservation. As all land is now privatized in the area there will be no land for the maasai to walk and graze their cattle. By introducing strict grazing rules and conditions in the conservancy (Zone grazing in different times of the year) we will make it possible for the landowners to maintain some of their old nomadic grazing culture and the community is actually quite enthusiastic about it. There are many examples of successful conservancies around in Kenya and best practices are being developed.</p>
<p>The funds we collect from you will go 100 % into financing the conservancy and linked community projects. We need all the help we can get, even if we do not reach our entire goal.</p>

</div></div>","Masai Mara Conservation - save the wildlife and the culture
 Since one year we run a wildlife conservancy bordering the great Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya. This area is one of the most genuine and unspoiled pieces of nature on earth. It is one of the most game-rich areas in Africa. There are several threats to the area in the form of increased population and cultivation but also poaching.  The way to save this land and all the wildlife for the future is to form Conservancies where the wildlife and the Maasai population can co-exist in a balanced manner. By leasing the land from the Maasai they also get a direct benefit from conservation and tourism.
My name is Karl von Heland and I have a passion for this area. I am from Sweden but my Kenyan history goes back to my grandfather Eric who came to Kenya in 1919 working as Manager of the farm owned by the famous Karen and Bror von Blixen-Finecke (also known from the movie Out of Africa). 
I built a small safari camp, Entumoto Safari Camp, in 2007 together with my ""adopted"" maasai son Rimoine Ole Kararei, just outside the actual park in the Sekenani Valley.  This is a place of stunning beauty with rolling hills and views over the Rift Valley. 
The Mara region used to be total wilderness but has seen a sharp increase in population in the last 20 years as the Maasai have been forced away from their nomadic life, to settle down so the kids can go to school. As maasai love cattle the numbers has been increasing sharply, also with increased wealth, so the situation has grewn un-sustainable in many areas.  Most of the land in the wider Mara region has been privatized in the last few years and each family has got a piece of private land. This means they will have to totally change their lifestyle.
The Entumoto conservancy was established in march 2014 and became an immediate success. As all cows were removed from the area wildlife poured back in and we now have all the big five and an abundance of game in the area. Cattle can still graze occasionally and in separate zones, under strict control.
We have however been working for long to expand the area from 2600 acres of land leased from 400 families to about 35.000 acres of land leased from all 3.500 landowners in the area (a small part of each landowners land). We have involved several other small camps to join this development and the starting date shall be in july 2015. This fantastic development is now in jeopardy.
Due to the crisis in tourism in Africa some of these  partners will not be able to fund the conservancy as planned and the whole project risk being delayed or even fail. Western tourists stopped traveling to Africa last year as Ebola stroke in Western Africa, some 5300 kilometers away! Also, islamic groups have been terrorizing  the Somali border and occasionally parts of the coast and Nairobi. Even though life is very much normal in most parts of Kenya tourism has been very hard hit. 
We thus need additional funding to make this grand project succeed. We have been granted about 600.000 USD from a UK sponsor through WWF. This will help in the initial funding of the management company to  hire rangers, buy patrol cars but also on education and community projects.  
But we still need to cover up for those tourism partners who can not find the financing. All these funds will go into leasing the land. There are 3500 maasai families that shall get an initial fixed lease of 6.500 Ksh (70 USD) per year and then increasing. We also need to fund part of the salaries and running cost for the rangers who will secure the area from poaching. We have lots of elephants and also rhinos in the area and the poaching has increased as demand from China and Vietnam has pushed prices for ivory and rhino horn to the level of gold.
We have two different operations in this area, the bush camp Entumoto www.entumoto.com and our trust, the Peder von Heland Trust, (see Facebook peder von heland trust entumoto). The trust runs different community projects such as the funding of a Rescue Center for Maasai girls in need of protection from circumsition and early marriage and a vocational training center. Please visit the Facebook or web-sites to see more pictures and information.   What We Need & What You Get We need to secure the funding of the leases and wages to rangers etc for at least one year until we can secure the local funding as tourism comes back and more camps and lodges can join the project.

There is now two formal companies formed for the conservancy. One Landowners Company and one Management Company. The Landowners company is owned and managed by the local maasai and they will deal with all issues related to the land. The management company has a board of directors consisting of three maasai elected by the Landowners Company and three tourism partners from Entumoto, Mara Bushtops and Leleshwa. 
The Management Company has set all rules for the conservancy such as grazing rights, trespassing rights, limitations on tourism, payments etc etc. We will also hire rangers and manage the conservancy.

There are many examples of successful conservancies around in Kenya and best practices are being developed.
The funds we collect from you will go 100 % into financing the conservancy and linked community projects. We need all the help we can get, even if we do not reach our entire goal.
The Impact
 We know how important it is to get this conservancy up and running as we can see how well it has worked in our initial site, the Entumoto Conservancy.
One year ago we managed to gather 300 maasai under a tree in the Sekenani Valley. Many of the local politicians and leaders also came to give long speeches and describe how important it would be for them all to secure more land for wildlife and tourism. 
My maasai partner Rimoine had a big bag with cash and we had also asked a local bank from Narok to send some staff to open bank accounts for these who wanted to join. We had also managed to get the list of all owners of specific plots and as they signed a lease agreement for their plot they got some cash and could open a bank account (the cooperative bank clercs had portable pc.s with mobile modems so it was down right there, under the tree).
When this was done in march 2014 the whole area was filled with cattle. Some from the neighborhood walking in grazing in the days and some from far which means there were temporary bomas all over the place (a boma is built by thorny bushes to keep lions and hyenas out and the cattle and the herders stay there during the night). 
As this area is right next to the park and the whole Serengeti eco-system (no fences) there were quite a lot of game but the number of cows often kept them away.
The day after the big meeting all herders were told to leave the area and after some weeks of debating and organizing they were all gone. Just days later  the first tower of giraff came in, followed by elephants, buffalo and even wild dogs.  Nature revived and during the great wildebeest migration in july the whole area was filled with zebra, wildebeest and all types of antelopes. 
Today, one year later, we have a resident pride of lions who just had cubs. We have had rhinos scouting the area and last week we had a first ostrich coming in. It is just amazing how quick this land has been taken back by the game and how beautiful it has become.  
We can now do this to such a big tract of land which will soon become the jewel of african wildlife and small scale, sustainable, safaris. But if it fails now I fear it is high risk this land will instead be turned into wheat and corn farming fighting battles with wildlife and cattle, often overgrazing and degrading the land into destruction.
Those who help us with contributions will get special rates on accommodation. We want to show you this beautiful land and its fantastic wildlife and its fascinating  maasai culture. Think, if you sponsor just 70 USD it will go straight to one maasai family and it will help securing this land and its wildlife for the future!

<p>Help me save a

<p>LAS RAÍCES DEL
MAR is a timely documentary about the
vibrant mangrove forests of the coast of Colima, their contribution to marine
and terrestrial life, and their precarious future.  Focusing on the mangrove estuaries around the
port city of Manzanillo, we learn of the incredible variety of life that
mangrove supports, from simple shellfish, to birds and mammals, to the fish caught
offshore on which we survive.  Under
threat by development, we learn about creative alternatives to mangrove
destruction in which mangrove lagoons are transformed into bioreserves. </p>
<p>All of these lagoons
are in a state of peril.  much is agressive
destruction for commercial development. We focus in particular on the Port
expansion project in Manzanillo and the Laguna de Juluapan, cut in half by a
1980's real estate development project that failed.  We document how mangrove
destruction affects local fishermen, who are now netting a fraction of their
original catch.</p>
<p>But there is
hope.  There are programs to revitalize lagoons, such as La Laguna del
Valle de Las Garzas.  Caught between
urban runoff and the encroaching Port of Manzanillo, there are programs in place
to keep it dredged and open it as a municipal park.  We visit the manglars
of Palo Verde, a protected reserve open for tourists to visit a mangrove
community.</p>
<p>We have
much material filmed.   Now begins the editing process and the
all-important Premier, after which we will screen the film at national and
international festivals.  But it is here
where your support is so critical.  THE
MESSAGE, THE MISSION, IS THERE.  The
country has just been through the tragedy of Tajamar in Quintana Roo, where
developers, backed by police forces, cynically flattened over 50 hectares of
healthy mangrove.  But an informed
population is fighting back, and there is an injunction against development in
Tajamar.  I need help putting this
project on the road…  to save mangrove,
we need to get the international community, particularly where they appreciate
the presence of migratory animals, aware of how important this thin coastal
forest is.</p>
<p><br/>
THIS HAS BEEN ENTIRELY SELF-FUNDED BY ME, JAMES KURTZ.  In 2007, I began to trench abandoned roadway
in order to flood the Laguna de Juluapan. 
To date, I have helped restore ten acres of ruined lagoon while risking
arrest.  But if you see the story of
mangrove, you will see why such unauthorized actions are critical. Killing mangrove kills
fisheries.</p>

<h3><b>Please Join Nepal Earthquake Disaster Relief</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Dear Precious Loving Ones,</p>
<p>As you know, on April 25th Nepal was struck by a devastating 7.8 earthquake, and again on April 12th by a 7.3 magnitude aftershock. We, the Dzogchen Shri Singha Foundation USA, are now helping through Buddhist Master Geydak Rinpoche in Nepal.</p>
<p>Now, many organizations and individuals are helping the earthquake relief efforts in Nepal, but there is still a great shortage of aid because more than eight million people are affected. More than three million people are suffering from a shortage of food, medicine, clothes, and accommodations. More than 14,000 have been seriously injured and there are not enough medical facilities to help them. 7,200 people have died and this number may increase still. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Our temple in Godawari and the monks’ living quarters have also been damaged, and some of our monks have been injured.</span></p>
<p>A lot of Nepali villages were struck so severely that not even a single house remains standing. Many of these villages are not accessible by vehicles. Rescue or aid has not reached a lot of these remote areas. Now the weather is very bad, and there will be a lot of rain or snow in the coming weeks and months. Many people are suffering and crying for help.</p>
<p>In order to ease the pains of the Nepali people, Geydak Rinpoche and our Sangha, already in Nepal, have been compassionately helping these affected people every day since the initial quake. We have already helped more than 40,000 people with basic disaster relief, traveling to more than 64 villages in remote areas. We so rejoice in what they are doing. </p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>A Renewed Effort</b></h3>At this time, the Dzogchen Shri Singha Foundation wants to raise money to support this aid project in Nepal. Everyone, please support this loving compassionate act. As a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, every dollar you donate is eligible for tax deduction according to the full extent of the law. <p>100% of your donations will go directly to the people of Nepal for relief effort with no intermediaries. </p>
<p>Right now we are trying to provide over 1,000 families with basic shelters for the summer rainy season and the harsh weather of winter to come. </p>
<p><span>Of course we cannot support everyone in Nepal, but we must do our part. </span></p>
<p><span>It makes a big difference. </span></p>

</div></div>","Please Join Nepal Earthquake Disaster Relief

Dear Precious Loving Ones,
As you know, on April 25th Nepal was struck by a devastating 7.8 earthquake, and again on April 12th by a 7.3 magnitude aftershock. We, the Dzogchen Shri Singha Foundation USA, are now helping through Buddhist Master Geydak Rinpoche in Nepal.
Now, many organizations and individuals are helping the earthquake relief efforts in Nepal, but there is still a great shortage of aid because more than eight million people are affected. More than three million people are suffering from a shortage of food, medicine, clothes, and accommodations. More than 14,000 have been seriously injured and there are not enough medical facilities to help them. 7,200 people have died and this number may increase still. Our temple in Godawari and the monks’ living quarters have also been damaged, and some of our monks have been injured.
A lot of Nepali villages were struck so severely that not even a single house remains standing. Many of these villages are not accessible by vehicles. Rescue or aid has not reached a lot of these remote areas. Now the weather is very bad, and there will be a lot of rain or snow in the coming weeks and months. Many people are suffering and crying for help.
In order to ease the pains of the Nepali people, Geydak Rinpoche and our Sangha, already in Nepal, have been compassionately helping these affected people every day since the initial quake. We have already helped more than 40,000 people with basic disaster relief, traveling to more than 64 villages in remote areas. We so rejoice in what they are doing. 

A Renewed EffortAt this time, the Dzogchen Shri Singha Foundation wants to raise money to support this aid project in Nepal. Everyone, please support this loving compassionate act. As a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, every dollar you donate is eligible for tax deduction according to the full extent of the law. 100% of your donations will go directly to the people of Nepal for relief effort with no intermediaries. 
Right now we are trying to provide over 1,000 families with basic shelters for the summer rainy season and the harsh weather of winter to come. 
Of course we cannot support everyone in Nepal, but we must do our part. 
It makes a big difference. 
So far, we have distributed critical supplies and tools such as:
1.) 1,300 tents 2.) 10,000 shovels 3.) 1,000 hammers 4.) 2,500 pounds of nails5.) 130,000 pounds of rice 
And other essential medicines and various necessities such as shoes and clothes to those areas in greatest need. We have also provided hundreds of hot meals everyday to those who were injured.    What Help We Need Now Since the initial earthquake, Geydak Rinpoche, his monks, and volunteers have been tirelessly working every day to bring much needed supplies. We are renting two trucks to carry the tons of rice and other supplies to the remote areas of Nepal where help is rarely received.

Geydak Rinpoche has ordered many supplies such as rice and tents from India to make sure that our donations go directly to the mouths, over the heads, and upon the feet of those who are in most need. 
Facing Weather Challenges
 Now that the monsoon season has begun, the worst case scenario is setting in, and the race to ensure shelter and lasting recovery is deepening.

 You have the power to make a difference in the lives of others in a most desperate time. Your compassionate generosity can bring great relief to the people of Nepal! If you do not choose to donate through our Foundation, please help in any way possible.

May all beings be free from suffering and the causes of suffering!May all beings have happiness and the causes of happiness!

Meet the sharks
EDUCATION & OUTREACH


For many children & adults who visit our Shark Lab, this is the first time they will meet sharks face-to-face.  Having been exposed to endless negative media about these animals, a surprising number of visitors are terrified of sharks - even the small and relatively inactive sharks housed in our aquarium.  In a country where wildlife poaching (even in the ocean) is rampant we endeavor to create a lasting positive experience that changes perceptions and attitudes.  Using a hands-on, experiential approach our goals are to inspire passion and respect for ocean ecosystems and animals.
RESEARCH
Research in the Shark Lab is focused on the behaviour & ecology of small sharks found nowhere else in the world.  We provide more than 70 interns & students each year with the opportunity to conduct hands-on shark research, building critical skills for future careers as marine scientists.  Sharks housed in the Shark Lab tanks are kept for a maximum of 3 months & then released back into the ocean.

‘There is still time to save our forests. By buying our album you will
contribute to protecting our forests, to supporting our farmers, and to leaving
something for our children. I call on everyone to join the movement Sing 4
Comoros Forests!’
Campaign Ambassador Maalesh
(winner of the 1995
RFI World Music prize and 2007 Indian Ocean prize).


The Comoro Islands suffered the highest rate of deforestation in the
world between 2000 and 2010, causing huge problems for the population. Imagine that you can help to reforest the Comoros just by listening to
music. Because by buying a new album that brings together many of the
best-known Comorian musicians, you can! The proceeds from the campaign will go
to supporting the NGO Dahari’s work to save water resources,
improve the livelihoods of rural communities, and conserve the Critically
Endangered Livingstone’s fruit bat. 
If we raise 60,000 dollars through this campaign we will be able to
support communities to plant 150,000 trees in 2016.

On the island
  of Anjouan
the environmental problems are clearly visible: only about 10 of 50 previously
permanent rivers remain and agricultural yields are in sharp decline. A vicious
circle has set in with poverty leading to increased deforestation and
vice-versa. The situation is so desperate that hundreds of people die each year
trying to make the crossing to the French-administered island of Mayotte in the hope of
a better future. 







The NGO Dahari (meaning ‘Sustainable’) has developed a package of tools that empower
communities to halt deforestation while securing better livelihoods and
wellbeing. Created at the beginning of 2013, Dahari has already:



Supported over 3500 of the poorest Comorians to increase their income from farming;


Developed the first ever forest management
initiatives for the country to protect key water resources and biodiversity
hotspots;


Garnered unprecedented international support, with technical and financial partnerships with over 30 institutions
from Madagascar, France, the UK,
Australia, the Netherlands, and the US.









We need your help to reforest the Comoros. You
can help Dahari plant 150,000 trees with local communities in 2016: 



fruit trees and trees grown for timber and
fuel to boost farmers’ income,


fast-growing tree species to form erosion
breaks and provide fodder for cattle,


indigenous trees to protect water sources and
provide feeding resources for endemic biodiversity.


This is a unique opportunity to help save the forests
of the Comoros whilst
enjoying some fantastic local music. Please
give generously!

This charity album
is an initiative from Dahari and Ouvoimoja, a Comorian band
that brings together the most talented musicians on the island of Anjouan.
Ouvoimoja’s music, a fusion of reggae, folk and Comorian mgodro, focuses on both the beauty and harsh reality of life in the
islands.

Many of the most
famous Comorian musicians are joining forces to support the campaign and will
feature on the album, which will include the 3 songs from Ouvoimoja : Walozi (the fishermen), Rilemewa (we are tired) and Ulanga (the nature).
Already signed up: Maalesh, Eliasse, Cheikh MC, Mounawar, DadiPoslim, Costy, Goulam, Nawal.









80% of the money will go directly to support
Dahari’s core field programmes to reforest the Comoros in order to conserve
water resources, boost farmer incomes, and conserve the Livingstone’s fruit
bat.


10% will go towards creating the album and ensuring
it is heard in every village in the Comoros through a communications campaign
involving concerts and the distribution of CDs.


The final 10% will go towards the admin costs,
including site fees at 8% and delivery of rewards.

<p>Guests
are invited to participate in a multi-sensory experience by dressing as their

on the film subject, which we will select. For example, “Animalia in the
Forests” or “Animalia Under the Sea”.</p>
<p>Each
event will be free and will feature roving flora and fauna characters, smoking

<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>

<p>Any

<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>We all

</li> </ul> <p>We have had many successes. Right now, the key is getting more brilliant people into the cloud forest to fall in love with the forest and her people.  Many Guatemalans are now asking if they can join us and need some financial support to cover their costs of travel, food, lodging, and conservation efforts.  Ask yourself: can you help CFCI make this happen?</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>CFCI's campaign for the 2016 year is simple:</p> <ul> <li>We need to raise $1,500.00 to help underwrite the cost of several native Guatemalans to participate in the eco-trek and to continue these conservation efforts. Any extra money will be funneled into sustainable community development projects, conservation research into threatened and endangered species, and more.  <br/>
</li> <li>We are excited to offer multiple perks such as CFCI conservation coffee mugs, reusable CFCI shopping bags, Mayan weaves, and for large donations: a seat on the eco-trek (or a gift seat for a friend or family).<br/>

The farm will have trails, gardens, amphitheater, venue spaces, and serve as a cold-climate demonstration homestead. It's called GledeGaard - roughly translated, means Happy Farm.</p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The Why</strong></h2><p><u>For Love and Happiness </u>- GledeGaard is a dedication to natural simplicity, knowledge and creating  good for the community and those who will take over after us - our children [including floofs - aka other living creatures]. Through permaculture design, the farm gives back to the world not only by being sustainable, but also by <u><strong>regenerating</strong></u> natural resources like cleaner air, water and fertile soils. <strong>Our Mission</strong> is to contribute to The Happy Planet Index by reducing our ecological footprint and increasing happiness through our services and permaculture methods.</p><p>All within the beautiful Norwegian landscape.</p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Where are the Contributions going?</strong></h2><p>The funds are going to the purchase &amp; final design of the property (88%), while the rest goes to IndieGoGo/PayPal processing fees (10%) and Perks (2%).</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483102220/wtijow1th9ld2cje2scc.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 455px;height: 295px;""/></p><p> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>You might ask, ""What's in it for me?""</strong></h2><p><u>Would you say you like breathing clean air, drinking clean water, eating yummy food, nature, farm stays, permaculture, local business, art or academia?</u> You would get to <strong>directly and intimately </strong>support a project that inspires and maintains values you cherish, things of interest and the environment. Additionally, your contributions have a lasting effect on future generations and many of the features on the farm will be dedicated to those who supported its establishment.</p><p><strong>Our Vision</strong> is to create and demonstrate lifestyles where human happiness and well-being does not cost the Earth, our ultimate scarce and finite resource.</p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What will be on the farm?</strong></h2><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483747335/rvzsjgvzkagsst67lavc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p><p>Its <u>permaculture</u> functional design will allow visitors to incorporate 5 daily actions that lead to well-being and happiness. We are looking to implement the following as the property allows:</p><ul>
<li>
<u>1)<strong> Be Active</strong></u>: activity areas to get you moving – Obstacle, orientation and parkour course; Wheelchair accessible walking/biking/skiing paths</li>
<li>
<u>2) <strong>Be Connected</strong></u>: gathering areas to keep you close to the people you cherish – Barn with ‘tiny house’ rooms and venue space; Farm-stay cabins; Camping areas; Fire-pits; Amphitheater; 4 season Garden – also wheelchair accessible</li>
<li>
<u>3) <strong>Be Mindful</strong>:</u> opportunities to interact with your surroundings – Farm animal contact; Wild nature contact; Natural resource awareness; Organic farming methods</li>
<li>
<u>4) <strong>Be Curious</strong>:</u> stimulation for your mind – Hidden trails; Nordic rune signs; Art in the landscape; Workshops; Labyrinth market garden; Research &amp; Development</li>
<li>
<u>5) <strong>Be Generous</strong>:</u> a system that nurtures altruistic giving – Pay it forward farm-stays for others; Assisting less-able visitors; Donation (books, funds, time, etc); Volunteer to help around the farm  and gain farm experience (WWOOFing)</li>
</ul><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Will there be animals?</strong></h3><p>Cows, sheep, goats, pigs, chickens, rabbits, hedgehogs, ducks, farm cat, farm dog and farmer are the animals that we are looking to have on the property. Depending on property allowances, climate and vet care, we will be able to have most if not all of them.</p><p><strong>Our philosophy</strong> is to revere the balance of Nature, create symbiotic relationships with creatures in our habitat and be stewards acting in reflection of our philosophy.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483103600/elxivottxvsrrvcpdkx6.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 314px;height: 242px;""/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What will the farm produce?</h3><p>The farm will primarily provide services associated with venues, such as farm-stays, workshops, internships, and data collection. The homestead will maintain farming adequate to meet the needs of the people working on the farm.

As properties are publicly for sale, we are up against other very competitive bidders, for example - established commercial farms with excess capital. Additionally, banks are hesitant to take on the risk of a farm property concerning resale. Oddly enough, not everyone wants to be a farmer. Therefore, we have taken steps to ensure we can give a competitive offer and meet the financial institutions halfway.</p><ul>
<li>We have amassed support in advance to ensure the best possibility for campaign success</li>
<li>We will match the first 15,000USD in contributions.</li>
<li>We have also applied for grants and funding that will be granted upon property purchase</li>
<li>We have assembled a team over experienced tradesmen, engineers, designers, investors and farmer who have committed their time, income and resources to establishing this farm</li>
<li>We have cut down on perks that require shipping, while retaining value to contributors - Shipping in and from Norway is very costly and would detract greatly form the contributions of backers</li>
<li>The start-up schedule is conservative so that we can establish a solid profitable infrastructure with minimal risk to the project</li>
<li>The revenue designated to support the farm start-up has been insured in the event of injury, illness or death.</li>
<li>We have baby floof picture...so so sooo cute.</li>

Anyone who says otherwise may be picking your pockets.</p><p>It is through the many products and opportunities of the farm that contribute to the well-being that happiness is obtained. We didn't think of this lightly with unrealistic idealistic optimism.  The pioneers of this concept is the New Economics Foundation (NEF) with their <u>Happy Planet Index (HPI)</u>. Their statisticians have done extensive research, calculations and published the information for improving businesses and informing the public. The HPI, in conjunction with our Holistic Management, is the foundation and control used to present and measure our happiness product. The farms activities are created to allow people to exercise the 5 actions identified to increase well-being´, and thereby increase their happiness.</p><p>**For those curious folks wanting to know more, here is an extremely informative video about HPI put out by the NEF of their presentation for a TED talk.</p><div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1o3FS0awtk?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">How you can help</h2><p><u>Contribute</u> to our campaign to further this project <u>and share it</u> on social media and email.

Siden eiendommer ligger ute for salg i offentligheten byr vi mot andre, konkurransedyktige kjøpere, for eksempel etablerte kommersielle gårder med ekstra kapital. I tillegg er banker uvillige til å risikere å gi store lån til små gårdseiendommer av frykt for at de ikke vil bli solgt videre. Merkelig nok er det ikke alle som vil være bønder. Derfor har vi gjort det vi kan for å forsikre at vi kan legge inn et konkurransedyktig bud og møte bankene halvveis.</p><ul>
<li>Vi har skaffet støtte i forkant for å forsikre oss om høyest mulig suksess for kampanjen</li>
<li>Vi vil matche de første 15,000 USD i bidrag.</li>
<li>Vi har søkt på stipend og finansiering som vil bli gitt oss når vi kjøper eiendommen.</li>
<li>Vi har satt sammen et lag av erfarne håndverkere, ingeniører, designere, investorer og bønder som vil bruke tid og inntekt til å etablere denne gården.</li>

 - ÍSLENSKUR texti væntanlegur********************************************The Who and WhatHello Everyone! Tavonna Nira & Guðjón Örn here. With our team of tradesmen, engineers and specialists we are starting a farm in Norway where people can visit, stay & experience activities that promote well-being. The farm will have trails, gardens, amphitheater, venue spaces, and serve as a cold-climate demonstration homestead. It's called GledeGaard - roughly translated, means Happy Farm.The WhyFor Love and Happiness - GledeGaard is a dedication to natural simplicity, knowledge and creating  good for the community and those who will take over after us - our children [including floofs - aka other living creatures]. Through permaculture design, the farm gives back to the world not only by being sustainable, but also by regenerating natural resources like cleaner air, water and fertile soils. Our Mission is to contribute to The Happy Planet Index by reducing our ecological footprint and increasing happiness through our services and permaculture methods.All within the beautiful Norwegian landscape.Where are the Contributions going?The funds are going to the purchase & final design of the property (88%), while the rest goes to IndieGoGo/PayPal processing fees (10%) and Perks (2%). You might ask, ""What's in it for me?""Would you say you like breathing clean air, drinking clean water, eating yummy food, nature, farm stays, permaculture, local business, art or academia? You would get to directly and intimately support a project that inspires and maintains values you cherish, things of interest and the environment. Additionally, your contributions have a lasting effect on future generations and many of the features on the farm will be dedicated to those who supported its establishment.Our Vision is to create and demonstrate lifestyles where human happiness and well-being does not cost the Earth, our ultimate scarce and finite resource.What will be on the farm?Its permaculture functional design will allow visitors to incorporate 5 daily actions that lead to well-being and happiness. We are looking to implement the following as the property allows:

1) Be Active: activity areas to get you moving – Obstacle, orientation and parkour course; Wheelchair accessible walking/biking/skiing paths

2) Be Connected: gathering areas to keep you close to the people you cherish – Barn with ‘tiny house’ rooms and venue space; Farm-stay cabins; Camping areas; Fire-pits; Amphitheater; 4 season Garden – also wheelchair accessible

3) Be Mindful: opportunities to interact with your surroundings – Farm animal contact; Wild nature contact; Natural resource awareness; Organic farming methods

4) Be Curious: stimulation for your mind – Hidden trails; Nordic rune signs; Art in the landscape; Workshops; Labyrinth market garden; Research & Development

5) Be Generous: a system that nurtures altruistic giving – Pay it forward farm-stays for others; Assisting less-able visitors; Donation (books, funds, time, etc); Volunteer to help around the farm  and gain farm experience (WWOOFing)
Will there be animals?Cows, sheep, goats, pigs, chickens, rabbits, hedgehogs, ducks, farm cat, farm dog and farmer are the animals that we are looking to have on the property. Depending on property allowances, climate and vet care, we will be able to have most if not all of them.Our philosophy is to revere the balance of Nature, create symbiotic relationships with creatures in our habitat and be stewards acting in reflection of our philosophy.What will the farm produce?The farm will primarily provide services associated with venues, such as farm-stays, workshops, internships, and data collection. The homestead will maintain farming adequate to meet the needs of the people working on the farm. Later we are seeking to expand this to farm-to-table products, and should the local market and farm capacity allow, we will participate in local markets and CSAs.The Current ChallengesTime is of the essence. As properties are publicly for sale, we are up against other very competitive bidders, for example - established commercial farms with excess capital. Additionally, banks are hesitant to take on the risk of a farm property concerning resale. Oddly enough, not everyone wants to be a farmer. Therefore, we have taken steps to ensure we can give a competitive offer and meet the financial institutions halfway.
We have amassed support in advance to ensure the best possibility for campaign success
We will match the first 15,000USD in contributions.
We have also applied for grants and funding that will be granted upon property purchase
We have assembled a team over experienced tradesmen, engineers, designers, investors and farmer who have committed their time, income and resources to establishing this farm
We have cut down on perks that require shipping, while retaining value to contributors - Shipping in and from Norway is very costly and would detract greatly form the contributions of backers
The start-up schedule is conservative so that we can establish a solid profitable infrastructure with minimal risk to the project
The revenue designated to support the farm start-up has been insured in the event of injury, illness or death.
We have baby floof picture...so so sooo cute.
Can one have Happiness as a product?We think so.While we wish we could bottle up some happiness and sell it in charming brown paper packages, happiness cannot be produced in that sense. Anyone who says otherwise may be picking your pockets.It is through the many products and opportunities of the farm that contribute to the well-being that happiness is obtained. We didn't think of this lightly with unrealistic idealistic optimism.  The pioneers of this concept is the New Economics Foundation (NEF) with their Happy Planet Index (HPI). Their statisticians have done extensive research, calculations and published the information for improving businesses and informing the public. The HPI, in conjunction with our Holistic Management, is the foundation and control used to present and measure our happiness product. The farms activities are created to allow people to exercise the 5 actions identified to increase well-being´, and thereby increase their happiness.**For those curious folks wanting to know more, here is an extremely informative video about HPI put out by the NEF of their presentation for a TED talk.How you can helpContribute to our campaign to further this project and share it on social media and email. We have designed perks we believe you will love that make you an everlasting part of our farm.We understand not everyone can give financially, so we ask that you share this on social media and more importantly via email. By emailing, you are making a more intimate contribution and people respond to genuine communication.Please feel free to give us your ideas and suggestions for perks. We would love to hear from you and most definitely wish you to visit the farm.Our Sincerest Gratitude and Well Wishes,
Tavonna & Guðjón
 Additional information:GledeGaard's Organization number: 911 721 821**************************************Hjelp oss å starte GledeGaardStøtt etableringen av en gård som gror glede for familie, venner, lokalmiljøet og naturen. Little lady, Big Guy, og snart kommende, Wee baby, vil kjøpe en gård for å starte et gårdsbruk, en boplass, og for å gro litt glede i de norske åsene.Bli med på prosjektet og reisen med dine bidrag, og belønninger som vil bli en evigvarende del av gården vår, og verden.**De første 130,000NOK donert, blir matchet (kroner for kroner) takket være GledeGaards Velgjørere** Hvem og HvaTavonna Nira og Guðjón Örn her. Med vårt lag av håndverkere, ingeniører og spesialister skal vi etablere en gård i Norge, hvor folk kan besøke, overnatte og delta i aktiviteter som promoterer velvære. Gården vil ha stier, hager, et amfi, møteplasser, og fungere som en demonstrasjon av kald-klima demonstrasjonsgårdsbruk. Gården heter GledeGaard.HvorforFor kjærlighet og lykke – GledeGaard er hengivenhet til naturlig enkelhet, kunnskap, og det å lage noe godt for de som tar over for oss, barna våre (inkludert floofs – andre levende vesen). Fordi gården er designet etter permakulturprinsipper gir den tilbake til verden ved å både være bærekraftig, og ved å regenerere naturressurser, som renere luft, rent vann og fruktbar jord. Målet til GledeGaard er å bidra til å bedre samfunnet (lokalt, regionalt og internasjonalt) gjennom naturen og naturens produkter.Alt innenfor det vakre norske landskapet.Hvor går ditt bidragMesteparten av bidragene går til kjøp og endelig design av eiendommen (88%), og resten går til behandlingsgebyr hos IndieGoGo/Paypal (10%), og belønningene (2%).Du spør kanskje, ”Hvorfor er dette viktig for meg?”Vil du si at du liker å puste frisk luft, drikke rent vann, spise god mat, naturen, overnatting på gård, permakultur, lokalt næringsliv, kunst eller utdanning? Ved å støtte GledeGaard støtter du et prosjekt som inspirerer og opprettholder verdier du setter høyt, ting du interesserer deg for, og miljøet. Dine bidrag vil også ha en varig effekt på kommende generasjoner, og mange av særtrekkene til gården vil være dedikert til de som bidro til etableringen av gården.Hva vil være på gården?Gårdens permakulturdesign vil la besøkende delta i fem daglige aktiviteter som leder til velvære og lykke. Vi håper å implementere de følgende ettersom hva eiendommen tillater.

Vær aktiv: aktivitetsområder som setter deg i bevegelse – hinderløype, orientering og parkour bane; gå/sykkel/ski-løyper som også er tilgjengelige med rullestol.

Vær koblet til: samlingsområder der du kan være nær folk du verdsetter – låve med rom, og møtelokaler; gårdovernattingshytter; campingområde; bålplasser/grillesteder; amfi; helårshage; også tilgjengelig for rullestol

Vær oppmerksom: Mulighet til å samhandle med omgivelsene; kontakt med gårdsdyr; kontakt med vill natur; bevissthet om naturressurser; organisk jordbruk.

Vær nysgjerrig: Stimulering for hjernen – Gjemte stier; Nordiske runemerker; kunst i landskapet; Workshops; labyrinthage; Forskning og utvikling

Vær generøs: et system som nærer altruistisk giverglede; ”pay it forward” gårdsopphold for andre; man hjelper besøkende med nedsatt funksjonsevne; donasjon (bøker, penger, tid, etc.); Melde seg frivillig til å hjelpe til på gården og få gårdserfaring (WWOOFing).
Kommer det til å være dyr på gården?Dyrene vi planlegger å ha på eiendommen er kyr, sauer, geiter, griser, kyllinger, kaniner, piggsvin, ender, gårdskatt, gårdshund og bønder. Avhengig av eiendommen, klima og veterinærtjenester i området planlegger vi å ha så mange som mulig, om ikke alle dyrene.Hva kommer gården til å produsere?Gården vil primært fokusere på tjenester som lokaler som kan brukes til gårdsovernatting, workshops, praktikantstillinger, og datainnsamling. Gården vil opprettholde gårdsbruk som møter behovene til de som bor og jobber på gården. Senere håper vi å utvide dette til gård-til-bord-produkter og, hvis lokalmarkedet og gårdskapasiteten strekker til vil vi delta på lokale markeder og CSAs (lokalsamfunn støttet landbruk).Utfordringene vi har nå.Tiden løper fra oss. Siden eiendommer ligger ute for salg i offentligheten byr vi mot andre, konkurransedyktige kjøpere, for eksempel etablerte kommersielle gårder med ekstra kapital. I tillegg er banker uvillige til å risikere å gi store lån til små gårdseiendommer av frykt for at de ikke vil bli solgt videre. Merkelig nok er det ikke alle som vil være bønder. Derfor har vi gjort det vi kan for å forsikre at vi kan legge inn et konkurransedyktig bud og møte bankene halvveis.
Vi har skaffet støtte i forkant for å forsikre oss om høyest mulig suksess for kampanjen
Vi vil matche de første 15,000 USD i bidrag.
Vi har søkt på stipend og finansiering som vil bli gitt oss når vi kjøper eiendommen.
Vi har satt sammen et lag av erfarne håndverkere, ingeniører, designere, investorer og bønder som vil bruke tid og inntekt til å etablere denne gården.
Vi har kuttet ned på belønninger (perks) som sendes steder, men som er av en god verdi for bidragsytere. – Postsendinger i og ut av Norge er dyrt og vil forringe verdien av det bidragsyterne kan donere siden mer penger ville gått til postsendinger.
Timeplanen for start er konservative slik at vi kan etablere en solid og lønnsom infrastruktur med minimal risk for prosjektet.
Inntektene øremerket til oppstart av gården er forsikret i tilfelle skade, sykdom eller død.
Vi har bilder av baby floofs…. Så så såååå søte.
Kan man ha lykke som et produkt?Vi mener det. Samtidig som vi skulle ønske vi kunne solgt lykke på flasker i brune papirposer kan ikke lykke produseres på den måten. Hvis noen sier de kan det er det mulig de prøver å rane deg.Det er gjennom de mange produktene og mulighetene på gården som bidrar til velvære at lykken kommer. Vi ser ikke lett på dette, og heller ikke med urealistisk, idealistisk optimisme. Pionerne for dette konseptet er New Economics Foundation (NEF) som har en egen Lykkelig Planet Indeks (Happy Planet Index, HPI).

She wants to pursue a sustainable way of living on the farm.  The project started in 2012. In 2015, Alvany planted 750 trees with the help of friends and neighbors. By the end of 2016 more than a thousand trees had been planted. The neighbors, childhood friends and also the NGO Gana have been helping to develop educational activities there. The activities have included ecological walks and we have plans to build a museum of natural history and a library.The climate is tropical and the weather is hottest from November to April. However, with trees the climate feels very nice.It is still early days. Further plans include making use of renewable energy, collecting rainwater, composting toilets, food system integration, rocket stove, natural furniture, and using recycled materials as much as possible, resorting to the principles of a circular economy. We also want to build a tree house, as a way to get more children involved with nature activities. And then there is the big goal of recovering the sources of water. Who are we?Ville and Alvany are just two friends who met in England. Alvany is a sociologist from Brazil who changed career after living in the USA for four years. She decided to be a teacher and ended up becoming a professor. She has traveled extensively and is now setting a place to work with environment education and preservation. She is working to restore land and water. Ville is a physicist from Finland, helping with the project, as a gift for Alvany's birthday.Isabel is Alvany's sister and her neighbor, who owns a piece of land as well and has been of great support.We would appreciate if you logged in to the blog and left your support and wishes.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Next steps
Further steps have to be done: Finding strategic partners, social
 media communication, advertising and getting proofed certificates. Of 
course we still have to put money into our Gap-Cap.Each day we are doing the very best to bring the Gap-Cap up from the bottom but now the time has come: We need your help!We love our worldIf
 you love our world like we do then please help us. Let´s bring this 
project into success so that our Gap-Cap is soon a naturalness, because

<h3>I Need Your Help to Solve The Climate Crisis</h3>
<p>My name is Andrew Grant Houston, however my friends call me Ace, and you can help me solve the climate crisis. I am a licensed architect based here in Seattle, a Texan born and raised, and the founder of my own architecture practice House Cosmopolitan. I am contacting you today because I need your help.</p>
<p>According to the Environmental Energy and Study Institute, in the United States nearly 40% of carbon emissions come from our buildings: which includes the materials used, the energy used to construct them, and the biggest chunk, the use of those buildings. Architects like myself and other building professionals have made reductions in energy usage over the last decade, with over a 20% reduction in carbon emissions from 2005-2015, however my industry only has 10 years to make an 80% reduction in carbon emissions. So how can I personally make sure we hit our target?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Passive House!</h3>
<p>Passive House is a building certification created in Germany that aims to reduce energy usage in a home / office / any type of building by at least 75% and as much as 90%! This then allows that last 25-10% to be offset by renewable resources and potentially achieve net-zero energy usage. I want to become a Certified Passive House Designer so every single project I work on moving forward gets us closer to a sustainable solution against the climate crisis.</p>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Ask</span></h3>
<p>Your next question: why is an architect asking for money? I thought architects made a lot of money! Short answer is no, I just started my own practice this year and though things are going generally OK making this investment would not be cheap. But as we know from the climate strike and what scientists are telling us, the cost of inaction is even higher and I want to make the most impact as quickly as possible and to do so with every project that I work on.</p> <p>I am raising $3500 and that covers the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A week-long intensive Passive House Certification Course, which is located in the Bay Area (there isn’t one closer), that also covers the cost of taking the certification exam as well as the cost of being certified for five years</li>
<li>Air travel and housing for the week, including carbon offsets</li>
<li>All the lovely Indiegogo fees</li>
</ul>
<p>I also have 2 Stretch Goals, that would make an even bigger impact:</p>
<ul>
<li>If I get to $4000 I will make a video of my journey to help spread the word about Passive House and my journey to becoming certified</li>
<li>If I raise an additional $2000 doals (6K total) then I will create a FREE course done digitally so others can become certified as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Particularly given all the work that is happening around the <strong>Green New Deal</strong> in the US, I want to do my part in educating as many people as possible to help empower them to not only become consultants and designers of passive house projects but also be able to enter into the new green economy.</p> <h3><strong><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">What's in it for you? The Perks.</span></strong></h3>
<p>Perks start from a simple thank you and go all the way to a seat in the potential online course!</p>

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By simply getting certified and with a goal of designing at least 10,000SF each year, that would mean: </p>
<ul>
<li>More than 10,000SF will either be certified or designed to Passive House standards</li>
<li>Up to 3,000 metric tons of CO2 will NOT be produced for the life of those buildings</li>
<li>Net-zero energy on all projects will be a reasonable target</li>
</ul>
<p>With teaching a course for 30 people, those numbers could quickly multiply to drive down carbon emissions even faster!</p>

<p>I’m Domenica Busetti and like you all I have a place that is really close to my heart, a place that risks not to resist the passage of time. This place is the<strong> millenary Tower</strong> of Almese (Torre di Almese), collocated on the Via Francigena, at the foot of the Abbey “Sacra di San Michele”, near the city of Turin, and it represents a<strong> magnificent patrimony for the history</strong> of our Country, testimony of events that have built our past.</p>
<p>The Tower accuses the passing of time on the external walls and requires a <strong>conservative restoration</strong>. This is why, by linking the past with the future, the “<i>Fondazione Salva la Torre</i>” association was born, in order to raise funds to <strong>restructure and maintain</strong> this little wonder of our history, <strong>the history of everyone</strong>.</p>
<p>I ask everyone for help! We all have the opportunity to save a place with an important historical and artistic value, but above all a place that has been at the heart of many people. <strong>Together</strong> we can make the difference and bring the Tower to become a witness of history in the future, for <strong>another thousand years</strong>.</p>

<p>Sono Domenica Bussetti e come voi ho un luogo che mi sta molto a cuore, un luogo che rischia di non resistere al passaggio del tempo. Questo posto è la <strong>Torre </strong><strong>millenaria</strong> di Almese, situata sulla Via Francigena, ai piedi dell'Abbazia ""Sacra di San Michele"", vicino alla città di Torino, e rappresenta un magnifico<strong> </strong><strong>patrimonio</strong><strong> per la </strong><strong>storia</strong><strong> del </strong><strong>nostro</strong><strong> Paese</strong>, testimone di eventi che hanno costruito il nostro passato.</p>
<p>La Torre accusa il passare del tempo sulle pareti esterne e richiede un<strong> restauro conservativo</strong>. Ecco perché, collegando il passato con il futuro, è nata l'associazione ""Fondazione Salva la Torre"", al fine di raccogliere fondi per<strong> restaurare e mantenere</strong> questa piccola meraviglia della nostra storia, <strong>la storia di tutti</strong>.</p>
<p>Chiedo aiuto a tutti! Abbiamo tutti l'opportunità di salvare un luogo con un importante valore storico e artistico, ma soprattutto un luogo che è stato nel cuore di molte persone. <strong>Insieme </strong>possiamo fare la differenza e portare la Torre a diventare testimone della storia nel futuro, <strong>per altri mille anni</strong>.</p>

<p>The ""<i>Save the Tower Foundation</i>"" association has the purpose of raising funds for the <strong>restoration and the maintenance</strong> of this wonder of our history, the history of everyone.<br/>Years ago I decided to <strong>give the Tower free loan to the municipality</strong> of Almese because the whole community and tourists from<strong> all over the world could enjoy</strong> our historical and artistic heritage.</p>
<p>Thanks to the commitment of the municipality and the <strong>help of the volunteers</strong>, the tower can in fact be visited up to its seventh floor and the terrace and today is home to <strong>cultural events, exhibitions </strong><strong>and</strong><strong> artistic performances</strong>.<br/>Unfortunately, given the problems on external walls,<strong> the risk of falling </strong><strong>of</strong><strong> some fragments is real</strong> and it is necessary to put it in <strong>safety </strong>so that it can continue to be used by the community.</p>
<p>This is why I decided to give life to the crowdfunding campaign, in order to raise funds for the most <strong>urgent recovery interventions</strong>.</p>
<p>This, unfortunately, is only a first step because <strong>the conservative restoration intervention is very big</strong>, but it is important because <strong>it would make it safe and usable again for years to come</strong>, allowing us to preserve the heritage of our fathers to future generations.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537201062/ir3ke8r4dffcp1tzevbt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>L’associazione “<i>Fondazione Salva la Torre</i>” ha lo scopo di raccogliere fondi per il <strong>restauro e il mantenimento</strong> di questa meraviglia della nostra storia, la storia di tutti.</p>
<p>Anni fa mi sono determinata a dare la Torre in <strong>comodato d’uso gratuito al comune</strong> di Almese perché tutta <strong>la comunità e i turisti da tutto il mondo potessero godere di questo nostro patrimonio</strong> storico e artistico. Grazie all’impegno del comune e all’aiuto dei<strong> volontari </strong>la torre è infatti visitabile fino al suo settimo piano e alla terrazza e oggi è <strong>sede di eventi culturali, mostre ed esibizioni artistiche</strong>.</p>
<p>Purtroppo, viste le problematiche sui muri esterni, <strong>il rischio di caduta di alcuni frammenti è reale</strong> ed è necessario metterla in <strong>sicurezza</strong> perché possa continuare ad essere usata dalla comunità.</p>
<p>Per questo ho deciso di dare vita alla campagna di crowdfunding, per poter raccogliere fondi per i più<strong> urgenti interventi di recupero</strong>.</p>
<p>Questo purtroppo è solo un primo passo perché<strong> l’intervento di restauro conservativo è molto grosso</strong>, ma è importante perché permetterebbe di<strong> renderla di nuovo sicura e utilizzabile da tutti per gli anni a venire</strong>, permettendo di conservare per le generazioni future l’eredità dei nostri padri.</p>

<p>Thanks to the help we receive, we will proceed with the<strong> restoration and security </strong>of the Tower, which we have already asked for some estimates.</p>
<p>We hope to get enough help to be able to ensure<strong> the safety of all facades</strong>, as this would <strong>reduce the costs for the restoration</strong>. For example, most of the cost involved in the intervention is represented by operations, such as the construction of scaffolding, which are necessary for each of the facades of the tower. However, if we do not reach the full amount necessary for a complete restoration of the tower, <strong>every contribution will be used for the maintenance and restoration of the Tower</strong>, starting from the smallest things to the most demanding jobs. Every contribution is important to us and helps us to envisage a better future for the tower. Details below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Upon reaching <strong>€ 40,000</strong> - Securing and renovation the most degraded portions of <strong>one facade</strong> ; </li>
<li>Upon reaching <strong>€ 60,000</strong> - Securing and renovation the most degraded portions of <strong>two facade </strong>; </li>
<li>Upon reaching <strong>€ 90,000</strong> - Securing and renovation the most degraded portions of <strong>three facade </strong>; </li>
<li>Upon reaching <strong>€ 120,000</strong> - Securing and renovation the most degraded portions of <strong>four facade </strong>; </li>
<li>Upon reaching <strong>€ 150,000</strong> - Securing and renovation the most degraded portions of <strong>four facade</strong> and Securing and consolidating <strong>the crowning of the terracotta arches</strong>.</li>

<p>Grazie all’aiuto che riceveremo, procederemo con il<strong> </strong><strong>restauro</strong><strong> e la </strong><strong>messa</strong><strong> in </strong><strong>sicurezza</strong> della Torre, di cui abbiamo già chiesto alcuni preventivi.</p>
<p>Speriamo di ottenere abbastanza aiuti da poter provvedere alla <strong>messa in sicurezza di tutte le facciate</strong>, poiché questo permetterebbe di diminuire i costi per il restauro. Ad esempio, la gran parte del costo previsto per l’intervento è rappresentata da operazioni, come la costruzione dei ponteggi, che sono necessarie per ognuna delle facciate della torre. Tuttavia, qualora non raggiungessimo l’intera cifra necessaria per un restauro completo della torre,<strong> ogni contributo verrà usato per il mantenimento e il restauro della Torre</strong>, partendo dalle cose più piccole ai lavori più impegnativi. Ogni contributo per noi è importante e ci aiuta a prospettare un migliore futuro per la torre. Di seguito i dettagli:</p>
<ol>
<li>Al raggiungimento di <strong>€ 40,000</strong> - Messa in sicurezza e restauro delle porzioni maggiormente degradate di <strong>una facciata</strong>; </li>
<li>Al raggiungimento di <strong>€ 60,000</strong> - Messa in sicurezza e restauro delle porzioni maggiormente degradate di <strong>due facciate</strong>; </li>
<li>Al raggiungimento di <strong>€ 90,000</strong> - Messa in sicurezza e restauro delle porzioni maggiormente degradate di <strong>tre facciate</strong>; </li>
<li>Al raggiungimento di <strong>€ 120,000</strong> - Messa in sicurezza e restauro delle porzioni maggiormente degradate di <strong>quattro facciate</strong>; </li>
<li>Al raggiungimento di <strong>€ 150,000</strong> - Messa in sicurezza e restauro delle porzioni maggiormente degradate di <strong>quattro facciate </strong>e Messa in sicurezza e consolidamento del coronamento<strong> degli archetti in cotto</strong>.</li>

This place is the millenary Tower of Almese (Torre di Almese), collocated on the Via Francigena, at the foot of the Abbey “Sacra di San Michele”, near the city of Turin, and it represents a magnificent patrimony for the history of our Country, testimony of events that have built our past.
The Tower accuses the passing of time on the external walls and requires a conservative restoration. This is why, by linking the past with the future, the “Fondazione Salva la Torre” association was born, in order to raise funds to restructure and maintain this little wonder of our history, the history of everyone.
I ask everyone for help! We all have the opportunity to save a place with an important historical and artistic value, but above all a place that has been at the heart of many people. Together we can make the difference and bring the Tower to become a witness of history in the future, for another thousand years.

Sono Domenica Bussetti e come voi ho un luogo che mi sta molto a cuore, un luogo che rischia di non resistere al passaggio del tempo. Questo posto è la Torre millenaria di Almese, situata sulla Via Francigena, ai piedi dell'Abbazia ""Sacra di San Michele"", vicino alla città di Torino, e rappresenta un magnifico patrimonio per la storia del nostro Paese, testimone di eventi che hanno costruito il nostro passato.
La Torre accusa il passare del tempo sulle pareti esterne e richiede un restauro conservativo. Ecco perché, collegando il passato con il futuro, è nata l'associazione ""Fondazione Salva la Torre"", al fine di raccogliere fondi per restaurare e mantenere questa piccola meraviglia della nostra storia, la storia di tutti.
Chiedo aiuto a tutti! Abbiamo tutti l'opportunità di salvare un luogo con un importante valore storico e artistico, ma soprattutto un luogo che è stato nel cuore di molte persone. Insieme possiamo fare la differenza e portare la Torre a diventare testimone della storia nel futuro, per altri mille anni.

 

An ancient story, the history of everyone

The ""Save the Tower Foundation"" association has the purpose of raising funds for the restoration and the maintenance of this wonder of our history, the history of everyone.Years ago I decided to give the Tower free loan to the municipality of Almese because the whole community and tourists from all over the world could enjoy our historical and artistic heritage.
Thanks to the commitment of the municipality and the help of the volunteers, the tower can in fact be visited up to its seventh floor and the terrace and today is home to cultural events, exhibitions and artistic performances.Unfortunately, given the problems on external walls, the risk of falling of some fragments is real and it is necessary to put it in safety so that it can continue to be used by the community.
This is why I decided to give life to the crowdfunding campaign, in order to raise funds for the most urgent recovery interventions.
This, unfortunately, is only a first step because the conservative restoration intervention is very big, but it is important because it would make it safe and usable again for years to come, allowing us to preserve the heritage of our fathers to future generations.

[ITALIAN]
L’associazione “Fondazione Salva la Torre” ha lo scopo di raccogliere fondi per il restauro e il mantenimento di questa meraviglia della nostra storia, la storia di tutti.
Anni fa mi sono determinata a dare la Torre in comodato d’uso gratuito al comune di Almese perché tutta la comunità e i turisti da tutto il mondo potessero godere di questo nostro patrimonio storico e artistico. Grazie all’impegno del comune e all’aiuto dei volontari la torre è infatti visitabile fino al suo settimo piano e alla terrazza e oggi è sede di eventi culturali, mostre ed esibizioni artistiche.
Purtroppo, viste le problematiche sui muri esterni, il rischio di caduta di alcuni frammenti è reale ed è necessario metterla in sicurezza perché possa continuare ad essere usata dalla comunità.
Per questo ho deciso di dare vita alla campagna di crowdfunding, per poter raccogliere fondi per i più urgenti interventi di recupero.
Questo purtroppo è solo un primo passo perché l’intervento di restauro conservativo è molto grosso, ma è importante perché permetterebbe di renderla di nuovo sicura e utilizzabile da tutti per gli anni a venire, permettendo di conservare per le generazioni future l’eredità dei nostri padri.

 

Your help, our thanks

Thanks to the help we receive, we will proceed with the restoration and security of the Tower, which we have already asked for some estimates.
We hope to get enough help to be able to ensure the safety of all facades, as this would reduce the costs for the restoration. For example, most of the cost involved in the intervention is represented by operations, such as the construction of scaffolding, which are necessary for each of the facades of the tower. However, if we do not reach the full amount necessary for a complete restoration of the tower, every contribution will be used for the maintenance and restoration of the Tower, starting from the smallest things to the most demanding jobs. Every contribution is important to us and helps us to envisage a better future for the tower. Details below:

Upon reaching € 40,000 - Securing and renovation the most degraded portions of one facade ; 
Upon reaching € 60,000 - Securing and renovation the most degraded portions of two facade ; 
Upon reaching € 90,000 - Securing and renovation the most degraded portions of three facade ; 
Upon reaching € 120,000 - Securing and renovation the most degraded portions of four facade ; 
Upon reaching € 150,000 - Securing and renovation the most degraded portions of four facade and Securing and consolidating the crowning of the terracotta arches.

Each goal achieved is a better future for the Tower!
 

[ITALIAN]
Grazie all’aiuto che riceveremo, procederemo con il restauro e la messa in sicurezza della Torre, di cui abbiamo già chiesto alcuni preventivi.
Speriamo di ottenere abbastanza aiuti da poter provvedere alla messa in sicurezza di tutte le facciate, poiché questo permetterebbe di diminuire i costi per il restauro. Ad esempio, la gran parte del costo previsto per l’intervento è rappresentata da operazioni, come la costruzione dei ponteggi, che sono necessarie per ognuna delle facciate della torre. Tuttavia, qualora non raggiungessimo l’intera cifra necessaria per un restauro completo della torre, ogni contributo verrà usato per il mantenimento e il restauro della Torre, partendo dalle cose più piccole ai lavori più impegnativi. Ogni contributo per noi è importante e ci aiuta a prospettare un migliore futuro per la torre. Di seguito i dettagli:

Al raggiungimento di € 40,000 - Messa in sicurezza e restauro delle porzioni maggiormente degradate di una facciata; 
Al raggiungimento di € 60,000 - Messa in sicurezza e restauro delle porzioni maggiormente degradate di due facciate; 
Al raggiungimento di € 90,000 - Messa in sicurezza e restauro delle porzioni maggiormente degradate di tre facciate; 
Al raggiungimento di € 120,000 - Messa in sicurezza e restauro delle porzioni maggiormente degradate di quattro facciate; 
Al raggiungimento di € 150,000 - Messa in sicurezza e restauro delle porzioni maggiormente degradate di quattro facciate e Messa in sicurezza e consolidamento del coronamento degli archetti in cotto.

Ogni goal raggiunto, è un futuro migliore per la Torre!

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>If you own a cat, then you already know the wonders and the joys that these creatures can bring into any home. If you do not own a cat, then it is imperative of you to learn about these wonders and joys. Homeless cats deserve a better life too. At the moment, however, there is a serious dearth of information when it comes to pet ownership and how you can actually help homeless cats.</p>
<p>Right now, we are turning to you, Indiegogo, in order to raise $12,000. These funds are going to cover the costs of developing, launching, and marketing ChapyCat.com. As a thank-you to everyone who contributes to our campaign, we have put together some outstanding rewards you can see on the right (Perks).</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact</h3>
<p>In addition to the widespread, positive impact that ChapyCat.com itself is sure to make, we intend to donate $500 of the first $12,000 that we raise here to shelters and nonprofit organizations. This, of course, is just the beginning. Once ChapyCat.com is ready it will immediately make a huge impact in people's lives making them understand that you don't have to be rich to help those in need. All it takes is love and the right knowledge they can find at ChapyCat.com and we will do our best to help homeless cats together.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What happens if goal is not reached?</h3>
<p>In case we do not make it and are unable to proceed with the website, all funds will be donated to help homeless cats in Greece. We know we can do a lot more to help cats in need if we manage to reach our goal. But in the worst scenario, all funds will go to shelters and nonprofit organizations which will be carefully chosen by us to ensure that every penny helps cats in need!</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Chapy</h3>
<p>Mom and dad <strong>never had a pet before</strong>. They couldn't see a reason why to adopt one. Until they got me. Now they love every single cat, dog, human and all living beings on Earth. I am <strong>Chapy</strong>! I am a 2 years old Japanese Bobtail cat and all I want is to make all animals and humans on Earth <strong>happy</strong>. That is why they call me Chapy! I am a happy Chapy!</p>

<p>This is the Chapy family. Me with mom and dad, Katia and Endri! Mom is a teacher and dad is a travel blogger. We live in Athens, Greece. That's why I travel a lot! Love them both very much and I am a very happy Chapy for my Chapy family! But let's listen what they have to say:</p>
<p><strong>Katia &amp; Endri:</strong> We never had a pet before. We used to think of the huge responsibility without thinking of the bright side. Until we took the final decision. We adopted Chapy about 2 years ago. He was 4 months old. The happiest years of our lives and all thanks to this little naughty bobtail cat. Yes, he is a bit naughty but in a good way. His personality is unique. From the very first day he made us happy. That's why we called him Chapy, because he is a happy Chapy. He made us so happy that we couldn't hide it and we wanted to tell everybody. We wanted to share and spread this (C)happiness. Everyone deserves to be happy and smile more and usually we find happiness where we least expect it. We found it on this little wonderful create. We never thought that a little cat would actually show us what real happiness is.</p>
<p>Then we decided to create a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/iChapy/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook page</a> and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/chapy_cat/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Instagram account</a> for Chapy. <a href=""https://twitter.com/Chapy_cat"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI5wSncjn44V9ZirMB0lU8g"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">YouTube</a> as well. We had to spread (C)happiness. We ought it to the world. We started with a few photos and videos of Chapy. The response was enormous. We couldn't believe it. The thing with Chapy is that he doesn't have to do anything special to make you love him and make you smile more. You fall in love with him at first sight, even if you see a photo of him while you are miles away and have never seen him in person or touch him. His fur is ultra soft, silky fur!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482402864/lvweqsqgfkwuqeahl3gg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Then we created his website <a href=""http://chapycat.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">chapycat.com</a>. The initial idea was to have a place where everyone could be happy simply by watching Chapy, his photos and videos, his how-to videos and useful information about cats. The website used to work well but then started having many issues and we had to close it. We have decided to rebuilt the website and make it 100 times better than it was with tons of new content and extra features. Our goal is to spread happiness and make everyone smile more. Thanks to Chapy we love all animals and humans on Earth. That's why we want to focus on encouraging adoption and help stray cats in Greece and all over the world. We have many stray cats in Greece and most of them starve to death or get hit by a car. We feed stray cats every day. We just wish we could do more. We wish we could afford to adopt them all. We are not sure how Chapy would feel about that though!</p>
<p>Chapy had health issues when we adopted him. Well, 4 days after we adopted him, he was diagnosed with fungus. Fungus is not very rare in cats, almost 50% of cats have it but only a few have the symptoms and can infect other animals and humans too. Yes, trying to cure Chapy we both got infected with fungus. We started a family treatment immediately with syrup, pills, skin treatment and a few injections. The bad thing with fungus is that it is very hard to get rid of it and the treatment lasted more than a month. The worse thing is that Chapy had to wear a cone? Yeap, the well known cone of shame. He really hated that cone and that is so obvious in the next photo. He couldn't even walk straight or use the sand box.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482402549/hbcckx5hlfw8tbggrtgl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our hearts were broken but we never gave up. We did our best to get rid of fungus as soon as possible. With positive energy and love we made it. Both of us and Chapy have been healthy since. If you are happy, you are healthy. Thank you Chapy!</p>

Risks & Challenges

There is nothing that can possibly go wrong with this project. Once the goal is reached we will start working on the new website to have it finished as soon as possible. As I said before if the goal is not reached and are unable to proceed with the website all the mney will be donated to help stray cats.

The Chapy Family

This is the Chapy family. Me with mom and dad, Katia and Endri! Mom is a teacher and dad is a travel blogger. We live in Athens, Greece. That's why I travel a lot! Love them both very much and I am a very happy Chapy for my Chapy family! But let's listen what they have to say:
Katia & Endri: We never had a pet before. We used to think of the huge responsibility without thinking of the bright side. Until we took the final decision. We adopted Chapy about 2 years ago. He was 4 months old. The happiest years of our lives and all thanks to this little naughty bobtail cat. Yes, he is a bit naughty but in a good way. His personality is unique. From the very first day he made us happy. That's why we called him Chapy, because he is a happy Chapy. He made us so happy that we couldn't hide it and we wanted to tell everybody. We wanted to share and spread this (C)happiness. Everyone deserves to be happy and smile more and usually we find happiness where we least expect it. We found it on this little wonderful create. We never thought that a little cat would actually show us what real happiness is.
Then we decided to create a Facebook page and Instagram account for Chapy. Twitter and YouTube as well. We had to spread (C)happiness. We ought it to the world. We started with a few photos and videos of Chapy. The response was enormous. We couldn't believe it. The thing with Chapy is that he doesn't have to do anything special to make you love him and make you smile more. You fall in love with him at first sight, even if you see a photo of him while you are miles away and have never seen him in person or touch him. His fur is ultra soft, silky fur!

Then we created his website chapycat.com. The initial idea was to have a place where everyone could be happy simply by watching Chapy, his photos and videos, his how-to videos and useful information about cats. The website used to work well but then started having many issues and we had to close it. We have decided to rebuilt the website and make it 100 times better than it was with tons of new content and extra features. Our goal is to spread happiness and make everyone smile more. Thanks to Chapy we love all animals and humans on Earth. That's why we want to focus on encouraging adoption and help stray cats in Greece and all over the world. We have many stray cats in Greece and most of them starve to death or get hit by a car. We feed stray cats every day. We just wish we could do more. We wish we could afford to adopt them all. We are not sure how Chapy would feel about that though!
Chapy had health issues when we adopted him. Well, 4 days after we adopted him, he was diagnosed with fungus. Fungus is not very rare in cats, almost 50% of cats have it but only a few have the symptoms and can infect other animals and humans too. Yes, trying to cure Chapy we both got infected with fungus. We started a family treatment immediately with syrup, pills, skin treatment and a few injections. The bad thing with fungus is that it is very hard to get rid of it and the treatment lasted more than a month. The worse thing is that Chapy had to wear a cone? Yeap, the well known cone of shame. He really hated that cone and that is so obvious in the next photo. He couldn't even walk straight or use the sand box.

Our hearts were broken but we never gave up. We did our best to get rid of fungus as soon as possible. With positive energy and love we made it. Both of us and Chapy have been healthy since. If you are happy, you are healthy. Thank you Chapy!",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What Matters Most</h3>
<p>Farming is the largest human endeavor on earth and by 2050 we will need to feed over 2.5 BILLION more people. Which means we will have to DOUBLE our current crop production. While water scarcity, limited land availability and increasing power costs impact crop production.</p>
<p>Currently there are 795 MILLION people in a constant state of malnutrition around the world. This is often caused by limited water availability, poor growing conditions and non cost effective power. Our ability to site our off-grid greenhouses any time, any where can have a dramatic impact on world wide health. </p>
<p>Meanwhile 45% of Fruits and Vegetables are lost or wasted. We can reduce that waste to 10% by providing a controlled growing and processing environment in our Off-Grid Solar Greenhouses. Siting them near major metropolitan areas; delivering locally grown, organic produce and creating local jobs. </p>
<h3>Teaming for Success</h3>
<p>PowerGrow is made up of a team of Energy, Construction and Greenhouse experts, with over 120 years of combined experience. Our advisory board includes three of the leading greenhouse experts in the country, helping to ensure our success. </p>
<p>We have a patented process to integrate solar single-axis tracking systems and integrated battery storage that give growers a sustainable growing environment and the ability to provide locally grown, organic produce anywhere in the world. Being off-grid allows us to build facilities far faster and more economically than ever before. </p>
<p>Your contribution to our cause will help us complete the first two pilot sites that are already under development. On average each commercial grow operation will save over 13,000,000 gallons of water every year, compared to an outdoor grow operation. While at the same time conserving natural resources, preserving habitats, reducing waste and improving food quality.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are raising $500,000. $400,000 will go directly to completing the first three commercial projects in Utah, Hawaii and Arizona. $100,000 will be spent on general operating expenses and submitting additional patents for our thermal energy storage applications in the greenhouses. </li>
<li>Your contributions will go directly to developing the first three sites. You will also receive   fresh, organic produce from our Partner FarmBox Direct on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis; depending on your contribution. </li>
<li>If we don't reach the entire goal, we will still use whatever funds are raised to complete in order: the 2 Acre Utah Project, 1 Acre Hawaii Project and the 15 Acre Arizona Project.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know the difference their contribution will make:​</p>
<p><strong>Climate Change:</strong> Because the greenhouses are completely powered with solar power and battery energy storage, we have created growing environment that uses no fossil fuels. In addition, because you can grow 800% more produce per acre in our greenhouses, we can directly impact the need to further impact rain forests and natural habitats. On average, our greenhouses will generate enough clean energy to eliminate over 15,000 barrels of oil being burned or save 46 acres of forest from deforestation. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477606387/kbjgc5hsm6hakw5ervkd.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Water Savings:</strong> Each standard 15 acre facility will save over 13,000,000 gallons of water every year. That is enough water saved for over 1,400 people annualy. Water scarcity and water quality issues are going going to increase. We can't solve this completely, but we can make a dramatic difference in the world. </p>
<p><strong>​</strong><strong>Hunger:</strong> Our ability to site our greenhouse operations anywhere in the world provides an immediate opportunity to help solve world hunger and improve people's health. We are already in discussions with island nations such as the Bahamas and Virgin Islands, where growing is difficult due to water scarcity, soil conditions, and unreliable power sources. </p>
<p><strong>Waste:</strong> With over 45% of all fruits and vegetables, there is tremendous opportunity to reduce the percentage of produce that is lost or wasted across the supply chain. PowerGrow can directly impact over 30% of that waste through controlled growing environments and quickly delivering locally grown produces that lasts longer and tastes better. </p>
<h3>Our Team &amp; Partners</h3>
<p><strong>Our Team</strong> has experience developing over 200 MW of solar projects, numerous complex commercial building energy projects and developing some of the most advanced greenhouse operations in the world. </p>
<p><strong>Our Partners</strong> include growers, wholesalers and equipment manufacturers. We are in active discussions with many of the top 100 growers in the country. In fact, we already Letters of Intent from growers for over 400 acres of greenhouses. We are in the process of creating vertical integration strategies for our grower, wholesaler and distribution partners to reduce the cost of produce and speed time to market. Over the past year we have established partnerships with Philips Lighting, MetLife, tenK Solar and several other manufacturing partners to extract cost out of the construction process and help us scale the business. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are risks and challenges that every business faces over time. PowerGrow has worked diligently to identify and mitigate all potential risks and address the challenges all new businesses face. Below is a snapshot of our identified risks and what we have done to solve them. </p>
<p><strong>Competition Risk:</strong>  While some greenhouse manufacturers may be viewed as competitors, we are in active discussions with many of them exploring partnership opportunities. Because our solar tracking system is patented we have created barriers of entry for similar solutions. This intellectual property protection will insulate us from some level of competition for the immediate future. </p>
<p><strong>Execution Risk:</strong> To ensure the success of our sites, we are working directly with leaders within the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), University of Arizona Department of Agriculture and Biosystem and the Colorado State University Horticulture Department. These partners help ensure we leverage best practices and apply the lessons they have learned over the past 30 years, with respect to greenhouse growing processes. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477607388/xndp1bdx6zmxx58e57vc.png"" src="""" style=""""/>     <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477607697/xtkehyjswbws75v0zi2w.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Financial Risk:</strong>  Because of the our ability to integrate solar energy into the greenhouse structure itself, the projects qualify for a USDA loan guarantee program. This greatly reduces the financial risk to lenders and investors in our business. Since we are effectively delivering these greenhouses as a service to growers, it is important that we only partner with credit-worthy growers who have solid balance sheets and growing experience. In addition, we place a certain amount of capital in reserve accounts to ensure each project can overcome any financial issues that arise over time. </p>
<p>               <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477608103/otbhdmby8notfjcpanau.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Market Risk:</strong>  Produce prices change over time. This risk is borne by our Grower partners and not by PowerGrow. The risk of crop failure or lower crop demands is mitigated greatly by the greenhouse facilities themselves. We can dramatically limit precipitation, soil and temperature issues. Pests are also more easily controlled and eliminated in controlled greenhouse growing environments. Our Grower partners can more easily adapt our greenhouse facilities for different crops based on market demand and price. This helps ensure both their success and ours. </p>

A story about how thousands of people with different agendas came together and worked together for a better outdoors.Jesse has been a film producer for over 180 film productions including one very successful feature documentary film. He has been helping businesses, organizations, and people tell their stories successfully through film and media for over 10 years. You can visit his portfolio at www.JesseHieb.com.Telling this story in a unique way is the perfect way to raise awareness about a world wide issue. Togther we can work together to revive our fresh water resources and support the incredible outdoors. We can change communities and we can save lives just by preserving our fresh water resources.Risks & ChallengesSome of the obstacles we face with completing this film are time and money. Creating a world class film is not cheap and it requires thousands of hours of work. I know this because it is what I do. I manage and produce films of all different types and it is hard work. The ones that people pay attention to are the ones that were given the most time and the most resources to complete. My plan is to first use my organizing and management skills to develope a team of industry professionals who also have a passion for the outdoors to help me tell this story and complete the post production. I will also spend hundreds hours of my own time to go through and process as much of the initial footage. This will save on professional editing hours. I will also be working with a number of friends in the music industry to compose a sound track that will be moving and professional.Other Ways You Can HelpI completely understand that you may not be able to help financially.

<h2>Food Heroes</h2>
<p>Food systems and human consumption of food are fundamental to advancing the sustainable development of our world and enhancing the livelihood of our communities.</p>
<p>To motivate kids to change diets, we must go beyond this knowledge to emotions. These Food Heroes need to be compellingly designed with the various talents of master storytellers. The Food Heroes curriculum was collaboratively created with world-class experts around the world across multiple disciplines- sustainability, nutrition, medicine, chefs, teachers, gamification experts, regenerative farmers, policy influencers.</p>
<p>Now, we need help to productize and produce the curriculum into a user-friendly format for teachers, educators, and parents. This campaign will fund graphic designers, product designers, teacher testers and a first round of printing of the Food Heroes program.</p>
<p>Food Heroes starts in China, but has quickly gained traction around the world. Our program is in demand in several countries, and we hope to meet this global demand as soon as we can.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Today's industrial diets has largely been responsible for our personal, planetary, economic, societal and spiritual challenges. Food education is the single intervention that can help achieve all the 17 Global Goals. Yet most countries lack food education.</p>
<p>The skyrocketing demand for meat and dairy has begun to strain the environment, causing an increase in greenhouse gas emissions and deforestation. Three food groups alone: soy, palm, and cattle, are responsible for 80% of global deforestation, and in China a 35% jump in meat consumption from 1994-2005 resulted in the emission of 230 million more tons of CO2. Processed food and its packaging creates trash which overwhelms oceans, rivers, landfills.  Non-local food distribution, uses 4-17 times more fuel and emits 5-17 times more carbon dioxide than local food distribution. Food waste is another massive drain of crops and energy. One-third of the world’s food production is wasted, accounting for 4.4 gigatons of CO2 emissions annually. Our food systems are hurting people's health and hurting the ecosystems.</p>
<p>By mastering JUCCCE's Food Heroes game, kids become ""Food Heroes."" Food Heroes change the way their communities eat and what foods they buy. By changing the foods kids want their parents to buy for them, the demand for healthy foods shifts the food supply chain towards a more resilient and regenerative agriculture. By changing the way kids share food with others, societies heal in the way they mindfully eat with each other and are grateful for the communities that worked hard to bring the food to their tables. Food Heroes is a food education program and story-driven game with touchpoints in the classroom, at home and online. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Funding and donations will enable JUCCCE to produce and distribute Food Heroes' education packs, a year long curriculum for kindergarten, to schools and teachers at a very low cost. Donations will directly go to the following specific projects and project items:</p>
<p>1) Graphic Design of the education packs- we want Food Heroes to pop and for kids to love them!</p>
<p>2) Translation- professional translation and translation edits for Chinese, Maori, Bahasa, Spanish and other top languages around the world. </p>
<p>3) Teacher Training- we need to get teachers onboard and excited about Food Heroes. Donations will fund in person training events, teacher recruitment, and the development of an online training course.</p>
<p>4) Additional Product Design- we hope to surround children at school and at  home with the Food Heroes message and lessons. Developing more products, games, and toys, like flashcards, placemats, and table cloths, will help us to reach into the home and educate more families</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Many rural smallholder farmers in Africa face soil degradation and reducing crop yields. Safi Organics, in collaboration with Takachar, produces a locally made fertilizer blend from new chemical process developed at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Our fertilizer---Safi Sarvi---improves farmers' yields by up to 100% at the same price they pay for agricultural inputs by restoring their soil fertility. At the same time, our carbon-rich, biochar-based fertilizer sequesters inert carbon into the soil. Therefore, we promote regenerative and carbon-negative agriculture while enhancing the livelihood of the poorest farmers.</p>
<p>We have already set up a production facility in Kenya and proven the technology and product.  Currently we are serving 2,500 farmers. Recently we received an exciting offer by the Nakuru County Government to expand our services to farmers in its county fertilizer subsidy program. This contract is for payment on delivery, and as part of this campaign, we are seeking an increase in our working capital in order to deliver on an order of this magnitude. Furthermore, in order to fulfill our expanded production sustainably in the future, part of the funds from this campaign will also be used to implement MIT/Takachar's newest production prototype in our existing operation.</p>
<p><strong>If you have not already checked out our video above, please see it here: [<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0HUk-dpftg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0HUk-dpftg</a>].</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>Rural farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa often pay 2-3 times the world price for their fertilizers, due to the fact that most fertilizers today are produced in large-scale, centralized, and capital-intensive facilities, and then shipped via long-distance transport to rural areas. Due to the farmers limited income, they can often only afford the cheapest, synthetic varieties that over the long term may actually acidify and degrade their soil due to over-dependence. As a result, some farmers have seen their post-harvest yields decrease by up to 50% in the last 20 years. This is a significant concern for local food security.</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>We use a combination of technology (developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and proprietary recipes to decentralize and downsize fertilizer production, such that it can be carried out profitably on a village-level scale using locally available resources and labor. Imagine small-scale, low-cost, mobile systems that can be latched onto the back of tractors or donkey carts, and be moved from farm to farm to enable localized conversion of agricultural residues into a fertilizer base under 2 hours without needing external energy input. This base is then mixed with our proprietary recipes to complete the nutrient as standalone fertilizer application. Our process drastically reduces the long-distance logistics needed to deliver high-quality fertilizers to farmers by producing the bulk locally. Our branded and carbon-negative product, Safi Sarvi, improves farmers’ harvest yield and income by up to 30% for the same cost that they pay for fertilizer inputs. The technology as well as the product have been proven, in the course of the past 8 years, both in the lab and in the field (data available upon request).</p>
<h3>Achievements to Date</h3>
<p>We have our first production facility in Mwea, Kenya, from which we currently serve 2,500 farmers. Our product has been officially certified by the Government of Kenya as a standalone fertilizer as of 2018. As of 2019, our production has reached the financial breakeven point. We are winners of prizes such as the MIT Agribusiness Prize, MIT IDEAS Global Challenge Competition, the University of California Berkeley Big Ideas Prize, and the Total Startupper of the Year.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Ask</h3>
<p>Recently, we received our first government tender: the Nakuru County Government wants us to supply US$58,000 worth of fertilizers to 1,000 farmers in a ward in Nakuru County. This is a huge progress for us in achieving scale and impact.</p>
<p>However, there is a catch: In Kenya, the normal standard of government orders is for payment to follow verified and documented product delivery. To finance production to meet the order, we need an increase in our current working capital. To increase our production capacity to fulfill anticipated future orders like this, we will also be implementing the newest production technique from MIT/Takachar. These activities require a total of US$25,000.</p>
<p>The funds we raise through this campaign will reside with us as an evergreen working capital, and will allow us to grow and fulfill other tenders and large orders in the future. Once the funds have been received from this contract they will be reinvested in the business to expand and hence create more impact.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Meet Mr. Kibuchi, who holds a one-hectare rice farm. Over the past 15 years, he had seen his yield reduced by about half due to soil degradation. After using our product, his input costs remained consistent, but he has seen his crop yield increased by 30%, and income increased by 50%. This was sufficient to send his two children to school, and last year, for him to afford a second-hand tractor for his farm. Amongst the 2,500 farmers that we work with, these economic gains are widely reported, even after one season of using our product. For them, our fertilizer not only restores their soil health, but also leads to better economic outcomes.</p>
<p>Additionally, our work creates additional rural job and income opportunities, such that youths no longer need to migrate to cities to find jobs. Meet Japhet: he is from the local village, and joined our pilot production as a worker. After 3 years, he has been promoted to production foreman, and is considering getting an MBA degree in Nairobi to further his career.</p>
<p>Moreover, because our fertilizer is rich in inert carbon, when one ton of it is applied to the soil, it also effectively sequesters 1.5 tons of CO2 equivalent from the atmosphere for hundreds of years. Thus, the more we supply, the more carbon we also sequester.</p>
<p>Specifically, your contribution will help us fulfill our delivery to an additional 1,000 farmers in the Nakuru County through the government tender. Make your pledge today and help a new rural community in Karura Ward rise out of poverty.</p>

<p></p>
<ul>
<li>I am Yash Qaraah- Short Film maker</li>
<li>My campaign is very important because of the lies we've been given</li>
<li>throughout history. The Lord never judge us on Race. The LORD has</li>
<li>always judge us on Laws Statutes and Commandments. </li>
<li>Men in power has decided to separate the Lords people, from uniting. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>We need to come together as Righteous Men Women and Children.</b></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>Here is the Plan truth on this campaign:</p>
<ul>
<li>100% of the funding go's on this Project. Under Qaraah Films-LLC</li>
<li>We will also build on location within USA-Colorado Springs<br/>
</li>
<li>If we don't get all of the funding but, receive some we will still do our</li>
<li>best in building our community on a shoe string budget.</li>
<li>in Colorado Springs Co.</li>
</ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
</div><p>Your contributions are a movement that proves that you are of the Righteous and have a need to see change. By helping with funding and building communities. <br/></p><ul>
<li>There are a lot of movies that come out year after year, however none speak about the true segregation of ethnicity's.</li>
<li>I've been very successful on Independent Projects like 7stage.com also my YouTube channels, as well as my Spreakers Radio streaming station.</li>
<li>A lot of people have ideas, but how many have started a movement of Righteousness ? I have and it's World Wide!</li>
</ul><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>When creating communities and building on location keep in mind, the cost of the labor and land of permits and zoning. As well as a families crew's for hire.</p>
<ul>
<li>Please be advised I'm already putting my funds where my mouth is with my own independent movement on 7stage.com,Spreaker Radio,You Tube etc..</li>
<li>I have a mission to complete and there has always been the nay Sayers there will always be the bench warmers and the go getters. We can't wait on government to assist our love for humanity. We all have a gift of some sort, nevertheless contributing as righteous people will make a world of difference's.<br/>

I am Yash Qaraah- Short Film maker
My campaign is very important because of the lies we've been given
throughout history. The Lord never judge us on Race. The LORD has
always judge us on Laws Statutes and Commandments. 
Men in power has decided to separate the Lords people, from uniting. 

We need to come together as Righteous Men Women and Children.
   What We Need & What You Get 
Here is the Plan truth on this campaign:

100% of the funding go's on this Project. Under Qaraah Films-LLC
We will also build on location within USA-Colorado Springs

If we don't get all of the funding but, receive some we will still do our
best in building our community on a shoe string budget.
in Colorado Springs Co.

  The Impact 
Your contributions are a movement that proves that you are of the Righteous and have a need to see change. By helping with funding and building communities. 
There are a lot of movies that come out year after year, however none speak about the true segregation of ethnicity's.
I've been very successful on Independent Projects like 7stage.com also my YouTube channels, as well as my Spreakers Radio streaming station.
A lot of people have ideas, but how many have started a movement of Righteousness ? I have and it's World Wide!

Risks & Challenges  
When creating communities and building on location keep in mind, the cost of the labor and land of permits and zoning. As well as a families crew's for hire.

Please be advised I'm already putting my funds where my mouth is with my own independent movement on 7stage.com,Spreaker Radio,You Tube etc..
I have a mission to complete and there has always been the nay Sayers there will always be the bench warmers and the go getters. We can't wait on government to assist our love for humanity. We all have a gift of some sort, nevertheless contributing as righteous people will make a world of difference's.

<p>
The Jenner Visitor Center (JVC) is an essential piece
of the region’s history and continues to be an important site that provides
visitors with access to the area’s marine ecology. During the late 1940’s, the
structure was the Jenner Boathouse where handmade boats were constructed. The
building was located on a wharf that served as a launching point for small
boats. Now, the Jenner Visitor Center is a hub for welcoming visitors and
educating them about the magnificent coastal region and its adjacent natural
wonders, while providing spectacular views of the Russian River and estuary.</p>
<p>
The JVC introduces over 14,000 visitors a year to
the Sonoma Coast with its series of beaches separated by rock bluffs and
headlands. From the deck of the JVC where the Russian River meets the Pacific Ocean, visitors can see harbor seals, river otters,
osprey fishing and bald eagles. The estuary where the Center sits is an
important area for restoration studies and habitat preservation. The JVC is a
small gem along 17 miles of coastline along which visitors can enjoy more than
19 miles of hiking trails, whale and seal watching and viewing of nesting
seabirds. The JVC serves as the gateway to State and Regional park campgrounds
and recreational activities including boating, surfing, paddle boarding, wind
sailing, kayaking and canoeing.  </p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FaqbUbOZ6m4U%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DaqbUbOZ6m4U&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FaqbUbOZ6m4U%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>

during a trip, and foster a connection with nature.  </p>
<h3><b>The Work Ahead of Us</b></h3>
<p>
With

stepping up to secure funding for and complete this project. We are not simply repairing
an old structure; we are working to save the life of a thriving center that provides
educational information about the region and services to more than 14,000
visitors a year. While a range of building improvements are needed over the
next 3 to 5 years, <b>our immediate

Soil science is particularity unique in that it integrates STEM topics such as physics, chemistry, entomology, microbiology &amp; geology, which can all be difficult to teach in the classroom, especially if hands-on activities are limited. However, if youth are introduced with  appropriate modalities, such as animation and music, soil science serves as a well rounded platform to enhance Science Technology Engineering &amp; Mathematics goals. Our song combined with vivid and scientifically relevant animation will support teachers seeking outside resources. </p><p>This is a not-for-profit initiative aimed at creating a short video that provides a one-of-a-kind teaching tool to STEM educators, at no cost to them. We need your help to bring it to reality.</p><p>Our animators Tynesha Foreman and Joe Paquette are excited to move forward with animating this song, but they need fair compensation for their time.

this Song Came to Be</h2>
<h2>(<a href=""https://soundcloud.com/thesoilisalive"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Click
here to listen</a>)</h2><h2></h2><p>The Soil is Alive is a song written by University of Maryland Alumni,  Spencer and Max Ernst, and Tony Dimeglio, as part of a fun introduction to soils for middle schools enrolled in a 4-H program called Adventures in Science. </p><p>The song was an afterthought inspired by the Ernst brothers as a way to turn a standard PowerPoint presentation on soil formation factors into something the students could actually get into--and they did!  The voices you hear in the song are the students, and with the help of numerous sustained hours in the studio Spencer and Max were able to professionally remaster the classroom recording into a catchy song with modern beats.    <br/></p><p>When we brought the song to life, we had no idea it would retain such educational value. We shared it with several middle and high school teachers and they unanimously agreed that it needs animation to become a teacher-friendly classroom tool.  </p><h2><span style=""font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;line-height: 24px;background-color: initial;"">Our rough storyboard inspired by the song:</span></h2><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FjgPtT4X3KDA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DjgPtT4X3KDA%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FjgPtT4X3KDA%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p><h2><b>Why are we so excited to animate the song?</b></h2><div>

</div></div>","The Soil is Alive with YOUR support!We wrote a song in partnership with 4-H to excite youth about soil science! Soil science is particularity unique in that it integrates STEM topics such as physics, chemistry, entomology, microbiology & geology, which can all be difficult to teach in the classroom, especially if hands-on activities are limited. However, if youth are introduced with  appropriate modalities, such as animation and music, soil science serves as a well rounded platform to enhance Science Technology Engineering & Mathematics goals. Our song combined with vivid and scientifically relevant animation will support teachers seeking outside resources. This is a not-for-profit initiative aimed at creating a short video that provides a one-of-a-kind teaching tool to STEM educators, at no cost to them. We need your help to bring it to reality.Our animators Tynesha Foreman and Joe Paquette are excited to move forward with animating this song, but they need fair compensation for their time. Your contributions bring this song to life. How
this Song Came to Be
(Click
here to listen)The Soil is Alive is a song written by University of Maryland Alumni,  Spencer and Max Ernst, and Tony Dimeglio, as part of a fun introduction to soils for middle schools enrolled in a 4-H program called Adventures in Science. The song was an afterthought inspired by the Ernst brothers as a way to turn a standard PowerPoint presentation on soil formation factors into something the students could actually get into--and they did!  The voices you hear in the song are the students, and with the help of numerous sustained hours in the studio Spencer and Max were able to professionally remaster the classroom recording into a catchy song with modern beats.    When we brought the song to life, we had no idea it would retain such educational value. We shared it with several middle and high school teachers and they unanimously agreed that it needs animation to become a teacher-friendly classroom tool.  Our rough storyboard inspired by the song:Why are we so excited to animate the song?
Scientists are still scratching their heads about life in soils. There is so much that needs further explore to fully understand soils role in supporting food systems, life for important ecological niches, sustaining healthy air quality and climate cycles, & reducing hazardous waste. For young minds to dream a curiosity for soil science, we have to spark their imagination--and what a better way than with an animated video. Whether their curiosity for soils leads an award winning STEM fair project, helping out at a local garden, or getting into college, this animated sing-along will propagate that first step into inquiry,
Legendary soil chemists, Dr. Bruce James, sees value in animating this song. 

The Team:

We are diverse in life
experiences, education and upbringing. This diversity builds a team that works
cohesively to bring this song to life. 
Music and Melody
Tony Dimeglio - Environmental Science - University of MD 2013
 & Virginia Tech Entomology Graduate Student (M.S. Candidate
2016)
The soil enthusiast
who had the idea to use music in the classroom to excite youth about soils
Animation
Our animators Tynesha Foreman
and Joe Paquette are working so well together already and cannot wait to animate this song. 
Tynesha has a knack
for character development, stop-motion and mixed media. She'll bring life into
the animation. Joe is talented with digital media, overlaying natural textures
and adding lighting effects. He is key for creating the setting for Tynesha's
characters. 
Check out some of
their work below:

Joe Paquette - George Mason University

Here are two original works from each animator to illustrate the overall vibe to their synergistic talents:

Gaia s.r.l.  was founded in Bologna, Italy, to create innovatory projects that will preserve our environment.
Modular Eolic Centrifuge is our first internationally visible project. After 5 years of hard work we are attracting global attention with an international patent released in March 2015.
            
This project has incredible potential and aims to become an alternative to current green technologies, reducing costs significantly and increasing productivity as well as expanding the possible areas where it can be installed.
Interest in this project is considerable. Proof of this is that many Italian and foreign investors have already shown their interest by making their offer.
So far we have declined all offers because we want to succeed by ourselves, with you, with crowdfunding.
This would help us keep management control over the project and give the founders and inventors of this patent major quotas.Our main goal is do something good for the planet! In order to do that, we need  you all!

If we succeed, we'll be able to focus on preserving the planet and its inhabitants rather than on profit.

M.E.C. can be a long term solution to climate change and to expensive, polluting and non renewable fossil fuels.

Our goal is also that of helping poor areas of the planet with our technology, bringing electric power where economic interest is low. If we were to fail with crowdfunding and had to resort to private investors this intention might be lost.
The epic win is settled on 1 million euro. This would allow the company to start the project and be autonomous and active even after industrial production and engineering.

I Worked for 20 years as a Commercial Manager for multinational company with the sole purpose of making profit. But since I became the father of a beautiful little girl (now 6 years old) maybe something has changed in my head and I've changed.  I wanted to improve the quality of people's lives and increase respect for the environment. So being a (moderate) smoker I tried to find a solution for the <b>10 BILLION cigarette butts littering in the environment every day. In fact </b><b>in addition to the risk of fire (newest example 02/21/2015 Torch Tower in Dubai)</b><b>, I well understand the serious environmental damage caused by these cigarette butts, declared by many International scientific research to be highly polluting, toxic and carcinogenic. Important </b><b>enough to be considered ""the  main urban waste in the world ""!!!</b><p>After several studies, tests and research results, I designed the first portable multifunction pocket, that would make it easier to avoid having to throw the butts into the environment. <b>It  is named SMOOKEY with the functions of Lighting / Putting Out cigarettes (in 5"") and hermetically containing butts ( Maximum 6 )  in complete safety, until the smoker finds a suitable place to dispose of them !</b></p>
<p>Pending disposal of cigarette butts, Smookey can then be kept inside the pockets of pants and jackets or bags lady, safely and total absence of unpleasant smells !!!</p>
<p>Because the solution of the big problem is to make it simple and fast for every smoker to manage their toxic waste (butts), in any place and moment but ""immediately"" and safely when they want to or have to putt out their cigarettes !!!  </p>
<p>Indeed, certainly the solution to the problem, is not to install an ""endless number of special containers in all public places"" (with obvious huge installation costs, operators for recovery and disposal, etc...), but rather using the existing bins and containers combined with the use of SMOOKEY or other accessories pocket !!!</p>
<p><b>This image below could be the result  of the environment with or without SMOOKEY.</b></p>

<div>If you are a civil and polite smoker or even a non smoker but tired of seeing this mess everywhere in the environment, ""with total and absolute indifference of those directly and primarily responsible for the problem that are the Producers and Distributors of cigarettes and in the same way almost all National and International Institutions around the world, we kindly ask you :<p>- Help us with a small contribution to achieve the necessary funds for the realization of a mold injection plastics to 6/8 figures, in order to optimize and reduce the current  cost of production,  to make ""SMOOKEY"" really cheap and accessible to all and make this simple and possible innovation public knowledge !!!!!</p>
<p> - If you can not in any way contribute to this project of social benefit and protection of the environment around us, thanks anyway if you help us to spread to the world the existence of ""SMOOKEY"" and then make it public knowledge, as a possible solution to the serious problem universally shared, in order to improve the environment for all of us and in particular for our children !!!</p>

<h2>Risks and challenges :</h2>The risks are in eve thing we do, but we have worked hard to avoid them.<p>Here are some of the key areas we've covered :</p>
<p>DESIGN :  The design has been conceived in order to obtain a product ""all in one"" easy to use, pocket-size and multi function, minimizing the costs of production.</p>
<p>PRODUCTION :  The production is conducted by a local manufacturer with proven experience. This means that we are in place for checks on production and quality control. We have worked hard to optimize our project with of course my 2 Partners Santo and Salvatore, the Designer Nicola and toolmaker Drusiani, before production.  *In any case, with obtaining the necessary funds, it will be possible the realization of a new mold to multiple figures with further improvements technical-functional and strong reduction in the current cost of production.</p>
<p>SUPPLY CHAIN :  Smookey is designed to remove complexity and optimize the production process.  As a result we haven't need assembly, multiple suppliers, offshore manufacture, etc....</p>DISTRIBUTION :  Often the best ideas/products/projects fall precisely because of the difficulty of distribution. The current difficult global economic situation makes it even more difficult initiatives to promote and push radically innovative products and therefore ""not known and obviously not distributed"". In response to this big problem then,  if  SMOOKEY is somehow known,  understood and like getting, it can be sold as  slight  (only 24gr.) and small (only 8x5x1,5 cm), and sent in small quantities around the world, in a normal envelope, minimizing the cost of packing, shipping and distribution.<p></p>

</div></div>","Good day, my name is Pierpaolo Cortesi, I am 46 years old and Italian. I Worked for 20 years as a Commercial Manager for multinational company with the sole purpose of making profit. But since I became the father of a beautiful little girl (now 6 years old) maybe something has changed in my head and I've changed.  I wanted to improve the quality of people's lives and increase respect for the environment. So being a (moderate) smoker I tried to find a solution for the 10 BILLION cigarette butts littering in the environment every day. In fact in addition to the risk of fire (newest example 02/21/2015 Torch Tower in Dubai), I well understand the serious environmental damage caused by these cigarette butts, declared by many International scientific research to be highly polluting, toxic and carcinogenic. Important enough to be considered ""the  main urban waste in the world ""!!!After several studies, tests and research results, I designed the first portable multifunction pocket, that would make it easier to avoid having to throw the butts into the environment. It  is named SMOOKEY with the functions of Lighting / Putting Out cigarettes (in 5"") and hermetically containing butts ( Maximum 6 )  in complete safety, until the smoker finds a suitable place to dispose of them !
Pending disposal of cigarette butts, Smookey can then be kept inside the pockets of pants and jackets or bags lady, safely and total absence of unpleasant smells !!!
Because the solution of the big problem is to make it simple and fast for every smoker to manage their toxic waste (butts), in any place and moment but ""immediately"" and safely when they want to or have to putt out their cigarettes !!!  
Indeed, certainly the solution to the problem, is not to install an ""endless number of special containers in all public places"" (with obvious huge installation costs, operators for recovery and disposal, etc...), but rather using the existing bins and containers combined with the use of SMOOKEY or other accessories pocket !!!
This image below could be the result  of the environment with or without SMOOKEY.

If you are a civil and polite smoker or even a non smoker but tired of seeing this mess everywhere in the environment, ""with total and absolute indifference of those directly and primarily responsible for the problem that are the Producers and Distributors of cigarettes and in the same way almost all National and International Institutions around the world, we kindly ask you :- Help us with a small contribution to achieve the necessary funds for the realization of a mold injection plastics to 6/8 figures, in order to optimize and reduce the current  cost of production,  to make ""SMOOKEY"" really cheap and accessible to all and make this simple and possible innovation public knowledge !!!!!
 - If you can not in any way contribute to this project of social benefit and protection of the environment around us, thanks anyway if you help us to spread to the world the existence of ""SMOOKEY"" and then make it public knowledge, as a possible solution to the serious problem universally shared, in order to improve the environment for all of us and in particular for our children !!!

<p><i>""I have been
making environmental documentaries for more than 20 years. When I made Food for Thought in 1998, it was one of the first videos to tell
the story of the dangers of GMOs. Then, Raindancer Media, Global Justice
Ecology Project, Three Americas and Earth Links, in 2007 jointly produced A Silent Forest in which scientist David Suzuki passionately and eloquently warned us about GE trees. Now with GE trees in the ground for
testing and the pending release of many genetically engineered tree species for
fruit and fuel, we made Synthetic Forests to bring its cautionary tale
up to date.""</i>  <br/></p>

Our documentary provides an investigation into
the devastating effects GE trees could have on our health and the
environment.  With increasing public awareness and our work together we stop these trees before they are released.Please help us show Synthetic Forests Worldwide!It is critical to translate Synthetic Forests into Portuguese, Spanish,
Chinese and other languages, as well as mail DVDs internationally so our
message travels as far and fast as possible.
Your donations to our first
Indiegogo campaign made it possible for us to produce Synthetic
Forests and to now provide it free online. Please share it
widely with by emailing a link to the film with Facebook or other social media.




How your contributions will be used in our second campaign

Our  2007 video, A Silent Forest, was successfully distributed on DVDs in English, with Spanish and Chinese subtitles. And hundreds of thousands of people worldwide learned about genetically engineered trees while watching the film at online sites. Beginning with translations to Portuguese, Spanish and Chinese, funded with your help, millions of viewers will see GE trees for the disaster they are. Please consider supporting our film with a donation to help create translations and subtitles in Portuguese, Spanish and Chinese.
How
your contributions were used in our first campaign
We
completed many hours of research and traveled to shoot amazing interviews. Your tax-deductible donations were critical for filming, editing and post-production as well as graphics and a limited run of DVDs.  But there is much more to do…as you can see the difficult work of film making is completed thanks to your
donations. We now need your help to get the word out as fast and far as possible and
to translate Synthetic Forests so that people all over the world can understand the dangers that are
on lurking at their doorstep.  Together we can stop this worldwide threat to our
health and our environment.

From the
Director:
""I have been
making environmental documentaries for more than 20 years. When I made Food for Thought in 1998, it was one of the first videos to tell
the story of the dangers of GMOs. Then, Raindancer Media, Global Justice
Ecology Project, Three Americas and Earth Links, in 2007 jointly produced A Silent Forest in which scientist David Suzuki passionately and eloquently warned us about GE trees. Now with GE trees in the ground for
testing and the pending release of many genetically engineered tree species for
fruit and fuel, we made Synthetic Forests to bring its cautionary tale
up to date.""  
—Ed Schehl


""The
rush to apply these ideas is absolutely dangerous because we don't have a clue
what the long term impacts of our manipulations are going to be...""
— Dr. David
Suzuki, from our 2007 film, A Silent Forest -The Growing Threat of
Genetically Engineered Trees.

Synthetic Forests features interviews with leading
scientists and activists who share their insights and experience on the
negative effects genetically engineered trees can have to communities, ecosystems
and indigenous peoples.
Corporations
in the US and Brazil have requested
government authorization to release hundreds of millions of genetically engineered eucalyptus trees for fuel and pulp. We have recently learned that the GE Loblolly Pine and Arctic Apple have been approved by the
USDA, so the time to act is now!
GE Pollen can
drift hundreds of miles!
If communities do not learn about, organize and STOP the requested unrestricted release of 500 million GE
eucalyptus trees or the Loblolly Pine, inhaled pollen could perhaps take away our choice to
live GMO free, FOREVER.

However, the petroleum extraction, processing and transportation has a many sources of danger to the environment and thus for humanity. Firstly from human irresponsibility, to the destructive power of nature, can cause oil disaster, which can cause serious and long-term damage to our living environment, the economy and society.</b><br/><p>When oil spill occurs, there are various products in use removing the pollution. However, the problem with these products is that in many cases, whether the oil spill or a variety of chemicals and oil sorbents itself pose a greater damage on the environment. Therefore it is very important that the substance which we use for oil remediation is environmentally friendly, which do not cause further harm to the environment.<b></b></p><p>We offer the latest generation Oil Resist - our oil absorbent product, which is an important step forward in protecting the environment. Not only can it be used as a future oil spill response, but also can eliminate the existing contamination which has already occurred.</p><br/><p>It's always difficult to introduce a new product to the market, but we are committed to our goals and we are all making efforts to make our project successful.</p><p>Our campaign is designed to fundraise financial support and to spread the word about Oil Resist to people and organisations, who find it important to protect the environment and who may support us with our aims and goals.</p><br/><br/><p><b>Who we are</b></p><br/><p>TECDRY group was established in 2014, mainly due to the production and distribution of Oil Resist, which is made of 100% natural raw materials. With a greater emphasis being placed on the environment and the importance of protecting it, Oil Resist should be taken seriously as it provides a treatment which not only protects it also removes pollutants. We are dedicated beyond the production and distribution of Oil Resist as we do further development with our technology finding new applications to be used as widely as possible.</p><br/><br/><p><b>What Oil Resist is</b></p><p>Oil Resis is a fine powder with a 100% natural origin. It is capable of adsorbing of a wide variety of oils and oil derivatives, whether of plant, mineral or synthetic. The Oil Resist strongly binds the oil and this binding will be kept either dry or aqueous ambience. Furthermore it is suitable to remove oil stains, cleaning oily surfaces, areas and equipment, and can be used for remediation of oil contaminated soil.</p><p>The main content of Oil Resist is caustic lime - calcium oxide (CaO) - as well as the different plant derivatives. The lime is widely used in: construction industry (mortar, environmentally friendly whitewash), food industry (acidity regulator), pharmaceutical (anti-inflammatory). Due to the nature of its alkalinity it neutralizes the acidity, reducing the greenhouse effect. In agriculture it is used as an environment-friendly slug and worm killer as well as an excellent fungicide.</p><p>The discovery of Oil Resist is a fabulous story. Our enthusiastic team conducted research to develop an environmentally friendly waterproof additive, primarily for the production of waterproof plaster (used in construction). This work is mainly focused to modify the widely used lime making a water resistant additive. The developed material showed excellent hydrophobic properties during testing and made the plaster, plasterboard and the concrete to be waterproof.</p><br/><p>During the tests, a certain amount of powder accidentally fell down onto the floor, which was oil contaminated. When the floor was cleaned up the powder surprisingly removed the oil as well. The explanation is that the hydrophobic substances has a non-polar structure - such as oil, so the powder and the oil excellently attract each other. And as it has a very high specific surface area (about 25 m2 / g) it can be adsorbed in high amounts of oil.</p><br/><p>Oil Resist features:</p><ul>
<li><p>High specific surface area, it means very porous → high oil adsorbing capacity</p></li>
<li><p>Low specific gravity - lighter than the water and floats on the surface</p></li>
<li><p>Ease of use</p></li>
<li><p>100% hydrophobic</p></li>
<li><p>Environmentally friendly material - doesn’t contain any ingredients that are harmful to the environment </p></li>
<li><p>High thermal stability can be used against burning oil or fuel</p></li>
<li><p>Quickly eliminates the volatile hydrocarbon vapors, thus greatly reducing the risk of explosion!</p></li>
<li><p>If the oil has been already adsorbed to Oil Resist, the oil will not cause more damage to the environment. This means there is more time clean up operations</p></li>
<li><p>Can be integrated with existing technologies as well as machinery and equipment</p></li>
<li><p>Technology for the processing of residual materials are environmentally friendly.</p></li>

The main first task of oil spill response is to locate it quickly and prevent the oil spill spreading further, and the contamination reaching the shore. Then the oil removal can begin. Because the oil is flammable, it is very important that the remediation technology minimizes of this risk and is environmentally friendly as well.</p><br/><p>You can see using Oil Resist with oil spills on water in the following video. It is a fast and efficient solution for remediation, the adsorbed oil does not have further pollution on the environment and the final oil and Oil resist mixture will float on the surface which can then be removed by skimming and after that, processed in an environmentally friendly manner. </p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F_CMWuDQkhgs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D_CMWuDQkhgs&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F_CMWuDQkhgs%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p><i><b></b></i></p><p><i>Using Oil Resist on dry surfaces</i></p><b></b><p>Oil Resist effectively collecting oil on dry surfaces.

However, the petroleum extraction, processing and transportation has a many sources of danger to the environment and thus for humanity. Firstly from human irresponsibility, to the destructive power of nature, can cause oil disaster, which can cause serious and long-term damage to our living environment, the economy and society.When oil spill occurs, there are various products in use removing the pollution. However, the problem with these products is that in many cases, whether the oil spill or a variety of chemicals and oil sorbents itself pose a greater damage on the environment. Therefore it is very important that the substance which we use for oil remediation is environmentally friendly, which do not cause further harm to the environment.We offer the latest generation Oil Resist - our oil absorbent product, which is an important step forward in protecting the environment. Not only can it be used as a future oil spill response, but also can eliminate the existing contamination which has already occurred.It's always difficult to introduce a new product to the market, but we are committed to our goals and we are all making efforts to make our project successful.Our campaign is designed to fundraise financial support and to spread the word about Oil Resist to people and organisations, who find it important to protect the environment and who may support us with our aims and goals.Who we areTECDRY group was established in 2014, mainly due to the production and distribution of Oil Resist, which is made of 100% natural raw materials. With a greater emphasis being placed on the environment and the importance of protecting it, Oil Resist should be taken seriously as it provides a treatment which not only protects it also removes pollutants. We are dedicated beyond the production and distribution of Oil Resist as we do further development with our technology finding new applications to be used as widely as possible.What Oil Resist isOil Resis is a fine powder with a 100% natural origin. It is capable of adsorbing of a wide variety of oils and oil derivatives, whether of plant, mineral or synthetic. The Oil Resist strongly binds the oil and this binding will be kept either dry or aqueous ambience. Furthermore it is suitable to remove oil stains, cleaning oily surfaces, areas and equipment, and can be used for remediation of oil contaminated soil.The main content of Oil Resist is caustic lime - calcium oxide (CaO) - as well as the different plant derivatives. The lime is widely used in: construction industry (mortar, environmentally friendly whitewash), food industry (acidity regulator), pharmaceutical (anti-inflammatory). Due to the nature of its alkalinity it neutralizes the acidity, reducing the greenhouse effect. In agriculture it is used as an environment-friendly slug and worm killer as well as an excellent fungicide.The discovery of Oil Resist is a fabulous story. Our enthusiastic team conducted research to develop an environmentally friendly waterproof additive, primarily for the production of waterproof plaster (used in construction). This work is mainly focused to modify the widely used lime making a water resistant additive. The developed material showed excellent hydrophobic properties during testing and made the plaster, plasterboard and the concrete to be waterproof.During the tests, a certain amount of powder accidentally fell down onto the floor, which was oil contaminated. When the floor was cleaned up the powder surprisingly removed the oil as well. The explanation is that the hydrophobic substances has a non-polar structure - such as oil, so the powder and the oil excellently attract each other. And as it has a very high specific surface area (about 25 m2 / g) it can be adsorbed in high amounts of oil.Oil Resist features:
High specific surface area, it means very porous → high oil adsorbing capacity
Low specific gravity - lighter than the water and floats on the surface
Ease of use
100% hydrophobic
Environmentally friendly material - doesn’t contain any ingredients that are harmful to the environment 
High thermal stability can be used against burning oil or fuel
Quickly eliminates the volatile hydrocarbon vapors, thus greatly reducing the risk of explosion!
If the oil has been already adsorbed to Oil Resist, the oil will not cause more damage to the environment. This means there is more time clean up operations
Can be integrated with existing technologies as well as machinery and equipment
Technology for the processing of residual materials are environmentally friendly.
The area of remediationUsing Oil Resist on WaterPerhaps the biggest challenge with oil spills is when it happens on the water surface. The main first task of oil spill response is to locate it quickly and prevent the oil spill spreading further, and the contamination reaching the shore. Then the oil removal can begin. Because the oil is flammable, it is very important that the remediation technology minimizes of this risk and is environmentally friendly as well.You can see using Oil Resist with oil spills on water in the following video. It is a fast and efficient solution for remediation, the adsorbed oil does not have further pollution on the environment and the final oil and Oil resist mixture will float on the surface which can then be removed by skimming and after that, processed in an environmentally friendly manner. Using Oil Resist on dry surfacesOil Resist effectively collecting oil on dry surfaces. Suitable for industrial use, oil spill response at road accidents or any oil contamination of remediation during oil refining process. Simply sprinkle Oil Resist on to the oil, wait a few minutes until the oil is absorbed, then clear it up with a rough brush and a shovel. The fine-grained dust does not scratch the surface. See the following video:Using Oil Resist on wet surfaceAs you saw Oil Resist can be used either in water or on dry surfaces. In the following video you can watch how to collect diesel in these conditions.Other applicationsOil stain removal with Oil ResistOil Resist consists of very small particles that can penetrate into the irregularities of the surface and trap the tiny oil drops. It can be supported by a small amount of water to unbind the oil, using Oil Resist to remove oil stain is an effective environmentally friendly solution. Suitable for cleaning any hard even porous surfaces such as concrete, paving and tiles. You can see the process in the following video:Removing algae and mossThe lime has been known as an excellent long-lasting fungicide, it is
 an environmentally friendly solution removing algae and moss from 
patios, pathways or driveways.Just add a small amount of powder 
to the surface, scrub with a wet brush for a few seconds and wash the 
surface with water. You do not need chemicals!Cleaning and anti-slipping method for greasy surfacesWe can use Oil Resist for making an anti-slip surface at a greasy workplace . Sprinkle the powder on to the floor, leave it until sweeping up at the end of the day. The powder collects the existing oil-grease particles and binds all oil generated during the day giving a safe, non-slippery surface for the day. Environmentally friendly solution for the safe working area.Cleaning oil tankerThe oil tankers used to be cleaned internally by high pressure water with a special developed equipment. We can use Oil Resist for cleaning the oil contaminated water in site saving cost and water usage as the cleaned water reusable.Remediation of oil contaminated soilAs it is known, the oil is able to pollute large areas depending on its structure - especially encouraged by rain and groundwater washing. The oil-contaminated soil is unable to bind oxygen, thereby preventing the growth of plants, and also preventing the oil contaminated soil to be moisturized and stock water.There are more technologies for remediation of oil-contaminated soil, our studies aim was to find ways how to adopt the use of Oil Resist to existing technologies.  This importance is highlighted by the recent oil pipeline injury at south of Israel at Eilat-Ashkelon oil spill where millions of gallons of oil was spilt in the national park area. The restoration of the disaster is expected to take several years.In our laboratory experiments we investigated how we could apply Oil Resist into the remediation of oil-contaminated soil. The following examples illustrate some of the possible ways of use.Soil washingThe technology is based on where the soil is washed with water, thereby reducing the concentration of the pollutant. The main problem in this, is that the tiny oil droplets mixed in the water and is difficult, time consuming and expensive and many case it's not possible to clean the water in site.In the first experiment, we mixed well the oil-contaminated sand with water, then separated the contaminated water from the sand. We added Oil Resist to the contaminated water then mixed well again. The Oil  Resist has a very small (approx. 5 microns) particles powder, which easily absorbs oil droplets in water. About 20 minutes later the water cleared and the Oil Resist and oil mixture floating on the water where it could be easily removed by skimming. The purified water can be recycled. The skimmed Oil Resist can be reuse until the entire saturated has been reached.We mixed the Oil Resist and the oil contaminated sand in dry stage at our second experiment. The Oil Resist with its effective oil adsorbing capacity could pick up the oil from the sand during the mixing. After the stirring was completed, we added water and mixed well. Since the Oil Resist floated up as it lighter than the water even saturated with oil, after 20 minutes the oil and Oil Resist mixture could be easily removed by skimming. As a result, we got clean sand and water. The Oil Resist can be reused until it is fully saturated with oil.The mixture is the oil-saturated Oil Resist powder. As mentioned earlier, the adsorbent is made of only natural ingredients, so the powder does not has any dangerous effect for the environment. The mixture can be incinerated and the energy can be recovered, and also we have some successful experiment where we could recover the oil itself.StabilisationIn some cases the remediation is focused to stabilize or neutralize the oil in the soil. The Oil Resist absorbs the oil, the oil and the powder particles have a strong molecularly bind whereas the powder itself is hydrophobic, so this binding remains in an even contact with water. If we mix Oil Resist to the oil contaminated soil, the powder absorbs the oil and neutralizes its environmental impact. As the Oil Resist is environmentally friendly material, no further harmful effects to the environment.What our long-term plan is with Oil Resist Oil Resist is such an environmentally friendly material that it can be applied successfully in many areas, mainly due to the efficient oil adsorbent and water repellent properties. Application of Oil Resist provides an opportunity to adopt into the existing technologies, replacing those materials for the same purpose, which can be potentially harmful to the environment.What we already have doneThe Oil Resist formulation and technology is patented since 2010. There are available all necessary permits, quality certificates (TÜV, EMI) and safety data sheet  for the production and trading. There are available the full technology and equipment and the production has begun. There are two options for delivery: 15 kg bag and 1 ton big-bag  container. Councils, fire services, garages use it for oil spill response and cleaning oil contamination in Slovakia and the surrounding countries.We created our own Oil Spill Kit, which we offer for on the go. The kit includes 4 x 2 kg Oil Resist, scraper, brush, shoe covers, mask, gloves and a special shovel with a sieve in the middle.We already have presented the Oil Resist at several forums, and we are very proud of achieving  great success everywhere, because it offers a truly revolutionary and environmentally friendly solution. Trials were taken to  the Slovak and Hungarian National Rescue Service where they have been successfully tested on water and  land.

We are both certified scientific divers by the American Academy of Underwater Sciences (AAUS) and in the past two years we have dived on and documented 7 of the 27 platforms off the coast of California. We are also certified in CPR/FirstAid/O2 and covered by DAN insurance.

Who we are and what we want to do

Being a couple of young professionals with big experience in tourism sector of Cyprus economy we still keep being strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development of the island. More hotels and nice beaches must not necessarily mean more great habitat for
migrant birds being destroyed, more restaurants and tavernas must not mean more songbirds being trapped and killed.With respect to all that is being done by local and international NGOs, we want to approach to the problem from another side: to run an agressive media campaign to fight the demand for Ambelopoulia in local restaurants through tourist channels of the island:- Airports media channels- Digital signage in hotels- Public transport media- Informational blocks in island maps- Informational stands and leaflets in main points of tourism interest- ""SAY NO To Ambelopoulia"" signs in local tavernas and restaurants- etcThe quantity and width of the channels and the lenght of the campaign will depend on the funds raised with your support.

Some more tips for Cyprus future visitors:
 
1.  Talk about your enjoyment of birds with local Cypriots.
Many of them will be confused or bemused that you watch birds but don’t eat or
shoot them, but most will listen at least. Open their minds to the
possibility.
2.  When you come to Cyprus and go to a

smart enough not to put it on the menu (they know that it’s technically
illegal). If they serve ambelopoulia, walk out, and tell them why. If they

<p>Who benefits from this e-book? <i><strong>Everyone...</strong></i></p>
<p>""Knowledge is Power..."" Increased awareness of Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) issues facilitates a cleaner, healthier and safer environment. The Marine environment is highly susceptible to accidents in offshore oil and gas operations, many of which are preventable. Moreover, only until there is a viable renewable alternative will there be a perfect solution. Meanwhile, we can mitigate against such risks.</p>
<p>ICOE's e-book takes a comprehensive view of EHS best practices across both technical and non-technical areas of offshore operation. </p>
</div><div><p>With your help, our hope is for this publication to become the catalyst in a movement which will eventually incorporate and adapt our comprehensive EHS Principles and Practices transforming general industrial practice worldwide.</p></div><div>

From its inception, ICOE Research Limited has promoted EHS in the energy industry. Our e-book is not just an academic resource, it's a movement to promote health and safety in the workplace and increase environmental awareness worldwide. This e-book will be continually reviewed and updated, but we need your help...
 
What We Need & Why We Need It?

This project is a unique and major undertaking which requires funding to bring it to fruition.
Engaging over 50 professionals to research, write and edit this work requires effort and finance. Seventy-five percent of this e-book has been completed while 25% is being edited. But academic research requires continuous editing, illustration, graphics and use of copyright material. 
Our goal is to raise £100,000
 
You will receive these fantastic rewards for your contribution:

The Benefits
Who benefits from this e-book? Everyone...
""Knowledge is Power..."" Increased awareness of Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) issues facilitates a cleaner, healthier and safer environment. The Marine environment is highly susceptible to accidents in offshore oil and gas operations, many of which are preventable. Moreover, only until there is a viable renewable alternative will there be a perfect solution. Meanwhile, we can mitigate against such risks.
ICOE's e-book takes a comprehensive view of EHS best practices across both technical and non-technical areas of offshore operation. 
With your help, our hope is for this publication to become the catalyst in a movement which will eventually incorporate and adapt our comprehensive EHS Principles and Practices transforming general industrial practice worldwide.

<p><strong>THE PROBLEM</strong><br/><br/>It has become VERY clear that the ""powers that be"" who are in charge of protecting Lake Atitlan in Guatemala are not going to get the job done. In a country rife with corruption, any governmental funds end up lining pockets and local mayors have no plan of action. <br/><br/>Lake Atitlan is a world treasure; regarded as one of the most beautiful places on Earth. Tourism is booming and the human population around the lake is expanding at an incredible rate. The lake itself is in a crater and has no outflow so everything that flows in, stays in. This includes raw sewage from at least 20 towns (on and above the lake) and vast amounts of chemical fertilizers and pesticides from unsustainable agriculture.<br/><br/>Without a bunch of grassroots efforts like this one, the scientific agency in charge of monitoring the lake, <a href=""http://amsclae.gob.gt/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>AMSCLAE</u></a>, claims it will be dead within 7 years. Beyond destroying its natural beauty, the toxification of the lake threatens the livelihood of all who live here. At any given moment, roughly 20% of the population suffers from e-coli, amoebas, giardia and other intestinal pathogens. Something urgently needs to be done!<br/><br/><br/><strong>BIOREMEDIATION AS PART OF THE SOLUTION</strong><br/><br/>Bioremediation is the process of introducing beneficial natural organisms into an environment to combat harmful ones. In this case, we are talking about introducing <strong>Effective Microorganisms (EM)</strong> aka good bacteria which will digest and competitively exclude the bad bacteria and pathogens. These Effective Microorganisms are the ones that would normally inhabit a healthy lake. Think of it as probiotics for the lake!<br/><br/>I have extensive experience in bioremediation in the U.S. I worked previously for Sustainable Community Development (the company that brought EM to the U.S. from Japan) during which time we worked with the Jefferson City Waste Water treatment plant (Capital of Missouri) as well as dozens of other bio remediation projects.  I also managed 7 private lakes along the Missouri/Kansas border.  Now, I would like to set up a first EM station in Santiago, Atitlan to combat the pathogens in the Lake. </p>
<p>here is a study done by the City of Los Angeles on a pond with serious e-coli problems (also one of the major problems for Lake Atitlan).<br/><a href=""https://scdprobiotics.app.box.com/s/xgz8ewd1cfxtiq8nqn3gjhy8tnisnudp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://scdprobiotics.app.box.com/s/xgz8ewd1cfxtiq8nqn3gjhy8tnisnudp</a></p>
<p>Please take a few minutes to watch <u>this video</u> about EM. It says it all. 15 minutes well spent! <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVbFmKvBvU"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVbFmKvBvU</a></p>

<p>Case study of the City of Cartagena Columbia wastewater application.  EM only had 2.5 hours of retention time and reduced TSS (Total Suspended Solids) by 68% and BOD (biological Oxygen Demand) by 66 % and total coliforms (e-coli, etc) by 91%!</p>

<p>One major problem for local municipalities is the energy costs to run the waste water treatment plants around the lake (not a single one is operating at full capacity due to this problem). Here's a study done in India using EM with the main goal of reducing the energy costs of the waste water treatment plant by 50%. They hit the goal by achieving 54% energy costs savings as well as the always present reduction in all parameters of effluent.<br/><a href=""https://scdprobiotics.app.box.com/s/k7mrrlue399px8pwlq0lq0httlniq6qy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://scdprobiotics.app.box.com/s/k7mrrlue399px8pwlq0lq0httlniq6qy</a></p>
<p><br/><strong>THE FIRST PHASE: SANTIAGO</strong><br/><br/>Lake Atitlan is nearly 25 cubic kilometers in volume and cleaning it is a huge, but necessary undertaking. The key is starting small and scaling up. This campaign will fund the construction of a first EM facility in Santiago, Atitlan. It will produce roughly 500 gallons a week of concentrated EM. This will be given to local hotels, businesses, and community waste water treatment plants to get good bacteria into the sewage systems and the lake. It will also be given to several local organic coffee farming cooperatives to help them increase their yields and encourage more conventional chemical farmers to change to organic practices (chemical fertilizer runoff is another problem facing the lake).<br/> <br/><br/><strong>EDUCATION AS A KEY COMPONENT</strong><br/><br/>This campaign will also fund the beginnings of a community outreach program that will educate the local population on the use of EM in their toilets as well as sustainable organic agriculture to combat the use of chemical fertilizers. Simple and clear educational materials will be created in English, Spanish, Kaqchikel and Tz'utujil and free workshops and educational events will be held.  <br/><br/><strong>AN INTERCULTURAL COOPERATIVE EFFORT</strong><br/><br/>We are working closely with locals and community leaders in many of the towns around the lake, including Tzununa, San Pablo, San Pedro, and Santiago and have many volunteers here that are contributing their time and efforts to help this project succeed.<br/><br/><br/><strong>WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP</strong><br/><br/>We need these funds to set up the project and begin Phase 1. With one facility operational, we can garner much more support from larger sources. We are asking all Lake residents to lend their support, as well as the international community since we understand the power in working together.<br/><br/><br/>MORE RESOURCES ON EM<br/>There are hundreds or articles available on EM.  If you would like to know more about it just send me a message.</p>
<p>If someone wants to support this on a larger scale please get in touch with me.  Obviously the studies in the links above had more support then this small crowd sourcing campaign.  I am more than capable of setting up full scale projects to address the Lakes issues.  Please, everyone, let's pitch in and do our part.  A bunch of little donations will go a long ways using this technology.  We can do this!<br/><br/>Please join the Facebook group<br/><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/587800314734153/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>Lake Atitlan Environmental Interests</u></a></p>

Simple and clear educational materials will be created in English, Spanish, Kaqchikel and Tz'utujil and free workshops and educational events will be held.  AN INTERCULTURAL COOPERATIVE EFFORTWe are working closely with locals and community leaders in many of the towns around the lake, including Tzununa, San Pablo, San Pedro, and Santiago and have many volunteers here that are contributing their time and efforts to help this project succeed.WHY WE NEED YOUR HELPWe need these funds to set up the project and begin Phase 1. With one facility operational, we can garner much more support from larger sources. We are asking all Lake residents to lend their support, as well as the international community since we understand the power in working together.MORE RESOURCES ON EMThere are hundreds or articles available on EM.  If you would like to know more about it just send me a message.
If someone wants to support this on a larger scale please get in touch with me.  Obviously the studies in the links above had more support then this small crowd sourcing campaign.  I am more than capable of setting up full scale projects to address the Lakes issues.  Please, everyone, let's pitch in and do our part.  A bunch of little donations will go a long ways using this technology.  We can do this!Please join the Facebook groupLake Atitlan Environmental Interests

Plastic is one of the most widely used materials in the world and its production is growing immensely. However, it is estimated that approximately <b>10% of produced plastic ends up in the oceans</b>. Plastic pollution is an environmental problem spiraling out of control posing a threat to marine systems where it is now spreading globally to even the most remote habitats and to fresh water reservoirs. </div><div>

Inadequate waste management and increased human activities due to tourism even remote, pristine and vast areas are negatively impacted. Lake Baikal (Russia) is an example and in summer 2016 we are planning to investigate the presence of plastic contamination in the world's deepest, largest and oldest lake. We will sail and dive around the entire circumference of the lake to document the current ecological crisis which is threatening its ecosystem. 


Expedition Sacred Sea (the full story):

Lake Baikal - also called the Sacred Sea of Siberia is the largest reservoir of freshwater in the world, containing approximately 20% of the total unfrozen freshwater. It is also known as the clearest of all lakes and is a symbol of  unspoiled and unique nature with very rich biodiversity. It hosts more than 1,000 species of plants and 2,500 species of animals of which more than 80% of are endemic. These are all reasons it has been listed as a UNESCO natural world heritage site in 1996.

The new Baikal? 
Since 2008 dramatic changes of the ecosystem have been reported. This deterioration of the environmental health is caused by eutrophication, a process in which the water is saturated by phosphates and nitrates of human origin causing abnormal proliferation of some algae, cyanobacteria and phytoplankton. Last year it has been reported that this bloom covered almost entirely the water surface in shallow areas and in some places reached depths up to 40m. 





The source of pollution is increasing human activities and improper waste management. All changes have been very rapid and reported over a short period of time: the last 3-5 years.  Scientists call this dramatic situation a crisis that could affect the ecosystem irreversibly. The lake is turning into a swamp and many endemic species could be lost solely within this generation as the algea bloom interferes with spawning of the fish and by producing resilient toxins that can be dangerous also to human health.  Moreover 90% of Baikal sponges that can take over 200 years to grow to a size of over a meter are affected by an unknown disease and are now dying within one season.

The Plastic Problem 



Plastic is one of the most widely used materials in the world and its production is growing immensely. However, it is estimated that approximately 10% of produced plastic ends up in the oceans. Plastic pollution is an environmental problem spiraling out of control posing a threat to marine systems where it is now spreading globally to even the most remote habitats and to fresh water reservoirs.

Microplastics, particles less than 5mm in size, can be formed by fragmentation of larger plastic pieces, industrial ‘scrubbers’, micro-beads in cosmetics, and plastic nanoparticles used in industry.
The hazardous consequences of microplastic pollution in the marine environment are starting to be a cause of great concern. Microplastics are ingested across the entire food web from marine invertebrates to mammals, with severe effects on the health of the organisms. Furthermore, pollutants can adhere to microplastic particles and leaching of toxins can occur.

Microplastic pollution poses a serious threat to the environment leading to social, economic and health repercussions. Extensive research is being done mapping the distribution of microplastic in marine environments but their distribution in fresh water reservoirs still remains relatively unknown.

Our Aim: 
In order to address the problem of microplastic contamination we wish to: 

analyze for the first time plastic pollution in the lake Baikal 
compare distribution of plastics within the water column at sites with varying population densities
contribute to public available databases describing the distribution of plastics on a global scale
publish scientific papers

raise awareness on plastic pollution by presenting our findings in talks, articles and a short film 



Who we are: We are two SCUBA divers with extensive experience in adventurous and challenging conditions. During our surface intervals we are both lab based biologists interested in gene regulation and stem cells. This gives us the scientific skills to carry out this project. On our dives we have noticed an increase in plastic pollution also in remote areas, which greatly concerns us. We became interested in this problem and as scientists want to contribute to the research and to raise awareness of this global issue.

Plan of the Expedition & What We Need 
We will spend about 6 weeks in Lake Baikal travelling in a catamaran alongside a Russian sailing team around the entire circumference of the lake. 
On the way we will SCUBA dive and collect water samples from the surface and underwater to establish the levels of plastic contamination. We will also sample shore sediments, survey the shoreline and analyse fish stomach contents for the presence of plastic debris. 
We will also be taking lot of pictures & footage on land and underwater for a short movie documenting the current ecological situation in Baikal. 







We have covered our flights to Russia, diving and camping gear. We have also recently obtained dSLR camera and underwater housing, to be able to take high quality images and videos. Moreover, we obtained a generous support from a dive centre in Baikal that will kindly provide us with tanks, a portable compressor and a first aid oxygen kit to take on the catamaran. This will allow us to safely dive even in the most remote areas. 

We are asking for your help to cover our additional expenses including logistics (sailing, accommodation & food) and reagents and materials needed for the analysis of collected samples.
