<p>Thank you to everyone who has contributed thus far. You are beautiful, brilliant people and we really appreciate your support. You have helped us reach our target and ensure that Forest Fringe will definitely happen this summer. </p>
<p>However, if we can now raise a little more money in the last couple of weeks of the campaign there are a number of additional things we'll be able to do to make Forest Fringe really, really special this summer. I believe these are what people in the crowdfunding business call Stretch Goals.</p>
<p><b>£8000  - Forest Fringe Plus! </b></p>
<p>This year we're really excited to hopefully be collaborating again with the wonderful people at the Forest Cafe to host a whole mini-programme of shows at Forest Centre +, a massive former job centre in the centre of the city, with work by artists including Verity Standen, Volcano Theatre and Caroline Williams &amp; the Young Vic. Your support will make this new venue happen by helping cover the costs of artist accommodation, production management and some additional technical equipment to ensure this new venue is as well cared for as our other home at the Out of the Blue Drill Hall.</p>
<p><b>£9000 - Lunch for all Forest Fringe artists</b></p>
<p>Edinburgh is an incredibly exhausting and expensive place for artists, even those coming to Forest Fringe. Last year we were able to provide every artist at Forest Fringe with a meal on any day they were performing. This made a huge difference, not just to their ability to survive at the festival, but also to sense of community and togetherness we are trying to foster - artists and audiences eating and talking together and generally feeling part of something special. We'd love to be able to do this again. </p>
<p><b>£10,000  - Photographer and videographer-in-residence</b></p>
<p>In 2013 we were able to invite photographer Jemima Yong to come to Forest Fringe as a photographer in residence and she was able to produce <a href=""jemimayongphotography.format.com/forest-fringe-residency-edinburgh-2013"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this beautiful photo essay</a> documenting everything that happened at Forest Fringe. An additional £1000 would cover travel and accommodation for a photographer-in-residence and a videographer-in-residence, allowing us to document the festival, not only for our benefit and that of the artists, but for all the people who have supported us but aren't able to make it to the festival this summer.</p>
<br/><h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We have been running a free, totally
non-commercial venue at the Edinburgh Festival since 2007.<span>  <br/></span></p>
<p><span>They say that, in terms of exposure and opportunities, one good run at the Edinburgh
Festival is the equivalent of one good year in an artist's career.  Over the years the artists who have worked with us have gone on to win awards, to tour internationally, and to get rave reviews.  Every
year we are overwhelmed with applications from artists who have worked with us
before, and artists who want to work with us for the first time.  It's clear to us that we're offering something valuable to the careers of the artists we work with.  And over the years those artists have become a community for us.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>What makes us different from other Edinburgh
venues is that in addition to not charging artists or audience members (like
the Free Fringe), we also fund raise to cover all accommodation costs for our
artists, so that they can comfortably bring excellent, experimental,
non-commercial work to the Edinburgh Festival without worrying about losing
money.  </span></p>
<p><span>This is year for the third year in a row we'll be working with the brilliant people at Out of the Blue Drill Hall on Dalmeny Street just off Leith Walk to host Forest Fringe in their incredible space. </span></p>
<p><span>The venue is entirely run by volunteers - artists volunteer to run our box office, we volunteer to do the administration and running of the festival, and even our amazing tech team volunteer to run shows.  <br/></span></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>Despite the incredible value of people power, and the generosity of the Out of the Blue drill hall, there are still costs involved in running Forest Fringe.  We need money to rent the space, we need money to print programmes, and we especially need money to rent apartments for artists to stay in during the festival, so that artists aren't funding their own way.  <br/><br/>Forest Fringe is run by three
artists - Ira Brand, Andy Field and Deborah Pearson.  We don't get paid 
for our Edinburgh work - we
do it in our spare time, because over the years it's become clear that 
artists
presenting experimental work need us to keep going.  Now we need you to 
keep going.  <br/><br/>This is the first year that we are no longer
eligible for the generous Jerwood Foundation grant that we've received 
for the
last five years.  Because we've chosen to
forego the formal administrative structures of becoming a charity, there
 aren't
many foundations or even larger private donors that we are eligible to
approach.  This means that this year, if
we're going to make our venue happen and support the work of all the amazing artists we've programmed, we really need the community who 
have
worked with us, who have come to see our shows, and who have already contributed
 with
their attention and creativity, to step up and let us know that our Edinburgh venue matters to you.  <br/><br/>Please
think of a donation as buying a ticket to this year's festival - or think 
of it as
buying a ticket to last year's festival, or the festival the year 
before.  If everyone who has ever come to Forest Fringe donates £20 now, we will easily meet our target.<br/><ul>
<br/>
<p>Any money you donate will go directly to
either</p>
<p>a) The accommodation costs of our
artists.<span>  We put up around 20 to 25
artists every festival in shared accommodation.  This usually costs between around £6,000 and £8,000 at minimum.<br/></span></p>
<p>b) Technical equipment and support.<span>  This means our lighting rig, and rental of
our sound system. This usually costs around £2,000 at minimum.<br/></span></p>
<p>c)<span> 
The Accessibility Programme.  For
the last two years, Forest Fringe has been running an ""Accessibility
Day"" for hearing impaired audiences. 
We've built a strong relationship with hearing impaired communities in
Edinburgh and we would love to keep this going. This costs around £1,500 at minimum.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Printing our Programme.  This is so that you have a document letting you know what shows are on when.  This costs around £2,000 at minimum.</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to crowdfunding, we're also going to be running a fundraiser, and an online auction.  So there are plenty of different ways to give.  That said, because we do all of this in our spare time, the more money we can raise through this crowdfunding campaign, the more time we have to focus on organizing our Edinburgh events and supporting our Edinburgh artists, as opposed to organizing fundraising events.  So if by some wonderful and beautiful turn of events, we've already hit our £7,000 target for this crowdfunding campaign, we would really appreciate any further contributions you can give through this page.  We need to raise £15,000 total in a few short months, so the more people know about our campaign and give to it, the better.</span></p>

<p>AAC has a studio that provides art for the community in a unique and new way.  We turned restaurant salad bars into art bars for all you can make art experience.  We believe children should be given unlimited supplies, support and space to create...not direction, rules and instruction.  We want each child to express their own individual ideas of art and creation.  AAC provides 1 low rate, requires no parent clean up and does not have time or supply limits.  We believe this makes art inviting, accessible and affordable for all families.  We took it a step further by providing a discount for families that qualify for public assistance.</p>

graduation that there were few studio spaces and communities dedicated to
emerging artists in Baltimore, MD. Emerging artists, they noted, diminished in
their work capacity and eventually quit their studio practices after art school
mostly due to a lack of regular artistic studio community, as well as financial,
time, and space constraints. This desire for community and conversation
through visual arts is what propelled them to assemble a group of young
artists and to open Ash Street Studios.</span><br/></p>

<h1><b>What we are asking
for:</b></h1>
<p>We are asking for a total of $5000. As Ash Street Studios
aims to keep studios affordable for all artists within the community, there is
often little extra money available to tackle projects within the space that
benefit the community and the building it is located in. The first winter at
Ash Street was spent without heating, causing many artists to forgo working in
their studios during the colder months.</p>
<p>We are raising money to get:</p>
<p><b>Four Mr. Heater Big
Maxx natural gas garage-ceiling heaters</b> installed to evenly distribute heat
throughout the building. The quote for the heaters and the installation is <b>$3000</b>.</p>
<p><b>Our largest garage
door repaired</b> so that artists can move sculptures, paintings, tools, and
supplies through a working garage door. The quote for the garage door repair is
<b>$1500.</b></p>
<p><b>A commercial dumpster
service</b> started so that artists can dispose of their extra materials, wood
pieces, and general studio trash instantly, instead of waiting for trash-run
days where items are driven to the city dump. The price of a dumpster service
can range anywhere from <b>$200-$500</b>
with initial start-up fees. </p>
Any little amount that you
can give to help us reach our goals helps tremendously. Your generosity can be
the difference between a cold, unbearable winter to a warm, comfortable, and
productive winter for a group of emerging artists trying to build themselves
into stable practicing artists within the art world. <div>
<br/><div>
<h1><b>What you will receive:</b></h1>
<p>In return for your contribution, we are offering a variety
of perks that range from <b>original
artworks</b>, <b>prints in a limited series</b>,
<b>handmade books</b>, to <b>experiential</b> and <b>customized items </b>from Bone Black Press and our

What we are asking
for:
We are asking for a total of $5000. As Ash Street Studios
aims to keep studios affordable for all artists within the community, there is
often little extra money available to tackle projects within the space that
benefit the community and the building it is located in. The first winter at
Ash Street was spent without heating, causing many artists to forgo working in
their studios during the colder months.
We are raising money to get:
Four Mr. Heater Big
Maxx natural gas garage-ceiling heaters installed to evenly distribute heat
throughout the building. The quote for the heaters and the installation is $3000.
Our largest garage
door repaired so that artists can move sculptures, paintings, tools, and
supplies through a working garage door. The quote for the garage door repair is
$1500.
A commercial dumpster
service started so that artists can dispose of their extra materials, wood
pieces, and general studio trash instantly, instead of waiting for trash-run
days where items are driven to the city dump. The price of a dumpster service
can range anywhere from $200-$500
with initial start-up fees. 
Any little amount that you
can give to help us reach our goals helps tremendously. Your generosity can be
the difference between a cold, unbearable winter to a warm, comfortable, and
productive winter for a group of emerging artists trying to build themselves
into stable practicing artists within the art world.

Am Anfang war diese Idee:Wieso nicht einfach so dreist sein und Künstler werden?Bilder machen und berühmt werden? Das wupp´ ich! Wenn nicht jetzt, wann dann? Aus einer sehr flatterhaften und unüberlegten Spinnerei wurde jedoch sehr schnell Ernst und nun stehe ich vor der ersten Ausstellung, wer hätte es gedacht.Im Dezember darf ich zusammen mit 5 anderen Künstler - richtigen Künstlern, die das studiert haben und alles - 7 Bilder präsentieren.Nachdem die erste Euphorie verflogen ist, kommt jedoch langsam die Verwirklichung des Ganzen.Blöde nur, wenn man keine Kohlen für die Finanzierung der Bilder hat.Alle ""Kunstwerke"" existieren bis jetzt nämlich nur in digitaler Form.Die Fotografien, die ich mit Bildbearbeitungsprogrammen verändert habe, müssen schließlich ausgedruckt werden.Ich produziere jedoch keine Klein- sondern Großformate - das heisst, meine Bilder sind mindesten einen Meter breit - wegen dem Effekt versteht sich - wäre ja langweilig!Natürlich geht das ins Geld, welches ich nicht habe!Und bevor ich diese Chance einfach verstreichen lasse oder nur halbherzig angehe, wende ich mich an Euch mit der Bitte, mir ein wenig unter die Arme zu greifen!

Für die Ausstellung dachte ich an 700 Euro.Etwa 600 gehen an die Druckerei.Die soll die Bilder natürlich mit der bestmöglichen Qualität drucken.Bei einer Größe von etwa min. 100x50 cm wären wir schon bei min. 50 Euro, dann ist noch kein Rahmen dabei und die finale Größe ist eh noch nicht erreicht.Ich denke, Ihr versteht was ich meine.Es soll eben wirklich nach was ausschaun!

founded January 2013 in Berlin, Germany by Katrina Neumann<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/project/preview/www.katrinaneumann.squarespace.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a> (a visual artist).
Rate My Artist Residency acts in part as a public relations platform for
emerging and established residencies, alternative programming, and artistic
communities. The website promotes professional practices, links to other
residency resources, a peer review pen pal, and a calendar of upcoming events.
The main impetus for beginning Rate My Artist Residency was to create clarity behind
residency programs and allow artists to have a social platform to engage
anonymously and exchange information about their experiences. <br/></p><p>The<b> Artists Helping Artists Grant</b>
 is an idea launched from Rate My Artist Residency’s subtitle. One of 
the most difficult obstacles with artist residencies is being able to 
afford the residency. I want to utilize crowd-sourcing fundraising on <strong>indiegogo</strong>
 to create a grant that need-based artists in the United States can 
apply to unrestricted funding for a residency in 2015. The artists’ who 
apply to the grant must provide proof of need-based income and a letter 
from the residency with their acceptance in 2015. A jury will review 
finalists and select the recipients of the Artists Helping Artists 
Grant. The application for the grant will launch in Fall 2014 and the 
award will be announced in the new year of 2015.</p>
<p>The raised 
funds through this new initiative will be split into four portions and 
awarded to the selected artists. Currently, the fundraising goal is 
$2,000 USD and each artist will receive around $500 USD for the 
residency (indiegogo fees apply). The grant is unrestricted and used 
towards the residency as the artist sees fit; this includes residency 
fees, artist materials, studio space, travel, room, board, food, 
shipping, a portion of their apartment rent, etc. It is my hopes to 
raise more than the $2,000 USD goal to help artists receive a larger 
stipend this year and years to come.</p>

 more or less) will be split into four unlimited need-based residency 
grants. The grant is awarded to four artists that demonstrate a need for

grant allows the artist to attend the residency and be able to pay for

<p>Donors that

<h3><b>The Impact</b></h3>
<p>It goes 
without saying that for many years artists have benefited from residency
 programs around the world. Each program is an individual gem and at 
times a utopia for artists to temporarily exist. These programs give 
artists the vital time and space allowing them to work on their 
projects, ideas, and creation of contemporary culture. I always 
considered artist residency programs as an alternative business 
conference for the art world. Artists attend these spaces as think 
tanks, social network hubs, and pockets of conversation and dialogue 
analyzing our current and future position as a society in the world 
today. Artists are catalysts and act as the epitome representation of 
freedom in society. By supporting the works of artists, you are 
supporting progressive thought, change, challenging thought provocation,
 the right to a free equal society, and an individual working on 
cultural production.</p>
<p>Rate My 
Artist Residency was born from the idea of having a social platform for 
artists to communicate with each other about their residency 
experiences. The website launched over a year ago and today has over 900
 followers. In the past year, over 50,000 visitors from 100 countries 
visit the website to check out deadlines, residency profiles, and 
ratings of different residency programs. This is the first trial 
initiative of the grant through crowd-sourcing tactics; I hope that it 
finds great success and is able to continue for years to come.</p>
<p>Your 
contributions create a dynamic shift in grant giving through 
crowd-sourcing and contributing to the career of a need-based artist.

<br/><p>We have spent most of our personal time working on objects, presentations and website building, the last is something we know close to nothing about.

<p>If you are a user of building objects in revit you most likely share our frustration about the current building information objects. If you fund us you get beta access where you can download 150 objects that look as good as the picture attached, even more important is how light they are. You won't need a NASA computer to furnish the bedroom. If you fund a bit more you will also get a membership with the finished site where we will add objects at a daily basis.</p>
<p>If you are a designer or manufacturer and fund us, we will create your products in 3D and feature it on our site where it will reach architects all over the world. The objects will of course have description on where the product can be bought and a link back to your website. And the objects will be free to download for the public.</p>

We will have beta launch on the 1st of October, but we would like a professional website builder to help us with the finished product. This is why we are asking for funding. 
If you are a user of building objects in revit you most likely share our frustration about the current building information objects. If you fund us you get beta access where you can download 150 objects that look as good as the picture attached, even more important is how light they are. You won't need a NASA computer to furnish the bedroom. If you fund a bit more you will also get a membership with the finished site where we will add objects at a daily basis.
If you are a designer or manufacturer and fund us, we will create your products in 3D and feature it on our site where it will reach architects all over the world. The objects will of course have description on where the product can be bought and a link back to your website. And the objects will be free to download for the public.
We hope that you will fund us, and if you are in the business we hope that you can spread the good word.
Best regards,

Just as local art scenes within Trenton have been connecting and cross-pollinating lately, we believe it's time to connect with other like-minded artist groups in areas outside our city. With these connections made, we can invite artists back to Trenton in the coming years to help diversify our local art scene. This tour will not only help put Trenton on the map as an urban arts hub, but also build bridges for artists and performers to travel to and from our city.</ul>

<h2>She is Elle</h2>
<p>I am Nani, Elle's mother and one of her many big fans. We live simply in an eco-village. We live simply indeed and work very hard. I did not know that perhaps the greatest gift that I could give Elle would be technology. I've provided fresh air, good food, intellectuals and artists...all in a rural setting. I wanted to give her the best world that I knew to give her. All mothers want this. I was not equipt to provide computers and hardware. Technology is quite obviously a gateway to boundless creative adventures for Elle. Elle has taken to creating on line, exhibiting her humor, dance, music, graphics via a computer for the last few years. I ""inherit"" computers that would die and recover them...as best I can. Alas, our family has hit a point where my skills are far behind Elle's and I feel her bridled spirit. With your help another child, a native Hawaiian,  who has lived a life underserved will finally have a tool real and significant to boost her contribution to creativity!</p>
<h2><strong>Elle needs a high performing computer</strong></h2>
<h3>$2000 is our goal.</h3>
<p>When I've compared the technology I think will serve her the best for years to come it was in the ballpark of $1400-$2000. All monies that she raises and that are raised for her will feed her hungry artistic nature. Firstly, technology and then what ever else she may need: easel, a good camera, field trips to places like City Museum in St.Louis, mixing board, looping pedals, instruments. These are things that we only dream of at this point.</p>
<p>Elle already has excitement about gifting you with drawings, sketchups, character designs, sculptures, products that she creates for you. We also have artist and other contributing friends that will support Elle by gifting you with pottery, jewelry, and original works of art as well.</p>
<p>Every tribute will serve Elle. Should we not meet our goal, every coin still feeds back into her tool kit. If the half way mark, at the least, is met, then Elle will continue her fundraising towards a high quality computer. In the chance that we are less our half way mark, I will allow Elle the option to use her funds for something affordable that will continue to let her grow!</p>
<h2>I mentioned she is also working to raise funds.</h2>
<h3>Another way to help her and her grandma!</h3>
<p>Grandma, myself, and Elle came up with an entrepenurial way to symbiotically help Grandma and Elle. You too may assist these ladies (mini lady) and benefit with a fun investment...of a doll.</p>
<p>I imagine that you came to our campaign because you love artist and wanted to support an artist. We gladly accept your contribution and want to give you art. Elle also is able to give you a collectable dolly, courtesy of her very intense doll collecting grandma, at a lower that it's resell value in gratitude, in consideration of your contribution. Symbiosis? Elle collects 30% and %70 goes to grandma. G'ma, not so techy, 10 year old is very confident that she could move Grandma's dollies for her. We recognize the uniqueness of this proposal. It may be your cup o tea or not. If it is, let us know. Elle will be thrilled to be able to give Grandma money and earn some herself.</p>
<h2>You never know who wants to help:)</h2>
<p>Please tell your friends about us, post, or tweet. Heck, if you feel so inclined tell your local artist or nerd about us or nerdy artist...even better.</p>
<p>You may copy and paste into emails or bb's or forums any part of our campaign or simply use any tools indiegogo has to offer to make us <strong><em>POPULAR!</em> </strong> The more we are viewed and gifted to, Indiegogo will share our story up front and center, then the more likely we will succeed.</p>

<p>Artist Statement</p>
<p>My body of work “The Pirate Steals a Bride” is an exploration of relationships through the photographic process. I am recording moments which I recognize within the created environment of book, seeds, plant, soil— the beauty of growth coming through the pages, the beauty in a dying object, decay in life and the new and continuing relationship between two things that become completely connected, yet continually change each other.</p>
<p>I am setting up an implicit and explicit relationship between a book, specifically a romance novel and the seeds that will grow into plants by using the book as nutrients to grow. This relationship has many layers of meanings, at it’s simplest context— one decays and dies, so the other will grow and live. Which also acts as a metaphor for a sexual relationship.</p>
<p>An additional layer of content is the novel itself and the cover art of the embracing couple in the throws of lovemaking. The man is the hero in the novel and the woman needs rescuing is a running theme in the book’s text and on the cover. If the couple will overcome the obstacles in their way, they can be happy and together. A fantasy relationship which never existed and doesn’t in contemporary times, the dying book is a symbol of the death in the belief in a perfect relationship.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3>Why I need your help...</h3>
<p><strong>I went back to school to get my MFA in Studio Arts/Photography after being out of school for many years. I decided to go back to school in my 40s, so I could have more career opportunities. I love photography and want to continue my passion by teaching.<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong> I have been working on this project for over a year and it's time to show the work and finish my MFA. Professional mounting and presentation will make this work look the way it should, but costly. I am looking for help to complete the project and in return you will be listed in my catalog of the show and possibly have a beautiful print to hang on your wall. This project may turn into a book, if it does, you will be listed there as well.<br/></strong></p>

<p>Hello! My name is Krys and I am the head maker at Craftystuffs, a blog about making, upcycling and crochet, as well as a craft guild member of Alamance Makers Guild!  This past year, I have needed to take time off due to a number of personal reasons.  Now that I am back on my feet and have a new direction for the site, I am rearing to go!</p>
<p>    I am writing this in hopes that you can help me raise the necessary funding to re-launch my website, including FREE tutorials and be able to host giveaways.  I like making tutorials, both video and pictoral step by steps, from subjects ranging from crochet to making an upcycled display on the cheap!  I am also working on two books: One,about making stuff yourself and making it look GOOD, the other is an alternative crochet book, with tips on carpal wrist relief tips and crochet common sense.</p>
<p>    What I am seeking is only $1500 to help me get neatly squared away to start this endeavor.  A camera capable of macro and short video tutorials,  I am buying used and looking at a reasonable camera that fills these needs, as my digital point and shoot died a horrible death.  Internet hosting for the website/domain, supplies and tools for the tutorials, business cards, supplies for the make-it kits with make-it 'zine to accompany all the materials needed for some great projects, and some outlying costs for bringing the brand to life.  </p>
<p>    I am asking a very modest amount mainly because I have put much of my own time, sweat and money into this and would love to see this bring light to people who never thought they could crochet or make something themselves. </p>
<p>     I am offering awesome handmade items made by me, your name emblazoned on the site and a thank you card with illustration hand drawn by mois. I thank you all in advance for any contribution you can make.  I am not doing this to be rich, but to share the love of handcrafting... Something I am passionate about sharing!  </p>
<p>   Even if I do not reach My goal of $1500, my priority one is the camera so I can still do the tutorials. This will not change as everything else is just going to enrich the experience and make it possible to get the word out.</p>
<p>  Thank you for reading over the tutorial, This started with an operational cost of $5 a month for crafts, two years ago when a friend told me I had a gift for teaching different learning levels to make beautiful things. I also apologize for the ""video"", as I have no camera to make something high quality ( yet...)</p>

William J Nicolls, The Coal Catechism, 1898
 
 We are artists based in Berlin, Germany and Manchester, UK and we are looking for your support in the  production of a new video work.  

 
 
The Project
 
Song for Coal looks at coal as a cypher for the environmental and conceptual impacts of our carbon based economies and is based upon The Coal Catechism, an 1898 publication by William Jasper Nicolls.  The work looks at human induced climate change and explores apocalyptic fears present within our current understanding of the unfolding Century. It deals with the Industrial Revolution not as a distinct event that happened 150 years ago in north-west Europe but rather as an ongoing process that we are still caught up in.
 
By the end of this decade Coal is likely to rival oil as the world's biggest source of energy (see Guardian article).  It is a material which has conditioned the shift from agrarian to urban societies and as a driver of climate change will continue to define transformations in human life into the 21st century.
 

For producing this film we are working with a chorus of Opera singers to record the libretto (who've kindly agreed to donate their time to do so) and the complete work is scheduled for presentation at Yorkshire Sculpture Park in Autumn 2014.  

 
Normally we shoot our films indoors using an HDV camera.  For Song for Coal we will be going on location as well as doing hi-resolution imaging of the coal in motion.  For this we want to use particular equipment and we're hoping you can help us raise £2000 towards costs related to equipment hire.  This is for things like cranes and macro lens hire as well a high end RED camera for shooting details.  Your support will be used to make crucial elements of the work possible.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>In 2004 while living in Mexico, my husband and I produced a video documentary on the region's master artisans for the Mexican state of Michoacán's Casa de las Artesanias, or folk art center. That work grew into a small import business, with the goal of educating Americans about the mostly unknown artisans of Michoacán and promoting their extraordinary indigenous crafts in the United States. In the past six years we have represented numerous artisans by selling their work to galleries and museum stores and exhibiting at various prestigious crafts shows across the country. But it is the stories of the women artisans and their struggles that have touched and impressed me so deeply, that I now feel compelled to put my energies into producing an exhibit and video that focuses on these amazing women.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The traditional crafts of the indigenous communities in Michoacán have been recognized by international folk art collectors as well as historians and experts of Mexican popular art. But this extraordinary art, most of which has been passed down from generation to generation for over 500 years, is in danger of disappearing, due to lack of commercial market. The majority of these artisans are women who struggle to support their families with earnings from the sales of their work. Their stories are powerful and compelling, as they reveal their personal struggles as girls and women living in traditional villages where women historically have had no real value. This video and exhibit will focus on four award-winning, master craftswomen who are not only creating extraordinary art, but are changing their role as women in their families and communities. We seek to promote their work to Americans who are looking for unique, handmade art that will bring beauty to their own lives and in turn will help poor hardworking women in Mexico provide for their families. Everyone who has the opportunity to meet these women and see their work is changed forever, and it is our hope that through the power of video, we can also be able to bring an inspiring experience to the viewer.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Money will be used to produce a 30 minute video featuring several Indigenous women artisans from Mexico, which will be shown as part of an exhibit of the artists' work to be presented in several U.S. cities. <br/></p>
<p>We need funds for the video producers to travel to Mexico to shoot interviews, and to pay for post production costs, e.g. editing, subtitles,and studio sound production. We believe that it will be possible to receive support from Mexican agencies to transport the artists and their work to the U.S. for the exhibition, but we are seeking support for the production of the video/book project.</p>
<p>Any donation, no matter how small, is welcome!  Donors who contribute $100 or more will receive a complimentary DVD copy of the video. Those who give $200 or more will also receive a special invitation to the exhibition opening, and a 25% discount coupon towards the purchase of art from Mexico By Hand.<br/></p>

<h3><font color=""#000000"">Our Story</font></h3>
<p><em>prototype magazine </em>began in September 2011 as Laura Allen's final major project at University, little did she know that the magazine would grab her heart with both hands. The magazine helps to promote artists through The West Midlands (UK), providing them with a pedestal for their work to be published and recognised by influences within the creative industry whilst building their profile. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When <em>prototype magazine</em> began it was based solely on the promotion of Staffordshire based artists, however as popularity grew, within months we were expanding to promoting artists, designers, and makers through the entire region - this is expected to gradually widen and we hope within the next year we will be promoting artists throughout the UK. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>prototype magazine</em> is becoming a community; Laura Allen runs the magazine independantly with the amazing help and contributions of the artists. Laura hopes that the magazine will remain independant, we want our contributors to be a part of the development and growth, as nothing makes us happier than their success. The magazine provides networking opportunities and support for all contributors and readers, inviting them to access our creative network through Facebook and Twitter. We work together and firmly believe that in the current climate we all need to offer each other a helping hand in order to succeed<em>, prototype magazine</em> offers the hand of guidance to those practicing creative arts within our region...</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><em>prototype magazine</em> offers promotion, networking and a sense of community to artists, designers, makers and small businesses within The West Midlands. We provide our readers with information on upcoming talents and inform them of the inspiration which is occuring on their doorsteps, hopefully inspiring them to become involved themselves. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We hope to provide more than a print magazine, <em>prototype magazine</em> wishes to become a community and network of those practicing the creative arts throughout The West Midlands. It not only promotes the work of those who contribute to the magazine but rewards the artists and appreciates their work. Without <em>prototype magazine </em>there becomes a lack of print media within The West Midlands which supports those practicing the creative arts and disables a platform to network and progress in the creative industry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If this campaign does not work the rising costs of print media would disallow the magazine to continue; hense forth the amazing artists throughout our region lacking the opportunity to break the creative industry and build a network of popularity and industry contacts. <em>prototype magazine</em> wishes to remain a print publication as we feel there is no reward quite like seeing your artwork in a proffesional print format, and for those purchasing the magazine there is still something so special about print media that digital/online media lacks - it keeps our magazine truthful, it shows the hardwork and dedication and the real progression, that digital media sacrifices or can easily alter. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We wrap each magazine personally and ensure that every customer feels they are involved in <em>prototype.</em> Laura runs the magazine completely by herself, from putting the magazine together on her laptop, to monitoring social media, to reply to every email individually, to even posting each magazine. This campaign will allow Laura to progress the magazine, stabilising it to eventually employ staff and rent office space (and allowing her to take a second to breathe).<br/></p>
</div><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>Our intended goal through the funds raised is to secure one year of print funds for <em>prototype magazine</em>. </p><p> </p><ul>
<li>1 year of print costs secured (Cost per unit when purchasing 200 magazines is Â£4.44 (including VAT) = Â£888 for one print run of <em>prototype magazine</em>. Therefore the cost of 1 year (4 issues) = Â£3552)</li>
<li>Packagaing of magazines (Costs around 20p per unit!)</li>
<li>Run events four times a year to raise the profile of our contributors to the magazine, where they will be invited to exhibit their work and develop a personal rapore with our network base. </li>
</ul><p> </p><p>In the event that the goal is reached, these funds will be built upon to enable the business to strength and begin to higher staff, equipment, marketing and promotional material and rent.</p><p> </p><p>We do not yet pay the Editor, or those kind enough to offer their help with graphic design of the magazine, marketing and PR. It would be an excellent stepping stone if in a year we have made enough money to be settled into a rented office space, with a team of employed graphic designers and marketing assistants (We even already have some in mind!). </p><p> </p><p>For now though, being able to cover the cost of print for one year is a massive weight of our shoulders and to thank you for your donation, whether it be Â£1 or Â£1000 we have set up some rewards for each;</p><p><strong></strong> </p><p><strong>Like us on Facebook, follow us on Twitter and share our campaign</strong></p><p>We will thank you on our website and send you 20% off a 1 year subscription. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Donate Â£1</strong></p><p>We will thank you on our social media and our website, send you 20% off anything on our Etsy shop.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Donate Â£5 </strong></p><p>You have a fiver lurking in your back pocket that you wouldn't miss, we will give you 25% off anything on our Etsy shop and a ticket to our launch party.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Donate Â£10 </strong></p><p>You think <em>prototype magazine </em>is on to a good thing - we will send you a VIP ticket to our launch party + 25% off Etsy and a PDF copy of the third issue so you can see what you are contributing to!</p><p> </p><p><strong>Donate Â£50</strong></p><p>You have seen a new pair of Vans, but you think they can wait until next month - you would much rather help support the artists, designers and small businesses within your region make it big. As a thank you, we will offer you a VIP ticket to our launch, half price 1 year subscription to <em>prototype magazine </em>and you get a half page advert to showcase your talents/business in our fourth issue, and on our website!</p><p> </p><p><strong>Donate Â£100</strong></p><p>You are feeling generous, Â£100 would print 20 magazines and let us breathe a sigh of relief.

You would help to raise the profiles of so many new and emerging artists, small business and designers through The West Midlands, allow us to print the third issue and even have change to make our launch party go off with a bang (We will get to pay our fantastic marketing and PR guy a nice reward himself!) You get all above perks, plus advertising in 1 year of <em>prototype magazine </em>(4 issues).</p><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you don't have a penny to spare, <em>prototype magazine</em> is a creative community; you can help us build this by following us on our social media sites, talking to your friends and associates about us and sharing your findings. We are holding our launch party in May which will help to promote <em>prototype magazine</em> to the public and those who influence the creative industry, we would be honoured if you can join us for an evening of live music, an art exhibition, bar and poetry reading - even purchasing a ticket will put a few pounds in our pot for printing our next issue, tickets are available from <a href=""http://www.prototypemagazine.bigcartel.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.prototypemagazine.bigcartel.com</a> :)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We really wouldn't ask unless we needed your help. Really, whether it is Â£5 or Â£500 from the bottom of my heart I am grateful that you have taken the time to appreciate the prototype magazine project, as well as funding it. </p>

Packagaing of magazines (Costs around 20p per unit!)
Run events four times a year to raise the profile of our contributors to the magazine, where they will be invited to exhibit their work and develop a personal rapore with our network base. 
 In the event that the goal is reached, these funds will be built upon to enable the business to strength and begin to higher staff, equipment, marketing and promotional material and rent. We do not yet pay the Editor, or those kind enough to offer their help with graphic design of the magazine, marketing and PR. It would be an excellent stepping stone if in a year we have made enough money to be settled into a rented office space, with a team of employed graphic designers and marketing assistants (We even already have some in mind!).  For now though, being able to cover the cost of print for one year is a massive weight of our shoulders and to thank you for your donation, whether it be Â£1 or Â£1000 we have set up some rewards for each; Like us on Facebook, follow us on Twitter and share our campaignWe will thank you on our website and send you 20% off a 1 year subscription.  Donate Â£1We will thank you on our social media and our website, send you 20% off anything on our Etsy shop. Donate Â£5 You have a fiver lurking in your back pocket that you wouldn't miss, we will give you 25% off anything on our Etsy shop and a ticket to our launch party. Donate Â£10 You think prototype magazine is on to a good thing - we will send you a VIP ticket to our launch party + 25% off Etsy and a PDF copy of the third issue so you can see what you are contributing to! Donate Â£50You have seen a new pair of Vans, but you think they can wait until next month - you would much rather help support the artists, designers and small businesses within your region make it big. As a thank you, we will offer you a VIP ticket to our launch, half price 1 year subscription to prototype magazine and you get a half page advert to showcase your talents/business in our fourth issue, and on our website! Donate Â£100You are feeling generous, Â£100 would print 20 magazines and let us breathe a sigh of relief. Your generosity will be rewarded with all of the perks above, plus a full page advertisement and a 1 year subscription of prototype magazine. Donate Â£1000 Well this would just be fantastic. You would help to raise the profiles of so many new and emerging artists, small business and designers through The West Midlands, allow us to print the third issue and even have change to make our launch party go off with a bang (We will get to pay our fantastic marketing and PR guy a nice reward himself!) You get all above perks, plus advertising in 1 year of prototype magazine (4 issues).
Other Ways You Can Help
Even if you don't have a penny to spare, prototype magazine is a creative community; you can help us build this by following us on our social media sites, talking to your friends and associates about us and sharing your findings. We are holding our launch party in May which will help to promote prototype magazine to the public and those who influence the creative industry, we would be honoured if you can join us for an evening of live music, an art exhibition, bar and poetry reading - even purchasing a ticket will put a few pounds in our pot for printing our next issue, tickets are available from www.prototypemagazine.bigcartel.com :)
 
We really wouldn't ask unless we needed your help. Really, whether it is Â£5 or Â£500 from the bottom of my heart I am grateful that you have taken the time to appreciate the prototype magazine project, as well as funding it. 
 
My greatest thanks and gratitude,

The launch date should be at the end of the year but people who have purchased it via the campaign will receive them in exclusive preview by October or November! You’ll be able to choose a scent from the collection designed by us, and batched in our lab in London using the finest perfumery ingredients sourced from the best producers. When will I receive my perks?Once the campaign finishes mid-August, we'll start shipping the box sets, so you should expect them late August or September. The fragrances from the upcoming collection will be sent when the production starts in autumn (around October/November). What's in our ingredient sets?Our ingredient sets and perfume-making box is a unique way of discovering perfumery ingredients, testing your nose - so if you can't make your way to the Lab in London, why not having a bit of it at home?We know that for individuals, it’s often hard to get your hand on trade-quality ingredients without having to spend too much money. All our ingredients are sourced from leading ingredients manufacturers and are some of the best quality you can find. They are the same ingredients we use at the Lab. To be true to the perfumer’s organ, our selection contains both natural and aroma chemicals. There are four ingredients sets you can choose from including 5, 15, 30 or 45 vials of 2,5ml each. Box sets will contains essential ingredients and material to start blending at home (the selection differs from one box set to the other). Examples of ingredient includes Bergamot Oil, Jasmine Absolute, Patchouli Oil, Vetiver Oil and molecules such as Hedione, Stemone, Calone, Coumarine, Iso E Super etc... The list can be sent before purchasing on request.  Important note: All our ingredients are pre-diluted in perfumer’s alcohol at 10%, 5% or 1% (or dipropylene glycol when sent outside UK), allowing an easier access into testing them and blending them. What about shipping?Our shipping cost will vary based on country. We are based in the UK, so we will use Royal Mail to send in the UK at low cost. For shipping abroad, we’ll use Royal Mail for the ingredient sets and fedex for sending the 50ml bottles of our upcoming collection. For the 50ml fragrance bottle of our upcoming collection, the indicated shipping cost outside the UK is likely to be higher than other rewards. Unfortunately this corresponds to the unique shipping cost of flammable goods, which need to be handled by the carrier with a particular degree of care. Thank you for your support! EPC is a growing community of perfume makers, and there are a number of people who have played a key role in making this adventure happen. We are hugely grateful to all the individuals and business that have been involved in this incredible project so far, and thank you from the bottom of our hearts.",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi.
I’m Deborah. I’m originally from New York, but I’ve lived in Turkey for over 20
years, and I’ve been making art for a long time. I use my artwork to try and
get people to examine their relationships with the planet and with each other. I
like to create installations that are put together out of many small individual
pieces. My work often includes a ‘subtext’ about the role art plays in how we ‘see’
the world.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">This
fall, I’ll be participating in the 2nd Bodrum Biennial. The exhibition will be
held from 12 September-12 November at the Museum of Underwater Archaeology (‘The
Castle’) and other venues in Bodrum, Turkey. It is expected to attract upwards
of 50,000 visitors. The installation I’m planning on exhibiting (and which will cost about 1,000 USD to construct) looks at the
biennial’s theme, ‘Tolerance’, in relation to women in contemporary Turkish
society. My aim is to raise awareness about violence against women while at the
same time trying to encourage a sense of empathy for people who are ‘different’
than us.</span></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436772236/ssrubyagivmkzmwxjyfy.jpg"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; width: 416.564315352697px; height: 267px; background-color: initial;""/><br/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Why am I doing this? I guess I just think that if we can be a little more understanding of each other, we might be a little nicer, a little more patient, and a little less likely to try and do each other harm.</span></p><p>Because I’m taking on a serious subject, I’ve designed (one might even say ‘disguised’) my installation to look like a ‘tourist attraction’ to get people involved with the piece rather than scare them away. <b>(If <i>you'd </i>rather read about the details of the artwork itself before getting into any ‘heavy stuff’, just scroll down to the section on ‘THE PROJECT’.)</b></p><p><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 30px; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 38px; background-color: initial;"">THE BACKGROUND</b><br/></p>
<p>I
first developed the idea for the installation ‘Have Your Photograph Taken as an
Ottoman Princess’ in response to an article I read a few years ago somewhere on
the Internet that said a man in Izmir, Turkey, who had been convicted of
murdering his wife, had had his sentence reduced by the court on the grounds
that the murdered woman ‘had provoked her husband by wearing jeans’. </p><p>I found that unbelievably shocking - and I'm sure you do, too - but I later learned that this was <i>not</i> a one-off 'mistake': It is not uncommon that a Turkish court has ruled a woman's 'revealing' dress to be 'provocation' for murder. (Other things the courts have considered provocation have included 'not cooking dinner' and 'asking for a divorce'.)</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436977019/eyiaq6utet8k5acd5tj1.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 401.41592920354px; height: 216px;""/></p><p></p><p></p><p>With such a dismissive attitude on the part of the State, it is not surprising to find that a recent UN report estimated that 41.9% of women in Turkey experience physical or sexual violene by a domestic partner at some point in their lives. (A recent article from <a href=""https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/02/16/dispatches-one-more-victim-turkeys-empty-promises-women"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Human Rights Watch</a> helps to explain the extent of the problems facing women in Turkey.)</p><p>Of
course, violence against women is not limited to Turkey; a low-ball estimate
for the prevalence of violence against women worldwide (including
physical/sexual violence by a domestic partner and sexual violence by a
stranger, according to the World Health Organization,) is 30 percent; in other
words, 1 in 3 women will be a victim of physical/sexual abuse in her lifetime.</p>
<blockquote><i><b><i><b>The key to tolerance is empathy. Empathizing with ‘people like us’ is easy – but developing empathy and showing tolerance for people who appear to be different may take work. By allowing people to try on different identities as easily as they would try on clothes, my installation ‘Ottoman Princess’ aims to help us see that as human beings, we all share much more in common than we might think.</b></i><i><b></b></i></b></i></blockquote>
<p>Women
have had a particularly tough time in Turkey over the past decade. The
government is alternatively perceived as a champion of democracy and religious
freedom and as an authoritarian, borderline dictatorship bent on eroding the secularism,
i.e. the ‘separation of church and state’, that has been central to the
nation’s identity since its founding in 1923.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436799089/lgvw8onlfo6wqcx2bgel.jpg"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; width: 281px; height: 281px; background-color: initial;""/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A
single article of women’s clothing – the headscarf – has become a symbol of the
divisive issue of the role of religion in Turkish society. At one extreme,
there are those who view a ‘covered’ woman as a sign that Turkey is heading
towards a Taleban-style theocracy in which women will lose all the freedoms
they presently enjoy. At the other extreme, there are those who view
‘uncovered’ women as a sign that Turkish society and traditional values are
being destroyed by Western decadence.</span><br/></p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">In
fact, as far as I can tell, most of the country lies somewhere in between. Unfortunately,

<p><b>Have Your
Picture Taken as an Ottoman Princess</b> will be exhibited at the Bodrum Museum of
Underwater Archaeology (‘The Bodrum Castle’) as part of the 2015 Bodrum
Biennial from 12 September-12 November 2015. The installation will consist of nine
life-sized figures of women, along with an old-fashioned photographer’s tripod
and a sign reading “Have Your Picture Taken as an Ottoman Princess”.</p>
<p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436790261/cmrbntwlnm1ykh9if5dn.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 415.562264150943px; height: 266px;""/></p><div>The ‘Princess’ image I’m adapting
from a 19<sup>th</sup>-century engraving. For the other 8 figures, I’m using photographs
of women I took on the street in Istanbul and Bodrum (or ‘borrowed’ from the
Internet), and I’m now in the process of transforming them on the computer into
sketches that I can use to make watercolor-and-ink drawings in the same ‘Orientalist’
style of the ‘Princess’. As you can see from the sketches here, the figures will
run the spectrum ‘from the exposed to the enclosed’, but they will all share a
similar feel of a watercolor portrait, <i>sans</i>
<i>visage</i>.<br/>
</div><p>
</p><p>Once the drawings are
finished, I’ll turn them over to a sign company (this is the expensive part),
and they’ll make me life-sized figures out of ‘forex’ signboard, cutting out a
hole in place of the face and adding a metal base to stabilize
them. That way, when the figures are displayed outside the Bodrum Castle as
part of the biennial exhibition, visitors will be able to place their own faces
through the hole in each figure and take photographs of themselves as an
Ottoman Princess or any of eight different ‘types’ of women in Turkey today. Moreover,
anyone who ‘poses’ for a ‘selfie’ (the ‘photographer’s tripod’ is just a decoy –
people will have to take their own photos) will be able to post their pictures
to Instagram and to a Facebook page (Ottoman Princess) . </p>
<p>Now for ‘the catch’: Anyone
who decides to pose for a photograph will be confronted with a text printed on
the back side of each figure. The texts will provide some basic details about a
particular legal decision in which a woman’s dress was ‘ruled’ provocation for
a violent attack, as well as contact information about organizations working to

<p>Merhaba. Adım Deborah. Aslen New Yorkluyum ama 20 yıldan fazla süredir
Türkiye’de yaşıyor ve uzun zamandır sanatla uğraşıyorum. Sanatımı insanları gezegenimizle
ve diğerleriyle olan ilişkilerini incelemeye teşvik etmek amacıyla yapıyorum. En sevdiğim şey birçok tekil parçalardan oluşturulan alan
kurguları yaratmak. Çoğu zaman çalışmalarımda dünyaya ”bakışımızda” sanatın
rolüne dair gizli bir anlam vardır. </p>
<p>Sergilemeyi planladığım alan kurgusu çağdaş
Türk toplumunda kadına dair “Hoşgörü” temasını inceliyor. Hedefim bir yandan
kadına karşı şiddet konusunda bir bilinç oluştururken, aynı zamanda kendinden “
farklı “ olana karşı “anlayış” gösterme duygusunu teşvik etmek. </p>
<p>Bunları neden yapıyorum? Sanırım sadece ötekini
biraz daha anlayabilsek, biraz daha iyi davransak, az daha sabırlı olsak
birbirimize daha az zarar verme olasılığı olduğunu düşündüğümdendir.</p>
<p>Ciddi bir konuyu ele aldığımdan dolayı, bu alan kurgusunu  insanları korkutup kaçırmaktan çok onların da
bir parçası olmasını sağlayacak şekilde bir “turistik çekim” noktası olarak
tasarladım (hatta örtüledim bile denilebilir).(“Ağır
konulara” girmeden önce sadece sanat eserinin kendisi hakkında detayları okumak
<i>istiyorsanız</i>, aşağıda “<i>PROJE</i>” kısmına atlayabilirsiniz ).</p>
<p></p>
<h2><b>ARKA PLAN BİLGİ</b></h2>
<div>
<b></b><p>“Bir Osmanlı Prensesi Gibi Fotoğraf Çektirin” adlı alan kurgusu fikrini ilk
kez internette Türkiye’nin İzmir şehrinde eşini öldürmekten mahkûm olan bir
adamın cezasında katledilen kadının “kot pantolon giyerek eşini tahrik ettiği”
nedeniyle indirime gidildiğine dair okuduğum bir habere tepki olarak
geliştirmiştim.</p>
<p>Benim için inanılmaz derecede sarsıcıydı bu – ve eminim sizin için de
öyledir – ancak, bunun bir seferliğine yapılan bir “hata” olmadığını öğrendim: Türk
mahkemesinin  “dekolte” kıyafetin kadının
katledilmesi için bir “tahrik” unsuru olduğu kararı vermesi olağandışı bir şey
değil. (Mahkemelerin tahrik unsuru olarak kabul ettikleri diğer şeyler arasında
“akşam yemeğinin hazırlanmaması” ve “boşanmak istemek” de var.)</p>
<p>Devletin bu konuda takındığı ilgisiz tavra bakıldığında, yakın zamanda
hazırlanan bir BM raporunda Türkiye’de kadınların %41,9’unun yaşamlarının bir
noktasında ev içi fiziksel ve cinsel şiddete maruz kaldığının ifade edilmesi
hiç de şaşırtıcı değil. </p>
<p>Şüphesiz, kadına karşı şiddet sadece Türkiye ile sınırlı değildir; dünya
çapında kadınlara uygulanan şiddetin ne seviyede olduğuna dair tahmin (Dünya Sağlık
Örgütü’ne göre ev içi fiziksel/cinsel şiddet ile yabancı birisi tarafından
uygulanan cinsel şiddet de dâhil olmak üzere ) yüzde 30 olup; diğer bir deyişle
her 3 kadından 1 tanesi yaşamlarında fiziksel/cinsel şiddet mağduru olacaktır.</p>
<blockquote><b><i>Hoşgörünün anahtarı
başkalarının duygularını anlamaktır. “Kendimize benzeyen insanların”
duygularını anlamak kolaydır ancak, 
farklı görünen insanlara karşı anlayış göstermek ve hoşgörülü olmak
biraz çaba gerektirecektir. “Osmanlı Prensesi” adlı alan kurgum insanların
kıyafet değiştirmek gibi kolay bir şekilde farklı kimlikleri denemesine izin
vererek, birer insan olarak düşündüğümüzden çok daha fazla ortak noktaları
paylaştığımızı görmeye yardımcı olmayı hedeflemektedir. </i></b></blockquote>
<p><b><i></i></b></p>
<p>Geçtiğimiz on yılda Türkiye’de kadınlar özellikle zor bir dönem geçirmişlerdir. Hükümet bir yandan demokrasi ve dini özgürlüğün lideri olarak algılanırken diğer yandan da laikliği erozyona uğratan otoriter, tam sınırda bir diktatörlük olarak algılanmaktadır,</p>
<p>Kadın kıyafetlerinden bir tanesi - başörtüsü - Türk toplumunda dinin ayrıştırıcı rolünün bir sembolü haline geldi. Bu durumu bir uçta Türkiye’de kadınların şu anda var olan özgürlüklerini kaybedecekleri Taliban tarzı bir teokrasiye doğru gidişatın işareti olarak görenler var iken, diğer uçta Türkiye’de  “açık”  kadınları Türk toplumu ve geleneksel değerlerinin Batı Yozlaşmışlığı tarafından tahrip edilmesinin işareti olarak görenler bulunmaktadır.  .</p>
<p>Aslına bakarsanız, benim bildiğim kadarıyla, ülkenin çoğu bu iki bakışın ortasında bir yerlerde durmaktadır. Ne yazık ki, inanılmaz derecede çeşitli yaşam biçimleri ve inançlarımıza karşılık, bu çeşitliliği tanımak ve onaylamaktaki isteksizlik kadınları kutuplaştırmakta ve kadını koruyup, haklarımızı garantiye almak açısından, ileri adım atma çabalarını bir anlamda engellemektedir.</p>

Hi.
I’m Deborah. I’m originally from New York, but I’ve lived in Turkey for over 20
years, and I’ve been making art for a long time. I use my artwork to try and
get people to examine their relationships with the planet and with each other. I
like to create installations that are put together out of many small individual
pieces. My work often includes a ‘subtext’ about the role art plays in how we ‘see’
the world.This
fall, I’ll be participating in the 2nd Bodrum Biennial. The exhibition will be
held from 12 September-12 November at the Museum of Underwater Archaeology (‘The
Castle’) and other venues in Bodrum, Turkey. It is expected to attract upwards
of 50,000 visitors. The installation I’m planning on exhibiting (and which will cost about 1,000 USD to construct) looks at the
biennial’s theme, ‘Tolerance’, in relation to women in contemporary Turkish
society. My aim is to raise awareness about violence against women while at the
same time trying to encourage a sense of empathy for people who are ‘different’
than us.Why am I doing this? I guess I just think that if we can be a little more understanding of each other, we might be a little nicer, a little more patient, and a little less likely to try and do each other harm.Because I’m taking on a serious subject, I’ve designed (one might even say ‘disguised’) my installation to look like a ‘tourist attraction’ to get people involved with the piece rather than scare them away. (If you'd rather read about the details of the artwork itself before getting into any ‘heavy stuff’, just scroll down to the section on ‘THE PROJECT’.)THE BACKGROUND
I
first developed the idea for the installation ‘Have Your Photograph Taken as an
Ottoman Princess’ in response to an article I read a few years ago somewhere on
the Internet that said a man in Izmir, Turkey, who had been convicted of
murdering his wife, had had his sentence reduced by the court on the grounds
that the murdered woman ‘had provoked her husband by wearing jeans’. I found that unbelievably shocking - and I'm sure you do, too - but I later learned that this was not a one-off 'mistake': It is not uncommon that a Turkish court has ruled a woman's 'revealing' dress to be 'provocation' for murder. (Other things the courts have considered provocation have included 'not cooking dinner' and 'asking for a divorce'.)
With such a dismissive attitude on the part of the State, it is not surprising to find that a recent UN report estimated that 41.9% of women in Turkey experience physical or sexual violene by a domestic partner at some point in their lives. (A recent article from Human Rights Watch helps to explain the extent of the problems facing women in Turkey.)Of
course, violence against women is not limited to Turkey; a low-ball estimate
for the prevalence of violence against women worldwide (including
physical/sexual violence by a domestic partner and sexual violence by a
stranger, according to the World Health Organization,) is 30 percent; in other
words, 1 in 3 women will be a victim of physical/sexual abuse in her lifetime.
The key to tolerance is empathy. Empathizing with ‘people like us’ is easy – but developing empathy and showing tolerance for people who appear to be different may take work. By allowing people to try on different identities as easily as they would try on clothes, my installation ‘Ottoman Princess’ aims to help us see that as human beings, we all share much more in common than we might think.
Women
have had a particularly tough time in Turkey over the past decade. The
government is alternatively perceived as a champion of democracy and religious
freedom and as an authoritarian, borderline dictatorship bent on eroding the secularism,
i.e. the ‘separation of church and state’, that has been central to the
nation’s identity since its founding in 1923.A
single article of women’s clothing – the headscarf – has become a symbol of the
divisive issue of the role of religion in Turkish society. At one extreme,
there are those who view a ‘covered’ woman as a sign that Turkey is heading
towards a Taleban-style theocracy in which women will lose all the freedoms
they presently enjoy. At the other extreme, there are those who view
‘uncovered’ women as a sign that Turkish society and traditional values are
being destroyed by Western decadence.In
fact, as far as I can tell, most of the country lies somewhere in between. Unfortunately,
despite our incredible diversity of lifestyles and beliefs, a reluctance to
acknowledge and accept this diversity has polarized women, doing little to move
forward efforts to protect women and ensure our rights.THE PROJECT
Have Your
Picture Taken as an Ottoman Princess will be exhibited at the Bodrum Museum of
Underwater Archaeology (‘The Bodrum Castle’) as part of the 2015 Bodrum
Biennial from 12 September-12 November 2015. The installation will consist of nine
life-sized figures of women, along with an old-fashioned photographer’s tripod
and a sign reading “Have Your Picture Taken as an Ottoman Princess”.
The ‘Princess’ image I’m adapting
from a 19th-century engraving. For the other 8 figures, I’m using photographs
of women I took on the street in Istanbul and Bodrum (or ‘borrowed’ from the
Internet), and I’m now in the process of transforming them on the computer into
sketches that I can use to make watercolor-and-ink drawings in the same ‘Orientalist’
style of the ‘Princess’. As you can see from the sketches here, the figures will
run the spectrum ‘from the exposed to the enclosed’, but they will all share a
similar feel of a watercolor portrait, sans
visage.

Once the drawings are
finished, I’ll turn them over to a sign company (this is the expensive part),
and they’ll make me life-sized figures out of ‘forex’ signboard, cutting out a
hole in place of the face and adding a metal base to stabilize
them. That way, when the figures are displayed outside the Bodrum Castle as
part of the biennial exhibition, visitors will be able to place their own faces
through the hole in each figure and take photographs of themselves as an
Ottoman Princess or any of eight different ‘types’ of women in Turkey today. Moreover,
anyone who ‘poses’ for a ‘selfie’ (the ‘photographer’s tripod’ is just a decoy –
people will have to take their own photos) will be able to post their pictures
to Instagram and to a Facebook page (Ottoman Princess) . 
Now for ‘the catch’: Anyone
who decides to pose for a photograph will be confronted with a text printed on
the back side of each figure. The texts will provide some basic details about a
particular legal decision in which a woman’s dress was ‘ruled’ provocation for
a violent attack, as well as contact information about organizations working to
end violence against women and protect women’s rights. PROJECT BUDGET: 1,000 USD900 USD - 9 figures a@ 100 USD/figure50 USD - additional signage50 USD - Indiegogo % (admin fee) The costs of this exhibit are pretty straightforward. My personal expenses related to preparing and installing the exhibit are all mine, and I'm asking contributors to pay the very nominal costs of shipping for their own 'perks'. All that leaves is how much I'm going to have to pay the company that will be producing the actual figures and other materials that will be in the exhibit, as well as the administrative costs (i.e. the percent that goes to Indiegogo for hosting this campaign). Leaving room for differences between the estimates I've been given and how much I'll be charged for the actual production, as well as for fluctuations in the exchang rate between the dollar and the Turkish Lira (and the bank charge for currency exchange), I've estimated a nice round figure of 1,000 USD. THE OUTCOME 
I can't say to you, 'For your 20 dollar contribution you will get 1 less battered woman' (but wouldn't it be nice if I could?!). I suppose whether you decide to support 'The Ottoman Princess and Her Sisters' all hinges on whether or not you believe (like I do) that art can affect what we think, and that what we think can affect how we behave. (Or, if you are not 100% convinced about that, maybe one of the following perks will make you feel better...)

In addition to a financial contribution, you can help by sharing this campaign with your friends and inviting them to lend their support as well. (Remember: 'Like' is Good, 'Share' is Better.) You can also use the 
Ottoman Princess Facebook Page to share information about what's going on in your part of the world to put an end to violence against women and to help women who are victims of violence. 





Change has to start somewhere. Sometimes the best place to start is with a change in attitude. The 'Ottoman Princess' may not put a stop to violence against women overnight; but if it helps us to show a little more tolerance for each other - and stop seeing 'difference' as a 'provocation' - wouldn't that be nice?    




"" Değişim başlamalı bir yerde. Bazen en iyi başlangıç noktası davranışlarda değişikliğe gitmek. ""Osmanlı Prensesi"" kadına karşı şiddeti bir günde değiştiremez elbette ancak, birbirimize biraz daha müsamaha göstermemize faydası olacaksa- ve ""farklılıklarımızı"" ""tahrik""  olarak görmeyi bırakacaksak- güzel olmaz mıydı?


Merhaba. Adım Deborah. Aslen New Yorkluyum ama 20 yıldan fazla süredir
Türkiye’de yaşıyor ve uzun zamandır sanatla uğraşıyorum. Sanatımı insanları gezegenimizle
ve diğerleriyle olan ilişkilerini incelemeye teşvik etmek amacıyla yapıyorum. En sevdiğim şey birçok tekil parçalardan oluşturulan alan
kurguları yaratmak. Çoğu zaman çalışmalarımda dünyaya ”bakışımızda” sanatın
rolüne dair gizli bir anlam vardır. 
Sergilemeyi planladığım alan kurgusu çağdaş
Türk toplumunda kadına dair “Hoşgörü” temasını inceliyor. Hedefim bir yandan
kadına karşı şiddet konusunda bir bilinç oluştururken, aynı zamanda kendinden “
farklı “ olana karşı “anlayış” gösterme duygusunu teşvik etmek. 
Bunları neden yapıyorum? Sanırım sadece ötekini
biraz daha anlayabilsek, biraz daha iyi davransak, az daha sabırlı olsak
birbirimize daha az zarar verme olasılığı olduğunu düşündüğümdendir.
Ciddi bir konuyu ele aldığımdan dolayı, bu alan kurgusunu  insanları korkutup kaçırmaktan çok onların da
bir parçası olmasını sağlayacak şekilde bir “turistik çekim” noktası olarak
tasarladım (hatta örtüledim bile denilebilir).(“Ağır
konulara” girmeden önce sadece sanat eserinin kendisi hakkında detayları okumak
istiyorsanız, aşağıda “PROJE” kısmına atlayabilirsiniz ).

ARKA PLAN BİLGİ

“Bir Osmanlı Prensesi Gibi Fotoğraf Çektirin” adlı alan kurgusu fikrini ilk
kez internette Türkiye’nin İzmir şehrinde eşini öldürmekten mahkûm olan bir
adamın cezasında katledilen kadının “kot pantolon giyerek eşini tahrik ettiği”
nedeniyle indirime gidildiğine dair okuduğum bir habere tepki olarak
geliştirmiştim.
Benim için inanılmaz derecede sarsıcıydı bu – ve eminim sizin için de
öyledir – ancak, bunun bir seferliğine yapılan bir “hata” olmadığını öğrendim: Türk
mahkemesinin  “dekolte” kıyafetin kadının
katledilmesi için bir “tahrik” unsuru olduğu kararı vermesi olağandışı bir şey
değil. (Mahkemelerin tahrik unsuru olarak kabul ettikleri diğer şeyler arasında
“akşam yemeğinin hazırlanmaması” ve “boşanmak istemek” de var.)
Devletin bu konuda takındığı ilgisiz tavra bakıldığında, yakın zamanda
hazırlanan bir BM raporunda Türkiye’de kadınların %41,9’unun yaşamlarının bir
noktasında ev içi fiziksel ve cinsel şiddete maruz kaldığının ifade edilmesi
hiç de şaşırtıcı değil. 
Şüphesiz, kadına karşı şiddet sadece Türkiye ile sınırlı değildir; dünya
çapında kadınlara uygulanan şiddetin ne seviyede olduğuna dair tahmin (Dünya Sağlık
Örgütü’ne göre ev içi fiziksel/cinsel şiddet ile yabancı birisi tarafından
uygulanan cinsel şiddet de dâhil olmak üzere ) yüzde 30 olup; diğer bir deyişle
her 3 kadından 1 tanesi yaşamlarında fiziksel/cinsel şiddet mağduru olacaktır.
Hoşgörünün anahtarı
başkalarının duygularını anlamaktır. “Kendimize benzeyen insanların”
duygularını anlamak kolaydır ancak, 
farklı görünen insanlara karşı anlayış göstermek ve hoşgörülü olmak
biraz çaba gerektirecektir. “Osmanlı Prensesi” adlı alan kurgum insanların
kıyafet değiştirmek gibi kolay bir şekilde farklı kimlikleri denemesine izin
vererek, birer insan olarak düşündüğümüzden çok daha fazla ortak noktaları
paylaştığımızı görmeye yardımcı olmayı hedeflemektedir. 

Geçtiğimiz on yılda Türkiye’de kadınlar özellikle zor bir dönem geçirmişlerdir. Hükümet bir yandan demokrasi ve dini özgürlüğün lideri olarak algılanırken diğer yandan da laikliği erozyona uğratan otoriter, tam sınırda bir diktatörlük olarak algılanmaktadır,
Kadın kıyafetlerinden bir tanesi - başörtüsü - Türk toplumunda dinin ayrıştırıcı rolünün bir sembolü haline geldi. Bu durumu bir uçta Türkiye’de kadınların şu anda var olan özgürlüklerini kaybedecekleri Taliban tarzı bir teokrasiye doğru gidişatın işareti olarak görenler var iken, diğer uçta Türkiye’de  “açık”  kadınları Türk toplumu ve geleneksel değerlerinin Batı Yozlaşmışlığı tarafından tahrip edilmesinin işareti olarak görenler bulunmaktadır.  .
Aslına bakarsanız, benim bildiğim kadarıyla, ülkenin çoğu bu iki bakışın ortasında bir yerlerde durmaktadır. Ne yazık ki, inanılmaz derecede çeşitli yaşam biçimleri ve inançlarımıza karşılık, bu çeşitliliği tanımak ve onaylamaktaki isteksizlik kadınları kutuplaştırmakta ve kadını koruyup, haklarımızı garantiye almak açısından, ileri adım atma çabalarını bir anlamda engellemektedir.
PROJE


Have Your Picture Taken as an Ottoman Princess will be exhibited at the Bodrum Museum of Underwater Archaeology (‘The Bodrum Castle’) as part of the 2015 Bodrum Biennial from 12 September-12 November 2015. The installation will consist of nine life-sized figures of women, along with an old-fashioned photographer’s tripod and a sign reading “Have Your Picture Taken as an Ottoman Princess”.
""Osmanlı Prensesi Gibi Fotoğraf Çektirin"" adlı alan kurgusu, 12 Eylül-12 Kasım tarihler arasında 2. Bodrum Bienali kapsamında sergilenecektir. Bu çalışma, dokuz adet gerçek yaşam boyutunda kadın figürü ve eski model bir üçayaklı
fotoğraf sehpası yanı sıra “ Bir Osmanlı Prensesi Olarak Fotoğraf Çektirin”
yazan tabeladan oluşacak.""Prenses” imgesini 19. Yüzyıla ait bir gravür baskıdan uyarlıyorum. Diğer 8
tasvir içinse İstanbul ve Bodrumda çektiğim (ya da internetten “ödünç aldığım”)
kadın fotoğraflarını kullanıyorum ve şu anda bunları oryantalist  “Prenses” çizimi tarzında suluboya ve
mürekkep çizimlerine dönüştürmek üzere bilgisayarda eskizlerini hazırlıyorum. Burada
verilen eskizlerden de görebileceğiniz üzere, bu tasvirler “teşhir edilenden
katılana” kadar yelpazeyi kapsayacak ancak, ortak yönleri suluboya portre
hissini vermeleri olacak, çehresizlik - sans
visage.
Çizimler bittikten sonra, bunları bir tabela şirketine vereceğim (ki pahalı
olan kısmı budur) ve bana Forex tabela malzemesinden gerçek boyut tasvirler
hazırlayıp, yüz kısmını kesip çıkaracaklar ve dengede durabilmeleri için altına
metal kaide ekleyecekler.  Bu şekilde
sergilenen tasvirlere ziyaretçiler her tasvirdeki boşluğa başlarını koyup”
Osmanlı Prensesi” ya da günümüz Türkiye’sinde yaşayan sekiz kadın “tipi” olarak
kendi fotoğraflarını çekebilecekler. Bunlara ek olarak, “özçekim-selfie” için “poz veren” biri (fotoğrafçı
sehpası sadece bir aldatmacadır- insanlar kendi fotoğraflarını çekmek zorunda
kalacak) çektiği fotoğrafları Instagram ve “Osmanlı Prensesi” Facebook sayfasına
koyabilecektir.

Burada”yakalanmak” istenen nokta ise: Fotoğraf çekimi için poz vermeye
karar verenler her tasvirin arka kısmında asılı bir metinle karşılaşacak. Metinlerde
şiddet içeren bir saldırıya maruz kalmış olan kadının kıyafetinin tahrik olarak
kabul edildiği hukuki “karar” konusunda basit detaylar yanı sıra, kadına karşı şiddeti
ortadan kaldırmak ve kadın haklarını korumak amacıyla faaliyet gösteren
kuruluşların iletişim bilgileri bulunacaktır.  
Bu serginin masrafları aslen basit. Serginin hazırlanması ve alana
kurgulanması ile ilgili masraflar bana ait olup, katılımcılardan sadece kendilerine verilecek olan “hediyenin”  düşük nakliye
masrafını karşılamalarını istiyorum. Kalan ise tasvirleri üreten şirkete
ödenecek ücret ve Indiegogo “idari masraflar”.

PROJE Bütçesi: 1,000 USD
900 USD - 9 figures a@ 100 USD/figure
50 USD – diğer malzemeler
50 USD - Indiegogo % 

SONUÇ” Yapacağınız 20 dolarlık katkı ile  1 kadını daha fazla ezilmekten kurtaracaksınız”
( ne iyi olurdu değil mi ?) diyemeyeceğim. Sanırım “Osmanlı Prensesi ve Kız Kardeşlerini”
desteklemeye karar vermeniz ya da vermemeniz sanatın düşüncelerimizi etkileyip
etkilemeyeceğine ve düşüncelerimizin davranışlarımızı etkileyip
etkilemeyeceğine  (benim gibi) inanıp
inanmamanıza bağlı. (ya da,  bu konuda 100%  ikna olmamışsanız, belki de yukarıda yazdığımız
“perklerden“ (yani, resimdeki hediyelerden) birisi kendinizi daha iyi hissetmenizi sağlayacak…)

</div> <div> <h3>About People of Coloring</h3> <p></p>
<p>People of Coloring aims to promote multi-cultural visibility, awareness and acceptance to youth and adults through conscious coloring books. We address the need to start conversations about race, culture, ethnicity and gender identity earlier in life. As we enhance the dialogue of common and shared experiences among diverse peoples of color, we hope to dissect stereotypes and dissolve barriers by which society divides. By working with artists who create with and for the community, we capture the cultural and socio-political climates in the places and times we live. We might not solve the world's problems, but we may create more conscious kids of color. People of Coloring - it’s not a race.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>About The Program</h3>
<p>For the Kid's Pavilion at FPAC this year, People Of Coloring will provide children and adults with illustrations and booklets to practice Conscious Coloring. This activity encourages participants to engage with artistic expression, ask critical questions, share stories and spark important conversations centered on diversity and challenging social norms in every-day encounters. Families can come together in a safe and fun environment to share stories, color, and discuss topics invoked by the illustrations of this year's coloring book. People Of Coloring dedicates a Filipino Edition for this year's festival, which features illustrations and information provided by participating artists.</p>

The unparalleled collective work explores the deepest truths passed down through history about our human existence.  Humans and divine beings powerfully portray each of the twelve stages in the most awe-inspiring classical realism.  Furthermore, the partially curved frameless murals are animated and interactive -- giving the viewer the experience of being a part of the art, as opposed to simply being an observer.  An original sound score and narrated prose complete this powerful creative triumvirate that promises to make this one of the most sensational and revelatory events of our time.  </p><p>The mission of <b>The Messengers</b> is use media at its highest function -- which is to remind us of our human potential.   Furthermore, <b>The Messengers</b> is a timely humanitarian effort to generate substantial funds for the purpose of caring for the children of our world.</p><p></p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1269845/files/20150304221542-Quotes_01.gif?1425536142"" src="""" style=""""/></h3><p>Director Thomas Christian Wolfe has gained the alliance of some of the world's most outstanding artists, along with Emmy award-winning composers, and new-thought leaders -- whom have all joined together to produce this epic portrayal of The Human Odyssey at the museum-quality level with which it was conceived.

<p>As with any endeavor, this project is being created in stages.  This is the first of a series of four Indiegogo campaigns we’ve planned over the upcoming 12 months.  Our goal with this initial campaign is to get us into actual production after years of astute designing and planning that has finally brought us to the place of total assurance this vision is completely viable and realistic.</p>
<p>The costs are significant to create this altogether new art form.  Pre-production begins with extensive “storyboarding” of the twelve epic-scale murals.  This is followed immediately with designing costumes, hiring numerous professional models/actors, extensive green-screen and underwater photo shoots, and designing the background sceneries.  Post-production includes weeks of editing and preparing reference imagery, months of painting, and composing an original score, as well as composing the powerful prose that is to align with each of the twelve murals.</p>
<p>Every plateau we reach in contributions takes the project to the next level of production.  Below is a breakdown of what we will be able to achieve with each contribution milestone we reach from your generous support: </p>
<p><b>$100,000 plateau:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Storyboard all twelve animated murals</li>
<li>Create a prototype of one live animated mural</li>

<li>Create more of the fully functioning twelve animated murals</li>
<li>Create the “pilot” of the 12-part webisode series
     entitled: <i>“The Making of The
     Messengers Event”, </i>which will give our global community a
     behind-the-scenes viewing of the exciting stages of creating this epic event.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>$500,000 plateau:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Complete creation of remaining twelve animated murals</li>
<li>Create 5 more webisodes of the 12-part series of <i>“The Making of The Messengers Event”</i>.</li>
<li>Compose original sound score to align with 12 murals</li>
<li>Compose original prose to align with 12 murals</li>
</ul>
<p><b>$1,000,000 plateau:</b></p>

This activates all the associate production teams and individuals who will build the actual exhibit including the state-of-the-art unique projection system, curved screens, venue planning, marketing, promotion, and all further aspects of managing and producing the ""live"" experience.</span><br/></p>

</div>","The Messengers is a spectacular world-touring exhibit comprised of twelve epic-scale murals that reveal the essence of what renowned mythologist, Joseph Campbell coined as The Hero's Journey ... the basis of all story throughout time. The unparalleled collective work explores the deepest truths passed down through history about our human existence.  Humans and divine beings powerfully portray each of the twelve stages in the most awe-inspiring classical realism.  Furthermore, the partially curved frameless murals are animated and interactive -- giving the viewer the experience of being a part of the art, as opposed to simply being an observer.  An original sound score and narrated prose complete this powerful creative triumvirate that promises to make this one of the most sensational and revelatory events of our time.  The mission of The Messengers is use media at its highest function -- which is to remind us of our human potential.   Furthermore, The Messengers is a timely humanitarian effort to generate substantial funds for the purpose of caring for the children of our world.Director Thomas Christian Wolfe has gained the alliance of some of the world's most outstanding artists, along with Emmy award-winning composers, and new-thought leaders -- whom have all joined together to produce this epic portrayal of The Human Odyssey at the museum-quality level with which it was conceived. Having dedicated the past four years to developing this vision down to every last detail, the team reaches out now for the support of the global community to take this dream for humanity into full flight.  Your support on any level will be credited and honored for the lifetime of this world-touring event. Read further to discover more about this years-in-the-making unparalleled vision.Above video: A fuller ""overview"" of this epic event (4 minutes).                           :
Click the following link: To read Positive Impact Magazine's 6-page article on The Messengers Event (starting on page 21): http://issuu.com/positiveimpactmagazine/docs/volume_3-2?e=2938531/2621976IS THIS A FILM?The main aspect of the The Messengers is a twelve room exhibit, where each room houses an epic-scale mural that portrays one specific stage of the Human Odyssey. Visitors will tour the exhibit in a precise sequence.  However, a film about the making of this event, as well as a live performance of the original sound score serve as exciting additions to this world-touring expose.  IS THE THEME RELIGIOUS?No.  The theme is completely universal and generally avoids all correlation to any specific religion or ideology.  While the event will surely provoke inner contemplation and possible revelation, the director's intention is purely to strike the universal chord of being human.WHAT IS THE THEME AND SUBJECT OF THESE ARTWORKS?Angels powerfully interact with humans to dynamically portray each of the twelve stages of the Human Odyssey ... the essence of all story throughout human history.ARE ANGELS THE MAIN FOCUS OF THIS EXHIBIT'S ART?Angels are portrayed in the most glorious manner -- which may well invite coining this event as the most spectacular event of angels ever seen.  However, the sole purpose in using angels is strictly for what they represent as a universal archetype -- being reminders of our human virtues and divine essence.  As such, the humans portrayed in these powerful scenes would still be the chief focus in this art.WHY IS IT BEING CONSIDERED A NEW ART FORM?The Messengers event uses the familiar technology we find in art, film and games.  However, it's the way they are combined that makes it unprecedented.  As Assistant Director Jeff Bedrick says: ""It's like walking into a museum and seeing the paintings come alive.""WHAT IS THIS CAMPAIGN'S OBJECTIVE?Now that this vision has been developed down to every last detail the objective is to raise enough funds to carry the project into full production.  This first phase of production targets three main aspects: 1) Designing and story-boarding all twelve murals; 2) Creating one working prototype, 3) Building the new website and online store in HTML5.  With enough funding support the ""pilot"" of the 12-part webisode series of ""The Making of The Messengers Event"" will also be created.HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO TOTALLY PRODUCE THE FIRST EVENT?It should take anywhere from 18-24 months to premiere the first live event.IS THIS JUST A ONE-TIME EVENT?Commencing with the premiere event The Messengers is designed to continue touring thereafter, one major city at a time.WHERE IS THE FIRST EVENT SCHEDULED TO BE?The Messengers is slated to initially launch in the US ... specifically San Francisco, California.
HOW ARE THE EVENTS TIED IN WITH CHARITY?The world-touring exhibit is designed to make significant funds online, as well as at each of the tour points.  The objective has always been to use a significant amount of the profits to address the most pressing needs of our time ... especially our world's children.  There is an in depth plan already designed for this, which will be divulged in full detail to the global community at a near future point.Thomas Christian Wolfe's distinguished career spans over three decades with epic murals and paintings for such prestigious clients as The California Academy of Sciences, The Oakland Museum, Yellowstone Club World's Emerald Cay, Kenny Loggins, Dreamworks, Disney, Sony, and many others. His work has been described as classical, romantic, epic, visionary, universal, and unforgettable.Over the four years of developing this vision down to every last detail, Wolfe has had no trouble inspiring some of the world's most outstanding artists to join on his mission to use art for its highest purpose.
Our dream team is comprised of world-renowned artists, writers, musicians, and technical experts who have all received great esteem and admiration for their professional achievements in their assorted fields. This includes a roster of accomplished masters, each of whom have contributed their talents to productions that have collectively garnered Oscars, Emmys, Grammys, and earned billions of dollars worldwide. 


The Messengers is an ambitious endeavor. The designs and committed team are ready to go. However, significant production costs include video and lighting equipment and crew, model fees, studio space, marketing and promotion costs, website development, venue rental, printing, display construction, etc. We can only do this with a substantial working budget to meet these considerable costs. This is where you, as a part of the global community can step in to be a part of this noble cause by contributing whatever you can to help it launch.  Here is a list of our goals with this initial outreach to our global community:
Designing and Storyboarding all twelve murals
Creating one or more fully functioning protypes
Creating the all new exciting website in HTML5 (which will be accessible on all devices), including its online store.  This will be our ""eye"" to the global community -- which includes showcasing a series of twelve behind-the-scenes short films that will show the trials and triumphs of creating a global event.

As with any endeavor, this project is being created in stages.  This is the first of a series of four Indiegogo campaigns we’ve planned over the upcoming 12 months.  Our goal with this initial campaign is to get us into actual production after years of astute designing and planning that has finally brought us to the place of total assurance this vision is completely viable and realistic.
The costs are significant to create this altogether new art form.  Pre-production begins with extensive “storyboarding” of the twelve epic-scale murals.  This is followed immediately with designing costumes, hiring numerous professional models/actors, extensive green-screen and underwater photo shoots, and designing the background sceneries.  Post-production includes weeks of editing and preparing reference imagery, months of painting, and composing an original score, as well as composing the powerful prose that is to align with each of the twelve murals.
Every plateau we reach in contributions takes the project to the next level of production.  Below is a breakdown of what we will be able to achieve with each contribution milestone we reach from your generous support: 
$100,000 plateau:

Storyboard all twelve animated murals
Create a prototype of one live animated mural
Create a new website in HTML5 to cross all devices (in
     7 languages).

$250,000 plateau:

Create more of the fully functioning twelve animated murals
Create the “pilot” of the 12-part webisode series
     entitled: “The Making of The
     Messengers Event”, which will give our global community a
     behind-the-scenes viewing of the exciting stages of creating this epic event.

$500,000 plateau:

Complete creation of remaining twelve animated murals
Create 5 more webisodes of the 12-part series of “The Making of The Messengers Event”.
Compose original sound score to align with 12 murals
Compose original prose to align with 12 murals

$1,000,000 plateau:
This is what is needed to create all the content for this epic event! 

12 completely animated and interactive mural works
Produce the original sound score (recorded with live orchestra)
Produce all the original narration
Expand the new HTML5 website to all top world languages
Entire 12-part webisode series of “The Making of The Messengers Event”. 


Above and Beyond:
Producing the first “live” premiere event of The Messengers will require considerably more than the seed funding to create the content.  Once we have reached the plateau of creating all of the content for The Messengers, we will be ready to present to a panel of celebrity investors needed to build the infrastructure of the world-touring exhibit. This activates all the associate production teams and individuals who will build the actual exhibit including the state-of-the-art unique projection system, curved screens, venue planning, marketing, promotion, and all further aspects of managing and producing the ""live"" experience.

Throughout all of our Indiegogo campaigns, as well as on our official website, we will keep our subscribers and the global community updated on a daily basis as to our project’s progress.



The Messengers team sincerely wishes to thank everyone who has been so supportive from the very inception of this vision four years ago -- including all of our newest friends and supporters here, who can consider yourselves to be no less than executive producers of this unprecedented event.  AdobeBlack Cat StudioDell

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Arts for Mental Health:</h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Stop the Stigma</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Our Story: </h3>
<p>In the U.S. alone, there is one death by suicide every twelve minutes. As a statistic, this is an extremely troubling number. As someone who has been touched by this reality, it is even more devastating.</p>
<p>On July 7 of this year, my aunt Mary became one of those statistics. She graduated from Wesley Memorial School of Nursing at Loyola University (magna cum laude) and the University of California, San Francisco. She was a Nurse Practitioner. She was vibrant, intelligent, kind and generous. She enjoyed reading, gardening, music and art. Every twelve minutes, we lose someone just like Aunt Mary, my loved one who touched thousands of lives through her work and service. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Our Why:</h3>
<p>According to the CDC, 80-90% of people who seek treatment for depression are treated successfully using therapy and medication. But, so many people struggling with mental health issues do not seek help for a myriad of reasons, including some are too ashamed, some cannot afford it, and some feel they can’t be helped. There is still a stigma in today’s world surrounding mental health, and this stigma needs to end.</p>
<p>This is why we have created “Arts for Mental Health”. Beginning on January 3, 2020 we will record a song that was based on the thoughts and feelings that came as result of my aunt’s death. <strong>All proceeds from this campaign, plus future purchases, streams, and royalties of this song will be donated to two leaders in the mental health community: No Stigmas and the National Alliance on Mental Illness.</strong> Our goal is to support and raise as much money as possible towards this cause and helping those in need with this same crisis.</p>
<p>We want to make sure no one is denied help or shamed into feeling like seeking help is not an option, regardless of their means. Through the power of the arts and music, we want work towards a brighter future for those struggling with their own depression and mental health issues. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">How It Came Together:</h3>
<p>When I first had the idea for this campaign, I knew I wanted to use the arts and music to help others living with depression or mental health issues. This is not an epidemic that will go away or resolve itself, and something needs to be done. The suicide rate in the U.S. rose 24% from 2007 to 2017, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Among people ages 10 to 24 years old, it jumped 56%. </p>
<p>Mental illness and suicide are epidemics that affect so many, proving that even if someone has the means to get help, they don’t always do so. Knowing how much my aunt had been suffering in silence for so many years, and knowing how many others feel the same way, I felt I needed to do whatever I could to help as many people in similar situations as I could. I decided to use my own personal outlet and strength, music, to accomplish this. Music helped me cope with this loss, and I hope that by creating and performing this song, it can help others with their own battles, whether it is depression, coping with loss, or giving them the courage or means to seek treatment.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Song:</h3>
<p>The music portion for “Holding Pattern” has actually been completed since 2015. Though I never had any inspiration to write lyrics for the music until all the feelings surrounding my aunt’s death came flooding in and I knew I needed to get them out in a positive and healthy way. With the help of Tyler and Keaton, we finished the song and lyrics this past fall. The song portrays someone battling with depression and thoughts of suicide, something that we don’t see or hear often in the media or today’s music. It is so important for people to understand they are not alone in these thoughts and feelings and there are others who understand and are coping with the same. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Our Team:</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">To accomplish this, we have put together an amazing team of individuals:</p>
<p><strong>Me (Dan)</strong>: (Ridgeway Recording) I am a multiple award-winning producer, engineer, musician, and educator and I am also the creator and organizer behind this campaign. As stated above, this tragedy has made me want to do everything in my power to end the stigma around mental health issues. I will be producing, writing, playing and engineering the song.

<p>This is an extremely personal and meaningful project for me and my family, and I know so many others will feel the same. I want to thank everyone for their time and effort put toward this project and for the support my friends and family have given me through this process. I want to especially thank my mother, Ann, for her support and guidance during this difficult time. Losing her sister has been understandably difficult for her, but the help she has given me is unmatched even through that devastation. Please know that with your donation, you will not only be helping those struggling with depression and mental health issues, but also their families and loved ones. 90% of those who died by suicide in 2018 had a diagnosable mental health condition at the time of their deaths. There is help, and with your donation, we work towards a brighter future. We understand that not everyone will be able to make a monetary donation but please know that sharing this campaign with your friends and family is just as important.</p>

</div></div>","Arts for Mental Health:
Stop the Stigma
 
Our Story: 
In the U.S. alone, there is one death by suicide every twelve minutes. As a statistic, this is an extremely troubling number. As someone who has been touched by this reality, it is even more devastating.
On July 7 of this year, my aunt Mary became one of those statistics. She graduated from Wesley Memorial School of Nursing at Loyola University (magna cum laude) and the University of California, San Francisco. She was a Nurse Practitioner. She was vibrant, intelligent, kind and generous. She enjoyed reading, gardening, music and art. Every twelve minutes, we lose someone just like Aunt Mary, my loved one who touched thousands of lives through her work and service. 
 
Our Why:
According to the CDC, 80-90% of people who seek treatment for depression are treated successfully using therapy and medication. But, so many people struggling with mental health issues do not seek help for a myriad of reasons, including some are too ashamed, some cannot afford it, and some feel they can’t be helped. There is still a stigma in today’s world surrounding mental health, and this stigma needs to end.
This is why we have created “Arts for Mental Health”. Beginning on January 3, 2020 we will record a song that was based on the thoughts and feelings that came as result of my aunt’s death. All proceeds from this campaign, plus future purchases, streams, and royalties of this song will be donated to two leaders in the mental health community: No Stigmas and the National Alliance on Mental Illness. Our goal is to support and raise as much money as possible towards this cause and helping those in need with this same crisis.
We want to make sure no one is denied help or shamed into feeling like seeking help is not an option, regardless of their means. Through the power of the arts and music, we want work towards a brighter future for those struggling with their own depression and mental health issues. 
 
How It Came Together:
When I first had the idea for this campaign, I knew I wanted to use the arts and music to help others living with depression or mental health issues. This is not an epidemic that will go away or resolve itself, and something needs to be done. The suicide rate in the U.S. rose 24% from 2007 to 2017, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Among people ages 10 to 24 years old, it jumped 56%. 
Mental illness and suicide are epidemics that affect so many, proving that even if someone has the means to get help, they don’t always do so. Knowing how much my aunt had been suffering in silence for so many years, and knowing how many others feel the same way, I felt I needed to do whatever I could to help as many people in similar situations as I could. I decided to use my own personal outlet and strength, music, to accomplish this. Music helped me cope with this loss, and I hope that by creating and performing this song, it can help others with their own battles, whether it is depression, coping with loss, or giving them the courage or means to seek treatment.
 
The Song:
The music portion for “Holding Pattern” has actually been completed since 2015. Though I never had any inspiration to write lyrics for the music until all the feelings surrounding my aunt’s death came flooding in and I knew I needed to get them out in a positive and healthy way. With the help of Tyler and Keaton, we finished the song and lyrics this past fall. The song portrays someone battling with depression and thoughts of suicide, something that we don’t see or hear often in the media or today’s music. It is so important for people to understand they are not alone in these thoughts and feelings and there are others who understand and are coping with the same. 
 
Our Team:
To accomplish this, we have put together an amazing team of individuals:
Me (Dan): (Ridgeway Recording) I am a multiple award-winning producer, engineer, musician, and educator and I am also the creator and organizer behind this campaign. As stated above, this tragedy has made me want to do everything in my power to end the stigma around mental health issues. I will be producing, writing, playing and engineering the song. My donations include studio time, mixing time, pay, the website and associated fees, etc.
Kobi Swissa (Swissa Creative Inc.): Kobi has generously donated his time and expertise in videography and production this campaign. 
Marco Degadillo: Marco, along with Kobi, did all of our storyboarding, scripting, shot the footage for the campaign video and will be shooting footage during the recording process. He also was the director for our promotional video.
Jill L. Ferguson (jillferguson.com): Jill, a best-selling author, was key to our script editing and gave amazing advice and words of wisdom.
Diana Torres (egg-plantation.com): Diana has played a vital role in building our website.
Keaton Snyder: Keaton (formerly of The Dodos) is the music producer for the song being recorded.
 
Musicians: (Alphabetical order)
James Fixx: James (fixxmusic.com) assisted in engineering as well as playing keys and singing.
Andrew Green: Andrew (twintalkmusic.com) is the percussionist and drummer.
Sean Jacobi: Sean is the bass guitar player for Holding Pattern.
Ben Norsworthy: Ben is the guitar player, keyboard player, and background vocal. 
Tyler Warnygora: Tyler is the co-writer and singer for Holding Pattern. 
 
Where Your Money is Going:
-Making sure the musicians and producer are paid for their time
-Mastering the song
-Uploading fees for the song for distribution
-After these expenses are met, 100% of your donations will go towards our partner charities to help end the stigma of mental health issues.

<p>My name is Amritha and I am an environmental and transdisciplinary artist whose work includes painting, installation, performance and community engagement. </p>
<p>Through an initiative I have started called KalkiCreate (kalkicreate.com), I engage communities and school groups in collective projects that nurture our creativity in connection with the earth. Some projects I have done with students include making sound art with recycled materials and putting on a whole school musical performance, creating collage art out of repurposed materials, outdoor observation and drawing from life. The aim of these projects is for students to be empowered creatively and feel connected to their environment. </p>
<p>I seek to further this work through this funding campaign, which will allow me to develop and implement art and nature immersive projects with communities and schools. It will also afford me the opportunity to participate in two art residencies with the organization La Wayaka Current, where I will create art in remote regions of Central and South America, working with the indigenous communities there. </p>
<p>This opportunity will allow me to learn about and experience the remote, natural environments of the Atacama desert, Chile and Guna Yala, Panama, and to learn from the indigenous communities, the Lickan Antay and the Gunas. I will be able to create work in response to the environmental impacts these communities are facing and curate educational projects that raise awareness about these impacts. In supporting this campaign, you will help to further enrich my ability as an artist and educator working with the environment and in community.  </p>
<p>The funding I need is $15,000. This covers the cost of two residencies, the cost of airfare, of travel insurance, supplies, art supplies and living expenses. Each residency is three weeks long, where I will be immersed in the local cultures, learning about land conservation, sustainable practices, subsistence farming, archeology and botanic healing. All of the funds will go towards funding these two residencies and growing KalkiCreate into a fully operating entity. </p>
<p>In helping to fund this campaign, you are helping to further my work with KalkiCreate, supporting art that addresses environmental and social concerns, and helping to bring this work into communities and schools. You are also helping to support me as an emerging artist, the non-profit arts organization La Wayaka Current and the indigenous communities, the Lickan Antay and the Gunas, of the Atacama Desert and Guna Yala.  </p>
<p>If you are not able to contribute financially, you can help by sharing this campaign with others and anyone you know who may be interested in supporting. Thank you so much for your time and for your support! </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I have been photographing the human body for the past 30 years. Much of my work originates from my mental approach to image production—from the myriad paintings I produce, textures I create, and photographs I take. The resulting images include allusions to the material by which the models are absorbed or into which they disappear.</p>
<p>I find contentment with the use of more than the single image. With the combination of multitude images, my work strives to present the incongruous dualities of beauty and ugliness, change and transformation, dream and reality, human and nature. The power of mythology in our complex universe fascinates me and in many ways my work is simply trying to make sense of our own existence, from life to death.</p>
<p>This will be my ninth book, but the first comprehensive retrospective of all my work to date!</p>
<p>I’ve created all kinds of incentives, from small to big—signed books and prints of images from the book, limited edition unique folios, and even photo session in my studio.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">****Please note the book will not be shipped until March 2018***</p>
<p>Your contribution will help showcasing John Bernhard’s work to a broader and creatively informed audience, keeping the journey moving forward and continue the dream.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
I have been photographing the human body for the past 30 years. Much of my work originates from my mental approach to image production—from the myriad paintings I produce, textures I create, and photographs I take. The resulting images include allusions to the material by which the models are absorbed or into which they disappear.
I find contentment with the use of more than the single image. With the combination of multitude images, my work strives to present the incongruous dualities of beauty and ugliness, change and transformation, dream and reality, human and nature. The power of mythology in our complex universe fascinates me and in many ways my work is simply trying to make sense of our own existence, from life to death.
This will be my ninth book, but the first comprehensive retrospective of all my work to date!
I’ve created all kinds of incentives, from small to big—signed books and prints of images from the book, limited edition unique folios, and even photo session in my studio.
****Please note the book will not be shipped until March 2018***
Your contribution will help showcasing John Bernhard’s work to a broader and creatively informed audience, keeping the journey moving forward and continue the dream.

<li>to reach out and give support to people who are
     questioning their gender or beginning their journey</li>
<li>to support and educate families and friends of
     trans people</li>

help to fund an exciting, ground breaking project that could reach out to
thousands of people in need of support.</span></p>
<p><b>Where
your donations will go: </b>Funds are needed primarily for computer
software to put the animation's audio and visual elements together. In addition
to this, donations will cover the cost of hiring musicians to write and record
original music, and voice actors.<br/>
Also needed is, of course, the huge amount of paper, scissors, glue, pens, ink,
spray paint, tweezers, wire, tape, paint brushes, etc, that will go in to
producing over 40,000 handmade frames of animation!<br/>
Funds also will go to the production of DVDs and the cost of sending these out
to LGBTQ charities and support groups. <br/>
If the campaign doesn't reach its full financial target, any funds raised will
still go towards the production of the film.</p>
<p><b>What
you get: </b>Perks range from a big thank you,
through one off pieces of art, and on to me coming to your house and using my
many years of chef experience to cook a three course meal for you and a
couple of your mates!<br/>
See the perks list on the right for full details.</p>
<p>Everyone
who donates will be mentioned in the credits of the film!</p>
<p><b>Why
I am making this film: </b>When I began to question my gender in my teens, there
were no resources available to me. I didn't even know what 'transgender' meant
until I realised I was transgender myself. As a result of this, I was left
feeling depressed, scared, and like there was something really wrong with me.
If the availability of this film can make other people aware that they are not
alone and that there are other people like them, that will be a wonderful
thing.</p>
<p>There
is still so much prejudice and
ignorance surrounding gender change. The progression of gay rights is fantastic,

head the role of Art Director for the space. Towards the end of 2010, the space  became primarily focused on the gallery
aspect of Odessa, allowing Bailey to be the lead conductor of the alternative
organization, with the help of her better half: Adam
Gilreath.  The creative couple knew
first-hand the need for such an open and non-discriminative space in Memphis,
away from the mainstream establishments that had become so
institutionalized.  In the last 12
months, Odessa has established itself as an essential member of the Memphis
arts community and is a vital component to the continued revitalization and
rebirth of the Broad Avenue Arts District. Odessa was recognized with a grant
from the Tennessee Arts Commission (via ArtsMemphis’ Arts Build Communities
program) to commission a new mural on the side of our building.
 
Odessa
produces approximately three one-night shows per month, each of which draw
upwards of forty attendees. These shows include group and solo art exhibitions,
installations, one-time-only shopping opportunities, movie screenings, and
musical showcases. Our intent is to cultivate an atmosphere that will provide
new opportunities for connecting and networking artists at all stages of their
careers.  
 
Odessa
believes that our creative community must have a regular outlet to foster
inspiration and productive dialog with the larger community.  Therefore, we purposefully program
events as often as possible to continuously create an inviting and encouraging
environment for the benefit of artists and the public alike.
 
With
the proper support, Odessa has the vision and ability to play a significant
role in shaping the future of Memphis’ arts community. Specifically: 
 
1.
Based on a successful year of programming and community-building, we believe
that we can expand our efforts and grow as an organization – which includes
diversifying our revenue streams beyond artists’ gallery fees.  Over the last year, we have only been
able to have single-night showings of each artist’s work, although we hope to
sustain a more regular gallery program with longer showings as well as regular
gallery hours. 
 
2.
We want to partner with public schools and non-profit organizations that focus
specifically on reaching out to our community’s youth to provide free gallery
exhibition opportunities to an even younger generation of emerging Memphis
artists.
 
However,
we cannot accomplish these objectives, nor sustain our commitment to our
mission of supportive emerging Memphis artists, without help from our
community. In order for Odessa to evolve while still providing our unique and
supportive environment for future generations of Memphis artists, we must have
the resources to focus on them – not our month-to-month overhead expenses.  Your contributions to our mission will
preserve an essential, arts-oriented anchor in a quickly developing urban
neighborhood while supporting a larger segment of Memphis’ creative class at
the same time. 
 
HOW YOU CAN HELP!
Currently, Odessa needs to raise enough money to sustain our organization for the remaining months of May, June, and July to ensure that the shows that have been already scheduled can proceed. Our expenses each month are as follows:




$800 for rent 


$150-$200 for utilities


$150 for cleaning supplies, toiletries, paint, spackle, and hanging supplies (gallery essentials)




This brings our total monthly expenses to $1,150.00. 

Odessa, as stated earlier, has an average of three shows per month, with a gallery rental fee of $100.00 per show.  This brings in a revenue of  roughly $300.00, which is substantially less than our monthly expenses.  Why not raise the rental fee? That is because Odessa aims to be an affordable space for emerging, and often 'starving', artists that cannot afford the space rental most other galleries charge.
With enough regular funding, we would be able to eliminate this fee all together, allowing these artists to have this experience for free. 

Please
consider becoming one of our supporters, because your help is greatly needed right
now.  Your contribution will help pay our monthly rent and utilities while allowing us to expand our
regular programming and share more of our artists’ work with a larger audience.  You will be guaranteeing a home for
experimental and ambitious creative expression in Memphis that quite literally
has nowhere else to go in our city. 
While our surrounding neighborhood continues to evolve and diversify
every week, securing a venue where ambitious art can thrive is more and more
vital.
 
Odessa fills this
need. We exist to support artists in Memphis, and we hope you will join us in
that mission.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h2><strong>This June, three intrepid theater artists/performers from Brooklyn, Drae Campbell, Justine Williams and Eugene Ma, travel to Budapest to present an original performance piece and video work at <a href=""http://www.artsho.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ARTSHO</a>, <em>a nomadic pop-up art fest.</em></strong></h2>
<h3><strong>WHAT'S ARTSHO ALL ABOUT?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>ARTSHO</strong> is an international community of artists and art enthusiasts, culture-makers and social change workers who come together each year to exchange art and ideas and to leverage the power of art, ideas and community towards a worthy cause. This year marks the fourth annual event in Budapest, after previous shows in Berlin, London and New York, where the artistic enterprise began. Every year, artists from around the world create original pieces of art inspired by <strong>ARTSHO</strong>'s rotating theme. This year's theme, <em>ACADEMIE</em>, asks each artist to use their artistic medium to teach the <strong>ARTSHO </strong>community about something they care about or know about through their piece. A group of 30-40 local and international artists (along with even more art enthusiasts and the general public) come together for three days of art appreciating, making, sharing, meals, celebrations and arts-based activities all focused on the intersection of Art and Knowledge. </p>
<h3><strong>WHAT ARE YOU COOKING UP FOR ARTSHO?</strong></h3>
<p>We were invited to be the first live performance to present at this unique international, interdisciplinary art event! Our performances throughout the fest will create opportunities for ARTSHO participants and audiences to come together and celebrate the immediacy of the live theatrical event. We also plan to leave behind a video-based work of art for the auction. </p>
<p>We have the talent, the experience, the sparkling charisma and the drive to create a magical performance for this unique artist-powered, community-building event! We are already hard at work, creating a generous, hilarious, thought-provoking and completely ridiculous performance that uses live performance, video, powerpoint and original music to address the theme of <em>ACADEMIE</em> -- playfully, irreverently poking fun at the human drive to pretend that we know it all and the poetic and comic potential that arises when we admit we don't have a clue.</p>
<h3><strong>WHO ARE WE?</strong></h3>
<p>Justine Williams is an interdisciplinary artist crossing boundaries between theater, film, clown, music and community-based art. She has performed on stages regionally in the US and internationally, worked in short and feature length films as an actor, writer and/or producer, sung in bands and she regularly teaches courses in Play and Clown for fancy MFA programs, theater companies and for extraordinary everyday folk. She is a world traveler who loves collaborating and creating art with others in international contexts.</p>
<p>Drae Campbell is a writer, actor, director, storyteller, dancer, and nightlife emcee. In addition to winning the 2011 Miss LEZ title, Drae has been featured on Late Night with Conan O'Brien and on stages all over NYC. Her directing work has been featured in Iceland, NYC and in the San Francisco Fringe Festival. The short film she wrote and starred in, YOU MOVE ME has screened in festivals all over the world. YOU MOVE ME won the Audience Award for Outstanding Narrative Short at OUTFEST 2010. Drae was dubbed ""the next lezzie comedian on the block"" by AfterEllen.com for her comedic YouTube videos and her short film.</p>
<p>Eugene Ma is a NY-based, Hong Kong-raised, Chinese-Canadian theatre director, performer and musician. Recent directing credits include Moliere’s the Hypochondriac, Mark Ravenhill’s pool (no water), Thornton Wilder’s Childhood, and Saviana Stanescu’s Aurolac Blues. As a performer, his work has been seen on the stages of La MaMa E.T.C., St. Mark’s Church, Joe’s Pub/The Public, Mabou Mines, Ohio Theater and the Stone. Eugene is currently pursuing a teaching apprenticeship in physical comedy with comic master Christopher Bayes at the Juilliard School and Yale School of Drama, where he was guest music director for the third year actors' Commedia show, All Which Way And That.

<p>A few years back, looking for a fun Christmas gift for my girlfriend, I decided to write her a story.  More than just a storybook, I went to some very talented photographer friends of mine and asked if they’d be willing to take a shot at creating images for the story.  I thought the best reaction would be to mail them.  The response was awesome: she loved getting them and enjoyed the experience of getting them via the mail.  So a few years later we did it again. We did it for some of our friends (new story, new images) and it went over like crazy.  The response was great, and it only made us want to do it again. </p>
<p>So here we are.  That idea of writing a story and breaking it up over several postcards, postcards created exclusively for those story pieces.  I wanted to make it bigger, so this time I went to a larger group of artists I know to take on the cards.  This time, instead of two photographers, we have eight various artists, from across Canada.  I wrote the story again, and each artist chose two cards and did their magic entirely based on the words alone, no involvement from me beyond the actual story.  Any images I had in my head were only there via the story.  The actual design was all their creative voices.  Each postcard came out way beyond my expectations.  I can’t wait for you to see them. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>THE HEART</strong></p>
<p>At the heart of this project is one simple idea: who doesn’t love getting mail?  Every day we go to our mailboxes and pull out bills and junk mail, stuff that doesn’t hold anything for us, nothing that speaks to who we are or what we want the world to show us.  And then on those rare days, on special occasions and random mornings, we open that same mailbox and in the midst of the other stuff there is something special: a letter from a loved one, a postcard from abroad, a piece of artwork that speaks to your soul, a package uniquely yours.  When we know those things are coming, the anticipation of those artifacts makes the mailbox something special.  When those postcards come to your door, they will be yours, for you, and will hopefully make you feel the same way we did when we made them, and when we drop them in our mailbox to send them out to you.  Something special, made for you, shared across the world and connected by our mailboxes. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>THE MIND AND THE SOUL</strong> </p>
<p>There is a triangle for this to work: myself and the artists making the postcards, the lovely people of the postal service, and you; and you get the best job of them all.  You get the magic of getting them in the mail.  You get to consume this art, at random intervals, at your own schedule, as the postal service delivers. </p>
<p>We set for ourselves a high bar to start, 100 sets of this series of postcards.  The cost of printing and mailing these sets out is high, not to mention the cost of the artists’ time and materials.  Our goal is to find 100 people who want to a part in our little art project. </p>
<p>We’ve created some unique levels of support for you.  At the minimum, if you just want the set, there is that option available, however if you like the idea and want to go further down the mailbox with us, there are many other possibilities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>◦                     <strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">$2.  One Card, One Story</span></em></strong></p>
<p>Thank you!  And as thanks we will select one card randomly from the set and mail that to you with a note of thanks from the author. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>◦                     <strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">$35.  The Postcard Set</span></em></strong></p>
<p>The postcard set.  Once the set is completed and printed, we will begin mailing as soon as possible.  We will send out the cards to you one at a time as the project is intended.  If you’d prefer to get them whole as one mailing the whole set, we will accommodate.  Any cards that get wrecked or lost in transit, we will replace.  Each card is a stand-alone story, but they are all connected and we wouldn’t want you to miss out. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>◦                     <strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">$75.  The Postcard Book</span></em></strong></p>
<p>The postcard book is a collection of the plates made for the postcards to be printed.  Each page would be dedicated to the image of the card, in postcard size.  The opposing page would be the story that accompanies that image.  Each book will have a personal note from the author thanking you for your support.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>◦                     <strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">$100.  Combo Pack</span></em></strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>You want the postcards, but the book would be cool, how do you decide?  Easy: take them both.  Supporters wanting both options can get it here, and we’ll make you a deal on them.  The best deal of them all!</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>◦                     <strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">$150.  The Postcard Book – Special Edition</span></em></strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The postcard book is a collection of the plates made for the postcards to be printed.  Each page would be dedicated to the image of the card, in postcard size.  The opposing page would be the story that accompanies that image.  Each book will have a personal note from the author thanking you for your support.  </p>
<p>But wait, there’s more! (I cannot believe I typed that…)  Above and beyond the note of thanks from the author, we will get each artist to sign their respective pages.  And with the difficulty of getting all of the artists to sign these, with them all spread across the country, these special editions will be limited to only 10 copies. </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>◦                     <strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">$250.  The Artist’s Image</span></em></strong></p>
<p>Supporters at this level will receive the postcard set.  Once they’ve received them, they will be able to select the postcard of their choice to be printed as a stretched canvas piece (16”x20”) with an accompanying title card that will have the story on it.  The prints will be artist signed and the author will sign the title card.  A great artistic piece for your home!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>THE VOICE</strong></p>
<p>We thank you very much for your time and consideration of our art project.  If you are interested in supporting this project and getting involved, we can’t wait to get to know you.  If you can’t contribute, but still wish to help, please let as many people as you can know about it.  We’d love to spread this art project as far abroad as possible, and any help you can offer to spread the word will also be greatly appreciated.  </p>
<p>Feel free to fire me any questions and we will answer them all in a timely fashion and fill you in on all the ongoings of this very unique project.  The work of these artists is spectacular and it would be a shame for you not to see them. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Two years ago, my mother passed away. A friend of mine who had lost his parents told me that when your parent’s die, it makes you want to be a better person. And he was right.</p>
<p>I have worked harder in the past two years than perhaps is all my life to fill the void of losing the one person who could always talk me out of depression. When I was hospitalized with a severe drug reaction referred to as TEN, in 2001, my mother visited me every day in the Burn Unit of Sunnybrook Hospital.  And when the symptoms of Lupus began to appear, she took me in and protected me from the struggles of the world. She encouraged me to return to school, which I did. A challenge for a person who had been in a drug induced coma for two months and had her skin removed and re-grown. I also had numerous operations including two tracheotomies. I had to learn to walk again, to breathe again. I have lost my hair several times either due to Lupus of the medications I take and I struggle to survive.</p>
<p>When Mom was diagnosed with cancer, I moved in with her until it was time to place her in palliative care. I visited her each day as she had done for me, commuting two hours each way from my new job to her home in a suburb of Toronto and then to palliative care.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was the stresses of caring for her, working full-time and commuting that lead to my recent hospital stay. I have struggled to live with Lupus since I was diagnosed in 2004. I work hard to manage the pain. The illness presents as joint swelling, rashes, organ failure, anxiety and bone deterioration when it is active. I often wonder how much longer I have to live, but try not to think about it.</p>
<p>My father has Parkinson’s disease and diabetes. And after my Mother died, the family unit just fell apart.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Simone Frank was born in Toronto in 1970 and resided in Mississauga until she attended Ryerson University. There, she achieved a Bachelor of Applied Arts in Fashion Design in 1993. She is a Dean’s list graduate of Graphic Design from George Brown College in 2009. She also holds a certificate from writing from Humber College, 2003.
She has been exhibiting since 1991 in solo and group exhibitions in Toronto, the GTA, Tokyo and also in St. Vincent, W.I. where her family is from. Recently, she was invited to exhibit her works of art in China.
In St. Vincent she had three solo exhibitions at Lambii’s Yatch Club on Union Island and Singer Gallery in Kingstown, St. Vincent. She has had solo exhibitions at Singer Fragipani Hotel in Bequai, which is owned and operated by the Prime Minister’s daughter. She was interviewed twice on the radio while there. In Toronto she exhibited at Toronto City Hall. Her gallery solo exhibitions were at BAND, Skeir Gallery, Artist Awake and A Space Windows. She exhibited at Toronto City Hall. Her work is part of the Chinese Canadian Business Association’s collection in Toronto.
In July, 2000, she suffered a near-fatal allergy which lead to a three month hospital stay in intensive care. She also lives with Lupus, a chronic illness that affects the immune system.
She has received a Toronto Arts Council Exhibition Assistance grant in 1994 and 1997 and the Ontario Arts Council Writer’s Reserve grant in 1997.
Simone Frank taught private art classes from her studio called Soul Designs for several years until she taught for the Toronto Board of Education’s ACE Program in 1988. That year she was also published in Litté Realité, then later in Word Magazine 2002 and Anonymous Cheese in 2006, which was published by the Mississauga Arts Council.
She resides in Toronto, Canada.
Simone Frank needs financial assistance so that she can travel to Asia to exhibit her works of art.

<p>UPDATE!!  I will bring this sculpture to Burning Man to share it with the citizens of Black Rock City, before installing it at the museum!  Please help me make this happen -- let's bring this dream into reality!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hello, and thanks for visiting my FertiliTree Campaign, to create a 15' sculpture for the American Museum of Ceramic Art in Pomona!  This is our second Indiegogo campaign for this project (thus ""FertiliTree 2""), and now with AMOCA's full backing we're sure to get the support needed to make this happen!.</p>
<p>I've been a sculptor for about 7 years now.  I worked in the corporate world for 15 years in Industrial Design  until I quit that in ‘04 to devote myself to art.  First I traveled through Thailand and India for a year, studying meditation and yoga, and filling my creative spirit with inspiration from all the ancient art and architecture.  I returned with a desire to express fundamental truths about our human nature through my artworks.  The FertiliTree will be my greatest expression of this to date.</p>
<p>Usually people wait until their campaign is complete before beginning the project, but I will be building this sculpture while the campaign is running, and will have it completed and ready for installation by the end.  I'll be documenting the whole process, both the fundraising and the construction, to lay a roadmap for other artists to follow in creating their own monumental public art pieces!</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/869682/pictures/full/20130613152402-FertiliTree_2_openingimage.jpg?1371162248"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div>
<div class=""full-description""> </div>
<div class=""full-description"">The FertiliTree will be planted near the entrance of the museum’s new location in Pomona, just east of Los Angeles.   Pomona is the Roman goddess of fruit trees, of abundance, fruitfulness, and fertility, and so I used these themes to guide the design of the sculpture.  FertiliTree has no branches and leaves, but she’ll bear fruits of inspiration, wonder, and pleasure in the hearts of all who see her! </div>
<div class=""full-description""> </div>
<div class=""full-description"">The sculpture grows upwards from a tree trunk into a female form (I still need to work on the trunk shape a bit.)  She's holding a mandala blossom pattern, representing consciousness.  This piece expresses the fertile evolution and flow of Life, upwards from inanimate vegetation, through animals, and into humans, through which conscious self-awareness arises, so that the Universe may know Itself, through us.</div>

<p>The model of the piece shown above is a rough computer sketch– the final sculpture will have far more detail, color, and nuanced expression, like the Seeds have, and my Labradorite Priestess below</p>

<p>The FertiliTree will be by far the largest and most ambitious project I've attempted.   Not only will it be a great step for my artistic path as a wonderful addition to the museums collection and to the city of Pomona, but it also has the potential to make a huge difference in the world, as a model for community-based funding of public art pieces, combined with a very economic fabrication method! </p>
<p>Public art makes a place feel loved and cared for, transforming the cities we live in from primarily functional, utilitarian spaces to places of genuine beauty, inspiration, and joy, which the world could sure use a lot more of! </p>
<p>Up until now almost all public art has been created thru a very top-down approach, with some large organization providing the funds and the location for a public artwork.  If we can successfully decouple the funding from the location, this can blow open the doors to the manifestation of a lot more art in our cities, institutions, and our lives.</p>
<p>For public works, I've developed a unique process of filling the ceramic sections with concrete when the piece is installed, making it extremely strong and resilient. This overcomes the issue of fragility that has kept ceramics from being more widely employed in public art.  With this method we can eventually build sculptures 25-50-100 ft. tall, for a fraction of the cost of other public art fabrication methods. </p>
<p>They can be elaborately sculpted in a 3D modelling program, giving a very wide range of creative expressions.  Plus, the available glazes offer an extraordinary range of color possibilities, far more and far more durable than classic public art surface treatments.</p>
<p>Antoni Gaudi used ceramic elements and mosaics in his construction of Parc Guell and many other buildings in Barcelona 100 years ago, which are just as beautiful today as they were when they were first made, demonstrating the environmental resilience of glazed surfaces.  This new method I’ve developed, of filling hollow ceramic forms with concrete, can be much more versatile,  economical, and swift, since the form for the concrete is the ceramic itself!</p>

The Fleisher Art Memorial will host the 7th Annual ARTspiration!Community Arts Festival on Saturday, June 8, 2013.  This beloved, free street fair has provided an accessible entryway into the arts for Philadelphians who are not familiar with Fleisher’s programs or art-making in general.  ARTspiration! showcases Fleisher’s studio art classes, exhibitions and community programs while celebrating South Philadelphia’s rich cultural resources. Through art, this multicultural, intergenerational event brings together the diverse communities of Fleisher’s surrounding neighborhood.

<h3>About Our Campaign</h3>
<p>My name is Lauren Goodwin and I am the owner of a recently established portrait photography business called Rhino Photography. I am also the house photographer for Asylum 13, a weekly goth/industrial event run in Northern Delaware, which provides a kink friendly environment for those involved in and those who are curious about exploring alternative lifestyles; in which they can come together in a safe place and meet like-minded individuals.</p>
<p>The lifestyle promoted at Asylum 13 has recently been introduced to mainstream society, and not in a positive light. A harsh portrayal of women permeates this view, brought about by a judgmental media and recent popular fads that inaccurately portray alternative lifestyles, such as the novel _Fifty Shades of Grey_. I wish to show people a more positive (and accurate) view of this world, one in which women, no matter what their role, are shown as the healthy, strong and beautiful creatures that they are.</p>
<p>Therefore, we bring you the Women of Asylum 13 Calendar, an expressive collection devoted showing the women in this lifestyle at their best and most beautiful. Thank you for your support.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are raising funds in the amount of $4,000 to print an initial run of 100 calendars as well as upgrade my extremely old, out of date digital SLR camera body in order to create the quality of images this work deserves.</p>
<ul>
<li>$2,199 for camera body</li>
<li>$1,000 for first run of 100 full color, glossy calendars</li>
<li>$800 for models, hair, makeup, wardrobe</li>
</ul>
<p>Every dollar helps so please don't feel any contribution is too small. We are offering many perks ranging from hugs all the way to a portrait photo session by yours truly. We understand what we are creating is not for everyone, which is why I am offering alternate rewards in the way of gift certificates and photo shoots of your choice.</p>
<p>Even if we don't reach our goal, your contribution will be used towards this project even if it takes longer than our desired goal.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With your help, we can combat the negative mainstream view of the lifestyle we find so open-minded and full of love and support. </p>
<p>Your contribution is also crucial in helping my business get off the ground and fulfilling my life long dream of turning my hobby into a sustainable, sucessful career. Please help me save my soul. </p>

<p>The Walk of Art Kids project represents an arts and educational component, of the Walk of Art Inc. organization, that through liaisons with community organizations and local schools, provide a first rate, hands on arts education experience for children.

What this means? A renewed editorial focus, international expansion, a paid circulation and an entirely revisited format. The thing is, together with our dreams of world domination comes a very real need to fund the revolution. And what better way to buff the coffers up than by calling upon our loyal army of Word warriors (you!) for dollar-dollar-bill donations.
So, staying within the times, we’ve put together a month-long crowd-funding campaign with the objective of raising $27,000. How do we hope to hit the target? Well, we’ve concocted a range of different “support packages” in return for your humble donations. Starting at $6 and going up to $1,400, you’ll be able to get everything from your name printed in our next edition and a copy of our never-seen-before dummy issue to yearly subscriptions to the magazine and a framed and signed 70 x 120 print of your favourite Word cover ever. What’s more, we also will be introducing exclusive and limited “pop-up packages” during the campaign with gifts from our friends and family (a signed out-of-print Dirk Braeckman book, a commission with Sarah Eechaut, records from Dandelion Lotus Records and On-Point Records and much more), just to keep you on your toes.
Yes, this is us asking for money. But this is also your cue to show us some love and ensure we can give The Word Magazine the resources needed to go global. Fear not though, we’re still big on the smaller things in life, still dedicated to spotting and supporting creative and artistic talent and still intent on giving unique people, places and passions a voice. The only difference is that we’re going for a wider and tighter playing field.
The packages



The Like Level ($40)
Our first edition of 2013 delivered wherever you are in the world. A limited-edition pack of 10 The Word stickers + Your name printed in the first edition as a patron of The Word.



The love Level ($70)
A yearly subscription to The Word in 2013 (two editions). A limited-edition pack of 10 The Word stickers + Your name printed in the first edition as a patron of The Word.



The Live Level ($200)
A copy of our hand-numbered photobook. An unpublished copy of our dummy issue. A yearly subscription to The Word in 2013 (two editions). A limited-edition pack of 10 The Word stickers + Your name printed in the first edition as a patron of The Word.





The Photography Bundle ($250)
Clockwise from top left: A yearly subscription (2 issues) to the magazine, the chance to commission Word photographer Sarah Eechaut for a portrait of your choice, an autographed copy of Dirk Braeckman's out-of-print book, as well as signed, first-print artist editions culled from Le Caillou Bleu's archive.



The Limited Level ($650)
A signed and numbered 50x70 unframed print of our first edition’s cover. A copy of our hand-numbered photobook. An unpublished copy of our dummy issue. A yearly subscription to The Word in 2013 (two editions). A limited-edition pack of 10 The Word stickers + Your name printed in the first edition as a patron of The Word.



 Going international
As off April 2013, the magazine will be available in all major European cities (Paris, London, Amsterdam, Berlin, Rome, Milan, Barcelona, etc.) as well as in the United States (New York and Los Angeles) and Asia (Tokyo, Hong Kong, Seoul and Shanghai). You’ll be able to pick a copy up at specialist newssagents and bookstores, museum and gallery shops, concept stores and selected record stores.

 Free is dead
Instead of bending over backwards for advertisers, we much prefer doing so for our readers. Yes, that means you’ll now need to pay for a magazine some of you have been used to receiving for free for the past five years but, believe us, we’ll give you good reasons to.

 Two new sections
If you also read us online you’ll have noticed that photography and the arts have grown to become ever more important to our editorial mix. This, we felt, deserved to be set in stone with the addition of two dedicated sections. Unearthing the underbelly of photography and the arts, we’ll document the art forms themselves just as much as we will the people behind them. About, for and by the people if you will.

 Two editions per year
In a world where everything moves so quickly and a story becomes irrelevant the minute the “publish” button is hit, we’ll be slowing things down a notch in 2013. Two editions instead of five, giving ourselves more time to handcraft the kind of stories and features that deserve to be printed. The first edition will come out in April 2013, and the second one will hit newsstands come October.

 New format and design
We couldn’t possibly tighten the magazine’s editorial purpose, export it internationally and put it on sale without giving its design a complete make-over: a new format (slightly smaller), a new paper and a new design.
What’s next?
A bunch of stuff! First, we’ll be celebrating our fifth anniversary with a small do on 22nd February. We’ll also be launching, on the same night, a hand-numbered photo book which captures five years of Word photography. Then it’s back to work to get our Second Best Edition to the printers in time for its official release on 8th April.

Boys and Girls! Children of all Ages!Welcome to the ""Mad Scientist Lab"" Acquisition Drive!My name is Doctor Soul and I am an artist attempting to work in multiple fields, trying to see what wonderful and whimsical things I can create!The majority of my past work has been predominately computer based; I chose this because it allowed me to create without the restraints of cost being involved but it has one major limitation: it's not physical. Being the lover of making things that other people can enjoy I am attempting to expand my workspace so I have the ability to make more unique products. The type of things I am working on, outside of the incentives provided here, are as follows:

Prop Replicas, Jewelry, Costumes, Masks, 2D Artwork, Animations, Figures, Health Improvement Formulas, and More!
Seems like an odd list, but each item has a plan laid out! By supporting this project you will be assisting in providing a space to allow all the above to be created! 

PERKS!-- ""I Support Mad Scientist!""  Vinyl Decals!  I have a vinyl plotter and make these myself; it's one of the many enjoyable things I can do! 


A Decal will be included with each order of $15 or more! 
-- Glow-in-the-Dark ""TGRI"" PendantIf you know those initials, you know what these are fashioned after! I use a very high percentage of the most powerful Glow-in-the-Dark Powder: Alkaline Rare Earth Metal Silicate-Aluminate Oxide Europium Doped! It has a Very Long (24+ hours) Glow in the Dark effect! -- TGRI Pendants body measure 1.5 inches tall (1.65"" ttl) -- LE Chrysalis Pendant Each Chrysalis Resin Pendant color will be limited to a production of 100 each! Series 1 contains the following colors- Glow in the Dark (Blind Bags Only!)- Orange- White- Blue- Purple- Pink- Yellow- Pearl- Midnight Blue- Neon Green-  Black-- Chrysalis Pendants body measure two inches tall (2.27"" total.)50 of each color will in the blind Bag batch!Estimated odds for each color: 1:11Want to be guaranteed to get the color you want? I've made the option available here: http://www.storenvy.com/products/2666547-chrysalis-pendants-s1(I put them in the above link instead of in the campaign due to no better option here for doing multiple Limited Edition options!) - Large ""TGRI"" Pocket Prop ContainerWith a similar TGRI appearance these containers are perfect for adding to any Steampunk, Scientist or Cosplay ensemble!These containers have a cast resin top and bottom with a clear vial between that can be unscrewed from the top. This will allow you to add a variety of items like ooze, liquid, herbs or  anything else you want!  I am recreating the mold to make it look better when cast and make the surface smoother; the image displaying these will be updated when the new mold is ready! -- the TGRI Containers body measures 4.47 inches (4.9"" total.)
================================
 
What will the funds be used for? 

Laboratory / Studio
As things stand my studio space is about 9x12 ft and is packed, leaving just enough room to walk! This project is intended to assist in the acquisition of a larger space to work in along with!

Vehicle
My car died a week ago, making it hard to get to and from. I need a vehicle that will allow me to get to and from work, along with going to set up at conventions to bring more enjoyable products to everyone!

Hardware: 
I previously tried making items and having them printed by a third party, however on average each part takes fifteen days from order to reception. If something isn't right about the part (size, detail error, etc) it takes another fifteen days to get a new version- not to mention the extremely high cost of getting each print made. Prototyping this way makes it expensive and a very slow process. I have a PLA based printer and used it on the items available here, however it's level of detail is highly limited (I was pushing it with these items) and I need something more capable for the projects waiting in the wings! One hope of this fundraiser is to get enough funds to acquire the hardware I need to be able to produce everything myself. 
Funding Goals: 
- Fallout ShelterIf I can get $2,000 I will be able to purchase a small storage building or shipping container to fix up and use as a studio!- Escape Pod: $3,000My car died last week; I need a good vehicle that will allow me the daily drive to work and to travel to set up at cons! 
- Tools of Construction:  $3,300
--  A Formlabs Form 1 3D Printer is needed to allow me to prototype models and cast molds from them directly.This will allow high quality, high detailed models to be made on site without the three week delay or ""layering"" created by other 3d printers!
Any funds that are above the cost of the above will be used to acquire additional hardware to make creating art faster and better!
--  TabletPC with Wacom pen
-- Basic Jewelry Casting Equipment for Copper, Brass, Bronze and Silver
--  Low level Laser Engraver
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Multiple Item Orders: The Pennies are Counters!If you want more then one item, such as two or three Large Pocket Vials or a few GitD Necklaces, add the appropriate price per item noted in the items description!The pennies ($0.01) are added to make it easier to know how many of an item is being ordered. So, ($X.00) = one item, and ($X.04) equals first item plus four extras, for a total of five  items ordered.

Exploring mediums such as Painting, Tattoo, Silk Screening, Graffiti and Street Installation, Graphic Design, Carpentry, Sculpture, Photography and works in Industrial Metal.<br/> <br/>After so many years of non-stop creation, a vision has a emerged, and with it a theme that merges my love of Bhakti (Devotional) Yoga with a style of art that I'm calling, “Spiritual Pop-Art.”<br/><br/>Messages in the Street uses a universal style of art to spread awareness about Consciousness, Yoga and the wisdom of the sages of India. My job as an artist is to represent the world I see and to tell a story that hasn't yet been told.

Printing costs are a constant expense and much time is spent on the internet researching new ideas and doing project updates. All of what you've seen in my short films has been shot almost entirely with my iPod Touch, and I'm really excited to see how much better we can tell the story with a camera upgrade. Depending on how much we're able to fundraise will determine what camera I can afford. On the lower end of the spectrum, I've been really impressed with the quality and the wide angle format of the infamous GoPro Camera. However, if funds allow I would love to step up to a more professional series camera and I've been very blown away with the performance of the Canon EOS 5D Mark II.<br/><br/><br/><img alt=""pan trinity das"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://a1.s6img.com/cdn/0007/p/1258545_13868341-prn01_lz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><strong>""Prabhupada""</strong><br/>Fine Art Print<br/><br/><em><strong>""Let us focus on what we can give to others and not what we can take for ourselves.

Printing costs are a constant expense and much time is spent on the internet researching new ideas and doing project updates. All of what you've seen in my short films has been shot almost entirely with my iPod Touch, and I'm really excited to see how much better we can tell the story with a camera upgrade. Depending on how much we're able to fundraise will determine what camera I can afford. On the lower end of the spectrum, I've been really impressed with the quality and the wide angle format of the infamous GoPro Camera.

myself in Connecticut. My art mainly focuses on the use of crystals and 
minerals in resin, jewelry and other products.</p><p></p><p><b>The Goal:</b> I 
would like to be able to make a larger quantity of orgone for my shop as
 well as to take more custom orders for those in need of my product. To 
me it is most enjoyable and important item that I create. And if you are
 asking yourself... what on Earth is orgone!? Well here is a brief 
summary! :)</p><p>Orgone is a life force energy that can be collected 
and stored in what is called an orgone generator. It dates back to the 
1930s to a man named Wilhelm Reich who had created items such as orgone 
energy boxes for therapeutic use. Since then different forms, shapes and
 concepts of the science have been made. It is created from specific 
mixtures of organic and inorganic materials that create an energy field.
 Each generator is said to be helpful in turning negative energy into 
positive/balanced energy and to protect against the daily exposure to 
electromagnetic radiation/smog from cell phones, computers, television, 
etc.</p><p>Many people who have purchased an orgone generator from me 
have reported positive energy being felt from the objects. Some have 
said they use them for dream work, to help with sleeping at night, to 
help during meditation and yoga practices, to boost positivity, 
happiness and higher consciousness. With all of the electromagnetic smog
 and negativity we encounter everyday I feel that each person should 
have an orgone item on them, in their house, etc. at some point or 
another and I would like to be able to make more than I am currently so 
that everyone has a wider variety to choose from. </p><p>Each piece I 
create is done in multiple layers with various stones, metals, glitters,
 uv/glow materials, etc. I pour thin layers of resin into molds and 
spend a lot of time per layer making things as perfect as I can. Each 
layer sometimes takes up to 24 hours to fully dry and items I create 
generally range from 3-10+ layers which means each piece takes a few 
days before I can see the finished product.</p><p>For all of my orgone 
projects (and all other resin projects as well) I choose to use a top 
quality epoxy resin which is certainly pricey for the amount. Lower 
quality resin or different types of resin are a better deal for the

<h3>So What is a Tiny House?</h3>
Tiny, or micro, houses are itty bitty homes that utilize space in a unique way. The model that I will be building is only 130 sq ft, and fits onto an 7' x 18' flatbed trailer. More specifically, the design that I will be using is a Tumbleweed Tiny House ""Fencl."" Tumbleweed is a really fantastic group of people, and you can learn more about them here: <a href=""http://www.tumbleweedhouses.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.tumbleweedhouses.com/</a>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why Do This At All? And Who The Heck Is Baba Yaga?</h3>
Several months ago, I wrote an article for Tumbleweed on this very topic, and I've re-posted it below.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<p>If I were forced to provide a single, unqualified answer to the question, “Why are you building a tiny house?” I would have to say: instant love. I was 8 years old when I first saw the inside of an RV trailer, while on a road trip with my parents. Afterwards I demanded of my mother, “Why don’t we live in one of these?” On some level I was wounded. My parents had always known about these perfect, tiny, ship-like houses on wheels, and had chosen to abide in our irritatingly stationary home instead.</p>
<p>Perhaps this instant love of mine was influenced by my fascination with hobos during the Great Depression. I didn’t understand the economic desperation or the myth of the West that had created these men. I only saw that they were tough, that they had what it took to ride the trains. They were free. Somehow the ideas of homelessness, wheeled vehicles, and the ability to carry your home with you became crossed in my mind. An RV seemed to embody both that feeling of home and the ability to leave home to my 8-year-old self.</p>
<p>My childhood dream of living in an RV eventually subsided, and I moved on to other pursuits. Skip forward a decade or so, to the day when I stumbled on the website for the Tumbleweed Tiny House Company. And it happened again. I was instantly, irrevocably in love. And this time it was less impractical. In fact, it seemed that here was the answer to many of my personal dilemmas: how to live sustainability in a culture of consumerism that was simultaneously facing a housing crisis, how to travel the road and feel safe, and how to have my own home while moving across the country for graduate school. I was in love with the aesthetic of Tumbleweed, and with the lifestyle it seemed to offer.</p>
<p>Shortly after I had made the somewhat wild decision to actually build my own house, I began to connect the project to my academic interests. My fields are religious studies and anthropology, and I realized that the tiny house could be studied as material culture, with my own experience as the basis of anthropological research. So I’ve started to study sacred architecture as well as building science, and I hope to one day include my tiny house experience as part of a graduate thesis proposal.</p>
<p>As a woman, a Jew, a woodworker, and the anthropologist conducting a mild field study on myself, several questions have been raised so far. How significant is it, in this day and age, for a woman to be working in construction, or even to be building her own house? What does it mean to be an American Jewish craftsperson, when almost the entirety of my family’s material culture was lost in the pogroms and the Holocaust? What does it mean to live in a home purposely built for wandering, when the anti-Semitic legend of “The Wandering Jew” has been around since the Middle Ages?</p>
<p>I woke up in the middle of the night a few months ago, jerked awake with the force of one thought: I am building Baba Yaga’s house. Baba Yaga (roughly translated to “demon grandmother”) is a Russian fairytale character, a witch who lives in a house on chicken legs. She is a symbol of Russia. So why am I building her house? As I build, I’m also attempting to deconstruct the folk tale of Baba Yaga, in order to shed some light on my own roots, and my own desire to build a little house in the woods. It is a house that walks, and is full of either danger or help, for those who know how to ask for it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Little hut, little hut, stand with your back to the woods, and your front to me!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And the hut turns around, and the protagonist enters. This is the beginning of my tiny house journey. Possibly some of my questions with be answered, or there may be new questions raised. But in the meantime, I’m building, researching, and documenting my tiny Baba Yaga house.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Beginning of the Journey</h3>
This summer, I will begin building my tiny house. I am planning on doing the entire thing myself, which means with the help of my friends and community but very little input from paid professionals. The first step is to purchase a Big Tex 18' flatbed trailer, which runs approximately $2,500 and is the single most expensive purchase I will be making on this project. By contributing at this time you will be aiding in laying the foundation of my new home.</div></div>","So What is a Tiny House?

Several months ago, I wrote an article for Tumbleweed on this very topic, and I've re-posted it below.
 

If I were forced to provide a single, unqualified answer to the question, “Why are you building a tiny house?” I would have to say: instant love. I was 8 years old when I first saw the inside of an RV trailer, while on a road trip with my parents. Afterwards I demanded of my mother, “Why don’t we live in one of these?” On some level I was wounded. My parents had always known about these perfect, tiny, ship-like houses on wheels, and had chosen to abide in our irritatingly stationary home instead.
Perhaps this instant love of mine was influenced by my fascination with hobos during the Great Depression. I didn’t understand the economic desperation or the myth of the West that had created these men. I only saw that they were tough, that they had what it took to ride the trains. They were free. Somehow the ideas of homelessness, wheeled vehicles, and the ability to carry your home with you became crossed in my mind. An RV seemed to embody both that feeling of home and the ability to leave home to my 8-year-old self.
My childhood dream of living in an RV eventually subsided, and I moved on to other pursuits. Skip forward a decade or so, to the day when I stumbled on the website for the Tumbleweed Tiny House Company. And it happened again. I was instantly, irrevocably in love. And this time it was less impractical. In fact, it seemed that here was the answer to many of my personal dilemmas: how to live sustainability in a culture of consumerism that was simultaneously facing a housing crisis, how to travel the road and feel safe, and how to have my own home while moving across the country for graduate school. I was in love with the aesthetic of Tumbleweed, and with the lifestyle it seemed to offer.
Shortly after I had made the somewhat wild decision to actually build my own house, I began to connect the project to my academic interests. My fields are religious studies and anthropology, and I realized that the tiny house could be studied as material culture, with my own experience as the basis of anthropological research. So I’ve started to study sacred architecture as well as building science, and I hope to one day include my tiny house experience as part of a graduate thesis proposal.
As a woman, a Jew, a woodworker, and the anthropologist conducting a mild field study on myself, several questions have been raised so far. How significant is it, in this day and age, for a woman to be working in construction, or even to be building her own house? What does it mean to be an American Jewish craftsperson, when almost the entirety of my family’s material culture was lost in the pogroms and the Holocaust? What does it mean to live in a home purposely built for wandering, when the anti-Semitic legend of “The Wandering Jew” has been around since the Middle Ages?
I woke up in the middle of the night a few months ago, jerked awake with the force of one thought: I am building Baba Yaga’s house. Baba Yaga (roughly translated to “demon grandmother”) is a Russian fairytale character, a witch who lives in a house on chicken legs. She is a symbol of Russia. So why am I building her house? As I build, I’m also attempting to deconstruct the folk tale of Baba Yaga, in order to shed some light on my own roots, and my own desire to build a little house in the woods. It is a house that walks, and is full of either danger or help, for those who know how to ask for it.
 
“Little hut, little hut, stand with your back to the woods, and your front to me!”
 
And the hut turns around, and the protagonist enters. This is the beginning of my tiny house journey. Possibly some of my questions with be answered, or there may be new questions raised. But in the meantime, I’m building, researching, and documenting my tiny Baba Yaga house.


The Beginning of the Journey
This summer, I will begin building my tiny house. I am planning on doing the entire thing myself, which means with the help of my friends and community but very little input from paid professionals. The first step is to purchase a Big Tex 18' flatbed trailer, which runs approximately $2,500 and is the single most expensive purchase I will be making on this project. By contributing at this time you will be aiding in laying the foundation of my new home.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We are an award-winning team of young interior designers and architects who share the same <strong>passion for design</strong>. </p>

<p>HI! DIMITRIS, AIMON, CHRISTINE, MANOLIS, NATHALIE, MYRSINI, THALIA</p>
<h2><strong>THE PROJECT</strong></h2>
<p>“<strong>Interiors</strong> <strong>Revisited</strong>” is a project about creating a <strong>portfolio</strong> that consists of interior design solutions in affordable prices. The project begun by observing the hesitation of people to consult an interior designer in order to make the maximum visual change with the minimum structural interventions in their spaces.</p>
<h2><strong>THE PORTFOLIO</strong></h2>
<p>The portfolio will consist of <strong>interior design proposals</strong> for everyday people, based on real spaces and budgets. In order to prove that interior design can be affordable we need to undertake as many real spaces to decorate as possible. All projects upon completion will also be presented (nameless) at mydezigner.co.uk among other paradigms of interior design solutions. The projects will also be presented in an ebook version. </p>

<p>E BOOK</p>
<h2><strong>HOW IT WORKS  </strong></h2>
<p>Each proposal in the final published portfolio will consist of a plan view of the proposal, a written description and a 3d visualization of the space.</p>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, in order to materialize this project we will need as many spaces to work on. This is where <strong>you</strong> come in. Upon funding you can send us photos and some basic dimensions of a chosen space (up to 100 m² or 1000 ft²) you would like to refresh.  </p>

<h2><strong>THE FUNDING</strong></h2>
<p>Our first target is to include 10 completed projects in this portfolio, but we are more than happy to make our portfolio bigger and propose cozier spaces for you.  </p>
<p>Note that each designer of our team needs about 3 days to complete the layout, 2d and 3d drawings for each space you send us.  </p>
<p>Please make sure you send all the information as soon as possible and not later than 2 months after the funding period ends.

<br/><br/>
During their existence -  the gallery has given back to the community by providing weekly children programs to include story time with sign language, science tutoring, monthly art workshops, monthly poetry for the entire family, Easter Egg Art Workshop, annual photos with Santa Claus, and a host of other events - all at no charge.
<br/><br/>
Mitchieâ€™s Gallery has allowed the community to use their conference room and meeting areas for a variety of events such as town hall meetings, political rallies, book signings, artist shows, health fairs and stage plays, just to give a few examples. And again - all at  no charge. They have provided numerous donations and facilitated event ticket sales to event for promoters at no charge. In 1991, Mitchieâ€™s Gallery became the first African American owned retail center in Austin to be designated as a early mobile voting location. 
<br/><br/>
*Mitchie's Gallery extensive accomplishments and support for the community is literally too long and extensive to capture in a list. They are the largest and oldest African American retail gallery in Austin, Texas - and have transcended being a business and in fact they are a community staple and centralized gathering point.
<br/><br/>
Due to plummeting store sales brought on by the economy and extended multiple absences because of the owner's (Joyce Adejumo) health - Mitchieâ€™s Gallery may soon be forced to close their doors forever. Joyce was blessed to survive a Pulmonary Embolism last year. However, it has required her to make numerous hospital visits and attend Pulmonary Rehab three times a week for the last two months. 
<br/><br/>
Joyce has used her personal savings over the last several months to cover the gaps between the store's income and operating expenses. The combination of declining store sales and increased personal health expenses has depleted all of her personal savings. 
<br/><br/>
It is at this point that the community is rallying our collective resources to do our part and prevent Mitchie's Gallery from closing; but beyond helping Mitchie's Gallery during their time of financial need - we are banding together to return their extensive support and love for the community and give Mitchie's Gallery their flowers now! 
<br/><br/>
All of Austin and friends all over the world are invited to join us in the Biggest Rent Party Austin has ever seen!  
<br/><br/>
We know the current economy has been rough on all of us. But in the Kwanzaa spirit of Ujamaa - or cooperative economics - a little bit from all of us will get the job done! Mitchie's Gallery has an IMMEDIATE financial need of $15,000 to relieve the pressure and keep their doors open. 
<br/><br/>
Here's how you can help: 
<br/><br/>
If you are able to - RIGHT NOW - at any amount - please make a financial contribution that goes directly to the gallery's Paypal Account. 
<br/><br/>
If you have any art, framing or afro-centric gift purchases you need to make, please make a concerted effort to do so THIS WEEK. The gallery now has extended hours from 10a- until 9p, Monday - Saturday and will be open on Sundays from 1:30 - 6p until they have met their funding goals. 
<br/><br/>
Join the gallery on Saturday, February 4, 2012, from 1:30-6p. Mitchieâ€™s Gallery will be kicking off Austin's Black History Month with full day cultural events and Old Fashioned Rent Party benefiting the gallery.

<p>The project is to fund and enhance an art show featuring a wide variety of work created with and inspired by McDonald's Food. Conceptually, the reason behind the show is to comically highlight the parallels between Ancient Egypt, McDonald's Food, and Modern Society. Some of the more interesting pieces include a hamburger that is over a year old and a life sized mummy made of McDonald's food. In the future I would also like to expand this art show to encompass many different aspects of popular culture and add my own style to them as well.</p>
<p>A short explanation of the reasoning behind the show is as follows.</p>
<p>1. Ancient Egypt was preoccupied with achieving a form of immortality through odd customs such as constructing pyramids and mummification.</p>
<p>2. Modern society is preoccupied with achieving a form of immortality through odd customs such as celebrity status and the construction of corporations.</p>
<p>3. McDonald's is highly representative of American culture, even iconic.</p>
<p>4. McDonald's food doesn't decompose if left to dry out. Seriously, just google it. As such archaeologists from the future will be digging this stuff up thousands of years in the future. Especially if something cataclysmic happens to our society.</p>
<p>5. The questions. What could that something cataclysmic be? How can we prepare for it? Do we still want to invest in distractions instead of real solutions and in each other?</p>
<p>6. And finally, if we don't learn to laugh at ourselves future generations are going to do it for us.</p>
<p>Currently I have two McDonald's food mummies completed and would like to make many more. Other works include preserved hamburgers in commercial plastic cases, McDonald's food skulls, and large scale paintings. The funds generated here will be used to purchase more materials, to pay for gas to haul everything from place to place, and to cover other expenses related to the show. Since I am based in Texas, the first shows will be within the state with later shows taking place across the country. If you are interested in booking the show for your gallery or you have any questions, feel free to ask.</p>
<p>Just in case some of you are unsure or on the fence about supporting this project, I'll talk a bit more about myself and what I would hope to accomplish with this and more in the future.</p>
<p>At my core I'm a joker who likes to get people thinking, always have been, always will be. With this Ancient McDonald's Food art show I feel that so far I have done that and can carry it much further as it and my career develops. I've noticed when people begin to take themselves less seriously and can experience the humorous connections between what were once considered harsh realities, they become open and aware of newer, more vibrant solutions. As such I would like to bring my brand of humor to fields such as pop, geek, and internet culture.</p>
<p>By funding this project you will also be helping me lay the foundation for other really cool endeavors that will more directly impact the world around us in a positive manner as well. Apart from art, sociology, and pop culture I'm really drawn towards engineering, computer science, and architecture. Some of my particular interests include constructing efficient and beautiful geodesic domes for habitation/agriculture, robotics for agriculture, video games that harness our creativity into real world solutions, and all manner of manufacturing.</p>
<p>Any amount helps, even $1 but if you want to really help me out I have some fantastic pieces that would fit well with any serious art collector. So if you're interested check it out, grab a piece of my art, and enjoy the ride. And if you can't help out financially but you want to see this project succeed, feel free to pass it along.</p>

How it Works1. Donate to receive your Armada map (and other amazing booty).  2. Once you receive your map in the mail, download the audio.

Everything was going good. Great. And, then just like that, everything changed. As a way to move forward from that instance, I developed a series of works that captured the quintessence of that pain and my struggle to define “self”. Each work tells a small instance of what happened and collectively they narrate the entire story.
Through Photography, Film and Mixed Media I will investigate how our society's social constructs cultivates one's understanding of self. Is it possible to operate outside our social norms? What would these images look like? Can the ""self"" survive independently without such constructs?   I believe that Individuality is an aberration and without our social constructs-race, gender or classism-we have no sense of self. Ultimately I would like my images to ask, “to what credit do we give the individual?”Some of the highlights from this project are ""She Fell From Normalcy;"" a 16mm experimental short about one girl’s fall from grace and venture into the wild. Following that is ""The Manuscript;"" a series of journal entries and notes documenting my life’s experiences over the past 3 years. These entries will be formatted in braille and turned it into a piece of art for the public’s disposal. Lastly, there is ""Within-A Shadow of Self;"" a photo-series that juxtaposes modern day examples of our society’s social constructs against subject matter devoid of it’s social weight.With your help, I would like to present these works in my first solo show as an exhibiting fine artist.
To produce this project I need to raise $5000. Donate today! There are a host of incentives that I am providing folks who can help bring this idea to fruition. Share this on your facebook! Retweet this to your friends and colleagues. Anything that you can do now to help would make a tremendous impact on this project’s success. (Eye of the Storm logo T-shirts in sizes S, M, L and XL.)

<h3>Guerrilla Theurgy Introduction</h3>
<div>
<p>Imagine living in a better, happier, more peaceful world. Imagine a world where creativity, pleasure, joy and spirit received as much attention as commerce, industry, war and competition. We can create a better, more balanced world together, but it requires a shift in consciousness. </p>
<p>Guerrilla Theurgy is a plan to make the world a better place one step at a time by taking small actions in the world to help people feel happier and better, and to awaken ourselves. The specific actions are inspired by the set of 72 angels most well known as the Shemhamphorash. The power of each angel inspires a positive action or instruction.</p>
<p>72 short Videos are in production, each demonstrating one of these angelically inspired actions. See the video above for a fun example. These will be uploaded individually and collected with extras in a DVD.</p>
<p>A deck of 72 cards has been created which give detailed instructions for carrying out these actions. This deck is somewhat like a Tarot, but a Tarot of action rather than oracle.</p>
<p>Together we can change the world in a big way through small things that can be done every day or any day.</p>
<p>This material is created by Jason Augustus Newcomb, author of many books, meditation recordings, and Tarot decks.</p>

<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"">My name is Lance Hitchings, and I'm a freelance CG illustrator in Portland, Oregon. </span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"">Due to major health issues which I contracted while serving in the US Navy in Vietnam, I've been undergoing chemo therapy and unable to work </span><span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">for most of the last year. I've finally exhausted all of my savings and I'm facing eviction from my home of the last 8 years.</span>
</h3>
<p>Thankfully, I've fully recovered my health, but my illustration business has taken a major hit. I not only lost income, I lost clients. I'm rebuilding my client base and I'm back at work, but I'm still a couple of months away from receiving any payments.</p>
<p>I need to find a way to hang on 'til then and that's going to take about $8,750; which I don't have.</p>
<p>So I'm looking for a little help. In exchange for your generosity, I'm offering some of my best personal work as a reward for helping out.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>How did I get here?</h3>
<p>In 2000 I was diagnosed with Hepatitis C, which I contracted while serving in the US Navy.  Last summer the VA Hospital in Portland started me on a year-long round of chemo therapy, which I recently completed, and which was a total success. I'm completely recovered. And thanks to the VA, I don't really have any medical bills to pay.</p>
<p>The real cost of the therapy was dealing with the the laundry list of adverse side-effects caused by the chemo. One result was that for most of the last year, I've been unable to work. </p>
<p>Not being able to work for a year had has repercussions of it's own, the major one being loss of income. But I also lost a couple of my most steady clients. Once I'd recovered enough to be able to work again, I found myself without any projects to work on.  </p>
<p>With lots of spare time on my hands, I focused on a renewed marketing effort. It's already producing results, and I've landed a large new client to replace one of those I lost.</p>
<p>With about 2 months to go until I reach the point at which I anticipate being able to completely put the last year behind me, I've completely exhausted all my financial resources.</p>
<p>And I could use a little help.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What I need.</h3>
<p>$8,750.  This amount will allow me to pay some overdue bills, meet the operational overhead for 2 months for my business and have enough left over to pay my living expenses for the next 2 months.  By that time, payments for projects that are currently in my studio should start arriving.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<p>Another work-in-progress, barely started. This is a concept that I've been working on in my head for the last 15 years.  Only recently did I feel skilled enough to do it justice.</p>
<p>The concept is that it shows the source of the mighty Columbia River. The image is of the Columbia Gorge, looking east towards the Vista House on Crown Point.

I've finally exhausted all of my savings and I'm facing eviction from my home of the last 8 years.

Thankfully, I've fully recovered my health, but my illustration business has taken a major hit. I not only lost income, I lost clients. I'm rebuilding my client base and I'm back at work, but I'm still a couple of months away from receiving any payments.
I need to find a way to hang on 'til then and that's going to take about $8,750; which I don't have.
So I'm looking for a little help. In exchange for your generosity, I'm offering some of my best personal work as a reward for helping out.

How did I get here?
In 2000 I was diagnosed with Hepatitis C, which I contracted while serving in the US Navy.  Last summer the VA Hospital in Portland started me on a year-long round of chemo therapy, which I recently completed, and which was a total success. I'm completely recovered. And thanks to the VA, I don't really have any medical bills to pay.
The real cost of the therapy was dealing with the the laundry list of adverse side-effects caused by the chemo. One result was that for most of the last year, I've been unable to work. 
Not being able to work for a year had has repercussions of it's own, the major one being loss of income. But I also lost a couple of my most steady clients. Once I'd recovered enough to be able to work again, I found myself without any projects to work on.  
With lots of spare time on my hands, I focused on a renewed marketing effort. It's already producing results, and I've landed a large new client to replace one of those I lost.
With about 2 months to go until I reach the point at which I anticipate being able to completely put the last year behind me, I've completely exhausted all my financial resources.
And I could use a little help.

What I need.
$8,750.  This amount will allow me to pay some overdue bills, meet the operational overhead for 2 months for my business and have enough left over to pay my living expenses for the next 2 months.  By that time, payments for projects that are currently in my studio should start arriving.



Who am I?
Although I primarily illustrate industrial & consumer products, I also get to pursue personal work. I know I'm extremely lucky; not everyone gets to follow their passion. And make a living at it.
I build my illustrations, light and render them in 3D, then composite those renders in photoshop. I've been doing this for over a decade and I'm pretty knowledgeable about the technology. For 3 years I wrote articles and a monthly column in ""3D Artist"" magazine, which is published in Great Briton.  I wrote their very first tutorial in Issue #1 about one of my personal illustrations, the ""Tot Rod"". I also write a blog with articles and tutorials.
My clients are usually graphic designers or advertising agencies. I've done stereoscopic animations for BMW, cutaway illustrations of binoculars for Nikon; water bottle animations for Nike; truck illustrations for Freightliner and both illustrations & animations for Exide Batteries. All clients who demand the best.

I like to think that I'm pretty good at what I do, and I'd really like to be able to keep doing it.
You can help.





The Rewards.
In appreciation of those who contribute, I'll be sending out some of my best work. Downloads of digital images suitable for printing (with limited usage rights) as well as signed and numbered edition prints of the same pieces.
A couple of the pieces are currently ""works-in-progress"" and as such will ship as soon as they are completed. Since my clients' projects get first priority, personal work happens in my spare time. I'm guessing that ""The Watcher"" is about 2 months from completion and ""Columbia"" about 6 months.

THE TOWER STATION

This piece is also finished and ready to ship. The Tower Station was also featured in 3D Artist Magazine, and was a 2-part, 18 page tutorial.
The Tower Station and U-Drop Inn Cafe was built in 1936 and is located in Shamrock, Texas; along old Route 66, the Mother Road. It also served as the inspiration for the body shop of the character ""Ramone"" in the 2006 animated film ""Cars""

<p></p>I am Francesco. <br/>Always against
the current, never politically correct, controversial, anarchic. I am an
artist, not because of a certificate or diploma, but because I am compelled to
be. Art, love and fantasy fuel me. For seven years I have lived and worked in
Germany. After these long years of set-backs and hardships I am finally able to
live just as an artist. I have built up my studio, founded a gallery and formed
a network.<span>  </span>
<p>However, it is now time for me
to return to my homeland for one important exhibition. For the first time, I
will take my controversial art to the old centre of the world - Rome. The exhibition is called
RomArt and with it's astronomical stall fees it effectively prohibits the
entrance of new, untested artists. It's time for a breath of fresh air in the
Italian art scene - and this is where I need your help.<span>  </span>
</p>
<p>Please watch the video and
read the long version below. In return for your support you will receive and
original piece of art. More details are below.<span>  </span></p>
<p>It's time - please help take
me back to Rome!</p>

realized that art was going to be my life. I am an Italian, through and

</p><p>Italy is the heart land of the
arts. Where would the world be without the rebirth of culture that took place
in the Renaissance? My homeland is unrivalled in terms of artistic and cultural
heritage; however with it's current economic woes it is no longer a country
that can foster ground breaking, innovative and new art.</p>

</p><p>Very fortunately my journey
brought me to Germany, my new adopted homeland. <br/>It took a lot of commitment and
time but here in Germany I am finally able to live just as an artist.</p>
<p>Believe me, though, it took
years to get here. In fact 7 years. I’ve done my time in shitty jobs in call
centres and restaurants. I slowly build up my studio,
gallery, and network. I have had many set-backs and hardships. I have worked
committedly. And I have put down my roots in Nuremberg, a city I am very happy
to live and work in.

My art is
controversial. I always try to spark conversation with my work, because I
believe this to be the role of an artist in society. To hold up a mirror to the
things we hold as taboo, topics unspeakable and the things we shy away from.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p></p><p></p>

</span></p><p>However it’s been seven years
now in Germany, and living here in a land that so values the freedom of
expression I have come to have some new thoughts about my homeland. In Italy, a
land renowned for its loud and passionate speech, why is it that there so many
topics that are still taboo? More taboo than in Germany? Why don’t the Italian
people feel free to criticise their obviously corrupt leadership? Why does the
Catholic Church there still have such a powerful hold over the people? These
are questions that I want to ask.</p>
<p>So slowly an idea was born. As
an artist I occupy the unique position of being able to be completely honest
and blunt, regardless of social conventions, taboo, and what is politically
sensitive or not. I can speak my truth loudly.It’s time for me to return to my
homeland. To the heart of my homeland and the old centre of the world. I will
go to Rome for one important exhibition.</p>

<p>There is an exhibition called
RomArt Biennale of Art and Culture. Unlike in Germany where access to such
exhibitions is generally available to all artists, Italy often requires
prohibitive exhibit fees that stop all but the already successful, already
accepted, already preapproved artists to participate. RomArt here is no
exception. The stall fees alone are exorbitant - 1400€, effectively keeping out
new, untested and unapproved voices. Only the established are admitted.</p>

</p><p>It is here
that I want to take my provocative art. I want to go to the centre of Italy and
use my art to incite a reaction. I want to start a new discussion. And this is
where I need your help. Like I said, the admission fees to this exhibition are
enough normally to keep me out. So I am asking you to help get me to Rome. </p>
<p>Below
you<span>  can see the breakdown of the costs
associated with this exhibition, and I am asking for your support to cover
these and get me to Rome. Please support me, my art and my journey as an artist
in this important next step. As a thank you for your support you will receive
an original piece of my art.</span></p>

<h3>La mia storia<br/>
</h3>
<p>Molto tempo fa, mi sono reso
conto che l'arte sarebbe stata la mia vita. Io sono un italiano, nel mio
sangue, nella mia carne. Io sono Francesco. Sempre contro corrente,
politicamente scorretto, sempre controverso, anarchico. Sono un artista, non
grazie a un certificato o un diploma, ma perché sono obbligato ad esserlo. <br/>Arte
Amore e Fantasia sono il mio carburante. <br/>Il mio viaggio mi ha portato in
Germania, la mia nuova patria di adozione. <br/>C´è voluto un sacco di impegno e di
tempo, ben 7 anni, ma qui, sono finalmente in grado di vivere della mia arte.
Ho lentamente costruito il mio studio, ho trovato le mie gallerie, ho tessuto
la mia rete. Ho avuto molte battute d'arresto e difficoltà, ma nonostante tutto
e tutti vado avanti. <br/><br/>""Neo Super Pop Art"" è il nome che ho dato alla
mia arte. Attraverso la lente della cultura Pop cerco di riesaminare e
ridefinire simbologie del nostro tempo, trattare temi scottanti e ritrarre
politici e uomini influenti della nostra epoca. Senza tabù, senza riguardo per
le convenzioni sociali vado diretto con colori forti e rombanti a toccare
religione, sesso e politica come nessuno prima d´ora. Ma adesso è giunto il
momento per me di tornare nella mia Patria come Artista. Nel cuore della Arte e
della cultura, un tempo centro del mondo. Andrò a Roma. Qui si terrà una
Biennale di arte e cultura, Romart e qui mi serve il vostro aiuto. Per partecipare è richiesto un onerosa tassa di
iscrizione ma solo con le mie finanze non riesco a permettermi le spese di
ammissione e di viaggio. Con il vostro aiuto potrò portare per la prima volta
la mia arte provocatoria ma piena di fantasia e amore nel mio paese, e fare un
po’ di casino nel mondo marcio dell´arte moderna e forse della vita culturale
del nostro paese.</p>

I am Francesco. Always against
the current, never politically correct, controversial, anarchic. I am an
artist, not because of a certificate or diploma, but because I am compelled to
be. Art, love and fantasy fuel me. For seven years I have lived and worked in
Germany. After these long years of set-backs and hardships I am finally able to
live just as an artist. I have built up my studio, founded a gallery and formed
a network.  
However, it is now time for me
to return to my homeland for one important exhibition. For the first time, I
will take my controversial art to the old centre of the world - Rome. The exhibition is called
RomArt and with it's astronomical stall fees it effectively prohibits the
entrance of new, untested artists. It's time for a breath of fresh air in the
Italian art scene - and this is where I need your help.  

Please watch the video and
read the long version below. In return for your support you will receive and
original piece of art. More details are below.  
It's time - please help take
me back to Rome!






About this project - the long storyA very long time ago I
realized that art was going to be my life. I am an Italian, through and
through, in my blood, in my flesh.
Italy is the heart land of the
arts. Where would the world be without the rebirth of culture that took place
in the Renaissance? My homeland is unrivalled in terms of artistic and cultural
heritage; however with it's current economic woes it is no longer a country
that can foster ground breaking, innovative and new art.


Very fortunately my journey
brought me to Germany, my new adopted homeland. It took a lot of commitment and
time but here in Germany I am finally able to live just as an artist.
Believe me, though, it took
years to get here. In fact 7 years. I’ve done my time in shitty jobs in call
centres and restaurants. I slowly build up my studio,
gallery, and network. I have had many set-backs and hardships. I have worked
committedly. And I have put down my roots in Nuremberg, a city I am very happy
to live and work in.

My art is
controversial. I always try to spark conversation with my work, because I
believe this to be the role of an artist in society. To hold up a mirror to the
things we hold as taboo, topics unspeakable and the things we shy away from.


However it’s been seven years
now in Germany, and living here in a land that so values the freedom of
expression I have come to have some new thoughts about my homeland. In Italy, a
land renowned for its loud and passionate speech, why is it that there so many
topics that are still taboo? More taboo than in Germany? Why don’t the Italian
people feel free to criticise their obviously corrupt leadership? Why does the
Catholic Church there still have such a powerful hold over the people? These
are questions that I want to ask.
So slowly an idea was born. As
an artist I occupy the unique position of being able to be completely honest
and blunt, regardless of social conventions, taboo, and what is politically
sensitive or not. I can speak my truth loudly.It’s time for me to return to my
homeland. To the heart of my homeland and the old centre of the world. I will
go to Rome for one important exhibition.







There is an exhibition called
RomArt Biennale of Art and Culture. Unlike in Germany where access to such
exhibitions is generally available to all artists, Italy often requires
prohibitive exhibit fees that stop all but the already successful, already
accepted, already preapproved artists to participate. RomArt here is no
exception. The stall fees alone are exorbitant - 1400€, effectively keeping out
new, untested and unapproved voices. Only the established are admitted.

It is here
that I want to take my provocative art. I want to go to the centre of Italy and
use my art to incite a reaction. I want to start a new discussion. And this is
where I need your help. Like I said, the admission fees to this exhibition are
enough normally to keep me out. So I am asking you to help get me to Rome. 
Below
you  can see the breakdown of the costs
associated with this exhibition, and I am asking for your support to cover
these and get me to Rome. Please support me, my art and my journey as an artist
in this important next step. As a thank you for your support you will receive

La mia storia

Molto tempo fa, mi sono reso
conto che l'arte sarebbe stata la mia vita. Io sono un italiano, nel mio
sangue, nella mia carne. Io sono Francesco. Sempre contro corrente,
politicamente scorretto, sempre controverso, anarchico. Sono un artista, non
grazie a un certificato o un diploma, ma perché sono obbligato ad esserlo. Arte
Amore e Fantasia sono il mio carburante. Il mio viaggio mi ha portato in
Germania, la mia nuova patria di adozione. C´è voluto un sacco di impegno e di
tempo, ben 7 anni, ma qui, sono finalmente in grado di vivere della mia arte.
Ho lentamente costruito il mio studio, ho trovato le mie gallerie, ho tessuto
la mia rete. Ho avuto molte battute d'arresto e difficoltà, ma nonostante tutto
e tutti vado avanti. ""Neo Super Pop Art"" è il nome che ho dato alla
mia arte. Attraverso la lente della cultura Pop cerco di riesaminare e
ridefinire simbologie del nostro tempo, trattare temi scottanti e ritrarre
politici e uomini influenti della nostra epoca. Senza tabù, senza riguardo per
le convenzioni sociali vado diretto con colori forti e rombanti a toccare
religione, sesso e politica come nessuno prima d´ora. Ma adesso è giunto il
momento per me di tornare nella mia Patria come Artista. Nel cuore della Arte e
della cultura, un tempo centro del mondo. Andrò a Roma. Qui si terrà una
Biennale di arte e cultura, Romart e qui mi serve il vostro aiuto. Per partecipare è richiesto un onerosa tassa di
iscrizione ma solo con le mie finanze non riesco a permettermi le spese di
ammissione e di viaggio. Con il vostro aiuto potrò portare per la prima volta
la mia arte provocatoria ma piena di fantasia e amore nel mio paese, e fare un
po’ di casino nel mondo marcio dell´arte moderna e forse della vita culturale
del nostro paese.

<p>We have seen the magic work!  At Burning Man, in Las Vegas, at Reno, across the country and around the world, people have thought about what they want for the future, written it down, and began to see those dreams become reality.  Couples have met – and even married – at the Cube!  </p>

</div></div>","I’m Scott Cohen (skeeter on the playa), the artist behind the Life Cube Project. 
Inspired by a trip to Burning Man over a decade ago, the Life Cube Project was created as an interactive and experiential public art installation. The community of 'Cube-ists' who embrace its mission continues to grow every year.  For the Life Cube at Burning Man 2015, we’re going to create a giant collaborative piece connecting art and community in Black Rock City and beyond!


 
GROWING THE LIFE CUBE PROJECT
Our art has grown from a small, decorated 8x8 foot box to a sculptural building that measures 24x24 feet with pillars and posts and platforms and stairs and ladders. Totally redesigned with our team’s architects, the Life Cube at Burning Man 2015 will be painted by muralists in real time, with a huge wall featuring a mosaic combining artwork contributed from over a thousand Burners.  

The community is encouraged and invited to climb, paint, and draw on the Life Cube. We love the creative artists who come and paint fabulous murals.  We love the people who share their thoughts on the chalkboard walls, creating a colorful, ever-changing and evolving installation.  

FOUNDING PRINCIPLES
The Life Cube Project was founded based on the belief that if you write down your goals, dreams, wishes, and aspirations, the probability of it happening is much, much higher!


We have seen the magic work!  At Burning Man, in Las Vegas, at Reno, across the country and around the world, people have thought about what they want for the future, written it down, and began to see those dreams become reality.  Couples have met – and even married – at the Cube!  


CONNECTING ART + COMMUNITY
Connecting art and community means that we’ve grown our Life Cube Project team as well.  This year’s crew includes the Artist, a Project Manager, Master Carpenters and Builders, Lighting Designers, Artists and Painters, Electricians, Architects, Care-and-Feeding and Clean-Up Crews, Master Burn and Pyro Leads, Fire Safety Perimeter Crew, Digital and Social Media Wizards, and many more.  


Our team has over a hundred volunteers who believe in the Life Cube Project, contributing their time and talent to bring our art to Black Rock City this year. We hope that you'll join us with your support to bring the Life Cube back to the Playa this year!


Inscribed on many 1000s of Wish-Stick postcards, the community’s wishes along with the entire Life Cube structure and the art will be burned in a spectacular and spiritual ceremony at the end of the festival.  When you support the Life Cube Project, your goals, dreams and wishes will be deposited into the Cube and join with others in a flaming tower of ash and cinders going up into the Universe. 


FUNDING – WE NEED YOUR HELP TO MAKE IT HAPPEN!
We are thrilled to have been selected as an Honorarium installation by Burning Man this year. As a result, the Life Cube is supported in part by a grant from Burning Man, but that funding is only a fraction of what we need to bring this huge installation to Black Rock City in 2015. 


Our costs include purchasing over 10,000 pounds of lumber and hardware, electrical and electronic equipment for dazzling lighting displays, trucks and transportation for tools and materials, generators, light towers, safety gear, painting supplies, FREE canvas for collaborative artwork contributed by 1000 members of the community, scissor lifts, ladders, scaffolding, leave-no-trace clean up equipment and disposal, and especially new this year, pyrotechnic effects and fuel for our expert burn specialists to present a spectacular finish to the Life Cube at Burning Man 2015.

<p>In the history of photography in Guatemala this edition
of the festival surprised us and permanently immersed us in the abilities of
dialogue, communication and new models of work that the digital era allows.
After 2013 we were no longer the same. The Photographic production in Guatemala
began to play in major leagues. The intertwine of looks that causes to see
photographs from Gutamala. China, Mexico and South Africa, Costa Rica, Brazil
and Europe in simultaneously ways, put us in front of that infinite ability to
travel in space without borders that draws the digital age. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>However, beyond what was that celebration of photography,
it is worth asking: that day we stopped being just Guatemalans? Were we
sufficiently sensitive to these other realities? Could we understand that we
are so similar, different, fragile and complex such as Chinese, Mexican or
South Africans? This is what causes a great festival: reflect, reflect, and
reflect on the paradoxes of our existence.</p>

personal to me because David was my best friend since the 70's, my partner as
an art activist and my mentor throughout my career, in the early 70's David and
I organized and headed one of Chicago's first Latino not-for-profit artists run collective, El Taller/The Workshop that was credited for many cultural arts events
free to all of the community, with money from the  Department of Human
Resources of Chicago and the Lutheran foundation we offer art workshops in
all of the mediums, publications, with financial support from the Illinois Arts
Council we sponsors the first anthology of Midwest Latino artists, and for ten years we organized workshops, presentation and
exhibitions throughout the Midwest and the US, As a matter-of-fact just before
his passing, ironically we were on the phone talking about some ideas of doing
some cultural arts exchange programs between Puerto Ricans on the island and
the ones in the United States. Typically when we speak of cross-cultural you
would think of two different countries, but in our case it will be a cultural
exchange program within our own community, In our conversation David told me
about this on line fund-raising phenomena, David and I both agreed that we
needed to get connected with some alternatives online fund-raising sources, to
make up for the extreme city, state and federal cuts on the arts, funds that
David would refer to as ""chump change"" that most of the time never
was intended for us or never reached us.</span></p><p></p>
<p>A Cross-cultural exchange program with a mission of connecting and
creating an artistic dialogue between the two groups of our society. With half
of our community of about 4 million living in the United States and the other
half living here on the island, both groups are citizens but the island is a
colony and because of it's political status one group knows nothing about the
other group experiences, accomplishments or of the day to day on goings of
there society, David and I wanted to change this reality. So now here I am, on
line asking for your support in this awesome task of bringing our 8 million
people together through art and culture. Our mural represents the beginning and
promotes what David and I were talking about, this project will work towards
this end, creating a dialogue between the community of the town of Cidra,
Puerto Rico and the city of Chicago, IL, and it will serve as an example on how
artists working with the community could share there experiences on the island
and in Chicago and with the rest of the world.</p>

its production (March to April 2014) offers education outreach for the
surrounding area of Cidra and Caguas, Puerto Rico. This unique artistic joint effort by two
Chicago Latino veteran muralists (Gamaliel Ramirez and Roberto Valadez)
share in their
homage to the late poet, David Hernandez (1946-2013) and their artistic
heritage with local children, professionals, and young artists. Inspired by
Caribbean and Latin American artistic knowledge, Ramirez and Valadez bring to
this project a community-driven vision, a Chicago artistic tradition of
getting its audience partake in:<p></p>
<p>Cultural Knowledge: The mural's
basic theme is to
honor an important ""Chirican"" (Chicago-Puerto Rican) community poet,
David Hernandez but will represent Caribbean, Latin American and local history
relating other themes such as the Latino/a cultural migration to U.S.
and elsewhere. Local participants and community partnerships can get cultural
enrichment!</p>
<p>Mural Preparation: Professional understanding of technical skills with
various paints out-doors mural production, and ""Eco-friendly""
approaches (recycled material and no usage of spray aerosol). This knowledge
can be useful for basic job skill training and protects island culture!</p>
<p>Professional Development: The project's aim is to pay homage to Hernandez
benefits nearby cultural institutions and schools. This mural, through
internship and partnerships,
can provide job training for local educators and artists by participating in a
bilingual (English/Spanish) format!</p>
<p>Young People Mentoring: The project could serve as a tool for
""capacity building"" - in other words the passing one's knowledge to
another person. In this case, local young people (regardless of color, gender
or social class) get both artistic and cultural knowledge. Cultivating people
is an investment; DHMM is built on the idea of art building community!</p>

educational organizations including the Chicago Public School
system, the National Museum of Mexican Art, Urban Gateways, and Gallery 37. They have
conducted community and professional education workshops for thousands of
people, serving a diversity of Chicago

Their community-driven and public mural works can be found in many Chicago ethnic

So what do you say do you have a dollar?Imagina cada dólar es importante, ahora imagínese si cada puertorriqueño y su á amigos aquí en la isla y en todos los Estados dieron $ 1 a nuestra propuesta de ""David Hernández conmemorativo Mural"" acabaríamos con más de 8 millones de dólares, más que suficiente para nuestro proyecto y para muchos proyectos artísticos culturales de la comunidad de la isla y en los Estados Unidos durante varios años. Entonces, ¿qué puedes decir qué tienes un dólar?Una traducción española por Google de narrativa Inglés de nuestra propuesta.A Spanish translation by Google follows the English narrative of our proposal.I was born in the Bronx, of NY City, a cancer survivor, and a farther
of two daughters and a proud grandfather of two grandchildren, a Nuyorican who
has worked in Chicago as an artist/teaching
artists for over 40 years and now living and working in San
 Juan, Puerto Rico. In facebook at:
https://www.facebook.com/gamaliel.ramirez.58 and on my web site at:
http://gamalielramirez.weebly.com I have posted albums of my paintings of the
60's, 70's, 80's, 90's and more recent works, other posting include my murals,
poetry, photography, videos, resume, exhibition record, artist statement and
more.
Our mission is a multi-discipline, multi-cultural and a cultural
exchange project, a memorial mural to be designed, created and presented by a
multicultural group of artists. Our goals are to create a memorial mural in the
poet's hometown of Cidra, Puerto Rico to honor the literary works of the late
David Hernandez the unofficial poet laureate of Chicago, IL, AKA ""Famous
Poet"" and ""Chi-town Brown"". 
This approximately 12 x 105 ft. memorial mural to be painted
on a prominent wall visible to everybody who visits the town, the mural will be
designed and painted by two of Chicago's renowned muralist artists Gamaliel
Ramirez from Humboldt Park's Puerto Rican Community, and Robert Valade http://www.robertvaladez.com from
Pilsen's Mexican Community, with the assistance of local area art students and
all who wish to participate from Cidra, Puerto Rico, this town Cidra and the
city of Chicago played a major role in influencing many of David's works and finally the mural will be dedicated as a free public event at a Chicago style dedication, with a live performances by invited spoken word poets and the musical group, ""Street Sounds"",featuring original members Dean Karabatsos on lead 6 and 12 string guitars, Francisco Gonzalez on second guitar, Gustavo Pena and Isabelino ""Silo"" Landor on percussion, Todd Hill on bass and new members; lead vocalist, Ana Santos Sanchez, who is also from the town of Cidra and Ethan Adelsman on violin.
Street Sounds https://www.facebook.com/StreetSoundsSonidosdelaCalle is an award-winning performance ensemble of music, songs, spoken word and lyrics that was founded in 1971 by poet David Hernandez and guitarist Dean Karabatsos. Joined by guitarist Francisco Gonzalez and percussionist Gustavo Pena. The group began creating music that uses elements of spoken word, Latin and contemporary jazz, blues, classical and afro-Caribbean and tipico music. The group is now a seven piece ensemble composed of a female vocalist, upright bass, 2 percussionists, violin and acoustic guitars.
This project is of the utmost importance to my community and very
personal to me because David was my best friend since the 70's, my partner as
an art activist and my mentor throughout my career, in the early 70's David and
I organized and headed one of Chicago's first Latino not-for-profit artists run collective, El Taller/The Workshop that was credited for many cultural arts events
free to all of the community, with money from the  Department of Human
Resources of Chicago and the Lutheran foundation we offer art workshops in
all of the mediums, publications, with financial support from the Illinois Arts
Council we sponsors the first anthology of Midwest Latino artists, and for ten years we organized workshops, presentation and
exhibitions throughout the Midwest and the US, As a matter-of-fact just before
his passing, ironically we were on the phone talking about some ideas of doing
some cultural arts exchange programs between Puerto Ricans on the island and
the ones in the United States. Typically when we speak of cross-cultural you
would think of two different countries, but in our case it will be a cultural
exchange program within our own community, In our conversation David told me
about this on line fund-raising phenomena, David and I both agreed that we
needed to get connected with some alternatives online fund-raising sources, to
make up for the extreme city, state and federal cuts on the arts, funds that
David would refer to as ""chump change"" that most of the time never
was intended for us or never reached us.
A Cross-cultural exchange program with a mission of connecting and
creating an artistic dialogue between the two groups of our society. With half
of our community of about 4 million living in the United States and the other
half living here on the island, both groups are citizens but the island is a
colony and because of it's political status one group knows nothing about the
other group experiences, accomplishments or of the day to day on goings of
there society, David and I wanted to change this reality. So now here I am, on
line asking for your support in this awesome task of bringing our 8 million
people together through art and culture. Our mural represents the beginning and
promotes what David and I were talking about, this project will work towards
this end, creating a dialogue between the community of the town of Cidra,
Puerto Rico and the city of Chicago, IL, and it will serve as an example on how
artists working with the community could share there experiences on the island
and in Chicago and with the rest of the world.
Educational Aspects: The David Hernandez Memorial Mural (DHMM) during
its production (March to April 2014) offers education outreach for the
surrounding area of Cidra and Caguas, Puerto Rico. This unique artistic joint effort by two
Chicago Latino veteran muralists (Gamaliel Ramirez and Roberto Valadez)
share in their
homage to the late poet, David Hernandez (1946-2013) and their artistic
heritage with local children, professionals, and young artists. Inspired by
Caribbean and Latin American artistic knowledge, Ramirez and Valadez bring to
this project a community-driven vision, a Chicago artistic tradition of
getting its audience partake in:
Cultural Knowledge: The mural's
basic theme is to
honor an important ""Chirican"" (Chicago-Puerto Rican) community poet,
David Hernandez but will represent Caribbean, Latin American and local history
relating other themes such as the Latino/a cultural migration to U.S.
and elsewhere. Local participants and community partnerships can get cultural
enrichment!
Mural Preparation: Professional understanding of technical skills with
various paints out-doors mural production, and ""Eco-friendly""
approaches (recycled material and no usage of spray aerosol). This knowledge
can be useful for basic job skill training and protects island culture!
Professional Development: The project's aim is to pay homage to Hernandez
benefits nearby cultural institutions and schools. This mural, through
internship and partnerships,
can provide job training for local educators and artists by participating in a
bilingual (English/Spanish) format!
Young People Mentoring: The project could serve as a tool for
""capacity building"" - in other words the passing one's knowledge to
another person. In this case, local young people (regardless of color, gender
or social class) get both artistic and cultural knowledge. Cultivating people
is an investment; DHMM is built on the idea of art building community!
Ramirez and Valadez are leading community muralists who have worked with internationally known cultural and
educational organizations including the Chicago Public School
system, the National Museum of Mexican Art, Urban Gateways, and Gallery 37. They have
conducted community and professional education workshops for thousands of
people, serving a diversity of Chicago
land and its surrounding communities.
Their community-driven and public mural works can be found in many Chicago ethnic
neighborhoods. Ramirez's local Chicago mural (favored by U.S. Midwest's
Boricua populations) ""Sea of Flags"" was featured in the Hollywood
movie, ""Nothing Like the Holidays"" with Latino actor, John Leguizamo!
The money raised in this campaign will pay: Two Muralist …………………………...   8,000.00 Muralist Housing B & B ……………....    2,100.00Mural Materials, Supplies …..………..    2,500.00Musicians ……………………………..    1,500.00Musicians Housing ……………………   2,700.00Musical Instrument and P A rental …..   2,000.00 Airline Transportation ………………..    4,000.00 Publicist ………………………………    1,000.00 Miscellaneous, Muralist local transportation, Documentation ………………………    1,500.00                                                   Total $25,300.00If we don't reached the entire goal requested, we will do with what we
get, we probably would not be able to bring all of the musicians, but I'm
confident that the folks here on the island and all of David's fans and friends
in Chicago and
throughout the world will not let us down.
Actually the budget should be much greater but I'm looking toward
offsetting some of the cost with in-kind contribution from the mayor of the town
and from the local business to provide publicity, other resources such as food and drinks for the dedication
and possibly a night out a round the town for all of the participating artists. Traducción española Google de nuestra propuesta.Nací en el Bronx, NY, un sobreviviente del cáncer, y una más de las dos hijas y un abuelo orgulloso de dos nietos, un Nuyorican que ha trabajado en Chicago como artista artista/enseñanza para más de 40 años y que ahora vive y que trabaja en San Juan , Puerto Rico.

</h3>
<div>
<p>I've been invited to travel to Shanghai, China January 3-13, 2016 to participate in the ArtShape Mammoth Art exhibition and symposium along with 4 other artists from around the United States. I was selected by ArtShape Mammoth and Shanghai curator, LuFei Sun, who will be guiding us around the city. <br/></p>
<p>The other artists who will be traveling and exhibiting with me are <a href=""http://www.aubreyroemer.com/wp/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Aubrey Roemer</a>, <a href=""http://davidalban.com/home.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">David Alban</a>, <a href=""http://cargocollective.com/kristentordellawilliams"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kristen Tordella-Williams</a> and <a href=""http://www.artshapemammoth.org/amy-joy-hosterman/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Amy Joy Hosterman</a>. <br/></p>
<p>We plan to install our artwork (in my case, paintings) at <a href=""http://www.uartspace.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">United Art Space</a> on 50 Moganshan Road, which is a contemporary art district that has been compared to New York's Soho. The exhibition will be on display for the month of January. We will give artist talks, and visit Shanghai galleries and artist's studios to network. This would be my first International exhibition, and traveling to China has been a dream of mine for some time. I became interested in Chinese art when my aunt gave me a brush painting book as a teenager. That early experience shaped my development as a painter. This is an except from my graduate thesis: <br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p> ""I especially identify
with the organization of space in traditional Chinese landscape painting. The
space is often organized vertically, rather than horizontally or through linear
perspective.</p>
<p><a href=""#_ftn1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span></span></span></span></a>The treatment of space and light inside of a

<ul> <li>I'm from Rolette, North Dakota, attended the University of North Dakota and earned a BFA in Painting and a BA in Communications and Honors. Then I attended graduate school at Montana State University in Bozeman for my MFA. Now I live in Rice Lake, Wisconsin, where I work as a professional artist and Lecturer of Art at the University of Wisconsin - Barron County.

Since 2013, I participated in a group exhibition in Bushwick at Loft 594, exhibited my work in a two person show in Fort Bragg California, spent at week making artwork at the Visitor Center Sustainable Practices Symposium in Michigan's U.P., and most recently I was selected by 4Heads to be part of the ASM group show at the <a href=""http://www.4heads.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Governor's Island Art Fair </a>along with 9 other Artshape mammoth members for the month of September. <br/><br/>

</li>
<li>Artist Statement- I explore geographic formations, organisms and natural phenomena, 
through the medium of acrylic paint. My painting process allows for 
spontaneity and chaos to play a role, as a way to connect to disorder 
and entropy. This involves spraying, dripping, and applying color with 
wide hake brushes onto an absorbent panel. An otherworldly element is 
added as I contort and manipulate the illusion of space on the painted 
surface, intuitively working in layers. Pours, drips and blooms of 
pigment speak to gravity and help to create an illusion of deep space or
 surface tension. <br/>

& Art were a constant for me as a Child.
I
loved to draw at an early age, sharing the joy of the arts to as many
people as possible. I attended many art schools  to enhance this gift. I have a Ad Art degree and a Fiber Degree with a minor in Painting , from CCA in Cal. and Suny @ Farmingdale . And studied Religion, Etching , pottery @Covenant College .



Painting
	a 8 foot mural
 on the wall at 15 yrs old.


Designing
	clothes for my dolls and friends .


Painting
	many Victorian costumes  for hours


Making
	my own clothes.


Designing
	wrapping paper, regularly.


Starting
	Mural painting on my campus, a 14'wall.


Designing
	shoes painting, feathered earrings 
	

Working
	for the leather , and glass artist ,Donating
	to Others to share the love of the arts became a Vital Part of My
	Life

Loving
	the arts and starting the art shows at my Ga. Campus


Donating
	my time for a full year to support the arts on campus.


For
	over 8 years have I have tremendously enjoyed donating my time,
	organizing a youth art of about 300 pieces during the State run Fair
	here in Pa.


I
	also donate my time in a class for parents.


  Silk
Painting gave me and others so much life.

       After
college I started a large family ( I have 5 children), which didn't
really allow me to devote as much time as I needed towards my fiber
and art creations . Although life was very demanding, I was inspired
to paint, the desire to bring happy energy and thoughts to myself and
all of us.In 1988 I took an additional class, and there I fell in
Love with the flow and intensity of brilliant colors, which brought
even more life and joy to myself and others. I slowly showed in craft
shows, have much success, eventually building up to 15 shows a year
for 25 years. 


 The
Joys and Difficulty of the Craft show scene

It’s
	wonderful to meet people, sharing the life and joyful expression of
	the arts


 Having
	the opportunity to create is truly an amazing Gift from God!


Sadly,
	many more people used to attend our shows and support us (the
	artists) by purchasing our unique designs and creations,
	Due
	to the economy and the lack of “boost” for promoting love of the
	arts, it’s extremely hard for us to now make a living


Physically,
	the work is very demanding, loading and unloading and as we get
	older, it becomes more and more exhausting.  
	


The
	overhead for entering and performing in art shows is financially
	draining: fees from the promoters, gas, hotels, city parking ,the
	cost of silk, hiring American
	workers to aid in production, etc… Ultimately, the profit
	required in order to survive is dwindling. 
	

As
you can see, the risk is far exceeding the rewards and thus I have
reinvented my product, which is where I now need help from others.
This is a different situation and somewhat uncomfortable for me, as I
was the one in the past who was “helping”....
HOPE
for the artist 




Reinventing
	ourselves and our product is a risky constant and a vital need for
	existence. When we are brave enough to make necessary changes
	however, the benefits are great for all of us, the artist and the
	consumer who love and appreciate true art. 
	


Reinvention;
	I now have an opportunity to
	print
	my art expressions in America, reducing costs, without compromising
	the beauty and quality of my design and expression. The designs
	would be much more affordable for me to create and for the consumer.
	It would allow me to maintain my love of creating my one of a kind
	designs and to once again create an appreciation of original design
	to the consume

<h3>About Our Nonprofit</h3> <p>The Denver Art Society is a Art Coop, Visual and Performing Arts Gallery, Music Venue, and Art School. Our building is over 100 years old, and was abandoned for some 30 or 40 years before we took residence. Now almost 5 years later, we have gotten most of the major repairs to the building done. But we still have leaks in the roof, floors, and no heat on main floor and in basement studios. </p>
<p>We've come a long way, but we are only just getting started. This building in the Santa Fe Arts District has become the beacon of acceptance and artistic freedom in the Santa Fe Arts District. We have over 85 active members in our  Art Coop (doubled in past 6 months). And around 50 different artists of all mediums and styles exhibiting their art in our 4000 sqft gallery. We don't ask for commission, and we DO NOT censor. DAS is open 7 days a week from 10 am to 7 pm (no other gallery on the ArtWalk is open this much).</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/752478/files/20140729135103-IMG_20140614_191151.jpg?1406667063"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The Art Coop was created to be the backbone of DPAU (Denver Public Arts University). The success of the Art Coop ensures the future of free and universal access to the arts. </p>
<p>Currently the Coop is operating on a streamlined budget. Funds collected from this campaign will go towards the Coop and its projects, including the production of the showcase itself.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>How we serve</h3> <p>Our non profit organization is volunteer-powered from the ground up. </p> <ul>
<li>The Art Coop supports artists and students who are often under served in the community.</li> <li>We offer opportunity to new and young artists</li> <li>Give support to struggling students and artists</li>

<h3>The road ahead</h3> <p>We've come a long way, and were not about to give up now! To ensure the continued success of our Art Coop we need to...</p>

<li>continue building repairs (floors, plumbing, leaks, no heat, lights)</li>
<li>maintain a budget that pays for Exhibitions and Advertising costs, as well as cleaning and office supplies.</li>

Atomga will be making their 2nd appearance at Art Out Loud this year. They'll be getting the dance floor started at 7. Listen to their music here.

 
""If you are looking for an honest singer with the blood of a blues man, you can't do much better.""- Wyomingnews.com. Sawmill Joe will be performing at 2:45.


A review by 5280.com had this to say about Patrick Dethlefs- ""His soothing voice evokes an American, countrified version of Belle and Sebastian, supported by graceful layers of acoustic instrumentation, and expertly played"". His set is at 5:45.


Progressive, experimental and ambient, Lucida Tela will be rocking out at 8:15. Check out their sound here.

To close out the night at 9:15, will be the electro funk dance tunes of Vine Street Vibes. Listen to their music here.

About Our Nonprofit The Denver Art Society is a Art Coop, Visual and Performing Arts Gallery, Music Venue, and Art School. Our building is over 100 years old, and was abandoned for some 30 or 40 years before we took residence. Now almost 5 years later, we have gotten most of the major repairs to the building done. But we still have leaks in the roof, floors, and no heat on main floor and in basement studios. 
We've come a long way, but we are only just getting started. This building in the Santa Fe Arts District has become the beacon of acceptance and artistic freedom in the Santa Fe Arts District. We have over 85 active members in our  Art Coop (doubled in past 6 months). And around 50 different artists of all mediums and styles exhibiting their art in our 4000 sqft gallery. We don't ask for commission, and we DO NOT censor. DAS is open 7 days a week from 10 am to 7 pm (no other gallery on the ArtWalk is open this much).


The Art Coop was created to be the backbone of DPAU (Denver Public Arts University). The success of the Art Coop ensures the future of free and universal access to the arts. 
Currently the Coop is operating on a streamlined budget. Funds collected from this campaign will go towards the Coop and its projects, including the production of the showcase itself.
  How we serve Our non profit organization is volunteer-powered from the ground up.  
The Art Coop supports artists and students who are often under served in the community. We offer opportunity to new and young artists Give support to struggling students and artists





The road ahead We've come a long way, and were not about to give up now! To ensure the continued success of our Art Coop we need to...

continue building repairs (floors, plumbing, leaks, no heat, lights)
maintain a budget that pays for Exhibitions and Advertising costs, as well as cleaning and office supplies.
pay bills (rent, water/sewer, internet, utilities)





Other Ways You Can Help We understand that not everyone can donate fiscally. Here are some other ways you can help us. 
Volunteer. We always need more volunteers at our events and working in our gallery. Promote Denver Art Society through social media (Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, instagram)
Tell your friends and family about this campaign.

<p>[Na dole strony: wersja polska]</p><p><b>ENGLISH VERSION:</b></p><p>I am a sculptor and woodworker with an MFA in Sculpture from
Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw [2012]. I create <b>abstract forms</b>, combining various
materials, textures and colors. Applying great care to proportions and
composition, I make <b>objects that encourage sensual exploration</b>. You can
see some of my pieces here: <a href=""http://www.olgamicinska.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.olgamicinska.com</a> or simply open the Gallery tab on top of this site.</p>
<p>Having traveled a lot and learned from many excellent artists
and craftspeople in different parts of the world, I gathered experience in
handwork and grew interest in symbolic content of crafted objects. I am
currently working on small and medium scale pieces, expressing my
recent observations on the tangible matter and the act of making. When
exploring cultures of various places, I have become attracted to the
indigenous, the folk, and the vernacular. In the<i><b>Tools of Abstraction </b></i><b>project</b> I want to investigate how
natural circumstances affect the <b>identity of a maker</b>, and how objects are
formed in relation to <b>encountered environment</b>. I am currently engaged with
research and writing on material culture, focusing on a purely practical
application of implements in relation to more metaphoric contexts and genuine
need of <b>contact with physical matter</b>.</p>
<p>I am currently investing my own time, energy and material
resources into making this project come true, but I still need some support to
complete it and present the results to the public. The project has been
selected by <b><i>La Fragua/The Forge </i>international artist residency in
Belalcázar (Spain)</b> to be developed this spring/summer. I have been accepted for
a two-month production residency in this well-established art center located in
a fifteenth-century Convent of Santa Clara. A beautiful site and a
vibrant environment! <i>La Fragua </i>community assists artists with the
process and connects with local arts- and craftspeople. This is a grand
opportunity to advance the<i>Tools
of Abstraction </i>project.
During my previous stays in Spain I learned how stimulating and creative an
environment it can offer. A change of location and a quiet surrounding will
certainly help me focus on my newest artworks. My goal is to craft a series of
sculptures, collaborating with makers from around Belalcázar, and using local
materials (olive tree wood, clay, metals, fibers).</p>
<p>The funds I aim to collect will cover <b>residency fees</b>
(accommodation and institutional services) and <b>transportation to Belalcázar</b>. I
will be very grateful for your support for my project. <b>By contributing to the<i>Tools of Abstraction </i>you will become an art patron and
collector!</b> All the perks in the offer are artworks I have recently made or will
produce during my stay at <i>La
Fragua</i>. During the residency I will prepare materials for a <b>limited edition of
a printed zine-catalogue</b>: texts and images documenting my investigation into
the metaphorical aspects of material culture. Elegantly designed, the catalogue
will include sketches, photographs and essays. After the residency, I will work
towards a show with the produced sculptures. You can be sure you'll get an
invitation!</p>

<p><b>WERSJA POLSKA:</b></p>
<p>Zajmuję się rzeźbą, pracuję przede wszystkim z drewnem. Dyplom
na Wydziale Rzeźby Akademii Sztuk Pięknych w Warszawie obroniłam w 2012 roku.
Tworzę <b>formy abstrakcyjne</b>, w których łączę ze sobą różne materiały, faktury i
barwy. Z dbałości o proporcje i kompozycję powstają <b>obiekty, które zapraszać mają do
zmysłowych eksploracji</b>. Niektóre z moich rzeźb i projektów możesz zobaczyć tu:
<a href=""http://www.olgamicinska.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.olgamicinska.com</a> lub w zakładce Gallery, na górze tej strony.</p>
<p>W ostatnich latach wiele podróżowałam, odwiedzając warsztaty w
różnych częściach świata oraz ucząc się od wielu doskonałych artystów i
rzemieślników. Tym samym zyskałam doświadczenie w pracy manualnej, a także
pogłębiłam  zainteresowanie symbolicznego
ładunku w ręcznie wykonanych obiektach. Odkrywając kultury związanych z
różnymi miejscami, zaczęły pociągać mnie wątki sztuki rdzennej, ludowej,
wernakularnej. W projekcie <i><b>Narzędzia
abstrakcji</b></i>, chcę zająć się sytuacjami, w których warunki naturalne wpływają
na <b>tożsamość twórcy</b>, oraz jak <b>przedmioty formowane są wobec zastanego otoczenia</b>.
Prowadzę ostatnio kwerendę dotyczącą kultury materialnej, w wyniku której
powstają teksty do publikacji. Skupiam się przede wszystkim na czysto
praktycznych aspektach obiektów użytkowych w relacji wobec bardziej
metaforycznych kontekstów oraz pierwotnej <b>potrzeby kontaktu z materią fizyczną</b>.
</p>
<p>W chwili obecnej inwestuję swój czas, energię i środki
materialne w zrealizowanie tego projektu, ale wciąż potrzebne jest mi wsparcie
by go skończyć, a rezultaty móc zaprezentować szerszej publiczności.
Projekt został wybrany przez ośrodek artystyczny <i><b>La Fragua/The Forge</b> </i>prowadzący międzynarodowy program rezydencji
artystycznych zlokalizowany w hiszpańskiej miejscowości Belalcázar.
Zaproponowano mi dwumiesięczny pobyt twórczy w tym znanym ośrodku artystycznym
mieszczącym się w piętnastowiecznych zabudowaniach klasztornych konwentu Świętej
Klary. Piękne miejsce oraz twórcze środowisko! Towarzystwo związane z <i>La Fragua</i> asystuje artystom w procesie
tworzenia oraz pomaga nawiązać kontakty z lokalnymi artystami i rzemieślnikami.
Takie możliwości zdecydowanie pomogłyby rozwinąć projekt <i>Narzędzia abstrakcji</i> . Podczas moich poprzednich pobytów w
Hiszpanii nauczyłam się jak stymulujące i kreatywne środowisko można spotkać w
tym kraju. Zmiana miejsca oraz cisza otoczenia z pewnością pozwolą mi skupić
się na nowych pracach. Moim celem jest stworzenie serii rzeźb, we współpracy z
rzemieślnikami z okolic Belalcázar oraz używając lokalnie pozyskanych materiałów (drzewo
oliwne, glina, włókna naturalne, metal).</p>
<p>Środki, jakie potrzebuję zebrać pokryją <b>koszty związane z samą
rezydencją</b> (zakwaterowanie i opłaty administracyjne) oraz <b>transport do
Belalcázar</b>. Będę bardzo wdzięczna za wsparcie mojej kampanii. <b>Przyłączając się
do projektu, staniesz się zarazem mecenasem oraz kolekcjonerem sztuki!</b>
Wszystkie przedmioty, jakie oferuję w kampanii (perki) to prace, które ostatnio
wykonałam lub takie, które powstaną podczas mojego pobytu w <i>La Fragua</i>. W trakcie trwania rezydencji
przygotuję <b>materiały do drukowanego katalogu-zina</b>, wydanego w limitowanej edycji. Elegancko zaprojektowany katalog będzie zawierał teksty (eseje) oraz ilustracje (szkice i fotografie) dokumentujące moje działania w temacie metaforycznych
aspektów kultury materialnej. Po zakończeniu rezydencji będę się starała o wystawę
powstałych prac. Zostaniecie zaproszeni! </p>

Photography is my life. It's a part of me. It is my mission to try to heal the world, to show how beautiful it is, to help open eyes, to love, to remind people how it feels to look at things without judgment.

This is my first chance to start something big. To spread the word. To open eyes.
                                                              www.ZivSade.com  
I am a self-taught photographer, from a small village in the northern part of Israel.

I started to discover photography when i was only 10 years old and quickly became my middle school main event cinematographer.

At the age of 14 I discovered my first film camera and it was love at first sight.



At the age of 24, I opened ""The Ziv Sade Studio” that quickly became an “institute” and a creative space for people to express themselves as well as a home for events and some of the most amazing and controversial imagery that Israel had ever seen.














At that time I discovered my true sexuality, became the most influential photographer in the local gay community and became involved in raising awareness for the LGBTQ community and minorities.


My name was well known in the local photography industry as one of the busiest photographers in town, and I had the privilege of having some of the the most interesting and famous public figures nationally and internationally ( politicians, musicians and actors) in front of my camera.


My emphasis was the connection between people and emotion. I strive to portray an emotion or a story in every portrait i take.

When Madonna posted my peace photo ( Portraying  A Jewish man & Muslim man kissing) I realized new how much influence art have.

<p>I use this visual language to
challenge assumptions about the natural environment, to reinterpret the
grandeur of natural land forms, and to re-present this visual information laden
with power. </p>
<p>I develop my attachment to the
barrenness of rock and fragile lands, and show ambition by working in places of
sparse population. While humans are absent, the spectral presence of the viewer
who sees this land understands that it Is not ‘empty’, but rather filled with
the same elements that sustain all life. I am the recipient of many awards;

<b>My Campaign</b></p><p>
I have been invited among a select group of artists and scientists worldwide to
participate in The Arctic Circle Residency Programme in October 2016 for three
weeks around the remote and northern Archipelago of Svalbard.</p>
<p>I couldn’t be more excited for this opportunity
as not only is it a place that will deeply influence and enrich my practice,
it is also a place I have wanted to venture to for a long time because of the
unique landscape and impressive geological wonders. For three weeks the
other residents and I will sail together on an ice class barkentine tallship
exploring Svalbard, a High Arctic archipelago just ten degrees from the North Pole,
creating, collaborating, observing and documenting as we go.</p>
<p>This residency is incredibly
important to me as it is in Svalbard where the effects of progressive climate
change are the most apparent and where wildlife and the sea ice is
significantly under threat. It is a place of wonder yet fragility and I find it
important for my practice to record the shifting of the landscapes and the
effects that global warming is inflicting on the Arctic. </p>
<p>I aim to
record, document, and build up a large body of new drawings/ paintings, prints
and photographs all made on the voyage through the Arctic and all directly
connected to the place and what I observe whilst on the expedition. I hope to instill love for the
landscapes in people so they too can be inspired to conserve this place that is significant
to our future as a whole. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454265423/w2htayc6hzjvngh5dpkb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In addition to being a life-changing personal experience, this
trip holds untold potential for the enrichment and development of my work. My
whole art practice and key ideas are directly related to the atmosphere of
remote places, a visual documentation of the shifting of landscapes in the
north so being able to go on this expedition will provide me with the right

<br/></div>","IntroMy name is Ellis O´Connor and I´m
a visual artist working in painting, printmaking and photography from
Scotland. 
I use this visual language to
challenge assumptions about the natural environment, to reinterpret the
grandeur of natural land forms, and to re-present this visual information laden
with power. 
I develop my attachment to the
barrenness of rock and fragile lands, and show ambition by working in places of
sparse population. While humans are absent, the spectral presence of the viewer
who sees this land understands that it Is not ‘empty’, but rather filled with
the same elements that sustain all life. I am the recipient of many awards;
I exhibit my work consistently and internationally and have also been chosen
for a significant number of artist in residence programmes around the world. 
My Campaign
I have been invited among a select group of artists and scientists worldwide to
participate in The Arctic Circle Residency Programme in October 2016 for three
weeks around the remote and northern Archipelago of Svalbard.
I couldn’t be more excited for this opportunity
as not only is it a place that will deeply influence and enrich my practice,
it is also a place I have wanted to venture to for a long time because of the
unique landscape and impressive geological wonders. For three weeks the
other residents and I will sail together on an ice class barkentine tallship
exploring Svalbard, a High Arctic archipelago just ten degrees from the North Pole,
creating, collaborating, observing and documenting as we go.
This residency is incredibly
important to me as it is in Svalbard where the effects of progressive climate
change are the most apparent and where wildlife and the sea ice is
significantly under threat. It is a place of wonder yet fragility and I find it
important for my practice to record the shifting of the landscapes and the
effects that global warming is inflicting on the Arctic. 
I aim to
record, document, and build up a large body of new drawings/ paintings, prints
and photographs all made on the voyage through the Arctic and all directly
connected to the place and what I observe whilst on the expedition. I hope to instill love for the
landscapes in people so they too can be inspired to conserve this place that is significant
to our future as a whole. 
In addition to being a life-changing personal experience, this
trip holds untold potential for the enrichment and development of my work. My
whole art practice and key ideas are directly related to the atmosphere of
remote places, a visual documentation of the shifting of landscapes in the
north so being able to go on this expedition will provide me with the right
visual material for my work and go forward immensely with new creative work.
You can imagine how being immersed in that extreme
environment will impact the work that I create, expanding upon and evolving my
art practise work into something richer, informed by real visual experience. Here is a press release on my trip! http://www.dundee.ac.uk/news/2015/arctic-expedi...

<p><b>Help me make improvements to my Pottery teaching studio.</b><br/>The campaign was a great success and the studio got the required upgrades, It was well used throughout 2016 and kept busy with pottery sessions and classes. The winter months in this area are very quiet for passing trade and so if you wish to continue to support the studio through the lean times, you can do so by buying pottery from the <a href=""http://www.balnacra.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.balnacra.com</a> website or through this page. Many thanks !<br/>update 15th Feb 2016 - Target met - see end for details- STRETCH GOAL ADDED- THANKYOU!<br/><br/>I need to crowdfund to make some improvements in my ‘Pop Up Pottery’ teaching studio space. This would pay for storage containers, timber for make shelving units, some raw materials for glazes and promotional flyers.<br/><br/><b>Who am I ? and why a Pop Up Pottery studio?</b><br/>The Pop Up Pottery started last year. I've been working in North West Scotland as an artist, potter and teaching for nearly 30 years, but haven't had a pottery studio for a few years. I was juggling lots of jobs, including Firefighting - but a damaged right arm and other health problems meant I had to retire early from being a retained watch manager at the community Fire station. So I thought I'd try getting back into teaching pottery. For a temporary studio space I rented out an empty community owned historic former blacksmiths building as a ‘pop up Pottery’. </p>
<p><b>How the first year went.</b><br/>It needed a lot of work to stop the Smithy building flooding and to make it usable. I opened for Easter 2015, when tourists start to visit this beautiful and remote part of The Scottish Highlands. Quickly the Pop Up Pottery became very popular. People were buying my pots faster than I could make them. Visitors and locals alike were dropping in to have a go at pottery, booking group sessions, coming along as a family holiday activity and joining in with regular pottery classes. I started gathering more tools and equipment, working flat out and full time to look after and process everyone’s pottery, which I post onto them, when the pots are finished.</p>
<p><b>The challenges.</b><br/>I have been working with the building’s owners- a community charity- to find funds to install a better electricity supply, fix the roof leaks, to put in some better lighting, and to make the building usable throughout the winter by putting in some insulation. These will be costly but really help preserve the building in the longer term. Recently The clay and Pottery has been suffering frost and ice damage, in the winter there is virtually no passing trade, and It has also been too cold to have students in, and it has been tough going not being able to earn or make pots to sell during the busy summer months. Spring isn't far away though and i'm keen to get the studio more organised and improved quickly- as it will get busy with visitors again after Easter 2016. While i'm waiting to get the building work done, i need to be ready with fixtures and fittings, this is what i'm looking to crowdfund.</p>
<p><b>What your help will do</b>.<br/>Any amount below or above the target is going to be a great help. £20 will buy me some raw materials to mix up new glazes. £15 will get me some storage containers for glazes and slips. Most importantly I want to tidy up the clutter and have more space to store drying pottery. I would like to build bespoke ladder style shelving units that fit into the building, these will take heavier items like clay at the bottom and go up to into drying racks. If the funding allows, I will get some more flyers printed, and make some nice display shelves too. So many people enjoyed coming and trying pottery in 2015, I want to be able to take the studio to the next level, so more people can come and explore more techniques, with more ease and comfort. It's not just a business for me, it is about sewing the seeds of inspiration and creativity in others. Pottery is not something it is easy to try and set up at home, yet it is so enjoyable, so rewarding- it is wonderful to be able to provide facilities so that everyone can get the opportunity to try this exciting medium.</p>
<p>I hope you feel inspired to chip in and make a pledge in exchange for art and pottery, It will help me out so much, any amount small or large. The Pop Up Pottery Pilot year proved there is a demand for this sort of studio space, that people are willing to travel far and wide to come and have a go. The more funds I can invest the faster it will grow.<br/><br/><b>Find out more and shout it out!</b><br/>If you can't contribute but would like to help, please share and tell others about this campaign.

<p><b>UPDATE 15th Feb 2016</b><br/>It's been incredible ! We've made the target already- I have been so moved by the support. Thankyou all so much. What next?<br/>I'm adding a <b> STRETCH GOAL</b><br/>an extra <b>£100</b> on top of the £600 already raised will allow me to buy some concrete floor sealant to stop horrible wheeze making dust going everywhere everytime I sweep up. I'll do some tests, It should cost around £70.<br/>I will also get some stove black paint and some fire cement to plug up the holes where smoke comes out of the wood stove....and if possible a bag or two of regular cement to help repoint the walls.<br/><br/>Thankyou !</p>

<p>Lately, you hear so much in the news about artists being displaced from their homes and workspaces. Let's change that narrative! Artists are a resourceful species!  I was reluctant at first to be among those needing to move all the way to the North Bay to get affordable space. To my surprise, life in Vallejo has been a refreshing change of pace: quiet, distraction-free, and with a lively art scene. I'm still just a short drive from the people and the creative energy that inspire me and bring me joy. </p>
<p>The Bay Area is where my creativity really took root and I began to see how an artist might not just survive, but thrive. It hasn't been easy. There have been tears shed here and there, but it's all been worth it. I give so much credit to the incredible community and irrepressible scene. I have a symbiotic relationship with lovers of art and I feel like every piece of art I create is a team effort. I'm so grateful for all of my teammates!</p>

<p>I'm excited to make t-shirts with society6! Here's an example of what one will look like. These premium quality American Apparel all-over print shirts feature original art from seam to seam. The cotton-soft 100% polyester wicks moisture and maintains a rich color throughout. All over print tees are unisex fit, so women should make size selections accordingly and order a minimum of one size smaller. Please Note: Every shirt is uniquely produced using a sublimation process that can create anomalies in some areas, typically under the arm, that leaves small portions of fabric white.</p>

<p></p>
</div></div>","I've been an artist my whole life, with about two decades of work in painting, digital art, graphic design and sculptural installations in my professional portfolio. I show whenever I can at festivals and art events, and here in Vallejo I'm hosting an open studio about once a month. Selling art is one of the main ways I'm supporting myself right now. Even with all of that going on, like most artists, more that half of the work I do is unpaid. I still bite my fingernails in between gigs and sales, wondering if the rent will be covered next month. I want to keep contributing to the color and vibrancy of Bay Area culture. I want my art to keep brightening the homes of appreciative people. This campaign is to gather resources to help make that happen. One part of the vision for making my studio a success involves creating small, affordable prints to offer studio visitors. While my larger canvas prints are made through a high-end production house in Berkeley, it would be wonderful for me to have my own printer to make smaller prints, so I can easily control quality and keep the retail price reasonable. A successful campaign will pay for a high-quality printer, archival inks, and fine art grade paper, plus packaging materials and shipping costs to start production and send out prints in time for the holidays. I would be so excited to help you with your Xmas gift shopping!Years ago I was crushed when hundreds of dollars worth of my in-studio made prints were lost in transit from a show overseas. In the aftermath, I never really had the time or the means to replace them. I'm finally feeling like I'm ready to start over.


Lately, you hear so much in the news about artists being displaced from their homes and workspaces. Let's change that narrative! Artists are a resourceful species!  I was reluctant at first to be among those needing to move all the way to the North Bay to get affordable space. To my surprise, life in Vallejo has been a refreshing change of pace: quiet, distraction-free, and with a lively art scene. I'm still just a short drive from the people and the creative energy that inspire me and bring me joy. 
The Bay Area is where my creativity really took root and I began to see how an artist might not just survive, but thrive. It hasn't been easy. There have been tears shed here and there, but it's all been worth it. I give so much credit to the incredible community and irrepressible scene. I have a symbiotic relationship with lovers of art and I feel like every piece of art I create is a team effort. I'm so grateful for all of my teammates!
Prints for most of the donation perks will be made by me, in my North Bay studio, with the brand new printer you'll help fund. I have a brand new digital painting, titled the Breakout Archetype, that I've just launched as a very special incentive to contribute.

<h3>The Zephyr and Me...</h3>
<p>Hello, My name is Dalton Bissell. I am an artist from the Pacific Northwest of the United States with a passion for both kinetic and utilitarian art. Spinning tops are my latest fascination since they are in motion and quite useful at the same time. Myself and many others carry small fiddler objects to help pass the time, relieve stress, and keep our wandering minds at bay. The Zephyr keeps my attention easily, spinning for how ever long I want and mesmerizing me with its unending dance. Gentle breaths of air keep it spinning while allowing me a chance to take a deep breath.  Now that's something that people often forget to do... take a deep breath and relax because it is good for you! That's right, the Zephyr is good for you. Take a look.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What exactly is it?</h3>
<p>-Air assisted spinning top, you blow down it spins faster.</p>
<p>-Stainless Steel alloy, it's durable and looks impressive.</p>
<p>-Grade 25 Stainless Steel Ball Bearing, it's a smooth spin.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The main obstacle is to make sure they all work properly. Accuracy is important with any spinning top, so each top will be tested to ensure it's spin.
