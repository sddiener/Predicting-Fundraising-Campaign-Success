</b></h3><b>What
is Endometriosis?</b><p></p>
<p>Endometriosis is a chronic disease
affecting 176 million women worldwide and 1 in 10 girls and women in the U.S. It
is present when tissue similar to that of the lining of the uterus is found in
other parts of the body, often causing chronic, severe pain and complications such as
cysts and infertility. There is no confirmed cause or cure, and many women
go undiagnosed for years, being told it’s “all in your head” or just a “bad
period.”</p>
<p><b>What
is ENDOME?</b></p>
<p>I was diagnosed with endometriosis 10
years ago. As a poet, I took to exploring my symptoms and medical treatment through
writing. Seven years later I ended up with a long poetic manuscript that had led me on a deep, transformative psychological journey. Yet I still
felt my work was unfinished. I had a strong desire to share my experience with
others and to raise awareness for this insidious yet often unacknowledged
disease, so I teamed up with visual and video artists, musicians, actors, and an
amazing director to make an experimental multimedia performance for the

$2,000 to install speakers/sound system and sound insulating materials
$5,000 for point of sales equipment, office supplies, signage and working capital for the studio

    The Impact One thing that we've realized in the past year is the impact that dance has on people.  We have helped young dancers gain confidence and a sense of accomplishment We have helped adults become part of a dance community that is supportive, healthy, friendly and encouraging. And we've helped create several special memories in our clients whether it was making their wedding day, birthday or their evening after work a little bit brighter.    Risks & Challenges The biggest challenge in finding a dance home is finding a space that caters to the unique needs of a dance studio.  It needs to be in a space that allows for the sound of music playing, have an open floor layout with high ceilings for jumping and available parking.  This has been a challenge to find but we have located a space that we feel would be a perfect fit if we can raise enough money before it is leased by another tenant.

And played the piano in the original performance.Speaking of the original performance, it can be viewed in it's entirety on YouTube here: Family Portrait.The cast of our Family Portrait includes some familiar faces to the DC theatre scene as well as some incredible up and coming talents: Harv Lester and Katie McManus as Sam and Mary, the parents, and Kristin Cardinal, Madeline Cuddihy, and RJ Pavel as their children, Elly, Jo, and Tom. The DC Music Theatre Workshop's home is Lincoln Temple UCC, a beautiful church in the historic Logan Circle/Shaw neighborhood of Northwest Washington DC. Lincoln Temple has a strong musical history and has hosted such internationally important artists as Roland Hayes and Leontyne Price in recitals. We are so proud and honored to continue this tradition and bring high quality (and affordable) performances to the neighborhood.All performances at the DC Music Theatre Workshop will be pay what you can. Your donations will help bring theatre to people who wouldn't normally be able to afford it.There are many other interesting new works that we plan on bringing to DC, and your generous support will help us become a new voice in DC Theatre.Thank you so much for your support,Zach RobertsDirector of Family Portrait and founder of the DC Music Theatre Workshop",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The Edinburgh Fringe Festival is not only the largest theatre festival in the world, it is also the longest-running theatre festival, begun in 1947. The Edinburgh Fringe draws audiences and press from all over the globe. Thus, a participant in the festival may receive reviews from a variety of sources, get exposure to international spectators and even be invited to perform at future venues who are looking for programming on a worldwide level. <i>Reclaiming Vietnam</i> has been in its infant stages, and is now ready for critics’ reviews and for its subject matter to hold the eye of the media.

We have been invited to represent the arts of Germany in China through their long lasting partnership from Nov 26th until Dec 3rd in a very big cultural festival on the beautiful island of Hainan! Everything in China is covered, from hotels to local transport and exhibitions. What remains to make this fantastic opportunity come true is the coverage of the flights, Visa, rehearsal, costumes and instrumentation. The budget needed it's not huge and we are sure that with your precious support we can make this happen for real! Plus we have many many things planned for the future... and we would love you to be totally involved in them! We believe in the power of exchanging, where you and us work on a common goal. We are truly honored for the invitation already. Let's try to make it unforgettable, unique and REAL... GUT REACTION go international, thanks to you. Marco &amp; Giulia </div><div><br/></div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>For what regard the China opportunity we are supported by U.D.K (<a href=""http://www.udk-berlin.de/sites/content/themen/aktuelles/index_ger.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.udk-berlin.de/sites/content/themen/a...</a>) through Fiake e.V. (<a href=""http://www.fiake.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.fiake.org/</a>). Everything is very well organized and luckily enough once the budget goal has been reached the project will become a reality. By funding this project, even in the remote possibility that China will not happen, you will always be sure the funds will allow the creation of something special, buying of instrumentation and tons of hours of research in the rehearsal space to donate you an always growing and unforgettable performance! Non mainstream projects like this need constant support to stay alive, research new ideas and tools of expression, pay collaborators and guests, and so forth. At the moment we are working on the creation of a new pièce called Whole-Blinded. We could have never made it without you and that is why our thank will never be enough! </div><div><br/></div><div><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Other Ways You Can Help</span></div><div> <p>Any kind of support is truly appreciated!

We have been invited to represent the arts of Germany in China through their long lasting partnership from Nov 26th until Dec 3rd in a very big cultural festival on the beautiful island of Hainan! Everything in China is covered, from hotels to local transport and exhibitions. What remains to make this fantastic opportunity come true is the coverage of the flights, Visa, rehearsal, costumes and instrumentation. The budget needed it's not huge and we are sure that with your precious support we can make this happen for real! Plus we have many many things planned for the future... and we would love you to be totally involved in them! We believe in the power of exchanging, where you and us work on a common goal. We are truly honored for the invitation already. Let's try to make it unforgettable, unique and REAL... GUT REACTION go international, thanks to you. Marco & Giulia 
    Risks & Challenges  For what regard the China opportunity we are supported by U.D.K (http://www.udk-berlin.de/sites/content/themen/a...) through Fiake e.V. (http://www.fiake.org/). Everything is very well organized and luckily enough once the budget goal has been reached the project will become a reality. By funding this project, even in the remote possibility that China will not happen, you will always be sure the funds will allow the creation of something special, buying of instrumentation and tons of hours of research in the rehearsal space to donate you an always growing and unforgettable performance! Non mainstream projects like this need constant support to stay alive, research new ideas and tools of expression, pay collaborators and guests, and so forth. At the moment we are working on the creation of a new pièce called Whole-Blinded. We could have never made it without you and that is why our thank will never be enough! Other Ways You Can Help Any kind of support is truly appreciated! Word of mouth! x",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Welcome to the launching pad of our new musical - Oink!  After two years of collaboration and almost 20 years in the making, we are thrilled to be on the brink of bringing this brilliant, touching, clever musical to the stage!  
Here's a little background:
The book and lyrics for Oink! were written almost 20 years ago by Deb Hollander, along with another full musical and several children's books.  They were neatly tucked away and not brought out again until Deb, who by then had been diagnosed with a progressive disease, was too ill to keep working.   In 2013, she showed them to Jen Rodgers, who loved them immediately!  Jen brought the musical to her professional network, including dear friend and composer, Clif Hardin.  Clif was just as excited about the material and, besides, he had just had a conversation with his dog, Piper, wondering if he would ever have the chance to branch out into musical theater.  (Literally, a week before Jen showed up with the script!)
We three got to work.  Clif wrote a beautiful, intricate, exciting score, and we performed a staged reading of our first completed draft about a year ago.  It received a ""leaping ovation"" and we were off!  Over this past year the show developed in big leaps and bounds with some new songs and plot twists, a new name, and an insanely talented creative team that came on board with us. 


We've worked hard to have something to bring to the stage and to Deb, and we have done it!  Read on to learn what we plan to do and how this campaign will get us there!


Prepare for Take-off!



This Indie GoGo campaign is timed to culminate in three semi-staged performances of Oink!   They will take place at the Black Box Theatre of Silver Spring on October 17-18, and we hope you will come!


These performances are the pre-cursors to both taking the show to festival performances in 2016, and introducing it to theaters across the country, in the hopes of finding a company to fully conceive it.  We have thrown our hearts and talents into it full force and fronted the funding thus far, and now we need help to take it to these next levels.
To do all of this, we really need $15,000.  
$5,000 of that amount covers the development of the show thus far - our demo recordings, website and the expenses of the first staged reading.
$5,000 more covers the cost of the semi-staged production in October - the rental of a proper theater and the basic travel expenses of our actors (from New York and DC).
That makes up the $10,000 that is our funding goal for this campaign.  (Asking for the whole hog just felt a little too piggy!)  If we raise more than our goal, here's what happens:

Pipe Dream or Pig Dream? The world of theatre is full of dreamers - creators and performers who go all-in on stories that capture their hearts, and theater-goers who want their heart to be captured.  Yes, we have a story here that we believe is all-in worthy!  And, more than that, we have a team that can make it happen.  And that takes us from pipe dream to pig dream.

<p><strong><u>Neat! Now tell me more about the Shakespeare-In-Hospitals Project!</u></strong></p>
<p>The Shakespeare-In-Hospitals
Project engages members of the health-care sector of Toronto who are in healing
or transitional processes. It provides psychosocial support in health-care
facilities and communities facing high turnover rates and isolation to increase
flexible communication and seamless patient/client care. Classical and modern
theatre practice is employed with discussion, interactive exploration, and
performance as tools to break down physical, economic, and social barriers in
these locales.</p>
<p><strong>The SiH Project is founded off
of 3 Principles:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Relief</strong>:</p>
<p>Often people in hospitals,
retirement homes and hospices are restricted to a bed or a floor or a ward. We
offer a distraction from their healing and transitional processes, to bring
them out of their situation and into one that they can control and interact
with by using clown-tactics in our interactive scenes and telling them stories
and sonnets that they can either relate to or escape into.</p>
<p><strong>Accessibility</strong>:</p>
<p>While most hospitals have
recreational therapy programming, accessibility is always an issue, and the
amount of interaction patients or clients can receive in these programs is
constantly fluctuating based on their conditions. </p>
<p>We provide scenes, monologues,
and choral pieces for performances and interactions by performing in various
mediums including: Private Room (or One-on-One) Format, Open-Space Format, and
Staged Format. This allows us to tailor performances to any environment or
location for any patient or client regardless of their condition. </p>
<p><strong>Community Engagement:</strong></p>
<p>Communities exist in hospitals
too! Whether it is among patients, their families, or the staff. It is easy to
forget this when focusing on treatment, or transitioning back into everyday
life. When patients engage with their hospital/health care facility’s
community, they provide themselves with more opportunities to emotionally cope
with the treatment they are receiving. SiH further supports this dynamic by giving
a new and innovative way to interact and bond with their community, even if it
is only for a short time and allow them to have a uniquley positive experience
during their stay</p>
<p>This year we are also extending
the artistic conversation to engage both members of the Health Care and Arts
Sectors by showcasing the project at three different venues throughout the
process. Throughout these showcases, we will be sharing our own stories and
experiences, and facilitating a creative discussion among the involved
communities to encourage further future interaction beyond the program.</p>

too! Whether it is among patients, their families, or the staff. It is easy to
forget this when focusing on treatment, or transitioning back into everyday
life. When patients engage with their hospital/health care facility’s
community, they provide themselves with more opportunities to emotionally cope
with the treatment they are receiving. SiH further supports this dynamic by giving
a new and innovative way to interact and bond with their community, even if it
is only for a short time and allow them to have a uniquley positive experience
during their stay
This year we are also extending
the artistic conversation to engage both members of the Health Care and Arts
Sectors by showcasing the project at three different venues throughout the
process. Throughout these showcases, we will be sharing our own stories and
experiences, and facilitating a creative discussion among the involved
communities to encourage further future interaction beyond the program.
Previous facilities have
included:
CAMH
Toronto Western Hospital
Toronto General Hospital
Sunnybrook Health Centre
Tapestry at Village Gate West
Princess Margaret Hospital
Lodge
Sick Kids Hospital
Lord Dufferin Senior’s Centre
Adelaide Women’s Resource

<h3>Past Successes<br/>
</h3> <p> We've been working together off and on for nearly 8 years. We started collaborating on <i></i><a href=""http://www.kissmetheplay.com/#!timeline/cee5"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kiss Me or Cut Off My Head </a>in 2012, and have work-shopped the play several times getting it ready for a NYC production. </p>
<p><i><b>Timeline:</b></i><br/></p> <ul>
<li>September 2012: Fully staged site-specific workshop of <i>Kiss Me or Cut off My Head </i> at 
Pristine Beach in Palawan, Philippines. The workshop was focused on creating a visual theatrical experience 
for viewers whose primary language was not English.<br/>
</li>
<li>Spring and Summer 2014: Brooke interviewed survivors of rape in American and Kenya and wrote a new adaptation of the script, incorporating these interviews.</li>
<li>November 2014: Workshop of a new adaptation incorporating audio and video interviews 
with survivors of sexual assault in the US and Kenya. Presented at Sarah
 Lawrence College. <br/>
</li>
<li>January 2015: Pittsburgh workshop performance of new adaptation in partnership with Chatham University at <a href=""http://most-wantedfineart.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Most Wanted Fine Art</a>. This workshop was free and open to the public. Donations were accepted for <a href=""http://www.shofco.org/project/margarets-safe-place"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Margaret's Safe Place.</a> The audience was packed, standing room only, and the response was very encouraging. </li>
</ul>
<p><i><b>Quotes from the workshops:</b></i></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Sarah Lawrence Workshop: <b>One of our goals is to educate about rape culture</b>. After the workshop, a student came up to us and said, <i>""I've been to four required seminars on sexual assault and I learned more today, watching this play, than I did in all of them put together.""</i><br/>
</li>
<li>Pittsburgh Workshop: <b>Another goal is that survivors who see the show will feel less alone.</b> After this workshop, a young man came up to me, in tears, and said, ""I can't thank you enough for this play. I'm a survivor and it means so much to me."" <br/>

 Kiss Me or Cut Off My Head is a collaboration between theatre artists 
Brooke M. Haney and Chris Carcione.  A beautiful play adapted from poetry about Medusa.
Confronts Rape Culture in America and Kenya.
 Raises money and awareness for Margaret's Safe Place.  We believe in the power of theater to change the world and transform lives. We are producing this play to encourage a much needed conversation about rape culture, to make survivors of sexual assault feel less alone and to help friends and family of survivors feel more equipped to support their loved ones. 


   What We Need 
 $12,500 for performance space:  Our largest expense in NYC is paying for the performance space. $12,500 would cover the cost of one week of tech and a four week run. 


Stretch Goals:
 $15,500 would cover the cost of two additional weeks of rehearsal in a studio space.
 $16,500 covers the cost of re-shooting some of the video of that we use in the show.
$19,600 allows for lights, sound, costumes and projections!
As we reach these, we'll start to list other stretch goals for you. 

Kiss Me or Cut Off My Head is a sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a 
non-profit arts service organization. Contributions for the charitable 
purposes of Kiss Me or Cut Off My Head must be made payable to 
“Fractured Atlas” only and are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by
 law.
    The Impact Kiss Me or Cut Off My Head is aimed at the following:  Using theater to foster a conversation about rape culture in America. Helping survivors of sexual assault to feel less alone. Equipping friends and families of survivors to better support their loved ones.
Raising money and awareness for Margaret's Safe Place.

Past Successes
  We've been working together off and on for nearly 8 years. We started collaborating on Kiss Me or Cut Off My Head in 2012, and have work-shopped the play several times getting it ready for a NYC production. 
Timeline: 
September 2012: Fully staged site-specific workshop of Kiss Me or Cut off My Head  at 
Pristine Beach in Palawan, Philippines. The workshop was focused on creating a visual theatrical experience 
for viewers whose primary language was not English.

Spring and Summer 2014: Brooke interviewed survivors of rape in American and Kenya and wrote a new adaptation of the script, incorporating these interviews.
November 2014: Workshop of a new adaptation incorporating audio and video interviews 
with survivors of sexual assault in the US and Kenya. Presented at Sarah
 Lawrence College. 

January 2015: Pittsburgh workshop performance of new adaptation in partnership with Chatham University at Most Wanted Fine Art. This workshop was free and open to the public. Donations were accepted for Margaret's Safe Place. The audience was packed, standing room only, and the response was very encouraging. 

Quotes from the workshops:


Sarah Lawrence Workshop: One of our goals is to educate about rape culture. After the workshop, a student came up to us and said, ""I've been to four required seminars on sexual assault and I learned more today, watching this play, than I did in all of them put together.""

Pittsburgh Workshop: Another goal is that survivors who see the show will feel less alone. After this workshop, a young man came up to me, in tears, and said, ""I can't thank you enough for this play. I'm a survivor and it means so much to me.""

discovered one of the girls of the trio to going to the studio every day
as the girls worked with various industry producers to performing at <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">various industry showcases to making
the phone calls to the record labels to shop the deal until the girls all
decided to go their separate ways and with Casting experience and Coaching

ABOUT THE TRUTH 

We would like
to introduce you to an amazing play that not only entertains, empowers, and
inspires the audience, but one that sends a lesson to the community about
reconciliation in love and relationships. 
The play also touches on topics related to the importance of friendships,
marriage, healthy sexual behaviors, and practices. It educates our youth and
others in the community about health awareness, specifically given attention
towards the HIV/Aids epidemic, domestic violence, and homelessness, employment,
and relevant social issues. In addition to relational and health matters, the
story also provides business education.
The main theme
or central point of the story is about exercising forgiveness and redemption in
relationships and most of all communicating with others by telling
“The Truth”

We want to bring you an experience and a message to change your life that you can carry with you for life. We want to not only Educate you and Empower you but Entertain you and most importantly share with you ""The Truth.""



“The Truth Stage Play” will bring awareness to Domestic Violence,  Mental Health, Marriage and Divorce, Homelessness, Health Awareness, Entrepreneurship and Unemployment and other social issues that affect our communities. 
This Stage Play is for the entire community and we need your support to help reach and touch lives.  




Quote from Meek- ""Having started
out in the business as solely a talent, I recognize the importance of
having a door of opportunity to showcase that talent. Now after formerly being
one of the managers of a girl group ""One Luv"" in 2004 where she
discovered one of the girls of the trio to going to the studio every day
as the girls worked with various industry producers to performing at various industry showcases to making
the phone calls to the record labels to shop the deal until the girls all
decided to go their separate ways and with Casting experience and Coaching
young actors Meek says, ""I realize that I always want to work with talent and see
them reach their full potential and as I continue to create and pursue my
dreams in Entertainment/The Arts, I will also be one that continues to create opportunities for others in
my quest as I remain ""Meek"" in my mission.""

In addition to her enviable ability to choose just the right music and fill it with meaningful movement, her work is blessedly free of gimmicks or self-indulgence. Claudia knows the value of not over-extending her ideas, so that after each piece we are left wanting more."" —Oberon's Grove (read the full review)
WHAT IS CLAUDIA SCHREIER & COMPANY?CS&C — originally a one-night-only event that extended to two  performances due to overwhelming demand — was a year in the making, featuring dancers from companies including New York City Ballet, American Ballet Theatre, and Dance Theatre of Harlem and world-class composers and artists.The performance featured five ballets choreographed by Ms. Schreier, including 3 world premieres:
Almost Morning, set to an original score composed for Ms. Schreier by multi-Emmy Award winning composer Jeff Beal (House of Cards) and performed by a live piano & string quartetVigil, a pas de deux to sacred choral music by Tomás Luis de Victoria and Sergei Rachmaninoff and performed surrounded onstage by 20-member choir TapestryPulse, a driving full-company work set to Dutch composer Douwe Eisenga's electrifying Piano Concerto: I.The performance also featured new productions of Anomie, a 2010 ACDFA Gala Selection, and Harmonic, winner of the 2014 Breaking Glass Project, set to another thrilling score by Mr. Eisenga.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>The recently created Long Island-based <i>Tomorrow’s Classics Theatre Company (TCTC) </i>is dedicated to solely producing cutting-edge new works.  Co-Founders, Debi Toni, a singer/songwriter, performer, teacher, and musical director; and Cindi Sansone-Braff, an award-winning playwright, director, author, entertainer, and psychic, truly believe that these innovative new plays are destined to become future theatre classics.</p><p>Their first project, <i>Beethoven's Promethean Concerto in C Minor WoO,</i> written by co-founder, Cindi Sansone-Braff, brings to the south shore suburbs of Long Island the kind of groundbreaking theatre that you’d only expect to find in London, Vienna, or New York City. </p><p>Following Aristotle’s principles of three unities, this Four Movement music drama takes place on August 6,1826, the fateful day when Beethoven's beloved nephew shot himself in the head. Beethoven, forced to review the soul record of his life, ponders the universal question that has plagued him, Hamlet, and all of humankind since the dawn of time: ""To be or not to be?""  Yes, for any soul-searching being, this is always the question.</p><p>Your contribution will help us commemorate, on August 5, 2017, the 191st Anniversary Eve of that earth-shattering day.  An Anniversary encore performance will take place on, Sunday, August 6, 2017.  By the way, these synchronistic dates were not picked by human design, but were divinely-timed by the powers that be -- stunning both co-founders!</p><p>After the Saturday night World Premiere performance, there will be an informative question-and-answer session. </p><p><b>Why Was This Play Created in the First Place?</b></p><p>Cindi wrote this play after seeing the movie <i>Immortal Beloved</i>.  Although she had been a working psychic/medium for years, she'd never had the experience of having any famous deceased person channel thorough her.  All through the movie she kept getting messages from the Other Side telling her things like, “They tampered with facts.”  “This isn't true.  You can look it up for yourself.” She soon realized that the messages were coming from Beethoven himself. Yes, she was awestruck, since she knew very little about the man or even about his music, and she had no idea why he would come to her or what he wanted her to do with this information. This was back  1995, and Cindi wasn't computer literate, and she couldn't just go and <i>Google</i> the facts.  She had to peruse through a pile of books written about Beethoven to fact-check -- and lo and behold, she learned that there was a great deal of tampering with the facts concerning Beethoven's life throughout this movie. She also discovered that Beethoven was greatly concerned that his biographers would not tell the truth about his life.  It was his heartfelt desire that whatever might be written about him and his life, must be written with an absolute adherence to facts and truth, even if these truths might cast a dark shadow upon other people or even upon himself.

Beethoven, forced to review the soul record of his life, ponders the universal question that has plagued him, Hamlet, and all of humankind since the dawn of time: ""To be or not to be?""  Yes, for any soul-searching being, this is always the question.Your contribution will help us commemorate, on August 5, 2017, the 191st Anniversary Eve of that earth-shattering day.  An Anniversary encore performance will take place on, Sunday, August 6, 2017.  By the way, these synchronistic dates were not picked by human design, but were divinely-timed by the powers that be -- stunning both co-founders!After the Saturday night World Premiere performance, there will be an informative question-and-answer session. Why Was This Play Created in the First Place?Cindi wrote this play after seeing the movie Immortal Beloved.  Although she had been a working psychic/medium for years, she'd never had the experience of having any famous deceased person channel thorough her.  All through the movie she kept getting messages from the Other Side telling her things like, “They tampered with facts.”  “This isn't true.  You can look it up for yourself.” She soon realized that the messages were coming from Beethoven himself. Yes, she was awestruck, since she knew very little about the man or even about his music, and she had no idea why he would come to her or what he wanted her to do with this information. This was back  1995, and Cindi wasn't computer literate, and she couldn't just go and Google the facts.  She had to peruse through a pile of books written about Beethoven to fact-check -- and lo and behold, she learned that there was a great deal of tampering with the facts concerning Beethoven's life throughout this movie. She also discovered that Beethoven was greatly concerned that his biographers would not tell the truth about his life.  It was his heartfelt desire that whatever might be written about him and his life, must be written with an absolute adherence to facts and truth, even if these truths might cast a dark shadow upon other people or even upon himself. Beethoven just wanted anyone who wrote anything about him to just tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth about him, and this is what Cindi has tried to do.  She also had to fill in the dots, as well as connect many dots, to figure out some of the more “mysterious” aspects of his life.The overwhelming majority of his biographers have been men and they have failed to adequately understand the drama and trauma of his childhood and early life, and how these events came to  influence his music and his actions.  Cindi has succeeded in her efforts to bring a deep understanding of the heart and soul of this musical genius to the stage.By becoming one of our Angel's you can help Beethoven's dying wish --  to have someone tell the truth of his existence --  come true.  Beethoven was a great fan of the Greek classical plays, and Cindi believes that he would be pleased with her decision to follow Aristotle’s principles of three unities in Beethoven’s Promethean Concerto in C Minor WoO and to incorporate a Greek Chorus to help tell the story of his life. Furthermore, your generous contribution can help us make this a first-rate theatrical production: a worthy tribute to the man, the myth, the music. Our greatest hope is that this scaled-down production can be a vehicle that will generate interest from potential producers, theatres, or other theatre professionals who believe in this play and who will want to see it have a fully-realized production in the near future.What We NeedThe $3500.00 will help us pay for the scoring of the music.  This is an arduous task since most of the musical pieces being used in this production need to be scored down for a solo piano.  For example: segments of the 3rd, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 9th symphonies are used throughout the play.  Beethoven’s mass Missa Solemnis and his opera Fidelio are also featured.  The funds will help pay for the two dozen musical scores needed for us to complete this project.We also need to pay for the rental of The Bacca Arts Center for rehearsal use and for the actual performances.We need funds to help with the set which takes place on the hilltop site known as the ruins of Rauhenstein in the quiet Helenenthal production.

<p>The production of my stage musical “The Rugger Buggers Bawdy Song Fest”, is a completed script or ""book"" in theatre parlance. It is based on the over 100 recorded songs I now have under licence. All are outrageous. The intent is a production of a 120 minute stage musical for global distribution and from which a DVD and a CD will be culled for global distribution at a later stage. </p>
<p>Other distribution potentials are stage productions of foreign language versions, a motion picture and a late night television series.  The Karaoke market is another area of distribution along with short clips for phones and tablets. Each song is a separate segment of stage action and lyrics</p>
<p>With your help I can get the Rugger Buggers on the road.  The intent is an audience deep into honking laughter, snorting giggles, bellows from the belly and rollicking hysteria with tears in the eyes. </p>
<p>AND...be assured that with the lyrics being very non-PC, an alternative clean version will be edited with an emission of my own personal sound effect of gas covering the vulgarities.</p>

A celebration of everything lyrical in the rugby world and beyond.After 40 years behind the camera and sometimes in front, the high point being the Cinematographer/Line Producer on the Academy Award winning film ""Genocide"",  where I brought the $3 million dollar film in under budget.       Orson Welles did the voice over commentary brilliantly and donated his fee. Reading excerpts of letters from the concentration camp victims was a tearful Elizabeth Taylor. It was a real buzz to get thanked from the Academy Award stage by my Executive Producer Rabbi Marvin Hier.                                                THE AGES OF MAN AND BOYI have produced hundreds of commercials, financed 3 short films and lectured on IMAX production and my 25 years of motion pictures in Hollywood. I have been involved in film and video in over 40 countries.  My stage musical is ""THE RUGGER BUGGERS BAWDY SONG FEST,"" which I am sure will amuse you because I know you have a great sense of humour, You must have to get this far past the video clip and the photo's of the old boy.Laughter is the driving force in my life; one gets it working with camera crews, actors and hanging out at rugby clubs for the choral delight of singing outrageous non-PC songs.  And yes, the beer and the laughter flowed and the ladies joined in for the gin and the sin.  My stage show “THE RUGGER BUGGERS BAWDY SONG FEST” is backed by the glorious and inebriated voices of Ron and the Rude Boys Choir...twenty West Country pub lads in fine form.  Their voices combined with the antics of the actors and singers on stage will make for an outrageous evening. Audience participation will be encouraged physically and vocally with video monitors screening the lyrics for the many Karaoke singalong moments.A GATHERING OF THE TROOPS ON THE FIRST “STAR WARS""Peter Shillingford. Director/Camera on “The Making of Star Wars”
The production of my stage musical “The Rugger Buggers Bawdy Song Fest”, is a completed script or ""book"" in theatre parlance. It is based on the over 100 recorded songs I now have under licence. All are outrageous. The intent is a production of a 120 minute stage musical for global distribution and from which a DVD and a CD will be culled for global distribution at a later stage. 
Other distribution potentials are stage productions of foreign language versions, a motion picture and a late night television series.  The Karaoke market is another area of distribution along with short clips for phones and tablets. Each song is a separate segment of stage action and lyrics
With your help I can get the Rugger Buggers on the road.  The intent is an audience deep into honking laughter, snorting giggles, bellows from the belly and rollicking hysteria with tears in the eyes. 
AND...be assured that with the lyrics being very non-PC, an alternative clean version will be edited with an emission of my own personal sound effect of gas covering the vulgarities.
PLEASE consider a donation, however small. We are intent on bringing a great deal more laughter into all of our lives.
And thanks for reading this far. Here comes the most fun I have had to date. This is the CASTING BRIEF REQUIREMENT as placed in The Stage Magazine.
ACTORS required who can sing and dance with improve experience and certainly no shame.
MAJOR KOCKSUP. Master of Ceremonies. (revolving celebrity role)                     An Edwardian toff of the 1900’s music hall, ready with wit and mockery, very much in control at his podium, except when he is not. Often interrupts to add to or subdue the chaos on stage. Encourages audience participation, teases the cast, and instigates the abuse of the actors and hecklers.
MIKE HUNT.
Lecherous choir leader, a sexually repressed psychotic druggie.
JOCK STRAP.                                                                 A Mad Scot, high kicking chorus  girl in a short kilt with no knickers.
REGGIE MENTAL.                                                              The Vicar. Flasher in a nun’s habit . Rock and roll queen.
IVOR BIGGAN.                                                               Cross dresser with rubber sex dolls, male and female.
JACK SOFALOT.                                                               Closet pervert groper, flamboyant self-abuse and voyeur tendencies.
CONNIE LINGUS.                                                             Nymphomaniac opera singer with a major drink problem.
WAYNE KERR.                                                                 Pole dancer and stripper, post operation so now  she is the lovely Jenny Talia.
ANNA KEY.                                                                   Punk rocker with a biker attitude.  Very capable with weapons.
JUSTIN YARMOUTH.                                                           Head Master of a Nazi swingers club.  Collector of ancient dildos.
ACTORS! We are still casting so apply!...I am trying to keep you employed!
The STAGE SETTINGS are simple.  A rugby club bar, a sofa bed, two screens for costume changes, a few rugby pennants, a piano or a 4 piece quartet, 
Once THE RUGGER BUGGERS BAWDY SONG FEST is produced on stage and videoed, the DVD and CD of the show will be offered at a minimal cost to theatre groups, amateur and professional, nationwide and global, for ten or more actors to create their low cost production in village hall or city theatre. 
LAUGHTER is the essence of one's life and the production team, actors and our supporters intend to make the whole world a happier place.
Choose your gifts and then please forwarded the link to your family, friends and enemies for their participation and donations. It would help if you could encourage whoever receives the link to forward it to their friends and enemies for further donations.My request to you is to donate and to enjoy your gifts, and many thanks.
I will be connecting with theatre groups worldwide as well as requesting participation from the over 2,000 rugby clubs in my data base. Other sports are being researched and will be contacted along with international agents, leagues and clubs. 
Rugby is alive and well in Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Italy, France, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, South America and the Far East.  The USA has just formed state wide leagues for both men and women. All will be approached.
Editorial material will be submitted to sports mags and relevant media.
A children's charity will receive a percentage of any income I receive from this project.

____________________________________________Wow, we are so humbled by the support and the generosity of the support for Willie and Me, which is a project that has meant so much to us.Thank you who have contributed to this, please consider sharing this with five of your friends... and for those of you folks who would still like to do so, you can do so now!During my research, I had the pleasure of meeting the lovely Mrs. Emmett Kelly - Lentz, who along with her daughters keep the legacy of Emmett alive.  I thought I'd share a picture of our visit. Thank you, and may all your days be circus days!____________________________________________DREAMS DO COME TRUESteve Woodburn ~ Brandextender's BlogMy passion for close to 20 years has been writing a Broadway play about America’s most iconic clown, Emmett Kelly, Sr. He rose to fame in an era long before computers, the Internet, social media, and email, portraying a sad-faced hobo character he named Weary Willie.His most famous routine was sweeping up a spotlight only to be startled by its reappearance, but eventually sweeping it into a smaller and smaller pool and putting it in his pocket or sweeping it under a rug.I’ve shared my vision with friends over the years and am sure most began to think of me as a Don Quixote character, forever tilting my pen at windmills I had no chance of reaching. And there were the dream killers, telling me how impossible it is to get a show produced anywhere, much less on Broadway.I persevered through it all and met a like-minded soul along the way named Jonathan Cerullo and together we’ve finally completed Willie and Me: The Emmett Kelly Story. We’re holding a reading this fall for a select group of producers and investors and if my dream finally comes to fruition, we’ll see our name in lights on Broadway.We’re also running an IndiGoGo campaign to raise money to fund the reading and while I hate asking people for money, making your dream a reality sometimes means going outside your comfort zone.I just posted a blog on this called ""Dreams Do Come True"" at https://brandextenders.com/2017/08/10/dreams-do-come-true/​​____________________________________________~* 25% FUNDED *~We hit a milestone today and are that much closer to our goal in“Gettin' this show on the road!”THANK YOU ~ OMG WE ARE OVERWHELMED!We are one step closer to seeing this dream become a reality. I want to share this picture when Stephen and I were in Sarasota, Florida discussing and researching the play, and had a lovely site visit with our dear friend and circus scholar, Brian Liddicoat at the Ringling Museum and the Historic Also Theater. It has always been our dream to premiere this show here so…SIDE SHOW BARKER(Follow spot snaps onto SIDESHOW BARKER than shifts to each individual)Ladies and Gentlemen, may I turn your attention to the following lovely contributors, for a heartfelt thank you shout out to Kyla, Ms. Judine, Dale, Carrie & Steve, Lee, Dulcie aka Kathleen, Wendy, Chip, Randall, Jack, Shari, Ellen, Adrian, Jim, Leslie (cough-cough), Diane, Paul & Sherry, Bruce Robert, and last, but certainly not least, mixlexia!(Thunderous applause are heard throughout) ____________________________________________Today is the day after the Eclipse and I am awed by this incredible event. While witnessing this communal experience I had a reflective moment and took a second to say thank you to Emmett Kelly whose memory and artistry we honor for “gifting” this to us.  I would like to follow-up this up with a thank you to our most recent contributors, Rosemarie, Cindy, Mel, Annie, Valerie, and Alex!Did you know that circus is an ancient art and can be traced back to the Egyptians? Thank you for bringing one of the stories from this ancient art form to life with your generous contribution to our project.  This has helped us get one step closer to realizing this play and from the bottom of our hearts, we can’t thank you enough!Jonathan & StephenPhotos:Eclipse 2017 By Jonathan CerulloCeramic Acrobat 900 - 500 BCE - The Greatest Shows on Earth, Linda Simon  ____________________________________________Jonathan Cerullo's Personal Pitch

It sold shortly after our production closed; <i>True West</i> in an empty storefront. A few months later that same space that sat empty for years, was rented and has been occupied ever since.</p><p><i><strong>We are dedicated to doing theatre that is thoughtful and relevant, visceral and organic, truthful and messy.</strong></i></p><p> </p><h2>Why Am I Asking?</h2><p>Since I started Urban Theater Project, there has been an influx of new theatre companies in the area. As a result, we took a hiatus to re-evaluate the kind of work we do and our place in the community.</p><p><i><strong>What we discovered is that it’s time for Leslie Charipar, seasoned theatre artist, and Urban Theater Project of Iowa, spry little theatre company that could, to focus on making new theatre.</strong></i></p><p> </p><h2>Why Am I Asking Now?</h2><p><strong><i>On June 4, 2015, I was diagnosed with breast cancer and then lung cancer and then thyroid cancer.</i></strong></p><p>In the last two years, I’ve had four surgeries, chemotherapy, radiation, radioactive iodine treatment, and blood clots in my brain. My two-year relationship disintegrated, menopause started early, Donald Trump was elected President, and I turned 50. </p><p>In a relatively short amount of time, I have had some of the most difficult, painful experiences of my life. And lately, I’ve found myself wondering why the cancers didn’t just kill me. Why keep going? If the reward for living through cancer is losing the love of my life and watching a crazy man dismantle everything that I think is good about this country, what is the fucking point?</p><p>I am currently unable to answer that question, so I’m going to drive around the country and ask people who I know and people who I don’t know why they get up in the morning and feed themselves and pay their bills and water their plants and get married and have babies and make plans.</p><p>And then I’m going to write about it.</p><p>And then I'm going to perform it.</p><p>I might even make a book out of it.</p><p>I can't think of a better way to launch the newly refocused Urban Theater Project of Iowa than to premier my new performance piece, <i>Reasons for Living</i>.</p><p> </p><h2>What’s In It For Me?</h2><p><strong><i>I am asking for your help to raise $100,000 by August 3.</i></strong></p><p>These funds will be used both for the immediate needs of <i>Reasons for Living</i> as well as looking toward Urban Theater Project of Iowa’s long-term sustainability.</p><p>The breakdown looks like this:</p><p><strong>$15000</strong> - purchase a new or used camper: <i>Reasons for Living</i> travel, future travel, temporary low-cost housing for local or visiting artists</p><p><strong>$5000</strong> - upgrade my vehicle to pull camper; assure that I/Urban Theater Project have reliable transportation for the long-term</p><p><strong>$3000</strong> - pay off medical bills</p><p><strong>$4500</strong> – pay mortgage ahead six months: ensure that my mortgage is paid during <i>Reasons for Living</i> travel and development; make it possible to keep my house so that I can continue to live and work as an artist in Cedar Rapids; provide temporary low-cost housing for local or visiting artists</p><p><strong>$72500</strong> – pay off my graduate student loans: to reduce my monthly bills and eliminate this obligation for my dad who co-signed on these loans; to take the pressure off of <i>Reasons for Living</i> and Urban Theater Project of Iowa to make money and pay my bills so that we can remain accessible to a wide variety of audiences; to contribute to the long-term financial health of Urban Theater Project so that we have to ask for money less and less.</p><p> </p><h2>What’s In It For You?</h2><p>Here’s what you can get for your generous contribution:</p><p><strong>$1-149</strong>                   </p><ul><li>1 ticket to the premiere of Reasons for Living</li></ul><p><strong>$150-499</strong>             </p><ul><li>2 tickets to the premiere of Reasons for Living</li></ul><p><strong>$500-999</strong>           </p><ul><li>4 tickets to the premiere of Reasons for Living</li></ul><p><strong>$1000-2499      </strong></p><ul><li>8 tickets to the premiere of Reasons for Living</li></ul><p><strong>$2500-4999      </strong></p><ul><li>10 tickets to the premiere of Reasons for Living</li></ul><p><b>$5000-9999      </b></p><ul>

</ul><p> </p><p> </p></div>","Who’s Asking?My name is Leslie Charipar, and I am a theatre artist in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.In 2001, I received an MFA in Acting at The Theatre School at DePaul University and spent the next few years working as an actor, director, and teacher in the Chicago area.In 2003, I came home and started Urban Theater Project of Iowa.We are a spry little theatre company that does edgy stuff in non-theatrical spaces: Rabbit Hole in the living room of a house for sale. It sold shortly after our production closed; True West in an empty storefront. A few months later that same space that sat empty for years, was rented and has been occupied ever since.We are dedicated to doing theatre that is thoughtful and relevant, visceral and organic, truthful and messy. Why Am I Asking?Since I started Urban Theater Project, there has been an influx of new theatre companies in the area. As a result, we took a hiatus to re-evaluate the kind of work we do and our place in the community.What we discovered is that it’s time for Leslie Charipar, seasoned theatre artist, and Urban Theater Project of Iowa, spry little theatre company that could, to focus on making new theatre. Why Am I Asking Now?On June 4, 2015, I was diagnosed with breast cancer and then lung cancer and then thyroid cancer.In the last two years, I’ve had four surgeries, chemotherapy, radiation, radioactive iodine treatment, and blood clots in my brain. My two-year relationship disintegrated, menopause started early, Donald Trump was elected President, and I turned 50. In a relatively short amount of time, I have had some of the most difficult, painful experiences of my life. And lately, I’ve found myself wondering why the cancers didn’t just kill me. Why keep going? If the reward for living through cancer is losing the love of my life and watching a crazy man dismantle everything that I think is good about this country, what is the fucking point?I am currently unable to answer that question, so I’m going to drive around the country and ask people who I know and people who I don’t know why they get up in the morning and feed themselves and pay their bills and water their plants and get married and have babies and make plans.And then I’m going to write about it.And then I'm going to perform it.I might even make a book out of it.I can't think of a better way to launch the newly refocused Urban Theater Project of Iowa than to premier my new performance piece, Reasons for Living. What’s In It For Me?I am asking for your help to raise $100,000 by August 3.These funds will be used both for the immediate needs of Reasons for Living as well as looking toward Urban Theater Project of Iowa’s long-term sustainability.The breakdown looks like this:$15000 - purchase a new or used camper: Reasons for Living travel, future travel, temporary low-cost housing for local or visiting artists$5000 - upgrade my vehicle to pull camper; assure that I/Urban Theater Project have reliable transportation for the long-term$3000 - pay off medical bills$4500 – pay mortgage ahead six months: ensure that my mortgage is paid during Reasons for Living travel and development; make it possible to keep my house so that I can continue to live and work as an artist in Cedar Rapids; provide temporary low-cost housing for local or visiting artists$72500 – pay off my graduate student loans: to reduce my monthly bills and eliminate this obligation for my dad who co-signed on these loans; to take the pressure off of Reasons for Living and Urban Theater Project of Iowa to make money and pay my bills so that we can remain accessible to a wide variety of audiences; to contribute to the long-term financial health of Urban Theater Project so that we have to ask for money less and less. What’s In It For You?Here’s what you can get for your generous contribution:$1-149                   1 ticket to the premiere of Reasons for Living$150-499             2 tickets to the premiere of Reasons for Living$500-999           4 tickets to the premiere of Reasons for Living$1000-2499      8 tickets to the premiere of Reasons for Living$2500-4999      10 tickets to the premiere of Reasons for Living$5000-9999

<h3>Our Campaign</h3>
<p>Green Room Theatre Camp is back and better than ever! We've been working hard to prepare for Season II, and we're finally ready to launch. If you know anything about GRTC, you know we're not in it for the money. Our business model is asinine: Nobody gets paid, we charge the campers a fraction of the actual value, and we give away half of our revenue. But y'know what? We sleep really, really well at night. (Because we're so tired from confronting teen angst every day). </p>
<p>The campaign. The camp-payin'. We need your help. We literally can't run the program without you. We're happy to be the 'boots on the ground' and give these campers a safe place to explore their creativity and expand their skill sets, but we need your support. Check out our Perks and Shopping List to see how you can partner with us. You won't regret it, we promise!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Giving Back &amp; Giving Forth</h3>
<p>GRTC is a non-profit group that operates solely on your donations. And as you create this culture of giving, we are committed to perpetuating it. Every season, we donate 50% of our ticket sales to a charity of the campers' choosing. We believe that the leaders of tomorrow should get a chance to fight social inequality and see (firsthand) the effects of their time, energy and generosity.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Foooood:</strong> If Jason had his way, every day would be Pizza Friday. However, that would shock and mortify the parents who have entrusted us with their children. If cooking for a dozen campers &amp; volunteers is your passion, please drop us a line!</li>
<li>
<strong>Costumes:</strong> What if you were watching Downton Abbey and all the characters were wearing sweatpants with ""Class of 1912"" written on the bums? Proper costumes are essential, but they don't come cheap. </li>
<li>
<strong>Set Materials:</strong> Our curriculum encourages our campers to design their very own set, so while they're busy dreaming of the endless possibilities, we are facing the harsh reality that building materials are incredibly costly. But hey, if Timmy wants a 30-foot fire-breathing dragon, we will do everything in our power, so be it. (If you happen to have a fire-breathing dragon of any size, please let us know. That sounds amazing).</li>
<li>
<strong>Field Trips &amp; Guest Lecturers:</strong> It's important for our campers to see that their artistic exploration doesn't have to end the day camp ends; there is a world of fine arts just waiting to greet them. It's a beautiful world, but it can be a tough one too. Not only do we take our campers on field trips that will inspire them, but we also introduce them to seasoned professionals who can illuminate them to the realities of the BC arts scene.</li>
<li>
<strong>Promo &amp; Printing:</strong> Anybody who performs for a living will agree on two things: (1) Promoting shows is time-consuming and costly, and (2) There is no feeling quite like the electricity of performing for a packed house. We want to give these campers an experience they will never forget.</li>
<li>
<strong>Rehearsal Space:</strong> We have been extremely blessed to have a local church donate their rehearsal space to us this season, which will allow us to save up for our dream goal of eventually owning our own venue. Skip on down to our Wish List to learn more.</li>
<li>
<strong>Venue Space:</strong> They say all the world's a stage... but we can't mount a show in ""all the world."" We need a proper venue. Our shows are polished and professional, and as such they require dedicated theatre spaces. White Rock Players Club has been gracious enough to offer us a discount for three shows, so we are raising funds to see if we can extend our run elsewhere.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Wish List</u></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>A truck or van:</strong> If you had to haul food, campers and sets across the city, would your first choice be a tiny '94 Jetta that collects puddles of rainwater and only starts when it feels good and ready? Me neither, yet here we are. If you have a hookup for a reliable van or pickup truck, please let us know!</li>
<li>
<strong>Storage space:</strong> What do the Arts Club, the Orpheum and the Bell Centre all have in common? None of them have to store their sets, costumes, props, office supplies and legal documents in a single room of an East Van apartment. </li>
<li>
<strong>A permanent rehearsal (and/or performance) venue:</strong> As I mentioned earlier, we have been extremely blessed to have a rehearsal space donated to us this season. But our grand dream is to one day have a theatre space to call our own. A space where we can rig lights and run sound... where we can hang curtains build trapdoors... but most importantly, where youth can come and be weird. No judgment, only mentorship.</li>

<h3>Stories from Season I</h3>
<p>During our first season, we gave the campers a simple assignment: Write a monologue about growing up. Should be easy, right? These are the types of responses we expected:</p>
<p><i>     ""My parents are lame.""</i></p>
<p><i>     ""Yeah, I like him... but do I like-like him?""</i></p>
<p><i>     ""Wake up, Netflix, McDonald's, Snapchat, go to sleep.""</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>But these are the responses we got:</p>
<p><i>     ""When I was young, I lived surrounded by many not-so-friendly people that had a collective grudge against the world. Before the age of 10, I had a drug dealer babysitter, I watched a near murder occur four feet in front of me, had to endure a police interrogation, and was privy to many cases of domestic abuse. But I'm still here. I'm doing fabulous, and I worked really hard towards that. Growing up may of been 'get up, fall down, get up, fall down, get up' but it's my childhood. I am the only person that has a say in how it affects me."" </i></p>
<p><i>     ""Here I stand. Before you: the mirror. You watch my every single move. You see the face of a young person who  is bound to do great things. Mirror, mirror on the wall; Can't you see that I feel small? Can't you see that there's more to me? You've seen me physically evolve, but haven't seen that my ideals change. My priorities shift like any other person. I feel confined. I've been with myself for seventeen years, but I still don't know who I really am. So before you catch my reflection and enclose me once more, remember that seven billion mirrors in this world don't decide who I am. I do.""</i></p>
<p><i>     ""You know, moving sucks. I've lived in four different cities that I know of. I've gone to six different schools and until recently, never in the same one for more than two years. I've had to restart so many times. Moving so much has affected my social skills, too. I never even learned simple things, like how keep a conversation, let alone start one. I’ve been picked on for being myself, being poor, the one time my hair was green because I showered without dye-friendly conditioner. Everyone thought I was gay at one point, and it's not like that's bad; it just isn't me. Have you ever been the one kid who sits in the corner because he doesn't have any friends and doesn't know how to make them? Because I have. Too many times.""</i></p>

I’m thrilled to share this play with you.Snow White Padded Room: Adelaide is commited to a mental facility by her devoted husband Mark when she suffers severe memory loss and hallucinations due to a tragic car accident. Ten years of memory have been wiped away. As she works to recover what she’s lost, Mark isolates her further by keeping everyone else away, keeping a watchful eye on her through a two-way mirror. As her supposed delusions worsen, she tries to remember what caused the accident and who Mark really is. Can Adelaide escape from behind the magic mirror and emerge from her glass coffin by remembering the truthhttps://14streety.secure.force.com/ticket#detai...What We Need & What You GetPutting on theatre costs money.

Our ImpactEd Wood the Musical will help raise the visibility of transgender and gender non-conforming people, and the issues these communities face. Ed Wood produced and directed the first film with a cross-dressing character. Beyond that, he was a pioneer when he starred in Glen or Glenda and the Angora-clad “Shirley” emerged shining a spotlight on transvestism. The producers plan to donate a portion of the full theatrical production net proceeds to LGBT community causes.  Rick Tell’s personal goal is to honor Ed Wood by awarding him a posthumous star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. And just for a few hours, Ed Wood the Musical is a welcome respite from the stress of your fast-paced, social media crammed day as you journey into Ed’s magical world.

  WHAT YOU GET

   RISKS AND CHALLENGESEvery theatrical project begins with the challenge of assembling an experienced team to produce a high quality, successful show.  We have already met that challenge. Our director, writers and producers are seasoned professionals with over 100 years of combined experience in theater. Collectively, they have surmounted the hurdles that a production can encounter. We also have included a contingency in the budget for any unforeseen costs. However, all our experts know that the biggest challenge is being underfunded. That’s why we are creating this Indiegogo campaign. You can be a part of making a musical history by helping fund a show that could run for years to come.  Again, think Rocky Horror Picture Show!·  Contribute to the next steps of this journey.·  Spread the word!

<p>This project started in New York City, talking about Black Lifes and the difference to Germany to the US. In Germany race and racism, has a different sound to it, a different horrible past. But the silence about racism, didn't destroy the discrimination of people in Germany, it made it more structural and subtle. Not just the politics have to face this issue, but the everyday people, parents, teachers, friends and all the people who represent others. We asked ourselves as Theaterartist, what can we do? How are we taking part in this stereotypical way of representing, of telling stories and repeating the habits of old traditions? We had to ask ourselves, had to look into the practice of theater in Germany and the US, we looked into media and representation in general and wanted to break those stereotypical ways of thinking. </p>
<p>This is a process, we just started and we hope to win more and more people to share this reflection on ourselves and the human behavior of discrimination and judgment. How can we not fall into the trap of just traditional behavior, that sets us as humans apart and doesn't bring us together? We would love, to have you support us, with your insights, with your own perspective, with your hopes and dreams, with your critics and worries - we are looking for inclusion and a common community, where we will discover new ways of living together. </p>
<p>Hedda Gabler, and many other 'classical' plays in German Theaters are cast White Actors only. The stereotypical idea, that these roles have to have a certain skin color is still strongly represented, but not talked about. We will cast this wonderful play of Henrik Ibsen (Set: Kristiania, Norway. 1870's) with an all Afro-German ensemble and want to change the closed up perspectives of an idea, that skin color detects the character. The character and soul is made out of other material than skin. But living in a world where race still matters, due that past and present of our behavior - we can't just ignore the fact, that racism isn't alive. It will grow underneath, if we don't take it by it's horn and ask ourselves, what is our common responsibility?! </p>
<p>Please help us to bring awareness into the media world, of how powerful representation is, and how we form our thinking, with they way we tell stories.</p>
</div><p> </p><div> <h3>How you can help?</h3>
<p>As you might know, Theater and Performance is a fugitive moment, that you can not really take with you. The thing you will take with you, is the experience of that moment, that made you laugh, cry or be angry. It can be so powerful, that this moment could change your life, or will hit you like BAM - one day, suddenly and you still carry that magic this art form with you.</p>
<p>To do this work, we need money, to focus our time and craft on those issues, we want to reflect on. We need to space, to rehearse in. We need platforms to share it with a large audience. We need equipment to make it more powerful, if needed and we need you as the supporters to help us make this happen.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The process</h3>
<p> In August 2016 we will hold an intense workshop in Berlin, to create the our own adaption of the play, we will read, talk and discuss the issues of the play and beyond. Then we will explore a sight specific blocking, where the lines between performer and audience is reduced and maybe even, at some moments removed. We will have after talks with the audience and will explore also in conversation, what is means to have an all Black Cast in an classical play in Germany. What perspectives will we discover there? You are invited to be part of this process and we hope to see you there!!</p>
<p>In 2017 we then continue our journey in co-production with a German Theater and will present Hedda Gabler in Berlin to a large audience. With luck and support, we might come along your town too! But maybe you would love to visit us in Berlin too.</p>
<p>To make this all happen, we need your support!!</p>

<h2>WHO WE ARE?</h2>
<p>Label Noir: <br/>The Afro-German artist collective label Noir was founded in Berlin in 2009, artistic directors are the actresses Lara-Sophie Milagro and Dela Dabulamanzi. Label Noir sees one of its main tasks, to create an artistic space where skin color and/or origin of Black Actors, are not limited to generate strangeness and exoticism, while the skin color and/or origin White Actors has universal significance. Behind this is the desire for a theater where the Actor may not embody their skin color, but their humanity. Playing theater is a privilege, a powerful activity that we want to use to reveal new perspectives. We believe that a change of perspective on stage can cause a change of perspective in real life. A look at the history of theater - the latest example is in Germany in 2011 for the first time made publicly, critically discussed blackface uf our stages - nourishes this faith.<br/><a href=""http://www.labelnoir.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.labelnoir.net</a><br/><br/>​The Private Theatre:<br/>The Private Theatre is a not-for-profit group of Artists committed to raw, intimate and startling productions of classical, contemporary and devised work. They believe that authorial initiative in the theater can emerge from any theatrical discipline; that deeper collaborations create better theater; and that those collaborations may be forged across cultures, aesthetics and disciplines. In common with all the arts, theater should aspire to work that affects its audiences deeply, engaging them in encounters that make a profound and ensuring impression. They embrace this mission, and devote themselves to finding the texts, stagecraft and collaborators to support them in its pursuit.<br/><a href=""http://www.theprivatetheatre.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.theprivatetheatre.org</a><br/><br/>Label Gray: <br/>Label Gray was founded in 2011 as The Shades Of Gray by Heidi Mueller-Smith and Miriam Ibrahim, who met during the production Escape From Happiness, in which Heidi was directing and Miriam was acting. Both became dear Friends and shared the vision to create a space where people and their issues aren't labeled as black or white, where diversity and complexity is celebrated. A platform where we could go on the hunt for the truth which lies in the gray - an area where the lines and borders are blurry, that blurriness we want not to become straightened and 'normal' we want to see with it and grow beyond borders.<br/><a href=""http://www.labelgray.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.labelgray.org</a><br/> </p>

</ul><p>Thank you so much in advance! We can’t wait to see you there!</p><p></p></div>","Revel’s End is a mashup of Shakespeare’s last play with original R&B/pop music and collaboratively devised contemporary dance. Set in a Brooklyn night club, Revel’s End is neither musical nor play-with- music, but a new hybrid style: part concert, part play, and part dance party. The weekend of October 20th, we’ll be staging the party to end all parties—and you're invited.

If you can find the entrance to Williamsburg’s Standard Toy Kraft, an unmarked door in the side of a warehouse, you’ll weave your way up several dark and graffiti-ed staircases before entering the dimly-lit hall where Jared Arnold DJs his brand new album, written for Revel’s End and never performed before. You’ll sip drinks and disappear into the blissful anonymity of the dance floor—but, before you know it, the spirit Ariel appears as if (or maybe actually!) by magic, and interrupts the party with a literal storm of light, magic, music, and glitter—whisking you away to the paradise of Prospero’s enchanted island.   



Producing theater is New York is exciting, empowering—and expensive!
This is my first production in New York City. I’m starting from nothing, but trying to make something totally new that’s bold and exciting—and accessible to a wide and diverse group of people. Absolutely anything you can give, no matter how big or small, helps immensely and I would greatly appreciate your support.
Your donation will:1) give us a place to rehearse and perform, 2) help us create a unique and captivating setup that will bring the magic of this play to life, 3) pay our talented performers and crew, and 4) help us market ourselves to a broad audience, and let as many people experience our dance party as possible.
Your generosity will enable us to create work that pushes boundaries and asks important questions. We eagerly invite you to join us, to take part in these conversations and become our long-term collaborator. We have put together some great perks—from signed posters to tickets and free drinks, and even a special, exclusive performance—to say thank you for joining us on this exciting journey.

Christiana, has formed a body of work through a range of media, including dance, theater, video, acting, sculpture and painting.</p><p>Jonathan Walters (the play’s director) founded Hand2Mouth theatre in 2000 and has since than premiered 18 major new works, as well as site-specific and commissioned short pieces in the Portland area, and toured these works regionally, nationally and abroad, presenting at today's leading venues for contemporary theatre performance.</p><p>“Free Will was a gift, from the Grace of God. You and you alone were given this. You were not created to feel small and worthless, depressed or ashamed. <i>You</i> were made to be victorious, the ones who could choose to revel in the celebration of life. We were more than a little jealous... there was some murmuring in the ranks to be sure.”<strong>–the Angel Zephon in <i>Last Dance</i></strong></p><p><strong>Audience Impact</strong></p><p>“What an amazing experience tonight to see ""Last Dance"", it brought out raw emotions in all of us, joy, excitement, passion, despair, feeling of life, it brought tears to our eyes. I was so moved to see how my daughters were brought to tears as they were passionately inspired by this amazing play. I hope that it touches you and your family as it touched me and my family. “<strong>–Rachelle, San Miguel de Allende</strong></p><p>“It was the ultimate existential dialogue about true spirituality, the psychology of human existence, and the paradox of life and death.”<strong>–Bill, San Miguel de Allende</strong></p><p>Jaime Lee’s engagement with the audience was nothing short of fantastic! She was at once, erotic, beautiful, contained, and huge. Her dynamic range was something to behold. Kat simply flowed. I couldn't take my eyes off her, a wonder to behold. My wife and I were in rapture from the first word to the last. <strong>–Chuck, San Miguel de Allende</strong></p><p>One of the best productions I’ve seen. The profoundly beautiful script, stunning visuals and the great talent on stage kept me immersed in the story. A beautiful ode to life. I laughed. I cried. My 17 year old loved it. I am taking the 13 year old this weekend to see it. I am not exaggerating: DON´T MISS IT! <strong>–Vicky, San Miguel de Allende</strong></p><p>Last Dance is more than a play. It’s a spiritual experience. I was crying throughout the play, I was moved, inspired, awakened. Last Dance cracked open my heart, and made me laugh. Last Dance is definitely the most moving performance I have ever witnessed. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone - both adults and children alike. My 7-year old step-daughter went to both performances with me, fell in love with the actresses and, I believe that she somehow received the beauty of the play on a deeper, more emotional level.<strong>–Brandon, San Miguel de Allende</strong></p><p>We are grateful to be offering art to the world in these trying times of political / environmental / racial unrest. The change is painful, yet necessary. We are here because we believe that art can help! <i>Last Dance</i> is an original multimedia play that raises important questions and asks the audience to consider deep issues of our present time; the role of spirituality vs. organized religion, the impact of suicide and questions about the value of life. Our goal is to bring those topics deeply into the audience's mind and heart via a rich work of performance. That’s what art does. That’s what we want to create. Hope. Endurance. Depth. Courage.</p><p><strong>What We Need and What You Get</strong></p><p>All funds raised during out Indiegogo campaign will help us complete the final costs for the premiere of <i>Last Dance</i> in Portland, which are;</p><ul>

Our Festival Dates: Jan 19, 21, 27 @ 9:30; Jan 20, 26, 28 @ 7:30; Jan 22, 29 @ 4pmLast Dance already has an international life, begun with winning a playwrighting contest in Scotland, re-imagined as the umbrella piece for a theater fest in Australia, to the 2015 preview in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico.  The acclaim and community reaction in San Miguel sparked the vision for this Portland Premiere with a fully realized design and performance elements in place.  It extends to the desire to tour, and bring this powerful work to communities and people across the US and beyond in the near future.Who We AreLast Dance was written by Sky Yeager - a playwright who lives in the “now”.   His energy is infectious, compelling; his focus riveting, complete.Jaime Lee Christiana and Kat Macmillan are the plays performers.Kat Macmillan is a dancer and performer with a deep commitment to transformational experience in life and work.  She has performed extensively as a Butoh artist, both solo and as part of the Vangeline Theater, a NewYork City Dance company led by Butoh artist Vangeline.  Kat’s passion includes her continued work in experimental physical theater as well as vocal composition and performance.Jaime Lee Christiana's wide range artistic career spans from her life events to pop-culture. Christiana, has formed a body of work through a range of media, including dance, theater, video, acting, sculpture and painting.Jonathan Walters (the play’s director) founded Hand2Mouth theatre in 2000 and has since than premiered 18 major new works, as well as site-specific and commissioned short pieces in the Portland area, and toured these works regionally, nationally and abroad, presenting at today's leading venues for contemporary theatre performance.“Free Will was a gift, from the Grace of God. You and you alone were given this. You were not created to feel small and worthless, depressed or ashamed. You were made to be victorious, the ones who could choose to revel in the celebration of life. We were more than a little jealous... there was some murmuring in the ranks to be sure.”–the Angel Zephon in Last DanceAudience Impact“What an amazing experience tonight to see ""Last Dance"", it brought out raw emotions in all of us, joy, excitement, passion, despair, feeling of life, it brought tears to our eyes. I was so moved to see how my daughters were brought to tears as they were passionately inspired by this amazing play. I hope that it touches you and your family as it touched me and my family. “–Rachelle, San Miguel de Allende“It was the ultimate existential dialogue about true spirituality, the psychology of human existence, and the paradox of life and death.”–Bill, San Miguel de AllendeJaime Lee’s engagement with the audience was nothing short of fantastic! She was at once, erotic, beautiful, contained, and huge. Her dynamic range was something to behold. Kat simply flowed. I couldn't take my eyes off her, a wonder to behold. My wife and I were in rapture from the first word to the last. –Chuck, San Miguel de AllendeOne of the best productions I’ve seen. The profoundly beautiful script, stunning visuals and the great talent on stage kept me immersed in the story. A beautiful ode to life. I laughed. I cried. My 17 year old loved it. I am taking the 13 year old this weekend to see it. I am not exaggerating: DON´T MISS IT! –Vicky, San Miguel de AllendeLast Dance is more than a play. It’s a spiritual experience. I was crying throughout the play, I was moved, inspired, awakened. Last Dance cracked open my heart, and made me laugh. Last Dance is definitely the most moving performance I have ever witnessed. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone - both adults and children alike. My 7-year old step-daughter went to both performances with me, fell in love with the actresses and, I believe that she somehow received the beauty of the play on a deeper, more emotional level.–Brandon, San Miguel de AllendeWe are grateful to be offering art to the world in these trying times of political / environmental / racial unrest. The change is painful, yet necessary. We are here because we believe that art can help! Last Dance is an original multimedia play that raises important questions and asks the audience to consider deep issues of our present time; the role of spirituality vs. organized religion, the impact of suicide and questions about the value of life. Our goal is to bring those topics deeply into the audience's mind and heart via a rich work of performance. That’s what art does. That’s what we want to create. Hope. Endurance. Depth. Courage.What We Need and What You GetAll funds raised during out Indiegogo campaign will help us complete the final costs for the premiere of Last Dance in Portland, which are;
Scenic design and materials with the show intended for future touring.

And we need YOUR help. </p> <ul> <li>Emily Keaney and Isabella Petrini, lifelong college friends and theatre compatriots, founded BAE Theatre in early 2015 on the principal to instigate and generate change in audiences, the community and the world. </li> <li>Now, BAE Theatre is ready for its next exciting venture, the 2001 New York Fringe Festival hit, ""Matt &amp; Ben"" by comedy genius Mindy Kaling and her equally hilarious bestie, Brenda Withers. This one hour comedy follows the beautiful friendship between young Matt Damon and Ben Affleck and what happens when the mysterious original script of ""Good Will Hunting"" drops down from the ceiling into the middle of Ben's apartment. Hilarity erupts; chaos ensues. </li> <li>Since this is our first time producing a published work, there are additional expenses to be covered, especially as we continue to elevate our production quality in a raised effort to bring exceptional theatre to our community. We are counting our amazing supporters to help bring this beyond hilarious commentary on privilege to the stage, give women a chance to tell this story, and show the community a glimpse inside the friendship of these fascinating people and writers. </li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>This project means more than we can express. If you can help us, we want to reward you:</p> <ul> <li>In comparison to our last production, we are dealing with more costs that are necessary in making ""Matt &amp; Ben"" even better. Some of these costs include production rights, venue, insurance, design, construction, costumes, rehearsal space, ticketing services, maintenance and eventually additional entry and venue costs as we move the show to the 2016 Hollywood Fringe Festival. It's nearly overwhelming, but we know with your help, we can bring this show to life! </li> <li>Isabella and Emily have style. We also love free things. So, we're using the golden rule mentality to treat our supporters the way we want to be treated: with lots of amazing goodies and perks. From some of our favorite stationery treats, to VIP advanced tickets to our play, and other fabulous shows about town, check out our perks to see what fabulous goodies could be traveling to a mailbox near you. Plus, in keeping with the theme of the show, we are inducing some 90s themed incentives in this campaign!</li> <li>Every bit of money raised will be put towards the show. We have a lot of expenses, so even if we don't reach our goal, we will be putting all funds towards the show no matter what! Our fate is in your hands. But seriously. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The ""Why Now""</h3> <p>You might be wondering why we want to put on a play about the world's most-loved Matt and Ben:</p> <ul> <li>We spent a lot of time researching what we wanted to put up as our next production. As a result of our search, we were found a show that we loved (and still want to produce), but shortly after stumbled upon the script for ""Matt &amp; Ben."" We fell in love with the play and knew in an instant that our pretentious, hipster, film-culture-loving LA audience would not be able to pass up it up. However, the show speaks to a wide demographic. Fans of ""The Mindy Project,"" will be surprised and delighted to see a theatrical work co-written by the hilarious, talented Mindy Kaling. It's amazing and inspiring to see how both she and the title characters have risen to the levels of fame and ""success"" mentioned in the play. </li> <li>We are excited to present this play with an exceptional creative team. Although the play focuses on two of the world's most successful male actors, the script is very clear that they be played by two women. This production is directed, acted and produced by women. The whole team is thrilled to bring this kind of story to an LA audience and we can't wait to see what happens when we do.</li> <li>Our journey with ""Matt and Ben"" begins this May at the Attic Theatre in Mid City, but we are hoping it continues at the Hollywood Fringe Festival in June. With your help, we can bring another hit production to the Fringe audience! We're putting every ounce of energy we have into making this show the best it can be. It's not going to be easy, but it will be fun! </li>

But, that doesn't mean you can't help:</p> <ul> <li>Sharing is caring. Please share this campaign with anyone remotely interested in Matt Damon or Ben Affleck--or Mindy Kaling or Brenda Withers. Share it with anyone that loves theatre. Share it with anyone that has money. You never know who's out there that might want to see this show. Repost the link to our campaign on Facebook. Email it to someone over age forty-five. Text them to check their email. Text them to go have a power lunch and then tell them about the show. </li>
<li>We're always on the lookout for other goods and services we can use to make the show better and better. We need resources for set building: materials and builders. It's always good to have a backup rehearsal space. Own a restaurant or bar and either want to feed a production team or partner with us for a fundraising event? We want to talk. We may be looking for some specific props in the near future as well, and borrowing costs less than renting or buying. Plus, your couch could be famous.</li>
<li>Come support us at the show! We know it's not until the spring, but we'll be working on it with everything we've got until then, and we can't wait to see you there. Of course you'll be getting all kinds of social media reminders, but mark your calendar now and be sure to buy tickets as soon as they go live! Take someone on a date to the show. This is going to be a great date night show.</li> </ul> </div> <p>There's more to friendship than ""Good Will."" And with your help, we can make it possible.</p></div>","It's kind of a funny story...

GuignolFest Productions, their multimedia group produces live theatre, video, art work, and the annual 72-Hour Horror Movie Contest in Portland. </p><p>Dylan Hillerman is no stranger to theatre. He has performed in live theatre for over 30 years which includes writing, producing, and directing in productions on the West Coast. His passion for the Alice Cooper band and the man started back in the 1970's and has culminated into the current production of SHOCK OPERA, which first came out in 2016, in Oregon. Julia Reodica is an international interdisciplinary artist with over 25 years of performance art, installation art, and studio/talent management. Together, they bring non-traditional productions to Portland audiences.</p><p>For Dylan and Julia, Alice Cooper made a huge, early impact on their approach to showmanship and storytelling. ""SHOCK OPERA: The Alice Cooper Story"" is many things because Alice reinvented himself throughout his career. As individuals, Dylan and Julia had each evolved as artists in novel ways to make their creations engaging for the audience. Encouraging youth to learn about musical arts is important to all of us as it helps build confidence and critical thinking. Therefore, a portion of ticket sales for ""SHOCK OPERA"" will go to the Artist Mentorship Program (AMP) of Portland and Alice Cooper's Solid Rock of Phoenix.</p><p>SHOCK OPERA is a mirror, a hologram, a dark comedy-- it's a play about the guys who invented the rock show. This play is important to continue as an annual event because Alice Cooper fans, old and new, can relate to the many faces of the rock performer and as a person who experienced glorious highs and tragic low times. Alice Cooper as a band helped shaped the rock and roll world as we know it. Look around at the way their contemporaries in the 1970's followed suit with bringing theater to the rock show. David Bowie, Elton John, KISS, and various punk bands to name a few, followed the wave of what it meant to use all the senses to experience the music. Alice Cooper was a sensation to be felt first hand. </p><p>SHOCK OPERA is the first musical/multimedia play in the world to cover the Alice Cooper story. It does more than play the favorite hits, performed on stage with acting, dancing, and singing-- it also presents the band's history and stories many have never heard. The play was based on multiple sources, especially from Dennis Dunaway's book, ""Snakes! Guillotines! Electric Chairs!"" Alice Cooper's book, ""Golf Monster,"" and ""Supermensch"" a documentary about Alice's lifelong manager, Shep Gordon. After meeting Alice Cooper, the legend himself, he encouraged the troupe to keep going with the play and wants to see how it evolves and to get the show to his Cooper'sTown venue, in Phoenix, Arizona . This play is intended to develop into a feature movie as well. SHOCK OPERA is a living history experience, and the story continues!</p><p>Those who contribute to the SHOCK OPERA campaign are not just supporting the cast and crew in traveling to Seattle, but are helping keep alive, the rock history and influences that Alice Cooper has on contemporary culture. Rock icons are often seen as untouchable, perhaps almost mystical. SHOCK OPERA shows that Alice Cooper was a man who also had challenges facing his mortality, celebrity status, and personal values. Many of his experiences, as extreme as they were, still resonate with every one who sees the play because we all struggle with similar concepts of identity and survival.</p><p>For SHOCK OPERA's Seattle production, a campaign to raise $2000 has been started. These funds go to travel expenses, video production costs, cast and crew stipends, equipment rental, and venue costs.

They demand to be “the one and only,” and consequently, we all practice daily meditations on the reasons why we are right. One new answer must kill the old one. Facts become “alternative facts.” Truisms become Trumpisms.In AUTOPORTRAIT, stories gain sentience and have the unsettling power to unseat truth. A Congressional 9/11 hearing becomes a witch hunt for Condoleezza Rice, and then the setting for her gruesome (if fictitious?) childhood memories. The East Village’s happenings become nothings, sites of the quotidian that bloom into utopian possibilities just upon the horizon.

<p>Andrew is a writer, director and Brighton Fringe award winning actor.  He runs improvisation workshops and his Brighton Fringe 2016 play <i>Year Without Summer</i>  was Highly Recommended by Fringe Review. </p>
<p>Michelle is an MA Screenwriting graduate of the National Film and Television School. Her short play writing credits include Impact Statement @ NVT, Talking Dirty @ Theatre  503 Rapid Response, Projection @ Cockpit Theatre and  a collection of her work <i>Donkin's Demi-Dozen @ Sweet Dukebox,.</i>  Her first full length play, <i>Model Organisms </i>debuted at this year's Brighton Fringe and was awarded four stars from Fringe Guru.</p>
<p>Heather is a performer and comedian.  This Brighton Fringe she performed at The Warren in    <i>Am I F#*kable?  </i>the devised show from Pop Heart Productions,  She's also a member of comedy troupe the Fannytasticals.   </p>
<p>CACOPHONY is CAST IRON THEATRE'S first devised physical theatre production.  A solo show, it takes its inspiration from anything from Jacques Tati to Looney Tunes.</p>
<p>In a world full of sound and fury, one woman is ready to listen! Cutting through the confusion, this vital and dynamic show proves we can say exactly what we mean when we shut the hell up. Physical theatre is blended with a dry wit, steely determination and a shockingly limited vocabulary.</p>
<p>CAST IRON THEATRE is passionate about new writing, bold performances, and memorable experiences. We're excited and giddy to be performing at the EDINBURGH FRINGE this year - and we need your help to get there!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We'll be staging CACOPHONY at SWEET VENUES HOLYROOD and while we're a pretty low cost production there are still some things we need a little help with, including, but not limited to:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Accommodation £2,000</li>
<li>Posters and Publicity  £500</li>
<li>Travel £300</li>
</ul>
<p>We're also seeking to purchase a few more props and costumes after we have successfully sourced free or donated items.  Our wish list of items comes in at around £200. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Look, we know it's embarrassing.  All your performer and artsy friends are asking for a bit of cash for their shows.  They tell you it's 'just the price of a coffee' and add four exclamation marks at the end of their plea.  We'd like to say we're different. </p>
<p>That would be a lie.</p>
<p>Look, it's just the price of a coffee  Plus you'd get to help us artsy theatre types who happen to be your friends, make a magnificent solo show IN EDINBURGH!!!...!</p>
<p>We really do value any contribution you might be able to make.  We're actually very proud of CACOPHONY and our aim for the show is to tour.  Getting to Edinburgh is the first step towards this and we're offering lots of nice perks for you, our contributors, as a way to thank you for supporting and believing in us. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We're sure you know how risky making theatre can be.  It's a costly career we've chosen and we know that we'd be incredibly successful just to break even.  Any shortfall will come directly out of our pockets and that's fine.  Again, we've chosen this!</p>
<p>We believe in CACOPHONY and we're passionate about taking it to Edinburgh and giving it the best chance to continue onwards from there.</p>
<p>We've got form in creating fabulous and challenging new work on a shoestring and we're never going to let a thing like money stand in our way. </p>

<p>Kaley Pruitt Dance is having its NYC Season July 27, 28, &amp; 29 at Triskelion Arts.  We are sharing two NYC premieres and one world premiere this year, and hope you can be a part of making it happen!  After a sold out 2016 Season, we are excited to be adding a 3rd night of performances.</p>
<p>My name is Kaley Pruitt Ozminkowski, and I am the Artistic Director of Kaley Pruitt Dance.  We are a modern dance company based in New York City.  Originally from Ketchum, Idaho, I have taken my dance work to Idaho, California, Massachusetts, Florida, New York, and Illinois.  I now travel between Illinois and New York teaching and creating work on students at Illinois State University, then working with the professional company in New York City. </p>
<p><strong>The Project</strong></p>
<p>This summer I am restaging and reimaging two of my works, <i>Critical Mass</i> and <i>Room for Elephants,</i> and setting them on KPD.  Both works have been in the creative process this year and developed on students at Illinois State University.  I am excited to premiere these works in New York City, and to see how they are grow and transform with the company.</p>
<p><i>Critical Mass</i> revolves around the powerful force of being anonymous, and what the urban landscape allows of the human expressive condition.  It is an incredibly physical, athletic, and high energy group work to music by Too Many Zooz, Steve Reich, and World Saxophone Quartet.</p>
<p><i>Room for Elephants</i> is a nostalgic, playful, and otherworldly quartet about how we retain structures and physical places that held our sense of “home” at one time or another.  The work looks at memory, and how we keep and re-live those spaces we cannot revisit.  The piece is set to several selections by Tin Hat Trio.</p>
<p>I will also be creating a new work over the summer to also premiere in July.  I’m thrilled to be working with company dancers Megan Wubbenhorst, Cassandra Bowser, Ashley Ervin, as well as guest artist, Robert Perales. </p>
<p><strong>Funding Goals</strong></p>
<p>Kaley Pruitt Dance is looking to raise $4,750 through this campaign to fund the dancers’ rehearsal and performance pay, space rental, and costumes.  I am as committed to our artistic vision as I am about paying our dancers fairly for their professional work.  Here is a breakdown of our July season budget:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1,000 – Space Rental for 10 weeks of rehearsal</li>
<li>$2,900 – Hourly Rehearsal Pay for 4 dancers for 10 weeks of rehearsal</li>
<li>$600 – Dancer Performance Pay for 4 dancers for 3 shows</li>
<li>$250 – Costumes for 5 dancers for the new work</li>
</ul>
<p>Know that no donation amount is too small!  Contributions of any amount are incredibly helpful to furthering our work.  Your dollars will go directly towards the dancers pay first and foremost, and then to the other budget items as we approach our funding goal.  If we exceed our fundraising goal, the KPD dancers get a well-deserved raise!  If you want to help but just can't donate, please share our campaign and show information with everyone you know.</p>

<h2>A Letter from the Creator</h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">“I've always thought the journey of an artist was very similar to that of a butterfly. It starts as an egg, a thought, an idea and pops out like the very hungry caterpillar waiting to feed on exotic foods and knowledge. Soon it’s mind and body expands into a fully realized creature. The caterpillar seems to have it all, but a primordial instinct pushes it past the horizon. The caterpillar locks itself away in a stain glass chrysalis and perfects it's craft. Once the butterfly emerges, artistry pours out of every fiber of its being and manifests as wings. Something so beautiful that not even the president of the United States can take it away. The butterfly's wings expand over miles of space and time, and even when it is lost the memories of what was created continues to inspire others. See, First there is a discovery of self. Then, there is a discovery of art. Chrysalis is a multimedia immersive event designed to reflect life and its many mysterious twist and turns metaphorically through the lifecycle of a butterfly. It's a choose your own adventure focused on love, artistry, and awareness of the world around you. The show features the underground theater world’s up and coming vocalists, writers, dancers, musicians, actors, visual artists and more!” -Kodi Lynn (writer/composer/director of Chrysalis) </span></p>
</div><div>
<h2>An introduction to the Creator/Project</h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Hello Indie world! My name is Kodi Lynn, a Nebraska born artist based in Brooklyn. I graduated from the New York Film Academy's 2 yr musical theater conservatory last year. There I participated in several readings, shows, developmental labs, and short films, including Mary &amp; Max, the musical adaptation of the claymation film by Bobby Cronin, and the short film ""Seeking Alice"" that recently won best musical at the 2017 NOVA film festival. Recently I have been working to put up my original show Chrysalis! Now that I have found a producing team in THE CREATORS COLLECTIVE, I am ready to start fundraising! This is where you come in!  This show acts as a platform for not only me but the LGBTQ community, feminists, environmental activists, and struggling artists. The immersive story follows woman 1, as she struggles with sexuality, self respect, peer pressure, demons, love, and loss. This project is set to be August 5, 2017 at a new space on 100 Bogart st.. This project means the world to me, and I give my personal thanks to anyone who decides to donate.</span></p>

I give my personal guarentee that the money raised will directly benefit the show and those involved.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When I graduated from NYFA I began to audition for shows. I quickly found that the world I was apart of wasn't what I had dreamed. I hated it, and I began to hate myself in the process. I quickly grew tired of the type casting and wondered if I was the only one fed up with the industry. I asked my respected peers their opinion, and the results were shocking. Dancers experienced body shaming and struggled with eating disorders. Singers had been lined up by spectrum of blackness and eliminated before they even sang a note. Women told countless stories of inappropriate advances being forced upon them by casting directors, agents, and fellow actors. I was enraged. These people were some of the most talented and dedicated human beings I had ever met yet they weren't booking fulfilling work. I decided that I was going to write a show for those people. The result is an insane cast of actors, singers, musicians, artists, and dancers that have something to prove. I am asking you to donate to support these people. Thank you for your continued support. -Kodi Lynn </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This show so far has been pretty smooth sailing, but putting up a show in NYC is hard. The ever changing city makes it hard to solidify any dates and/or spaces. To combat this struggle I am doing my best to be flexible and to react with calm and swift solutions.</p>

<p><strong>MadMPower Theatre </strong>is dedicated to the promotion of an adjustment of the image and treatment of psychiatric survivors.  We believe that all members of society need, as healthy human beings to work on their mental health, well-being and happiness.  Some have specific diagnosed mental health issues and must be, to be fair and equitable, integrated with all levels of society. Integration is the surest way to eradicate stigma.</p>
<p><strong>Co-founder - Miles Cohen</strong> is a psychiatric survivor with 40 years of performing and directing experience. A graduate of the Canadian Mime School and Playhouse Acting School and has a B.A. in Drama from Bishop’s University. An alumnus of The Second City Touring Company, a founding member and teacher at  Kytes youth theatre for street youth. He studied Mindfulness based Stress Reduction at St. Joseph's Hospital,  studied relaxation techniques at Dorothy Madget Centre and taught ""Living Meditation"" at Ralph Thornton Centre. Miles currently teaches at “Learn” a CAMH day program as well as “Encore” a CAMH pilot program for patients on the ward and is currently a member of Workman Arts; a CAMH based arts organization and served for 6 years on their Board of Directors. </p>
<p><strong>Message from Miles Cohen</strong> - MadPower  Productions is  about the three Rs as it were for psychiatric survivors – Respect, Recovery, and Rights – civil rights. I would like to focus on recovery, because without it nothing else is possible. First of all, I would like to acknowledge Dr. Ashok Bhattacharya, my wife Janet, and Nurse-Psycho-Therapist Elisabeth Krieger, as the holy trinity that engineered my recovery.  Twenty-five years ago, I jumped off a bridge, and sustained an injury primarily of three exploded vertebrae in my spine.  I ended up in a wheelchair in the backroom of a group home.  My family and friends virtually gave up all hope of me having any kind of fulfilling life.  In fact, they were considering a nursing home to take care of me for the rest of my days. In a last ditch effort, Janet (then my friend) piled me and my wheelchair into a cab to see “the wizard of Oakville”, Dr. Bhattacharya.  You could say I was the scarecrow, tin man and cowardly lion all in one fractured psyche and body. Dr. Bhattacharya interviewed me for 30 minutes and then without reservation declared “This man can heal totally”. </p>
<p>Like Captain Picard on Star Trek he turned to Janet and said “make it so”. </p>
<p>Baffled and terrified herself, Janet rolled up her sleeves and did everything she could think of to accomplish this end,  with guidance and wisdom obtained in regular visits  to Oakville. Elisabeth Krieger, then a homecare nurse with training in psycho-therapy, now in private practice, became my advisor, ear, and amazing spiritual counselor.  She happened to be well versed in almost all “New Age” philosophy and spirituality, which I relied on  for inspiration and understanding. Our adult nephew Jamie, wise beyond his years, lived with us for awhile and his loving presence completed a kind of makeshift family compact.

<p><strong>What we need.</strong></p>
</div><div><p>We are raising $15,000.00 to help cover the cost of the production, the vast majority of which will pay the actors and crew, in other words, the artists themselves.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The dream is to create a company that will integrate professional artists who are psychiatric survivors with other professionals.  Many doors can close when someone is diagnosed with a psychiatric illness or during the time of their recovery.  This recovery time and diagnosis should never prevent someone from fulfilling their dream in life.  Sometimes it does. MadMPower seeks to create a safe harbour for people preparing to return to, or begin, their professional career on the stage or as an artist.  This includes those dedicated professionals who work behind the scenes to make a production come to life. You can help us create this safe environment and by doing so reveal a world of wonderful artists who have important things to say and share with all of us.  <u><strong>Integration is the surest way to eradicate stigma. <font>We ask you to help us achieve this goal.</font></strong></u></p>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><div><p>You can help us by telling people about us.  Share this campaign with as many people as you can by using the Indiegogo share tools or email the link.  Come to the play in August this summer and meet us.  You can volunteer on the production, help us with research into other means of funding, follow us and share our <a href=""https://twitter.com/madmpower"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">twitter</a> and <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/MadMPowerTheatre/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">facebook</a> pages.  Volunteer on the production, help us research and organize future events.  </p></div><p> </p></div>","MadMPower Theatre is dedicated to the promotion of an adjustment of the image and treatment of psychiatric survivors.  We believe that all members of society need, as healthy human beings to work on their mental health, well-being and happiness.  Some have specific diagnosed mental health issues and must be, to be fair and equitable, integrated with all levels of society. Integration is the surest way to eradicate stigma.
Co-founder - Miles Cohen is a psychiatric survivor with 40 years of performing and directing experience. A graduate of the Canadian Mime School and Playhouse Acting School and has a B.A. in Drama from Bishop’s University. An alumnus of The Second City Touring Company, a founding member and teacher at  Kytes youth theatre for street youth. He studied Mindfulness based Stress Reduction at St. Joseph's Hospital,  studied relaxation techniques at Dorothy Madget Centre and taught ""Living Meditation"" at Ralph Thornton Centre. Miles currently teaches at “Learn” a CAMH day program as well as “Encore” a CAMH pilot program for patients on the ward and is currently a member of Workman Arts; a CAMH based arts organization and served for 6 years on their Board of Directors. 
Message from Miles Cohen - MadPower  Productions is  about the three Rs as it were for psychiatric survivors – Respect, Recovery, and Rights – civil rights. I would like to focus on recovery, because without it nothing else is possible. First of all, I would like to acknowledge Dr. Ashok Bhattacharya, my wife Janet, and Nurse-Psycho-Therapist Elisabeth Krieger, as the holy trinity that engineered my recovery.  Twenty-five years ago, I jumped off a bridge, and sustained an injury primarily of three exploded vertebrae in my spine.  I ended up in a wheelchair in the backroom of a group home.  My family and friends virtually gave up all hope of me having any kind of fulfilling life.  In fact, they were considering a nursing home to take care of me for the rest of my days. In a last ditch effort, Janet (then my friend) piled me and my wheelchair into a cab to see “the wizard of Oakville”, Dr. Bhattacharya.  You could say I was the scarecrow, tin man and cowardly lion all in one fractured psyche and body. Dr. Bhattacharya interviewed me for 30 minutes and then without reservation declared “This man can heal totally”. 
Like Captain Picard on Star Trek he turned to Janet and said “make it so”. 
Baffled and terrified herself, Janet rolled up her sleeves and did everything she could think of to accomplish this end,  with guidance and wisdom obtained in regular visits  to Oakville. Elisabeth Krieger, then a homecare nurse with training in psycho-therapy, now in private practice, became my advisor, ear, and amazing spiritual counselor.  She happened to be well versed in almost all “New Age” philosophy and spirituality, which I relied on  for inspiration and understanding. Our adult nephew Jamie, wise beyond his years, lived with us for awhile and his loving presence completed a kind of makeshift family compact. ( And I must mention Kazoo the Hamilton Tiger Cat my trusty and loyal feline friend, do not underestimate the power of a loyal cat. )
After ten years insightful patience and observation  by my exceptional  trinity (masterminded by the good doctor ) an Occupational Therapist suggested that I join Workman Arts, a CAMH –based arts organization developed by Lisa Brown, a former psychiatric nurse.  I had extensive theatre training and performance experience ,before I jumped, but afterwards I no more expected to act again onstage than “fly to the moon”.   ( I guess now I am waiting for NASA to call me).

Η κύρια ενασχόληση της ομάδας είναι η μελέτη κειμένων του νεοελληνικού θεάτρου, νέων κυρίως συγγραφέων, μέσω των κωδίκων του ψυχολογικού θεάτρου και του σύγχρονου χορού.</p><p>Σε μία πόλη φιλότεχνη και με έντονη καλλιτεχνική δραστηριότητα όπως η Καλαμάτα, ο θίασος ReAct αναζητά μία στέγη που να καλύπτει το καλλιτεχνικό του όραμα. Μια άλλη πρόταση σε σχέση με τα δημοτικά αμφιθέατρα που διαθέτει η πόλη, τα οποία μοιάζουν περισσότερο με συνεδριακά κέντρα παρά με θεατρικές σκηνές. Μια στέγη που θα υποδέχεται το κοινό φιλόξενα και θα δημιουργεί διαφορετική σχέση μεταξύ θεατών και ερμηνευτών από αυτή που επικρατεί στα θέατρα της πόλης. Μια στέγη που εκτός από μόνιμη έδρα της ομάδας θα είναι σε θέση να φιλοξενήσει με τους ευνοϊκότερους όρους τόσο άλλους επαγγελματικούς θιάσους από όλη την Ελλάδα, όσο και τους πολυάριθμους ερασιτεχνικούς θιάσους της πόλης.</p><p>Προκειμένου να πραγματοποιηθεί το όνειρο για την θεατρική σκηνή, ο θίασος ReAct ζητά την συμβολή σας. Προαγοράζοντας σε προνομιακή τιμή τα εισιτήριά σας για τις παραγωγές του θεάτρου θα βοηθήσετε να συμπληρωθεί το κεφάλαιο, ώστε να μετατραπεί ένα παλιό νηπιαγωγείο σε θεατρική σκηνή.</p><p>Ο θίασος ετοιμάζει δύο παραγωγές για τον Μάιο του 2016 και θα ήταν πολύ ευτυχές να ανέβουν στο καινούριο του σπίτι με την βοήθειά σας.</p><p>The professional theater company Re-Act, based in Kalamata, is trying to acquire a permanent home by converting an old nursery into theater.</p><p>The company was founded in 2015 by Kallirroi Velentza, actress, director and theatrologist and consists of professional actors and dancers. The main pursuit of the team is the study of modern Greek theater texts, especially new writers, through the codes of psychological theater and contemporary dance.</p><p>In an art-loving city with intense artistic activity such as Kalamata, Re-Act is seeking a roof to house its artistic vision. A different proposition in comparison with the typical municipal auditoriums available in the city, which pertain more to convention centers rather than theaters. A roof that will welcome the public warmly and create a different relationship between spectators and performers from the prevailing one in the theaters of the city. A roof, which apart from offering permanent headquarters to ReAct, will also be able to accommodate under the most favorable terms other professional companies from all over Greece as well as the numerous amateur groups of the city.</p><p>In order to realize its dream, ReAct is asking for your contribution. By pre-buying your tickets at a premium price for the theater productions, you help us raise the funds necessary to convert an old nursery into theater.</p><p>ReAct is preparing two productions for May 2016 and would be very happy to present them in its new home with your help.</p>Callirhoe's CV<p>ΣΠΟΥΔΕΣ:<br/>2012-2015:	Δραματική σχολή Θεάτρου Τέχνης Καρόλου Κουν.

<p><b>Beloved is a story about recovering from wounds that won't heal.</b></p>
<p>Based on a true story, Beloved follows one woman's journey through devastating loss and into her ultimate transformation.<b> </b>Her story encompasses things we can't imagine living through until we have: the death of child, the loss of fertility and the end of love through betrayal. <b>Through movement and visual art, this collaborative performance piece</b> examines the universal experiences of grief and heartbreak and explores how we reinvent ourselves after life's darkest turns. </p>
<p><b>MISSION:</b><br/></p>
<p>Created by authors Anastasia Gambill and Monica Welty,<b> Beloved's mission is to bring a raw, vulnerable, honest and moving portrayal of subjects not often looked at in our culture</b>. This piece resonates with the deepest, truest parts in all of us. It explores our common experience of loss and struggle and the way that we connect with each other through the process of healing.

Beloved has a multigenerational cast of 8 local performers, dancers and vocalists.

<p>  New

<p><b>ABOUT THE COMPANY</b></p>
<p>Founded in 1999, Lydia Johnson Dance has been consistently
praised for its distinctive choreography, which uses components of ballet woven
seamlessly into a contemporary dance vocabulary. <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The
New Yorker, Backstage Magazine and Oberon’s Grove </i>have critically acclaimed
the Company for its annual New York Season. LJD has performed at Jacob’s Pillow
Dance Festival, as well as the Great Friends Dance Festival in Newport RI and
the Downtown Dance Festival in NYC.  Lydia Johnson has been a Guest Artist faculty
member at the Peridance Capezio Center in New York where LJD presents Repertory
Workshops for advanced and professional dancers. </p>
<p>Capturing a sense of the depth and spirit of the human
struggle, Johnson’s evocative work is noted for an underlying sense of drama,
which resonates through the predominantly abstract qualities of her
choreography. Music is a powerful component of the Lydia Johnson Dance
experience. Her musical selections include contemporary masters such as Osvaldo
Golijov, Philip Glass, and Henryk Gorecki, as well as classical composers Franz
Schubert and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. As noted dance writer Philip Gardner
explains in <i>Oberon’s Grove</i>, “There is thought, passion and tenderness in
her work, and a depth of musical resonance that is very satisfying to behold.”
Esteemed dance writer Jennifer Dunning wrote in <i>The New York Times</i>: “In dance that challenges the mind as well as
the heart, Lydia Johnson often isolates and reworks components of classical
ballet technique to create a sense of life flowing unhurriedly over mysterious
human stories.” </p>
<p>Lydia Johnson Dance is honored to have been awarded
Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation grants for the past six years and has received a
Harkness Dance Center Space Grant from the 92nd Street Y.</p>
<p>LJD features dancers with great individuality and expressive
ability. Through the years its company’s dancers have performed extensively
with other highly acclaimed companies, among them: American Ballet Theater, New
York City Ballet, the Paul Taylor Dance Company, Lar Lubovitch Dance Company,
Suzanne Farrell, Colorado Ballet, American Repertory Ballet, Sacramento Ballet,
Chicago Ballet and Twyla Tharp.</p>
<p>In the last two years LJD has expanded its relationship with
ballet as a part of Lydia Johnson’s unique voice and vocabulary through its
work with Deborah Wingert who is now the company’s Ballet Mistress. Ms. Wingert
danced under Balanchine in the New York City Ballet for 15 years and is one of
a small group of artists selected by The Balanchine Trust to set Balanchine’s
works on other companies.  Ms. Wingert’s
company ballet classes have added breadth to the LJD dancers balletic technique
which must be melded with a “fall and recovery” aesthetic descended from early
modern dance master Doris Humphrey’s work and combined also with a sense of the
use of contemporary gesture. </p>
<p>The Lydia Johnson Dance School is strongly committed to
increasing awareness of and involvement in contemporary dance. The LJD School
Scholarship Fund gives financially disadvantaged young people the opportunity
to study technique and choreography, and experience the unique creative process
of creating a dance.</p>

</div><p>The Alliance Performance Center of Tucson is a new facility for the presentation of the performing arts,  located on the city’s Northeast side. The facility, known as the APCOT THEATER, will include theatre performances by Tucson’s numerous and talented theatre companies, music recitals and performances, dance groups and more. It will also be available for meetings and events. </p>
<p>The organization’s board of directors are theatre people, not bureaucrats, knowledgable about what it takes to operate a facility for the performing arts. Actors, writers, directors, producers, technicians and others comprise the board. </p>
<p>But, while we have the space, the seats, the people, we need technical equipment to operate a viable performance facility.  </p>
<p>Performing Arts, theatre, dance and music, are important to the growth of children and adults alike. It is a release of sorts.

The facility, known as the APCOT THEATER, will include theatre performances by Tucson’s numerous and talented theatre companies, music recitals and performances, dance groups and more. It will also be available for meetings and events. 
The organization’s board of directors are theatre people, not bureaucrats, knowledgable about what it takes to operate a facility for the performing arts. Actors, writers, directors, producers, technicians and others comprise the board. 
But, while we have the space, the seats, the people, we need technical equipment to operate a viable performance facility.

Series, an interactive and collaborative fight night event that will come to life during the Philadelphia Fringe Festival in September 2016. Last year, I completed an intense theatre apprenticeship in Philadelphia that allowed me to gain a lot of skills, experiences, and confidence. After completing the program, I wanted to use all the skills I gained in one creative project. As I talked to more and more people, I realized a lot of people wanted the same things. So we decided to make our own opportunity; thus The Vs. Series was born.</p>
<p>We didn't want to create a normal show though. We wanted to create something that everyone could enjoy. We wanted a show that would be dramatic, comedic, heart-wrenching, and action-packed. We wanted to showcase the work of young artists, and we wanted to initiate meaningful conversation. So we decided that more people should be involved.</p>
<p>Over the past 6 months over a dozen young playwrights (some of whom have a plethora of experience, some of whom do not) wrote brief 10 minute plays. </p>
<p><span>The only requirements: The plays had to be based around two opposites (peanut butter vs. jelly, republican vs. democrat, pen vs. sword for example) and the plays have to end in the stage direction “They Fight.” There could not be a line, stage direction, or hint as to who wins the fight. That decision is solely up to the audience.</span></p>
<br/><p>Soon enough, the plays were narrowed down to five. Five directors, Five fight choreographers and an ensemble of actors will bring these shows to life, each of which has two separate endings. Now this is where you come in.</p>
<br/><p>This project is big with nearly 50 people involved and 5 separate shows to produce, so not only do we have the typical costs associated with putting up a play, but we have more mouths to feed, more rehearsal space to find, more props to make, and more costumes to create. Through the generosity of friends, family, and mentors, we are off to a great start, but we aren’t done. We want you on our team.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <ul> <li>We are looking to raise $2,500 in addition to what we have already raised. Our funds so far cover space and basic costs. Now I do not believe that any artist should feel like they have to do work for free. Every person involved in this project will be compensated in some way, so that is where the bulk of the donations will go. You will be directly supporting the dreams and ambitions of young artists. The rest will go towards props, weapons rental (if you have a good lead on katana's, give us a shout), costumes, and marketing.</li> <li>By donating you'll receive everything from a mention in our program and on facebook, to a four person table with a six pack of beer and backstage tour at one of our performances.</li> <li>If we do not reach our goal, donations will first and foremost go towards supporting the artists involved. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>""But Bryant! What makes this project soooo unique?"" Let's break it down</p> <ul> <li>This project is giving the opportunity to young artists to work in the industry they love in a professional environment</li> <li>We are devoted to diversity with this project, so far 60% of our playwrights and 80% of our directors are women, That is incredibly uncommon and we are devoted to getting people from all backgrounds involved and represented</li> <li>We want people to talk.

</div><p>MISSION</p>
<p>We
are the Downtown Theatre Group, a Vegas 501c(3) nonprofit, and our mission is to build a
theater. But not just any theater; a state of the art, three hundred to four
hundred seat convertible space that can act as the catalyst of collaboration
between the Las Vegas performing arts organizations; professional, community,
and educational. We want to build a true community arts space in the heart of downtown Las Vegas, a place where
anyone and everyone can come to play, learn, be entertained, and grow as
artists. We will bring artistic opportunity to those that don’t have it,
regardless of the level of artistry they currently possess, by subsidizing our
services and making them accessible to all. We will bring the best of small
equity productions from around the country to the Valley at an affordable
price. We will provide a home to the countless talented Las Vegas performers
who currently have no venue to display their art. And, we will make it our
mission to provide support for other groups of artists who wish to open spaces
of their own, so that the art and culture of Las Vegas will continue to grow,
diversify, and provide us all with more opportunity to express ourselves, both
on stages, and in our everyday lives.</p>
<p>VISION</p>
<p>Downtown Theatre Group was
born out of conversations between three nationally accomplished theatre
professionals who realized, as many before them had, that Las Vegas was without
a true community arts space. The Off-Broadway movement in New York, The Second
City movement in Chicago, The Hollywood Theatre Row in Los Angeles; all these
movements of professional local art needed hubs to grow from, and so it was
quickly realized that Las Vegas needed just such a hub. These ideas and dreams
coalesced into a unique and repeatedly vetted non-profit business model, headed
by a driven and passionate board of directors. In November 2015, after years of
careful refinement of our business and monetary planning, we achieved federal
501(c)(3) non-profit status in just four weeks. These roads, travelled largely
out of view, have led us here.</p>
<p>PASSION</p>
<p>This is where you come in.
If this true community arts space is to move forward in development, retainers
need to be paid, media needs to be developed, and fundraising needs to
commence. So, we’re raising “30k’s in 30 days!” Why $30,000? Wouldn’t a
facility like the one we’re describing cost much more than that? Absolutely;
this will be a multi-million dollar project when it’s all said and done. So
let’s break it down:</p>
<p>$30,000
– Feasibility studies and initial retainers for a philanthropic services team
that specializes in major gifts campaigns for arts organizations.</p>
<p>This will highlight where
our major donors are, and connects us to a team that can raise those millions
of dollars. We also have additional <b>STRETCH GOALS</b> for this campaign, so we can
tackle other needs concurrently:</p>
<p>$50,000
– Raising this amount allows us to retain our philanthropy team and immediately
launch our major gifts campaign.</p>
<p>$75,000
– Raising this amount allows us do everything above, plus retain a respected
design and construction firm that is very interested to work with us, and begin
the architectural process.</p>
<p>$100,000
– Raising this amount allows us to do everything above , plus retain legal,
financial, and brokerage services, which will be essential in moving the
project forward.</p>
<p>These are not glamourous
causes, but they are ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY if the space is going to be a
reality. We need you to seed the project, and we’ll do the rest. Remember,
donations are TAX DEDUCTIBLE (if you would like an e-mail verifying your tax-deductible donation, please use the PAYPAL option)!</p>
<p>SHARE with your friends
and on social media! Campaigns work best when they go viral!</p>

In a world where the internet and social media has become a huge part of our lives,  mONSTER asks: is mass human adoption of new technology without new moral complication? Or has the harm of online culture always been the monster within us?

It was the first piece of legislation to restrict anyone from another country from immigrating to the U.S. It was enforced until 1943, with quotas until 1965, an 83 year period of Exclusion, which set precedent for anti-immigration laws to follow.  </p><p>We are again at a particular crossroad in our nation’s journey with the current administration. The rights of immigrants, women, children, the impoverished, and communities of color are being heavily threatened.

Positive Outcome Mentoring and Dance, Inc. (P.O.M. Squad) is a 501(c)3 organization, with a mission to inspire confidence in girls and help them realize their full potential. We do this through dance training and group mentoring. Coach Tasha, the founder of P.O.M., is a current Washington Redskins Cheerleader. She started this organization because of her passion for dance and her desire to empower girls of all ages.
This campaign is to help P.O.M. purchase two Epsilon Sound Systems ($450/each) and a Generator ($200) for our upcoming Memorial Day parade and they will be used for many more parades in the future. It is important that we reach our goal, otherwise the girls will have difficulty hearing the music. The girls work really hard and look forward to parade day, let's make sure they have an outstanding sound system.    What We Need & What You Get Here are the details:  We need $1100, to purchase two Epsilon Airlink 15 Bluetooth Sound Systems ($450/each) and a Generator (approximately $200). Our unique perks include: recognition, t-shirts, free tickets to the Inaugural ""Confident Girls Rock Co-Op"" and more!    The Impact Our first parade was the Montgomery County Thanksgiving Parade with only 9 girls. Now, we have over 30 talented and beautiful girls who love the program and who recently performed in the National Cherry Blossom Parade. These opportunities to participate in positive performances and parades, build up the girls' confidence and offer a sense of achievement - and these memories and friendships will last a lifetime.

 had many contributions coming from family members, friends and unknown people reaching 
almost 75% of our goal. We didn't got the total amount but what we've 
got (excluding the percentage from the website) it's a great help to 
finance the summer courses she did and the expenses we will have during the next school year. For 
the studies she will do now we will have to pay for lodging, for the 
school, several consumables materials (dance equipment, shoes, tutus, 
etc..), travels and fees for international competitions, therapists and 
more.<br/>To face this challenge we also hope to keep the support her school is giving us and with the extreme willpower of Beatriz. <br/>We
 want to deeply thank everybody that in one way or another have helped 
us with funds, sharing information or even with words of encouragement 
and affection.<br/>We, and Beatriz, will make everything we can do deserve and keep deserving your support.<br/>Soon you will hear about her. We promise! <br/><br/><h3>Actualização da Informação</h3>
<p>Após a gravação deste vídeo e preparação da campanha de crowdfunding (<b>Maio</b> 2015), houve
desenvolvimentos no que se refere à situação da Beatriz. Algumas acções desenvolvidas entretanto levaram a que, após audição, fosse convidada a frequentar uma nova escola de dança em Portugal, para onde irá após frequentar o Amsterdam International Summer School.</p>
<p>A ida para a nova escola de dança implicará viver numa nova cidade onde terá de suportar encargos com alojamento, custos da sua formação em ballet, bem como do material necessário e eventuais participações em concursos de dança. Assim, neste momento, procura-se obter apoio para que ela possa concretizar este sonho e frequentar uma escola de ballet altamente qualificada.</p><p></p><h3><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></h3><h3><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><h3>Update on the information</h3></span></h3><p></p><p>

<p><strong>Mercury Hamlet was created to give all actors equal access to the greatest roles in the Classical canon.  Mercury Hamlet is our first production and exploration of William Shakespeare’s HAMLET, told in 90 minutes by an ensemble of 10 actors.</strong></p>
<p>A journey of exploration that began just under a year ago has grown into the Mercury process.  Ten actors with ten tracks completely prepared and ready to perform gather in front of an audience, and subject themselves to the law of the draw to determine which roles they will perform that night.  This non-traditional approach to the play's casting, editing, and production is not designed merely to be challenging and exciting for the performers, but to reinvigorate Shakespeare as theatre for all - not only the highly educated and the elite.  In a bar, in a theatre, in a gym, in the park, we will gather and listen, to tell our story wherever others are willing to gather and listen.</p>
<p>An offer was made to our ensemble to premier at the legendary Chopin Theatre in Chicago in May. Your contributions will go directly toward making this opportunity a reality.</p>
<p>All donations to this fund go toward operating expenses that need to be covered for our premier performance at the Chopin.  Donations will help us cover rental costs for our rehearsal and performance spaces, advertising expenses, and actor salaries and stipends.  With a unique mix of Equity and non-Equity actors, we have not only a desire, but a need to compensate our artists involved with the project.</p>
<p>Mercury Hamlet’s aspirations are to become a training ground and artistic home for the next generation of professional actors.  Just as our ensemble is prepared for anything, we hope to grow a new audience for the American Theatre that is ready for the unexpected and who sees the characters in themselves and themselves in the characters.  Your donations will help bring us closer to this dream.</p>

<h3>The Clown School East's Premiere Production</h3>
<p><strong>The Clown School East presents: <i>Shipwrecked! An Entertainment, The Amazing Adventures of Louis de Rougemont (as Told by Himself)</i> by Donald Margulies. This live theatre production is magical, imaginative, and features three talented performers creating wondrous adventures!</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Clown School East is asking for your generosity in helping us make this show a reality. Your donations will bring the spirit of imagination and the magic of theatre to the masses! To all our donors, Thank You, Thank You, and Thank You!</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Clown School East presents: Shipwrecked! An Entertainment, The Adventures of Louis de Rougemont (as Told by Himself)</strong> Written by <strong>Donald Margulies</strong> and Directed by <strong>Mike Funt</strong> </p>
<p>The adventurous Louis de Rougemont invites you to hear his amazing story of bravery, survival and celebrity that left nineteenth-century England spellbound. SHIPWRECKED examines how far we're willing to blur the line between fact and fiction in order to leave our mark on the world. The plays tells the grand tale of a famous adventurer who gets lost on the high seas and ends up seeing fantastic things and meeting exotic people. The audience is whisked away from England to the exotic lands of Aboriginal Australia and back again in a story populated by exotic islanders, flying wombats, giant sea turtles and a monstrous man-eating octopus. He is aided by two highly talented players, who play all of the people (and animals) he meets along the way. However, all might not be as it seems…Shipwrecked! brings the joy of storytelling alive, and questions whether a story being real or fabricated makes the journey any less treasured.</p>
<p>The Clown School offers the highest quality of clown training to actors, performers, comedians, and participants from all walks of life, including doctors, teachers, healers, film-makers, and students. We’ve won widespread acclaim for our classes, described as “truly spectacular and unforgettable” in the LA Stage Times and “unbelievable – the best work I’ve ever seen” by comedian June Diane Raphael. After nearly a decade of working with The Clown School in Hollywood, Mike Funt has brought The Clown School's imaginative and hilarious physical theatre sensibilities to the East Coast. The Clown School East has had a very successful year with workshops and events at Workhouse Arts in Lorton, Virginia, ArtFarm in Annapolis, and Greenbelt Community Center, with plans to add more at Washington Improv Theatre and SAK Comedy Lab in 2020. With the success of classes, The Clown School East is proud to announce its foray into production, providing performing opportunities for its students and others in the DC area.</p>

<p>We need to raise £1000 total including any fees to the platform.  A lot of this will be going toward marketing- it's not a cheap thing to do in Edinburgh and a good half of this money will be going to that alone.  The remainder will be spent on props, costume and miscellaneous items that are required to bring the show to life- such as printed scripts and programmes.</p>
<p>There are a number of reward levels for those contributing but beside the rewards you'll be helping to support the arts.  In a time when funding is almost impossible to obtain, and with people looking for entertainment and distraction from the world around, the arts can offer something wonderful - an escape, a time out, peace of mind and relaxation.  You'd be getting satisfaction at supporting an industry that has helped shape the world around us.  But if that sounds a bit too pretentious, there's some cool merch too!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Contrary to what many believe, no one is actually paid by ""the Fringe"" for bringing a show to Edinburgh.  The main way most actors and artists at the Fringe earn from their work (and we all want to do that) is through tickets sold.  Of course it's rarely likely to be a huge amount taken from ticket sales but that amount can dwindle to - in many cases - zero once the costs of actually staging the show are accounted for.  It's no exaggeration that funding from official bodies can be near impossible to obtain, especially with thousands of acts at the Fringe.  You'd be ensuring that the cast and crew can at least come away from the project in a positive way - having earned for their time and effort and work because the production costs are covered.  Small amounts contributed by many mean large amounts don't need to be lost by a few, and we can all work collaboratively, as a collective, to genuinely make the world better - that's what art does.  The impact of your contribution would mean we can bring this project to people, we can give people a chance to relax, to enjoy something and have a couple of hours where they can drift off into another reality.  That's pretty cool. </p>

We're a group of enthusiastic performers bringing a show to the Edinburgh Fringe 2020.  We're a mix of people including both able bodied and those with disabilities, young actors and experienced pros, an international cast and crew of Scottish, Irish, English and American, working together to put on a series of shows adapted from the great mind of Edgar Allan Poe.  We'll be staging four pieces of his including the Raven and the Black Cat at the centuries old Lauriston Castle just outside of the city but we're going to need your help to do it so read on!

</h3></span></h3><p>Tango'd Up in Blues (TUIB) has been bringing Blues and Tango dance to the Playa since 2009. Year-round, we work on improvements to our offering, from collaborations with other camps, to recruiting more fantastic teachers, to upgrading our infrastructure. Unfortunately, so many artists bring an immense amount of talent to the table, but not a ton of money. That's why we're asking you to help us out! With $3500, we can build the best darn dance floor the playa has ever seen. With $5000, we can make necessary replacements to our playa-ravaged sound system and store our infrastructure during the non-dusty parts of the year. And if we could, by some wonderful chance, raise $10000+, we could purchase some dearly needed infrastructure and provide shade and comfortable areas for our campers and the Burning Man public alike. Please help us make our camp as beautiful, inviting, and comfortable as it can be, as we strive to introduce new souls to the joy of dance!</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Dance</span></p><p>“All the ills of mankind, all the tragic misfortunes that fill the history books, all the political blunders, all the failures of the great leaders have arisen merely from a lack of skill at dancing.” - Molière</p><p>Dang. Is freeing people really as easy as teaching them to dance? We got this covered. :)</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">About Tango'd Up In Blues</span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Hello! I'm Sam, and I'm leading Tango'd Up in Blues, our Burning Man camp for 2015. </span></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Our fifty-some dancers, ranging from beginners to internationally-recognized instructors, all share a love of our craft. We work as a team in a harsh environment, teaching dance during the day and hosting parties from dusk 'til dawn. We're consistently rewarded with premier camp placement, including this year.</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Human beings are all searching for connection with others, whether we know it or not. Partner dance is one of the best, safest ways to satisfy that need. What we do positively impacts people. I can tell you, it's been transformative for me, personally, and that's why I'm such an advocate of what we do. </span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The further we spread this skill, the happier and more peaceful the world will be. I’m asking you, on behalf of camp, to help us level up what we’re bringing to the playa this year.</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Why Do We Need Dance?</span></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Long story short, I was raised in a pretty brutal environment. As a result, I was guarded and coldhearted well into my thirties. I learned Lindy Hop because I thought it was cool, then spent eighteen months doing more dictating than listening on the dance floor. </span></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Eventually I found fusion dancing. I remember feeling apprehensive at the freeform style. ""There’s no regimented 8-count? What sorcery is this?” I attended class after class and danced all night. It wasn’t big and flashy, but intimate. I had dances where we never left close embrace and didn’t move more than an inch the whole time, but the connection was profound. It was then that I realized the style of dance I need is not about how many moves you know, but about connection between partners. You can only get that kind connection by being vulnerable and receptive, but once you are, you find ways to drop a lot of garbage you’re carrying around. </span></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">That transformed me from a guy who dances, into a dancer. That’s how I identify now. I’m certainly not the best, and I learn every time I go out on the floor. The community I’ve found has become my chosen family, and I want everyone to have an opportunity to experience that type of human connectedness. </span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">That's why I'm such an advocate of what we do. The further we spread this skill, the happier and more peaceful the world will be.

Our dance surface has evolved from linoleum rolled out on the playa to a modular OSB floor to our most ambitious project yet:  We've designed and are building 1400 square feet of what we believe will be the first portable, quadruple-sprung floating dance floor on playa. It's going to be amazing. </span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">As much as we love to dance, (and believe me, some of us will go from 9pm to 5am) a limiting factor is joint or muscle fatigue from dancing on hard surfaces. Back in the day, high-end dance halls had floors supported by springs made of hundreds of 1x3 wooden slats. They weren’t actually woven, but laid out in layers at right angles to each other and offset from the layers in the same orientation. </span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The pieces of flooring were supported by the underlying grid. This way, a dancer’s weight was never transmitted directly to the ground and voila - a fun, floaty-feeling floor that faithfully foils fatigue!</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">That may be easier to say than visualize so I here is a picture of a layout of the springs:</span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437088685/gjg1vqdbt961enug1m70.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">and a clip of me and Zosha making a scene in Home Depot, featured in the video at the top of the page. :)</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Technical Stuff</span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">We’re sourcing 44 sheets of very high grade 3/4” T&amp;G OSB for our dance surface.

The best price I could find is $35 per sheet, plus delivery. We will also need about 425 utility grade 1x3s and three thousand feet of mule tape to tie it all together. Those are $1.92 each and $190, respectively, plus shipping. Next, five gallons of sealer for $160 and six gallons of gloss finish for $423 to make sure this floor is smooth, level and dancer-proof.  Finally we’ll need some tools and fasteners: staple guns, staples, a couple 50-foot tapes, brushes and rollers to apply layers of sealer and finish, enough 2x4 material to build drying racks for our new floor and a quality circular saw and jigsaw to be used on this and future projects. </span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The labor is free: we’re handling everything as a crew at our pre-playa build party! </span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Added up, I expect our costs will run to $3419 for a portable floor that will lay out in a few hours, last a decade and delight thousands of dancers. Any extra monies will go to support our sound equipment and year-round storage of our infrastructure. If y'all are REALLY generous, we might even be able to afford a shade structure!</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">What You Get</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We’re offering playlists, hugs, private music performance, pickles, a psychedelic color-changing dome to blow your mind, and the opportunity to have your name burned directly on our dance floor. It’s like the Walk of Fame but at the biggest festival you can imagine!

</div></div>","Summary
Tango'd Up in Blues (TUIB) has been bringing Blues and Tango dance to the Playa since 2009. Year-round, we work on improvements to our offering, from collaborations with other camps, to recruiting more fantastic teachers, to upgrading our infrastructure. Unfortunately, so many artists bring an immense amount of talent to the table, but not a ton of money. That's why we're asking you to help us out! With $3500, we can build the best darn dance floor the playa has ever seen. With $5000, we can make necessary replacements to our playa-ravaged sound system and store our infrastructure during the non-dusty parts of the year. And if we could, by some wonderful chance, raise $10000+, we could purchase some dearly needed infrastructure and provide shade and comfortable areas for our campers and the Burning Man public alike. Please help us make our camp as beautiful, inviting, and comfortable as it can be, as we strive to introduce new souls to the joy of dance!Dance“All the ills of mankind, all the tragic misfortunes that fill the history books, all the political blunders, all the failures of the great leaders have arisen merely from a lack of skill at dancing.” - MolièreDang. Is freeing people really as easy as teaching them to dance? We got this covered. :)About Tango'd Up In BluesHello! I'm Sam, and I'm leading Tango'd Up in Blues, our Burning Man camp for 2015. Our fifty-some dancers, ranging from beginners to internationally-recognized instructors, all share a love of our craft. We work as a team in a harsh environment, teaching dance during the day and hosting parties from dusk 'til dawn. We're consistently rewarded with premier camp placement, including this year.Human beings are all searching for connection with others, whether we know it or not. Partner dance is one of the best, safest ways to satisfy that need. What we do positively impacts people. I can tell you, it's been transformative for me, personally, and that's why I'm such an advocate of what we do. The further we spread this skill, the happier and more peaceful the world will be. I’m asking you, on behalf of camp, to help us level up what we’re bringing to the playa this year.Why Do We Need Dance?Long story short, I was raised in a pretty brutal environment. As a result, I was guarded and coldhearted well into my thirties. I learned Lindy Hop because I thought it was cool, then spent eighteen months doing more dictating than listening on the dance floor. Eventually I found fusion dancing. I remember feeling apprehensive at the freeform style. ""There’s no regimented 8-count? What sorcery is this?” I attended class after class and danced all night. It wasn’t big and flashy, but intimate. I had dances where we never left close embrace and didn’t move more than an inch the whole time, but the connection was profound. It was then that I realized the style of dance I need is not about how many moves you know, but about connection between partners. You can only get that kind connection by being vulnerable and receptive, but once you are, you find ways to drop a lot of garbage you’re carrying around. That transformed me from a guy who dances, into a dancer. That’s how I identify now. I’m certainly not the best, and I learn every time I go out on the floor. The community I’ve found has become my chosen family, and I want everyone to have an opportunity to experience that type of human connectedness. That's why I'm such an advocate of what we do. The further we spread this skill, the happier and more peaceful the world will be. I’m asking you, on behalf of camp, to help us level up what we’re bringing to the playa this year.What We NeedEvery year, we get bigger and better at what we do. Our dance surface has evolved from linoleum rolled out on the playa to a modular OSB floor to our most ambitious project yet:  We've designed and are building 1400 square feet of what we believe will be the first portable, quadruple-sprung floating dance floor on playa. It's going to be amazing. As much as we love to dance, (and believe me, some of us will go from 9pm to 5am) a limiting factor is joint or muscle fatigue from dancing on hard surfaces. Back in the day, high-end dance halls had floors supported by springs made of hundreds of 1x3 wooden slats. They weren’t actually woven, but laid out in layers at right angles to each other and offset from the layers in the same orientation. The pieces of flooring were supported by the underlying grid. This way, a dancer’s weight was never transmitted directly to the ground and voila - a fun, floaty-feeling floor that faithfully foils fatigue!That may be easier to say than visualize so I here is a picture of a layout of the springs:and a clip of me and Zosha making a scene in Home Depot, featured in the video at the top of the page. :)Technical StuffWe’re sourcing 44 sheets of very high grade 3/4” T&G OSB for our dance surface. It’s manufactured by huberwoods.com and is much stiffer, more water resistant and more durable than anything else on the market. The best price I could find is $35 per sheet, plus delivery. We will also need about 425 utility grade 1x3s and three thousand feet of mule tape to tie it all together. Those are $1.92 each and $190, respectively, plus shipping. Next, five gallons of sealer for $160 and six gallons of gloss finish for $423 to make sure this floor is smooth, level and dancer-proof.  Finally we’ll need some tools and fasteners: staple guns, staples, a couple 50-foot tapes, brushes and rollers to apply layers of sealer and finish, enough 2x4 material to build drying racks for our new floor and a quality circular saw and jigsaw to be used on this and future projects. The labor is free: we’re handling everything as a crew at our pre-playa build party! Added up, I expect our costs will run to $3419 for a portable floor that will lay out in a few hours, last a decade and delight thousands of dancers. Any extra monies will go to support our sound equipment and year-round storage of our infrastructure. If y'all are REALLY generous, we might even be able to afford a shade structure!What You GetWe’re offering playlists, hugs, private music performance, pickles, a psychedelic color-changing dome to blow your mind, and the opportunity to have your name burned directly on our dance floor. It’s like the Walk of Fame but at the biggest festival you can imagine! Check out the swag! The ImpactYou can’t see it in the video, but when Zosha first stepped on the floor, the look on her face was priceless: all surprise and delight. Something as simple as a piece of OSB over a few sticks of wood arranged in a certain way, and BAM! Happiness. As far as I know, nothing like this has been done before. With this large, improved floor design we will delight guests all night and the word will spread. We are already in contact with other dance camps who admire our audacity and are ready to adopt our design once we show it can be done. Remember the quote at the top of the page - skill in dance can save the world! Don’t you want to be part of this? :)Our Friends, Light At PlayIf you were wowed by that beautiful Radiance Dome in the video above, join the very impressed club! Light At Play has been creating beautiful light structures since 2013, and we are honored to have been the home for the dome for the past two years.

Lower prices than seen in the perks are available. ;)Other Ways You Can Help

<p><b>About the Musical<span></span></b></p>
<p><i><a href=""http://peaceonyourwings.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Peace On Your Wings</a> (Music by Jenny Taira, Lyrics by Laurie Rubin, Book by Jenny Taira &amp; Laurie Rubin)</i> is an original musical inspired by the life of Sadako Sasaki which juxtaposes her story and the events leading up to her death in November 1955 with a fictional story about a group of her friends who rallied support from around Japan to have a monument built in Sadako’s memory to honor the children victims of the atomic bomb.  The fictional elements of the musical provide an opportunity to weave in issues such as bullying that affect children in middle school today.  This groundbreaking show premiered on Oahu in November 2014 to a sold-out crowd.  The cast then embarked on a sold-out statewide tour.  The overwhelmingly positive response has led to an encore performance in Honolulu, as well as plans for US and Japan tours in 2015 &amp; 2016.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>More than a play</b></p>
<p><i><a href=""http://peaceonyourwings.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Peace On Your Wings</a> </i>is more than a musical theater play.  It is part of a continual movement to educate children and adults alike about the important global message of peace.  It is a way to get people to connect with an under recognized piece of history more than any textbook could convey.  Music is a universal language everyone understands which touches people’s deepest vulnerability and emotions.  Music has been utilized for centuries as the most visceral way to personally connect people with current events and past atrocities so that history will not repeat itself.  Responses to the world premiere of<i> <a href=""http://peaceonyourwings.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Peace On Your Wings</a></i> have been overwhelmingly touching and positive.  Audience members who were not familiar with Sadako’s story have now taken her message to heart. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Other audience members were victims of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki themselves, and were moved deeply by our cast of children, saying that they truly paid homage to Sadako and others like her who suffered the after effects.  Many audience members were children, and we were told by their parents that the musical both entertained and moved them.  The goal of </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><a href=""http://peaceonyourwings.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Peace On Your Wings</a></i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> is to bring Sadako’s story to many more audiences, to show how it is the little gestures that make a big difference, and to teach the lesson of “Ichigo Ichie.”  It is a show that will educate audiences of American children and adults alike about a piece of history which greatly affected those in Hiroshima.</span></p>
<p><b>Professional theater by youth for all generations</b></p>
<p>The creators of <i><a href=""http://peaceonyourwings.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Peace On Your Wings</a></i> wanted to write a professional, “adult” piece of musical theater that was challenging, yet appropriate for the ages and vocal ranges of youth performers.  There is a dearth of repertoire of this genre in the musical theater world, as musicals are most often written with the intent of being produced on Broadway or by other professional theater companies with a majority of adult performers.  Youth theater actors are often relegated to adult roles with inappropriate content that needs to be altered, or watered down children’s theater with simplified music and basic story lines.  Conversely, there are a number of theater groups dedicated to commissioning and performing plays and musicals for children, but they are comprised of adult performers.  <i><a href=""http://peaceonyourwings.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Peace On YourWings</a></i> is one of the only plays of its kind, written for an <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">all-youth cast ages 6-18, with content suitable and appropriate for a wide age range of students, and also comprises a substantial educational element by sharing an important piece of world history. </span></p>
<p><b>New voices in musical theater</b></p>
<p>Finally, Asians and Asian Americans are greatly underrepresented in musical theater, and <i><a href=""http://peaceonyourwings.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Peace On Your Wings</a></i> greatly enriches the repertoire for the pool of talented youth Asian actors who have dreams and aspirations of pursuing musical theater careers, and are deprived of opportunities to perform due to typecasting and limited roles.  Because musical theater has been effective in educating audiences about various aspects of history, current events, and issues relevant to a variety of audiences, it is necessary to continue to tell stories that haven’t yet been told via musical theater, and to give voice to those who haven’t been heard.</p>
<p><b>Your support is needed!</b></p>
<p>Ohana Arts, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization and producer of <i><a href=""http://peaceonyourwings.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Peace On Your Wings</a></i> is seeking support for an international tour through the US mainland and Japan, where Sadako’s message of peace can continue to be spread through the powerful voices of children. </p>

Peace On Your Wings (Music by Jenny Taira, Lyrics by Laurie Rubin, Book by Jenny Taira & Laurie Rubin) is an original musical inspired by the life of Sadako Sasaki which juxtaposes her story and the events leading up to her death in November 1955 with a fictional story about a group of her friends who rallied support from around Japan to have a monument built in Sadako’s memory to honor the children victims of the atomic bomb.  The fictional elements of the musical provide an opportunity to weave in issues such as bullying that affect children in middle school today.  This groundbreaking show premiered on Oahu in November 2014 to a sold-out crowd.  The cast then embarked on a sold-out statewide tour.  The overwhelmingly positive response has led to an encore performance in Honolulu, as well as plans for US and Japan tours in 2015 & 2016.

More than a play
Peace On Your Wings is more than a musical theater play.  It is part of a continual movement to educate children and adults alike about the important global message of peace.  It is a way to get people to connect with an under recognized piece of history more than any textbook could convey.  Music is a universal language everyone understands which touches people’s deepest vulnerability and emotions.  Music has been utilized for centuries as the most visceral way to personally connect people with current events and past atrocities so that history will not repeat itself.  Responses to the world premiere of Peace On Your Wings have been overwhelmingly touching and positive.  Audience members who were not familiar with Sadako’s story have now taken her message to heart. 
Other audience members were victims of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki themselves, and were moved deeply by our cast of children, saying that they truly paid homage to Sadako and others like her who suffered the after effects.  Many audience members were children, and we were told by their parents that the musical both entertained and moved them.  The goal of Peace On Your Wings is to bring Sadako’s story to many more audiences, to show how it is the little gestures that make a big difference, and to teach the lesson of “Ichigo Ichie.”  It is a show that will educate audiences of American children and adults alike about a piece of history which greatly affected those in Hiroshima.
Professional theater by youth for all generations
The creators of Peace On Your Wings wanted to write a professional, “adult” piece of musical theater that was challenging, yet appropriate for the ages and vocal ranges of youth performers.  There is a dearth of repertoire of this genre in the musical theater world, as musicals are most often written with the intent of being produced on Broadway or by other professional theater companies with a majority of adult performers.  Youth theater actors are often relegated to adult roles with inappropriate content that needs to be altered, or watered down children’s theater with simplified music and basic story lines.  Conversely, there are a number of theater groups dedicated to commissioning and performing plays and musicals for children, but they are comprised of adult performers.  Peace On YourWings is one of the only plays of its kind, written for an all-youth cast ages 6-18, with content suitable and appropriate for a wide age range of students, and also comprises a substantial educational element by sharing an important piece of world history. 
New voices in musical theater
Finally, Asians and Asian Americans are greatly underrepresented in musical theater, and Peace On Your Wings greatly enriches the repertoire for the pool of talented youth Asian actors who have dreams and aspirations of pursuing musical theater careers, and are deprived of opportunities to perform due to typecasting and limited roles.  Because musical theater has been effective in educating audiences about various aspects of history, current events, and issues relevant to a variety of audiences, it is necessary to continue to tell stories that haven’t yet been told via musical theater, and to give voice to those who haven’t been heard.
Your support is needed!
Ohana Arts, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization and producer of Peace On Your Wings is seeking support for an international tour through the US mainland and Japan, where Sadako’s message of peace can continue to be spread through the powerful voices of children.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

with our exciting campaign!



Crying in the Wilderness Productions is a bespoke theatre company which thrives on creating ambitious theatrical experiences that are immersive, enthralling and unique. The company is led by the producing team of Paul Anthony Morris and Sarah Louise Nunn who have over ten years experience in
producing, directing and developing new plays. Our objective is to inspire through the high quality of our productions conversations with our audience that are lively, exacting and urgent.  Creative Director  
                     
        Creative ProducerWHAT IS SARAI?
Sarai is a provocative drama about
a woman with ambitions to become the founder of a new nation. 

But this quest is no simple adventure into the unknown, neither is it a
journey for the faint hearted as we observe Sarai grappling with the
formidable forces of famine, disease, persecution and civil war in order to realise her vision. 
Written
in consultation with a diverse group of professional women, this epic journey of undeniable heroism also lifts the lid on our own secret desires and ambitions.   

 Paul Anthony Morris - Winner of the First Adopt A Playwright Award!

Award received from International Award-Winning Actress Lindsay Duncan and Sofie Mason, Founder of OffWestEnd.com

WHAT DO PEOPLE THINK ABOUT SARAI? 

Following our one-week research and development (R&D) process at
the Arcola Theatre in 2014, Sarai was critiqued by an audience of directors,
producers, theatre programmers, journalists, executives, artists and members of
the public at a one-off showcase.




FEEDBACK FROM THE R&D SHOWCASE AUDIENCE 

THE COMPANY




SO WHY IS SARAI IMPORTANT TO US?

The production of our play Sarai is also an integral part of the
company’s ongoing initiative to address gender inequality on the British stage. 

In a survey conducted by Loughborough University, women accounted for only 38% per cent of the artists employed in the theatre industry whilst accounting for 68% of audience attendance. 





The alarming disparity between the statics has served to reinforce our resolve as a diverse company, which also promotes theatre for social change, to assist in the transformation of our industry by advocating, through our work, the equality of opportunity for all female artists. 



WHAT WILL YOUR CONTRIBUTION HELP US TO ACHIEVE?


By
contributing to our initiative to produce Sarai you will enable our company to impact the
industry with a heroic vision of women on stage with a
new Art of Humanity that
will be thrilling and empowering for both our artists and our audience. 





Your contribution will also create a number of
fantastic opportunities for our company 


TO BRING TOGETHER a world class team of award-winning artists for our production. 


TO ENABLE US TO USE the three-week run at the Arcola Theatre to attract international companies
and partnerships so that Sarai can be performed to a wider global
audience. 


TO CREATE A LEGACY for the project through film documentation


TO ENHANCE the profile of our company and
highlight the issues for gender equality through the mainstream media.










WHAT DO WE NEED THE FUNDS FOR?

Crying in the Wilderness Productions (CITWP) is a company limited by guaranteed. Your donations will go directly towards the expenditure for the following areas: 






            

WHAT WILL BE THE IMPACT OF BRINGING SARAI TO THE STAGE?

As a company, which believes in the power of the arts
to promote social change, our aim is to produce high quality plays that
will inspire our audience to make a difference.

Your contribution in bringing
Sarai to the stage will be of immense
value also to women who are being supported by charitable organisations within
the probation services, domestic violence agencies and refugee organisations.


In order to increase the
opportunities of women supported by these charities to engage with our project we will schedule certain performances
at an easily affordable concessionary rate and designate them as female only performances, if it is
deemed necessary to protect the identity of the vulnerable young girls and women who rely on these services.
 


In addition the shows
will be accompanied by post show
discussions with prominent women leading the debate on the urgency for
gender equality to promote personal well being. 


Your contribution will
also enable us to offer workshops to
these agencies to help support the personal transformation that young girls and
women in these organisations are striving to achieve.







WHAT IS OUR TRACK RECORD?

Over the past nine
years our company has developed a proven track record for producing  plays that
have captured the imagination of critics and the general public. 


35 cents enjoyed critical success and was
published by Oberon publishers


Identity (renamed Aftermath)
won the Adopt A Playwright Award and was also published by Oberon publishers


The Seer was
recognised as one of the top three plays for production, out of a  submission of over 1500 plays, by West Yorkshire Playhouse one of the UK’s 
largest main house theatres


And Gifted  was awarded the Peggy Ramsay Award


We have also produced to critical success: The Meeting, Click!, Invisible Man and Choices. 








WHY SHOULD YOU TRUST US?


One of our objectives is to make our process as inclusive as possible  by:



CAPTURING our process on film and sharing the experiences with our contributors  




CELEBRATING our outcomes and milestones with our contributors 



DISCLOSING a detailed show report and financial report to our contributors concerning the income and expenditure of our project. 


Our goal is to
develop with our contributors a community. This can only materialise if we as a company are transparent and make ourselves accountable to you. This we believe is the
necessary criteria for developing mutual trust and genuine appreciation for the future.



WHAT ARE THE RISKS AND CHALLENGES?


The risk factors
relating to the production of a new play and how it will potentially capture
the imagination of the general public was successfully tested in  a one off showcase of Sarai following our research & development of the project last
year. 
Having turned the creative risks into massive critical gains our
next challenge will be to build and sustain high levels of audience attendance
for our production.
In conjunction
with the Arcola Theatre our marketing team and campaign will be spearheaded by a multi
media approach which will involve the press, radio, TV and online media. 
Influential figures working in the media will also be enlisted to publicly
advocate for our production through various online networks. 
Listings &
advertising will be placed on some of the large subscription theatre and music
sites amongst a whole host of other conventional strategies already
planned to attract a large audience for our production.





OTHER WAYS THAT YOU CAN HELP TO MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE...

some people might not be in the position to contribute financially to our project
but would still like to be part of the
community that makes this project happen.

Shen Wei Dance Arts is thrilled to announce a new space for dance in our welcoming studio in the landmark West Park Presbyterian Church on 165 West 86th St (near Amsterdam) on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. We love the sun-filled studio’s 50’ by 30’ sprung, wooden dance floor and soaring rafters—an inspiring atmosphere for creativity.The New York dance community is famously vibrant, yet there is a real shortage of affordable, large studio space for performing artists to create their work. Shen Wei Dance Arts is committed to expanding the presence of dance in the city and are excited for you to join us in this effort. Your contributions will directly support the equipment, materials and renovations needed to transform our new studio into a well-equipped, versatile and commodious space for the dance community – a space for dance rehearsals, classes, and informal showings as well as an intimate performance venue – and for Shen Wei Dance Arts’ expanded programming for artists and audiences. Here's a sneak peek of the programs we envision:



For Artists
Workshops and Intensives for Dancers
Dive into Shen Wei’s movement with technique and repertory workshops and now biannual intensives.



Choreographic Residencies 
A curated rehearsal space program that will grant up to 200 hours of free studio space to a group of compelling choreographers each year...It could be YOU!
Rehearsal and Performance Space
A venue where artists can show their work affordably. Reduced rental rates for non-profit rehearsals, showings, and classes.

For Audiences and the Community

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>Home Theatre Productions wants to make the theatre feel like home! Fans of popular culture, we draw our inspiration from sources such as TV, trashy movies, video games, horror, fantasy, science fiction, comic books, and cartoons. We want to make sure that audiences feel like they belong, creating an atmosphere that encourages community, sincerity, and openness.</p>
<p>Grab a bucket of popcorn, throw on your favourite graphic tee and settle in. Or grab a bottle of wine, throw on your cha-cha heels and settle in. Whatever you grab, and whatever you throw on, make yourself feel at home, because Home Theatre is all about making theatre a space where you feel comfortable being you! Working to create a space focused on openness and accessibility, Home Theatre celebrates the rowdy, the pulpy, the fun, and the wonderful beauty of the “lowbrow.”</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Putting on a show is expensive! As a group of new artists, the upfront costs are being covered out of our own pockets, and we want to be able to pay each artist working on our project and equal share of the profits. In order to pay our artists a reasonable fee, we aim to cover our costs through fundraising efforts so 100% of the show's profits go to the artists. </p>
<p>Fundraising income goes toward:</p>
<ul>
<li>The costs of renting the Minimain Studio at Mainline Theatre</li>
<li>The rights to [title of show], which are paid to The Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein Organization</li>
<li>Prop costs</li>
<li>Costume costs</li>
<li>Set costs</li>
<li>Investment in future shows</li>
</ul>
<p>Our two largest costs are the rental of the Minimain Studio at Mainline Theatre and the rights paid to Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein. We are minimizing the costs of props, costumes and set to maximize revenue for our artists, while not compromising on the quality of our production.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Perks:</p>
<p>Bronze Sponsor ($5): You will be listed in the program and on our social media page as a bronze sponsor!</p>
<p>Silver Sponsor ($20): You will get a program  and website shout-out, as well as three free raffle tickets when you attend the show! The cast will also include you in a thank-you video to our sponsors!</p>
<p>Gold Sponsor ($50): Gold Sponsors will receive: a shout-out in our program and on our website, a thank you video from the cast, a signed program, 3 free raffle tickets to be awarded when you attend the show, rice krispy treats made by our very own director and brought to the show you will be attending. As a bonus perk, you will get to experience Tulita Pepsi. Not sure what that means? Become a sponsor to find out!!</p>
<p>Platinum Sponsor ($75): Shout-outs, a signed program, a signed prop, a 1 minute acapella song dedicated to you in a genre of your choosing, and a PDF guide to help rid yourself of vampires!</p>
<p>Diamond Sponsor ($100): YOU ARE A DIAMOND! This perk gives you everything included in the platinum perk, plus a Limited Edition Lucas Amato Toy Creation!</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Artists deserve to be paid for their work, it is as simple as that. Your generous donations will allow us to pay our artists fairly for the work they are putting in to the project. We are all either still students, or recently graduated, and so have also incurred the costs of higher education. Your contributions are helping us take our future into our own hands!</p>
<p>You are not only helping our artists, but also the English theatre scene in the Montreal community. As mentioned above, we seek to make theatre accessible to people who may not normally be able to access theatrical performances. As part of this project, we are committed to keeping ticket prices as low as possible. Fundraising efforts such as this campaign help us do that. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Putting on a show is always a challenge! However, we are taking several steps to ensure the success of our organization:</p>
<ol>
<li>In addition to regular theatre-going people, we seek to reach people that do not normally go to the theatre. This increases our target demographic.</li>
<li>While [title of show] is a Broadway musical, Home Theatre Productions will not only be doing Broadway musicals. Our mandate allows us to pick shows that reach people interested in all facets of popular culture, whether it be already performed plays or musicals, or new works! </li>
<li>Our diverse and multitalented team are committed to going the distance, whatever hardships we may face. We have worked together before in some capacity, and we know that we are strong not only as individual artists, but as a collective. </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>GBworks is Gianna Burright and Gwynne Bilski in collaboration with a series of artists, invited to make work on and/or with them.  Gwynne and Gianna are both choreographers with their own respective practices, each making movement-based work deeply rooted in autobiographical experience. Together they create and/or curate work through a feminist lens, engaged in conversations that prioritize collaboration, equality, and openness. The formation of GBworks was instigated by Gianna and Gwynne's desire to create ongoing platforms to showcase their own work while also supporting and presenting the work of other female, female identifying, and non-binary emerging artists.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Currently we are asking for £5,000</p>
<p>This money will be going towards: the venue, venue hire, technician, travel, accommodation, print &amp; marketing materials, studio hire, costuming, and photography/videography (to document the work for archival purposes and to have footage with which we can apply for funding and artist residencies).</p>
<p>In establishing our new collective, GBworks, one of our primary goals is to be able to support our own work, while always striving to support the work of other emerging voices, so it will always be important for us to be able to pay ourselves, as well as our collaborators (other choreographers, artists, composers/musicians, costume designers, lighting designers etc). Anything we make above and beyond out initial target will be going towards future projects and all of the associated expenses that contribute to the value of the platforms we are creating.</p>
<p>As an example; immediately following our run at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, we will be producing a show in London (on August 31<sup>st</sup> at Rosemary Branch Theatre – follow our social media for more updates) where we will be inviting four other emerging female artists (including singer/songwriter and other dance artists and choreographers) and giving them a platform to share their work.</p>
<p> </p>

<h2>Urgency of Our Work</h2>
<p>DU was born out of a commitment to community and responded to provide dance classes to Honolulu’s youth on Furlough Fridays when public schools were closed due to budget cut. We are proud to say that our work remains rooted in community service and a deep sense of KULEANA (responsibility) - values that are held dear in Hawai’i.   </p>
<p>Our creative process builds an ohana that is all about living aloha and honoring our island heritage. Our process thus models the way we wish to relate to one another: with openness, a desire to collaborate, embracing our vulnerabilities as strengths, celebrating WINS and shortcomings. The stories we tell aren’t just about “someone over there” – we stay grounded in <strong>our stories, our experiences, and the issues that affect us and our communities</strong>. In addition, our development period often includes contributions from non-company members and “non-dancers”. </p>
<p>With<strong><i> <a href=""https://www.dunyc-hi.com/immigration"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I’mMigration</a></i></strong>, we hosted 3 immigration meetups around heritage, personal stories and challenges of immigration. Together, everyone in the room built movement phrases based on our individual journeys as well as our relationship to movement. In 2020, we will be in residency at Brooklyn International High School where we will continue to develop movement creation around <i>I'mMigration</i>, while providing a creative platform for the students' personal and family experiences to be examined and shared.</p>
<p>We hope to continue developing more programs like these with community partners. These programs illuminates and communicates all aspects of HUEman experience through exploring our unique individual movement. It is our privilege to honor the past, to honor people, and to use our platform to support connection and healing. </p>
<p>These are some questions we hold with us in our work and we invite you to reflect on these as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who are immigrants? How do/should we re-examine the definition of an immigrant?</li>
<li>As settlers  to this aina (land), what is our kuleana (responsibility) to the indigenous people and place?</li>
<li>How are our individual migrational stories related to current events and social challenges?</li>

<h3>What is Watchlist?</h3>
<p><i>Watchlist</i> has been in development for over SEVEN YEARS! After innumerable rewrites, two trips to Berlin, table reads, and a staged reading, this team is thrilled to bring a full production of Lindsay Hope Simon's <i>Watchlist</i> to The Tank in 2020.</p>
<p>Our team believes in paying artists for their work. Theatre is currently more valuable than ever as a means to hold up a mirror to society and process, as a community, the lives we lead and what gives them meaning. <i>Watchlist</i> presents audiences with the opportunity to consider what we fight for and what we take for granted in the information age. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The Tank is an incredible venue that provides a lot of administrative and production support to artists so that they can focus on creating. But it takes more than just a space and selling tickets to make a show. Funds from this campaign will contribute to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stipends to pay every member of the team - actors, designers, director, stage manager, etc</li>
<li>A budget for a set to bring this play to life</li>
<li>A costume budget, given that Lindsay set half of this play in the 70s</li>
<li>Promotional materials like postcards and posters to get people to come see the show!</li>
<li>Incidentals like script printing and renting rehearsal space</li>
</ul>
<p>Perks as expressions of our gratitude will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social media shout outs</li>
<li>Hand-written thank you notes (from millennials!)</li>
<li>Complimentary tickets to the show!</li>
<li>Producing credit</li>
<li>Nerdy deep dive research collections from Lindsay</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In addition to your perks, you'll have the knowledge that your contribution will help to fund a fully-realized, brand new theatrical production that can take pride in compensating its creators. You will be supporting an intentionally diverse team of folks including women, LGBTQ folks, and people of color.</p>
<p><i>Watchlist</i> is about the world we live in now and how we face the real challenges of being alive in society. How we handle feeling small when the world feels so big. How we fight for what we believe in and never give up hope. Our team believes that's a message the world needs right now, and we want to share it fully with our audiences in the most professional way possible.</p>
</div><div><p>Creating meaningful theatre is challenging enough. Finding the money to produce it is a whole other hurdle. We choose to fund on indiegogo because we'll receive our money even if we don't reach our ambitious goal - and even that goal is based on a modest budget. During and after the holidays is a difficult time to raise money as folks are focused on family gift-giving and end-of-year charitable donations. We hope if you value live theatre you'll consider including us in your generosity.</p></div><div>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Geeksdanz returns to scare the pants off our audiences with Manifestations III: Nightmare Hauntings! Two performances of the (PG-13) show, on <i><strong>Sunday October 27th at 6:30 and 9:00 pm at the Glitter Box Theater</strong></i>, comprise the third year of Geeksdanz's collaboration between dance and storytelling. Featuring a whole new selection of ghost stories told live by our featured storyteller Lisa Hollingsworth-Segedy, Manifestations III melds dance, music and story to create an intensely atmospheric performance that will chill your blood and make your skin crawl. Is that a witch at the window, or a fox at the foot of your bed? An awl-fingered shapeshifter, or a zombie in search of his head? The theater fills with sound and movement as the dancers weave through Lisa's words, urging you not to trust the beings who appear at the height of your nightmares. Tickets $15 at the door.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Most of the funding for this project goes towards paying the artists.  We can't put on this show without our dancers and our spectacular storyteller, and we can't pay them without you!</p>
<p>Some of the funding will go towards promotional materials such as posters, flyers, etc.  We need your help to get the word out and fill the seats!</p>
<p>And some of the funding will go towards covering our production costs - sourcing costumes, paying for rehearsal space, and general overhead.  We need you to keep the company going!</p>
<p>If we surpass our goal, our artists will receive a larger, more appropriate stipend, and we as a company will be better able to continue creating and presenting even more new works!</p>
<p>In return, you get to choose from a host of goodies.  From a coffee date with the artistic director or the storyteller to a poster signed by the whole cast, there's sure to be something you'd like in the list over there.  Go ahead, take your pick!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Geeksdanz’s mission is to introduce dance to audiences that would not normally be drawn to it, and to illustrate the universality of dance as a means of emotional expression. Geeksdanz achieves this by systematically applying the context of dance to an enormous variety of topics and interests, and targeting performances towards the specific audiences who share those interests.</p>
<p>In April of 2013, we presented Challenge Mode, a concert about video games, to an audience comprised of both dance patrons and gamers.  As part of our mission, we presented an excerpt of Challenge Mode at Tekkoshocon X-2, a Japanese Pop Culture convention, and Artistic Director Ellen Deutsch led a discussion panel titled ""An Artist's Views on the Games-As-Art Debate."" Through these events, we encouraged attendees to think critically about the difficulty of defining art, and where and how video games might fit into the art world.  Ellen's panels have since become a fixture of Tekkoshocon, engaging attendees every year in thinking of games and anime as art forms in their own right.</p>
<p>We presented the first edition of ""Manifestations"" in 2013, after showing an excerpt at the Three Rivers Storytelling Festival.  Our second feature work, ""Up to Chance,"" was a real-time dance interpretation of a live Dungeons and Dragons game, which we presented at the Pittsburgh Fringe Festival in May.  The following fall we presented ""Manifestations II"" and introduced dance to even more storytelling fans.  In August of 2015 we took on the work of young adult author John Green with ""Finding Margo, Losing Gus,"" which we presented at several libraries around Pittsburgh.  Each of these works continued our ongoing mission to introduce dance to other audiences.</p>
<p>Your contributions will help us broaden our audience yet again with this third installment in the Manifestations series, and encourage even more people to consider dance as an exciting evening's entertainment.  Plus, you get to help us scare the pants off of our audiences!  What could be better?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can’t contribute, don't sweat it!  Here are some other ways you can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spread the word on facebook, twitter, etc. and make some noise about our campaign!</li>
<li>Tell all your friends, especially those who live in Pittsburgh, and encourage them to come see the show!</li>

<h3>Together, Let's Make History</h3>
<p>For the past five years, Otherworld Theatre has received nationwide acclaim for our dedication to the performance of Science Fiction and Fantasy. Now, we have found an amazing venue in Chicago, and find ourselves with the opportunity to take our movement to the next level and give genre performance a permanent home.</p>
<p>Our aim is to raise money for one full operational year - around $120,000 - to help us cover the costs of city permits, paint, salaries, and equipment we will need to make the space all we dream it can become.</p>
<p><strong>We have already raised 60k in pledges, but we need your help to get us to our ultimate goal.</strong></p>

<p>The property is located at 3914 N Clark Street. The venue boasts a two-stage facility with a 120 seat main stage, 40 seat black box, bar, and lobby located a few blocks north of Wrigley Field.</p>

Now, we have found an amazing venue in Chicago, and find ourselves with the opportunity to take our movement to the next level and give genre performance a permanent home.
Our aim is to raise money for one full operational year - around $120,000 - to help us cover the costs of city permits, paint, salaries, and equipment we will need to make the space all we dream it can become.
We have already raised 60k in pledges, but we need your help to get us to our ultimate goal.

 
The Space

The property is located at 3914 N Clark Street. The venue boasts a two-stage facility with a 120 seat main stage, 40 seat black box, bar, and lobby located a few blocks north of Wrigley Field.
Here are some renderings of our vision below:



The Work
Otherworld Theatre Company, established five years ago, has already made a splash in the Chicago Theatrical Scene.

We were named best new theatre company in The Chicago Reader in 2016, and our Artistic Director Tiffany Keane Schaefer was named best new theatre director in The Chicago Reader for 2017.
We are a 501c3 tax exempt organization. Any donations received will be followed up with a tax-exempt letter.

Below, check out our 2017 Gala Video to see clips of our previous productions:

<p>Gina Femia has written a remarkable play inspired by the amazing world of all-female roller derby. The play explores female relationships and asks how much you’re willing to sacrifice – or lose – to follow your heart.  While it has a serious topic at its core, our Roller Derby team the Brooklyn Scallywags - populated with some wonderful/quirky/real characters - will guarantee  an entertaining evening filled with moments of rich humor, powerful emotion and dramatic (simulated) Roller Derby action!    </p>
<p>We have a theatre space, but we still need…</p>
<ul>
<li>A set</li>
<li>Costumes (14 actors, multiple scenes….over 50 changes!)</li>
<li>Designer stipends – we believe these talented theatre artists should be compensated for their work</li>
<li>Programs, postcards, a banner for the front of the theatre, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>You get the idea.  We need to raise about $10,000 to mount the production we think this script deserves.  We are hoping to raise <i>at least</i> $6,000 of that with this campaign. </p>

<p><strong>THANK YOU for helping bring this script to life</strong></p>
<p>Hopefully some of our perks will inspire you.  But even more importantly, we hope supporting great theatre and this exceptional script will inspire you. </p>

<h3>About</h3>
<p>A leading actress in an award-winning Chinese film? A contender for “The Asian Arts Award”? Once an intern working for the infamous Will Smith? Hong Kong based artist Gabby So carries multiple identities, yet her favorite one is being her own actress-producer, having created 30 one-woman-shows across Hong Kong, New York and Edinburgh. British media <i>Sky TV</i> recognized her as “the rising star of Edinburgh Festival Fringe 2016”, while she was covered by many international media such as <i>The Independent</i>, <i>The Stage</i> and <i>Time Out</i>.</p>
<p>But without your help, she cannot take her latest work, ""Struggle for Happiness"", to New York by the coming New Year. The amount is needed for the minimum production cost and touring expenses of a week run. Crowdfunding is her best means because it endows her with the responsibilities for the people, rather than to a few sponsors or donors; after all, her artistic vision is to create with the public, and especially, with you.</p>
<p>Fringe theater is an underrated source of creativity and freedom around the world. Your contribution will support the experimentation of raw ideas, away from censorship, free from commercial constraints - providing alternatives for the painters, the poets, and the other ""fools who dream"".</p>

<h3>WHY GIVE / WHY NOW / WHY THIS</h3>
<ul>
<li>AMERICAN AF is happening at the NEW OHIO THEATRE SEPTEMBER 21 thro OCTOBER 7 !</li>
<li>my name is Jessica Almasy, I am an actress, writer, art maker and <strong>cofounding member of the TEAM (<a href=""http://www.theteamplays.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.theteamplays.org</a>)</strong>. we recently staged a multigenerational cover band concert of radical reimaginings of seminal protest music in a performance called<strong> PRIMER FOR A FAILED SUPERPOWER. </strong>I was SO SET INTO ACTION by the vision and activism of our director Rachel Chavkin and musical director Orion Johnstone, that <u><strong>when a fortuitous turn of events delivered the opportunity to curate three weeks of theatre space I knew I needed to keep the metabolic community of PRIMER rolling</strong></u>
</li>
<li>I am learning that everything we do is a political act and our stages both in new york city and across america - as often as they are a refuge - are still spaces where white narrative is taken as the neutral base identity and conversation and this is dangerous for everyone. this festival seeks to radically reconfigure the inequity of that centralization, to decentralize whiteness as the norm and the given with ""other"" or ""alternate"" identities as the accent or the subtext and to <strong>create a space that centralizes and illuminates artists of color and queer, radical artists and their work that is speaking IMMEDIATELY, URGENTLY, TO AND OUT OF THIS INCREDIBLY VICIOUS TIME that is both frightening and RIFE WITH POSITIVE POTENTIALITY. </strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>WHAT WE NEED / WHERE IT GOES</b></p>
</div><div><ul>
<li>
<strong>this is an enormous undertaking for me: Im a single mother living out of state (!)</strong> so we need to hire HELP ! <strong>our TD / technical director </strong>will be working every day with their team to get all of our artists in and out of the space with the rehearsal time they need, the gear they need, and the support to dignify their visions</li>
<li>our <strong>graphic design, web design, and art director team</strong> will be working in an incredibly speedy turnover to get our message out and create an online home base to welcome audiences, sell tickets, and make our projects easy to access and get into </li>
<li>
<b>GIFTS ! </b><strong>watching whats happening in Houston now and having been thro Sandy with my family myself, its difficult to espouse physical objects or tokens as gifts</strong> but what we can give is quality content and quality experiences. <strong>in exchange for your donation your name will be posted on your website, on social media, and in our theatre space</strong> so you will be present as much as all of the artists. <strong>in addition, for our asking donation of $100 you will receive an MP3 recording of a selection of great American playwriting, oratory, or literature, chosen especially for you ! </strong>AND you get the thrilling joy of being the financial backer of an inaugural and deeply vital event </li>
</ul></div><div>
<h3>THE IMPACT</h3>

AMERICAN AF is happening at the NEW OHIO THEATRE SEPTEMBER 21 thro OCTOBER 7 !
my name is Jessica Almasy, I am an actress, writer, art maker and cofounding member of the TEAM (www.theteamplays.org). we recently staged a multigenerational cover band concert of radical reimaginings of seminal protest music in a performance called PRIMER FOR A FAILED SUPERPOWER. I was SO SET INTO ACTION by the vision and activism of our director Rachel Chavkin and musical director Orion Johnstone, that when a fortuitous turn of events delivered the opportunity to curate three weeks of theatre space I knew I needed to keep the metabolic community of PRIMER rolling

I am learning that everything we do is a political act and our stages both in new york city and across america - as often as they are a refuge - are still spaces where white narrative is taken as the neutral base identity and conversation and this is dangerous for everyone. this festival seeks to radically reconfigure the inequity of that centralization, to decentralize whiteness as the norm and the given with ""other"" or ""alternate"" identities as the accent or the subtext and to create a space that centralizes and illuminates artists of color and queer, radical artists and their work that is speaking IMMEDIATELY, URGENTLY, TO AND OUT OF THIS INCREDIBLY VICIOUS TIME that is both frightening and RIFE WITH POSITIVE POTENTIALITY. 


WHAT WE NEED / WHERE IT GOES


this is an enormous undertaking for me: Im a single mother living out of state (!) so we need to hire HELP ! our TD / technical director will be working every day with their team to get all of our artists in and out of the space with the rehearsal time they need, the gear they need, and the support to dignify their visions
our graphic design, web design, and art director team will be working in an incredibly speedy turnover to get our message out and create an online home base to welcome audiences, sell tickets, and make our projects easy to access and get into 

GIFTS ! watching whats happening in Houston now and having been thro Sandy with my family myself, its difficult to espouse physical objects or tokens as gifts but what we can give is quality content and quality experiences. in exchange for your donation your name will be posted on your website, on social media, and in our theatre space so you will be present as much as all of the artists. in addition, for our asking donation of $100 you will receive an MP3 recording of a selection of great American playwriting, oratory, or literature, chosen especially for you ! AND you get the thrilling joy of being the financial backer of an inaugural and deeply vital event 

THE IMPACT
this event is as much a performance series to bring smart as hell new work into the light as it is a the continuation and cultivation of artists looking to find and create a healing space, a space from which we can emerge ready to face the next day's challenges with clearer eyes and wiser hearts. this festival is a learning space for everyone involved and is open to the insight and kindness that everyone will bring to it

<p>My name is Johanna Meyer.
I am asking for support to fully produce <i>piece.piece</i>,
my newest evening-length dance, for the first time in New York City. Thanks the Gibney Dance Center's fiscal sponsorship, your donation is tax-deductible. </p>
<p><i>Piece.piece</i> is specifically adapted to each theater venue or environment where it's performed; New York is its second iteration. <i>Piece.piece</i>
will be performed at  Gibney Dance Center in New York City September 9,

<p><b>WHO AM I? </b></p>
<p>I am a dancer and choreographer living and working in New York.
I have been making dances since 1993. I have split my time between making my
own work, choreographing for experimental theater, and performing. Since 2001, I
have made several smaller works, while pursuing working for other
choreographers and directors such as: Karen Sherman, Juliana Francis, Tanya
Gagne, Nami Yamamoto, Ken Nintzel, Victoria Vazquez, Richard Maxwell, and DJ
Mendel, among others,.</p>
<p><i>Piece.piece </i>is the product of three years' work at The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. It<i> </i>was premiered at the Krannert Center For the Performing Arts.
After I came back to New York, Gibney Dance Center asked me to remount <i>piece.piece</i> for their Making Space Fall 2015
series. Originally performed in a spacious black box theater, this new
version is presented in the more intimate Agnes Varis
Performance Lab located at Gibney.</p>
<p><b>WHAT IS THIS?</b></p>
<p><i>Piece.piece </i>is a dance for six dancers, a sound designer, a beanbag, a fox
mask, and a chair. My outlandishly talented team of performers and designers is spread out across Illinois, New York and California, and they are crucial to help reconstruct the world of <i>piece.piece</i>:
Jennifer Allen, Angelica Angulo-Soledad, Emily Bock, Angie Pittman, Hadley
Smith, Lailye Weidman, and sound designer Jeff Zahos. With your help, I will be
able to bring everyone to New York, and give them the compensation they
deserve. </p>
<p><i>Piece.piece</i> is an abstract dance collaged with theatrical moments. Mundane props become a visual spectacle within intricate pathways, spilling into the vestibule and
surrounding area of the theater. The security guard may  have a cameo. It subtly examines theatrical
etiquettes of audience and the performers. It is part poetry, part
entertainment, re-enacting fragments of YouTube nature videos and instructional
dances.  Like most of my work it is
humorous yet poignant.  </p>
<p>It's been a long time since I've made a whole evening of work in New York. Gibney Dance Center has it made it possible to do <i>piece.piece, </i>and I am grateful. <b>I need to raise $10,000 to
fully cover the production expenses of the project. </b>Any amount will help and
adds up to our final goal. Your donations will help with these costs: </p>
<p>Travel expenses </p>
<p>Performer fees</p>
<p>Designer Fees </p>
<p>Rehearsal Fees </p>
<p>Post-production editing</p>
<p><b>Any money raised above $10,000 will
go towards an increase in the collaborating performer fees. </b></p>
