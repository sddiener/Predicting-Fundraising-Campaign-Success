<p>Between the four of us, we’ve written a bunch of songs! So we got to thinkin’…how could we use these songs in a way that could go beyond just touching a few hearts, maybe even meeting practical needs in the lives of people who could benefit from something more tangible than a song. So, we talked about the possibilities and settled on offering this project as a vehicle to support the work of My Father's House in Gresham....they serve the needs of homeless families in the East County area of Portland. </p>

<p>In 2002 I decided to go to college in Ohio for something I did not know anything about...Photography.  I graduated with a 3.8 GPA and a mind full of new &amp; fun knowledge. Who knew how much math was involved in lighting, cutting your own mat boards, and developing your own film? I miss that developer smell.  But that also shows you how long I've been in the photography business.. I mean hello, film?! What is that? For the last 10 years I have worked for two pretty big E-commerce companies. I mainly worked on the post production side of photography.. editing, publishing to web, sending to print..etc. During those last 10 years, in my spare time I have been photographing on location portraits and weddings here and there.  <br/></p>
<p>Fast forward to today, I had a baby.  Life changed.  I now KNOW the life I want to provide my baby with. Show her no matter what, you have to try and reach for your dreams!  My first step was to show her happiness is important... So I left the big e-commerce company for a tiny family owned company couple miles from my house.  That was a HUGE step for me to leave the more financially stable position to not be crying every night before or after work for some lame reason or another. My second step is to become a studio owner! I have owned my business legally for 3 years now, which means I get to pay taxes and all that fun jazz, but I have only been able  to shoot on location. That also means I cant control the seasons or my settings. I want to shoot all year around making everyone feel fabulous during their photo shoot. This will eventually be a full time gig for us. I will become a successful female entrepreneur/role model for my girl.  <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need $4,350 to help renovate our 60 year old garage into a full functioning photo studio. <br/></p>
<p>No Matter what you donate, you will get something in return! <br/></p>
<p>I will be creating an Inspiration Wall in my studio. No matter the amount of money you donate, I will be asking for a photo of yourself that I will hang on my wall for daily inspiration to NOT give up on my dream and keep pushing because you ALL believe in me! That means so much to me!</p>
<p>Will I be throwing a grand opening party?! YES! and for a certain amount of donation, you will be invited! <br/></p>
<p>If you donate and choose one of the mini or full session perks YOU will get to be photographed in the new studio before the public will be able to. <br/></p>
<p>Two of the perks offer wedding packages, and I will tell you straight up, I will not be doing weddings for much longer, so if you want to get a good deal on a wedding package for yourself or a friend, please look into that!</p>
<p>If I don't reach my full goal, all funds that are received, will still go towards making this happen. The most important things that are needed are listed starting at the top. The funds will start there, and work its way down. <br/></p>

<p>I’m a music professional: drummer, percussionist, band leader,
music agent, marketing manager, accountant, tour manager, jazz history lecturer and all around everything in between. I do it all to
be certain there is something creative and musical happening all the time for
myself and all the musicians I’m privileged to work with.</p>
<p>My jazz trio performs seven nights a week at the very
prestigious Houston’s Restaurant on St. Charles Avenue in New Orleans where we
have been for over nine and a half years. This event has given me the
opportunity to feature many of the best jazz musicians in New Orleans.</p><p>Our new album, the Garden District Trio ""Then and Now"" was recorded and mixed by Ben Lorio at the Music Shed Studios in New Orleans and features Jordan
Baker on piano, Richard Moten on upright bass and myself, David Hansen on drum
set. There are eleven songs
for the 1:07 album plus one bonus track (not on the album). Mr. George Horn with Fantasy Recording
Studios in Berkeley, CA mastered our album. Mr. Horn
has mastered many of the best jazz artists worldwide over an amazing career. It
is a huge honor to have Mr. Horn master our CD.</p>
<p>Richard is an iconic bassist who has performed and recorded
with many of the best jazz musicians in New Orleans. Jordan is an amazing
talent who has a sophisticated sound and soulful feel. His classical background has set up a strong foundation for
his love of jazz.</p>
<p>Your donations to our project are matched with equal value at every level. Contributing to this campaign will help
cover the cost of the recording studio, mixing the songs, mastering
the album, the artwork cover design, the musicians’ performance time, Royalty
payments to the song composers, manufacturing CD's and digital
download cards. All of these cost add up quickly
and the days of having a record label advance the funds then recoup fees from
sales have disappeared. As artists we have to be creative in fundraising and we
hope you enjoy our talent.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The Garden District Trio ""Then and Now"" has been entered into the Grammy's in seven categories with an official release date of </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Friday, September 4th, 2015.

The CD will be manufactured and available by the end of September.</span><br/></p>
<p>Although the current music market is moving toward an
all-digital format, many people still enjoy having a physical product that they
can see, feel and take with them. We think it is still important to have a
physical CD available in our local record stores, onsite at our performances
and through our CDBaby distribution partners on-line.</p>
<p>For your support we are offering many matching rewards and incentives
that we think you will appreciate. These include signed copies of the CD,
digital download cards, signed drum heads, my RegalTip Blastics, Drum Sticks and Brushes
that I performed with on the recording, private in-home performances, public
performances in the New Orleans area, in the USA and worldwide. There is a nice and unique range of options offered.</p>

music agent, marketing manager, accountant, tour manager, jazz history lecturer and all around everything in between. I do it all to
be certain there is something creative and musical happening all the time for
myself and all the musicians I’m privileged to work with.
My jazz trio performs seven nights a week at the very
prestigious Houston’s Restaurant on St. Charles Avenue in New Orleans where we
have been for over nine and a half years. This event has given me the
opportunity to feature many of the best jazz musicians in New Orleans.Our new album, the Garden District Trio ""Then and Now"" was recorded and mixed by Ben Lorio at the Music Shed Studios in New Orleans and features Jordan
Baker on piano, Richard Moten on upright bass and myself, David Hansen on drum
set. There are eleven songs
for the 1:07 album plus one bonus track (not on the album). Mr. George Horn with Fantasy Recording
Studios in Berkeley, CA mastered our album. Mr. Horn
has mastered many of the best jazz artists worldwide over an amazing career. It
is a huge honor to have Mr. Horn master our CD.
Richard is an iconic bassist who has performed and recorded
with many of the best jazz musicians in New Orleans. Jordan is an amazing
talent who has a sophisticated sound and soulful feel. His classical background has set up a strong foundation for
his love of jazz.
Your donations to our project are matched with equal value at every level. Contributing to this campaign will help
cover the cost of the recording studio, mixing the songs, mastering
the album, the artwork cover design, the musicians’ performance time, Royalty
payments to the song composers, manufacturing CD's and digital
download cards. All of these cost add up quickly
and the days of having a record label advance the funds then recoup fees from
sales have disappeared. As artists we have to be creative in fundraising and we
hope you enjoy our talent.The Garden District Trio ""Then and Now"" has been entered into the Grammy's in seven categories with an official release date of Friday, September 4th, 2015. It will be available through CDBaby.com and distributed to iTunes, Amazon and twenty plus other digital partners for worldwide distribution. The CD will be manufactured and available by the end of September.
Although the current music market is moving toward an
all-digital format, many people still enjoy having a physical product that they
can see, feel and take with them. We think it is still important to have a
physical CD available in our local record stores, onsite at our performances
and through our CDBaby distribution partners on-line.
For your support we are offering many matching rewards and incentives
that we think you will appreciate. These include signed copies of the CD,
digital download cards, signed drum heads, my RegalTip Blastics, Drum Sticks and Brushes
that I performed with on the recording, private in-home performances, public
performances in the New Orleans area, in the USA and worldwide. There is a nice and unique range of options offered.
In advance, I would like to say thank you for your
generosity, support and kindness. Please remember, every level you purchase receives full value for your support. If you cannot contribute at this time, we
understand, and ask for your help sharing this campaign with others. Your generosity through contributions or sharing this campaign will make a
difference.
Thank you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Maybe you saw my music on NBC’s the Today Show. Perhaps you saw the s.Oliver TV commercial which used my song, Blue Shirt to promote  their spring clothing line.</p><p>I have been hard at work writing for my third CD which I am naming ‘Just Peel It’ and it’s time to take it to the next level! My first two CD’s Toast and Jelly and Blue Shirt were both self-produced. But for my 3rd CD I have teamed up with Indigogo to set up a crowd funding campaign that will give you the opportunity to become a part of my music like never before.</p><p>It’s really simple. The more you contribute the better perks you receive and the closer we get to making this the BEST KID’S CD EVER!!</p><p>I love playing music for kids. There is nothing I would rather do more. Enriching the lives of children through music is one of the greatest joys I get and I am excited to have you become part of the Mr. Harley family. Together we can reach and possibly surpass our goal!</p><p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p><p>I am asking for $8000 to make my 3rd CD. Though that may seem like a lot of money it’s actually quite reasonable. There are numerous procedures involved to make the finish product that you hear in the comfort of your home or car. I will break down where the funds will go.  Recording the CD is the biggest expense.  This will include recording all instruments and vocals.  Though I am multi-talented and am able to play many different instruments, I do need to leave the good stuff to accomplished players and they, like anyone, deserve to be paid for the work they do; so paying the studio musicians is an expense that also goes into recording the album.  Mixing and Mastering is the next biggest expense. Mixing is the process of blending all the individual tracks in a recording to create a version of the song that sounds as good as possible. Mastering is a form of audio post production. It is the process of fusing the collective sounds in the audio mix, maintaining balance across the entire recording, and preparing the finished music project for distribution. In short, it’s the icing on the cake.

Maybe you saw my music on NBC’s the Today Show. Perhaps you saw the s.Oliver TV commercial which used my song, Blue Shirt to promote  their spring clothing line.I have been hard at work writing for my third CD which I am naming ‘Just Peel It’ and it’s time to take it to the next level! My first two CD’s Toast and Jelly and Blue Shirt were both self-produced. But for my 3rd CD I have teamed up with Indigogo to set up a crowd funding campaign that will give you the opportunity to become a part of my music like never before.It’s really simple. The more you contribute the better perks you receive and the closer we get to making this the BEST KID’S CD EVER!!I love playing music for kids. There is nothing I would rather do more. Enriching the lives of children through music is one of the greatest joys I get and I am excited to have you become part of the Mr. Harley family. Together we can reach and possibly surpass our goal!What We Need & What You GetI am asking for $8000 to make my 3rd CD. Though that may seem like a lot of money it’s actually quite reasonable. There are numerous procedures involved to make the finish product that you hear in the comfort of your home or car. I will break down where the funds will go.  Recording the CD is the biggest expense.  This will include recording all instruments and vocals.  Though I am multi-talented and am able to play many different instruments, I do need to leave the good stuff to accomplished players and they, like anyone, deserve to be paid for the work they do; so paying the studio musicians is an expense that also goes into recording the album.  Mixing and Mastering is the next biggest expense. Mixing is the process of blending all the individual tracks in a recording to create a version of the song that sounds as good as possible. Mastering is a form of audio post production. It is the process of fusing the collective sounds in the audio mix, maintaining balance across the entire recording, and preparing the finished music project for distribution. In short, it’s the icing on the cake. The final big expense is Distribution which involves production of the CD so it can become available in physical form as well digital form for downloads on Itunes, Amazon, and Spotify.  Some other expenses include getting the CD artwork done. Artists work tirelessly to make the best image possible that will become my CD cover.  There is also getting all of the CD artwork ready and looking tip top! PerksNow on to the perks!

<p>My name is Luke and I am a music producer living in Syracuse, NY. For as long as I can remember it has always been my dream to make music and it wasn't up until about a year and half ago that I got my chance to work on projects that were actually released. I loved every minute of it, I loved it so much that I along with three of my closest friends who I started this journey with many years ago decided to invest in ourselves. We worked hard saved some money and invested into small equipment's that can allow us to produce our own music. I was the engineer my other friend a graduate from the Art Institute in New York City the videographer, my friend Devon Eure the artist. We knew what was required to make the songs but we knew it will also take us a long time to get noticed, time that we all did not have, so we decided to start our own independent label as well. As of December of last year we became the proud owners of Lanorecords, Inc. We thank God for this journey but our dream had just begun and we need your help in taking it to a whole new level. We are now trying to put together a much adequate studio, one that has all the proper and required equipments in order for us to continue our progress with our dreams. Our plans for this year is simple.</p>
<p>Raise enough money to get studio equipment and produce our very first album off Lanorecords. </p>
<p>The money received will go into these areas and will help us improve significantly our chances of not only making a great project but also getting our project seen by many around the world.</p>
<p>10.000 will be used to buy all the required equipment to set up a proper in house studio within which the album will be produced.</p>
<p>5000 will go into acquiring exclusive beats and also pay for the beat makers that we will have on this project should we need to make any changes to the beats that we buy</p>
<p>10.000 will go into marketing and advertising. it is one thing to make a great project but it's another entirely to properly market and advertise that project.</p>
<p>10.000 will go into the hiring of different producers to work on some songs as we want to produce this project in-house but we do not want it to just be with our producer only we want to also have some established producers work on some of the songs.</p>
<p>5000 will go into paying two or three artiste to feature on some of the songs.</p>
<p>5000 will go into one video shoot to accompany the album.</p>
<p>the remaining 5000 will be saved for any unforeseen problems should we run into one.</p>
<p>The Album will be a 12 tracks album and our focus for this album will be solely based on Hip Hop, Rap, and Pop music to give us the platform to not only have our artist on it but to include others that we will meet on this journey.<br/></p>
<p>The money raised will go into not only the equipment cost but also the other artists that we will feature, the engineer that will mix and master the songs, the recording cost of certain songs as we look to do most part of this project but we also plan to have established engineers work on some of the songs to make it the kind of quality we want.</p>
<p>While reading this you can see our video and the music in it is one that we made using our own equipment that we spend very little to buy. Given the opportunity to get label required equipment I am more that sure that we can make noise in this difficult to break into industry.</p>
<p>To listen to our artist's music just go to his Facebook fan page Devon 'Uri' Eure and Soundcloud, as well as our YouTube page.</p>

   I've been writing songs for almost two-thirds of my life at this point. They have all started the same way- me alone with an acoustic guitar. From the beginning, there have only been a couple of rules: write a strong melody and be honest. Make sure they leave with it stuck in their heads, and make 'em feel it. 

THE RECORD-
   Almost exactly two years ago I had just finished recording my second EP (""Show Your Love"") and went on tour as a solo act for the first time in almost a decade. I crammed my gear into my car, grabbed a couple of my best friends, and went out on the road for a few weeks not knowing who would show up to shows or where we were would sleep at night.

THE GIST-
   It's no secret that the landscape of the music industry has changed dramatically the last decade. The way we consume, buy, and think about music is now different. The Internet has burst the gates wide open; anyone anywhere can put their music online for all to hear without the need of a label, radio play, etc. But with this new frontier comes a catch- you're on your own. Independent musicians are no longer waiting to get signed or to ""make it"". We're out there just trying to make a living for ourselves doing what we know how to do. That's where you come in.
   The best part of my job is playing shows. Yes it can be very grueling, boring, expensive, and down right lonely, but one good show can make it all worth it. In the past couple of years my favorite shows have all been solo shows where I'm playing to a small, intimate crowd. The connection I can make with the audience is like nothing else in the world. It's what keeps me going to the next city. 

   In a similar way, that's what this campaign is. It's an intimate, personal connection that, in a world of white noise and in-your-face marketing, has you here reading my words and hearing my songs. This is a chance for us to connect even further as you are directly a part of this record being finished and brought to the world.YOU ARE WHAT KEEPS ME GOING. YOUR HELP IS WHAT ENABLES ME TO DO WHAT I DO. So thank you. In every way conceivable- thank you. 


SO NOW WHAT-
   So now the fun part. To your right there are tons of super fun ways for you to help make this record possible. From pre-ordering the new record, to Exclusive T-SHIRTS, to a book of my POETRY, to BUYING MY GUITAR, to having me WRITE YOU A SONG, to having me COME AND PLAY A PRIVATE SHOW for you and your friends- there are so many ways for you to help and also get some super cool stuff. 
So where's all this money going, you ask? Well I'll break it down for you:





Press- $3000 | This a huge chunk of the goal and probably the most important. I'm going to be hiring a PR firm to help get this record to every website, blog, and magazine possible. I'm super proud of this record and want to try and get it to as many people as I can.


Mastering- $1100 | This is the final step in finishing a record. It is like the final coat of wax to even everything out and get it all shiny. 


Duplication/Distribution- $1000 | This money is to press CDs and get the record to every online distributer I can.


Incentives- $600 | This is the what I'll need to spend on getting the rewards for everyone that donates: T-shirts, poetry books, the aforementioned CDs, etc.


Indiegogo's Cut- $300 | Indiegogo takes a percentage of what I make from this campaign. About 4% if I reach my goal and about 9% if I don't- so let's make it happen!


  IN CLOSING-
   So to wrap this up, thank y'all so much for your support! Whether you're a new fan or old, I appreciate you even taking the time to read this. Again, I couldn't do anything I do without your help. And every little bit does help! Any extra money made over my goal will go to buying more merch, playing more shows, and making more records. And PLEASE consider sharing this with all your family, friends, strangers, barbers, dog-walkers, and congressmen. Let's join in on getting this record out into the world!
I LOVE Y'ALL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR NEVERENDING SUPPORT,-Matt",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I have always had a love for art and music since
starting out as a budding entrepreneur jewelry designer in 2005. After a year
of working to launch my line successfully, I decided to step out of the box and
try a new and different approach. Gathering 12 artists of different genres, my
first artist collective event was hosted in February of 2006 in downtown
Columbus, Ohio. The event was very successful; however there were a few tweaks
I decided to make to create an even more exciting atmosphere for future events.
Adding a live DJ and 3 poets, the format for the Live Variety Show was being created without
me realizing what was happening! 4 years later the debut of Spit n Sketch Live
took place on May 31, 2010 to a roster of 2 poets, 3 vocalists, 1 comedian, a
dance team, and a live artist at an artsy, yet fun place called Wild Goose Creative.</p>
<p>Five years later, the
foundation has been laid enabling the vision of SnS Live to expand. Since 2006,
we have produced over 50 shows providing opportunity to approximately 400
underground artists while connecting them with over 2600 supporters of the art and
music scene in Columbus, Ohio. We want to keep going and I need you to help me kick
it up a notch! </p>
<p>Our next phase is to
grow the production of SnS Live by booking national comedians, poets, vocalists
and dancers in order to create an environment for the underground talent to
perform with seasoned artists. </p>
<p>Our first choice in booking a national act is to bring Dave Chapelle to Columbus, Ohio's historic Lincoln Theater. Spit n Sketch Live has the potential to be the
next Apollo for the aspiring entertainer. The main difference between SnS Live and
the Apollo is that instead of competing for a cash prize, SnS Live is creating exposure
and employment opportunities for artists and entertainers, shattering the myth
that an artist has to be starving while nurturing their desires to express
their talents and earn a living. Your donation is going to help us achieve this
goal!</p>

<p>BohemeRockstar is poised to become the ultimate online destination for music lovers with a serious case of wanderlust, for those who view the entire planet as their oyster, and who never leave home without a song in their hearts and a fully-charged personal listening device.  </p><p>BohemeRockstar will offer exclusive coverage of some of the most exciting live music festivals and events around the globe, connecting diverse audiences with performances, interviews, and local music scenes.  To further explore the myriad ways in which music unites all of humanity, BohemeRockstar will spotlight the musical experiences indigenous to a particular region, visiting local artists, scholars, students, and others who continue to contribute to their region’s musical legacy and cultural heritage.  </p><p>Lastly, BohemeRockstar will highlight local music education programs, in an effort to drum up support for those programs through charitable donations of monetary funds or equipment (i.e., instruments, literature, etc).</p>
<p>Officially launching in Spring 2015, just in time for my 40th spin around the sun, BohemeRockstar is targeting the following events for the year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Byron Bay Festival, Australia (Byron Bay, AUS)</li>
<li>New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival (NOLA)</li>
<li>Gnaoua World Music Festival (Essaouira, Morocco)</li>
<li>North Sea Jazz Festival (Rotterdam, Netherlands)</li>
</ul>
<p>Between these major festivals, BohemeRockstar will be in on the action at various music industry events, including Grammy weekend in LA, followed by the annual ASCAP “I Create Music Expo,” the Essence Music Festival in New Orleans, and other notable happenings around the country to be determined.</p>
<p><b>MAKING IT HAPPEN</b></p>
<p>Each of you reading these words or watching this video can help bring this vision to reality.  For my inaugural crowdfunding campaign, my goal is to raise $10,000 between January 12, 2015 and February 26, 2015. </p>
<p>Funds raised through my IndieGogo campaign will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Round-trip coach airfare for one</li>
<li>Standard lodging for one for the duration of my stay in each city (hotels, AirBnB, short-term vacation rentals, etc.)</li>
<li>Standard ground transportation (airport to destination where complimentary shuttles are not offered; cab fare, public transportation, car rental where applicable)</li>
<li>Professional website design</li>
<li>Equipment (video camera and/or iPad Air Mini)</li>
<li>Event-related expenses (tickets in the case press credentials are not granted)</li>
</ul><div><b>WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU</b></div>
<p>Contributions to my campaign can be made via credit card, PayPal, and ApplePay for you iPhone 6 users.  As my thank you to all who support my campaign, I have crafted a variety of perks and awards—including BohemeRockstar-branded t-shirts and paraphernalia, mementos from my adventures, and access to exclusive content on the website—you can take advantage of at each contribution level!  And while I fully expect to meet or exceed my funding goal, IndieGogo offers a flexible funding option so that, in the event I do not meet my goal, funds contributed can still be used toward the BohemeRockstar project.</p>
<p><b>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</b></p>
<p>Starbucks founder/CEO/Global Visionary, Howard Shultz, talks about the “BHAG” (“big hairy audacious goal”) in his book, <i>Pour Your Heart Into It.  </i>It’s the notion of doing, creating, or accomplishing something that seems (or may be) an enormous, nearly impossible undertaking, but going for it full-throttle with heart, soul, and strategy.  THAT’s what BohemeRockstar is!  As enthusiastic and excited as I am about this project, my head spins with serious questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How will I fund this?—Through funds raised via IndieGogo, as well as personal funds.</li>
<li>How will I manage the philanthropic/charitable giving end of things?—BohemeRockstar will provide exposure for the music education programs featured on the blog.  That exposure may include interviews, heavy promotion during the feature’s run on the blog, and pushing out the programs’/organizations’ web links through social media.</li>
<li>Who will design the site?—I will hire a professional graphic designer to help elevate my current website, enhance its functionality, and give it a clean, polished look.</li>
<li>What are the taxes/legal implications?—I will work with my personal tax advisor to ensure that I am in compliance with tax code throughout the course of this project.</li>

BohemeRockstar is poised to become the ultimate online destination for music lovers with a serious case of wanderlust, for those who view the entire planet as their oyster, and who never leave home without a song in their hearts and a fully-charged personal listening device.  BohemeRockstar will offer exclusive coverage of some of the most exciting live music festivals and events around the globe, connecting diverse audiences with performances, interviews, and local music scenes.  To further explore the myriad ways in which music unites all of humanity, BohemeRockstar will spotlight the musical experiences indigenous to a particular region, visiting local artists, scholars, students, and others who continue to contribute to their region’s musical legacy and cultural heritage.  Lastly, BohemeRockstar will highlight local music education programs, in an effort to drum up support for those programs through charitable donations of monetary funds or equipment (i.e., instruments, literature, etc).
Officially launching in Spring 2015, just in time for my 40th spin around the sun, BohemeRockstar is targeting the following events for the year:

Byron Bay Festival, Australia (Byron Bay, AUS)
New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival (NOLA)
Gnaoua World Music Festival (Essaouira, Morocco)
North Sea Jazz Festival (Rotterdam, Netherlands)

Between these major festivals, BohemeRockstar will be in on the action at various music industry events, including Grammy weekend in LA, followed by the annual ASCAP “I Create Music Expo,” the Essence Music Festival in New Orleans, and other notable happenings around the country to be determined.
MAKING IT HAPPEN
Each of you reading these words or watching this video can help bring this vision to reality.  For my inaugural crowdfunding campaign, my goal is to raise $10,000 between January 12, 2015 and February 26, 2015. 
Funds raised through my IndieGogo campaign will cover:

Round-trip coach airfare for one
Standard lodging for one for the duration of my stay in each city (hotels, AirBnB, short-term vacation rentals, etc.)
Standard ground transportation (airport to destination where complimentary shuttles are not offered; cab fare, public transportation, car rental where applicable)
Professional website design
Equipment (video camera and/or iPad Air Mini)
Event-related expenses (tickets in the case press credentials are not granted)
WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU
Contributions to my campaign can be made via credit card, PayPal, and ApplePay for you iPhone 6 users.  As my thank you to all who support my campaign, I have crafted a variety of perks and awards—including BohemeRockstar-branded t-shirts and paraphernalia, mementos from my adventures, and access to exclusive content on the website—you can take advantage of at each contribution level!  And while I fully expect to meet or exceed my funding goal, IndieGogo offers a flexible funding option so that, in the event I do not meet my goal, funds contributed can still be used toward the BohemeRockstar project.
RISKS & CHALLENGES
Starbucks founder/CEO/Global Visionary, Howard Shultz, talks about the “BHAG” (“big hairy audacious goal”) in his book, Pour Your Heart Into It.  It’s the notion of doing, creating, or accomplishing something that seems (or may be) an enormous, nearly impossible undertaking, but going for it full-throttle with heart, soul, and strategy.  THAT’s what BohemeRockstar is!  As enthusiastic and excited as I am about this project, my head spins with serious questions:

How will I fund this?—Through funds raised via IndieGogo, as well as personal funds.
How will I manage the philanthropic/charitable giving end of things?—BohemeRockstar will provide exposure for the music education programs featured on the blog.  That exposure may include interviews, heavy promotion during the feature’s run on the blog, and pushing out the programs’/organizations’ web links through social media.
Who will design the site?—I will hire a professional graphic designer to help elevate my current website, enhance its functionality, and give it a clean, polished look.
What are the taxes/legal implications?—I will work with my personal tax advisor to ensure that I am in compliance with tax code throughout the course of this project.
How will I support myself?—I will continue to work as a freelance writer and also pick up contract assignments as often as possible.  My intension is for the blog to eventually be supported by advertisers and sponsors.

In his best-selling book, The Alchemist, Paulo Coehlo writes, “When someone is walking their path, the universe rises to meet them.”  It does seem that, when something is MEANT, eyes, minds, hearts doors, windows, and skies open.  I am fortunate to have personal friends and professional associates who have successfully funded campaigns, and who provide essential information and tips for best practices in running a crowdfunding campaign; I also have mentors whose wealth of experience and wisdom have been integral in helping me flesh out my vision for what BohemeRockstar will be.

<h3>Creating Sonic Palette</h3>
<p><strong>WHAT IS SONIC PALETTE?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Original compositions inspired by iconic Canadian painter Tom Thomson's life &amp; art</li>
<li>Folk/classical crossover performed on piano, hybrid guitar, double bass, violin, viola, cello</li>
<li>Accompanied by a visual element including photos, sketches etc, illustrating Thomson's life, times and work</li>
<li>A vehicle for inspiration, education and celebration of all things artistic and Canadian</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494003397/vkrqahomvcgugcetoe4w.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>WHY HAVE WE CREATED SONIC PALETTE?</strong></p>
<p>Proudly celebrating the beauty of Canada in the year of our sesquicentennial as seem through the eyes of acclaimed artist Tom Thomson, creating SONIC PALETTE seemed a fitting tribute to both art and country.  July 8th, 2017  is the 100th anniversary of Thomson's death. </p>
<p>As passionate admirers of how Thomson brought the wilderness to life in his canvases, we KNEW we had to write music to illustrate how we ""heard"" his art.</p>
<p>Our life is music.  We (Kathryn Briggs &amp; Terry Tufts) have been writing and performing original music collectively for 62 years.  The concept of writing for Thomson has been simmering for ages, since Terry was in high school, in fact. But after a serendipitous conversation with luthier Linda Manzer in early 2016, our imagination, boosted by Linda's enthusiasm, propelled us into Thomson's life and work and the result is...SONIC PALETTE.</p>
<p><strong><i>These are the colours we heard...</i></strong></p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/u4Y__eGPDOk?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Composing music to portray the passion in Thomson's work begged for strings, some of the most emotive and powerful instruments ever.  Writing for strings has been a ""bucket-list"" item of ours and we have found it to be extraordinarily rewarding.  The formation of The Algonquin Ensemble is the result.  The members are:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Kathryn Briggs - piano, composer, arranger</div>
<div>John Geggie - double bass, composer, arranger</div>
<div>Lisa Moody - viola</div>
<div>Laura Nerenberg - violin</div>
<div>Margaret Tobolowska - cello</div>
<div>Terry Tufts - hybrid guitar, composer, arranger</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Lisa, Laura, Margaret, and John have collectively and individually been involved with various string ensembles, orchestras and professional organizations all their working careers including, The National Arts Centre Orchestra, the 13 Strings Chamber Orchestra, the Ottawa Baroque Consort, the Ottawa Jazz Orchestra, Quebec's Prism Ensemble, the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, and the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra, the Screen Composers Guild of Canada.</div>
<div> </div>
<h3><strong>Lifting Sonic Palette to new heights</strong></h3>
<p>This campaign is designed to get SONIC PALETTE really humming.  We were lucky enough to get 2 of our dream gigs almost immediately: performing at the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario FOR the 100th anniversary of Thomson's death and being part of the anniversary series ""Tom Thomson's Wake"" at Leith Church, the church Thomson grew up in outside Owen Sound, Ontario. </p>

<p>The money we raise will go toward:</p>
<ul>
<li>a studio recording of the full Sonic Palette soundtrack (90 minutes)</li>
<li>a massive publicity campaign</li>
<li>image licensing of high resolution digital reproductions of Thomson's canvases from galleries across Canada</li>
<li>fees that go with the Indiegogo campaign (their cut, credit card charges, perk production)</li>
</ul>
<p>We KNOW this project is a great idea because literally everyone we've talked to lights up when we describe it.  That's why we're here, throwing this idea out to you and offering you the opportunity to help make this project soar.  The perks are there to entice you a bit but there's also a ""Just Because I Want to Help"" perk that is just a boost without the fancy stuff to go with it.</p>
<p><strong>New perks will be unveiled as the campaign unfolds.  Stay tuned for video updates!!</strong></p>

A vehicle for inspiration, education and celebration of all things artistic and Canadian


WHY HAVE WE CREATED SONIC PALETTE?
Proudly celebrating the beauty of Canada in the year of our sesquicentennial as seem through the eyes of acclaimed artist Tom Thomson, creating SONIC PALETTE seemed a fitting tribute to both art and country.  July 8th, 2017  is the 100th anniversary of Thomson's death. 
As passionate admirers of how Thomson brought the wilderness to life in his canvases, we KNEW we had to write music to illustrate how we ""heard"" his art.
Our life is music.  We (Kathryn Briggs & Terry Tufts) have been writing and performing original music collectively for 62 years.  The concept of writing for Thomson has been simmering for ages, since Terry was in high school, in fact. But after a serendipitous conversation with luthier Linda Manzer in early 2016, our imagination, boosted by Linda's enthusiasm, propelled us into Thomson's life and work and the result is...SONIC PALETTE.
These are the colours we heard...

 
Composing music to portray the passion in Thomson's work begged for strings, some of the most emotive and powerful instruments ever.  Writing for strings has been a ""bucket-list"" item of ours and we have found it to be extraordinarily rewarding.  The formation of The Algonquin Ensemble is the result.  The members are:
 
Kathryn Briggs - piano, composer, arranger
John Geggie - double bass, composer, arranger
Lisa Moody - viola
Laura Nerenberg - violin
Margaret Tobolowska - cello
Terry Tufts - hybrid guitar, composer, arranger
 
Lisa, Laura, Margaret, and John have collectively and individually been involved with various string ensembles, orchestras and professional organizations all their working careers including, The National Arts Centre Orchestra, the 13 Strings Chamber Orchestra, the Ottawa Baroque Consort, the Ottawa Jazz Orchestra, Quebec's Prism Ensemble, the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, and the Manitoba Chamber Orchestra, the Screen Composers Guild of Canada.
 
Lifting Sonic Palette to new heights
This campaign is designed to get SONIC PALETTE really humming.  We were lucky enough to get 2 of our dream gigs almost immediately: performing at the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario FOR the 100th anniversary of Thomson's death and being part of the anniversary series ""Tom Thomson's Wake"" at Leith Church, the church Thomson grew up in outside Owen Sound, Ontario. 

The money we raise will go toward:

a studio recording of the full Sonic Palette soundtrack (90 minutes)
a massive publicity campaign
image licensing of high resolution digital reproductions of Thomson's canvases from galleries across Canada
fees that go with the Indiegogo campaign (their cut, credit card charges, perk production)

We KNOW this project is a great idea because literally everyone we've talked to lights up when we describe it.  That's why we're here, throwing this idea out to you and offering you the opportunity to help make this project soar.  The perks are there to entice you a bit but there's also a ""Just Because I Want to Help"" perk that is just a boost without the fancy stuff to go with it.
New perks will be unveiled as the campaign unfolds.  Stay tuned for video updates!!

Coming home from gigs late at night, driving through strange neighborhoods, riding the train through desolate stations, walking the deserted streets to your apartment,  gives you a special, intimate look at the city one that many people never even know exists. Those experiences form the artistic backbone for this album; it’s one that all musicians share.  And now I want to share that with you.</p>

As a musician who has spent most of his working life in New York City, the night has always been a special time. Coming home from gigs late at night, driving through strange neighborhoods, riding the train through desolate stations, walking the deserted streets to your apartment,  gives you a special, intimate look at the city one that many people never even know exists. Those experiences form the artistic backbone for this album; it’s one that all musicians share.  And now I want to share that with you.
The People

The Matt Ragsdale/CityLine Trio is a collaborative effort of three longtime NYC musicians from widely diverse musical backgrounds, committed to exploring jazz in a small group setting.
As a musician, I came to New York in 1987 and have been living here making music ever since.

<h2>My name is Aria Jay!</h2>
<p>...and I'm an alternative R&amp;B singer/songwriter based in Brooklyn, NY!  This past September, I independently released my debut EP, ""Growth"".  Since then, it has received support for a re-release with Manimal Vinyl- a label/PR company based in LA.  They are helping to promote its singles, as well as the music video I filmed last year (my very first!) for one of those singles, with director, Janet S. Kim.  Since we have this opportunity to release ""Growth"" to a broader audience, we want to make a visual to go with it.</p>
<p><i>You can find more information about me, as well as hear some of my music at <a href=""http://ariajay.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ariajay.com</a>.</i></p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>About the project...</h2>
<p>The director, Janet S. Kim, and I had already been in discussion about our next project, when I was invited to be a residency artist at Holyrad Studio for the month of January.  We had come up with a visually compelling idea for each of the remaining tracks off of ""Growth"", and each concept seemed to organically inform the next, lending itself to a full visual album.</p>
<p><a href=""https://holyradstudio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Holyrad Studio</a> is a production studio based in Brooklyn, NY, and with my residency there, we have the space and some, but not all, of the means to execute this project.  Your contributions will help us rent equipment (lights, cameras), support some of our crew for 3 full days of work, and help feed us during our shoot. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>About the team...</h2>
<p><i><strong>Janet S. Kim, director/producer:</strong></i></p>
<p>Janet S. Kim is a filmmaker based in Brooklyn.  She has written and directed several shorts including, SHADOW (writer / director), MONKEY (writer / director) and SPEAK CHINGLISH (writer).  She most recently directed Aria Jay's debut music video HE SAID and the short film NOISE.  In production, Janet has also worked on numerous commercial / promo campaigns for clients such as Samsung, Crest, Garnier, Clorox, Tommy Hilfiger, and TBS.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><i>Che Broadnax, director of photography:</i></strong></p>
<p>Che Broadnax has served as director of photography on the Ryan Brothers' Sci-Fi/Horror feature WELCOME TO WILLITS, the 40-minute ART OF DREAMING, and many shorts and music videos, including SubRosa's TROUBLED CELLS, Roger An's ALPHA FISH, and Brandon Boudreaux's NEIGHBORS.  Che has also has kept busy working in camera departments on critically acclaimed films such as THE EXPLODING GIRL, ALREADY TOMORROW IN HONG KONG and THE HISTORY OF FUTURE FOLK as well popular shorts including THE STRANGE ONES, AFTERMATH, and FIRST PRIZE.  As an editor and motion graphics artist, Che has been a regular part of the team at Great City Post, since 2010, working on promo campaigns for MTV and VH1.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>**<i>I worked with both Janet and Che on my first music video and i'm so excited to be collaborating with them again**</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>Lisa Mohar, art direction:</strong></i></p>
<p>Hailing from Cincinnati, Ohio, Lisa Mohar is an artist and designer currently based in Brooklyn.  With a clean &amp; ebullient aesthetic, she works in a variety of mediums, including digital, paper cut, illustration, fashion/textile design, and hand lettering.  Before diving into the visual art world, Lisa earned a BFA for vocal performance from The New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music.  She can be found in Williamsburg creating with her French Bulldog at her side.</p>
<p><i>This is only a select few of the people that will be contributing to this project.  Everyone involved will be a Brooklyn based artist, and I'm thrilled to be supporting our community in this way.  I'm also honored to know, and be able to work with such talented creative individuals (not to mention beyond fortunate to call them friends).</i></p>

<h3>About Sweet Medicine</h3>
<p>We are very excited to share the creation of our musical project with you! We are Naia Graham and Emily Lewis and together we are Sweet Medicine! We met at Sound Healing school in San Francisco and each of us felt a deep calling to share our voices in a way that brings beauty into the world. We both had a dream to write and share soul inspired healing music and from the first moment we sang together magic happened! And that was the seed of what we now call Sweet Medicine. To this day when we get together and sing, magic happens. And when people hear us they feel that magic too. A big part of saying YES to making this album is a response to our community continually asking us to make our music available. So that is what we are doing! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to get the album out into the world we need additional funds to cover the following costs: </p>
<ol>
<li>Mixing: $1500 </li>
<li>Mastering: $1000 </li>
<li>Printing &amp; CD duplication and mailing: $750 </li>
<li>Rewards expenses and mailing: $750</li>
</ol>
<p>Total: $4000 </p>
<ul>
<li>Indiegogo Goal: $2000 </li>
<li>We plan to contribute our own resources to cover whatever we don't raise through Indiegogo </li>
</ul>
<p>We have some FUN perks for those of you who feel inspired to donate! Perks include signed copies of the album and a secret sound healing song that isn't on the album! </p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal we will put whatever funds we do raise into the final mixing and mastering costs! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are recording this album as an offering to you, our community! To your heart, and to the part of you that may sometimes get swept away when life feels too busy, overwhelming or stressful...This will be an album of original songs that we hope will inspire your heart to blossom open to the love that’s inside of you, reminding you how truly magnificent and divine you are. Well, we all know that medicine is meant to heal us, make us feel better right? Sweet Medicine is just that! Sweet Medicine is music for your heart, for your soul and for your life! Sweet Medicine is a term that originated as a pure blessing. And that is just what this album is going to be~ a ginormous dose of Sweet Medicine blessings for YOU! You can listen to more of our music here: <a href=""https://www.reverbnation.com/singsweetmedicine"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.reverbnation.com/singsweetmedicine</a></p>

<p>Our challenges are minimal in this final fundraising endeavor. We believe that the power and support of our community will help us reach this final financial goal.

<p><i><strong>We are post graduate students</strong></i> of Ukrainian National Tchaikovsky Academy of Music - <i><strong>Temur Yakubov and Yevhen Levkulych</strong></i>. We are researching and promoting forgotten heritage of Sergei Bortkiewicz (1877-1952), a composer from the city of Kharkov, who suffered from wars and totalitarian regimes all his life. That's why his music remained unknown in Ukraine for many decades.</p>
<p><strong>The Festival of his music will take place in Kyiv, Ukraine from 20 to 24 of March 2017.</strong> It has been our dream for a long time. But it is very hard to get sponsor’s support for startup of classical music in Ukraine.</p>
<p>In such difficult times inviting artists from Europe and USA into Ukraine shows that culture has no any borders.</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>We gather $6000 for:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Air tickets for artists (New York - Kyiv - New York for 2 person and Bari - Kyiv- Bari for 1 person)</li>
<li>Apartments in hotel in Kyiv for artists</li>
<li>Local transport expenses and supply</li>
<li>Rent of Concert hall and Grand piano</li>
<li>Advertising of Festival concerts</li>
</ol>
<p><i><strong>Donations of any amount are welcome and appreciated!</strong></i></p>
<p>If we don't reach $6000 we will organize concerts of Bortkiewicz's music in different cities of Ukraine with local artists. And if we gather more then $6000 we will organize additional concerts of Bortkiewicz's music in Ukraine and abroad.</p>
<p>Our project is almost ready! It waits only financial support for realization.</p>

We are researching and promoting forgotten heritage of Sergei Bortkiewicz (1877-1952), a composer from the city of Kharkov, who suffered from wars and totalitarian regimes all his life. That's why his music remained unknown in Ukraine for many decades.
The Festival of his music will take place in Kyiv, Ukraine from 20 to 24 of March 2017. It has been our dream for a long time. But it is very hard to get sponsor’s support for startup of classical music in Ukraine.
In such difficult times inviting artists from Europe and USA into Ukraine shows that culture has no any borders.

We gather $6000 for:

Air tickets for artists (New York - Kyiv - New York for 2 person and Bari - Kyiv- Bari for 1 person)
Apartments in hotel in Kyiv for artists
Local transport expenses and supply
Rent of Concert hall and Grand piano
Advertising of Festival concerts

Donations of any amount are welcome and appreciated!
If we don't reach $6000 we will organize concerts of Bortkiewicz's music in different cities of Ukraine with local artists. And if we gather more then $6000 we will organize additional concerts of Bortkiewicz's music in Ukraine and abroad.
Our project is almost ready! It waits only financial support for realization.

Along the way I  found myself running my own coffee roasting company. This job provided me with the ability pay for the switch's development and prototypes. It was a great way to learn about manufacturing and distributing a product. I will use these time tested skills to get you your campaign investor rewards.</p><p>Thanks to our engineering team, comprised of retired avionics gurus, and their connections in the electronic manufacturing world, we think this will be a reasonably quick turnaround for the investors. We want to under-promise and over-deliver, but we're guessing it could be as much as 6 to 8 months of hard work to get these made and shipped to you. Hopefully we can make it a shorter turn around. There are often unforeseen slowdowns, setbacks, and unexpected events. We will try to minimize these and satisfy our investors as promptly as possible. </p><p> </p><p><strong>History:</strong></p><p>I first became aware of the standard three pickup electric guitar when I was a kid in high school, in 1974, a friend of mine had one, and together we would take it apart and put it back together. Later as I got into bands and was playing music professionally as a young man, I was constantly fiddling with, and re-wiring my guitars to get new sounds. Eventually I realized I liked the sounds you could get from three pickup guitars best. I just love the soulful twang they produced. </p><p> </p><p>In 1985, I purchased a very innovative new type of guitar. It was a graphite-composite guitar with two humbucking pick ups. It was super modern and had no body or headstock, and I thought it looked cool and would be good for playing gigs around Seattle. As a struggling musician, I had been making money for years as a house painter. By coincidence my next door neighbor needed his cafe painted and we struck a deal: if I could paint the old Phinney Ridge Cafe (single-handedIy I might add) he would give me the $2700 required to buy the guitar. I'll always be grateful to the two Jay's: Jay Coulter who hired me to paint the cafe, and Jay Boone who sold me the guitar. Jay Coulter passed away many years ago, but Jay Boone is still a friend and coincidentally the owner of Seattle's finest vintage guitar store: Emerald City Guitars. </p><p> </p><p>When I finally got the headless, graphite-composite guitar, I was exceptionally happy with the way the guitar played, especially the tremolo arm, but after awhile I missed my three-pickup sound selections, so I called the company who made the guitar, and asked them to make a separate top plate for the guitar with 3  single coil pickups. When the new custom top plate arrived with the three single coil pick ups, I realized I hadn't specified with the manufacturer which type of pickup selector-switch to use. Instead of putting a standard five position lever switch on the top plate like most 3-pickup guitars, they sent it with push-button switches for each of the three pickups. This allowed individual selection of each pickup, or any combination of the three. I was quite amazed by this unexpected innovation, because this gave me 8 choices for my pick up selections. I marveled at this idea for sometime: that there were actually eight pick up combinations on a three pick up guitar. As a long-time user of three pickup guitars it dawned on me: wouldn't it be a great thing if you could buy an eight position selector switch for any three pick up guitar? I looked at all of the available catalogs and magazines (this was 1985, there was NO google yet!) to try to find out what was available and there was nothing like it available. To this day, 32 years later, the same is true, such a thing is still classified as ""unobtainium"". Never fear, I'm trying to make The Seattle Super Switch 8-Way Tone Shifter a reality for you and your guitar!</p><p> </p><p>In 2006 I was introduced to my chief engineer, a veteran of Seattle's airplane/avionics industry. This highly experienced pro took my ideas to the drawing board and prototype stage. Over the course of the last 11 years or so, we made many different prototypes, and eventually realized my dream of an 8  position pickup switch. Though the initial switch prototypes worked well, I started to realize there were a lot of things that needed improving on the conventional switches. Bringing the 8 positions to the switch was only part of the problem. Through the initial trial and discovery phase of this project I realized that historically, on existing 5-way switches, the bridge pick up was never given access to the tone adjustment circuit, therefore it's brittle and bright tone could never be adjusted. And why were none of the wiring terminals marked? How confusing! Why was the whole switch open and not protected from dust? Why should we be forced to use molten hot solder to hook up the wires on beautiful wood guitars? How many times has a guitar been damaged by this medieval practice? What about solid body and hollow body guitars with no slot for the lever of the switch? They were often burdened with the most limited choice of all: the antiquated 3-position switch. Why was there no ""off position""? </p><p>Together we created solutions to all of these issues and a couple more, and finalized our design and sent it off to the patent office. </p><p> </p><p>The whole time I've been in Seattle, I've played its bars, taverns, and nightclubs in a number of bands. I have been using Seattle Super Switch prototypes in each of my four electric guitars for about 4 years now and I am in love with this magical little switch. It's so exciting to have all of the innovations and the new sounds. </p><p> </p><p> Investor dollars will be put toward;</p><ul>

</ul><p>We have an agreement with a small manufacturing entity in Seattle to share their facilities and staff. Once the components are manufactured, assembly, testing, and fulfillment should be fairly routine.</p><p> </p><p>Our examination of the guitar switch industry shows the cheapest of the cheap switches going for $6 - $10. The more expensive boutique quality going for $55 and up. The Seattle Super Switch 8-Way Tone Shifter will retail for $40. Our Indiegogo investors will get theirs for $30 plus shipping. There are other pricing configurations for investors, based on volume. We have additional perks too. We realize some folks don't have any need for musical instrument accessories or upgrades, so we've got some other fun things unrelated to guitars for them on the way, so check back with the campaign as it develops. </p><p>Please check this campaign thoroughly for more videos and information, especially the ones that contain the sounds!</p><p> </p><p><u><i><strong>Thank you for taking the time to read about the history of this campaign.

What about solid body and hollow body guitars with no slot for the lever of the switch? They were often burdened with the most limited choice of all: the antiquated 3-position switch. Why was there no ""off position""? Together we created solutions to all of these issues and a couple more, and finalized our design and sent it off to the patent office.  The whole time I've been in Seattle, I've played its bars, taverns, and nightclubs in a number of bands. I have been using Seattle Super Switch prototypes in each of my four electric guitars for about 4 years now and I am in love with this magical little switch. It's so exciting to have all of the innovations and the new sounds.   Investor dollars will be put toward;
injection molding 
circuitry components 
metal actuator lever fabrication 
small parts acquisition & assembly 
testing
packaging and shipping.
We have an agreement with a small manufacturing entity in Seattle to share their facilities and staff. Once the components are manufactured, assembly, testing, and fulfillment should be fairly routine. Our examination of the guitar switch industry shows the cheapest of the cheap switches going for $6 - $10. The more expensive boutique quality going for $55 and up. The Seattle Super Switch 8-Way Tone Shifter will retail for $40. Our Indiegogo investors will get theirs for $30 plus shipping. There are other pricing configurations for investors, based on volume. We have additional perks too. We realize some folks don't have any need for musical instrument accessories or upgrades, so we've got some other fun things unrelated to guitars for them on the way, so check back with the campaign as it develops. Please check this campaign thoroughly for more videos and information, especially the ones that contain the sounds! Thank you for taking the time to read about the history of this campaign. Please share this with your friends and don't forget we need your contribution!  With Gratitude, The Seattle Super Switch Team",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I pour my heart and soul into these songs, which give me a voice and allow me a form of expression that takes me out of this world. I really want to share it with everyone else! I'm ready to sing and dance my heart out.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Making good music can be very expensive and releasing it in the right way requires hiring the right people. That's why I need your help. I have them listening but doing all of this without the support of a record label comes at a heavy cost. If you help me I promise I will make it worth your while!</p>
<p>You have several rewards to choose from in exchange for your generosity; digital MP3s, exclusive cassette tapes, t-shirts, pins, totes, VIP concert packages, and personalized perks as well. You get to breathe life to a really incredible project!</p>
<p>All of the funds raised will go towards funding the Night Window EP.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It's really simple, I want to take this labor of love and share it with the world. I've got some travelling to do and shows to play! I know some rad people all over this planet and when I come to your town I want you to be entertained. This campaign will allow me to make the traction in the world that I need to do that!</p>
<p>The success of my 2015 Kickstarter fund help me to record and mix 6 tracks, which allowed me to catch the attention of other musicians and producers and develop a dream team of talented people who believe in this music and this performance. If this campaign is funded I'll be able to move on to the next step! Which, honestly, just means that I'll be able to put something out there that I'm proud of. Something that truly represents me</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It's not easy getting people's attention. You have to be a little crazy, maybe show some skin, but ultimately give them something quality they can get into. This music is that thing! Something beautifully weird happens when I take it to the dancefloor. We always have a good time. I know that when I apply the magic of this music to the dynamics of the stage that some extra level shit will take place. Trust.</p>
<p>All I need is a little nudge! The rest is truly gonna be gravy.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please don't get the wrong idea! Financial contributions aren't everything. The entire spirit of my music is in sharing it with the world! Maybe your friends would dig it... Link them to this campaign! The collective power of people is what gives any and all art a pulse, and this is no different.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and your support &lt;3</p>

<p>The Creative Commons is close to our hearts. The Seattle Star would not be possible without it, and every article we've ever published carries a Creative Commons license to help users share quality journalism freely.</p>
<p>The challenge of the Creative Commons is that too few people know of it, and even fewer understand it. Article after article has been written about ""free culture"" and ""open source"" and ""sharing economy"" and so on, yet the struggle remains. So when Ryan Merkley of Creative Commons implored us all to help ""light up the commons,"" we took him very seriously.</p>
<p>Rather than write another article, we decided to show you. In person. Face to face. Because nothing will show you the depth, diversity and beauty of the Commons like seeing the artists, hearing the music, viewing the films, playing the games, reading the books that are only possible because of our belief in a shared culture and a better world.</p>
<p>We are bringing to you a year-long series of Creative Commons art, music, literature, games, and cinema and we want your help.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our plan is eventually to bring to Seattle Creative Commons musicians and artists from all over. Right now we are starting locally, and small. We are asking for $2,500 to cover the costs of the venues and to pay the artists so that they can keep performing and making the music we love. As we start looking to book national and international acts in the future the premise will remain the same: pay the venues, pay the artists.</p>
<p>And since we are a community, we aim to do something for you, too. We want EVERYONE who attends to come away with something from the Commons: a playlist, a sticker, a shirt, a CD (they do make those still, yes?), a print, an artwork, an album, a book. Even people who attend our shows for free will still receive something. A small amount of the proceeds will go to covering this material.</p>
<p>Whatever we get beyond our intitial goal goes to the artists,</p>
<p>We are asking for your help in getting this snowball rolling until it's finally unstoppable.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will help inspire the artists to make more art. That is no small matter. Artists give up every day from feeling a lack of support.</p>
<p>But it does more. It shows a faith not just in the artists but in their dedication to building a shared culture: a culture where music is not locked up by people in suits, where literature and reviews are easily accessible to scholars regardless of whether or not their opnions are popular, where digital images that are infinitely reproducible are not made artificially scarce because a gallery owner wants it that way. All art is built on other art. If people do not have ready access to art, where will the art of the future come from?</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The first month of events has already been scheduled, and the time is near. The greatest challenge, as always, is getting the word out. We can always reach our friends, but we want to reach everyone. The more people who use the commons, the stronger it becomes.</p>
<p>We plan on having all our merchandise ready for the Feb. 2nd show, but the t-shirts may take a little longer. All of the gifts we have for our audience are already set. Perks are perks, and will be taken care of at the close of the campaign.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you cannot contribute monetarily right now, we still need you.</p>
<p>Share this campaign with people you know, even the ones you think aren't interested. You might be surprised.</p>
<p>Get hip with the Commons. We have an extensive reading and viewing list to show you what's up. If we can show you the allure of the commons reaches from Paulo Coelho, Cory Doctorow, Nine Inch Nails, Chuck D, and The Beastie Boys all the way down to the humblest 12-year-old putting together her latest YouTube video, then you can help convince others.</p>

<p><strong>Dearest family, friends, fans and loved ones,</strong><br/>     As many of you know, 2017 was an intense year of change for me! One of the ways I coped with this change was by challenging myself to write and record a worship song every week for a year.  I wanted to do something that allowed me to look back on 2017 with joy and gratitude instead of with bitterness and sadness.  What better way to do that than to write 52 songs about how great God is?! It forced me to put my mind into a place of worship and, let me tell you, it worked! After I finished my 52nd song I knew that I wasn't done with the project. I decided to take the best 10 of these songs and record a full album to really solidify the challenge and the exercise of turning a hard time in life into a time of gratefulness!  To do this, though, I really need some financial help.<br/>    This is why I am asking you to help me fund my debut album, which I would LOVE to release in the Winter of 2018. I have a crazy long list of ""to do’s"" to be able to accomplish this goal and I've spent the last few months developing relationships with the pros who can help me make this happen. I'm finally ready!</p>
<p><strong>Full Disclosure: </strong><br/>     I got started without ya'll! I invested a few thousand dollars and went down to Nashville to record a song as proof that the album will sound amazing. I had so much fun working on it and learned a ton in the process. I wanted to make sure that I COULD do it and make sure I had all of the right people in place before I launched this campaign. Take a listen via the video above. The song is called Fearless Lamb. I'm confident that you will love how it turned out as much as I do. <br/><br/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><strong>Why Does It Cost So Much???</strong></span><br/><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>     Making an album correctly is not a cheap process. Every step demands a significant amount of money, especially when you are blessed enough to be working with the best of the best! My standards both for myself and for my music are high, and, with your help, I will be able to hold my worship music to the highest standard. </span><br/>     ALSO, it is SO important to me that people are paid well. Paying people well and being fair financially, for me, is an important part of living out my Christian values. I refuse to ask anyone to ""just chip in"" without paying them what they ask and need. This is my first professional music project and I want to kick it off correctly, treating all of the musicians, producers, engineers, mixers, studio space owners, and everyone involved with respect and fairness when it comes to paying them.</p>
<p><strong>Where Will the Money Go?</strong><br/>      Let me go into some more detail about how creating a music album works. Here are some of the things your support would go toward. If you think this stuff is boring, scroll down to skip it and learn about fun rewards :)</p>

<li>
<i><strong>Pre-production</strong></i>: Meeting with my producer and other musicians to develop the acoustic songs into full band productions</li>

<i><strong>Studio time and production: </strong></i>This includes hiring studio musicians, teaching them the songs, recording them, re-recording them, and then revising things. It also includes my own studio time playing guitar and singing. It also includes the producer and engineer's time and dedication as well as their musical connections.</li>
<li>
<i><strong>Mixing and mastering:</strong></i> This process takes hours and is done for each song individually and then for the album as a whole. My first single was mixed and mastered by a grammy award winning Christian audio engineer and working with him was pivotal to how well it turned out.</li>
<li>
<i><strong>Studio Musicians:</strong></i> In just the very first song, there were drums, guitars, strings, a choir, bass, piano, vocals, and electronic sounds. I will be working with only the best for each part being played on each song. These people expect to be paid for their expertise and I want to treat them well as they are the ones really bringing my songs to life!</li>
<li>
<i><strong>Single release, product production, and marketing: </strong></i>Don't forget that I'll actually need to release the music digitally to the world and create and print cd's etc. Just having the online ability to give music to people in so many different platforms can be costly.</li>

<p><strong>GenRyu Arts</strong> is a community based nonprofit (501)(c)(3) organization in San Francisco’s Japantown dedicated to fostering cultural and artistic growth within our community and building pride in our heritage. GenRyu Arts has served over 300,000 people through public performances, taiko and dance classes, and school-site residencies.</p>
<p><strong>We have taught over 10,000 children</strong> directly through our satellite programs, donated over 2,000 performances to the San Francisco community, programmed guest artists to teach minyo (Japanese folk music and dance), martial arts, shodo (Japanese brush painting), poetry, jazz, shamisen (3 string instrument), and taiko (Japanese drums) from Japan and Chicago.</p>
<p><strong>An Invitation to You!</strong></p>
<p>We aim to raise $25,000 for our 2018 programming. For Indiegogo we're setting our goal at <strong>$10,000</strong> to help get us there. That money will support:</p>
<p>1. Bringing <strong>master artists out from Japan and Chicago</strong> this summer for Japan Week (includes airfare and hotel stays)</p>
<p>2. Providing<strong> upgrade of equipment and costumes</strong> -taiko drums, shamisen (3 string instrument), bachi (drum sticks), drum carts, drum stands, happi (traditional Japanese jackets), kimono (traditional Japanese costume).</p>
<p>3. Allowing us to continue to build on <strong>Japan Day Festival </strong>set for<strong> July 1st</strong> (showcase of traditional and modern Japanese cultural arts)</p>
<p>4. Offering free workshops, performances, and activities to the public during <strong>Japan Week 6/25 - 7/1/18.</strong></p>
<p>5. Supporting the <strong>World Premiere</strong> of a new interdisciplinary work entitled <strong>“Boxes”</strong>, which will be performed<strong> Friday - Saturday, 6/29 - 6/30/18</strong>. “Boxes”, referencing the work of Japanese writer and political activist Kobo Abe, will be a 45 minute performance piece featuring musician/dancer <strong>Melody Takata</strong>, saxophonist <strong>Francis Wong</strong>, tuba player <strong>William Roper</strong> of Los Angeles, bassist, shamisen, taiko artist, and filmmaker <strong>Tatsu Aoki </strong>of Chicago &amp; Grandmaster of the nagauta (Kabuki style) shamisen <strong>Chizuru Kineya </strong>of Tokyo. The work will integrate traditional and contemporary music, Japanese dance, and video projection in <strong>celebrating Genryu Arts 23th Anniversary Season.</strong></p> <p><strong>Why we turned to Indiegogo for help</strong></p>
<p>Since we are a nonprofit organization a lot of our money comes from grants and weekly lessons. We have a combination of teaching residencies, professional and community performances, our school site at Japanese Cultural and Community Center of Northern California (JCCCNC), and we tour nationally.

</div></div>","GenRyu Arts is a community based nonprofit (501)(c)(3) organization in San Francisco’s Japantown dedicated to fostering cultural and artistic growth within our community and building pride in our heritage. GenRyu Arts has served over 300,000 people through public performances, taiko and dance classes, and school-site residencies.
We have taught over 10,000 children directly through our satellite programs, donated over 2,000 performances to the San Francisco community, programmed guest artists to teach minyo (Japanese folk music and dance), martial arts, shodo (Japanese brush painting), poetry, jazz, shamisen (3 string instrument), and taiko (Japanese drums) from Japan and Chicago.
An Invitation to You!
We aim to raise $25,000 for our 2018 programming. For Indiegogo we're setting our goal at $10,000 to help get us there. That money will support:
1. Bringing master artists out from Japan and Chicago this summer for Japan Week (includes airfare and hotel stays)
2. Providing upgrade of equipment and costumes -taiko drums, shamisen (3 string instrument), bachi (drum sticks), drum carts, drum stands, happi (traditional Japanese jackets), kimono (traditional Japanese costume).
3. Allowing us to continue to build on Japan Day Festival set for July 1st (showcase of traditional and modern Japanese cultural arts)
4. Offering free workshops, performances, and activities to the public during Japan Week 6/25 - 7/1/18.
5. Supporting the World Premiere of a new interdisciplinary work entitled “Boxes”, which will be performed Friday - Saturday, 6/29 - 6/30/18. “Boxes”, referencing the work of Japanese writer and political activist Kobo Abe, will be a 45 minute performance piece featuring musician/dancer Melody Takata, saxophonist Francis Wong, tuba player William Roper of Los Angeles, bassist, shamisen, taiko artist, and filmmaker Tatsu Aoki of Chicago & Grandmaster of the nagauta (Kabuki style) shamisen Chizuru Kineya of Tokyo. The work will integrate traditional and contemporary music, Japanese dance, and video projection in celebrating Genryu Arts 23th Anniversary Season. Why we turned to Indiegogo for help
Since we are a nonprofit organization a lot of our money comes from grants and weekly lessons. We have a combination of teaching residencies, professional and community performances, our school site at Japanese Cultural and Community Center of Northern California (JCCCNC), and we tour nationally. Due to the growing demand of our programming and artistic services, we are turning to crowdfunding to help offset the increasing costs of all the major work we’ve been carrying out over the last 23 years.
This is a critical year for us, the city, and this country, and through the support of this fundraising campaign, we want to make it significant and empowering for everyone.
Help us continue providing a place for the next generation to witness, learn, develop as artists themselves, and be inspired by what we share. Taiko and dance are the heartbeat and song of our bodies individually and collectively.
Let us move forward together in this time of unsettling uncertainty, into a stronger, more committed, more compassionate and empathetic collective community.
As a gesture of gratitude, we are offering thank you letters, window clings, t-shirts, Melody Takata CDs, VIP access to Boxes, Recognition name plate engraved on GenRyu Arts equipment. You can always help us by donating to us directly at genryuarts.org. Or start by sending an email to info@genryuarts.org with any and all inquiries.

<p>Music has always had a cathartic affect on me.

<h2>It's Never Too Late*</h2>
<p>Have you ever said to yourself: I'm too old to... (fill in the blank)?</p>
<p>Well, I did. A friend gave me a guitar for my birthday years ago. I had always wanted to play the guitar, but there it sat on the shelf -- for all of those years.* </p>
<p>And then I realized: ""the youngest I'll be is how old I am now.""* If I really want to play the guitar, I'd better get started. And so I did... at age 58. </p>
<p>Slowly, I learned several songs by artists I love, like Cat Stevens, Donovan, as well as contemporary musicians like Shawn Colvin and Aimee Mann. But I had not found my true voice until June (2016), when I went through a somewhat traumatic event, a court case gone unpredictably and terribly wrong.</p>
<p>I had no other way to process it than to write about it, and out came ""Winner In My Mind.""* Shortly after, I used song-writing to process the death of my father last year, and out came ""Sad Songs for a Gentle Old Man.""* Since June, I've written 17 songs... and they continue to pour out of me!</p>
<h3><strong>We Can Do This Together </strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>The process of making a CD involves a ton of time and talent. I hired a producer: the amazing and talented Courtney Yasmineh, recording/mixing engineer: Rob Genadek, Dean Magraw on lead guitar and Michael Bissonnette on percussion. I play rhythm guitar and sing my songs. On Sept. 19, we spent one enchanted evening (6 1/2 hours) recording four of my original songs. Everyone loved the songs and you can tell, because what emerged was absolutely magical! </p>
<p>We will need to book at least two more studio sessions when we'll record six more of my original songs and two ""covers."" Here's the song line-up for this CD (the first four songs have already been recorded):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i><strong>It's Never Too Late</strong></i> (my theme song)</li>
<li>
<i><strong>Roadside Assistance</strong></i> (a song about love gone wrong)</li>
<li>
<i><strong>Serendipity or When in Rome </strong></i>(a quirky song exploring questions of love and fate)</li>
<li>
<i><strong>The Accidental Tourists</strong></i> (an uplifting song that will make you dance for joy)</li>
<li> <i><strong>War With No Name</strong></i> (a political song written the day after the Orlando nightclub shooting about the need for gun control)</li>
<li>
<i><strong>My Last Drink</strong></i> (a really fun ""un-drinking"" song)</li>
<li>
<i><strong>A Different Kind of Normal </strong></i>(a song about my daughter's struggle with bi-polar disorder)</li>
<li>
<i><strong>Sad Songs for a Gentle Old Man</strong></i> (a song for my dad who died on Oct. 4, 2015)</li>
<li>
<i><strong>Teleportation for Two</strong></i> (a love song written in Florence, Italy in July 2016)</li>
<li>
<i><strong>Winner In My Mind </strong></i>(see above, a song of thanks and empowerment)</li>
<li>
<i><strong>Riki Tiki Tavi</strong></i> (one of my favorite Donovan songs)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why I Need You</h3>
<p>In total, this project will cost around $10,000. I have committed to paying half and am depending on your generosity and support for the other half. </p>
<ul>
<li>I greatly appreciate any support you can give (""You believed in me... And that's all that I need""*). If you can't give, would you please share my campaign?</li>
<li>Naturally, anyone who can contribute will be the first to get a copy of my debut CD. </li>
<li>At a higher level of support ($500+), I can promise the best seats anywhere I play (OK, so it might be at Harriet Brewing, but you just never know!)</li>
<li>At an even higher level of support ($1,000+), I will play a private concert for you and your friends. </li>
<li>At the highest level of support ($2,500+), I will write an original song for you, on any theme you choose!</li>
</ul>
<p>My gift is my music -- for my family and friends, for you... and for a world that needs music that truly comes from the heart. </p>

Why I Need You
In total, this project will cost around $10,000. I have committed to paying half and am depending on your generosity and support for the other half. 

I greatly appreciate any support you can give (""You believed in me... And that's all that I need""*). If you can't give, would you please share my campaign?
Naturally, anyone who can contribute will be the first to get a copy of my debut CD. 
At a higher level of support ($500+), I can promise the best seats anywhere I play (OK, so it might be at Harriet Brewing, but you just never know!)
At an even higher level of support ($1,000+), I will play a private concert for you and your friends. 
At the highest level of support ($2,500+), I will write an original song for you, on any theme you choose!

My gift is my music -- for my family and friends, for you... and for a world that needs music that truly comes from the heart.

It's Never Too Late
Lyrics and Music © Maria Verven
Capo – 3rd fret      
Intro: D D C Em / D D C G / C G Am Am / C G D D
D                                    C                            Em
It's never too late to start something new
D                                C                    G
Play the guitar or wear a new 'do
C                              G                  Am
The youngest I'll be is how old I am now
C                                 G               D
There's no guarantees and no sacred cows
Refrain
Am                                         D
No more waiting for my life to begin
Am                                G      Em                 D
No more pining for what might have been
D                                                          C                   Em
People get stuck or don't they mind it that way?
D                                              C                    G
Down in their ruts where they tend to stay
C                         G              Am
The same old grind is a trap that they built
C                            G                     D
It's in their own minds from sloth or from guilt
Refrain
D                                         C         Em
My path in this life has never been straight
D                                               C                    G
Struggles and strife have made me afraid
C           G                             Am
Finally one day though riddled with pain
C             G                D
Tired of waiting, I started to play 
 
D                                        C                    Em
Guitar on the shelf for all of those years
D                                      C                          G
Surprising myself, it brought me to tears
C                       G                           Am
Let loose the beast that was lurking inside
C                          G                      D
I pray it won't cease 'til the day that I die

<h3>My life, my passion</h3>
<p>Throughout this life, Sri Mridanga has been my spiritual connection, practice and offering. Taking shelter of the Vedic traditions, I guide students in exploring mridanga as an expression and development of their essential nature. Having spent more than a decade in India, studying the spiritual background, principles and techniques of mridanga playing under the living masters, I am here to celebrate, educate and support all levels of interest.</p>
<h3>The Vision</h3>
<p><strong>Celebrating and preserving the mridanga tradition </strong></p>
<p>In this unique musical tradition rhythm is explored in its totality. The spiritual phenomenon of rhythm, the structural dynamics of aesthetic expression and development of masterful physical technique are seamlessly interwoven into the study and performance of this divine musical art.  </p>
<p>The mridanga tradition showcases the vedic ideal that one's occupational study and expression is meant to provoke a deep sense of spiritual satisfaction and scientific understanding. </p>
<p>This is the antidote to the materialism of the modern age. </p>
<p>I will travel to Kolkata to research archives and gather the elder masters' wisdom and technical insights as well as create audio &amp; video recordings, which exemplify this richly developed sacred art, before it goes extinct. Thus, I will compile and publish a definitive book along with a set of recorded media, making this valuable material widely available to interested parties, as well as for placement in the Library of Congress and other historical and educational institutions worldwide.</p>
<p>As this is the first time Mridanga is finding interest internationally, there is an urgent need for a standard reference book on Mridanga in English, not only to give access to this profound wisdom in the modern context, but to insure that it is not lost to posterity. During this last year, I have given many lessons, workshops, lectures and performances around the world. This has created a strong demand for regular education in communities around the world who share my enthusiasm and love for Mridanga, as an integral part of Vedic India's spiritual culture.</p>

<h3>Mridanga, one of the world’s most ancient sacred drums, is in danger of being lost to us</h3>
<p>The Vedic understanding can be seen as a wheel of knowledge, whose hub is formed by the five principle subjects of (Brahma-Vidya) spiritual science:  [Isvara (God), Jiva (the soul), Prakriti (nature), kala (time) and karma (activity)]. The spokes of this wheel are the translation of this divine cosmology into our roles in society.</p>
<p>Thus, in the Vedic art of Mridanga, elaborate study of rhythmic technique and composition serves to develop the drummers spiritual realisation, transforming their musical performance into their unique, personal expression of absolute truth and beauty.</p>
<p>This subject has yet to be fully represented in literature, as an integral discipline. In this unique musical tradition, rhythm is explored in its totality. The spiritual phenomenon of rhythm, the structural dynamics of aesthetic expression and development of masterful physical technique are seamlessly interwoven into its study and performance.</p>
</div><div><p>With your generous support, this obscured art, the Vedic tradition of Mridanga will be preserved.</p></div><div>
<h3>Here, my mridanga guru, Hare Krishna Halder, Mahashaya shares some historic and cultural perspectives on mridanga culture. </h3>

<h3>More About Bhima-Karma</h3>
<p>Throughout this life, Sri Mridanga has been my spiritual connection, practice and offering. My parents were both initiated by the late Bhaktivedanta Svami Prabhupada, who founded the western “Krsna” movement in the 60’s and 70’s. It was a uniquely colorful, creative, contrasted and inspired group, with it’s new spiritual roots in the most essential traditions of ancient India and a decidedly contrasted modern west, searching for resolution to its own cultural identity outside its stifled sense of traditional values. Needless to say, my young life was a dramatic array of our parents’ attempts to express their burgeoning spiritual connection and ancient Krsna-centered cosmology in the temple and farm communities we lived in.</p>
<p>Our common group activity and spiritual practice is “kirtan”. Some of you may know, its the Sanskrit word for the common human practice of chanting and singing to/about/for God/Krsna. The Vedic/Indian flavor includes small resonant metal cymbals called “kartala”, which make muted or resonant ringing bell sounds to keep the beat, which is then thunderously rendered by the clay-bodied drum, called the mridanga. A leader will first sing the chant or line of the song and the whole group will respond in tune, with all the cymbals/kartalas and mridanga drums binding it all together and evoking a jubilant mood. Its an interesting mix of deep musical possibility and traditional information and absence of strict musical rules, as the goal is to set a stage which invites and invokes the expression of everyone’s spiritual relationship with Krsna/God.</p>
<p>As many of the young boys jumping and singing in the kirtans, I instantly loved the booming mridanga. As a young boy, the opposite ends of the drum could scarcely be reached by both my hands. So my 2nd birthday present from my mother was a mridanga drum that was just my size. My mother fashioned one from a round Quaker oatmeal box. Thus my career in mridanga began.</p>
<p>While many of my fellow boys moved on as adults, my fascination deepened and remains the steady source of cultivation and means of expression in my life. I couldn’t know with my simple boyhood love, the fathomless depth of this venerable vedic grandfather of drums.</p>
<p>As a young man of 22, I had already toured and recorded 2 albums with Krishna Das (now famous among many yoga/Kirtan groups) and had the quickly ascending excitement of yoga and kirtan in the USA before me. But my heart always had a calling to go up to the source mountain streams of the world’s ancient spiritual music culture and knowledge. As a young man who had lost his father while only a 6 year old, who’s mother had no stable home or clear guidance, who’s community was still struggling to resolve its conflict between its often fanatical approach to Krsna and the creation of a functional economy to support spiritual development, I saved enough money from my job managing “Lucky’s Juice Joint” in Soho, NYC to make my first trip to India. It was my biggest decision yet and I needed to take a test run to see if studying mridanga was just an idealistic fantasy or if it really was my soul’s call.</p>
<p>As soon as I came off the plane, I felt home. Being raised as a vaisnava-monk through my childhood, with stories of ancient Indian heroes, goddesses and Krsna himself, the most captivating person, the different look in my eye and spring in my step always had me feeling appreciated as colorfully unique, yet out of place. Here, although I was a tall white guy, I felt at home with the smells and cloth, the ready recognition of divinity in the ordinary and the common knowledge of Krsna as the supremely sweet personality of God.</p>
<p>I quickly discovered that this mridanga drum, which was a “given” in the temple kirtans of my boyhood, was a relic of India’s ancient past. Even traveling to its cultural center in west-Bengal, I could not find among expert players a single scholarly teacher able to convey the musical system all of it was forming around.</p>
<p>So I settled for the one I found who was teaching in English near the ISKCON temple in Vrindavan, UP. Its the village famous for being Krsna’s childhood home and thus a preeminent historical and spiritual place.</p>
<p>As I began my studies, learning the rudimentary “mantras” or syllabic spoken notations to guide drum strokes, I undertook a gradually ascending practice routine which brought me to 6 hours a day of practice by the end of the second month. I was not only addicted, hooked and in love, it was an unmistakably mystical experience. I was markedly “present”; there was nowhere else I dreamt of being, nothing else I yearned to do, which I didn’t believe would be achieved through this deeply satisfying practice and all it included and meant. I kept a journal to give voice to the many overflowing realizations of universal secrets, which came as over-plentiful fruits of my daily practice.</p>
<p>Since that initial 9 months in 1999, I studied for 6-7 years under my first teacher, Bablu Das Mahashay and then under my Mridanga Guru, Sriman Hare-Krishna, Halder PHD.</p>
<p>It is an astounding discovery of a culture, a way of approaching life and education, which had long ago disposed of the universal want for scientific systematic presentation of a subject and a way of imbibing that subject which naturally brings about deep knowledge of all things and most remarkably, oneself.</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/><strong><u>English</u></strong><strong> </strong>➡   My name is Sarah and I am a young musician from Germany. Looking back over the last two decades, I've become familiar with many different aspects of music. With a background in classical music learning violin, organ, and piano, as well as conducting and singing, I’ve become interested in pop music and music software. Inspired by influences as diverse as Bach and Britney, I continued to follow my inner path, discovering many different styles of singing, as well as various genres of music. Breaking out of a long-term writer's block, I began to write pop and R&amp;B songs right from my heart.</p>
</div></div>
<p><br/><strong><u>Deutsch</u></strong> ➡ Mein Name ist Sarah und ich bin eine Musikerin aus Deutschland. Hinter mir liegen zwei Jahrzehnte in denen ich sehr viele verschiedene Facetten der Musik kennengelernt habe. Von Geige, Orgel, Klavier, Dirigieren über den klassischen Gesang zu Popgesang und zur Musiksoftware. Hin- und hergerissen zwischen Bach und Britney. Angezogen von elektronischen Beats und großen Stimmen habe ich mich nach einer längeren Schreibblockade auf den Weg gemacht und Pop/RnB-Songs direkt über meine Gefühlswelt geschrieben.</p>

Creating a CD and a music video will help me to reach out to a bigger audience and focus even more on my music.
 

Who am I/Wer ich bin
 
English ➡   My name is Sarah and I am a young musician from Germany. Looking back over the last two decades, I've become familiar with many different aspects of music. With a background in classical music learning violin, organ, and piano, as well as conducting and singing, I’ve become interested in pop music and music software. Inspired by influences as diverse as Bach and Britney, I continued to follow my inner path, discovering many different styles of singing, as well as various genres of music. Breaking out of a long-term writer's block, I began to write pop and R&B songs right from my heart.

Deutsch ➡ Mein Name ist Sarah und ich bin eine Musikerin aus Deutschland. Hinter mir liegen zwei Jahrzehnte in denen ich sehr viele verschiedene Facetten der Musik kennengelernt habe. Von Geige, Orgel, Klavier, Dirigieren über den klassischen Gesang zu Popgesang und zur Musiksoftware. Hin- und hergerissen zwischen Bach und Britney. Angezogen von elektronischen Beats und großen Stimmen habe ich mich nach einer längeren Schreibblockade auf den Weg gemacht und Pop/RnB-Songs direkt über meine Gefühlswelt geschrieben.
 

 
 
My Project/Mein Vorhaben
 
 ​English ➡ 

Working together with my wonderful producer Torsten Schroth  (http://www.proton-leipzig.de/) I will create a CD with at least five of my songs, which will be available as a digital and physical copy. The number of songs might increase, depending on the amount of  financial support you can give.
 I feel so honored that one of my favorite digital artists, Archan Nair (http://www.archann.net/), and the photographer Benjamin Anbau (http://benjaminphotography.de/) will create a beautiful album cover!
The professional talented filmmaker Björn Kowalewsky (https://helldunkel-produktionen.de/) will produce a music video of the first released single of the CD. 
A radio promotion is planned. 

 
Deutsch ➡

Zusammen mit meinem tollen Produzenten Torsten Schroth (http://www.proton-leipzig.de/) werde ich eine CD mit mindestens fünf Songs produzieren, welche als digitale und als physische Kopie erhältlich sein wird. Falls eure finanzielle Unterstützung deutlich über das Finanzierungsziel fällt, werde ich noch weitere Songs hinzunehmen können. 
Ich habe die Ehre, dass Archan Nair (http://www.archann.net/), einer meiner absoluten Lieblingskünstler, zusammen mit dem Fotographen Benjamin Anbau ((http://benjaminphotography.de/) das Albumcover gestalten wird! 
Für die erste Singeauskopplung der CD wird mithilfe von Björn Kowalewsky (https://helldunkel-produktionen.de) ein professionelles Musikvideo entstehen.
Eine Radiopromotion ist geplant.

$ Finances/Finanzierung $
 
English ➡ The cost of my production comes to almost €20,000. I will be able to cover a part of it through my job, but it will take me longer than two years. Unfortunately that will leave me little time for my music and low on cash for my living expenses. You've got the chance to help me achieve a bigger and more beautiful goal faster and with less stress! As a THANKYOU you'll be getting the CD before everybody else and of course you'll get to pick all other gifts I offer. 
 
YOU ALSO HAVE THE OPTION TO DONATE AN AMOUNT OF YOUR CHOICE!
Deutsch ➡ Die Gesamtkosten meiner Produktion belaufen sich auf knappe 20.000€. Einen Teil davon finanziere ich selber durch meinen Job. Jedoch wird es auf diese Weise länger als zwei Jahre dauern, in denen ich wenig Zeit für meine Musik und wenig Budget für meinen Alltag zur Verfügung haben werde. Ihr könnt mir dabei helfen der Welt eine außergewöhnliche Musik zu zeigen, die Ohrwurm Charakter hat, hochwertig ist, nah an der Ader der Zeit ist und aus dem Herzen spricht. Als Dankeschön werdet ihr die CD vor allen anderen erhalten und könnt euch natürlich etwas aus den Belohnungspaketen aussuchen. 
IHR KÖNNT AUCH UNTER ""UNTERSTÜTZEN"" EINEN BELIEBEN BETRAG AN MICH SENDEN!
    Perks/Geschenke 

 
 
English ➡ CD's, T-Shirts and Bags Working together with fantastic artists such as Benjamin Anbau (http://benjaminphotography.de/) and Archan Nair (http://www.archann.net/), I'll be able to offer a very creative and artistic Album Cover as well as T-Shirts and Bags. Have a look at some of the pictures Archan has created so far. They are just examples but they will help you to get a rough idea of what the CD, T-Shirts and Bags will look like. The final result will be based on my personal ideas, a picture taken by Benjamin and Archan's personal style. You'll also be able to book me for a concert in your home.
 
FURTHERMORE, I'LL BE OFFERING MORE PERKS DURING THE LAUNCHING PERIOD. STAY TUNED!

Deutsch ➡ CD's, T-Shirts und BeutelDurch die Zusammenarbeit mit den Künstlern Benjamin Anbau (http://benjaminphotography.de/) und Archan Nair ((http://www.archann.net/) wird ein sehr künstlerisches Albumcover entstehen. Dieses Motiv wird dann auch auf den T-Shirts und Beuteln zu sehen sein. Über diesem Abschnitt könnt ihr von Archan ein paar bisherigen Arbeiten ansehen und einen ungefähren Eindruck bekommen, wie das CD-Cover, die T-Shirts und die Beutel aussehen werden. Das Endergebnis wird auf Basis meiner persönlichen Ideen, einem Foto von Benjamin und dem individuellen Stil von Archan entstehen.Außerdem könnt ihr mich für ein Wohnzimmerkonzert zu euch nach Hause buchen!
 
IM LAUFE DER KAMPAGNE WIRD ES VON ZEIT ZU ZEIT NEUE GESCHENKPACKETE GEBEN. SCHAUT ALSO ÖFTER MAL HIER REIN!
 

Risks and Advantages/Risiken und Vorteile
 
English ➡  Since this project has a flexible funding goal, every cent helps me reach my goal. However, if we reach less than €1,000, not all of the textile perks will be available. In this case you'll be able to vote for your favorite perk and I'll add something low-budget but special for you. But one thing is for sure: you'll get the Album! Of course we also have the possibility of exceeding the funding goal. In this case I'll be able to add some more perks! If we reach more than €5,000  everyone who donated €70 or more will be able to receive a free Vinyl as well! 
Deutsch ➡  Da es sich bei dieser Kampagne um ein flexibles Förderungsziel handelt, wird mir jeder Cent bei diesem Projekt helfen. Allerdings kann es leider nur ein Textilgeschenk geben (T-Shirt oder Beutel) wenn eure Unterstützung nich über 1.000 € hinaus geht. In dem Fall sollt ihr dennoch nicht leer ausgehen. Ich werde euch die Möglichkeit geben über euer Lieblingstextilstück abzustimmen und andere Belohnungen für euch vorbereiten! Außerdem wird die CD auf jeden Fall erhältlich sein! Ein flexibles Förderungsziel hat allerdings auch den Vorteil, dass wir deutlich mehr als 5.000 € zusammenbringen können. Wenn sich eure gesamte Unterstützung auf mindestens 5.000 € beläuft, dann wird jeder der 70€ oder mehr gespendet hat, eine Vinyl/Schallplatte gratis dazubekommen!  

 
 
How can I help without donating?/Wie kann ich auch ohne Spende helfen?
 
English ➡ I've experienced times of my own where I didn't have an extra cent, I know that you could be in this situation, as well. If you still would like to support me, here are some extremely helpful and valuable ways to do so:

Send my project to friends, colleagues and family 
Post my link in social media like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram -> Click on the Facebook, Google Plus or Twitter icons on top of this page to share through your social media networks
Let me know if any newspaper or blog comes to mind which could be interested in writing about my campaign!
Pray for me 

Deutsch ➡ Ich weiß aus eigener Erfahrungen, dass es Zeiten geben kann, in denen man finanziell keinen Cent entbehren kann. Falls ihr mich dennoch unterstützen wollt, könnt ihr dies durch eure wertvolle Hilfe realisieren:

Sendet mein Projekt an eure Freunde, Bekannte und Familie
Posted den Link in Social Media wie Facebook, Instagram, Twitter etc.-> dafür könnt ihr auf die Social Media Icons oben auf der Seite klicken.

<h3>Merry Christmas!</h3>
<p>First, I want to say that I greatly appreciate you taking the time to visit this page and to consider making a contribution to my campaign.  Thank you!  My name is Abigail Winzer and I am a Faith-filled soprano vocalist who just released a debut album ""Rejoice"", which to my absolute delight (and relief) has gotten phenomenal reviews.  This self-funded album was a big risk both artistically and financially.  I was truly blessed with a family that believes in me and a few absolutely amazing artists who were willing to contribute musically to the album.  What started out as a day dream last summer on the long drive home from Nashville now has become a reality and I have the Christmas album I dreamed of ready to go out to the world...and that is where this ""DYI"" musician needs your help!</p>
<p>Here are just a few comments from the critics: </p>
<ul>
<li>""Rejoice over Abigail Winzer’s Rejoice."" ~ Ralph Greco, ShortandSweetNYC</li>
<li>""Winzer is inviting listeners to meditate about a spiritually significant time of the year,""                  ~ SAHAR, Blogcritics.org</li>
<li>""At 16 years old, Abigail has a beautifully clear soprano that is suited for the timeless repertoire of carols."" ~ Anya Wassenberg, Art &amp; Culture Maven</li>
<li>""Rejoice is a far cry from the holiday playlists that are usually blaring out of the loud speaker at your local shopping mall. There's a majestic quality to these renditions that's usually absent from the mass produced, commercial fare."" ~  Evan Morgan, Blastingnews.com</li>
<li>""Abigail Winzer Gives Us Something to ‘Rejoice’ About With Christmas Album"" ~ Lisa Hafey, ESSENTIALLYPOP.COM</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read more reviews on my facebook page!</p>
<p>Christmas is my favorite time of the year.  I love it!  I also know that for many people, it is a hectic and even sad time of the year.  With that in mind, I approached ""Rejoice"" as an effort to help people unwind and relax during the holidays by re-imagining Christmas classics with serene arrangements and old world instruments such as the duduk and Irish harp; peaceful music that produces feelings of love &amp; joy.  I also wanted to create an album of songs that seems to transport the listener back in time to Bethlehem.  The serene arrangements and old world instruments give the familiar classics a new texture that allows listeners to reflect spiritually and re-connect with the meaning of Christmas.  I wanted the songs to elevate the feeling of hope throughout the season and to provide comfort to those who may be suffering during the holidays.  Many people have already told me about how Rejoice has given them peace which has humbled me as well as touched my heart. </p>
<p>I want to be able to reach more people that will be positively impacted by Rejoice and that is where I need the generous help of the supporters here on Indiegogo.  With your support, I will spread the joy of Christmas through my music and help people around the world experience peace during the holiday season.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Before we start, Powerline Sneakers wanna send serious love and thanx to the extraordinary mob of live music enthusiasts who have made our world a way better place.  We’ve had a good run and it’s mostly down to the people who come out and support what we do.</p>
<p>We never imagined that ‘…disasterpiece ‘ would be received as enthusiastically as it has been.  We put our collective heart and soul into that record and it struck a chord with Aussie music fans here and O/S…….</p>
<p>The release of the vinyl edition has been passionately received. You guys are as excited at what we offer as ever.  Muchos gracious amigos! </p>
<p>PLS decided to take a break from playing in February but it hasn’t been time wasted.   In fact, we have a new album to record.  As I write, we are sorting through new songs deciding what to include on the new album and what stays on the bench.</p>
<p>We now want to offer independent rock n roll fans the opportunity to be a part of the monumental follow up to “…disasterpiece”.   And it’s easy to promise right here. </p>
<p>This second album will eclipse “…disasterpiece” in its power and beauty, its euphonious élan.  </p>
<p>But, as Hamlet would have it, here’s the rub.  PLS are now, here, bringing it to you, the real people.  To record this album, we need financial support from the people who actually create the scene. </p>

<h3>How I Escaped From Prison...</h3>
<p>My name is Anthony Tripp, I am an alt-acoustic singer/songwriter with a folk-rock kind of vibe. I learned to play guitar in high school and earned my chops while homeless, playing on the street for spare change. I was blindly reeking havoc in my life; I couldn't hold a job, keep good friends, or even stay sober. I saw no off ramps, no turnarounds, and I probably didn't even want to. It was all or nothing. Ride it until the wheels fall off, count the bodies later and before life got easier, it got much much harder.</p>
<p>In 2004, at the height of my chaos, I started a fight that put me in prison. It was wrong, and I was very guilty. But that's exactly what I needed. I learned how to write from the heart while I was locked up. I saw the reckless, selfish life I was leading and where it was going to take me. I saw the injustices and racism in prison, the prey/predator mentality and the hopelessness. I knew I had a choice to make. I could be a victim of life or a co-writer of it, and if I didn't like what I saw, it was up to me to paint a brighter picture. </p>
<p>When I was released from prison over a decade ago I vowed to never go back. To do all that I could to lead by example so others didn't have to follow the same path. That's exactly what I've been trying to do ever since. My songs are a glimpse into the conscious decisions I've made to switch up my perspective, hone my intention, reveal my shadows, and allow for healing in my life and in the lives of others as well.  And now, years later and lessons learned, I'm ready to share my story with the world. Wanna help?</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Like I mentioned up top, the tracking for the album is done and the tour is booked. </p>
<p>Whats left? Let me break it down:</p>
<p>Mixing and Mastering ($1,000)</p>
<p>Marketing ($500)</p>
<p>Pressing CDs ($500)</p>
<p>Live sound equipment for the tour ($800)</p>
<p>Printing posters, t-shirts and other exclusive merch for campaign backers ($500)</p>
<p>TOTAL - $3,300</p>
<p>If I've learned anything from my past is that gratitude goes a long way. So in exchange for your patronage, I want to give you something in return. Depending on your level of donation, you will receive some awesome rewards like pre-release access, patron-only swag, additional tracks, and even a private performance for you and all your friends and family! Check out the column to the right for all the specifics.</p>
<p>IF I don't meet my goal? That's okay too! The funding I do raise will be prioritized into getting you the rewards I've promised, the live sound equipment, and finishing the mixing and mastering of the album. The physical release date will get pushed back and I'll rely on some grassroots marketing and word-of-mouth to promote the digital release until I raise the money on my own. Life has also taught me adaptability and to have flexible expectations (or none at all...)!  Honestly, I will consider myself blessed with any amount raised. It all goes to further the music!</p>

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Is This So Important To Me?</h3>
<p>When I was a kid, I remember that my parents did the best they knew how to raise my brother an I. I grew up in a good home with wholesome values; don't lie, don't steal, be nice. Sometime in my teens, I started asking ""Or what?"" to the principles that my mom and dad tried to instill in me. I wanted to push back, test boundaries, break the rules. I suppose that's normal for most kids, but for my parents, I feel it was like watching this beautiful soul that they had raised start to turn and spit poison at them for no reason! Looking back, it breaks my heart to step into their shoes and experience life through their eyes.  </p>
<p>Not a unique story, nor the worst out there, I know. What I'm getting at is that I gave myself permission to accept my natural ability as an empath that I suppressed for so many years. Now that it's in the driver's seat, I want to shine brightly for others. I want to give hope to the parents who are watching their children make all the wrong decisions and show the youth that might want to go the way I did that they don't have to stay that course. I want to shake you out of the negative rut you may find yourself in and demonstrate that you can choose to be better, make the positive change in your life, learn to let go of what you can't change and see the lessons that the universe has to offer you for what they are.</p>
<p>I'll continue to write and perform regardless of how this campaign shakes out. It's in my bones. I have to. It's my calling. I've been told by strangers at gigs I've played that this song or that song touched them so deeply, they thanked me for being such an inspiration. This isn't some delusion of grandeur. I don't think I'm gods gift to humanity. I just have a story to tell, and I know there are people out there that are ready to hear it from an open place and be able to apply it to their lives. I've told this story many times to many people. Now, with this campaign, I want to tell it louder, to more people and just keep shining brightly so others can see in the dark too.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Can't Donate? That's totally fine!</h3>
<p>I get it. I work full time and still, most of all my paychecks go to rent and bills and it's a stretch for me to buy new guitar strings! I mean, I'm on here asking the world for money! If donating money to this cause isn't in the cards for you, then choose to share this in your circles, give me a shout-out on your favorite social media platform, or mention this in your blog. IndieGoGo has some really great share tools! Check them out! It all helps and I will continue to give thanks and be grateful for every little bit anyone wants to bring to the table.

<p>Hey Humans, its Kodi.</p> <p>    Thank you for taking the time to check out my album’s page. If you don’t know me, I’m an eclectic Native American artist based in Brooklyn, New York. “Midnight Ramblings” the album is beyond important to me, and if you’re here you’re destined to be part of its journey. This easy listening folk album tells my life’s story through lore and song, starting with my roots in Nebraska. If the 7 track EP wasn’t enough, “Midnight Ramblings” is part 1 of a 2 part album series. Music and vocalists from my original immersive musical, “Chrysalis”, will also make an appearance on the album. I am so thankful to say that “Chrysalis” was entirely funded by group funding and concerts. After receiving such love and productive feedback, I will not put up my work any other way. To have your fans and supporters back you up is an indescribable feeling for an artist, and that’s why I believe in the power of the people to get this album on its feet. For everyone who has been here with me during this, the music belongs to all of us, and I can’t wait to see how far it takes us all;)!</p> <p>    I am putting up this group funding page to expand my album beyond my own personal means. This is why I left the campaign open to $750/any amount raised. I don’t need any specific amount, I want to take this album as far as my supporters want it to go! I believe wholeheartedly in my sound and my composition, but I want the album to be part of something bigger than myself. I believe in its potential, and I hope you will too. Show your love and support any way you are able. Sharing and discussing is just as valuable as money. If you decide to support monetarily check out our perks so we can give back to you! Your contribution will go directly towards equipment, venues, artist stipends, copywriting, mastering, touring, album reach, marketing, and more. Every penny counts! Readers and listeners, thank you again for your time, and I hope you stayed tuned for this process.</p> <p>With love,</p>

<h3>A Little Bit About Me!</h3>
<p>I'm a singer-songwriter both and raised in Baltimore, trained at The Peabody Institute, the Walden School for Young Composers, and Oberlin Conservatory, in piano, composition, and theory. I've been studying the art of songwriting, and was on the board of the Baltimore Songwriter's Association for over a decade.</p>
<p>I've been raising two sons for the last two decades, and now that they've grown up, I'd like to branch out, intensify my efforts to nurture my songwriting career, and bring my music to a wider audience. </p>
<p>I created this EP as a tool to help get my music in front of more eyes within the industry. I funded it thus far by setting all cash earnings from my performances aside (actually, in a shoe box, lined up like Monopoly money).  Now my release date is almost here! The tracks are recorded, and I'm at the final stage of mastering, and printing. This is the home stretch, so I'm comfortable offering my EP to you in a preorder status! The launch parties will be around my birthday weekend, the second weekof November. </p>
<p>This will help with the final touches (mixing and mastering), the CD artwork, and the printing. (I am of the generation that still  adores physical CDs).</p>
</div><div>
<h3>My Goals, and What I'm Offering to YOU!</h3>
<p>I've estimated about $1000.00 left to complete the mastering, CD artwork and physical duplication.  </p>
<p>I'm offering private stock of songs that have never been released, but have been recorded solo, I think you'll enjoy them, and I'm happy to share them to help further along this EP!</p>
<p>I'm opening up opportunities for you to learn from some of the skills I've developed along the way, including songwriting and theory. I can help you add more color to your sound. I'm also available for songwriting critique/feedback sessions.</p>
<p>I'd also love to perform for your special event, company party, or family gathering.  I have a wide repetoire of both originals and covers from a variety of styles, and eras, featuring a very roots oriented sound.</p>
<p>Delicate is a 5-song EP that will be available with a download card, or a physical EP. The additional solo songs will be sent via email as MP3s. Your EP will be available to ship (will include nominal shipping fees), or for a hand-off at any of my upcoming EP release parties. </p>
<p>Preorder of Delicate: $8.00 </p>
<p>Preorder of Delicate  plus 5 extra solo songs $15.00 </p>
<p>A one- hour class on songwriting, creativity, or theory, plus the EP: $65.00 (scheduling based upon availabliity)</p>
<p>A 1-2 hour private concert for a family or company gathering, plus the EP: $185.00</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>HannaH’s Field provides a melodical embrace in a world growing ever too distant. With a blend of dimension shifting intentions and positive vibrations they brew a musical medicine that can be described as “Modern Hippie Rasta Folk” or in other words, Magic. The release of their new album “Crystal Vision” is truly an offering for the ages. Within the perils of our current affairs, the world is in dire need of healing. This collection of elixirs promotes a message,  a proclamation of light and love for uncertain times. HannaH’s Field is humbly asking for those that are able to come together in support, and contribute towards the production, release, and promotion of this much needed vision. You can of course Pre Order “Crystal Vision” but there are multiple multicolored ways to support, so be sure to check out the awesome Perks below!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Reaching  the campaign goal will ensure a successful accomplishment of a few hurdles of the Release. Contributions will go to fund the duplication,  Packaging and Presentation of ""Crystal Vision"". Included will be a unique addition of a Fairy Star Crystal Grid and gem stones, aligned with the energy of each song selected by crystal experts.  By supporting you are also helping to obtain a Publicity Campaign that will allow HannaH's Field to spread their message via Nationwide Radio, Podcasts, Blogs and other media outlets!   The last media campaign yielded successful airplay on radio stations nationwide, regular rotation on The Joint-Sirius Satellite Radio and helped the album reach #11 on the Relix/Jam Band charts. </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p>“Crystal Vision” is a collaboration of alchemy and melody. Infusing their unique Fairy Folk and Reggae riffs, HannaH’s Field creates an uplifting vibration that can be felt inward and outward. With an emphasis on Earthy Elements, and a re connection to our roots, this album provides a tangible practice for those who seek to raise their frequency. Heartfelt and heart centered this album is a hug for your ears.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div><h3>A Walk Through HannaH's Field</h3></div><div>
<p>Founded in 2000, HannaH’s Field is a breath of fresh air in the New England music community. They have brought love and hug vibrations to festivals such as The 50th Anniversary of Woodstock, Unifier, and Project Earth. Originating as a solo project, Hannah released “Inside A Song” in 2004. Later as fate devised, she met her life partner Bliss, while attending the Hartford Conservatory of Music. Bliss auditioned to be HannaH’s drummer and they never looked back. They created songs and stories for 10 years, until the addition of guitarist Aidan Moore and bassist John Pitblado, and thus co creating the full and lively sound you hear today. </p> <p>HannaH, founding member of HannaH’s Field, is the fearless leader of her Band of Revolutionary Soldiers. Sending serenity through sound waves she has been nominated best female vocalist in The Hartford Advocate for multiple years. After 6 Studio Albums to date, she finds solace in teaching Spiritual Life Skills, music and voice, to those who seek to expand. HannaH is a shining example of what a great Female Role Model looks like for young women to look up to everywhere. </p> <p>Chef Bliss lovingly embraces being the Pulse of HannaH’s Field. Drummer and accomplished  holistic chef, he never fails to bring a smile to audiences nationwide. As a master carpenter he prides himself in the tour bus(""Trinity-Ites"") that he built out for the band, which has been their chariot for several cross country musical journeys. </p> <p>John Pitblado “ Jah Pitts” :  HannaH’s Field official Astronaut, he brings the funk with each Bass line.  Also contributing to HannaH’s Field side project, High Tide: A Tribute to Bob Marley,  Jah Pitts brings a fusion of reggae bass riffs and jam rock to the band that transcend dimensions. He began playing in the early 90s with Uncle Juice who supported bands such as  The Samples and Ziggy Marley. </p> <p>Aidan Moore “Little Lion”: An exemplary guitarist, Little Lion steals the stage with each solo. He is influenced heavily by the Grateful Dead, and his flowing style reflects that. He prides himself in being in a band of individuals out to make a change, and backs each one up with his attention to musical intention every time. His older brother sold some of his own DJ equipment to buy Aidans first guitar when he was 10 years old, and he hasn't stopped playing since! </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We spent the end of 2019 hunkered down in a wood paneled recording studio filled with vintage guitars, high end audio gear, and a beautiful grand piano.  Our goal was to capture eleven of our best songs with one of the best recording engineers in southern Maine - Todd Hutchisen of Acadia Recording.  Spending those days in his audio playland was a dream, and we're incredibly proud of what we've made together.<br/><br/>We have already finished one song as a single so you can hear the quality of the recordings.  It's our song, ""Sleepless Night"".  Check it out in the video above and on Spotify!  </p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>

<li>We have an awesome team lined up to take those rough recordings the rest of the way: a mix engineer (Todd Hutchisen) and mastering engineer (Pat Keane) who are ready and eager to get the songs polished up and ready to release.</li>
<li>It will take about $3,000 to mix and master the recordings and get them distributed. The faster we can raise that money, the faster we can release the album for YOU to enjoy!</li>

I have been carving sonic soundscapes for the past 18 years, since the early age of 14 while building a still nascent, young and struggling experimental music underground in my city Addis Ababa. Ethiopiyawi electronic (sometimes spelled Ethiopiawi Electronic) is a genre that uses Electronic Music tools, and Music Technology to make music that is very deeply rooted in the music from all over Ethiopia and Africa. One of the main pillars of the genre is Azmari Culture and traditional music from all over Ethiopia, music that is the pillar of almost all the music we listen to today.</p>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<p><strong>WEL double EP</strong> consists 10 tracks and comes with 2 music videos, and an array of artworks. WEL means togetherness and it is inspired by Laureate Poet Tsegaye Gebremedhin’s poem recordings. Wel calls for a loving joyful global revolution and asks for people to come forth and take charge of their destiny like we are trying to do as change only comes through revolution, and by demanding for it, lovingly and intentionally.</p>
<h3>Our Journey So Far</h3>
<p>This crowdfunding is made after we have for years worked in creating our own independent, artist owned, event and representation company WAG, with the goal to build it up to a record label, and build our own creative space, studio space, called GODJO and we were on the right track before the COVID-19 pandemic hit and put our projects in jeopardy. We have taken the initiative to take charge of our own fate as African independent artists and specially experimental and traditional artists don’t have the structural support to keep their professional and artistic careers going.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The amount €35,000 will go to fund the double EP, have it resonate and sustain myself and my team’s vision and survival. We have created a number of cool perks that you can choose from when you decide to back this EP. Contribute what you can!</p>
<p>If we don't reach the entire goal, it will take a bit longer to put out the double EP, as well as we will have to simplify the scope of the project.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will not just be helping us, it will be helping the creatives and creative professionals that collaborate with us, that we intend to hire, it will sustain the entire ecosystem around our vision as we haven't gotten here alone, many creatives have supported us, and dedicated their time and talents. The other thing is we will not be renting anything, we will be purchasing every material needed to make this project and we will be using our own space, in order to use it for other projects, so you will not only help us make music but also be more independent and self reliant in our vision. You will help us lay the first bricks for our creative space building project called Godjo. </p>
<p>I hope the impact of this EPs will be to bring people together around common goals of intention and purpose, and the people who will come in contact with the EP and who will participate in making this project a reality will push along with us not only the imperative necessity but also the practicality of a fairer, more caring, united world, long after this project is concluded.</p>

<h3>&lt;Short Summary&gt;</h3>
<p>One Way to Live is an independent Metal band who has brought a fierce contending sound to alternative Metal with professional presence and grit. </p>
<p>One Way to Live is recording their upcoming record with Dusty Boles (ex. Make Me Famous, Rose Funeral), and have since diligently produced content slated to capture the market as they prepare to hit the road. Now, the band has encountered high stakes to have their voices heard and make their vision a reality, and needs your help to bring that vision to you on stage.</p>
<p>The story of One Way to Live : </p>
<p><i>One Way to Live projects the life of the outsider to an ear long awaiting change. From their formation in winter of 2015, Denver band One Way to Live has leaped beyond expectations of the Metalcore scene with a unique presence, having shared the stage with acts ranging from Kingdom of Giants, Earth Groans, Once Human, Outline In Color, Hallow Point, and many more.</i></p>
<p><i>One Way to Live derives the notion that nothing is ever as it seems, and we've only one way to approach hardship: with integrity, strength, and an open mind. We chose this name as a close acronym, ""OWL"", with the idea that great minds live from a distance and crave to know what lies behind the surface. Quite often those who are different make a difference; those who stand out aren't often accepted, those who stand up aren't at first acknowledged, and those who think outside of the box aren't always understood.</i></p>
<p><i>Society had instilled norms and standards years ago that not everyone can adhere to, and One Way to Live shares the message that those chains must be broken. Outsiders are those who refuse to obey the status quo, those who are meant to make a change. </i></p>
<p><i>We are Outsiders. This is One Way to Live. </i></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>&lt;What We Need &amp; What You Get&gt;</h3>
<p>Making a record is not cheap in the slightest, and it's only the beginning of the struggle bands face in producing art. From music videos, promo shots, graphic design, recording, mixing, mastering, gear repair, band member repair, and many more, being in a band can get pretty expensive. These costs can run into the tens of thousands quite quickly. All expenses aside, however, all we are focusing upon is getting our work in your hands, as we are elated to share it with you.</p>
<p>The $10,000 we are campaigning for is to help fund the creation and distribution of our EP. Here is a quick breakdown to show you where your money is going:</p>
<p>Recording, mixing and mastering - $6,000</p>
<p>Cost of goods for perks - $3,000</p>
<p>IndieGoGo and Credit Card Fees $1,000</p>
<p>In exchange for your support, we are offering exclusive items, some of which are only available through this campaign and are limited quantity. So....when they're gone, they're <i>gone</i>. </p>
<p>We're working our hardest to ensure desired products can get into your hands, so please don't hesitate to reach out to us if there are any perks you'd like to see adjusted or added. </p>

<p><i><strong>Standard Broadcast</strong></i> is a Pittsburgh, PA based Indie Rock four-piece. Nathan Jay (piano and vocals), Leland Shaw (cello), Holly Fromlak (guitar and vocals) and Jeff Skalyo(drums).<br/><br/>Formed in 2014, Nathan and Leland set out to create a more dynamic, catchy feel, without the traditional guitar/bass ensemble.<br/><br/>After six months of songwriting, the guys went on to add Holly's almost hip-hop driven beats.

<p>Looking to expand their sound, they brought on Jeff as the new drummer in the summer of 2015 and Holly transitioned over to lead guitar, her preferred instrument.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<ul><li>We will be recording both at ""Fire K Studios"" and with Jake Hanner of the band - <u><i><strong>Donora</strong></i></u> (Rostrum Records).

While recording with Jake Hanner, we will be able to capture the lead/harmony vocals and the rocking guitar. Along with recording, Jake will be helping us produce this album.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Mixing and Mastering</strong></p>
<ul><li>Along with recording comes mixing and mastering. Jake Hanner will be mastering our tracks and is a key element for our final product. </li></ul>
<p><strong>Promotional Materials</strong> </p>
<ul><li>After we have recorded, we will be sending out our produced CD and setting dates for our tour. We will need money to purchase our merchandise which we hope to include shirts and a vinyl version of our album.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Venue Fees</strong></p>
<ul><li>Finally to promote our CD release we will be playing at Club Cafe. This fee will include the venue and the soundboard operator. This will also help us pay for the VIP Passes for our fans. The VIP will include: reserved table, first round of drinks, first appetizer, and a way down to our concert via a credit for Uber/Lyft. </li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Be The First</h3>
<p>Everyone wants to be the first to know new music. <i><strong>Standard Broadcast</strong></i>  is a unique blend of music that is on the cutting edge. We have played several concerts, including The Layer Cake Festival in Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Pride Fest, Pittsburgh's first ""Indie-Rockfest"", been featured on Pittsburgh's 105.9 the X as well as independent radio station 91.3(WYEP) ""The 9:13 Buzz"".  We also have been written up in Pittsburgh's City Paper about our EP ""It All Comes Back to You"" (<a href=""http://www.standardbroadcastband.com/press.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.standardbroadcastband.com/press.html</a>).</p>
<p><i><strong>Standard Broadcast</strong></i> has the musical experience and are ready to make the next step with this album. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Musician Problem</h3>
<p>Everyone in this band understands that music is not a day job. The band members of  <i><strong>Standard Broadcast</strong></i>  have careers, families and lives. We have made music part of our lives and worked with our families and jobs to grow. We hope to make music our income replacement and this is a chance to make that happen.</p>

After we have recorded, we will be sending out our produced CD and setting dates for our tour. We will need money to purchase our merchandise which we hope to include shirts and a vinyl version of our album.
Venue Fees
Finally to promote our CD release we will be playing at Club Cafe. This fee will include the venue and the soundboard operator. This will also help us pay for the VIP Passes for our fans. The VIP will include: reserved table, first round of drinks, first appetizer, and a way down to our concert via a credit for Uber/Lyft. 

 
Be The First
Everyone wants to be the first to know new music. Standard Broadcast  is a unique blend of music that is on the cutting edge. We have played several concerts, including The Layer Cake Festival in Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Pride Fest, Pittsburgh's first ""Indie-Rockfest"", been featured on Pittsburgh's 105.9 the X as well as independent radio station 91.3(WYEP) ""The 9:13 Buzz"".  We also have been written up in Pittsburgh's City Paper about our EP ""It All Comes Back to You"" (http://www.standardbroadcastband.com/press.html).
Standard Broadcast has the musical experience and are ready to make the next step with this album. 
 

The Musician Problem
Everyone in this band understands that music is not a day job. The band members of  Standard Broadcast  have careers, families and lives. We have made music part of our lives and worked with our families and jobs to grow. We hope to make music our income replacement and this is a chance to make that happen.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p>At the age of 5 years old, I found myself mimicking my mom’s voice as she would sing through the house. The freedom that I felt when I would sing could not be compared to anything else. The love to sing grew into something more than what I could have imagined. Little did I know that singing would be the lighthouse that would keep me searching deeper to know Jesus.</p>
<p>    I went through a time of depression, wanting to give up on life in general, suddenly a single mom and having to make some difficult choices that were not in the original plan of my life. I felt like I had a cloud following me everywhere. There were moments when the breath of God seemed so far away. My voice seemed to have been quickly fading along with the rest of my life. The enemy could not wait to silence me. I began to shrink back, and I was no longer confident in the promises of what God had originally spoken to me about who I was. Time went on and, with much plowing, God brought me to a place of sweet surrender where He began to heal me in places deeper than I wanted to go. In this process, I began to reclaim my voice and found myself singing songs of deliverance over myself.  I had those flashback moments of when I was 5 years old with my mom, but I was no longer mimicking her. I began mimicking the word of God over my life. <br/>    Through every season, I realized NO ONE could steal my song. Through every trial, any stage of grieving, heartache, or highs there is a song that will rise from your heart! You are unable to contain it. It springs up and out and overflows into others. It is the song of hope and joy that is co-written with Jesus in the garden, a safe space with you and Him. These songs give us oxygen to take the next breath and create a greater awareness of God. This has allowed me to receive an unfiltered love from Jesus! Yes it is a process, but oh the joy that comes from it!</p>
<p>    God’s faithfulness of His spoken word is real, and it is hard not to express it in some way. So, with all vulnerability and openness, I invite you to join me in telling my life story through songs of joy, sorrow, pain, and celebration. You can engage in this project by.  Expressing Life Through Song is like honey that heals the soul.</p>

<h3>To New York, with love...</h3>
<p>is a project that has unknowingly been in the works for years. It has always been in my 5 year plan to move to New York after graduating from Northwestern. And now that it's finally happened? Well... you might say that I'm falling in love ;)</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>. . . .</strong></p>
<p>While I didn't realize it at first, this project is truly a product of the last 10 years of my life. When I graduated in June 2017, I looked back on everything I learned during school - about theatre, about composition, about myself... and it was shocking to think about how much I really grew (I mean, isn't that what college is for?) But now, 6 months out of school, I realize that these first few months as an ""adult"" have taught me <i>so much more</i>. </p>
<p>My first summer in New York was amazing, but terrifying. Not because of the new city or the new life - but with nothing concrete in my iCal, with no structure of classes, tests, etc. I didn't know what to do with myself. I spent a lot of time thinking: What do I want to do with my life? What makes me happy? What makes me <i>the happiest</i>?</p>
<p>So. With my whole life story swirling through my head and all the future possibilities tumbling on top of that. I did the only thing that works for me.</p>
<p>I wrote it all down...</p>
<h3>SO, back to basics - who am I?</h3>
<p>My name is Charlotte Morris and I'm a 23-year-old singer/songwriter originally from outside of Philadelphia. Music has always been a huge part of my life. I don't remember a time when I wasn't singing along to the radio, acting out musical theatre or playing some instrument or another. Growing up, it was always the Beatles, Peter, Paul and Mary, or Simon &amp; Garfunkel playing in the car. After school, it was violin and voice lessons. On the weekends, it was a symphony concert or a show downtown. I am so lucky to have my amazing parents, because, with their influence (and DNA!), music became the most important thing in my life.<br/><br/>Writing music never really crossed my mind until, at 13, I learned that a family friend wrote songs in her journal. I thought it was the COOLEST thing, and it reminded me of girls in the angsty Disney teen movies (which made it even cooler). So I decided that I would try and write something. And WOW, it stuck. </p>
<p>Since that glorious summer of musical discovery, I have had a range of experiences in the music industry. I had an amazing time releasing my first single on iTunes, ""<a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/ke/album/stay-strong/915578717?i=915578777"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Stay Strong</a>"" in 2010. I had a less than perfect<i> </i>experience with a, shall we say, ""sketchy"" producer in LA, who, with all of his flaws, made me realize how much I actually wanted to do this for a living. The same year, I performed at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYKqdhuEdk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The American Idol Experience</a>, where I felt my first rush of performing for thousands of people. And I found my musical voice as I tried to balance writing for theatre and writing pop music throughout college. (Want examples? Check out my <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/user-71272898"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Soundcloud</a>!)</p>
<p><strong>So here we are.</strong> 10 years later. Hundreds of less-than-perfect songs in the trash. Just enough great ones to remind me that I can actually do this. And I am ready to make this dream come true. </p>
<h3>The Details</h3>
<p><i>To New York, with love </i>is a three part project. <strong>I will release an EP</strong>, entitled <i>To New York, with love, </i>with 4 completely new songs. The EP will be released on Spotify and Soundcloud for free streaming. It will also be available for download on iTunes and Amazon Music. <strong>I will also film my first music video</strong> for one of the EP tracks. <strong>And finally, I will perform a solo concert in NYC at <a href=""https://54below.secure.force.com/ticket/#details_a0S1Y00000K5oQ8UAJ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Feinstein's/54 Below</a></strong> with all original pop music (with a few musical theatre tracks thrown in for fun). We will film and record during the first three months of 2018 and then enter post-production in April. The concert will take place on <strong>September 15th, 11:30PM </strong>- tickets can be purchased <a href=""https://54below.secure.force.com/ticket/#sections_a0F1Y00000jkhCXUAY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HERE</a>.</p>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<p>I feel SO lucky to have two fellow Northwestern alums on board to help me with this project. </p>
<p><strong>Conor Keelan </strong>(NU, '16) will record and mix my EP as well as head up the band for the concert. Conor and I were in the same a cappella group in college (<a href=""http://xfactorsnu.wixsite.com/nuxfactors"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The X-Factors</a>) and performed side by side in a number of theatrical productions. Most recently, Conor helped produce my Fall 2017 single, <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/user-71272898/clocks"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Clocks</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Eddie Sánchez </strong>(NU, '17) will direct my music video, as well as co-create the artistic concept with me. Eddie is a man of all talents and not only directs, but acts and writes as well. Most recently, Eddie was out in LA finishing up production for <i>Insignificant Other.</i></p>
<h3>The Breakdown</h3>
<p><strong>The EP </strong>- $1000<br/>Thank goodness for modern technology, because a lot of the recording can be done in Conor's apartment with equipment owned by Conor or myself. We are looking to raise $1000 to go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>instrument tracks (for any instruments that we can't play live)</li>
<li>specific equipment rental (<i>very </i>high tech mics) </li>
<li>post-production mixing software</li>
<li>a small batch of physical CDs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Music Video </strong>- $2500<br/>As Eddie told me, ""The world is my oyster"" when it comes to budgeting for a music video. If you film solely on your iPhoneX, you can spend almost nothing. You can also spend hundreds of thousands of dollars. We are looking to raise $2500 to pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>camera equipment (because none of us own the iPhoneX)</li>
<li>filming personnel (videographer, grip, lighting)</li>
<li>actors</li>
<li>post-production software (e.g. SFX)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Concert </strong>- $2000<br/>As a new artist in New York, it can be hard to get a hold of spaces without paying a hefty rental fee (among other things). So, we are looking to raise $2000 to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>the space</li>
<li>additional musicians for the band (bassist and drummer)</li>
<li>filming of the concert</li>
<li>rehearsal space</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous </strong>- $500<br/>We added an additional $500 to the goal to cover all the things that people forget until they need to be dealt with - such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social Media Advertising (to promote everything!)</li>
<li>Paper goods (programs, set lists, etc.)</li>
<li>All the other things that I can't think of now but are sure to come up!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But what if the fundraising campaign is WILDLY successful and I raise <i>more </i>than the goal of $6,000?!</strong></p>
<p>Any additional funds raised will EITHER 1) go towards making an even higher quality music video or 2) go towards my next project, coming Winter 2018 (hint hint: It has to do with Christmas!)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where YOU Come In</h3>
<p>My music means everything to me, but I can't do it all without your help. I have never done a solo project this large before, so it's pretty scary, but VERY exciting. Have no fear though! While this may be my first solo fundraising campaign, I have a ton of experience fundraising and producing for musical theatre. While at Northwestern, I co-produced <a href=""http://james-keane-q5q8.squarespace.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Waa-Mu Show</a> (for which I also wrote music &amp; performed). In a little less than a year, we raised over $30,000 and managed a budget of over $100,000. Additionally, we raised over $2,000 for Lurie Children's Hospital throughout the run of our show to give back to the community. Hopefully this instills confidence in you that I <i>will </i>go above and beyond to get you a product that your support deserves. I have such an amazing team of people behind me and with your help, we can make the music happen!</p>
<p>You may be asking yourself, <strong>what does this project do for me? </strong>WELL let me tell you.</p>
<p>It is my belief that the arts are vital to our society. Even with all of the crazy things happening in America today, the arts bring optimism, determination and community to the forefront. These 3 values are what I hope to bring forth in <i>To New York, with love.</i> I hope that this project will remind you to find the good. I hope my words will encourage you to keep fighting for your beliefs. And most of all, I just hope that my music will make you smile!</p>
<p>Additionally, I will send some sweet, sweet perks your way. As a new artist, I don't have any t-shirts or water bottles with my face to ship you, but hopefully some ~~insider knowledge~~ and star opportunities will pique your interest!</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with anything, there are risks. I might not reach my fundraising goal. A musician might have to duck out last minute. Life might throw me the most random of curve balls! But no matter what, I am a woman of my word. When I commit to something, it gets done. So even if we don't hit $6,000, you will see new material from me later this year. Even if we need to find a musician last minute - welp! good thing I went to school with a million of them. I'm a problem solver and I'm ambitious. So when you put those two things together in correlation with my<i> </i>dream - there is nothing I can't accomplish!</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>As you all know, fans and supporters in the music industry are EVERYTHING. Truly, I would be nothing without the people listening to my music! I would be nothing without you! Sooo...</p>

<p><strong>Who am I?</strong></p>
<p>Hi there! My name is Cassondra. I am a Brooklyn-based singer-songwriter who needs your help.</p>
<p>At a young age I began singing with a church group, eventually moving on to sing with local rock bands in Buffalo, NY. When I made the leap to New York City at the age of 19, I played music in the subway and shook down open-mics in Brooklyn. This helped me connect with fellow musicians, with whom I now collaborate in my various bands. I regularly perform at popular music venues such as Rockwood Music Hall, Pianos, Knitting Factory, The Way Station, Pete’s Candy Store, and Sidewalk Cafe.</p>
<p>My punk/folk blend combines my unique, bluesy lyricism with raw, domineering energy. I draw inspiration from personal relationships, singing about the struggles of falling in and out of love.</p>
<p>This EP is something I’ve been wanting to do for a very long time. I have worked on these songs for 7 years and want to finally share them with the world. These songs are very important to me and have helped me get through some of my darkest times. I hope they do the same for those who donate to my project.</p>
<p>Contributing to this will help me achieve my dream of having an album to call my own. I hope to put out something that not only speaks to me, but strikes something in the hearts of strangers to help them overcome their struggles.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What I need &amp; what you get out of it!</strong></p>
<p>I need to raise $5,000 to complete this album. That money goes toward paying musicians, recording engineer, producers, travel costs, mastering, merch, and taking time off of work to complete it.</p>
<p>There are perks for donating as well!!</p>
<p>$5- Facebook/Instagram shoutout</p>
<p>$15- Facebook/Instagram shoutout &amp; free download of the album</p>
<p>$50- Facebook/Instagram shoutout, free download of the album &amp; a T-Shirt</p>

<p>$500- Facebook/Instagram shoutout, free download of the album, T-Shirt, handwritten thank you letter, &amp; a personal video of me playing whatever song you choose (original or a cover)!</p>
<p>$1,000- Facebook/Instagram shoutout, free download of the album, T-Shirt, handwritten thank you letter, a personal video of me playing whatever song you choose (original or a cover) &amp; a living room show for you and your friends! I will come to you!</p>
<p>If I don’t reach my entire goal, the money will directly be given to the musicians and engineers for the album, and the rest I will attempt to pay out of pocket.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why should I?</strong></p>
<p>Hey. I understand. We all have bills to pay and donating may seem like a stretch. But your contribution will go a long way. I have been singing my entire life and I need to get my music out to the world. I have played with multiple bands, sang on numerous tracks, performed on many stages, but never recorded my own music. This is my passion, and your help will make this come alive. Help me on my journey to become a full-time artist.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The world we live in is complicated, extremely fast-paced, and not without its share of catastrophes and suffering. <strong>As a global society, we're battling what can feel like an endless stream of ""bad news"" and overstimulation.</strong> Paradoxically, the very technologies meant to simplify our lives and connect us to one another can leave us feeling anxious, overwhelmed, and further <i>disconnected</i> from ourselves.    </p>
<p><strong>This project is a call to reconnect, both with ourselves and those around us, through the immense and often mysterious powers of sound and music.</strong> Together we will explore a wide variety of the healing modalities that can be seen and heard across the world today, and reflect on how they can be implemented in our increasingly complex lives. </p>

Worldwide Musicians United (WWMU) is an international nonprofit based in San Diego and Buenos Aires. We work with emerging artists around the world, facilitating cross-cultural collaborations and supporting musicians everywhere to create positive change in their local communities. We are a qualified 501(c)(3) organization registered in the United States, with an ever-growing network of members, partners, and supporters from across the globe.
Since our inception in 2015, we've implemented a wide range of successful projects, including: building a recording studio/community hub from the ground up in Uganda, putting on workshops and live performances with an indigenous community in Argentina, collaborating on a songwriting and music therapy project with refugee girls in the U.S., recording singles and albums with talented and deserving artists in need, facilitating international collaborations between musicians all over the world...and MUCH more!   

What We're Creating Next...
Through this campaign, we're establishing the first ever ""Global Sound Healing Alliance."" We've identified an extraordinary group of musicians, music therapists, and sound healers from all over the planet. Their diverse techniques range from the ancient to the cutting edge, but their goal is the same: using sound to promote healing and enhance the wellbeing of their fellow humans...like YOU. 

Each of these innovators does unique and deeply impactful work in their own right. WWMU is already supporting them (and you will too by contributing to this campaign!) in an astounding array of endeavors: 

Producing new albums, consciously created to promote healing and wellbeing
Putting on interactive live events (like ""silent"", therapeutic concerts with wireless headphones in beautiful outdoor settings)
Providing music therapy and workshops in schools, orphanages, prisons, shelters, festivals, and corporate board rooms  
Bringing traditional drumming and dance, along with yoga and healing workshops, across borders and into refugee camps in East Africa 
Creating a ""duet"" between the brainwaves of a meditating musician and frequencies generated from the biodata of a tree! And more...  


But another main goal of this project is to bring all of these amazing healers together, to witness and document the resulting synergy and new discoveries that arise. 
We'll achieve this by creating the following: 


A documentary film featuring interviews with each healer about their work and impact 

A musical compilation featuring songs and meditation tracks from individual participants, as well as new collaborative recordings created together

Educational materials so that their knowledge and experience can be passed on to others 

A new international community that will continue to grow for years to come (imagine a ""United Nations"" made up of sound healers!) with the goal of creating a healthier world for all of us... 


The Impact
The world we live in is complicated, extremely fast-paced, and not without its share of catastrophes and suffering. As a global society, we're battling what can feel like an endless stream of ""bad news"" and overstimulation. Paradoxically, the very technologies meant to simplify our lives and connect us to one another can leave us feeling anxious, overwhelmed, and further disconnected from ourselves.    
This project is a call to reconnect, both with ourselves and those around us, through the immense and often mysterious powers of sound and music. Together we will explore a wide variety of the healing modalities that can be seen and heard across the world today, and reflect on how they can be implemented in our increasingly complex lives. 

Your support will allow us to document this entire process, create new recordings and educational materials, and democratize the findings to a much larger audience. And if we fully reach our goal, we'll even be able to host an inaugural, in-person summit next year in Buenos Aires for the amazing healers that we'll be following throughout this project. 
These inspiring individuals have devoted their lives to helping and healing others; this campaign is not only a chance to help them do so on a larger scale, but also an opportunity to reap the healing benefits in your own life! 

What We Need & What You'll Get

Aside from proudly identifying as a wife, mother and grandmother, as well as sister, daughter, and friend, she is also a passionate community developer. Deborah recognizes from her own experience how important it is to address the systems in which people live and work if we want to truly help change lives. She has shared her music to raise money for another charity, and share her own experiences and insights. She has seen the impact it has had in the lives of others but declined to promote herself and jump in a van to tour with a band, so she could raise her family, go to university, and run community support companies. For over two decades Deborah has been writing and sharing her music with a limited audience, moving, inspiring and giving a voice to many. And for almost that same amount of time she has been working to build community supports with limited budgets, at the whim of political tides and government funding and amidst the challenges of local engagement.</p><p>She has run a not for profit, then started her own social benefit business and founded another not for profit soon to be registered as a charity; with a small group of amazing and intrepid humans, developing and running affordable supportive housing, creating community inclusion and momentum centres, building support programs for barriered individuals, researching best practices in community alignment to end homelessness, creating social enterprises to provide sustainability and employment.</p><p>After working with a shoestring budget to make good things happen from nothing, trying to engage supporters, donors and investors, but getting such positive feedback from her music, she did some math, and realized that she had a way of making her own money to Do More Good.  If she can get enough people to purchase downloads of all of her songs, and share this opportunity with their networks, she can literally raise millions of dollars to go toward building the kinds of community supports she knows need to happen. Sharing some wisdom, hope and joy, and making money to help make good things happen is what it's all about for this lady. </p><p>This is a passive campaign, with the goal of engaging many people, sharing awareness, and raising money that Deborah and her team can use towards projects that will make a difference to so many people.  </p><p>By purchasing the perks offered, you will be contributing much needed funding to help Deborah and the organizations she has developed over the last few years, to accelerate their efforts.  This money will go towards building sustainable affordable housing, start businesses that employ barriered individuals, help develop a trauma healing program, start a charter school to help fellow humans that are falling through the cracks, in a holistic, interconnected web of community care, alignment, and action.  We hope that this musical fundraiser will grow and attract other artists who want to share their music for a good cause and a little promotion (All of the writers, musicians, and technicians involved in making these songs will receive a portion of the revenues, which helps local and aspiring artists make a living from their craft). The remainder of the revenues will go towards housing and community development projects in Grande Prairie and Red Deer, Alberta. For those who don't live in these areas,  send us a message with information about your favorite local causes, and 30% of the rest of the revenues from the campaign can be earmarked for those causes, to help Do More Good everywhere. </p><p>This campaign offers  a number of levels of contribution for many different perks. Whether or not you participate in this fundraiser, please consider passing on the link to your friends, loved ones, other family members, colleagues, neighbours, etc. </p><p>These Perks also make for great gifts, especially during this time of social distancing as it is digital and can be easily attached to an email with a cute e-card!  All orders for perks $1 - $150 that are submitted and paid for by December 23rd will be fulfilled before Christmas so you can send your loved ones a digital gift!</p><p>Preview the full albums here: <a href=""https://www.dmgdomoregood.org/music-for-good"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.dmgdomoregood.org/music-for-good</a> - then come back and purchase through the campaign for a discount!</p><p>Perks Include:</p><p>Purchase one complete album to download (Rootseller or Shadows to Light) for $12 dollars or get both albums for $22 dollars.</p><p>$30 will get you your choice of up to 15 songs and a $20 off coupon for an eclectic gift  from our online store.</p><p>$50 will get you your choice of up to 15 songs, and a $40 off coupon for an eclectic gift or service from our store. </p><p>$75 will get you your choice of up to 15 songs, and a $65 off coupon for an eclectic gift or service from our online store. </p><p>$150 dollars will get you both albums to download, and a $140 off coupon for an eclectic gift or service from our online store. </p><p>For $500 dollars I will create personalized lyrics for you set to a tune from a public domain song (allow 6 to 8 weeks for delivery, and a one on one consultation with Deborah).</p><p>For $1000 dollars Deborah will provide a pre-recorded 2 hour virtual concert for you and a few close friends!  (allow 12 to 14 weeks for delivery, and a one on one consultation with Deborah).</p><p>for $5000 dollars Deborah will write an original customized song (music and lyrics) for a special occasion or as a tribute to a special person in your life (allow 8 to 12 weeks for delivery, and a one on one consultation with Deborah). </p><p>As time goes on we will offer other items, services, and opportunities as well as add more songs to the campaign and in our online store, so stay tuned! </p><p>Share the Care (Spread the Love) opportunity:</p><p>DMG Do More Good exists to bring resources and opportunities to communities that are not well served. Our hope is to grow enough to help many struggling communities help their people meet important needs for housing, community care, and employment opportunities. We are starting in Red Deer and Grande Prairie Alberta, because that is where we are, and we will grow from there. BUT we know this campaign will spread far and wide. Many of you will say, ""while the music is amazing, and the online store options are great, what will this do for the people where I live, or the things I care about?""</p><p>If you wish it, we want to help you help your community or charity of choice as well! So... when you get our email with your music link and online store voucher,  get your community on the DMG Share the Care (Spread the Love) radar by telling us the community or charity/cause that you want to support and we will earmark 30% of the profits for your Share the Care (Spread the Love) choice. At the end of the campaign we will 1.) send the donations to the named charities/causes and send you a tally of all that we collected to that charity, 2.) bank dollars earmarked for specific communities and use them toward helping good things happen in those communities. Maybe you have a special project you would like to see happen in your town. Get your friends, neighbours and loved ones to join in the campaign and increase those dollars to your favourite cause or community project, as well as get your community on the DMG map and help us make good things happen in your community. </p><p>This campaign is a little bit unique in that we don't have a  set ""goal"" or amount we are aiming for or bust. We just want to make some money in a passive, ongoing way to help us get started on some important projects that are designed to be sustainable. The more money we raise, the faster we can get moving, and the more we can do!  We also hope this will build our online community and bring awareness to our cause.</p><p>There are good things happening all over, people are trying to make a difference in all the ways they can. So many generous people trying to help out others. But so many people continue to fall through the cracks, projects fail, and important resources are wasted because of a lack of connection, coordination and/or collaboration in a community.</p><p>Our aim is to contribute to those resources in smart and sustainable ways, through an integrated, collaborative development process that engages all parts of the community and the person who needs help in a partnership toward thrive-ability, using what is locally available and building on that to provide ways, means, and opportunities for struggling individuals, their community neighbours, supporting organizations, business, and government to work together to change the way we do community.</p><p>These are the elements that need to be in place for us to break the cycles of poverty, homelessness, despair and dysfunction that create so much demand on our systems, and it takes resources to help it happen:</p><p> 1.  Housing that pays for itself and lasts a long, long time; whether new builds or retrofits and reclamations, using smart technologies and eco-principles that keep down costs and support self-reliance.</p><p>2.  Work experience and employment opportunities that help people connect with and integrate into the workplace </p><p>3.  Trauma healing that gets to the core of crisis and ends destructive cycles, </p><p>4.  Upstream interventions like specialized charter schools to offer alternatives for education that help keep kids in school and prepare them for their best life </p><p>5.  Expression and wisdom sharing to increase understanding and compassion and help towards healing</p><p>6.  CommUNITY projects that help develop neighbourhoods and communities of care where no one is left behind and everyone has the support they need to be successful,  </p><p>7.  Local economic opportunities and investment opportunities that help grow self-reliance, local resources and local wealth,</p><p>8.  Helping communities mindfully overhaul their systems ( so they can do a better job of helping their struggling  members to do the same) </p><p>Our teams at HeARTh Social Profit Company and DMG (Do More Good) Social Benefit Housing and Community Development Corporation have a lot of experience building something from next to nothing, through hard work, innovation and creativity, engaging good people, helping our participants see and feel their worth, value, and potential and providing the environment they need to thrive; our team has decades of combined experience. Our experiences range from developing affordable, supported housing on a shoestring and actually seeing a profit, to creating inclusive community centres and getting our landlords on side to see the social and community return on investment, to creatively developing social enterprise businesses, to producing programs for skill development and inclusion and providing effective support for at risk kids, street-involved individuals, persons in recovery from addiction or mental illness, and persons with developmental disabilities.  We have accomplished everything we have set out to do in our  journey so far, toward a vision for communities of care, with very limited resources. Just think what we can do if we have the potential funding from this fundraiser to be going on with! We will be able to help so many people!</p><p>With community, the biggest hurdle to getting important projects or changes in motion is buy-in. And the biggest solution to this hurdle is to have our own dollars that we can use to ""prime the pump"" and kick start the effort, and investment we need to help good things happen. </p><p>To help people be successful in interventions we need to be prepared to provide for their next steps. Business based approaches which include multi- layered, mixed and mutually beneficial focuses provide for sustainability and a more holistic set of resources that help move people forward. Designing our projects to be sustainable helps us ensure they will continue to be available for a long, long time, and that we are continuously making revenues to go towards next steps. </p><p>Big projects that solve big problems and have resources to back them up bring communities together and germinate collective impact and collaboration. But even small gains have an impact on engagement, create hope, and contribute to the buy-in for a better way of doing community. </p><p>Our team is really good at making things happen with limited resources, so we have the skills to make the most out of every dollar.  We also have a clear and strong vision of a holistic community of care that has never waivered or diminished, while we have the flexibility and creativity to take what comes our way and make the most of it in support of that vision. We hope you will join us in making things better by participating in this Musical Fundraiser.

Whether or not you participate in this fundraiser, please consider passing on the link to your friends, loved ones, other family members, colleagues, neighbours, etc. These Perks also make for great gifts, especially during this time of social distancing as it is digital and can be easily attached to an email with a cute e-card!  All orders for perks $1 - $150 that are submitted and paid for by December 23rd will be fulfilled before Christmas so you can send your loved ones a digital gift!Preview the full albums here: https://www.dmgdomoregood.org/music-for-good - then come back and purchase through the campaign for a discount!Perks Include:Purchase one complete album to download (Rootseller or Shadows to Light) for $12 dollars or get both albums for $22 dollars.$30 will get you your choice of up to 15 songs and a $20 off coupon for an eclectic gift  from our online store.$50 will get you your choice of up to 15 songs, and a $40 off coupon for an eclectic gift or service from our store. $75 will get you your choice of up to 15 songs, and a $65 off coupon for an eclectic gift or service from our online store. $150 dollars will get you both albums to download, and a $140 off coupon for an eclectic gift or service from our online store. For $500 dollars I will create personalized lyrics for you set to a tune from a public domain song (allow 6 to 8 weeks for delivery, and a one on one consultation with Deborah).For $1000 dollars Deborah will provide a pre-recorded 2 hour virtual concert for you and a few close friends!  (allow 12 to 14 weeks for delivery, and a one on one consultation with Deborah).for $5000 dollars Deborah will write an original customized song (music and lyrics) for a special occasion or as a tribute to a special person in your life (allow 8 to 12 weeks for delivery, and a one on one consultation with Deborah). As time goes on we will offer other items, services, and opportunities as well as add more songs to the campaign and in our online store, so stay tuned! Share the Care (Spread the Love) opportunity:DMG Do More Good exists to bring resources and opportunities to communities that are not well served. Our hope is to grow enough to help many struggling communities help their people meet important needs for housing, community care, and employment opportunities. We are starting in Red Deer and Grande Prairie Alberta, because that is where we are, and we will grow from there. BUT we know this campaign will spread far and wide. Many of you will say, ""while the music is amazing, and the online store options are great, what will this do for the people where I live, or the things I care about?""If you wish it, we want to help you help your community or charity of choice as well! So... when you get our email with your music link and online store voucher,  get your community on the DMG Share the Care (Spread the Love) radar by telling us the community or charity/cause that you want to support and we will earmark 30% of the profits for your Share the Care (Spread the Love) choice. At the end of the campaign we will 1.) send the donations to the named charities/causes and send you a tally of all that we collected to that charity, 2.) bank dollars earmarked for specific communities and use them toward helping good things happen in those communities. Maybe you have a special project you would like to see happen in your town. Get your friends, neighbours and loved ones to join in the campaign and increase those dollars to your favourite cause or community project, as well as get your community on the DMG map and help us make good things happen in your community. This campaign is a little bit unique in that we don't have a  set ""goal"" or amount we are aiming for or bust. We just want to make some money in a passive, ongoing way to help us get started on some important projects that are designed to be sustainable. The more money we raise, the faster we can get moving, and the more we can do!  We also hope this will build our online community and bring awareness to our cause.There are good things happening all over, people are trying to make a difference in all the ways they can. So many generous people trying to help out others. But so many people continue to fall through the cracks, projects fail, and important resources are wasted because of a lack of connection, coordination and/or collaboration in a community.Our aim is to contribute to those resources in smart and sustainable ways, through an integrated, collaborative development process that engages all parts of the community and the person who needs help in a partnership toward thrive-ability, using what is locally available and building on that to provide ways, means, and opportunities for struggling individuals, their community neighbours, supporting organizations, business, and government to work together to change the way we do community.These are the elements that need to be in place for us to break the cycles of poverty, homelessness, despair and dysfunction that create so much demand on our systems, and it takes resources to help it happen: 1.  Housing that pays for itself and lasts a long, long time; whether new builds or retrofits and reclamations, using smart technologies and eco-principles that keep down costs and support self-reliance.2.  Work experience and employment opportunities that help people connect with and integrate into the workplace 3.  Trauma healing that gets to the core of crisis and ends destructive cycles, 4.  Upstream interventions like specialized charter schools to offer alternatives for education that help keep kids in school and prepare them for their best life 5.  Expression and wisdom sharing to increase understanding and compassion and help towards healing6.  CommUNITY projects that help develop neighbourhoods and communities of care where no one is left behind and everyone has the support they need to be successful,  7.  Local economic opportunities and investment opportunities that help grow self-reliance, local resources and local wealth,8.  Helping communities mindfully overhaul their systems ( so they can do a better job of helping their struggling  members to do the same) Our teams at HeARTh Social Profit Company and DMG (Do More Good) Social Benefit Housing and Community Development Corporation have a lot of experience building something from next to nothing, through hard work, innovation and creativity, engaging good people, helping our participants see and feel their worth, value, and potential and providing the environment they need to thrive; our team has decades of combined experience. Our experiences range from developing affordable, supported housing on a shoestring and actually seeing a profit, to creating inclusive community centres and getting our landlords on side to see the social and community return on investment, to creatively developing social enterprise businesses, to producing programs for skill development and inclusion and providing effective support for at risk kids, street-involved individuals, persons in recovery from addiction or mental illness, and persons with developmental disabilities.  We have accomplished everything we have set out to do in our  journey so far, toward a vision for communities of care, with very limited resources. Just think what we can do if we have the potential funding from this fundraiser to be going on with! We will be able to help so many people!With community, the biggest hurdle to getting important projects or changes in motion is buy-in. And the biggest solution to this hurdle is to have our own dollars that we can use to ""prime the pump"" and kick start the effort, and investment we need to help good things happen. To help people be successful in interventions we need to be prepared to provide for their next steps. Business based approaches which include multi- layered, mixed and mutually beneficial focuses provide for sustainability and a more holistic set of resources that help move people forward. Designing our projects to be sustainable helps us ensure they will continue to be available for a long, long time, and that we are continuously making revenues to go towards next steps. Big projects that solve big problems and have resources to back them up bring communities together and germinate collective impact and collaboration. But even small gains have an impact on engagement, create hope, and contribute to the buy-in for a better way of doing community. Our team is really good at making things happen with limited resources, so we have the skills to make the most out of every dollar.  We also have a clear and strong vision of a holistic community of care that has never waivered or diminished, while we have the flexibility and creativity to take what comes our way and make the most of it in support of that vision. We hope you will join us in making things better by participating in this Musical Fundraiser. Enjoy!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Who the f_ck are these guys?  And what are they doing?</h3>
<p>We are Love Coma, an indie band from San Antonio, TX.  We formed in the early 1990s and disbanded at the end of that decade.  After 25 years since our last recorded work together, we have released a brand new project that dropped on October 27th of 2020.  </p>
<p>Because we are an indie band, it means that we are not affiliated with any record label or any benefactors - everything we do is self-funded!  This affords us the opportunity to maintain the creative and artistic control over everything we release, but it also means that we don't have the finances or the marketing strength of a machine behind us.  (It also means means that we are unable to release our projects as quickly as we'd like to be able to.)</p>
<p>A few points of interest in better understanding the challenges we face as artists trying create new music and release it into the world are outlined below:</p>
<p>Recording new material is time consuming and studio time is expensive.   </p>
<p>Mixing and mastering of new music is expensive. </p>
<p>The design, the planning, and the purchase of band merchandise is expensive. </p>
<p>The process of manufacturing vinyl is <i><strong>hella-expensive! </strong></i></p>
<p>This is where <i><strong>YOU</strong></i>, our valued fans and listeners, can participate in helping us to complete this endeavor.  The majority of the costs associated with the making of the new album have already been funded and paid for. </p>
<p>We recorded these new songs throughout 2019 and 2020 at The Zone in the heart of the Texas Hill Country.  Pat Manske engineered and mixed the album, and co-produced as well.  For more on Pat and The Zone recording studio, see them here: <a href=""http://www.thezonerecordingstudio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.thezonerecordingstudio.com/</a></p>
<p>Scott Hull mastered the released for all formats (digital streaming, CD, and vinyl).  Scott is a Grammy Award winning engineer who has 30+ years in the industry.  He has mastered many major label releases by Steely Dan, Sting, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, John Mayer, and countless others.   For more about Scott, check him out online here: <a href=""https://masterdisk.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://masterdisk.com/</a></p>
<p>To celebrate this release, we are pressing specialty vinyl that will be manufactured in an ultra-clear vinyl with white splatter.  The cost of pressing the vinyl and the cost foe the album artwork and packaging is in excess of $5,000.  Every contribution we receive from this campaign will be applied to the costs of pressing this vinyl. </p>
<p>Hopefully you are as excited about the prospect of listening to the new Love Coma album on vinyl as we are, and it is our hope that you'll consider participating in this campaign to join us in the completion of this project!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Okay.  What do you need and what will I get?</h3>
<p>To break it down for everybody in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>As was mentioned above, the cost of vinyl manufacturing is not cheap.  The pressing of these new albums is in excess of $5,000.</li>
<li>We are pressing 500 copies of this album in ultra-clear vinyl with white splatter</li>
<li>These albums will be numbered from 1-500 in silver foil.</li>
<li>Included in each vinyl album jacket will be a card with a code for a download of the digital release.</li>
<li>We have an assortment of special edition stickers, buttons, and fridge magnets we're including for our campaign contributors in each package.</li>
<li>Additionally, we are also offering a deluxe package that will include Chris Taylor's double-vinyl release ""Lovers, Thieves, Fools, + Pretenders"".</li>
<li>Lastly, for an additional contribution, Chris Taylor is offering to paint custom album covers for either one or both of the albums included.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>So when should I expect for my new vinyl album package to arrive?</h3>
<p>The process of the pressing of this project is already underway.  We expect these to new vinyl albums be pressed, packaged, numbered, and shipped to our Mothership HQ in San Antonio, TX by the end of March, 2021.  Due to any unforeseen circumstances related to Covid-19 and the ongoing pandemic, this timeline may change slightly.  The shipping of these albums to their new homes will begin promptly once we have them in our hot little hands!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The holidays are upon us and the new year is just around the corner - I'm broke!  How else can I participate?</h3>
<p>It's all good.  We get it.  There will be plenty of vinyl albums available for purchase once the campaign has ended.  The going cost of the Love Coma vinyl release will be $30, but we only printed enough stickers, buttons, and magnets for the campaign contributors.  (We promise that we'll have other fun items in the future for those who cannot participate this time around!) </p>

Surviving solely in basement bars and the mud covered fields of Europe and America, this film tells the tale of those who stand tall against an industry manufactured to sell Pop Stars.  From current musicians and promoters, to record labels, to the fans whose loyalty never wavers, this project probes the history and evolution of a brutal and often controversial form of music known as Death Metal, and the artists determined to keep “The Growl” alive.</p><p>   With little to no radio play or industry support, this underground style has been around for over 30 years, and yet, has barely scratched the mainstream veneer. Instead, it has managed to thrive and even inspire its own sub-genres along the way: Brutal Death Metal, Industrial Death Metal, Melodic Death Metal and Slam Death Metal are just a few of the categories.  Rabidog Films goes behind the scenes and converses with some of the top Death Metal bands and new up-and-comers, to find out who gave birth to “The Growl” and its genesis of overly aggressive music. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549165639/afseb8stik6ca01hlfuy.png"" src=""""/>   </p><p>  Exploring the influences and inspirations of these bands and their members, we discover what inevitably keeps them marching in a landscape that offers little glory or financial gain.

I myself have been involved in the underground landscape since 1990, and have forever been entrenched within the scene in some way or another since then. My ceaseless passion for Death Metal culture has lead me down many paths including, playing in a Death Metal band, promoting and organizing local Death Metal shows, published a zine called DISGORGED PANDEMONIUM,  and I co-hosted a metal radio show in the Niagara Region called CHRONIC AGGRESSION from 1997 to 2002.  Then again from 2012 to 2015 airing on CFBU 103.7 FM.</p><p>  The focus of this project is to discuss with, and involve the most influential legends and underground heroes (new and old) that have shaped and nurtured this subversive style of music. Obtaining such interviews has proven challenging at times as we have been limited to our travel capabilities. In order to make this documentary a reality, our ambition is to visit ""Death Metal"" home base locations in order to obtain the gritty testimonials, the history, the anecdotes, etc., from bands, labels, zine makers, tape traders, and so forth. So, we're asking you to lend a hand become a part of Death Metal history and help us achieve our goal in collecting these stories.  So much is yet untold and we want to share to the world what Death Metal is all about.</p><p>   So if you are a fan of Death Metal and want to see this project succeed....GET INVOLVED!  Check out our perks section for exclusive merchandise , support THE GROWL, and headbang forever!</p><p> </p><p><u><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549826804/bcyw5ifzl9wbovmgxea5.jpg"" src=""""/></u></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549771594/dmrztjhz748gpptxopoc.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>   The brainchild of Phil Pattison, Jeff Beckman and David Montour, Rabidog Films was established in early 2003. Rabidog’s roots were forged in the same bowels as extreme and heavy music, resulting in a micro-budget, over the top, punk-rock-zombie feature film titled: <a href=""https://youtu.be/RRpPqNiVaOs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Vs. the Dead</a>. The film’s soundtrack features the music of legendary artists such as Integrity, Zyklon, The Dayglo Abortions, Fucked Up, and many more; plus even included a scene featuring Death Metal icons: Exhumed.

Surviving solely in basement bars and the mud covered fields of Europe and America, this film tells the tale of those who stand tall against an industry manufactured to sell Pop Stars.  From current musicians and promoters, to record labels, to the fans whose loyalty never wavers, this project probes the history and evolution of a brutal and often controversial form of music known as Death Metal, and the artists determined to keep “The Growl” alive.   With little to no radio play or industry support, this underground style has been around for over 30 years, and yet, has barely scratched the mainstream veneer. Instead, it has managed to thrive and even inspire its own sub-genres along the way: Brutal Death Metal, Industrial Death Metal, Melodic Death Metal and Slam Death Metal are just a few of the categories.  Rabidog Films goes behind the scenes and converses with some of the top Death Metal bands and new up-and-comers, to find out who gave birth to “The Growl” and its genesis of overly aggressive music.      Exploring the influences and inspirations of these bands and their members, we discover what inevitably keeps them marching in a landscape that offers little glory or financial gain. Dissecting how Death Metal prospers without the help of popular advertising platforms, the importance of tape trading, fanzines, album art, the future of Death Metal, Death Metal in popular culture, and its survival in this current age of online file sharing, streaming and downloading. An essential guide for diehard fans or an introduction for those new to this non-glamourous genre, The Growl is a must see documentary for any music fan.    My name is Cam Schwarz, aka “Cannibal Cam”.  Along with my best friend and Rabidog Films partner, Phil Pattison, we bring you what we feel is the essential comprehensive documentary and essential guide to the Death Metal scene ever. I myself have been involved in the underground landscape since 1990, and have forever been entrenched within the scene in some way or another since then. My ceaseless passion for Death Metal culture has lead me down many paths including, playing in a Death Metal band, promoting and organizing local Death Metal shows, published a zine called DISGORGED PANDEMONIUM,  and I co-hosted a metal radio show in the Niagara Region called CHRONIC AGGRESSION from 1997 to 2002.  Then again from 2012 to 2015 airing on CFBU 103.7 FM.  The focus of this project is to discuss with, and involve the most influential legends and underground heroes (new and old) that have shaped and nurtured this subversive style of music. Obtaining such interviews has proven challenging at times as we have been limited to our travel capabilities. In order to make this documentary a reality, our ambition is to visit ""Death Metal"" home base locations in order to obtain the gritty testimonials, the history, the anecdotes, etc., from bands, labels, zine makers, tape traders, and so forth. So, we're asking you to lend a hand become a part of Death Metal history and help us achieve our goal in collecting these stories.  So much is yet untold and we want to share to the world what Death Metal is all about.   So if you are a fan of Death Metal and want to see this project succeed....GET INVOLVED!  Check out our perks section for exclusive merchandise , support THE GROWL, and headbang forever!    The brainchild of Phil Pattison, Jeff Beckman and David Montour, Rabidog Films was established in early 2003. Rabidog’s roots were forged in the same bowels as extreme and heavy music, resulting in a micro-budget, over the top, punk-rock-zombie feature film titled: Vs. the Dead. The film’s soundtrack features the music of legendary artists such as Integrity, Zyklon, The Dayglo Abortions, Fucked Up, and many more; plus even included a scene featuring Death Metal icons: Exhumed. However, that particular scene didn’t make it into the final cut. Funding for the project was raised solely by a series of punk rock/hardcore/metal shows held over a period of two years. Vs. the Dead was released in North America by Midnight Releasing in 2009, available through VOD and DVD platforms. It can currently be seen on YouTube, where it has achieved nearly 200,000 views. Unfortunately, by the time of the film’s eventual release, everyone involved with Vs. the Dead had already changed their focus to more personal matters, leaving Rabidog Films to whither away in a solitary kennel.   After leaving Rabidog Films—yet keeping his passion for horror films alive—Phil co-founded Nictopohobia Films with Christopher Harrison, in 2008, where he also connected with future Rabidog Films partner, “Cannibal” Cam Schwarz.

<p>Hi there. My name is Dave Long. I know this is the best music I've ever written and recorded in my life. I've been playing live in a million bands since I was 16 and this exciting, hard rocking music is the culmination of all my musical experiences. As an artist, I need to get this out to the public and no recording or performance has ever been more important to me. With just a little bit of your help, I can finish this recording and release it on all current media platforms.</p>
<p>I have set my budget very low at just $2200. That is because I’m getting tremendous support from my recording engineer and producer Ray Smith. His work on the Muscle Shoals soundtrack and many other projects is legendary. This is a process and includes basic track recording, overdub of guitars, bass, and vocals, backup vocals, mixing, mastering, and configuring for different media like CDs, Spotify, CD Baby, iTunes, etc. And finally releasing on the websites and physically. Of course each one of these takes time and money.</p>
<p>Perks will include, digital downloads, a CD, personal updates, exclusive video, and T-shirts, and maybe even a concert in your house!</p>
<p>Whether I reach goal or not, any funds will be utilized to support the record, which is already in process. Six songs are being recorded. Two studio dates and three songs have already provided exciting results. Two more dates and three more songs are scheduled for the end of this month. </p>
<p>This music has the potential to gain wider release and I will be working with top professionals in the industry to make that happen and get this heard.</p>
<p>In previews, songs are already in consideration for a movie project and we will be working   to license to TV and movies.</p>
<p>This is the most serious music release of my life to date.</p>
<p>I know I’m taking a risk, but I know the rewards will be worth it. I’d very much appreciate your support and your help in getting the word out. </p>

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hey everybody! My name is Josh, and I'm a junior Jazz Studies major at Vanderbilt University. I've been playing piano since I was 6 years old. After my first piano recital, I was hooked - I fell completely in love with performing live. Since then, I've played with jazz groups, jam bands, and classical ensembles.  After years of exploring all of these genres, I'm ready to embark on my first major recording project.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>About the Project</h3>
<p>This fall, I started writing the music for my debut album, <i>The Root of the Thing</i>. The album is going to feature seven original compositions for jazz combo and my take on a classic jazz standard.  Each song on this album is about an important person in my life. I believe that the themes I'm writing about are universal and I hope that listeners can find something in each song that resonates with them. To write this album, I had to pull from a ton of different influences including jazz, jam band, funk, gospel, and classical music. This unique blend of genres gives the album a distinct sound that I can't wait to share with all of you!</p>
<p><i>The Root of the Thing</i> will be a collaboration between my talented friends at Vanderbilt University and seasoned musicians from the Nashville music industry. The goal is to record the project in a professional Nashville recording studio, with both students and pro players at the session. Ultimately, I hope this album can create lasting relationships between Vanderbilt and Nashville's music scene.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Fundraising Goal</h3>
<p>Making an album is an expensive process, and I'll need some help raising funds. My goal is to raise $6,500 to cover the cost of studio time, mixing, capturing video, and paying musicians. Here's where the money is going:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1,300 for studio time</li>
<li>$2,500 for mixing and mastering</li>
<li>$2,000 for paying the musicians</li>
<li>$300 for video on 2-3 songs</li>
<li>$400 for miscellaneous costs (marketing, album cover design, overdubs, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition, a portion of each donation will be going to Artist Relief, a charity which provides emergency funding to artists facing financial hardship due to COVID-19. Check them out at <a href=""https://www.artistrelief.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.artistrelief.org/</a></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What's In It For You?</h3>
<p>With each donation of $20 or more, you will receive an early download of the album and video content a week before their release date. Here are some other perks you can get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Charts for each song on the album</li>
<li>I'll learn one of your favorite songs and record a piano cover for you</li>
<li>A 1hr Zoom piano lesson</li>
<li>I can record piano or keyboard tracks for your music</li>
<li>An original song written for you or someone you know</li>
<li>A live, 1hr set of piano music (in person or remote)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Timeline</h3>
<p>Ideally, I'll be recording in Spring 2021 and the album will be released in Fall 2021. This timeline may change due to COVID-19, but I am dedicated to finishing this album before I graduate in Spring 2022. I'm going to release a single or two before the album release, so stay tuned!</p>

<p><strong>QUIÉNES SOMOS</strong></p>
<p>El Temporal existe desde el 2006, fundado por cuatro almas caminantes que se encontraron en otro extremo de donde nacieron, actualmente conformado por Amalia Schargrodsky (Argentina), Carlo Massarelli (Italia), Güicho Vargas (México) y Nico del Pan (Francia).</p>
<p>Estamos enamorados de la música tradicional de los pueblos, por esto tocamos son jarocho, un género musical mexicano que se funda del mestizaje de diferentes culturas; africana, indígena, árabe y española que se cruzaron hace alrededor de cuatro siglos en el estado de Veracruz.</p>
<p><strong>FUSIÓN JAROCHA</strong></p>
<p>En la actualidad el son jarocho es representante con enorme impacto a nivel mundial del regreso del pueblo a su tradición y nosotros por nuestra propia realidad de extranjeros (o migrantes) en estas tierras, lo fusionamos con sonidos étnicos de otros lados del mundo.</p>
<p>Después de un laborioso trabajo de tres años, hemos recopilado nuestras ideas musicales en un álbum, que estamos a punto de terminar. El disco suena increíble y les aseguramos que ¡nunca antes han escuchado un son jarocho así!</p>
<p><strong>LA MIGRACIÓN</strong></p>
<p>""La Migración"" es la pieza que da el nombre al disco y es una composición original que trata sobre un tema muy actual, que nos preocupa mucho y el cual como artistas sentimos la responsabilidad de abordar. ¿Por qué? Porque todos somos de un mismo mundo, un mundo sin fronteras, pero dividido por líneas dibujadas con crayón. Un mundo un tanto desigual, donde el racismo se ha vuelto una normalidad, donde se le rompe el corazón y el alma a los que menos tienen y se les abre camino fácilmente a los que más.</p>
<p>Como humanos siempre hemos caminado: el deseo, el hambre y algunas veces la necesidad de derribar muros nos han hecho explorar nuevos mundos. Y nadie dice que es fácil abandonar tus raíces, tu hogar, tu familia; sin embargo, a veces nuestros pies y nuestros corazones están hechos para volar alto, volar lejos, migrar.</p>

<p>   <br/>   I remember when I was 9 years old and I had just emigrated to the United States. I was afraid of pretty much everything, except the comforts of my room. It was a tradition in my adoptive family to go out to eat after church every week. One Sunday, we went to a McDonald’s, and I had a coke with my “Happy” Meal. I wanted a straw, but I didn’t want to go to the counter to ask for one. I was always nervous to ask for things, and worried I’d hear the word “no.” So instead, I decided to take the top off the cup and drink it that way. From that point on, I made a lot of my decisions in my life that way: Don’t ask for anything, make do with what you got.</p>
<p>     I’m older and wiser now - I see that the only way to live life is to give and receive. I can ask for help. So, here it is: I’m asking for your help. Any donation will help me be one step closer to my goal - I’m making an album of new music! Thanks in advance for your love and support.</p>
<p>Look - I used to be scared that people would not accept me, that I’m too “old,” or too inexperienced, or not “good enough” in some way, to live my dreams… in that case, why record those songs? Then I took a step back, and I realized that the excitement of life bubbles up when we take on creative fulfillment, and that my ideas ARE, in fact, good enough - as long as I believe they are. Life is “worth living” every day that I pursue what matters to me. And if I can give you a moment of joy with the songs that are in my heart, that’s what I want to do. Let’s make it happen!</p>

Not only for the fact that the world stopped with all its consequences but also because those who love to dance Tango were not able to do so even until today. But Tango keeps going no matter what... During 2020 while I was producing a new album ""BANDONEON SOLILOQUY"" in a Kolker Klein Production, releasing LISANDRO ADROVER'S new work in bandoneon solos,  I was inspired about a fact. An interesting discovery.THE KOL NIDRE WHICH IS INTERPRETED AT THE EVENING SERVICE OF YOM KIPPUR WAS NEVER RECORDED IN BANDONEON. EVER.Being Jewish and a Tanguero,  working with an artist of the caliber of Lisandro Adrover,  doing some research I discovered that German composer MAX BRUCH, wrote this work for CELLO in 1880. He dedicated the work to the Jewish Community in the City of Liverpool when being  Director of the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra,I decided to go to the studio again with Lisandro and recorded it in two versions:1) Kol Nidre - Bandoneon Solo  2) Kol Nidre - Bandoneon & Strings  Note*: This album is already published on Bandcamp

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Jonathan Snyder. I am currently a doctoral candidate in horn performance at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. As part of my final document, sometimes referred to as a dissertation, I am taking on a MAJOR project! This project will be to record the first ever professional recording of a 15-minute Lithuanian horn concerto composed by Balys Dvarionas in 1963. This piece is nearly unknown outside of Lithuania, and the version of it that I plan to record is the original orchestral edition using the composer's original handwritten parts!</p>
<p>I am hoping that, by researching this piece, and creating this recording, it will help to shine a light on a wonderful piece in the horn repertoire. In addition, the recording will also be given to the Lithuanian Music Information Center to be included in their database and archives.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>This project is a very ambitious one. Especially as part of a DMA document. To do it, I will need to pay for time in the studio at UNLV, time for editing, mixing, and mastering, and a honorarium payment to the musicians.</p>
<p>Because this is an orchestral version, I will need 9 string players to be able to fill out the section. This will allow for 2 first violins, 2 second violins, 2 violas, 2 cellos, and a bass player. Many of the parts actually require 3 players. However, by using 9 players, and then recording those same players on additional passes on the other parts, it will help to fill out the sound with a smaller section, while also providing a much higher quality and more natural sound than simply doubling them digitally.</p>
<p>However, paying 9 players is expensive.</p>
<p>In speaking with the head of the recording studio at UNLV, he has agreed to lower the per hour price to $60/hour, down from $75. Based on his professional experience, he has suggested the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>2-3 hours per 4 minute section of music with the strings (12 total hours)</li>
<li>3-4 hours to record the solo horn part</li>
<li>9 hours for editing/mixing</li>
</ul>
<p>This equates to: 24 hours x $60 = $1,440 for the recording process.</p>
<p>PLUS:</p>
<p>9 musicians x $200 honorarium = $1,800 for the musicians</p>
<p>That's a total cost of: $3,240 !!!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>While the cost of this project is quite substantial, I hope it will have a large impact on the horn world.</p>
<ul>
<li>It will provide exposure to the horn world of a little known piece in the repertoire.</li>
<li>It will provide more exposure to Lithuanian music and composers.</li>
<li>It will provide the Lithuanian Music Information Center a recording for a piece they don't have.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Because of the substantial cost of the project, I absolutely cannot do it without substantial help. Without your help in reaching my goal I would need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cut the number of string players. This would still work. But, it would have a lower quality sound since we would be forced to digitally double the players.</li>
<li>We would have to record, edit, and mix faster. This would possibly lower the quality of the recording since we would be forced to settle for imperfections in the recording.</li>
<li>Worse case scenario is that I would be forced to record it and mix it myself in a hall with my limited selection of microphones. This is meant to be a professional recording and, while I do have some recording experience, it would not be the same as using a professional studio and engineer.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about this campaign.</li>
<li>Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!</li>
</ul>
</div><p> </p><p>Once the project is finished, I will be sending a copy to everyone who contributes. While everyone WILL get a digital copy, I am hoping that enough funds may be left for me to have physical copies made that can be sent as well.

It was only many years later that I discovered that the real gold is in the deep feelings, whether they be happy or sad.<strong> The real gold that creates connection are the feelings we are most trying to hide. That’s what this album is about.</strong></p><p>After five years of surgeries and waiting to get better, my thirst for seeing the world had become larger than my fear. Despite still not being able to walk, I left for Ecuador.</p><p>It was the scariest decision I have ever made, yet the one I am the most proud of. There, in Ecuador, I found spiritual healing, which changed my life forever and made me a believer of most things which spells energy. Guided by two healers, I found a practice that turned my world around and had me out of the wheelchair and running in the course of six months!  I also discovered that my voice wanted to be heard. The notes came bubbling out of me. </p><p>I have written songs my whole life, played the cello since age eight, sung in many choirs, and I studied music throughout middle and high school. However, it was only after going to the depths of my own despair and finding my way out of there that I learned what my music truly is about.</p><p>This album is a way for me to hold and embrace all parts of me, the dark and the light, the happy and the sad, and by doing so, I invite you to embrace all of you.</p><p><strong>The songs are written, recording has started - this Indiegogo campaign is the final step toward creating this all-embracing professionally produced studio album.</strong></p><h2><strong>What you’re supporting</strong></h2><p>This campaign is raising funds for making a professionally recorded album with JonJon Alevizakis, a kick-ass producer with many years in the game living in Nevada City. Together, JonJon and I are digging into my original material and arrangements, and bringing in other musicians to bring the songs to life.</p><p>I have been able to cover the costs of recording and producing one song, which is ready for you to check out right here on this page. This first song is called “Let Love Lead the Way” – check it out below!</p><div><div>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/SjpHq7t1dZU?rel=0?modestbranding=1&amp;amp;title=?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p>With its strong spirit, layered harmonies, ukulele back beat, and reggae drums it gives you a quick trip to the Caribbean and provides a great example of the album we’ll be able to create if this campaign is successful.<br/>This song is from the happy end of the spectrum – and provides a beautiful example of the celebration of life.</p>
</div></div><p>However, my music is very multifaceted and the songs vary in character and style a lot, even in language. I sing in French, Swedish and English, and sometimes in Spanish.</p><p><strong>This album is going to be released as singles, one per month for as many months as there are songs, culminating in a pressed album. How many songs there will be is up to you!</strong></p><p><b>By releasing the songs one by one, you will get access to the music AS SOON AS it is ready, rather than having to wait until the entire album is finished.</b></p><h2><strong>Flexible Goal – The Budget</strong></h2><p><strong>This project has a flexible goal, which means that the final product will depend on the funds we are able to raise. How many songs we are able to make is up to you!</strong></p><h3><strong>€ 4000</strong></h3><p>This will give us an EP with deep digging songs such as Let Love Lead the Way, the title track All I Am with its magnificent arrangement (13 strings and looots of vocals!), La Lune, which is a very French song, and one more song.</p><h3><strong>€ 7000</strong></h3><p>This will give us a longer EP, with tracks such as Eternal Vivid Bloom (a song with lyrics by Amir Masud, an incredible poet and friend of mine), the powerful rock/funk song Devil's Crossing, which connects us to the power in our own inner grief and despair, and a few more tracks. </p><h3><strong>€ 10 000</strong></h3><p>At this point, we have a full-length album! Hallelujah! Reaching this goal means we'll be able to produce an album of 10 songs, which is my vision for this project and my deepest hope. I have so many songs that are all competing to be on the album, and I would LOVE to record them and share them with you!</p><h3><strong>€ 13 000</strong></h3><p>Shout if from the roof tops! With 3000 euros for distribution the album will get the spread it deserves, and the music will reach far and wide across the planet, and touch all the hearts it is meant for! THANK YOU!</p><h3><strong>€ 16 000</strong></h3><p>At this point, I’m booking a tour, realizing a huge dream of mine! I will come play live in your city and hug you! YIPPIE YAY!</p><h2><strong>The funds will go toward</strong></h2><h3>1. Studio time.</h3><p>JonJon has an amazing studio with state-of-the-art equipment. Realizing my visions and recording the arrangements I write requires at least 10 hours in the studio per song… with the result that costs add up quickly. I do cut some corners in quality occasionally and record some backing cello in my home studio to keep the costs down… but ultimately, most of the work needs to be done at JonJon’s to get the quality we’re looking for.</p><h3>2. Editing, post-production, and mix, and mastering.</h3><p>JonJon and I split the editing tasks between us to keep cost down and frankly because I really enjoy having a say in all stages of the production. However, I recognize my limitations as an engineer. Your contribution will ensure the high quality of every stage of the production and mix, and JonJon’s steady guidance. Hallelujah for JonJon’s expertise! (Trust me, it’s worth it.)</p><h3>3. Musicians.</h3><p>Drums, for instance! While JonJon and I record most the instruments, we have our limitations. We have already recorded drums on a few songs with the one and only Mark McCartney, who is SO INSANELY GOOD! Just listen to Let Love Lead the Way. You’ll see what I mean.<br/>Recording drums is quite costly, but despite the high price we decided on going with live drums (instead of programmed). Because we have a really strong vision and high standards. </p><p>Here is a sneak peak from our recording session with Mark.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/HaXRKeJFrko?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p><br/>Other instruments that JonJon and I don't play are: Violin (we've got the amazing Victoria Stjerna on a track already!) and wind orchestra.</p><h3>4. Pressing physical CD's &amp; Distribution</h3><p>I want EVERYONE to hear this album! Together, we can spread this music and make sure it reaches the hearts of all the people it was made for! Which is, basically, anyone with feelings and who is willing to tap into the power of their vulnerability. <br/>The pressed CD will of course include artwork and a songbook with all the lyrics!</p><h2>For You</h2><p>I've created a bunch of Perks and gifts to show my gratitude for your support. They include some amazing artwork by Delena Britnell, along with house concerts, handwritten lyrics, the album itself (of course) in different bundles, and much more.

I have evolved as musician, producer and songwriter, and this production is bigger and more professional. I can't wait for you to hear it!</strong></p><h2>Risks and Challenges</h2><h3>1. Believing in myself</h3><p>It seems like I am in a constant battle with the voice inside of me that tells me I can't, I'm not good enough etc. It feels like I'm pushing against a rubber ceiling above my head, that every so often will break. I burst through and I say: ""HAA! I told you I could do it!"" to my inner choir of critics. When listening to the finished version of Let Love Lead the Way, for example, I burst through, and I feel immensely proud and happy.<br/>And then the ceiling is back again and I go back to pushing. I have accepted this resistance as part the process of creating, of breaking new ground. I know I can't get anywhere near to realizing my visions and dreams if I keep playing it safe and only go where I have been before. </p><h3>2. Receiving</h3><p>Making this crowdfunder! Holy cow, it has taken me a year to get it ready and to get myself ready to launch it. Asking for help is super hard, and to do it I need to address all the beliefs that tell me I'm not worthy of receiving it. As you can hear in my music I am fully human and far from sure of my worth, AND I am also determined to not let fear win. </p><p>Instead, I let love lead the way.</p></div>","My StoryMy story is one of heartache and grief, as well as an intense feeling of being alive, which are the pieces of me that made this album. An injury after a ski accident at age 16 prevented me from walking for about five years, paired with some real crawl-through-the-shit depression made for some really deep rich and authentic songs – which I initially, out of shame, would hide from the world.

Together, JonJon and I are digging into my original material and arrangements, and bringing in other musicians to bring the songs to life.I have been able to cover the costs of recording and producing one song, which is ready for you to check out right here on this page. This first song is called “Let Love Lead the Way” – check it out below!

 
With its strong spirit, layered harmonies, ukulele back beat, and reggae drums it gives you a quick trip to the Caribbean and provides a great example of the album we’ll be able to create if this campaign is successful.This song is from the happy end of the spectrum – and provides a beautiful example of the celebration of life.
However, my music is very multifaceted and the songs vary in character and style a lot, even in language. I sing in French, Swedish and English, and sometimes in Spanish.This album is going to be released as singles, one per month for as many months as there are songs, culminating in a pressed album. How many songs there will be is up to you!By releasing the songs one by one, you will get access to the music AS SOON AS it is ready, rather than having to wait until the entire album is finished.Flexible Goal – The BudgetThis project has a flexible goal, which means that the final product will depend on the funds we are able to raise. How many songs we are able to make is up to you!€ 4000This will give us an EP with deep digging songs such as Let Love Lead the Way, the title track All I Am with its magnificent arrangement (13 strings and looots of vocals!), La Lune, which is a very French song, and one more song.€ 7000This will give us a longer EP, with tracks such as Eternal Vivid Bloom (a song with lyrics by Amir Masud, an incredible poet and friend of mine), the powerful rock/funk song Devil's Crossing, which connects us to the power in our own inner grief and despair, and a few more tracks. € 10 000At this point, we have a full-length album! Hallelujah! Reaching this goal means we'll be able to produce an album of 10 songs, which is my vision for this project and my deepest hope. I have so many songs that are all competing to be on the album, and I would LOVE to record them and share them with you!€ 13 000Shout if from the roof tops! With 3000 euros for distribution the album will get the spread it deserves, and the music will reach far and wide across the planet, and touch all the hearts it is meant for! THANK YOU!€ 16 000At this point, I’m booking a tour, realizing a huge dream of mine! I will come play live in your city and hug you! YIPPIE YAY!The funds will go toward1. Studio time.JonJon has an amazing studio with state-of-the-art equipment. Realizing my visions and recording the arrangements I write requires at least 10 hours in the studio per song… with the result that costs add up quickly. I do cut some corners in quality occasionally and record some backing cello in my home studio to keep the costs down… but ultimately, most of the work needs to be done at JonJon’s to get the quality we’re looking for.2. Editing, post-production, and mix, and mastering.JonJon and I split the editing tasks between us to keep cost down and frankly because I really enjoy having a say in all stages of the production. However, I recognize my limitations as an engineer. Your contribution will ensure the high quality of every stage of the production and mix, and JonJon’s steady guidance. Hallelujah for JonJon’s expertise! (Trust me, it’s worth it.)3. Musicians.Drums, for instance! While JonJon and I record most the instruments, we have our limitations. We have already recorded drums on a few songs with the one and only Mark McCartney, who is SO INSANELY GOOD! Just listen to Let Love Lead the Way. You’ll see what I mean.Recording drums is quite costly, but despite the high price we decided on going with live drums (instead of programmed). Because we have a really strong vision and high standards. Here is a sneak peak from our recording session with Mark.Other instruments that JonJon and I don't play are: Violin (we've got the amazing Victoria Stjerna on a track already!) and wind orchestra.4. Pressing physical CD's & DistributionI want EVERYONE to hear this album! Together, we can spread this music and make sure it reaches the hearts of all the people it was made for! Which is, basically, anyone with feelings and who is willing to tap into the power of their vulnerability. The pressed CD will of course include artwork and a songbook with all the lyrics!For YouI've created a bunch of Perks and gifts to show my gratitude for your support. They include some amazing artwork by Delena Britnell, along with house concerts, handwritten lyrics, the album itself (of course) in different bundles, and much more. Click on a perk to learn more about it! Previous Work2016 I released my first EP, Inside, which was the first step on my mission to express the hidden and emotions that we think are unacceptable, and create music that allows everything to be welcome. You can listen to Inside here: While I am super happy with my last album, I am beyond stoked for the new one. I have evolved as musician, producer and songwriter, and this production is bigger and more professional. I can't wait for you to hear it!Risks and Challenges1. Believing in myselfIt seems like I am in a constant battle with the voice inside of me that tells me I can't, I'm not good enough etc. It feels like I'm pushing against a rubber ceiling above my head, that every so often will break. I burst through and I say: ""HAA! I told you I could do it!"" to my inner choir of critics. When listening to the finished version of Let Love Lead the Way, for example, I burst through, and I feel immensely proud and happy.And then the ceiling is back again and I go back to pushing. I have accepted this resistance as part the process of creating, of breaking new ground. I know I can't get anywhere near to realizing my visions and dreams if I keep playing it safe and only go where I have been before. 2. ReceivingMaking this crowdfunder! Holy cow, it has taken me a year to get it ready and to get myself ready to launch it. Asking for help is super hard, and to do it I need to address all the beliefs that tell me I'm not worthy of receiving it. As you can hear in my music I am fully human and far from sure of my worth, AND I am also determined to not let fear win. Instead, I let love lead the way.",2.0,2,"1 Campaign

<h3>About Me &amp; My Project</h3>
<p>My name is Gráinne Brady and I am an Irish fiddle player and composer from Co. Cavan, based in Glasgow (<a href=""http://www.grainnebradyfiddle.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.grainnebradyfiddle.com</a>). I have been working on the second instalment of my immigration project and am excited to share some newly composed music with you!</p>
<p>My two-part project <i><strong>BEYOND: The Story of an Irish Immigrant</strong></i> explores the social themes associated with the mass immigration of the Irish to Scotland, particularly at the start of the 20th century. The first part of the project culminated in the release of my debut solo album <i>The Road Across the Hills</i> which acts as a soundtrack to the book 'Children of the Dead End', the unofficial autobiography of Donegal poet and writer Patrick MacGill, who emigrated to Scotland in the 1900s.</p>
<p><i>Newcomer</i>, my second album, is inspired by MacGill's second novel 'The Rat-Pit'. Where 'Children of the Dead End' tells the story of Dermod Flynn and his life as a labourer in Scotland, 'The Rat-Pit' runs on the same timeline and chronicles the life of Norah Ryan, Dermod's childhood sweetheart. A young girl of strong faith from Donegal, the story details Norah's struggles with immigration, poverty, isolation and motherhood. Together, both books are uncompromising (and autobiographical) portrayals of the lives of migrant labourers in Scotland at the turn of the last century. At heart of the tale, a bitter-sweet story of unrequited love between young Dermod Flynn and Norah Ryan, and their struggle against gruelling poverty and injustice.</p>
<p>The album will be engineered and co-produced by award-winning musician and composer Mike Vass with a host of wonderful guest musicians; Seonaid Aitken (violin), Sarah Leonard (viola), Su-a Lee (cello), Christine McGinley (French horn), Michael Biggins (piano), Innes White (guitar), Andrew Waite (accordion), Tina Jordan Rees (flute), Steve Forman (percussion/sound effects), Claire Hastings (vocals) and Jack Houston (spoken word/fiddle).</p>
<p>The album will feature 7 instrumental tracks and 3 songs - 2 of which are poems of MacGill's I have put to music and 1 self-penned song (eek!). As part of the album project, I also done a FREE concert series around Glasgow in Nov/Dec 2019.</p>
<p>I am absolutely delighted to have received support from Creative Scotland to part-fund the album but I need your help to make up the rest of the budget. I am also looking for help to fund a big album launch in Glasgow - a big live band is expensive but definitely worth it to showcase the music properly!</p>
<h3>The Budget</h3>
</div><div>
<p>The total budget of <i>Newcomer</i> is £15,948. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Studio time</li>
<li>Engineer/producer (Mike)</li>
<li>Musicians fees and associated expenses (travel etc.)</li>
<li>Mastering (Peter Beckman)</li>
<li>Album artwork (Somhairle MacDonald)</li>
<li>Album Pressing (Birnam)</li>
<li>Admin fee (PRS/MCPS/PPL registering)</li>
<li>Promotion costs (Hannah Innes, also promo photos and videos by Sam Hurt)</li>
<li>Fees for the Glasgow concert series</li>
</ul>
<p>I received a good chunk of the budget from Creative Scotland - £9548 - and with this campaign, some in-kind work and my own funds, I hope to make up the rest of the budget.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Campaign</h3>
<ul>
<li>To adhere to my album budget, I need to raise a further<strong> £2400</strong> </li>
<li> To fund a big album launch (with 10 guest musicians!) in Glasgow I need <strong>£2600</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore I am aiming to raise <strong>£5000</strong> in total. Rewards for your pledges will include signed CDs in advance of the release, tickets for the Glasgow album launch on 5th June 2020, tune commissions, and house concerts.</p>
<p>If you pledge towards this campaign you will be supporting an independent artist. You will be supporting an up-and-coming composer, helping to hone my craft, which I love and am privileged to be able to continue doing.</p>
<p>I was overwhelmed by the support I received to record my debut album <i>The Road Across the Hills</i>, which was released last year to critical acclaim. That album told the story of an Irish male immigrant, and this one will tell the story of an Irish female immigrant.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If I make £2400 from this campaign, I will breathe a sigh of relief that the album budget has been made up! Anything on top of this will go towards the album launch and how much I get depends on the size of band I can hire. So the main risk will be shortage of funds for the launch, but regardless, the launch will happen, albeit with a smaller band!</p>
<p>Another hurdle may be pressing the album - with Brexit, the cost of getting CDs pressed with Birnam may be too high (as they use a European pressing company), therefore I will need to rethink this and see if there are any cheaper UK or Irish pressing companies - hopefully I will be able to go with Birnam though.</p>
<p>Delays with albums are inevitable, with getting everything ready on time, which is why I have set the launch date in June, to avoid any problems. The album will DEFINITELY be done by then!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is David Naylor, i'm a musician and until 2 years ago I had a small business running music groups in hospitals and schools. </p>
<p>Life changed forever when in May 2017 I had a severe brain injury.  I was taken to hospital with an infection which  quickly led to Bacterial Meningitis, Encephalitis and Sepsis.  I was expected to die but after being in a coma for 3 weeks, thanks to the medical team at St Marys Hospital I survived.  However, when I regained consciousness , I didn't know who i was or what my life had been like.</p>
<p>One morning i heard a song in my head and i realised i'd once written it.  The song is called 4000 stars and I thought it was beautiful.   After leaving hospital after 9 weeks and having lost my memory and now with Epilepsy I was terrified.  Then I found more songs I'd written in the past and they gave me a reason to live.  I became determined to somehow record them so I sold almost all my possessions to pay musicians and recording costs.  There are 6 song almost completed but having sold my drum kit I've nothing left to sell so have started this campaign to raise the funds to complete the album.  </p>
<p>5% of funds raised will be divided equally between two charities who are very dear to me --Imperial Healthcare NHS Trust who literally saved my life and Headway (The brain injury charity) who helped me build a new one.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong><u>Breakdown of recording and filming costs.</u></strong> </p>
<p>The plan is to have 10 songs  mixed and mastered by May 2020 and to have at least one video made.  We have 3 songs completed and another 3 which are almost completed but need to be mixed and mastered. </p>
<p>The recordings to be funded by the campaign will be done in 2 stages</p>
<p>Stage 1) Record, mix and master the next two songs ‘Santa Monica’ and ‘Long Time’</p>
<p>Stage 2) Record mix and master the next two songs ‘Razors Edge’ and ‘Nothing Dies’</p>
<p><u>Costs and budget</u></p>
<p><u>Stage 1)</u>) £2700 – studio and engineer for recording / mixing, musicians, video and photograph the session, mastering.</p>
<p><u>Stage 2)</u>) £2700 – studio and engineer for recording / mixing, musicians, video and photograph the session, mastering.</p>
<p>Production for one video £500</p>
<p>Factor in Indie Go Go 5% platform fees £300</p>
<p>5% donation to be divided equally between Imperial Healthcare Trust and Headway £300</p>
<p><b><u>Total Funding target £6500</u></b></p>
<p>To publicize the campaign and recordings we will use social media and reach out to mainstream media, bloggers and podcast hosts.</p>
<p>There is a section below about how we intend to deal with risks and challenges but equally important would be if we were to raise more than the original amount.  If this were to happen then we would look to bringing a publicist and put the rest towards touring and marketing costs. </p>
<p><strong><u>The perks on offer include</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your favorite poems, quotes or song lyrics printed on hand made recycled paper</li>
<li>Drum kit lessons </li>
<li>Sessions using The Demartini Method to help transform challenges and empower you life.</li>
<li>Exclusive downloads - receive the recordings of the songs before they are released publicly.</li>
<li>3 piece house concert, guitarist /singer, cellist and pianist.  </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The greater impact i would love to have by recording and releasing these beautiful songs is to inspire people by showing how we can not only recover from huge adversity but actually see the hidden gifts and use it for our growth and transformation.    </p>
<p>I believe the songs were not meant to die inside me so by helping me record and release them, together we'll be setting them free.    </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Although this the first time I've recorded as a songwriter - in what i call my 'past life' - as a drummer I recorded with world renowned producers Stephen Street, K.K. and Cenzo Townsend.  This means i am aware of the work ethic required for the songs to reach the highest standard.</p>
<p>The recording process over the past 2 years has taught me to listen to those around me before making big decisions but also to believe in, and trust myself.  Since my injury I have embraced working as part of a team more than ever before and the people I am working with have a wealth of music industry experience between them. </p>
<p>By becoming a contributor you will become a valued part of that team. </p>
<p><strong><u>If we don't raise the full amount by the end of the campaign</u></strong>  </p>
<p>Depending on the amount we do raise,  the contributions will go towards the next planned recording session at the end of February and the making of one video. </p>
<p>Then we will use the experience gained to run another Indie Go Go campaign and look at alternative funding sources.   </p>

<strong>Dream Journal</strong>  </h3>
<p>     is a musical project I have been working on for just over one year, featuring 5 original songs I've written and co-produced. The concept of the Dream Journal EP draws inspiration from the multiple definitions of the word. Dreams and aspirations that you may have in life, daydreaming throughout the day, and even literally those dreams you have when sleeping at night. I'm creating music that has a classic edge to it and an overall cinematic vision where each song could be easily heard alongside the emotional climax of a movie. With your help, I hope to bring this project to market. </p>
<h3>The Sound</h3>
<p>This EP will primarily be pop driven with some hints of jazz/soul runs, cinematic intensity, and plenty of neck-hair-rising falsetto. I find music to be our worlds universal language. We can bring communities at adversity to a calm understanding all through this organized and constructed sound called ""music"". My only in passion in life ever has been art. Art can come in a variety of ways and music happens to be the one where I have a gift in. I'd hope this music will fill the moments at night when you can't sleep, when you first wake up, or when you're midday having a personal revelation. </p>
<h3>The Mission</h3>
<p>The official objective is to raise $12,000 for the ever-growing list resources that are needed to get this EP off the ground independently!</p>
<p>Your donations will fund:</p>
<p>* Production, mixing, and mastering of my debut EP<br/>* Recording studio time and space <br/>* Social media promotion and marketing <br/>* Distribution of merchandise <br/>* Videographers for music videos and documenting this journey <br/>* Indiegogo fees :)</p>
<p>Any and all donations are greatly appreciated in helping my passion and career move forward! </p>

The official objective is to raise $12,000 for the ever-growing list resources that are needed to get this EP off the ground independently!
Your donations will fund:
* Production, mixing, and mastering of my debut EP* Recording studio time and space * Social media promotion and marketing * Distribution of merchandise * Videographers for music videos and documenting this journey * Indiegogo fees :)
Any and all donations are greatly appreciated in helping my passion and career move forward!

<h3>Hiya </h3>
<p>I'm Innes Watson, a musician and composer based in Glasgow.</p>
<p>I'm a principal guitar tutor for the Traditional Music dept at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland and fiddle player and founding member of Treacherous Orchestra. And I've been creating and entertaining for over 20 years now. I like to make people laugh and a lot of heart and soul, and hard work goes in to that.</p>

<h3>The reality</h3>
<p>It costs £12,000 to make this album, this is actually what it costs. But there are overheads too and the project is going to need about £16,000. I'm investing my own money too and pulling in precious favours! A basic overview looks like this:</p>
<p>£4400 studio, engineering, mastering</p>
<p>£5000 to pay the musicians fairly</p>
<p>£2000 for manufacture</p>
<p>£3100 for design, promotional materials and PR campaign</p>
<p>£1500 campaign expenses</p>
<h3>How you can support us</h3>
<p>You can support us by buying the album in advance, or any of the fun items we've developed for you: workshops, notation, personal voice memos, coffee with me or my pals Thwaite, Frank, Pierre, or teeth man (see video if you haven't met Thwaite before). There are items I wouldn't do for my best pals on this list so go for it. But most importantly, you'll be among the first to hear the new recording. </p>
<p>If we don't reach the goal of £12,000 I'll prioritise the recording costs and I might be in debt to my amazing musicians until I die. I'm a good dishwasher though. Anyway, I'll make it happen and continue fundraising. If, however, we surpass the total!! Woowee! I can put funds to great use to support rural touring, workshops and additional learning resources for the project and hopefully bring it a bit closer to you.</p>

I'm Innes Watson, a musician and composer based in Glasgow.
I'm a principal guitar tutor for the Traditional Music dept at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland and fiddle player and founding member of Treacherous Orchestra.

What's the Guitar Colloquium?
This all started in 2011 with a New Voices commission from Celtic Connections. The guitar is an amazing instrument: versatile, expressive, capable of leading, supporting and everything in-between. There are two things I'd like to change about guitar music: 1. The lack of repertoire written specifically for guitar, especially in the traditional music world, and 2. The lack of guitar-guitar collaboration. That's what my Guitar Colloquium does: creates and shares new repertoire to challenge and support all ability levels and facilitates guitarists to collaborate and perform together. It's also brilliant music played by brilliant musicians and a good show to boot. 
This album is not just an album. It's the first step in establishing a community of guitarists of all ability levels; developing a more progressive and open-minded approach to guitar playing, composing, teaching and collaboration; and making my dreams come true - ok less important on the grand scale but still, I'm fully invested here. Whether you're a guitarist, a guitar enthusiast, love your music or just want to see more good stuff in the world - we need your support.

<p>For the uninitiated... Tight Lines is a record label based in Leeds ran by a group of friends that for the past 2 and a half years has been shining a light on the city's most interesting and exciting musical artists through a range of live events, video sessions, radio shows, articles and record releases. <strong>It's all about emitting good vibes and supporting community here at Tight Lines.</strong></p>

<p>Another integral part of what we do is build bridges with other cities around the UK, with the aim of creating a more connected musical environment. As well as this, we feel it's our duty to uphold and reinforce Leeds' reputation as a hub for great music and DIY culture; releasing records is without a doubt one of the best ways to do this.</p>

<p>To be honest, it would be very easy and far more financially viable for us to just release this record digitally. The thing is, we think music has more value to it than an uploaded mp3 to a streaming site, and we think you do too.

<h3>The Story of The Steadies - by Earl Pereira</h3>
<p>Hello my name is Earl Pereira, I am the front-man and bassist of The Steadies and have been working solely in the music industry for more than 20 years. Upon finishing 3 years of university I chose to take the chance and pursue my dreams by dedicating my life in becoming a full-time artist. After some rough touring years playing in every seedy bar in Western Canada, I remained focused and determined to build up my band at the time Wide Mouth Mason. By the time I was 22 years old we were on a major label (Warner Music Canada/Atlantic U.S.) and touring with iconic bands like The Rolling Stones and ACDC! Unfortunately, a decade of more downs than ups in the music biz soon followed and I found myself at another crossroads. So in 2011, I chose to follow my heart, continue my life's goal, and build up my own band which we called The Steadies. </p>
<p>We then spent the next 7 years working hard constantly touring across Canada and self-funding our own albums, international tours (China, South Korea and now Europe) and music videos. However, tragically losing our brother and band mate Justin Lee last year almost made me want to give it all up. Instead, I re-focused and worked even harder with drummer Kurtis Schultz performing the most shows The Steadies have played in a single year, while honouring our brother. We also spent a lot of time writing and demoing songs for the next album, which we feel have the potential to touch people all over the world. But we were still missing a key piece and as Juice would always say, ""the universe will provide"" which it did in the form of guitarist Jesse James Clark! I met Jesse through a close mutual friend and his passion, work ethic, talent, positive attitude and genuine excitement to be part of the band has given us a new hope for the future. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Exciting things are already happening like Jesse moving to Saskatoon from Victoria B.C, performing our 1st European Tour this October, recording our next album as soon as we get back, and starting this campaign/exclusive fan club 'Support The Steadies'!</p>
<p>With your help through the funds we raise we will have the ability to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Donate partial proceeds to our Love Revolution non-profit, which funds music-for-youth programs in Saskatchewan in honour of our brother Justin 'Juice' Lee.</li>
<li>Make our best sounding album in order to compete with the best artists in the music industry by hiring top level producers and engineers who have already agreed to work with us, like world-class mix engineer Eric Racy (Damian Marley, Katy Perry).  </li>
<li>Manufacture our album on vinyl for the first time ever, as vinyl pressing is a 10 week process and requires the payment up front.</li>
<li>Effectively market &amp; promote our music worldwide by hiring professional and experienced publicists and radio promoters.</li>
<li>Hire cutting edge video production teams and talented artists for album and merchandise artwork, in order to have world class visuals to match our sound and brand.</li>
</ul>
<p>With your support you will not only be helping us reach our goal of being an established international band, but you will also be receiving exclusive perks such as:</p>
<ul>

</div><p> </p></div>","The Story of The Steadies - by Earl Pereira
Hello my name is Earl Pereira, I am the front-man and bassist of The Steadies and have been working solely in the music industry for more than 20 years. Upon finishing 3 years of university I chose to take the chance and pursue my dreams by dedicating my life in becoming a full-time artist. After some rough touring years playing in every seedy bar in Western Canada, I remained focused and determined to build up my band at the time Wide Mouth Mason. By the time I was 22 years old we were on a major label (Warner Music Canada/Atlantic U.S.) and touring with iconic bands like The Rolling Stones and ACDC! Unfortunately, a decade of more downs than ups in the music biz soon followed and I found myself at another crossroads. So in 2011, I chose to follow my heart, continue my life's goal, and build up my own band which we called The Steadies. 
We then spent the next 7 years working hard constantly touring across Canada and self-funding our own albums, international tours (China, South Korea and now Europe) and music videos. However, tragically losing our brother and band mate Justin Lee last year almost made me want to give it all up. Instead, I re-focused and worked even harder with drummer Kurtis Schultz performing the most shows The Steadies have played in a single year, while honouring our brother. We also spent a lot of time writing and demoing songs for the next album, which we feel have the potential to touch people all over the world. But we were still missing a key piece and as Juice would always say, ""the universe will provide"" which it did in the form of guitarist Jesse James Clark! I met Jesse through a close mutual friend and his passion, work ethic, talent, positive attitude and genuine excitement to be part of the band has given us a new hope for the future. 

What We Need & What You Get
Exciting things are already happening like Jesse moving to Saskatoon from Victoria B.C, performing our 1st European Tour this October, recording our next album as soon as we get back, and starting this campaign/exclusive fan club 'Support The Steadies'!
With your help through the funds we raise we will have the ability to:

Donate partial proceeds to our Love Revolution non-profit, which funds music-for-youth programs in Saskatchewan in honour of our brother Justin 'Juice' Lee.
Make our best sounding album in order to compete with the best artists in the music industry by hiring top level producers and engineers who have already agreed to work with us, like world-class mix engineer Eric Racy (Damian Marley, Katy Perry).  
Manufacture our album on vinyl for the first time ever, as vinyl pressing is a 10 week process and requires the payment up front.
Effectively market & promote our music worldwide by hiring professional and experienced publicists and radio promoters.
Hire cutting edge video production teams and talented artists for album and merchandise artwork, in order to have world class visuals to match our sound and brand.

With your support you will not only be helping us reach our goal of being an established international band, but you will also be receiving exclusive perks such as:

Being the first to receive a copy of the new album in any form you choose (digital, cd, vinyl).
Getting limited edition merchandise as well some special and unique merchandise items.
Having a song of your choice (cover or original) be recorded, personally dedicated, and sent in both a high quality video and mp3 format.
Having The Steadies perform at your home for an acoustic house concert or full electric house party for all of your friends and neighbors! 
Instantly receive a digital playlist of unreleased remixes.


The Impact
We strongly believe that we have the songs, music, work ethic, talent, image, live show and experience to be an established internationally known band. The only thing we are lacking are the funds necessary to sound as best as we possibly can and the resources to properly market and promote ourselves. So with your help and contributions we feel we will be able to take that next jump in reaching our goals and we plan to give right back. As you know, we are all about the positive vibrations, inspiring others, and spreading the message of love that the world needs to hear.

<h3>I'm grateful for the opportunity to be working with amazing people, creating my best work yet! </h3>
<p>We've begun to create the most hi-fi recording of my career to date. It's hard to sit on these recordings because I can't wait to share them with you. But, I've got to raise funds to finish them first!  By investing in this campaign, you'll make it possible for me to complete and release this amazing new collection of songs. </p>
<p>In October 2017, Dominik Schmidt (ROLA Music) produced and recorded four of my new songs. Recording over the course of 2 weeks, he pushed my songwriting, guitar and vocal and performances to compelling new heights. His stellar recording includes performances from Riley Geare (Unknown Mortal Orchestra) &amp; Joey Harmon (Tango Alpha Tango) on drums, Paul Peresa on Keys/Synths, and Jameson Wandling on Bass.</p>
<p>Jeremy Sherrer (Modest Mouse/Dandy Warhols) has already mixed the first single,<i> Damn The Consequences</i>.  In July 2018, I'll be  finishing mixing of the remaining tunes with the amazing LA-based producer/engineer, Rick Parker ( Black Rebel Motorcycle Club). </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>My goal is to raise $3000 on IndieGoGo to complete the mixing/mastering/physical duplication of the EP. All funds raised will go towards the completion of this project. Any residual funds will go towards the creation of a music video /single release to promote the EP. </p>
<p>Campaign perks for contributors include merchandise items, live performances, and sponsorship opportunities.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You'll love these new songs! They're relatable and feature my dark sense of humor in full force. I hope they stir your soul and accompany you on many adventures in life. In 2017, you're contributions made my European release and tour possible. I hope you'll help me take it to the next level this year!</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>I make music I love for other people to listen to . So far, I've invested over $3,000 of my personal funds into the recording and mixing of this EP. I believe the songs are great and the production is fresh and interesting. Producing Hi-Fi recordings is an expensive art form with significant financial risks. However, I've got a generous support network that makes it possible for me to make music all the time. I'm counting on you to help me make the best recordings I can.</p>

We are delving into our Black, Indigenous and Nova Scotian roots to create songs and poems that address and celebrate this largely unacknowledged aspect of Canadian history and culture. We have been rehearsing, performing and recording material in Halifax and Toronto with a plan to release an album entitled ""The Afrometis Constitution"" in the fall of 2018. We have also developed a stage show that we will present in concert halls and at festivals across the country.</p><p>Our goal? To join forces and use powerful artistic forms to tell the untold stories of a segment of the population that has endured and remained strong and productive for hundreds of years, despite immense ongoing adversity and deprivation. When current and future generations hear and feel these songs and stories of struggle, determination, accomplishment and contribution, we believe that a more equitable and enlightened society will be possible.</p><p>A documentary film crew has been following the group for several months to capture their creative process and provide more context to the story they are telling. Key crew members include <strong>David Richler</strong>, <strong>Leslie Schachter</strong>, <strong>Peter Harris</strong> and <strong>Jessica Aldred</strong>. For more info on the documentary and the songs see below.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>A bit of context</strong></h3><p><i>What is Afro-Métis?</i><br/>Coined by Sugar Plum Croxen, Afro-Métis is the term used to describes the genetic mixing between Canadian blacks (particularly from Nova Scotia) and Indigenous peoples that has occurred frequently, beginning over two hundred years ago. The term was created to celebrate this reality.</p><p><br/><i>Why This? Why Now?</i><br/>Many Black people from the Maritimes have a history in Canada that extends over two centuries and has initial periods that include enslavement. ""During the colonial era, Indigenous-African interactions often led to intermarriage."" Unfortunately, this fact has not been well documented and has frequently remained secret, even within families.  </p><p>Today, in a period of trumpery and rising intolerance, it is critical that a true narrative of the journey for both Black and Indigenous peoples across this country be developed and publicized. It is in self-knowledge that pride and strength can be developed and sustained.

</h3></div>","The Afro-Métis Nation: Constitution An album and documentary film The AlbumThe Afro-Métis Nation is George Elliott Clarke, Shelley Hamilton, Sugar Plum Croxen, Russ Kelley and Chris White. We are delving into our Black, Indigenous and Nova Scotian roots to create songs and poems that address and celebrate this largely unacknowledged aspect of Canadian history and culture. We have been rehearsing, performing and recording material in Halifax and Toronto with a plan to release an album entitled ""The Afrometis Constitution"" in the fall of 2018. We have also developed a stage show that we will present in concert halls and at festivals across the country.Our goal? To join forces and use powerful artistic forms to tell the untold stories of a segment of the population that has endured and remained strong and productive for hundreds of years, despite immense ongoing adversity and deprivation. When current and future generations hear and feel these songs and stories of struggle, determination, accomplishment and contribution, we believe that a more equitable and enlightened society will be possible.A documentary film crew has been following the group for several months to capture their creative process and provide more context to the story they are telling. Key crew members include David Richler, Leslie Schachter, Peter Harris and Jessica Aldred. For more info on the documentary and the songs see below. A bit of contextWhat is Afro-Métis?Coined by Sugar Plum Croxen, Afro-Métis is the term used to describes the genetic mixing between Canadian blacks (particularly from Nova Scotia) and Indigenous peoples that has occurred frequently, beginning over two hundred years ago. The term was created to celebrate this reality.Why This? Why Now?Many Black people from the Maritimes have a history in Canada that extends over two centuries and has initial periods that include enslavement. ""During the colonial era, Indigenous-African interactions often led to intermarriage."" Unfortunately, this fact has not been well documented and has frequently remained secret, even within families.  Today, in a period of trumpery and rising intolerance, it is critical that a true narrative of the journey for both Black and Indigenous peoples across this country be developed and publicized. It is in self-knowledge that pride and strength can be developed and sustained. The Afro-Métis Nation has chosen to use music to spark a process of awareness, discovery and discussion, both for themselves and for others. Why?  Because they seek harmony. The Afro-Métis Nation is:George Elliott Clarke – Internationally-celebrated writer, thinker, teacher, performer and conscientious disruptorSugar Plum Croxen – Constantly-touring blues and country performer extraordinaireShelley Hamilton – Multi-award-winning singer, author and actorRuss Kelley – Powerful singer-songwriter and music industry expert Chris White – Folk festival founder, community song leader and radio host(George, Russ, Shelley, Chris, Plums - Toronto, December 2017) The DocumentaryThis film is a profile of a poet and a musical celebration of what it means to claim your identity.After hearing George Elliott Clarke on the radio and experiencing his poetry firsthand at a reading in Montreal in January 2016, Leslie and David set up a meeting with George to discuss the possibility of documenting his tenure as the newly-appointed Parliamentary Poet Laureate.

<p><strong>ALBUM + PROJECT</strong></p>

<p>In honor of the year <i>Come Together</i> was written (1969), the financial goal is set for $19,690.  This just barely covers the expenses of recording the album (studio time, equipment, and recording engineers) and giving honorariums to the musicians involved on the record.  Anything beyond this will go toward future <i>Come Together</i> events, always with the goal of bettering our community.  Whether it be informing children the importance of working together and equality, or promoting environmental sustainability, <i>Come Together</i> events will always voice these valuable things to its audience.</p>

<h3>Come Along! </h3>
<p>Since my first performance in 2008, I’ve collaborated with some incredible musicians and wonderful humans. In the 10 years since that performance I’ve continued writing music and gigging the entire time with a vision of incorporating as many of those amazing musicians, vocalists and creators as possible. </p>
<p>I believe music to be the Universal Language and it is my greatest wish to share my love for humanity and my life experiences through the artistry of music with all of you! </p>
<p>The band is assembled and 6 demo songs have been recorded using a laptop, an audio interface and our personal instruments. Now we’re looking to lock down some time in a studio, cover expenses for engineering, mixing/mastering, online distribution &amp; accompanying artwork and all we need is a little extra push to get us there!</p>

<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Funding Breakdown (8.5K Flexible Goal) <br/> I have broken down our budget in order to effectively balance these various components:<br/>-Our top priority is capturing the music and vocal takes in the studio as thoroughly and efficiently as possible<br/>-Next up is engineering, mixing and mastering costs<br/>-Outside of the core group of musicians lie some incredible instrumentalists I have enlisted to be the icing on the cake. Saxophone along with Trumpet and Violin will add a dynamic and diverse element to the musical palette. </p>

<h3>What You Get! </h3>
<p>Art and music go hand in hand. Check out listed items for a chance to come up on some original artwork and more! I would love to hand deliver as many of the offered perks as possible. On the other hand, in some cases this may not be realistic. *Shipping prices are based on FedEx Office estimated prices for shipping from California to New York and will vary based on location. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are always bumps along the road and the number one challenge is going to be regimenting autonomy. To overcome this obstacle, I have set forth a series of deadlines and check points for us to hit along the way. By staying disciplined and keeping our eye on the prize, the music will come together by spring of 2019 leaving only imagery and final mixing/mastering to be completed. We will be excited to announce an exact release date for the EP by March of 2019! </p>

<h2>BELLE ROSCOE</h2>
<h2>Our journey so far...</h2>
<p>Belle Roscoe is an international love affair between: <br/>Brother &amp; sister, Matt &amp; Julia Gurry from Australia (Vocals, guitars, songwriting and stuff). <br/>Anthony Channer from Somerset, UK (Bass). <br/>Hugo Cottu from London/Paris (Guitar). <br/>Romain Berton from Montpellier, France (Drums). </p>
<p>How we came together... <br/>We, Matt &amp; Julia found vocal harmony even before we could talk!  Then from singing at school, to entertaining friends and around the Christmas table with cousins we soon became passionate song writers and dreamed of a life travelling the world making music. We recorded our first self-titled album in Melbourne, Australia in 2009. <br/> <br/>Our first album's success took us to France where we were signed to a label and played to over 150,000 people in one year, including sell out shows in Paris, huge festivals in the South West (la Bayonne, Rip Curl Festival), we officially closed The Cannes Film Festival and performed the pre-match entertainment for a Premier League football match in Lens, France to over 40,000 people! <br/><br/>In 2011-2014, we lived in Paris and were signed &amp; managed - until our label absconded to Switzerland... with our money! So in 2013, we self-raised money (before crowd funding even existed) through family, friends, and fans and by working 100 different part-time cash jobs in Paris! The second album ""Boom Boom"" was recorded between Belgium &amp; Malta &amp; Paris (with Belgium's best producer, Luuk Cox - Girls in Hawaii, ‪Stromae, &amp; MLCD) and this was officially released in 2014. </p>
<p>On the back of this album, we have toured around the world, playing &amp; writing with some of  the best musicians in France, Belgium, Germany, England, USA &amp; Cuba! In 2016-2017 we played over 160 shows worldwide. At the beginning of 2017, we landed in Cuba! The mission was to rest and write for 6 weeks. We were exhausted after touring. Little by little the Cubans taught us how to love music for the right reasons again. We performed with all the best bands in Havana, drunk rum, recorded, and found perspective &amp; inspiration to start writing our best ever music - the music we've wanted to write and record since we discovered timeless songs like ""Give me Shelter"" (Rolling Stones) &amp; ""Down by the River"" (Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young). <br/><br/>Post Cuba, we have set up a studio in Covent Garden, London and we finally found our band! After years of searching, we found a band of people we have been dreaming of - a combination of talented, likeminded international musicians as dedicated to Belle Roscoe as us and as determined to play the best music possible. This year we played the Isle of Wight Festival and had sold out shows throughout Germany! We have now been writing, demoing and testing our new songs live for the past 12 months! We are now ready to go to record tracks in Tennessee. </p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED FROM YOU GUYS &amp; WHAT YOU GET FROM BELLE ROSCOE! </strong></p>
<p>By supporting this crowd funding campaign you will be contributing to the recording of our best music to date. As an independent band, label free - we control our music 100%. We own 100% of our music including publishing. 100% our sound. 100% our song-writing. It is the most liberated we have ever felt. BUT... To stay independent comes at a big cost - both financially and time wise. So we need your support to assist us to fund this next recording.<br/><br/>We are not asking for a donation, or for you to invest - we are asking that you trust in our music, our time, our dedication and our talent - and simply buy it in advance! By purchasing a perk (or two!) you can share the journey with us - Literally share the journey. You can come and watch us record in Nashville, you can have us play at your next event, you can buy a signed guitar, you can even enjoy our recording anecdotes face to face over dinner in London! There are some absolutely unique experiences to be had! But if nothing else...

Our journey so far...
Belle Roscoe is an international love affair between: Brother & sister, Matt & Julia Gurry from Australia (Vocals, guitars, songwriting and stuff). Anthony Channer from Somerset, UK (Bass). Hugo Cottu from London/Paris (Guitar). Romain Berton from Montpellier, France (Drums). 
How we came together... We, Matt & Julia found vocal harmony even before we could talk!  Then from singing at school, to entertaining friends and around the Christmas table with cousins we soon became passionate song writers and dreamed of a life travelling the world making music. We recorded our first self-titled album in Melbourne, Australia in 2009.  Our first album's success took us to France where we were signed to a label and played to over 150,000 people in one year, including sell out shows in Paris, huge festivals in the South West (la Bayonne, Rip Curl Festival), we officially closed The Cannes Film Festival and performed the pre-match entertainment for a Premier League football match in Lens, France to over 40,000 people! In 2011-2014, we lived in Paris and were signed & managed - until our label absconded to Switzerland... with our money! So in 2013, we self-raised money (before crowd funding even existed) through family, friends, and fans and by working 100 different part-time cash jobs in Paris! The second album ""Boom Boom"" was recorded between Belgium & Malta & Paris (with Belgium's best producer, Luuk Cox - Girls in Hawaii, ‪Stromae, & MLCD) and this was officially released in 2014. 
On the back of this album, we have toured around the world, playing & writing with some of  the best musicians in France, Belgium, Germany, England, USA & Cuba! In 2016-2017 we played over 160 shows worldwide. At the beginning of 2017, we landed in Cuba! The mission was to rest and write for 6 weeks. We were exhausted after touring. Little by little the Cubans taught us how to love music for the right reasons again. We performed with all the best bands in Havana, drunk rum, recorded, and found perspective & inspiration to start writing our best ever music - the music we've wanted to write and record since we discovered timeless songs like ""Give me Shelter"" (Rolling Stones) & ""Down by the River"" (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young). Post Cuba, we have set up a studio in Covent Garden, London and we finally found our band! After years of searching, we found a band of people we have been dreaming of - a combination of talented, likeminded international musicians as dedicated to Belle Roscoe as us and as determined to play the best music possible. This year we played the Isle of Wight Festival and had sold out shows throughout Germany! We have now been writing, demoing and testing our new songs live for the past 12 months! We are now ready to go to record tracks in Tennessee. 
WHAT WE NEED FROM YOU GUYS & WHAT YOU GET FROM BELLE ROSCOE! 
By supporting this crowd funding campaign you will be contributing to the recording of our best music to date. As an independent band, label free - we control our music 100%. We own 100% of our music including publishing. 100% our sound. 100% our song-writing. It is the most liberated we have ever felt. BUT... To stay independent comes at a big cost - both financially and time wise. So we need your support to assist us to fund this next recording.We are not asking for a donation, or for you to invest - we are asking that you trust in our music, our time, our dedication and our talent - and simply buy it in advance! By purchasing a perk (or two!) you can share the journey with us - Literally share the journey. You can come and watch us record in Nashville, you can have us play at your next event, you can buy a signed guitar, you can even enjoy our recording anecdotes face to face over dinner in London! There are some absolutely unique experiences to be had! But if nothing else... Grab yourself a copy of the forthcoming album (CD or Vinyl or both?) - we'll be thrilled to sign it for you! So please, have a look at our perks.FUNDING OBJECTIVEWe are raising £20,000 with this crowd funding campaign.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Husband-and-wife cabaret duo and songwriting team David Alpher (pianist/composer) and Jennie Litt (singer/lyricist--me!)  have been making music together since our very first date, back in 1999.  Countless shows and nearly 60 songs later, we are ready to return to the studio to to record a follow-up to our well-reviewed 2014 CD, <i>Two Apples</i>.</p>
<p>As a lyricist, I'm influenced by the great satirists of the 1960s, Tom Lehrer and Allan Sherman; cabaret giants Bertolt Brecht, Jacques Brel, Noël Coward, Flanders &amp; Swann, and Dave Frishberg; and the American musical theater.  David, who divides his musical life between chamber music, art song, and cabaret, draws on his rich musical background in our songs, with a particular emphasis on jazz/blues, melody-driven ballads, and lushly imagined pastiche. He is particularly inspired in his cabaret writing by Leonard Bernstein, Vernon Duke, Bill Evans, George Gershwin, and Richard Rodgers.  Working in a variety of genres — children's music, comic novelty, jazz/blues, neo-Tin Pan Alley, pop, protest, and satire — we've amassed an eclectic oeuvre of tightly-crafted, piano-driven, stand-alone cabaret songs that the critics have hailed as ""enchanting,"" ""brilliant,"" ""ingenious,"" ""life-affirming,"" and ""masterful on many levels.""  We have performed our songs (or had them performed) not only at virtually every club in New York City, but on three continents.  </p>
<p><i>Songs For Sapiosexuals</i> will comprise 16-18 never-before-recorded songs that have proved the most popular with our live audiences over the past four years.  Among others: the global warming song Tom Lehrer would have written were he still writing songs; a new holiday standard for New Year's; love songs for new lives and old loves; our take on that Nashville classic, the highway song; a whiskey-soaked torch song or two; feel-good family favorites; the unflinching record of a death; and a symphonic exploration of the things that make us sing in the first place.  </p>
<p>We have booked time at Lone Pine Road Studios (<a href=""http://lonepineroad.com)%C2%A0in"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://lonepineroad.com</a>) in Kingston, NY, with its fantastic Yamaha concert grand.  Lone Pine Road's Eli Winograd will produce, and we have engaged some top-notch Hudson Valley and NYC musical artists (who also happen to be friends) to flesh out the ensemble.  We have a photo session booked, a designer in the wings, our distribution package lined up, and childcare arranged for our daughter.  There is nothing standing in our way except $10,000.</p>
<p>That is where you can help.</p>

<p>IndieGogo fees and perk expenses: $465</p>
<p>Miscellaneous: $257.50</p>
<p>To show our gratitude for your support, we will not only send you a hot-off-the-press copy of <i>Songs for Sapiosexuals</i>, we have a number of other enticements up our sleeves: homemade baked goods, a studio visit to experience the CD being made in real time, a house concert in your own living room, even a free weekend at our 6-bedroom 1840 Hudson Valley farmhouse on the Kripplebush Creek!</p>
<p>We will invest every penny you pledge in the production and marketing of this CD, no matter whether we fall short of, reach, or exceed our $10,000 goal.  Any amount you pledge, no matter how small, makes a difference--and underscores our determination to deliver the very best work we can to you, our friends, family, listeners, and (dare I say?) fans.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>David and I are self-representing artists.  We have no manager or agent booking gigs or tours for us, no publicist getting the word out about our shows or recordings, no press agent assuring reviews in prominent publications, no radio agent securing us airplay.  Most often, we gig for the door, and whatever extra we can drum up in post-show CD sales.  Every few months, we receive a negligible payout ($10 or less) from CDBaby, iTunes, Spotify, SheetMusicPlus, or ASCAP.  There is no question that, for us, making art is artistically rewarding; but financially rewarding it is not.</p>
<p>Furthermore, no one wants to make art in a vacuum.  I think the best analogy for many musical artists in this post-music-industry age is that we have become like the minstrels of old: the sole providers of live music for a small community.  Our community is you.  </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Kaala &amp; Substation have joined forces and are working hard to connect independent bands here in Seattle with the thousands of bands active in Japan's underground scene for bicoastal tours of both regions! We're calling it an ""exchange program"" for the time being, and we think it's gonna be awesome.</p>
<p>For our inaugural run, we've paired Seattle's doomstars <a href=""https://summonedbygiants.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Summoned By Giants</a> with the filthy sludge of Tokyo's <a href=""https://floatersjapan.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Floaters</a> . Tickets are already bought and dates booked, but this costs thousands of dollars out of pocket, and any contributions to help offset the costs would be much appreciated!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have a bunch of perks in mind such as exclusive, one time only merch that we will be selling on this tour only. But lucky you, we are also giving it out as rewards for donating towards the tour. Things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Japanese Album Release<ul><li>CD, Vinyl or Tape</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Limited run Tour Shirt</li>
<li>Stickers that are for this tour only</li>
<li>A Camping with our grumpiest bandmate.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you probably know, tours for independent bands can be very expensive. This is even more so when attempting to do an international tour. Your contributions will help with the following expenses: </p>
<ul>
<li>Airfare</li>
<li>Gear (Symbols, Guitars, cords)</li>
<li>Gas</li>
<li>Places to sleep</li>

<h3> My name is Pete Cater and I play drums.</h3>
<p>Having first picked up a pair of sticks in ve childhood I have now been playing for more than fifty years.</p>
<p>Born into a musical family I was fortunate to have great influences and access to inspiration from my first days. Such was the power of this inspiration that I made it my goal very early on to aim as high as possible, seeking a level of attainment akin to that of the legendary drummers in my father's record collection. </p>
<p>Not blessed with a formal music education or an entree into the upper echelons of the music industry it was very much left up to me to make my own way when it came time to become a professional player. This I have done and I believe that you can do it too. </p>
<p>I first began performing at a professional level in 1977, took my first private students in 1982 and have been teaching at university/college level since 1994.</p>
<p>My career as a performing musician has always and continues to encompass a broad range of musical genres, however it is as a jazz musician, with particular emphasis on big band playing that I have forged an international reputation. In 2015 I was voted in the world's top 5 jazz drummers by Rhythm magazine, the only non-USA player to be nominated in that year's poll.</p>
<p>I am proud to be affiliated with the British Drum Company, the  Zildjian company, Remo drum heads, and Vater drumsticks.</p>
<p>My lifelong quest for attainment in my field, having been inspired in very early childhood by legends like Joe Morello, Buddy Rich and Louie Bellson has led me to scrutinise the techniques of drumming very closely. I have spent much of the last three decades analysing and deconstructing the approaches of all manner of drummers across the entire musical spectrum.</p>
<p>However, not content merely to replicate what has gone before I have fused the traditions of the past masters with contemporary concepts and developments both with regard to technical facility, musical application, and with particular emphasis on creativity and improvisation. </p>
<p>Decades of research and development have led me to a point where I feel I have a logical, easily understood  and fully formed approach to the instrument, and that I have the tools to simplify and revolutionise drumming for players of all ability levels.</p>
<p>My work as an educator in music colleges, masterclasses, clinics, drum camps and with private students has proved that a great many students feel overwhelmed by the amount of information available and the required level of knowledge. My approach simplifies and strips away unnecessary baggage and will help the student understand how everything comes back to a very small number of key parameters that are at the root of everything all drummers do. </p>
<p>Having issued the DVD, Pete Cater On Drums in 2018 I'm now going to follow that up with a book, which will enable me to go into far greater detail and depth with a couple of key concepts.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Just like my previous crowdfunding campaign this is once again a way of obtaining the finished product at a discounted, advance order price.</p>
<p>Just as previously there will be additional perks on offer, although my goal amount for this project is significantly lower. </p>
<p>Every contribution matters and counts; whether you just wpuld like to preorder a copy of the book or splash out and have my big band do a private concert for you and your friends. There will be an acknowledgement page in the book where every contributior will be credited.</p>
<p>Even if you are not a drummer there are t shirts and big band CDs on offer, and as this is a printed product there will be a page where every contribution is credited.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Having been teaching drums since the 1980s I have observed how a great many of the accepted approaches to learning, with particular emphasis on repeating hand patterns at a constant subdivision,  don't represent a shrewd investment of time and bear little resemblance to what's required when it's time to play music with with other people.</p>
<p>My articulation concept is the cornerstone of this publication, and as its name suggests presents an alternative approch. An approach in which the player's rhythmic dexterity is expanded in a direction that few players of our instrument seem to have thought of. Having experimented in my own playing over a number of years I believe that this, and other concepts for inclusion are genuinely groundbreaking. </p>
<p>Seemingly forever there has been this constant 'chops vs groove' non-argument in drumming circles and a key element of this method book is how the two can go hand in hand.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>It's not always possible to make financial contributions, as a lifelong professional musician I am all too aware of the unpredictability of cash flow, but anything you can do to spread the word, social media, word of mouth or whatever, is sincerely appreciated and hugely valuable.</p>
