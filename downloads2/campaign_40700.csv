<p>We all know that oceans are rising, acidifying, and brimming with trash.  The situation is desperate.  It overwhelms most of us, but who is doing something about it?  Little ones.</p>

<p>David’s is concerned about the impact of increasing human consumption and increasing human population size (what he calls “<strong>Human Impact</strong>”). He has spent the last 9 months researching Human Impacts, not only on the residents of South African communities, but also on South African landscapes and wildlife. He’s identified around 100 Human Impact sub-topics and 100 locations around South Africa demonstrating them. In March 2013 he’ll commence a 3 month nationwide journey visiting and writing about these locations and issues.</p>
<p>He’ll publicise human rights, women’s rights and environmental issues affected by Human Impacts, publicise the work of well-known organisations (such as Marie Stopes and the Endangered Wildlife Trust) but also highlight small community based organisations working with children, HIV and other relevant topics. <strong>TooMuchTooMany </strong>will cover topics from the housing crisis to contraception, biodiversity to healthcare and immigration to endangered species.</p>
<p>David wants to look at Human Impacts differently and conclude with systemic solutions to South Africa’s problems which do not treat human rights, women’s rights and environmental issues as separate subjects, but rather find solutions which address all these concerns together.</p>

<h3>Send Brittany to Costa Rica's Sloth Sanctuary!</h3>
Our pal Brittany was accepted into Costa Rica's Sloth Sanctuary volunteer program awhile back. She booked her flight, took the vacation time and was all set to go ... until she got laid off. Now the money she set aside for volunteering is needed to support herself until she lands another gig. We want to help Brit cover her volunteer costs so she can follow through on the volunteer experience she signed up for.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Sloth Sanctuary of Costa Rica has been rehabilitating orphaned and injured sloths for more than 20 years. In addition, the sanctuary's outreach program teaches local people and tourists that baby sloths are bad pet choices and raises awareness about poaching and habitat destruction. It has since become a place and international hub for sloth research.</div>

<h3>What Brittany Needs</h3>
<p>Brittany has taken care of her travel expenses to Costa Rica, however, each volunteer pays  $65/day during the volunteer's two week stay. We're looking to cover the cost of:</p>
<ul>
<li>All meals are included: Breakfast is a do it yourself meal. Lunch and Dinner are cooked by a Sanctuary Staff member.</li>
<li>Board: A room (dorm style) will be provided with an in room bathroom and a shower. We have some double rooms and rooms that hold up to 6-8  people)</li>
<li>One towel is provided for each volunteer</li>
<li>Bedding and one pillow is also provided per volunteer</li>
<li>Laundry gets done once a week (Wednesday) free of charge.</li>

<h3>Why You Should Help Brittany</h3>
<p>There are hundreds and thousands of people in the US without jobs, so, why should you help Brittany? If you're a friend of Brittany's, well you probably don't need much convincing. Brittany has a track record of altruism—she was down in NOLA after Katrina to help with clean-up and returned again to Mississippi after the oil spill, while on the arts side, she's volunteered time with the Seattle International and Sundance Film Festivals. This isn't some Costa Rican vacation you're funding; Brittany will be down there doing the work most of us wouldn't give up the time for.<br/><br/><br/>Sometimes, you need the universe to give you a high-five. That's what Brit needs. Or in this case, a two-toed salute.</p>

Bees aren’t cheap!  Project costs are as follows:$1000 for 8 Nucs of local bees$3100 for Hive supplies—including hive boxes, frames, foundations and more$150 for queen rearing supplies  My plan to sell products derived from their wax and any surplus honey will offset future capital outlays and allow me to keep my fees reasonable.  This production requires the following equipment:$100 for Solar Wax Melter$550 for a professional grade Extractor$450 for Indiegogo fees  Total $5350  Thanks for considering funding my bee project.  It truly means the world to me.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><em>Why We Need Your Help</em></h2>
<blockquote>
<em><b>""Twenty years ago there were Dolphins as far as the eye could see, and Tuna everywhere. Today these monster factory ships have made Costa Rica's ocean into an almost barren sea. There are very few Tuna with the Dolphins. Scared as hell.""  ~ Fred Maschmeier ~ Drake Bay, Costa Rica Sport Fisherman</b></em><br/>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Costa Rica's dolphins, whales, sea turtles and other marine flora and fauna are being decimated at alarming rates due to rampant commericIal fishing including long lines, gill nets, shrimp trawling and tuna boats.</strong><br/></p>
<p>The Osa
Peninsula, on the South Pacific side of Costa Rica is known by National
Geographic as the most biologically intense place on Earth. The waters off the
Osa Peninsula are a virtual marine wonderland, housing over twenty-five species
of dolphins and whales that live here year round or migrate through and also
hosts four of the world’s eight species of sea turtles. </p>
<p>In fact,
Costa Rica enjoys one of the most biologically diverse ocean ecosystems in the
world. This is mainly because the heart of a vast habitat known as the Costa
Rican Thermal Convection Dome, named for its proximity to this country, lies
here. Shallow warm waters lie on top of low-oxygen cold water, creating the
perfect ecosystem for a vast variety of marine life. The dome off the coast of
Costa Rica is the only one in the world that is constant. Such conditions
provide the Costa Rican Pacific waters with a very unique scheme of biological
richness. Whales, dolphins, tuna, marlin, manta rays, sea turtles, sailfish and
more, congregate in this area taking advantage of this year-round thermal dome
of ecologically rich waters.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/172917/files/20131103124920-collage.jpg?1383511760"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em;""/><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>All this rich biodiversity is found here on
the Osa Peninsula, but yet, the area is almost entirely unprotected, except for
small areas around the national parks. Commercial fishing techniques such as
long lining, shrimping, gill netting and tuna fishing are wreaking havoc on
this delicate and biologically diverse area and its marine inhabitants, and if urgent
and drastic actions are not taken immediately, the world will lose this treasure
forever.</p>
<p><b>The quickest and easiest way to protect
this precious and pristine area before it is to late is to create a Marine
Protected Area (MPA)… and we need your help to do it.</b></p>
<blockquote>""One of the few commitments made by world leaders at the
World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in 2002 was to address the current

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px;"">Humpback Whales</span><p></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">The Pacific side of Costa
Rica is the vital breeding and birthing grounds of Humpback Whales (Megaptera
novaeangliae) that migrate from both North and South America. <b>It is the only
place in the world where Humpback Whales come from two different hemispheres to
have their babies and breed.</b> Humpbacks have been sighted in every month of the
year, giving us the longest season of Humpbacks in the world. For these reasons
alone, the area should be protected but yet they are met by long lines, gill
nets and shrimp boats, putting them in danger of entanglement and noise
pollution. <b>This is no way to treat an endangered species.</b></span></p>
<b></b><p></p>

<p></p>
<h4>Dolphins and Other Whales</h4>
<p></p>
<p>These biologically
intense Costa Rican Pacific waters host more than twenty-six species of marine
mammals from the Cetacean Order (dolphins and whales). Some of the species with
a bigger presence in the area are the Pantropical Spotted Dolphins (Stenella
attenuata), the Bottlenose Dolphins (Tursiops Truncatus) and the Spinner Dolphins
(Stenella Longirostris). The Spinner Dolphins found here are a sub-species of
Spinner Dolphins found only off the Pacific Coast of Costa Rica in a 90 mile
wide band of ocean. They are hence called Costa Rica Spinner Dolphins, our very
own species. But yet they are netted, killed, maimed and stressed out relentlessly by the tuna boats, mostly
foreign fleets.</p>
<p>The dolphins are
distributed in a heterogeneous manner, from smaller groups with two or three
individuals in coastal waters, to pods of thousands of individuals in deeper oceanic
waters. Also Roughtooth Dolphins, Risso’s Dolphins, Pseudo Orcas, Pilot Whales,
Orcas, Bryde’s Whales, Fin Whales and Sei Whales are commonly seen in these
waters. For a full list of the dolphins and whales in the area, please visit our website, <b><a href=""http://www.mpaforosa.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MPA for OSA</a>.</b></p>

<p></p>
<h4>Sea Turtles</h4>
<p></p>
<p>Four out of the eight sea
turtles species in the world are found in the Pacific side of Costa Rica. UICN
finds these four sea turtle species to be in a critical state or in danger of
extinction. The sea turtles’ threats are mainly over-exploitation of eggs and
shells, the changing and destruction of sea turtles’ natural habitats,
pollution, and the incidental capture of turtles by commercial and traditional
fishing boats. <b>Through the data collected on our research tours, we have
discovered that in the last four years, the population of the Olive Ridley Sea
turtle has decreased an alarming 79%.</b></p>
<p></p>

<h2><i>The Threats</i></h2>
<h3><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; line-height: 24px;"">Commercial Shrimp Boats</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Commercial
shrimp boats drag their nets along the ocean floor virtually killing and “clear
cutting” everything in their path, including sea turtles, rays, eels, coral,
plant life and thousands of small fish. These small fish are an intricate part
of the food chain but are killed before they can grow to reproduce and become
food for animals and humans alike, breaking the natural food chain. We already
know our turtle population is in grave danger and our coral systems are dead or
dying. Once the ocean floor is stripped in this way, it does not grow back. The
area that the Humpback Whales (and divers) love so much called Paraiso, is being
destroyed by the shrimp boats as are the main feeding areas for our local
dolphins. <b>In fact, for every gallon of shrimp that is harvested, over five
gallons of other sea life is killed.</b></p>
<b></b><p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/174219/files/20131104062710-1148939_536864883052408_1982621163_n.jpg?1383575230"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em;""/><br/></p>
<p><strong style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; line-height: 24px;"">Long Lines and Nets</strong><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Another
major problem in the area is the long line fishing boats. Long lines are spread
out, sometimes for miles and miles, and are baited every several feet with a
hook and a piece of fish. The sea turtles, sharks, manta rays, billfish and
many other forms of marine life often will bite the bait and get hooked on the
line. If the line is too far below for the turtles to reach the surface, they
drown. The ones who don’t drown and are hooked on the long line at the surface
are often cut open by the fishermen in order to look for sea turtle eggs or
otherwise killed in the process. <b>The long lines are also harmful to dolphins
and whales that cannot see them and get severely cut by the lines and hooks, or
worse, get entangled in them and drown.</b></p>
<b></b><p></p>
<p><b></b></p>

<p>Twice we have seen
small humpbacks with long lines and rope wrapped around their bodies. We have
frequently recorded long lines spread out in the areas frequented by the
dolphins, whales and turtles. Often long line gear and nets that are tangled or
unusable is left floating in the water so it continues to kill and maim even
after the fishermen are done with it. Any captain traveling these waters has
seen dead or even live turtles, rays and dolphins stuck in freely floating long
line gear and most recently, a dead baby Humpback Whale washed up onto the
shores of Corcovado National Park, the victim of a net left in the water as seen in the photo below. </p>

<p></p>
<h4><strong>Tuna Boats</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>Large
commercial tuna boats also kill and maim thousands of dolphins each year. They
use helicopters to find the dolphins and when they do, they radio the tuna boat
which then puts several speed boats in the water to round up to dolphins and
set a net around them to catch the tuna swimming underneath. It is now believed
that more than 2000 Spinner dolphins per year or more are being killed by the
tuna industry off the Osa Peninsula alone. The dolphins are not able to sustain
their populations when they are killed off at this rate. Our subspecies of
Spinner Dolphin, the “Costa Rican Spinner Dolphin” has been severely depleted.
Where there used to be thousands and thousands of them, there are now hundreds. <b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">If we continue to let them be killed, there will be no more Costa Rican Spinner Dolphins.</b></p>

<h2><i>Our Goal</i></h2>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>To promote and support, with a solid scientific base, the creation of a “Multiple Use Marine Protected Area” off the coast of the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica and cooperate with all involved parties to achieve its effective protection and enforcement.</b></span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The
main objective of the AMUM “Multiple Use Marine Protected Area” management
category is the protection and conservation of the comprised marine areas and
to assure sustainable use of their resources and habitats. Private, commercial,
scientific and sport fishing, as well as tourism development and marine
transportation activities, will be executed within a management plan and
supervision.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The
area that we have determined as needing protecting is located in the south of
the Pacific Ocean of Costa Rica. A “Multiple Use Marine Protected Area” AMUM,
is proposed from and including Marino Ballena National Park and Caño Island to
Punta Sirena.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/174268/files/20131104065237-1378177_560673757338187_2127997210_n.jpg?1383576757"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><em>This area comprises already protected areas (Corcovado National Park, Isla del Caño, Marino Ballena National Park and Terraba-Sierpe Mangroves); ecosystems of great relevance and unique biological characteristics. The importance of these ecosystems and their immediate and future threats, calls for real protection, coordination and control, both of their natural resources and the activities carried out within their boundaries.</em></p>
<p>In 2004, the Costa Rican government issued a decree to protect 25% of the nation’s Exclusive Economic Zone. In support of this objective, and to assist in determining the management and protection needs of the extensive marine life found here, MPA for OSA's ambitious project will provide direct technical input, using their extensive scientific database, to create a Protected Marine Area (MPA) and to improve networking for marine biodiversity research at local, national and international levels. This will be accomplished with a master plan that will determine the management and protection needs of the Mesoamerican Marine Corridor’s biodiversity and natural resources.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The conservation of the Osa Peninsula
marine life is a complex process that requires commitment, participation and
coordination from all possible institutions, individuals and organizations. </span><a href=""http://www.mpaforosa.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""line-height: 1.45em;"" target=""_blank""><b>MPA for OSA</b></a><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> seeks

<p>From 1999 to 2008,
Delfin Amor Eco Lodge, a small hotel nestled in the heart of Drake Bay, closed
in 2008 to focus on marine activities exclusively, in conjunction with the Vida
Marina Foundation, collected sighting data on their dolphin and whale
educational research tours. Delfin Amor’s tours, now run by <a href=""http://www.divinedolphin.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Divine Dolphin</a>, are conducted year
round, with a higher percentage of tours in the “dry season,” December through
April.</p>
<p>During
our research tours, we counted and document the location of turtles, dead and
alive, as well as commercial fishing boats and long lines. Also documented were
the dolphins’ and whales’ group size, ages, and also their travel and feeding
patterns and behaviors. Digital photos and video were also taken to further
document and identify the dolphins, whales, turtles and commercial fishing
activities. With the data analysis we have carried out, we have documented an
alarming 79% decrease in the Olive Ridley Sea Turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea)
population during the last several years.</p>

<h2><strong>Budgets and Funding</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Our
previous research and data collection was funded by profits from Delfin Amor
Eco Lodge, which now does not exist, and donations to our foundation, Vida
Marina. The foundation’s biggest funder lost their fortune in the Bernie Madoff
scandal, just when we were about to receive a grant of $250,000 and as a
result, our foundation could no longer stay afloat. We are now in need of researchers,
marine biologists, research equipment and materials in order to continue the
collection of data for written scientific reports both supporting the MPA
initiative and once established, maintaining it and enforcing laws and
regulations within.</p>

""Twenty years ago there were Dolphins as far as the eye could see, and Tuna everywhere. Today these monster factory ships have made Costa Rica's ocean into an almost barren sea. There are very few Tuna with the Dolphins. Scared as hell.""  ~ Fred Maschmeier ~ Drake Bay, Costa Rica Sport Fisherman


Costa Rica's dolphins, whales, sea turtles and other marine flora and fauna are being decimated at alarming rates due to rampant commericIal fishing including long lines, gill nets, shrimp trawling and tuna boats.
The Osa
Peninsula, on the South Pacific side of Costa Rica is known by National
Geographic as the most biologically intense place on Earth. The waters off the
Osa Peninsula are a virtual marine wonderland, housing over twenty-five species
of dolphins and whales that live here year round or migrate through and also
hosts four of the world’s eight species of sea turtles. 
In fact,
Costa Rica enjoys one of the most biologically diverse ocean ecosystems in the
world. This is mainly because the heart of a vast habitat known as the Costa
Rican Thermal Convection Dome, named for its proximity to this country, lies
here. Shallow warm waters lie on top of low-oxygen cold water, creating the
perfect ecosystem for a vast variety of marine life. The dome off the coast of
Costa Rica is the only one in the world that is constant. Such conditions
provide the Costa Rican Pacific waters with a very unique scheme of biological
richness. Whales, dolphins, tuna, marlin, manta rays, sea turtles, sailfish and
more, congregate in this area taking advantage of this year-round thermal dome
of ecologically rich waters.



All this rich biodiversity is found here on
the Osa Peninsula, but yet, the area is almost entirely unprotected, except for
small areas around the national parks. Commercial fishing techniques such as
long lining, shrimping, gill netting and tuna fishing are wreaking havoc on
this delicate and biologically diverse area and its marine inhabitants, and if urgent
and drastic actions are not taken immediately, the world will lose this treasure
forever.
The quickest and easiest way to protect
this precious and pristine area before it is to late is to create a Marine
Protected Area (MPA)… and we need your help to do it.
""One of the few commitments made by world leaders at the
World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in 2002 was to address the current
inadequate protection of our oceans and coasts by creating representative networks of MPAs by 2012. More recently, in 2010 governments gathered in
Japan at the UN Convention on Biodiversity meeting agreed to a
biodiversity rescue plan that includes marine protected areas covering 10% of
our oceans by 2020."" ~ World Wildlife Federation

Humpback Whales
The Pacific side of Costa
Rica is the vital breeding and birthing grounds of Humpback Whales (Megaptera
novaeangliae) that migrate from both North and South America. It is the only
place in the world where Humpback Whales come from two different hemispheres to
have their babies and breed. Humpbacks have been sighted in every month of the
year, giving us the longest season of Humpbacks in the world. For these reasons
alone, the area should be protected but yet they are met by long lines, gill
nets and shrimp boats, putting them in danger of entanglement and noise
pollution. This is no way to treat an endangered species.




Dolphins and Other Whales

These biologically
intense Costa Rican Pacific waters host more than twenty-six species of marine
mammals from the Cetacean Order (dolphins and whales). Some of the species with
a bigger presence in the area are the Pantropical Spotted Dolphins (Stenella
attenuata), the Bottlenose Dolphins (Tursiops Truncatus) and the Spinner Dolphins
(Stenella Longirostris). The Spinner Dolphins found here are a sub-species of
Spinner Dolphins found only off the Pacific Coast of Costa Rica in a 90 mile
wide band of ocean. They are hence called Costa Rica Spinner Dolphins, our very
own species. But yet they are netted, killed, maimed and stressed out relentlessly by the tuna boats, mostly
foreign fleets.
The dolphins are
distributed in a heterogeneous manner, from smaller groups with two or three
individuals in coastal waters, to pods of thousands of individuals in deeper oceanic
waters. Also Roughtooth Dolphins, Risso’s Dolphins, Pseudo Orcas, Pilot Whales,
Orcas, Bryde’s Whales, Fin Whales and Sei Whales are commonly seen in these
waters. For a full list of the dolphins and whales in the area, please visit our website, MPA for OSA.




Sea Turtles

Four out of the eight sea
turtles species in the world are found in the Pacific side of Costa Rica. UICN
finds these four sea turtle species to be in a critical state or in danger of
extinction. The sea turtles’ threats are mainly over-exploitation of eggs and
shells, the changing and destruction of sea turtles’ natural habitats,
pollution, and the incidental capture of turtles by commercial and traditional
fishing boats. Through the data collected on our research tours, we have
discovered that in the last four years, the population of the Olive Ridley Sea
turtle has decreased an alarming 79%.


The Threats
Commercial Shrimp Boats

Commercial
shrimp boats drag their nets along the ocean floor virtually killing and “clear
cutting” everything in their path, including sea turtles, rays, eels, coral,
plant life and thousands of small fish. These small fish are an intricate part
of the food chain but are killed before they can grow to reproduce and become
food for animals and humans alike, breaking the natural food chain. We already
know our turtle population is in grave danger and our coral systems are dead or
dying. Once the ocean floor is stripped in this way, it does not grow back. The
area that the Humpback Whales (and divers) love so much called Paraiso, is being
destroyed by the shrimp boats as are the main feeding areas for our local
dolphins. In fact, for every gallon of shrimp that is harvested, over five
gallons of other sea life is killed.


Long Lines and Nets

Another
major problem in the area is the long line fishing boats. Long lines are spread
out, sometimes for miles and miles, and are baited every several feet with a
hook and a piece of fish. The sea turtles, sharks, manta rays, billfish and
many other forms of marine life often will bite the bait and get hooked on the
line. If the line is too far below for the turtles to reach the surface, they
drown. The ones who don’t drown and are hooked on the long line at the surface
are often cut open by the fishermen in order to look for sea turtle eggs or
otherwise killed in the process. The long lines are also harmful to dolphins
and whales that cannot see them and get severely cut by the lines and hooks, or
worse, get entangled in them and drown.



A baby humpback whale with a line embedded in its skin


Twice we have seen
small humpbacks with long lines and rope wrapped around their bodies. We have
frequently recorded long lines spread out in the areas frequented by the
dolphins, whales and turtles. Often long line gear and nets that are tangled or
unusable is left floating in the water so it continues to kill and maim even
after the fishermen are done with it. Any captain traveling these waters has
seen dead or even live turtles, rays and dolphins stuck in freely floating long
line gear and most recently, a dead baby Humpback Whale washed up onto the
shores of Corcovado National Park, the victim of a net left in the water as seen in the photo below. 



A recent study published in the Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology and conducted by the Department of Biodiversity, Earth and Environmental Science, Drexel University and the Programa Restauración de Tortugas Marinas (Pretoma) called Impact of Costa Rican longline fishery on its bycatch of sharks, stingrays, bony fish and olive ridley turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea) states:


""Marine protected areas and/or time area closures are needed to reduce the impact of the Costa Rican longline fishery on sea turtles and sharks.""
Randall Arauz, president of the Marine Turtle Restoration Project (PRETOMA) and one of the authors of the above study states:

“You don’t have to be a fishery biologist to know that if you’re killing 80 percent of the animals that haven’t reproduced yet, you’re … on a collision course towards extinction.""


A long line fisherman cuts up a manta ray that was captured on their line.

We can see rays, sharks and possibly dolphins in the carnage from the long line boats.



Tuna Boats

Large
commercial tuna boats also kill and maim thousands of dolphins each year. They
use helicopters to find the dolphins and when they do, they radio the tuna boat
which then puts several speed boats in the water to round up to dolphins and
set a net around them to catch the tuna swimming underneath. It is now believed
that more than 2000 Spinner dolphins per year or more are being killed by the
tuna industry off the Osa Peninsula alone. The dolphins are not able to sustain
their populations when they are killed off at this rate. Our subspecies of
Spinner Dolphin, the “Costa Rican Spinner Dolphin” has been severely depleted.
Where there used to be thousands and thousands of them, there are now hundreds. If we continue to let them be killed, there will be no more Costa Rican Spinner Dolphins.

Our Goal
To promote and support, with a solid scientific base, the creation of a “Multiple Use Marine Protected Area” off the coast of the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica and cooperate with all involved parties to achieve its effective protection and enforcement.

The
main objective of the AMUM “Multiple Use Marine Protected Area” management
category is the protection and conservation of the comprised marine areas and
to assure sustainable use of their resources and habitats. Private, commercial,
scientific and sport fishing, as well as tourism development and marine
transportation activities, will be executed within a management plan and
supervision.
The
area that we have determined as needing protecting is located in the south of
the Pacific Ocean of Costa Rica. A “Multiple Use Marine Protected Area” AMUM,
is proposed from and including Marino Ballena National Park and Caño Island to
Punta Sirena.


This area comprises already protected areas (Corcovado National Park, Isla del Caño, Marino Ballena National Park and Terraba-Sierpe Mangroves); ecosystems of great relevance and unique biological characteristics. The importance of these ecosystems and their immediate and future threats, calls for real protection, coordination and control, both of their natural resources and the activities carried out within their boundaries.
In 2004, the Costa Rican government issued a decree to protect 25% of the nation’s Exclusive Economic Zone. In support of this objective, and to assist in determining the management and protection needs of the extensive marine life found here, MPA for OSA's ambitious project will provide direct technical input, using their extensive scientific database, to create a Protected Marine Area (MPA) and to improve networking for marine biodiversity research at local, national and international levels. This will be accomplished with a master plan that will determine the management and protection needs of the Mesoamerican Marine Corridor’s biodiversity and natural resources.

The conservation of the Osa Peninsula
marine life is a complex process that requires commitment, participation and
coordination from all possible institutions, individuals and organizations. MPA for OSA seeks
cooperative efforts to support our initiative from partners and involved
organizations, the private sector and government.

Budgets and Funding

Our
previous research and data collection was funded by profits from Delfin Amor
Eco Lodge, which now does not exist, and donations to our foundation, Vida
Marina. The foundation’s biggest funder lost their fortune in the Bernie Madoff
scandal, just when we were about to receive a grant of $250,000 and as a

marine biologists, research equipment and materials in order to continue the
collection of data for written scientific reports both supporting the MPA
initiative and once established, maintaining it and enforcing laws and
regulations within.


Recording data on our research tours

Phase I of
our project includes continuing data collection, including Photo ID and video
evidence, and comparing it with our previous data to generate reports and
graphs on the current state of the ocean off the Osa Peninsula. We will gather
signatures for an online Petition in support of the MPA and coordinate meetings
with all concerned parties in the communities affected by the borders of the
proposed MPA and the local government for input and strategy and completing an
Implementation and Management Plan for the Marine Protected Area.
Earth Island Institute has graciously donated a high tech hydrophone and digital
recording system to us, but we need much more to carry out our research and to
take the steps necessary towards creating the MPA. 
All equipment purchased in Phase I will be
used for all other phases and beyond. If all funds are not received, we will

History of Noyes Mountain
Historically the land was owned by the Stevens family and included a through road north from Norway to Greenwood (from the Upton Brothers Road to the Hayes Road). In 1869 Ethel Stevens sold the land to Isaac Noyes.

Isaac Noyes became interested in the site’s pegmatitic outcroppings in the late 1880′s. In 1892 the ledge was opened for the first time and became a mecca for scientists and collectors, offering one of the most complex mineralized pegmatites in Maine. Mineral operations on the mountain were opened by Isaac’s 6th cousin George Lorenzo (“Shavey”) Noyes and Tim Heath about 1894. Tourmaline was first recorded from the locale about 1904. In 1917, Harvard College bought a 1 acre mine site and a 100-year mineral rights lease on 60 acres. Over the years the dark green tourmaline found at this location has become known as “Harvard Green.""
The granite pegmatites Noyes collected were largely preserved and passed into the possession of the Harvard Museum. In the summer of 1923 active quarrying was undertaken by the Harvard Mineralogical Department under the supervision of Harvard University student Kenneth K. Landes for Landes' dissertation, Paragenesis of the Granitic Pegmatites of Central Maine (American Mineralogist, 1925, v. 10, p. 355-411). Loren B. Merrill of Paris and Arthur Valley undertook most of the actual excavation for Landes at the site.
The land, which has been the subject of images by artists and photographers since settlement as the backdrop for Lake Pennesseewassee, is also coveted for its wildlife habitat, rare plants, mineral and cultural significance.
Currently Frank Perham owns the 1-acre Harvard quarry, which remains open to the public. Mineral rights on the western portion will retire in 2016. 



Why This Land is Worth Protecting 

The View of the Mountain Looking north up the reach of Norway Lake, two mountains shape the horizon and frame the distant view of Old Speck Mountain. The western mountain is Patch Mountain (elev. 1,565'), and the eastern steeper mountain is Noyes Mountain (elev. 1,500'). By day our community and its visitors have enjoyed a verdant mountain backdrop to the lake, and by night humans and wildlife have benefitted from dark hills uninterrupted by development.
That could all change quickly. The Land Trust has seized this as our first and best opportunity to protect that signature view that has inspired artists and photographers since settlement in the late 1700s.
The View from the Mountain The other view to protect, that is less widely known, is the stunning panorama south and west from Noyes. Most of us have not seen Norway Lake, or North Pond, or the nearby McIntire Ridge, or Patch Mountain from this beautiful vantage point. Easily travelled twitch trails will lead hikers, skiers and snowshoers from a maintained landing to the viewpoint and summit beyond.


The Land To the east of the summit, the land descends gradually to a saddle plateau towards Rock O Dundee. A path is a vestige of the old road that crossed to Greenwood City. Now a working forest, the land was historically managed as a mix of agricultural fields, pastures and woodlands, as is evidenced by stone walls in the deep woods, and in historic photographs and paintings. Twitch trails are well-maintained and will make for wonderful hiking and backcountry skiing.
Wildlife Habitat and Rare Plants This site's diverse ecology supports several rare plants and provides excellent wildlife habitat as it lies in an undeveloped block of 2,691 acres. It also includes nearly 1,000 feet of stream that supports a riparian habitat and, given its size and altitude, is an important forested filter for the Norway Lake watershed.
Mineral and Cultural Significance The parcel is the location of the respected Harvard Quarry (a separately held acre owned by Frank Perham open to the public) that was opened by Shavey Noyes and Tim Heath in the 1890s. The mineralogy of this mountain, like other deposits in this region, played an important cultural and industrial role in the history of western Maine.
Management The Trust will manage Noyes Mountain In much the same way that we have managed our other Preserves. We will maintain existing trails and potentially create additional multi-use trails if consistent with our overall resource conservation goals.
We would allow hunting on site. We would keep the parcel in tree growth tax basis and would continue to manage the forest responsibly. Forest management revenue is important for the Trust’s own sustainability.

living in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.  With degrees in chemistry and
chemical engineering, I have 29 years of experience as a process engineer in
the food and renewable energy industries.  You can see my LinkedIn profile at <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/dazietlow/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>www.linkedin.com/in/dazietlow/</u></a>.</span><br/></p>
<p>For three decades, I have been
working to solve the Achilles' heel of renewable energy.  We get it
when and where it is available, which is often not when and where it is needed.  We can't control when and where we get it and there isn't a feasible way of storing and transporting it, so we can have it when and where we need it. I have an invention that solves this problem for electricity from wind and
solar power.</p>
<p>My campaign is to fund the final
patent application for my invention.  Filing this application is a
significant milestone. Although the application does not guarantee a patent and
the patent process will take additional time and money, filing will give me
more freedom to disclose my invention to investors and potential partners to
get their help developing and implementing it.  Based on the input of the patent professionals I am
working with, I am confident that my patent application will result in a patent
that will allow me to commercialize this invention, solving a major problem limiting the use of renewable energy, making it more usable for all of us, the US and the world.</p><p></p><h4>The Problem</h4><p>Each year, the United States consumes one billion tons of fossil fuels and produces more than two billion tons of greenhouse gases and pollution to generate electricity.  But we generate less than 4% of our electricity from wind and solar power.  No wonder three-quarters of Americans think increasing renewable energy is a priority!</p><p>However, the amount of electricity from wind and solar power is limited because wind and solar power are often not available when and where needed.  By storing wind and solar power in a form that is transportable and readily usable, my invention would make electricity from wind and solar power available when and where needed.</p><h4>The Solution</h4><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Like the carbon cycle (see the video for an explanation), my invention takes naturally </span>occurring<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> materials and uses wind or solar power to produce clean, safe fuel that can be stored, transported and used to generate electricity when and where needed.  Burning the fuel to generate electricity, produces the original naturally occurring</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> materials which are recycled again and again. My invention converts wind and solar power into electricity when and where needed.</span><br/></p><p>The general idea of using renewable energy to produce a renewable fuel where the materials in the process get recycled is not new.  Hydrogen has been proposed for decades.  There are good reasons why its not being used yet.  Researchers are working on a number of other chemical systems for accomplishing the goal of renewable carbon neutral fuels.</p><p>My invention is different from these in several ways.  First, the chemical system used is novel. Neither I nor the patent researcher I have hired have found a patent or other technical literature that discloses the chemical system of my invention.  Second, the chemical system of my invention, unlike batteries and most energy storage systems, has more than enough energy to make transporting it long distances feasible.  Third, most of the infrastructure needed to implement my invention already exists, which greatly increases the chances it will ultimately be practically and economically feasible. Fourth, my invention doesn't require water, which is increasingly scarce and valuable.  I believe my invention actually has the best chance of any technology existing or currently proposed of making wind and solar power more available sources of electricity with zero carbon emissions at a reasonable price.</p><p><b>One note</b>, I don't disclose the materials used in my invention because that is the key to my invention and it's not patented yet.  Six months after filing, my invention will become public, regardless of whether the patent office grants a patent or not.  If you are interested in the details, I offer a perk disclosing the details or you can wait until mid-September and get a copy free or cheap from the United States Patent and Trademark Office.</p><h4>The Benefit</h4><p>In the nearer term, my invention could capture wind power that is currently lost because it has no place to go.  Currently, lost generated wind power in the United States is equal to the electricity consumed by the state of Rhode Island.</p><p>In the long term, my invention could significantly increase the installed capacity of electricity from wind and solar power and get the maximum benefit from them.  We would have a way of getting renewable energy from locations with large wind or solar potential and limited transmission capacity, such as North Dakota, to places with high demand, like Chicago.  Renewable energy from wind and solar power would be available most anywhere even when the wind isn't blowing and the sun isn't shining.</p><p><b>A Note to Those Living Outside the United States</b></p><p></p><p>Although my video is primarily talks about the United States, I am also filing an international PCT patent application as part of my <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">campaign.  Since launching my crowd funding campaign, I have determined that the potential impact of my invention outside the United </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">States may be even greater than that inside, particularly in countries with limited or expensive fossil fuels and biomass.  Your </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">contributions are also needed and appreciated.</span></p><p></p><h4>Have I Ever Done Anything Like This Before?</h4><p>I have conceived and developed a number of inventions, some patentable, some not.  Probably, my most significant invention to date, other than the one of this campaign, was a practical breakthrough in industrial microwave heating technology.  Since it is patented, you can read about it <a href=""https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US5869817.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p><p>This invention was a breakthrough because it took a type of microwave heater, that was very powerful and efficient, but so inflexible it had limited practical applications, and modified it to retain all the power and efficiency, but also to have tremendous flexibility.  This innovation created many new potential applications, including heating materials in ways that are not possible any other way.  Others more qualified than I had tried to do the same thing without success.  I find it interesting that I was able to see the potential for, conceive and successfully develop this invention, even though I wasn’t an expert in microwave heating, either by training or previous experience.</p><p>I believe my current invention is similar.  Although it is more in line with my training as a chemical engineer, most of my professional experience is not in the renewable energy industry.  In this case, I think being at arm’s length actually gives me an advantage because I am not as influenced by the prevailing ideas and thinking of the industry.  Breakthroughs are often the result of a different perspective.</p><h4>What I Need</h4><p></p><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">My campaign goal is $30,000</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">, of which $21,000 (70%) is for preparing and filing the patent application.

living in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.  With degrees in chemistry and
chemical engineering, I have 29 years of experience as a process engineer in
the food and renewable energy industries.  You can see my LinkedIn profile at www.linkedin.com/in/dazietlow/.
For three decades, I have been
working to solve the Achilles' heel of renewable energy.  We get it
when and where it is available, which is often not when and where it is needed.  We can't control when and where we get it and there isn't a feasible way of storing and transporting it, so we can have it when and where we need it. I have an invention that solves this problem for electricity from wind and
solar power.
My campaign is to fund the final
patent application for my invention.  Filing this application is a
significant milestone. Although the application does not guarantee a patent and
the patent process will take additional time and money, filing will give me
more freedom to disclose my invention to investors and potential partners to
get their help developing and implementing it.  Based on the input of the patent professionals I am
working with, I am confident that my patent application will result in a patent
that will allow me to commercialize this invention, solving a major problem limiting the use of renewable energy, making it more usable for all of us, the US and the world.The ProblemEach year, the United States consumes one billion tons of fossil fuels and produces more than two billion tons of greenhouse gases and pollution to generate electricity.  But we generate less than 4% of our electricity from wind and solar power.  No wonder three-quarters of Americans think increasing renewable energy is a priority!However, the amount of electricity from wind and solar power is limited because wind and solar power are often not available when and where needed.  By storing wind and solar power in a form that is transportable and readily usable, my invention would make electricity from wind and solar power available when and where needed.The SolutionLike the carbon cycle (see the video for an explanation), my invention takes naturally occurring materials and uses wind or solar power to produce clean, safe fuel that can be stored, transported and used to generate electricity when and where needed.  Burning the fuel to generate electricity, produces the original naturally occurring materials which are recycled again and again. My invention converts wind and solar power into electricity when and where needed.The general idea of using renewable energy to produce a renewable fuel where the materials in the process get recycled is not new.  Hydrogen has been proposed for decades.  There are good reasons why its not being used yet.  Researchers are working on a number of other chemical systems for accomplishing the goal of renewable carbon neutral fuels.My invention is different from these in several ways.  First, the chemical system used is novel. Neither I nor the patent researcher I have hired have found a patent or other technical literature that discloses the chemical system of my invention.  Second, the chemical system of my invention, unlike batteries and most energy storage systems, has more than enough energy to make transporting it long distances feasible.  Third, most of the infrastructure needed to implement my invention already exists, which greatly increases the chances it will ultimately be practically and economically feasible. Fourth, my invention doesn't require water, which is increasingly scarce and valuable.  I believe my invention actually has the best chance of any technology existing or currently proposed of making wind and solar power more available sources of electricity with zero carbon emissions at a reasonable price.One note, I don't disclose the materials used in my invention because that is the key to my invention and it's not patented yet.  Six months after filing, my invention will become public, regardless of whether the patent office grants a patent or not.  If you are interested in the details, I offer a perk disclosing the details or you can wait until mid-September and get a copy free or cheap from the United States Patent and Trademark Office.The BenefitIn the nearer term, my invention could capture wind power that is currently lost because it has no place to go.  Currently, lost generated wind power in the United States is equal to the electricity consumed by the state of Rhode Island.In the long term, my invention could significantly increase the installed capacity of electricity from wind and solar power and get the maximum benefit from them.  We would have a way of getting renewable energy from locations with large wind or solar potential and limited transmission capacity, such as North Dakota, to places with high demand, like Chicago.  Renewable energy from wind and solar power would be available most anywhere even when the wind isn't blowing and the sun isn't shining.A Note to Those Living Outside the United StatesAlthough my video is primarily talks about the United States, I am also filing an international PCT patent application as part of my campaign.  Since launching my crowd funding campaign, I have determined that the potential impact of my invention outside the United States may be even greater than that inside, particularly in countries with limited or expensive fossil fuels and biomass.  Your contributions are also needed and appreciated.Have I Ever Done Anything Like This Before?I have conceived and developed a number of inventions, some patentable, some not.  Probably, my most significant invention to date, other than the one of this campaign, was a practical breakthrough in industrial microwave heating technology.  Since it is patented, you can read about it here.This invention was a breakthrough because it took a type of microwave heater, that was very powerful and efficient, but so inflexible it had limited practical applications, and modified it to retain all the power and efficiency, but also to have tremendous flexibility.  This innovation created many new potential applications, including heating materials in ways that are not possible any other way.  Others more qualified than I had tried to do the same thing without success.  I find it interesting that I was able to see the potential for, conceive and successfully develop this invention, even though I wasn’t an expert in microwave heating, either by training or previous experience.I believe my current invention is similar.  Although it is more in line with my training as a chemical engineer, most of my professional experience is not in the renewable energy industry.  In this case, I think being at arm’s length actually gives me an advantage because I am not as influenced by the prevailing ideas and thinking of the industry.  Breakthroughs are often the result of a different perspective.What I NeedMy campaign goal is $30,000, of which $21,000 (70%) is for preparing and filing the patent application.

<p><b>Rivenstone Ranch Dog Rescue</b></p>
<p><b>We
need YOUR help to save strays in our area!</b></p>
<p></p><p>Rivenstone Ranch is a private ranch in the White 
		Mountains of Northeast Arizona. We have been taking in strays in this 
		remote area for 5 years. To the ranchers here, stray dogs are the same 
		as coyotes and they are shot on sight. Most of the dogs we've taken in 
		were in bad shape when they got here. Some had wounds from fights with 
		coyotes, other strays, or from being shot. </p>
<p>The dogs in our care come from a wide area, and 
		many were dumped, and arrived here pregnant. We take them in, 
		rehabilitate them until they are healthy and friendly, then try to find 
		new homes for them. Most of the dogs are medium to large dogs and are 
		not as easily re-homed as small ones.</p>
<p><b>Building
for the future of these dogs </b></p>
<p>This campaign will help us to raise
enough money to build a new housing area for all of our dogs, pay for vet costs
(spay, neuter, and shots), food, and re-homing costs. By completing this
campaign to house all of the dogs on site at Rivenstone Ranch we can:</p><ul>
<li>Pay for the materials
and construction of good quality housing that will last for years to come,
where it is comfortable and warm for all of the dogs. (Costs will be kept to a
minimum by using volunteers for labor and as much indigenous material as
possible. (eg. Local stone, local clay for stucco, etc.)</li>
<li>Help with cost for
the spaying and neutering of all the dogs as well as shots and any other veterinary needs<br/>
</li>
<li>Purchase food in bulk
at a lower cost per pound<span></span>
</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Pay for additional
marketing for re-homing and education for new dog owners

</li>
</ul><p>In short, by completing this project,
you will not only be helping towards a new building, but ensuring we can carry
on the work of saving strays by allowing us to keep caring for these dogs. <span> <br/></span></p><p><span>For a long time now we've cared for these dogs 
		with our own money, but 
		changes in the economy and our real world jobs, have made this no longer feasible.  
		Food and vet bills are a constant, and new dogs continue to show up. Any 
		help you can give us is gratefully received and 
		will go a long way towards helping us improve our facilities so that we 
		can keep these lost animals safe until they find new forever-homes.<br/></span></p>
<p><b>Why
we're running this campaign</b></p>
<p></p><p>At this moment we are sheltering 25 dogs.  
		Unfortunately, we've been told that someone else in the area that has 
		also taken in strays over the last few years is relocating soon, and we will be 
		taking in his 16 dogs as well. Although initially we had no intention of becoming a dog shelter, we love dogs and 
		can not 
		allow them to starve or be shot like vermin by the ranchers. </p>
<p>The crisis we are facing now is made worse 
		because the existing animal shelters in this area are also completely 
		overwhelmed by stray and abandoned dogs. These shelters try to be no-kill, but 
		simply do not have the space or funds to keep all the dogs until they 
		are adopted.  There are no other animal shelters within 25 miles of 
		our ranch 
		and most of the public facilities in this county euthanize after only a 
		day or two.  </p>
<p>There is 
		not enough funding available from government agencies for the need in 
		this area, so we are seeking help from dog/animal lovers to keep the 
		dogs we have safe and healthy and to build a shelter that can continue 
		to be of service for years to come. </p><span></span>

water collection invention that provides free, clean water at
less than $100 per installation whether at a shack or a mansion.


The Problem



Rain falls
on your roof as free clean fresh water.
It starts on a costly and totally unnecessary journey before it
gets back to where it started a couple of meters from your tap!
How far did the water in your glass travel?
How much did
you pay for it?
How much
energy was used? 
In California 5 billion Kw/hours per year to pump water to 38 million people.
In South Africa 18 billion Kw/hours per year to pump water to 30 million people.
What's the figure for your state or country ?
20 % of all energy generated in the USA & Europe is used to pump water.
Can we halt climate change by saving this energy? Yes by installing Blue-Change.
Can ordinary folk do it? Yes by installing Blue-Change for themselves in a couple of hours.
The Solution



Simple and
easy to install. (DIY)
Low cost.
Collects
water efficiently.
Does not
collect dust and detritus like conventional gutters.
Easily
cleaned by pulling the bottom lip down and clearing the obstruction.
It can
collect rainwater from formal and informal structures.
It can be
installed very quickly.
Blue-Change may be installed for own private home use without restriction.
Send this picture that shows how Blue-Change works to friends and family.
Blue Change brings fresh clean water a couple of
meters to your tap.

Blue Change
does this for less than a hundred dollars in readily available materials and
everyone can install the system from
a picture and simple instructions.



With Blue-Change

10 mm's of rain on a 20
sq meter shanty roof means that for 10 whole days there is no fetching and
carrying of water.
10 mm's of rain on a 200
sq meter roof means 10 days of free water
or 100 days of emergency backup. 
Water in the tank is better than money in the bank.
The Plan
With your
help we can get this patented invention to every community in the world and
create jobs overnight.
We need people in every country to help themselves and show others how to have free clean water.
Blue-Change will offer
further selling, distribution and manufacturing rights. 
These
rights/opportunities shall be offered to donors of this campaign first.
Only a living human being shall own any right in Blue-Change.


What do you get when you donate and install?
   a free source of water. 
  independence from utilities.
 control over the quality of your water.
  electricity used to pump water uphill by the utility is saved
 You do not have to waste your life carrying water.
  You earn money doing the installations full, or part-time.
  your donation back in the first months from water saved.

Where will your money go?
To spread the word until everyone knows how to collect their own free clean water.
To secure provisional intellectual protection in all countries.

Challenges


The major challenge facing blue change is to convince people that the solution  to the worlds water crisis and  global warming is so simple and easy to implement.

I ask only that you trust your own common sense and judgement in this regard.  
Ask your friends and family to share and support the Blue-Change opportunity.

<h3>Rebuild America, one cob home at a time!</h3>
<p> </p>
<h3>Buildings constructed using earthen materials, such as cob, will stand strong for hundreds of years, are relatively affordable, energy efficient, sustainable, and I can't imagine anything more lovely than a family, hand sculpting a new home together from the clay and sand beneath their feet! We wish to fund the professional construction of our own cob home by experienced cob home builders so that we can share this experience with our community and pass on these skills to our surrounding, tornado-stricken towns. Among many things, this is what we came here to do. Read our story: <a href=""http://www.indygo.info"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""A Bus Conversion and Beyond!!!"">www.indygo.info</a>
</h3>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>My name is Lori Moore and my husdand's name is Jeremy Moore. In our past lives, we lived on the northside of Chicago, Illinois. That was 4 years ago. We now live in bus in the woods, and we love it. Our two little girls love it too. We purchased the bus on Craigslist with  our tax return for $4000 and converted the interior into a comfortable living space using recycled and repurposed materials and furniture. That project is covered in detail at <a href=""http://www.indygo.info"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.indygo.info .</a></p>
<p>We are aiming to change the global landscape, for the better, starting with our own homestead. We are certainly not pioneers of this effort - not in the last century, nor the last few millenia, for that matter. Our ""advanced"" technocratic society has created devastating effects on the green lands of this Earth, and on the daily lives of the families and individuals dwelling upon it. By revisiting all-but-forgotten methods of home construction, using earthen materials already available on one's home place, we may begin to build structures that blend into the landscape, as well as do much less harm to the environment surrounding it. Reeducating the communities on home planning  and development can bring much relief to those hit by tornadoes and free many others from the mortgages and that bind them.</p>
<p>Virtually all parents want to give their children a comfortable home, safety and security. This is what we want but it is hard to say if we are really providing these things when ""family time"" must be scheduled into weekends of working overtime, and when our houses are tacked together using toxic products that damage the environment in a monumental fashion. It doesn't have to be this way. It is possible to  pass down something of actual value to the next generation like the skills and the means to fabricate a house, using the materials found on (or nearby) the home site to make a warm, lovely home that will lasts for many generations.</p>
We do not intend to live in the bus forever. We wish to become profficient at contructing cob homes so that we can help others do the same. If we can show others how they can design and build a unique, warm, strong, durable, well insulated home without a mortgage, we can begin to free a society. When a family sculpts a home together, they share family time together. People can choose, if they wish, to develop a homestead with their very own two hands. A ""hard day of work"" becomes a labor of love while spending a lifetime cultivating a space that will be eagerly inherited by the next generation. We can begin looking at our family lands as something so much more valuable than just an investment to be flipped for a profit. A homestead that is cultivated with love will give love in return. The fruits and vegetable grown in a space of love like this will be more nutritious than any food available anywhere else. We feel very strongly about our vision, and the direction of our lives. We know that this is what we are supposed to be doing as a couple and as parents.
<p>With a little extra support, we can complete the first cob construction projects on our own land, beginning this Autumn of 2012 and with projected completion in the summer of 2013. We can share this experience with our friends and neighbors and upon completion, we can offer our new skills with the surrounding communities. Help directed towards us can come in many forms, of course. We are currently collecting bricks, blocks, cobblestone, gravel, steel drums (see: rocket mass heaters), 55 gallon plastic drums, railroad ties, oak timber, solid oak doors, terra cotta (broken or unbroken) rebinforcing steel bars) cement mix, wooden cedar shingles, wheel barrows, garden trailers, used window panes and denim jeans! </p>
<p>It is important to note that a home does not consist of a shelter alone, and that developing an environment of permaculture to surround ones home will have lasting benefits on the health and happiness of those living within a home created in this manner.</p>
<p>Creating positive change in the world begins within one individual, within oneself. Improving the health and well being of a society begins within the family's home.</p>

<h3><strong>When an international fishing fleet finds its way to the last untouched ocean on Earth – the Ross Sea in Antarctica - humanity is faced with a great challenge: do we fish the last ocean or do we protect it?</strong></h3>
<p>For the past seven years New Zealand filmmaker Peter Young has been part of a team working on a campaign to protect the Ross Sea, widely regarded as the most pristine marine ecosystem on Earth. A key tool in that campaign is his self-funded feature documentary <em>The Last Ocean.</em> Peter is taking the film on a road trip in the US, and then onto Europe, where he hopes to inspire audiences to support full protection of the Ross Sea.</p>
<p><strong>The next few weeks are crucial</strong>. In July of this year, 25 Antarctic nations will gather in Bremerhaven, Germany, to decide whether or not to establish a large marine protected area in the Ross Sea. The lead up to Bremerhaven is our big opportunity to make a difference.</p>
<p>Speaking at a special screening of the <em>The Last Ocean</em> in Washington DC last month, <strong>US Secretary of State, John Kerry</strong> said he hoped that the film would inspire people to be responsible stewards of ""this fragile planet"".</p>
<p>Supporting this Last Ocean road trip is an opportunity to do just that. </p>

<h3><strong>What is the Last Ocean Road Trip?</strong></h3>
<p>The Last Ocean road trip is a campaign tour to promote the protection of the Ross Sea. Peter Young is attending film screenings at the festivals listed below to give Q&amp;A‘s and generate media interest. Between screenings the team will lobby supermarkets to stop selling Antarctic toothfish caught in the Ross Sea and ask consumers to stop eating it. (Antarctic toothfish is marketed as Chilean sea bass throughout North America).  Then, if our stretch goal is reached, Peter will head to Germany to hold special screenings ahead of the talks in Bremerhaven.</p>
<h3><strong>What we need...</strong></h3>
<p><em><strong>Update:  </strong><strong>Halfway into this campaign, we have reassessed our goals.</strong> At the very least we will get Peter to as many of the US festival screenings as possible, and if funding allows we will continue on to Bremerhaven, holding as many screenings as we can in Europe. </em></p>
<p><strong>Basic funding: we reach - $26,750 </strong>Peter attends film screenings in the US to give Q&amp;A’s, generate media interest and raise awareness on a 25-day campaigining road trip from Newport, Rhode Island to San Francisco.</p>
<p><strong>Stretch goal: we reach - $39,650 </strong>Peter travels to Germany for screenings. If successful we will have screenings in Hamburg, Berlin and Bremerhaven, as well as special screenings in London. An additional $ 13,000 is required for this European leg.<strong><strong>                                                                                      </strong>     </strong><strong> </strong></p>

<h3><strong>Why is USA important?</strong></h3>
<p>Both US &amp; NZ are key players in negotiations for a Ross Sea Marine Protected Area (MPA). They are jointly proposing a large MPA in the Ross Sea at a special meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) this July in Germany. While the proposed MPA covers a considerable area, it allows for commercial fishing in the Ross Sea. We need both Governments to know that while this proposal is an important first step it does not go far enough and offer the Ross Sea the full protection it deserves.</p>
<p>Antarctic toothfish is currently caught in the Ross Sea by 7 fishing nations. Much of the catch ends up in the US where it is marketed as Chilean Sea bass. The US is home to several key seafood industry players including Monterey Bay Aquarium which publish the Seafood Watch Guide, and supermarkets chains Wholefoods, Kroger &amp; Safeway.</p>
<p><em>The Last Ocean</em> has already played at several film festivals in the US and it resonates well with American audiences. Bringing the film director to screenings attracts greater audiences, creates more impact and draws more media attention to the film and issue. </p>

<h3>Motorcycles for Mongolian Park Rangers</h3>
<p> In August, 2017, ten intrepid and committed volunteers will join together in Ulaanbataar, Mongolia, with the goal of riding ten Yamaha AG200 motorcycles 1,200 miles to Otgontenger Strictly Protected Area, Mongolia and delivering these much needed machines to the park rangers there who patrol vast expanses of primitive protected lands. These pristine areas are under constant threat from poachers, ninja mining, commercial development, and ever increasing numbers of tourists.

PARAGUAY.</b><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">
<p><b>We create the paradise<br/></b>The island where you can live, live as you be or how you want to be.<br/>You, the one hand as a holiday and recreation, or even –can use as your
retirement home- if you want to.</p>
<p><b>None (pure) holiday island!<br/></b>Although people need time, to be in a limited island to find peace and
inner balance too. But here everyone should and can be constantly as he wants to be, or is.
At the same time these “ISLAND
 OF THE LIFE” should meet
as a foundation of the environment in which people, animals and plants can
living together.</p>
<p><b>How it began:<br/></b>The “island of the life” in Paraguay is part of a small
mountain in which you may use for holidays and recreation, or even as a
retirement home. But it is not a pure holiday resort. Although people need
islands to gain inner peace and balance it is exactly here where you can be as
you are –or as you want to be-. In parallel this island functions as a
foundation where people, animals and plants could establish their “being with
each other”. In 2008 I was sent to Paraguay by an inner voice, my
voice that always is connected with my higher self. Out of the economic world
of money and hurry and stress into a country slightly larger than Germany,
with only 6 millions inhabitants. Very quickly it became clear that I should be
here and why. A country that for decades had been abused and raped by jungle
clearing (“killing”), and raped through mass livestock and other agricultural
projects. Here now you find a small oasis of tranquillity, an oasis of silence,
an oasis within nature should arise with humans, plants and animals that should
serve as a positive example. On the other hand, however, our natural right and
opportunity to live a natural life within nature should be achieved. My SELF BEEING has always been contrary to the “idea” that man should
live imprisoned in stone or concrete blocks, and one tells you that the
paradise would be a restricted natural resource, a closed shop. In fact man is
part of the nature and paradise and is living much better and healthier in and
with the nature. Neparo is my spiritual name given to me by my last teacher
Michael Barnett. Neparo means “Cosmic Dancer”, which means as much as: “You’re
the center of the universe when you’re moving and if you dance, then the
universe dances andmoves with sheer joy with you and around you”.</p>
<p><b>Reorientation:<br/></b>One thing was clear, the country was expecting a return through
reforestation, restructuration and healing. And it was a mountain plot of 10
hectares (100.000 sqm), which was almost completely cleared purchased.</p>
<p><b>SO SAW IT ALMOST EVERYWHERE                          </b></p>
<p><b>                                                                            <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/224452/files/20131126080449-vorher.jpg?1385481889"" src="""" style=""width: 158.936px; height: 120px;""/></b></p>

<p><b><b>AFTER ONLY ONE YEAR<br/></b></b></p>
<p><b><b>                                                                            <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/224463/files/20131126080702-einjahrdanach.jpg?1385482022"" src="""" style=""width: 160.904px; height: 121px;""/></b></b></p>
<p><b><b><b>Locale Features:</b></b></b><br/>Yes, the property has a special power, and anyone who is familiar with
the ancient civilizations, knows and will soon find out why many ancient
cultures have sougth to establish themselves in the mountains. In the mountains, in the rocks, the layers of earth where there are
thousands of folded and formed by earth move ments, a higher energy of the
earth, a higher vibration in the Earth Grid is present. The plot has a very
high vibration.</p>
<b><b>
</b></b><p>Old Wounds<br/>But what did my heart hurt more is the fact that it once on this
mountain and source plot were so many sources, all of which were dry. We found
evidence for the beneficial water past numerous canyons where the water had
honed over thousands of years, of channels up to 20 meters deep in the ground
and in the rocks. And I saw in my vision that millions of gallons of water that
would flow again from the mountain springs, if we humans would treat very well
this tortured Earth.</p>
<p>                                                                                            <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/224470/files/20131126080949-CANYON.JPG?1385482189"" src="""" style=""width: 178.191px; height: 134px;""/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Healing Process:<br/></b>Said and done, everything went as if by magic. We have the water flow of
the measured sources still available after a drought time of 3 months in 2009
and it came to 86.5000 liters per day. A friend and I put our money into a
common fund, we acquired the land relatively expensive.</p>But the reputation, even to help us as human beings
and our descendants –to create a better world- was so strong that we had to go
into this project simply. We immediately began to plant thousands of trees. To
this end, we commissioned indigenous Paraguayans to us, for a reasonable wage
to collect seeds of native precious and noble trees, from which we grow more
than 10.000 young trees (saplings), we planted them for the most part
ourselves. On top of that we are bringing up other crops on the land, there to
make a new forest culture arise that allows you to live within nature and with
nature.<p>  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/224477/files/20131126081334-AQUA1.jpg?1385482414"" src="""" style=""width: 120.628px; height: 91px;""/>   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/224480/files/20131126081439-aqua2.jpg?1385482479"" src="""" style=""width: 121.333px; height: 91px;""/>   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/224482/files/20131126081516-aqua3.JPG?1385482516"" src="""" style=""width: 121.333px; height: 91px;""/></p>

<p>The perpetrators have been identified. There certainly are not
criminals, because people need to eat of somehow. You just do not have the
awareness of what caused the depletion everything, and they lack financing
which allows to shape the land through reforestation and forest management.<br/>Therefore, it is only operated mainly livestock, sugar cane and
soybeans, which pretty quickly money is earned, and therefore committed
exploitation of nature.<b> </b>Therefore, it is our intention with our project, also educate people and
help them with advices and support. We are sure to reach us rethink and another
action here. Yes, some of our neighbors want already supported us, they even
want to project of to sale a portion or all their land –almost 140 acres-. The
surrounding land, of which we speak here is directly in the conservation area
and desperately needs our help.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Our new meeting place:</p>For about a year we are building as the center of
the project, a small house, which will later serve as a small restaurant and
meeting place. We are working hard to complete.<p>      <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/263953/files/20131216113851-h2.jpg?1387222731"" src="""" style=""width: 125.333px; height: 94px;""/>              <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/263954/files/20131216113903-h3.jpg?1387222743"" src="""" style=""width: 125.333px; height: 94px;""/>              <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/263956/files/20131216114003-h1.jpg?1387222803"" src="""" style=""width: 122.667px; height: 92px;""/></p>

<p>Our Source:<br/>We have enclosed a small water supply source that has a reservoir of
almost 18.000 liters and with which we can supply the house and still planned
buildings and swimming facilities without electricity, using only the force of
gravity.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/263960/files/20131216114253-quelle1.JPG?1387222973"" src="""" style=""width: 146.667px; height: 110px;""/>                                                                    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/263962/files/20131216114324-quelle2.JPG?1387223004"" src="""" style=""width: 155.731px; height: 117px;""/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We will also use water turbines, because the island life is to be
supplied with electrical energy by way absolutely self-sufficient. With this an
enclosed source, we can provide without side effects, up to 100 buildings with
clean spring water.</p>
<p>Multiple Use:<br/>A portion of the spring water we will conduct permanently by the
individual swimming and water basins, and the overflow of the water is then to
be used by the still to be built raised beds –where we want to draw organic
vegetables- are cast. Here we will create the beds so that water –after work-
flows back into the stream, and thus also a cycle is created.<br/>*************************************************************************************************<br/>The total capital requirement for
the project is U$S 600.000.-<br/>On this case U$S 15.000.- for the completion of the house and the
surrounding paths.<br/>For the creation of a swimming pool of U$S 5.000.-<br/>For the installation of new water lines and the construction of 10
raised beds U$S 15.000.-<br/>U$S 15.000 for the purchase and installation of water turbines.<br/>For the construction of five guesthouses are needed U$S 150.000.-<br/>For the purchase of a further 110 hectares, of which will be also
reforested, are required U$S 250.000.-<br/>To cover wages and the small demand, such as the collecting of seeds and
breeding of trees for the next 1-2 years, U$S 150.000.-<br/>************************************************************************************************
<br/>Alternative:<br/>What happens if we do not reach our goal, and the U$S 600.000 do not get
along?</p>Except that the project creates a longer path for further completion, nothing else happens.<br/>This project is not just money that is needed. It lives by the people already involved and will continue to live and grow. Only just a little slower.

<p>Die Lebensinsel in Paraguay.<br/>in der DU leben und SEIN
kannst wie Du bist, oder wie Du sein moechtest, ist wie eine Oase auf einem
kleinen Berg in Paraguay, die Du einerseits als Urlaubs-und Erholungsziel, oder
gar –wenn Du das moechtest auch als deinen Altersruhesitz nutzen kannst.</p>
<p>Keine (reine) Urlaubsinsel!<br/>Menschen benötigen zwar
zeitlich begrenzte Inseln um zur inneren Ruhe und zur Ausgeglichenheit zu
finden. Doch hier soll und darf Jeder dauernd so sein wie er sein möchte, oder
ist. Gleichzeitig soll diese LEBENSINSEL als Stiftung der Umwelt gerecht
werden, in der Menschen, Tiere und Pflanzen miteinander Leben und sein koennen.</p>
<p>Wie es begann:<br/>Im Jahr 2008 wurde ich durch
eine innere Stimme, durch meine Stimme die immer mit meinem hoeheren Selbst in
Verbindung steht, nach Paraguay gefuehrt. Heraus aus der wirtschaftlichen Welt
das Geld verdienen in ein Land, etwas groesser als Deutschland, mit nur knapp 6
Millionen Einwohner. Sehr schnell wurde klar, was ich hier sollte. Ein Land,
das von so vielen Menschen seit Jahrzehnten durch massenhaftes Urwald roden,
durch massenhaften Tierhaltung und andere landwirtschaftliche Projekte
missbraucht und vergewaltigt worden war. Hier sollte eine kleine Oase der
Stille, eine Oase der Ruhe, eine Oase innerhalb del Natur mit Pflanzen und
Tieren entstehen, die einerseits als positives Beispiel dienen kann und wird.
Anderseits aber auch uns Menschen das Recht und die Moeglichkeit einraeumt,
innerhalb del Natur und mit der Natur, leben und sein zu koennen. Meinem SEIN war es schon immer
zuwider, dass der Mensch in Stein-oder Betonburgen eingesperrt leben soll, und
das man die Welt zu einem gesperrten Naturparadies erklaeren will. Kommt doch
auch der Mensch aus del Natur und kann viel besser und gesuender leben in und
mit de Natur.
</p><p>Neuorientierung:<br/>Eines war klar, das Land
erwartete eine Rueckgabe durch Wiederaufforstung, eine Wiedergutmachung und
Heilung. Und so wurde ein Berggrundstueck von 10 Hektar Groesse (100.000 qm),
welches fast vollstaendig gerodet war, gekauft.</p>
<b></b><p></p>
<p><b>
</b></p><p><b>SO SAH ES FAST UEBERALL AUF
DEM GRUNDSTUECK AUS</b><br/>KEINE PFLANZEN, KEINE BAEUME,</p><b>
</b><p></p><p><b>                                                                                                <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/224452/files/20131126080449-vorher.jpg?1385481889"" src="""" style=""width: 140.702px; height: 106px;""/></b></p><p><b><b>

<p>Lokale Besonderheiten:<br/>Ja, das Anwesen hat eine
besondere Energie, und wer sich mit alten Zivilisationen beschaeftigt, der wird
bald herausfinden, warum es so viele alte Kulturen in die Berge zog. In den
Bergen, im Gestein, da wo die Erdschichten tausendfach gefaltet und durch
Erdbewegungen entstanden sind, ist eine hoehere Energie der Erde, eine hoehere
Schwingung im Erdgitternetz vorhanden. Das Grundstueck hat eine sehr hohe
Eigenschwingung.</p>
<p>Alte Wunden:<br/>Aber was meinem Herzen
besonders weh tat, war die Tatsache, dass es einmal auf diesem Berg- und
Quellgrundstueck so viele Quellen gab, die alle versiegt waren. Wir fanden zum
Beweis der segensreichen Wasservergangenheit zahlreiche Schluchten, wo sich das
Wasser ueber Jahrtausende Rinnen bis zu 20 Meter Tiefe in den Boden und in den
Felsen geschliffen hatte. Und ich sah in meiner Vision wieder Millionen von
Litern Wasser die wieder aus den Bergquellen sprudeln wuerden, wenn wir
Menschen us dieser gequaelten Erde annehmen wuerden.</p>

<p>Heilungsprozess:<br/>Gesagt, getan, alles lief wie
von Geisterhand gesteuert. Wir haben den Wasserfluss der noch vorhanden Quellen
nach einer Trockenzeit von 3 Monaten im Jahren 2009 ausgemessen und kamen dabei
auf 86.5000 Litern pro Tag.<br/>Eine Freundin und ich legten
unser Geld in eine gemeinsame Kasse, wir erwarben das Grundstueck relativ
teuer. Aber der Ruf, uns selbst als Mensch und unseren Nachkommen zu helfen
–eine bessere Welt zu erschaffen- war so stark, dass wir einfach in dieses
Projekt einsteigen mussten. Wir fingen sofort an, tausende Baeume zu pflanzen.
Hierzu beauftragten wir einheimische paraguayer uns gegen einen vernuenftigen
Lohn, Samen von einheimischen kostbaren und edlen Baeumen zu sammeln, aus denen
wir mehr als 10.000 junge Baeume zogen die wir zum Grossteil selbst
einpflanzten.<br/>Hinzu kommt dass wir weitere
Kulturpflanzen auf dem Grundstueck asubrachten, um dort eine neue Waldkultur
entstehen zu lassen, die es ermoeglicht, innerhalb der Natur und mit der Natur
zu leben.</p>

<p>Die Taeter stehen fest.Es
sind sicherlich keine Kriminellen, denn die Menschen muessen sich ja irgendwie
ernaehren. Ihnen fehlt einfach noch das Bewusstsein darueber was der Raubbau
alles verursacht, und ihnen fehlt auch eine Finanzierung die es ermoeglicht,
das Land durch Wiederaufforstung und Waldwirtschaft zu gestalten. Deshalb wird
ueberwiegend nur Tierhaltung sowie Zuckerrohr- und Sojaanbau betrieben, womit
ziemlich schnell Geld verdient wird, und damit Raubbau an der Natur begangen.<b> </b>Deshalb ist es unser Anliegen, mit unserem Projekt, die Menschen auch aufzuklaeren, und Ihnen mit Rat und Tat zur Seite zu stehen. Wir sind uns sicher hier ein anderes Handel und ein Umdenken im Sinne des Naturschutzes zu erreichen.  <b></b>Ja einige unserer Nachbarn, wollen uns bereits unterstuezten, sie wollen sogar einen Teil Ihres Landes, manche gar Ihr ganzes Land an das Projekt verkaufen.<br/>Hier kommen knapp 140 Hektar zusammen.<b> </b>Das umliegende Land von dem wir hier sprechen, ist schon Naturschutzgebiet.<br/>Es benoetigt aber die gleiche Hilfe wie auch die Menschen vor Ort.</p><p>Unser neuer TREFFPUNKT<br/>Seit etwa einem Jahr, bauen wir als Zentrum des Projektes, ein kleines Haus.

PARAGUAY.
We create the paradiseThe island where you can live, live as you be or how you want to be.You, the one hand as a holiday and recreation, or even –can use as your
retirement home- if you want to.
None (pure) holiday island!Although people need time, to be in a limited island to find peace and
inner balance too. But here everyone should and can be constantly as he wants to be, or is.
At the same time these “ISLAND
 OF THE LIFE” should meet
as a foundation of the environment in which people, animals and plants can
living together.
How it began:The “island of the life” in Paraguay is part of a small
mountain in which you may use for holidays and recreation, or even as a
retirement home. But it is not a pure holiday resort. Although people need
islands to gain inner peace and balance it is exactly here where you can be as
you are –or as you want to be-. In parallel this island functions as a
foundation where people, animals and plants could establish their “being with
each other”. In 2008 I was sent to Paraguay by an inner voice, my
voice that always is connected with my higher self. Out of the economic world
of money and hurry and stress into a country slightly larger than Germany,
with only 6 millions inhabitants. Very quickly it became clear that I should be
here and why. A country that for decades had been abused and raped by jungle
clearing (“killing”), and raped through mass livestock and other agricultural
projects. Here now you find a small oasis of tranquillity, an oasis of silence,
an oasis within nature should arise with humans, plants and animals that should
serve as a positive example. On the other hand, however, our natural right and
opportunity to live a natural life within nature should be achieved. My SELF BEEING has always been contrary to the “idea” that man should
live imprisoned in stone or concrete blocks, and one tells you that the
paradise would be a restricted natural resource, a closed shop. In fact man is
part of the nature and paradise and is living much better and healthier in and
with the nature. Neparo is my spiritual name given to me by my last teacher
Michael Barnett. Neparo means “Cosmic Dancer”, which means as much as: “You’re
the center of the universe when you’re moving and if you dance, then the
universe dances andmoves with sheer joy with you and around you”.
Reorientation:One thing was clear, the country was expecting a return through
reforestation, restructuration and healing. And it was a mountain plot of 10
hectares (100.000 sqm), which was almost completely cleared purchased.
SO SAW IT ALMOST EVERYWHERE                          
                                                                            


AFTER ONLY ONE YEAR
                                                                            
Locale Features:Yes, the property has a special power, and anyone who is familiar with
the ancient civilizations, knows and will soon find out why many ancient
cultures have sougth to establish themselves in the mountains. In the mountains, in the rocks, the layers of earth where there are
thousands of folded and formed by earth move ments, a higher energy of the
earth, a higher vibration in the Earth Grid is present. The plot has a very
high vibration.

Old WoundsBut what did my heart hurt more is the fact that it once on this
mountain and source plot were so many sources, all of which were dry. We found
evidence for the beneficial water past numerous canyons where the water had
honed over thousands of years, of channels up to 20 meters deep in the ground
and in the rocks. And I saw in my vision that millions of gallons of water that
would flow again from the mountain springs, if we humans would treat very well
this tortured Earth.
                                                                                            


Healing Process:Said and done, everything went as if by magic. We have the water flow of
the measured sources still available after a drought time of 3 months in 2009
and it came to 86.5000 liters per day. A friend and I put our money into a
common fund, we acquired the land relatively expensive.But the reputation, even to help us as human beings
and our descendants –to create a better world- was so strong that we had to go
into this project simply. We immediately began to plant thousands of trees. To
this end, we commissioned indigenous Paraguayans to us, for a reasonable wage
to collect seeds of native precious and noble trees, from which we grow more
than 10.000 young trees (saplings), we planted them for the most part
ourselves. On top of that we are bringing up other crops on the land, there to
make a new forest culture arise that allows you to live within nature and with
nature.        


Today, after 5 years to flow through the work and time spent together,
within one day more than 6 millions liters (6.000 m³) of spring water from the
plot out! Measure from to 2012 to 2013 during 3,5 months without rain.
A SMALL SOURCE IN 12 HOURS 18.000
LITERS WATER GENERATED.
                                                                                                                   


Everything is slowly recovering, the forest growsit bloom again the bushes and shrubsand thrive again the most beautiful plants and fruits.
                                         

                              


Thieving Exploitation:Unfortunately, the little old
forest stand was robbed in the size of 1.5 acres, and there were more than 120
trees at the age of 20 and 50 years and older felled and removed.


               
                               


The perpetrators have been identified. There certainly are not
criminals, because people need to eat of somehow. You just do not have the
awareness of what caused the depletion everything, and they lack financing
which allows to shape the land through reforestation and forest management.Therefore, it is only operated mainly livestock, sugar cane and
soybeans, which pretty quickly money is earned, and therefore committed
exploitation of nature. Therefore, it is our intention with our project, also educate people and
help them with advices and support. We are sure to reach us rethink and another
action here. Yes, some of our neighbors want already supported us, they even
want to project of to sale a portion or all their land –almost 140 acres-. The
surrounding land, of which we speak here is directly in the conservation area
and desperately needs our help.


Our new meeting place:For about a year we are building as the center of
the project, a small house, which will later serve as a small restaurant and
meeting place. We are working hard to complete.                                  


Our Source:We have enclosed a small water supply source that has a reservoir of
almost 18.000 liters and with which we can supply the house and still planned
buildings and swimming facilities without electricity, using only the force of
gravity.
                                                                    


We will also use water turbines, because the island life is to be
supplied with electrical energy by way absolutely self-sufficient. With this an
enclosed source, we can provide without side effects, up to 100 buildings with
clean spring water.
Multiple Use:A portion of the spring water we will conduct permanently by the
individual swimming and water basins, and the overflow of the water is then to
be used by the still to be built raised beds –where we want to draw organic
vegetables- are cast. Here we will create the beds so that water –after work-
flows back into the stream, and thus also a cycle is created.*************************************************************************************************The total capital requirement for
the project is U$S 600.000.-On this case U$S 15.000.- for the completion of the house and the
surrounding paths.For the creation of a swimming pool of U$S 5.000.-For the installation of new water lines and the construction of 10
raised beds U$S 15.000.-U$S 15.000 for the purchase and installation of water turbines.For the construction of five guesthouses are needed U$S 150.000.-For the purchase of a further 110 hectares, of which will be also
reforested, are required U$S 250.000.-To cover wages and the small demand, such as the collecting of seeds and
breeding of trees for the next 1-2 years, U$S 150.000.-************************************************************************************************
Alternative:What happens if we do not reach our goal, and the U$S 600.000 do not get
along?Except that the project creates a longer path for further completion, nothing else happens.This project is not just money that is needed. It lives by the people already involved and will continue to live and grow. Only just a little slower.
***********************************************************************Our Thank You Bueffet : 

We give about rich Each a small Thank You . This is can be used from a little card that is redeemable for holiday.

However, the vouchers are also collectible . And if Someone vouchers from more than U.S. $ 5.000, - has , he may redeem them for a small building plot on the edge of the island life . Hence we have an extra at the foot of the hill country 12 plots of building land of 25 x 25 meters , so divided 625 sqm.

Who vouchers from more than U.S. $ 7.000, - has collected that can redeem them against a land plot on the edge of the island life , on the upper mountain national border to the island life . Here we have another 18 plots of building land of 25 x 25 meters so divided 625 sqm.

For the absolute nature loving helpers:

Who U.S. $ 20.000, - or donates more , or vouchers of more than U.S. $ 20,000 - has collected, the land gets a dierekt within the nature reserve , in the woods . Absolutely individually .
Here, however, can only 6 parcels on GROUND (99 years) will be awarded.

The GROUND is entered and guarantees in the land registry and can be traded and passed on.



After the addition of the other Buy hectares, Everyone gets the more than U.S. $ 5.000, - has Donated, or for more than U.S. $ 5.000, - Vouchers collected, gets a land base within, the then 120-acre island life. Of course, we pay attention to the possibility of a good access and walkability. For each land a 5-meter wide access road will be built.

Who, more than $ 5,000 - Donated or has collected of vouchers that can redeem them on demand against several land parcels.

We can total vouchers of $ 1.200,000, - forgive.

We can forgive a total of 240 plots of building land.

DEUTSCH 
Die Lebensinsel in Paraguay.in der DU leben und SEIN
kannst wie Du bist, oder wie Du sein moechtest, ist wie eine Oase auf einem
kleinen Berg in Paraguay, die Du einerseits als Urlaubs-und Erholungsziel, oder
gar –wenn Du das moechtest auch als deinen Altersruhesitz nutzen kannst.
Keine (reine) Urlaubsinsel!Menschen benötigen zwar
zeitlich begrenzte Inseln um zur inneren Ruhe und zur Ausgeglichenheit zu
finden. Doch hier soll und darf Jeder dauernd so sein wie er sein möchte, oder
ist. Gleichzeitig soll diese LEBENSINSEL als Stiftung der Umwelt gerecht
werden, in der Menschen, Tiere und Pflanzen miteinander Leben und sein koennen.
Wie es begann:Im Jahr 2008 wurde ich durch
eine innere Stimme, durch meine Stimme die immer mit meinem hoeheren Selbst in
Verbindung steht, nach Paraguay gefuehrt. Heraus aus der wirtschaftlichen Welt
das Geld verdienen in ein Land, etwas groesser als Deutschland, mit nur knapp 6
Millionen Einwohner. Sehr schnell wurde klar, was ich hier sollte. Ein Land,
das von so vielen Menschen seit Jahrzehnten durch massenhaftes Urwald roden,
durch massenhaften Tierhaltung und andere landwirtschaftliche Projekte
missbraucht und vergewaltigt worden war. Hier sollte eine kleine Oase der
Stille, eine Oase der Ruhe, eine Oase innerhalb del Natur mit Pflanzen und
Tieren entstehen, die einerseits als positives Beispiel dienen kann und wird.
Anderseits aber auch uns Menschen das Recht und die Moeglichkeit einraeumt,
innerhalb del Natur und mit der Natur, leben und sein zu koennen. Meinem SEIN war es schon immer
zuwider, dass der Mensch in Stein-oder Betonburgen eingesperrt leben soll, und
das man die Welt zu einem gesperrten Naturparadies erklaeren will. Kommt doch
auch der Mensch aus del Natur und kann viel besser und gesuender leben in und
mit de Natur.
Neuorientierung:Eines war klar, das Land
erwartete eine Rueckgabe durch Wiederaufforstung, eine Wiedergutmachung und
Heilung. Und so wurde ein Berggrundstueck von 10 Hektar Groesse (100.000 qm),
welches fast vollstaendig gerodet war, gekauft.


SO SAH ES FAST UEBERALL AUF
DEM GRUNDSTUECK AUSKEINE PFLANZEN, KEINE BAEUME,
                                                                                                
NACH NUR EINEM JAHR
                                                                                               
Lokale Besonderheiten:Ja, das Anwesen hat eine
besondere Energie, und wer sich mit alten Zivilisationen beschaeftigt, der wird
bald herausfinden, warum es so viele alte Kulturen in die Berge zog. In den
Bergen, im Gestein, da wo die Erdschichten tausendfach gefaltet und durch
Erdbewegungen entstanden sind, ist eine hoehere Energie der Erde, eine hoehere
Schwingung im Erdgitternetz vorhanden. Das Grundstueck hat eine sehr hohe
Eigenschwingung.
Alte Wunden:Aber was meinem Herzen
besonders weh tat, war die Tatsache, dass es einmal auf diesem Berg- und
Quellgrundstueck so viele Quellen gab, die alle versiegt waren. Wir fanden zum
Beweis der segensreichen Wasservergangenheit zahlreiche Schluchten, wo sich das
Wasser ueber Jahrtausende Rinnen bis zu 20 Meter Tiefe in den Boden und in den
Felsen geschliffen hatte. Und ich sah in meiner Vision wieder Millionen von
Litern Wasser die wieder aus den Bergquellen sprudeln wuerden, wenn wir
Menschen us dieser gequaelten Erde annehmen wuerden.

                                                                                                                  
Heilungsprozess:Gesagt, getan, alles lief wie
von Geisterhand gesteuert. Wir haben den Wasserfluss der noch vorhanden Quellen
nach einer Trockenzeit von 3 Monaten im Jahren 2009 ausgemessen und kamen dabei
auf 86.5000 Litern pro Tag.Eine Freundin und ich legten
unser Geld in eine gemeinsame Kasse, wir erwarben das Grundstueck relativ
teuer. Aber der Ruf, uns selbst als Mensch und unseren Nachkommen zu helfen
–eine bessere Welt zu erschaffen- war so stark, dass wir einfach in dieses
Projekt einsteigen mussten. Wir fingen sofort an, tausende Baeume zu pflanzen.
Hierzu beauftragten wir einheimische paraguayer uns gegen einen vernuenftigen
Lohn, Samen von einheimischen kostbaren und edlen Baeumen zu sammeln, aus denen
wir mehr als 10.000 junge Baeume zogen die wir zum Grossteil selbst
einpflanzten.Hinzu kommt dass wir weitere
Kulturpflanzen auf dem Grundstueck asubrachten, um dort eine neue Waldkultur
entstehen zu lassen, die es ermoeglicht, innerhalb der Natur und mit der Natur
zu leben.
                            
Heute, nach fast 5 jaehriger
Arbeit, fliessen durch die gemeinsam investierte Arbeit und Zeit, innerhalb
eines Tages wieder mehr als 6 Millionen Liter (6.000 m³) Quellwasser aus dem
Grundstueck heraus!. Ausgemessen im Jahre 2012 auf 2013 nach 3,5 Monaten ohne
Regen.


EINE KLEINE QUELLE DIE IN 12
STUNDEN 18.000 LITER WASSER ERZEUGT,

                                                                                                                            
Alles erholt sich langsam,
der Wald waechst,es bluehen wieder die Baesche
und Straeucher,und es gedeihen wieder die
herrlichsten Pflanzen und Fruechte.

                                                  
Diebischer Raubbau:Leider wurde der kleine alte
Waldbestand in der Groesse von 1,5 Hektar ausgeraubt, und dort wurden mehr als
120 Baeume im Alter von 20 und 50 Jahren und aelter gefaellt und
abtransportiert.
                                                                                             
Die Taeter stehen fest.Es
sind sicherlich keine Kriminellen, denn die Menschen muessen sich ja irgendwie
ernaehren. Ihnen fehlt einfach noch das Bewusstsein darueber was der Raubbau
alles verursacht, und ihnen fehlt auch eine Finanzierung die es ermoeglicht,
das Land durch Wiederaufforstung und Waldwirtschaft zu gestalten. Deshalb wird
ueberwiegend nur Tierhaltung sowie Zuckerrohr- und Sojaanbau betrieben, womit
ziemlich schnell Geld verdient wird, und damit Raubbau an der Natur begangen. Deshalb ist es unser Anliegen, mit unserem Projekt, die Menschen auch aufzuklaeren, und Ihnen mit Rat und Tat zur Seite zu stehen. Wir sind uns sicher hier ein anderes Handel und ein Umdenken im Sinne des Naturschutzes zu erreichen.  Ja einige unserer Nachbarn, wollen uns bereits unterstuezten, sie wollen sogar einen Teil Ihres Landes, manche gar Ihr ganzes Land an das Projekt verkaufen.Hier kommen knapp 140 Hektar zusammen. Das umliegende Land von dem wir hier sprechen, ist schon Naturschutzgebiet.Es benoetigt aber die gleiche Hilfe wie auch die Menschen vor Ort.Unser neuer TREFFPUNKTSeit etwa einem Jahr, bauen wir als Zentrum des Projektes, ein kleines Haus. Es soll spaeter als Restaurant und Treffpunkt dienen. Hier koennen dann unterschiedliche Veranstaltungen der einzellnen Gruppen stattfinden.                          Unsere QuelleWir haben zur Trinkwasserversorgung eine kleine Quelle eingefasst. Die Quelle erzeugte schon nach nur einem Jahr in 12 stunden 18.000 Liter Wasser.                                                                         wir werden hier auch Wasserturbinen einsetzen um zusaetzlich Strom zu erzeugen. Denn die Lebensinsel soll nach Moeglichkeit Autark sein. trotzdem haben wir eine eigene Stromleitung mit 12.000 Volt/Ampere.Die eingefasste Quelle kann bis zu 100 Einfamilienhaeuser mit Wasser Versorgen, da jede Parzelle-jedes Haus einen eigenen Wasserturm erhaellt.MehrfachnutzungEinen Teil des kostbaren Quellwassers, werden wir durch das Schwimmbecken in unsere Obst und Gemuesebeete/Hochbeete leiten, um so noch einen groesseren Nutzen zu haben.*************************************************************************Der KapitalbedarfDer Kapitalbedarf liegt insgesammt bei US$ 600.000,-Hiervon werden US$ 15.000,- fuer die fertigstellung des Gemeindehauses und der umliegenden Wege benoetigt.Fuer die Erstellung eines Pools werden US$ 5.000,- benoetigt.Fuer die Verlegung von weiteren Wasserleitungen und dem Bau von 10 Hochbeeten US$ 15.000,-Fuer den Kauf und Montage von Wasserturbinen werden US$ 15.000,- benoetigt.Fuer den Bau von 5 Gaestehaeusern werden US$ 150.000,- benoetigt.Fuer den Ankauf von weiteren 110 Hektaren, die wir ebenfalls Aufforsten und schuetzen wollen, werden benoetigt US$ 250.000,-Um Loehne und den Kleinbedarf , wie auch das Sammeln und Anzuechten von kostbaren Samen, fuer die naechsten 1-2 Jahre zu decken, werden benoetigt US$ 150.000,-************************************************************************Alternative:Was passiert, wenn wir das Ziel von US$ 600.000,- nicht erreichen???Ausser das dem Projekt ein laengerer Weg bis zur Fertigstellung entsteht, passiert nichts.

<p><strong>What I want to do and why?</strong></p>
<p>Yasuni National Park, in Ecuador, is one of the most biologically diverse areas of the world. Largely unaffected by human activities, it supports an intact fauna of predators like jaguars or pumas, other large terrestrial mammals, at least 10 species of primates, many large birds, and thousands, if not millions, of other organisms. However, the park faces many threats. Oil exploitation, its direct and indirect effects like roads, illegal hunting and logging, habitat loss and wildlife trade, just to mention some, are just around the corner. Ironically, many of the threats that animals face come from the inhabitants of the park itself, due to lack of knowledge or misconceptions about the role of many species in the forest. This generates conflicts that could potentially threaten the coexistence of people and wildlife.</p>
<p>The goal of this, the first part of my project, is to obtain high quality pictures of ground mammals and birds that inhabit Yasuni´s forest, especially species that are elusive and hard to see, using high-resolution camera-traps. I know where and what to look for! Over the last few years I have been able to record over 60 species of mammals and ground birds with the help of camera-traps, obtaining very valuable information on their presence and use of habitat and making this information available through scientific papers. However, although regular camera traps are extremely useful for this purpose, the quality of the pictures is far from good for printing or publishing purposes. With high quality pictures my ultimate intention is to work on a book and other educational materials that can turn in a unique environmental tool to raise awareness and educate people in the local and global community about  the importance of protecting Yasuni´s wildlife. Above all, my goal is to reach the inhabitants of the park itself through material that is less scientific and has a more immediate impact on direct conservation.</p>
<p>What I want to do is to document the diversity and complexity of the exuberant life of Yasuní forest through pictures of real animals in their natural habitat. I think nothing tells better a story more effectively than images and I want to use the power of photos to promote conservation. I have extensive experience using camera traps and the eye required to capture a photograph that is truly meaningful to a viewer!. Humans have great capacity to change and destroy habitats and therefore to reduce the chances of species surviving. I am convinced that with the help of the book I intend to work on, these effects can be somehow reversed, enabling people to enjoy the beauty and diversity of species without harming them, in a beautiful, compelling, and emotionally connective way. I want to be able to connect viewers with their sense of responsibility to protect and conserve what we have left, and restore what we have lost.</p>
<p>Although Yasuní has a protected area status in paper, in reality eminent threats are getting closer and closer to the core of the park. The inhabitants of the park and the buffer area, both locals and indigenous, in some cases have never been able to witness their local wildlife. Despite the threats, the effort of the local authorities to stop indiscriminate killing and trade, apart from some isolated low success campaigns, has been limited or not existent at all. Many of the people I have talked to tell me that they have only seen animals like jaguars, ocelots or tapirs in bush markets or dead. If people don’t understand the importance and beauty of the forest and its wildlife, this will just keep going on. Despite the extensive research and effort to protect Yasuni, there have not been any formal education materials that can be distributed among local communities. My purpose is to show the message behind the research in a way that engages a broader audience, communicating the need to protect wild spaces.</p>
<p>There are many reasons to protect wildlife, from ecological to economic, legal, cultural, emotional, ethical or even religious approaches. However, these reasons have not promoted the conservation that is needed in Yasuní. I think it is vital to encourage people to have a better understanding of wildlife and its protection for conservation in any way possible. A book with pictures of real animals in their very own home will draw a new appreciation for wildlife from viewers of these images, making them aware of the importance to protect them and save them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What am I going to do with the money?</strong></p>
<p>Photographic equipment, in general, tends to be quite expensive. Your donations will help me to cover the cost of the equipment I need in order to obtain high quality pictures for the book. I am requesting your help to get three DSLR cameras with wide-angle lenses, a set of flashes for each camera, plus an extra set for my old Nikon that I also intend to use. Also, your donations will cover the cost of special active sensors needed to activate the cameras and flash cords and sensor cables that need to be custom made. I will also get all the materials I need to use to build cases for the cameras in order to protect them from the extreme weather conditions of the jungle (pelican boxes, PVC tubes, silicone, dissecant, etc). </p>

<p><strong><em>Qué quiero hacer y por qué?</em></strong></p>
<p>El Parque Nacional Yasuní, en Ecuador, es una de las áreas de mayor riqueza biológica del planeta.  Poco afectado por actividades humanas, el parque es hogar de grandes predadores como jaguares o pumas, otros mamíferos terrestres, al menos 10 especies de primates, muchísimas especies de aves y miles, sino millones, de otros organismos. Sin embargo, el parque enfrenta serias amenazas. La explotación petrolera y sus efectos directos e indirectos como carreteras, tala y cacería ilegal, perdida de hábitat y tráfico de vida silvestre están a la vuelta de la esquina. Irónicamente, muchas de las amenazas que enfrenta la vida silvestre de Yasuní provienen de sus mismos pobladores, por falta de conocimiento, mitos o percepciones erróneas sobre el papel de muchas de estas especies. Esto genera serios conflictos que potencialmente amenazan la convivencia pacífica entre humanos y vida silvestre.</p>
<p>La meta de esta, la primera parte de mi proyecto, es obtener fotografías de alta calidad de mamíferos y aves terrestres que habitan los bosques de Yasuní, especialmente especies que son elusivas y muy difíciles de ver, utilizando cámaras trampa de alta resolución. Sé qué buscar y donde! Durante los últimos años he registrado más de 60 especies de mamíferos y aves, obteniendo información invaluable sobre su distribución y el uso de hábitat. También he dado a conocer estos resultados a través de publicaciones científicas. Sin embargo, aunque las cámaras trampa típicas proveen información que es muy útil para propósitos científicos, la calidad de las fotografías está lejos de ser buena propósitos de impresión o publicación en un libro. Con fotografías de alta calidad, mi intención es trabajar en un libro y otros materiales educativos que puedan convertirse en una herramienta única para crear conciencia y educar a la comunidad local y global sobre la importancia de proteger la vida silvestre de Yasuní. Sobretodo, mi meta es llegar a los habitantes del mismo parque con un material que sea menos científico y más ilustrativo y que tenga un impacto más directo en la conservación.</p>
<p>Lo que quiero hacer es documentar la diversidad y complejidad de la exuberante vida de Yasuní a través de fotos de animales reales en su hábitat natural. Considero que nada cuenta una historia de manera más efectiva que las imágenes, y quiero usar el poder de la fotografía para promover la conservación. Tengo amplia experiencia utilizando cámaras trampa y el “ojo requerido” para capturar fotografías que tengan un verdadero significado en el observador. Los seres humanos tenemos una gran capacidad de alterar hábitats y de reducir las oportunidades de que las especies sobrevivan. Estoy convencido de que con la ayuda del libro en el que pretendo trabajar, estos efectos pueden verse reducidos, logrando que las personas disfruten la belleza y la diversidad de especies sin causarles daño, de una manera que los conecte emocionalmente. Quiero descubrir en la audiencia el sentido de responsabilidad de proteger y conservar lo que nos queda y de restaurar lo que ya hemos perdido.</p>
<p>Aunque Yasuní es una área protegida en papel, la realidad es que las amenazas están cada vez mas cerca del núcleo del parque. Sus habitantes, tanto colonos como indígenas, en muchos casos nunca han visto con sus propios ojos de la fauna del lugar. A pesar de las amenazas, el esfuerzo de las autoridades locales para detener la caza indiscriminada y el comercio de animales, aparte de uno que otro material o campaña de poco éxito, ha sido prácticamente inexistente. Mucha de la gente con la que hablado me ha contado que sólo han visto animales como jaguares, tigrillos o tapires, muertos o en mercados ilegales de fauna silvestre. Si la gente no comprende la importancia y la belleza del bosque y su fauna, esto simplemente continuará. A pesar de la extensa investigación y esfuerzos para proteger Yasuní, no existen materiales educativos que puedan distribuirse entre las comunidades locales. Mi propósito es mostrar el mensaje detrás de la investigación de manera que atraiga mas gente, comunicando la necesidad de proteger espacios para la vida silvestre.</p>
<p>Existen muchas razones para proteger la vida silvestre, desde el punto de vista económico, legal, cultural, emocional, ético o incluso religioso. No obstante, estos acercamientos no han sido suficientes para promover la conservación que se necesita en Yasuní. Considero que es vital alentar a la gente, de cualquier forma posible, a que entienda mejor el porqué conservar la vida silvestre. Un libro con fotos reales de animales libres y en su propio hábitat natural llamará la atención de la audiencia, especialmente la que convive con ellos, sobre la importancia de protegerlos y salvarlos.</p>

<p>El equipo fotográfico, en general, tiende a ser muy caro. Sus donaciones me ayudarán a cubrir el costo del equipo que necesito para obtener fotografías de alta calidad para el libro.

Sus donaciones también me ayudarán a cubrir el costo de sensores especiales requeridos para activar las cámaras y cables para flashes y sensores que necesitan ser fabricados a la medida.

Summary
We are Lafayette's Energy Future ( LafEnergy.org ), a grassroots Issue Committee in Lafayette, CO.  We want a more sustainable energy future, and it seems to us that our monopoly utility, Xcel Energy, does not take this seriously.  We want to give Lafayette citizens a choice on energy direction - the status quo with Xcel Energy, heavy on the coal, or a more sustainable energy path based on more renewable energy and energy efficiency.  
So we are encouraging Lafayette voters to say ""NO"" to another 20-year franchise agreement with Xcel (NO on 2A!) in order to send a message that we want more clean energy and energy efficiency programs in Lafayette!  
We gathered signatures to get a replacement for the franchise fee on the ballot.  The Utility Occupation Tax (UOT) (YES on 301!) will be collected the same way the franchise fee is currently collected, and will be the same amount in year 1.  The franchise fee currently goes to Lafayette's General Fund, but UOT funds will be dedicated to renewable energy and energy efficiency; these INVESTMENTS will pay the city back over time!  The UOT will ONLY be collected if the franchise fee is not.  
We are standing up and telling this powerful utility that the future of this planet is for all of us, and if they won't get serious about cutting carbon emissions, we'll start doing it for them!     

What
We Need & What You Get

PayPal donations help us right now, when we need it!  Please consider making your donation via PayPal! Thanks! 
We need to be able to get the word out about the impacts of our proposed votes:
NO on 2A (20-year Xcel franchise agreement) and 
YES on 301 (Utility Occupation Tax) to replace the franchise fee for the city.  
Printing costs money!  Xcel will undoubtedly throw mass quantities of literature at voters, and we must be able to reach those same voters with the information they need to make an informed, responsible decision.  
If you support this campaign, you can feel good knowing that you helped a small grassroots campaign stand up to a utility GIANT for what is right, for what we KNOW we need to do!   

The
Impact
We want to set an example for other communities, to show them that they CAN make a difference!  
We want to be the pebble in the pond that begins the sea change toward a healthier future for our children, and theirs. 
Share this with your friends!

<p><strong>We are releasing BIDDER 70 in theatres on Earth Day!</strong></p>
<p>This Earth Day, Monday, April 22nd, 2013, the day after Tim DeChristopher will be released from the prison system, we are going to celebrate with a countrywide, simultaneous theatrical screening of the award-winning documentary, BIDDER 70, followed by an hour-long discussion with Tim (who will be attending the Salt Lake City screening) that will be broadcast to theatres via Skype, and a Q&amp;A that everyone can participate in via Twitter (you can Tweet a question using a Twitter hashtag, from wherever you're attending)!</p>

<p><span class=""font_8""><span class=""color_12"">Once in a while someone comes along that totally wows you. That’s how we felt when we read about Tim DeChristopher.  As bidder #70, DeChristopher bid 1.8 million dollars and saved 22,000 acres of pristine wilderness.  No property was destroyed, no one was hurt, and valid concerns were raised over the entire BLM oil and gas leasing process.  Bidder 70 was a story we wanted to tell.</span></span></p>
<p><span class=""font_8""><span class=""color_12"">Since 1993, Gage &amp; Gage Productions has produced feature documentaries that inspire, educate and entertain; with Bidder 70, we will also motivate.  Tim DeChristopher is a young man with a message that needs to be heard.

<p><strong>We cannot do it without your help!</strong></p>

<p><strong>What we need:</strong></p>
<p>We've got perks that directly defray the costs of, or entirely fund, theatrical screenings of BIDDER 70 all over the United States. These perks include: GREENLIGHT A SCREENING, ULTIMATE GREENLIGHT PACKAGE, and PRIVATE EARTH DAY SCREENING. As for the rest...</p>
<p>Here's how the $15,000 breaks down:</p>
<p>$2,000 Covers the Salt Lake City main event (includes theatre rental/buyout, press line 'Step &amp; Repeat', photographer, staff, equipment for discussion/Q&amp;A, etc)</p>
<p>$1,000 Covers airfare and transporation for New York musician, <a href=""http://www.reverbnation.com/bryancahall"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Bryan Cahall"">Bryan Cahall</a>, to come to Salt Lake City in order to perform at the Earth Day screening.</p>
<p>$1,500 Covers the cost of creating a DCP (Digital Cinema Package) which is the preferred delivery format of the film, so that the majority of theatres, nationwide, will be able to exhibit it.</p>
<p>$4,500 Covers a publicity firm (2 months, March/April) that will issue press releases, encourage local/national news to cover the event, get us online and offline features/editorials/event listings, place Tim and/or the filmmakers (Beth and George Gage) on local/national radio and television, etc</p>
<p>$2,000 Covers the cost of creating, printing and shipping the movie posters to the theatres</p>
<p>$500 Covers the cost of creating, printing and shipping 'lobby cards' to Movie Captains (local volunteers who are promoting screenings) to pass out.</p>
<p>$3,500 Covers the costs of geo-targetted Google and/or Facebook ads to help build awareness for our Movie Captains' local screenings in order to help them 'tip' their screenings.</p>
<p>$1,500 Covers the fees and taxes that IndieGoGo charges so that we can net $15,000</p>
<p>If we can raise more funds:</p>
<p>$3,000 Covers the costs of inserting paid ads (e.g. LA Weekly, Salt Lake City Tribune, Village Voice, etc...) wherever Movie Captains are championing screenings in order to help them 'tip' their screenings.</p>
<p>$150 Covers the DCP (Digital Cinema Package) copy and also the shipping/receiving. So, everytime we raise an additional $150, we will be able to defray that much of the cost for individual screenings, thereby lowering the barrier to entry for having the screenings!</p>

<p>We are <a href=""https://gathr.us/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Gathr Films"">Gathr</a>, a group of filmmakers who have set out to democratize theatrical distribution because we've been disheartened by the inability of so many worthy films to get into theatres and to be seen by communities around the country.</p>
<p>We created a new, bottom-up model for theatrical distribution that allows anyone, anywhere to request a screening of a movie -- and by getting enough ticket reservations -- to 'tip' that screening opportunity so that it is able to been seen in the local community.</p>
<p>We have had the great pleasure of helping many important films reach wider audiences in the short time we've been around, including <a href=""https://gathr.us/films/the-central-park-five"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""THE CENTRAL PARK FIVE"">THE CENTRAL PARK FIVE</a>, <a href=""https://gathr.us/films/mea-maxima-culpa"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""MEA MAXIMA CULPA"">MEA MAXIMA CULPA</a>, and the upcoming <a href=""GirlRising.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Girl Rising"">GIRL RISING</a>, for which we've already had close to 500 screening requests!</p>

<p style=""margin-left: 90px;""> </p>
<p><strong>How do Gathr screenings of BIDDER 70 happen?</strong></p>
<p>Gathr screenings happen when a minimum number of people reserve tickets before a predetermined expiration date. We call this “tipping” the screening. On every screening page, you’ll find an update that shows you the number of current reservations, the number of additional reservations needed to tip the screening, as well as how much time remains before that screening request expires. When enough people reserve tickets to a screening before time expires, the screening takes place. If the minimum number of reservations is not met, the screening does not take place and nobody is charged.</p>

<p><strong>Who can request a Gathr screening?</strong></p>
<p>You can! Anyone can request to host a screening, making them a BIDDER 70 Captain. Simply fill out a <a href=""http://gathr.us/films/bidder-70/request-new-screening"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Screening Request Form"">Screening Request</a> to indicate when and where you want to screen BIDDER 70. Gathr will then work to confirm the request and then a page for your screening request becomes live on the <a href=""http://www.gathr.us"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Gathr.Us"">gathr.us</a> site. Whether you’re an individual, an organization, or a theater, you can request a screening. It’s fun, simple, and only takes a few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>What can you do to make my screening happen?</strong></p>
<p>We’ve prepared all kinds of tools and resources to help you promote and tip your screening, which we will inform you of, directly, and which will be forthcoming in our BIDDER 70 newsletters.  You’ll be hearing from the BIDDER 70 team regularly with new promotion ideas, sample Tweets and Facebook posts, updates on events like festival screenings, and more, so that you can use all of this to promote and tip your screening.</p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between reserving a ticket and purchasing a ticket?</strong></p>
<p>When a screening of BIDDER 70 has not been “tipped,” your option is to reserve a ticket by pre-authorizing your credit card. When a movie has been “tipped”, your ticket purchase will be processed immediately.</p>
<p><strong>When will your credit card be charged?</strong></p>
<p>Your credit card will only be charged once your screening has met the minimum number of reservations and has been tipped. It works just like IndieGoGo!</p>

In the 1980's I had the experience of bringing Central American people and their powerful stories of human rights abuses into mainstream Indiana communities, where, to my surprise and delight, the stories helped to seed a refugee sanctuary movement. </p><p>Today I believe there is no <b>bigger problem we face than global climate change</b>. Here in Maine I've met a number of activists of all ages who are putting their values and passion to work for climate justice. My experience in the Midwest has led me to believe in the <b>power of stories to change hearts and minds</b>. Now I'm working with videographer Charlie Hudson to bring these Maine stories, told by a new generation of activists, to audiences that might need a gentle nudge. </p><p><b>With our film of inspiring stories</b> as a centerpiece, we plan to facilitate <b>workshops</b> that will help participants explore their own values and how they might address the urgent climate crisis. We are creating a <b>journaling workbook</b> that draws from the filmed stories and may guide people into deeper personal and community commitment to climate and social justice activism.</p><p>We are developing several different modes to present the <b>Down to Earth</b> materials. We hope to engage people of all ages, both the choir and those sitting on the fence, who may be moved to join the climate justice movement. Here are some of our plans:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>A <b>four-week experience</b> that includes four workshops featuring our film, invited guest activists, visioning exercises, and time for sharing workshop participants' own stories arising out of daily journaling in the workbook guide.</li>
<li>A <b>virtual workshop</b> experience similar to the one described above.</li>
<li>A <b>two-hour workshop including our film and time for reflection</b> on filmed stories that spoke to audience members. A handout with opportunities for further reflection and action steps and resources.</li>

</div></div>","The Down to Earth Storytelling Project is capturing stories on film that can connect people everywhere to the growing climate justice movement. ---> Help us commission an original score! 2016 stretch goals down below! <---Hi, I'm Andy Burt. In the 1980's I had the experience of bringing Central American people and their powerful stories of human rights abuses into mainstream Indiana communities, where, to my surprise and delight, the stories helped to seed a refugee sanctuary movement. Today I believe there is no bigger problem we face than global climate change. Here in Maine I've met a number of activists of all ages who are putting their values and passion to work for climate justice. My experience in the Midwest has led me to believe in the power of stories to change hearts and minds. Now I'm working with videographer Charlie Hudson to bring these Maine stories, told by a new generation of activists, to audiences that might need a gentle nudge. With our film of inspiring stories as a centerpiece, we plan to facilitate workshops that will help participants explore their own values and how they might address the urgent climate crisis. We are creating a journaling workbook that draws from the filmed stories and may guide people into deeper personal and community commitment to climate and social justice activism.We are developing several different modes to present the Down to Earth materials. We hope to engage people of all ages, both the choir and those sitting on the fence, who may be moved to join the climate justice movement. Here are some of our plans:
A four-week experience that includes four workshops featuring our film, invited guest activists, visioning exercises, and time for sharing workshop participants' own stories arising out of daily journaling in the workbook guide.
A virtual workshop experience similar to the one described above.
A two-hour workshop including our film and time for reflection on filmed stories that spoke to audience members. A handout with opportunities for further reflection and action steps and resources.
With your help we can complete the film and materials and take the workshop on the road and into virtual reality. We offer perks that enable you to support the Down to Earth Project with a contribution, but also allow you to participate in the film and workshop experiences.

<li>We support and contribute to local sightings networks providing <b>scientists</b> and <b>managers</b> with important data.</li>
<li>By watching whales from shore we are engaging in <b>responsible</b> whale watching by not contributing to ocean noise or presence of vessels on the water, which have been shown to negatively affect whales.</li>

 Research shows that when people have experiences with whales coupled with the presence of an expert naturalist, they are more likely to engage in stewardship activities that will ultimately bring positive benefits for the whales.  Our Whale Scout volunteers strive to do just that and more.  


Our first ""Helpin' Out"" event was attended by over 35 people!  We spread over 20 cubic yards of mulch and planted over 200 trees all in the name of healthy salmon to feed orcas!
More reasons to support Whale Scout: 
We provide FREE whale watching experiences at local parks providing a service to those who may not be able to afford trips to the San Juan Islands or other whale watching destinations.
We support and contribute to local sightings networks providing scientists and managers with important data.
By watching whales from shore we are engaging in responsible whale watching by not contributing to ocean noise or presence of vessels on the water, which have been shown to negatively affect whales.
In just one ""Helpin' Out"" event we had over 35 people spread 20 cubic yards of mulch and plant 200 trees!

As the ""Blackfish effect"" sweeps the country, more people are choosing to not support institutions which display orcas such as SeaWorld.  Whale Scout provides another opportunity for people to view orcas in the wild for FREE.  
Watching whales gives us so much joy and inspiration.  Whale Scout strives to reciprocate by restoring the whales' food sources, salmon.
We are a volunteer-run organization - all of your contributions go towards the benefit of the whales, the environment, and our local communities. 

  We need your help today. Please donate now! So you have donated and want to do more?  This is what you can do to help: 
Get the word out and make some noise about this campaign.  Share this on facebook, twitter, your forehead, wherever!  You never know who in your social network might be a closet whale-lover.


Thank you!

<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>How do farmers farm if the soil is void of nutrients? Without the ability to grow proper vegetation, how do the farmers of Haiti expect to provide for their families? These are questions worth asking.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">My name is Maggie Jackson. I'm a 26-year old barista currently living just outside of Denver, Colorado. I have no background in agriculture nor in business, so how in the world did I get involved in this? </span></p>
<p>I started going down to Haiti just a few months after the devastating earthquake in January 2010 and couldn't stop going back. I've taken 7 trips since then, some of which were multiple months at a time. As a result, I have learned the Haitian Creole language and have been able to ask some bigger questions like, ""How can we create real change in the lives of the Haitian people? How can we help them help themselves?"" Through this journey of questions, I have learned some life-changing answers and have stumbled upon a couple organizations who once asked the same questions. Where I am now, what I have learned and the resources that are present before me, allow me to know without a doubt that I'd be totally missing it if I didn't move forward in this. So, what is this?</p>
<p>Well, first you need to understand that farming is the only resource in what is considered the poorest country in the world, but  there seem to be so few organizations down in Haiti who are focused on this. Due to the drastic deforestation in the 1970's and the erosion that came as a result, there is an extreme lack of nutrients in the soil to grow proper vegetation. The people of Haiti, specifically Seguin which lies at the very top of the mountain, need more than just relief work. What they need is long-term change and the ability to stand on their own two feet. What they need is to be able to create a livelihood for their family.</p>
<p>But why reinvent the wheel? Luckily, I am not the first to take action and those before have offered to educate those to come.</p>
<p>CODEP, an organization currently working at the base of the mountain, took action on this exact same issue over 20 years ago. Their main program is to teach communities of Haitians a natural process of farming which works with the soil to create organic nutrients and allow for rich, healthy vegetation and even grow some vegetables during a season when they were originally believed to not be able to be grown (check out CODEP's webpage if you would like to learn the actual process - <a href=""http://www.haitifundinc.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.haitifundinc.org</a>). They have spent over 2 decades working alongside the Haitian people to learn how best to serve them. As a result, there are now 7 different areas throughout Haiti, each inhabiting miles after square miles of land which were once close to barren and now crowded with growth and possibility (or moving in that direction). The people of Haiti not involved with CODEP have noticed the change in the product that these Haitian farmers have created and will now pay an even higher price simply if the name, CODEP, is placed on the particular product. Not only that, but CODEP, through leadership training and meaningful relationships, is almost all Haitian run and operated. Once I stumbled upon CODEP, visited their properties and spoke with the Haitians involved, I knew I had found my answer. I knew that I needed to take that answer to the people at the very top of the mountain who could never have even dreamed that such an answer could exist. </p>
<br/> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>What is needed is $3,000 in order to get this idea off the ground. Every dollar raised will go directly to the project. There isn't a trustee board who will pocket the funds. No gimmicks, just what you see. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. The layout of where all the money will be going is found below:</p>
<p>$1,400 plane tickets for me and my husband, Patrick</p>

<p>John Winings, the Executive Director of CODEP, has offered to provide me with all the necessities to make this happen. I will be learning what worked and what didn't work, so that I will not have to make the same mistakes CODEP had made in the beginning while learning how to work with the norms of the Haitian culture. CODEP will also be providing the Haitian leaders (each have farmed with CODEP for 20+ years) to journey up the mountains to teach the farmers of Sequin the process.</p>
<br/><ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>By partnering with CODEP and providing the opportunity for these farmers in the mountains to learn and establish this process, we are not only growing rich, healthy vegetation, but we are literally changing lives. The level of poverty in the mountains is unexplainable, but it is not without hope. Handouts only go so far and are unsustainable, but the ability to provide for one's family can impact individuals, communities, whole towns for years to come. The process itself does not only focus on the farming, but long-term looks also at community needs through building schools and, if the farmer goes five years without cutting down the trees they are growing, their family receives a 2-room house with treated lumber. It is something those in the mountains have never even dreamed of. </p>
<p>I intend to not just oversee the farmers, but join with them; get to know each of them personally, along with their families, and create opportunities for them to learn leadership skills and join in the decision-making processes of Deeply Rooted. It is for the Haitians and will soon be run by the Haitians. </p>
<br/><ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>I must be completely transparent and admit that I am unaware of what's to come. Maybe that's a terrible fundraising strategy, to admit that, but my journey thus far has only allowed me to see the next step (while dreaming about the whole staircase). There is a chance that the farmers of Sequin will hear what it is that those of CODEP are saying, but refuse to buy into it. There is a chance that the process, though it works amazing at the valley level, may not be nearly as successful in the rocky soil of the mountains. There are many possibilities against us, but we must try. I have the backing of a more than experienced organization as well as the leader of a community of farmers in Seguin who has given me the go ahead, so here we go. I cannot guarantee anything, but that I will try and if that doesn't work, I will try again. I have gotten this far by being faithful in simply what is before me and I intend on seeing it through to the end. <br/></p>

Want a snazzy Kanga stocking to adorn your mantel? Here's your chance! Made by a local seamstress, there's only a few of these beautiful holiday stockings, so order now!The Flower Kanga StockingOr, The Holiday Kanga StockingBack by popular demand, we’ve got Santa’s only option for your loved ones who’ve misbehaved: coal made from poop, naturally! Sanivation has provided hundreds of people in Kenya with a safe and healthy place to use the loo and take a poo with our sanitation service. We transform the poo into power, THIS COAL, that makes the perfect gift for anyone who has been “naughty.” We both know there’s at someone in your life who needs this stocking stuffer. Don’t worry, our coal is completely safe and doesn’t smell (but you don’t have to tell them that!) Order Santa’s Stinkiest Stocking by December 16th and it will make it to their doorstep by Christmas.With Santa’s Stinkiest Stocking we’ll send three of our charcoal briquettes, nestled in a small,  holiday stocking, to your mischievous mate, naughty neighbor, ornery offspring, or whomever you think would get a kick out of getting coal for a cause this Christmas. We’ll even top off the stocking with a personalized note explaining why they’re getting this special coal.Have a friend that’s been extra naughty this year? For $100, name a toilet in their honor! The average toilet processes over 1,800 yule logs (aka poops!) each year. That’s 1,800 trips to the toilet that people can now take in the safety of their own home instead of over a dirty and dangerous shared pit latrine. We'll even send you a picture of the toilet with their name written on it!These are our toilets – BlueBox! They are portable, container based toilets that we install in peoples’ homes for free. Then we collect the waste twice a week and bring it to our processing facility to transform it into the coal you are about to send to your loved ones.Not only will people chuckle at this coal, they will also feel warm for the holidays. The coal actually burns longer than traditional charcoal. More importantly, people will feel warm in their hearts. You’re helping us, Sanivation, a Kenyan, award-winning social enterprise (see awards below), tackle two big challenges: 

Preventing diarrheal diseases. Everyday, 2,200 children die worldwide from sanitation related illnesses. In fact, diarrhea is the leading cause of death in Kenya for children under five—largely because 95% of human poo is dumped into the environment without treatment (This is silly, particularly when it could be coal instead!)

Saving forests by replacing traditional charcoal with coal derived from human poo!
Hundreds of people in Kenya now have safe and clean in-home toilets to take care of business because of our sanitation service.  With your support, we’ll deploy 500 toilets in the coming year and save over 50,000 trees!Each briquette bundle YOU buy will help us save 22 trees and lower the risk of diarrhea disease in local communities.*When we receive your order, we will send you an e-mail to get the names and addresses you would like to send Santa's Stinkiest Stocking to!*TestimonialsUpon receiving this gift, Your friend might say:“Sh*t! Coal!” …. and she would be accurate.Your husband might say:“Aww, I’m on Santa’s naughty list again!?""Early user reviews:“Lumps of coal for Christmas? Really Jon?! It’s all I ever wanted!” -Your next door neighbor“This is the s**ttiest piece of coal I’ve ever seen.” -Coal expert“Can’t wait to throw these logs on the fire!” -  Your local lumberjack“Even I don’t smell anything!” – Maia, Sanivation’s MascotActual briquettes customer reviews:“The local charcoal produced a lot of smoke and gave headaches and hurt the eyes. The Sanivation Briquettes make no smoke at all!”- Dennis“I light it in the morning and it can cook until 3 or 4pm so it saves me money.”- Esther“Where are the briquettes?! We want your briquettes!” - EliWe take #4 very seriously. Back By Popular DemandLast year, we shipped out over 150 Stockings Full of Sh*t. And people thought it was AMAZING. So much so, that they’ve demanded we do it again. We couldn’t say no. Because we secretly all have someone we know who needs a little coal in their stocking.We’re launching an Indiegogo to make it even bigger this year. In 2015, naughty individuals received a burlap sack with briquettes. This year, we’ve upgraded – you’re getting a stocking!What We DoWe are Sanivation – a social enterprise reimagining healthy and safe sanitation services for urbanizing communities, starting in Naivasha, Kenya. We install modern, container-based toilets in peoples’ homes for free and collect the waste bi-weekly from the households we service. Then, instead of dumping the waste, we transform it into a clean burning alternative to charcoal using solar technologies we developed in the field, for the field.Who We AreWe are an eclectic group of passionate engineers, innovators, and operators on a mission to transform sanitation and fuel provision for the urban poor!We believe that everyone deserves access to safe and dignified sanitation, every day. Our team is working to make this a reality, starting for the people of Naivasha, Kenya and Kakuma Refugee Camp and growing rapidly.Meet our Co-FoundersAndrew Foote – CEO –Favorite Poop Joke: If the Queen farts, is it a noble gas?Always the mediator, Andrew received degrees in both Cultural Anthropology and Environmental Engineering to create human-centered technical solutions to WASH challenges.

<p>Each year we coordinate Mission: Clean Stream where hundreds of volunteers fan out across the rivers and streams to get muddy and clean up.  The Stream Trash ART project gives metal from that clean up to sculptors who create works of art that are then on display throughout the region, providing an educational message about the need to keep our waters clean.  Our Sunlight Quilt Project, takes fabric made by kids who are learning about invasive species and gives it to quilters who create works of art which are used to raise funds to buy tools like honeysuckle poppers, making invasive removal even easier.  We will be out in force for National Public Lands Day in the Fall, planting hundreds of native trees in parks and refuges across the confluence region. On water quality monitoring days we take whole streams or large watershed snapshots of data.  Each year, we give hundreds of volunteers the chance to say they made a difference.  Right here.  Right now.</p>
<p>No one around here gets paid.  We work hard to minimize our costs so that we can put our resources where our shovels are, in the ground and out of the water.  We operate on a shoe string but we can’t operate on air. </p>
<p>For the past five years, Greenway Network has hosted the Race for the Rivers.  It started as a pledge-based canoe and kayak race to raise awareness of our river resources and to raise money to plant more trees and dispose of more tires.  It has grown to include three paddle events, two bike rides, a music fest and a whole lot of educational activities.  We bring people to the river. </p>
<p>This year, we have a unique opportunity to get hundreds of average people, families and kids, out on the river in voyageur class canoes.  They will spend a few minutes learning about paddling and about the river.  Then they will board the canoes and paddle on the river. </p>
<p>We want to give people who might not imagine they could be in a canoe a chance to experience the river first hand.  Your financial support will enable us to bring in six voyageur class canoes and guides to give river rides.  Additional funds will be used to expand the festival to include more educational activities for kids, attract bigger music acts and make the festival greener.</p>
<p>We need to raise $7,000 from new sources to bring in the canoes.  The money is needed to pay for transportation and for the expert guides who will safely lead workshops and take folks out on the river.  The canoes are coming from Wilderness Inquiry.  They are a non-profit organization based in Minnesota with the experts and expertise to put 800 – 1000 people a day out on the water.  They will be here for 2 days.  Which means we will have the potential to get 2,000 people on the Big Muddy. </p>
<p>We need a lot of money.  We have already raised $3,000 toward our goal.  We really don’t have far to go.  Our premiums are modest because we want to plant trees more than we want to use up resources making more stuff.  But we do want you to have a way to show off your support.  Anyone who contributes will receive recognition on our website. </p>
<ul>
<li>We have a killer logo and will send out a window cling for anyone donating at least $10. </li>
<li>For $25 we will send you an EPA approved water bottle.  We believe in reusable water bottles and we do everything we can to get them into the hands of people to use instead of bottled water.   </li>
<li>At the $50 donation level, we will send you one of our t-shirts in addition to the water bottle and window cling.    </li>
<li>Anyone donating $100 gets all of the previous prizes plus a booth space at the festival and your name on the official Race for the Rivers T-shirt. </li>
<li>There are two Greening the Festival Sponsorships.  They come with all of the previous premiums, plus a choice booth space.  More importantly one will provide for refillable water bottles and water to be given to festival attendees.  The other will enable us to enhance our recycling efforts. </li>
<li>There are six opportunities to sponsor a support boat.  We field support boats with communication equipment on the river.   They are there for the safety of our paddlers.  This level of sponsorship will add a banner with your name or logo on “your” support boat and special recognition at the festival and on website. </li>
<li>We also have one opportunity for you to have your very own music fest.  At least you can have your name and/or logo on the music fest.  You will be recognized at the festival including an introduction on stage.  Your contribution will enable us to beef up the sound system and enhance the music.  You will have a prime booth space next to the pavilion and a banner on the stage. </li>
</ul><p>Any funds raised beyond our $4000 goal will be put to good use.  We don’t pay any salaries so we can use that money to purchase tools, trees, native plants and safety equipment for our volunteers.  We have a lot of riparian areas waiting for the resources to make an improvement.  Your cash will be put to use directly for that purpose. </p>
<p>The thing that makes this project have such an impact is that it brings new people to the river.  People who might never show up for a canoe race or music festival will turn out because they want to have a free ride in a big canoe.  Perhaps because of history, perhaps because it is free, perhaps because they don’t have anything else to do.  The canoes will bring them to the river.  We will then have the chance to connect them to it.  To build a relationship.   It is a new way to attract an audience and create an opportunity to  learn.  Who knows how many of the people who ride in the canoes will think twice about throwing trash or dumping in a drain.  How many will come out to plant trees the next time they hear about it.  How many will learn about re-usable water bottles.  How many will see the river when they drive over it.  The impact of this can be far reaching in immeasurable ways. </p>
<p>We know that not everyone has the cash to spend on things like this.   There are other ways you can help.  In fact, a few minutes of time that you have could end up making all the difference in the world.  If you want to help…</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey all! My name is Alexandra (Lex) and I am going to Tanzania this summer to work with a non-profit organization called HELP-International. The video above gives a good summary of the types of projects the organization works on, but my personal interest in interning/volunteering in Tanzania is because I have lived in Arusha, Tanzania before and I know firsthand the issues the people face when it comes to development and poverty eradication. It is my goal in life to be the cause of change in the international community. </p>
<p>For my fundraising, I am asking for donations that will help me pay for the program fee for the three months I will spend in Tanzania, anything extra will assist me in paying for airfare. This campaign is important to me because I am hoping to gain experience in Tanzania that will help me when I start applying to graduate school next year. </p>
<p>Contributors to this crowdfunding campaign will help me in my career goals. I am very passionate about making an impact on the world, and East Africa in particular. YOUR donation will make the difference in me being able to partake in this program. Your donation will be helping me take the steps I need to become influential in development issues. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So, to break it down, I am looking to raise at least $4,000 because that is the rough estimate of my program fee. This portion of money will go directly to HELP-International. Anything additional I raise will help me pay for my airfare.</p>
<p>For those of you who are interested in me bringing something back for you in return for your donation, I have listed perks on this page as well. Tanzania has awesome craft markets and AMAZING coffee and tea. I will be happy to bring you guys something back if you would like! Just donate through the perk section (I think that's how it works). </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This year I have seriously learned the importance of donations and generous contributions in the non-profit world. Fundraising is hard and making a difference requires a lot of outside support. That's where you guys come in. Your support in my endeavors will help me gain connections with well known non-profit organizations that work internationally. Being able to dig a well, spread awareness about HIV/AIDS. work on local business development, etc. is valuable to me because I think all people should be able to live a life like we do in America and everyone should have their basic needs met. </p>
<p>Your contribution will help me with my life goals. The last time I lived in Arusha, Tanzania, the house I was in ran out of water at least once every few days. Imagine what it's like to wake up not knowing if you have water to shower, or even to wash your hands or to drink. This is a reality for people in Arusha and many other parts of the world. By making a donation, you will be helping me gain experience working on such water projects that hopefully one day no one will have to worry about their basic needs being met or available. </p>

This forest is home to over 556 species of fauna including 4 critically endangered water bird species, Asian elephants, tigers (though they are feared extinct from this area since 2007) and the world's largest surviving populations of black-shanked duocs and yellow-cheeked gibbons. It is an area of incalculable natural value. In  2000, WCS took over protection of the forest and discovered a new population of a primate that had been feared close to extinction: the southern yellow-cheeked gibbon. Presumed the world's largest remaining population of this endangered species, these gibbons are now in need of protection from the illegal logging and poaching that have begun within the forest. Therefore, a survey is required in order to gain as much information as we can about this population. The results of the survey will provide crucial support for the protection of this entire ecosystem as well as for the further development of an eco-tourism operation run by the local village of Andong Kralong. Through scientific study and community-led conservation, we hope that this priceless biodiversity hotspot can remain a protected haven. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span></p>

Farms realizes that $20,000 seems very low considering the number of features
in our system. Because we’re asking for your help, we simply want to be humble
with the goal amount. According to our calculations, $20,000 is just enough to
build a fully functional aquaponics facility that uses a shipping container and
a large greenhouse. The vertical farming structures and stretch goals are very
important to us, but they are not necessary to construct a functional

</div></div>","An insulated shipping container houses massive fish tanks filled with organic tilapia  year-round. From this container, nutrient-rich water from the fish disperses out to a large greenhouse where state-of-the-art vertical growing techniques optimize production in a compact space.  **Self-regulation: when something is out of balance in the system, smart devices correct the imbalance automatically. Additionally, fish feeders release food on a schedule that increases serving size as the fish grow!


BUT before we can build this incredible facility, we needed to start somewhere...smaller. We needed a system as proof of concept and for valuable insight to guide our construction of the micro-farm.






We started by retrofitting large water tanks into containers for fish and plants. After assembling a wooden support structure, installing powerful LED lights and
incorporating various plumbing/electrical components, our prototype system was ready to accommodate over 200 pounds of organic Tilapia and
over 30 species of organic fruits, vegetables, and herbs.








Wouldn't it be nice if your garden could
take care of itself? Our prototype's ""Brain"" regulates LED lights,
monitors digital sensors, and moves water within the aquaponics system. The
sensors are programmed to collect water quality information and stream it to
any device with a browser. If there is an imbalance in the system, a notification is automatically sent to our mobile devices. 












Generating data that aims to maximize farming efficiency will not only help improve our system, but also help our non-profit organization secure local and federal grants. These grants will finance improvements to the system, additional facilities, publications for the scientific community, and much more.






The path to a healthier future requires that we empower people with a deep understanding of what goes into our food. That's why we've designed kindergarten through college lesson plans to teach students about aquaponic systems, anatomy, chemistry, physics, green engineering, computer programming and other important subjects. Shout out to Mrs. Wilson's 5th grade class at Denton's Wilson Elementary! 






By growing plants with a rich diversity of colors, smells, textures and flavors, our sensory garden is a place for therapy AND fun! Sensory exposure of this kind is incredibly effective for helping children with Autism and other developmental disabilities to adjust to a world full of diverse sensory experiences. 



























$26,000 = SUPER-INSULATION & VENTILATION

By installing rigid polyurethane panels around the perimeter of the greenhouse (ground level to 8 feet high), we will conserve energy and money that would otherwise be lost to temperature control. 
In addition to insulating panels, we will combine reflective paint, solar-powered turbines, automated shuttered vents and fans, compost heaters, shade cloth and other materials to minimize greenhouse climate fluctuations for more energy savings.



$35,000 = KID-FRIENDLY SCIENCE LABORATORY!!


In the spirit of education, we have designed a science laboratory that fits inside the shipping container alongside the fish tank! 
The laboratory will feature:

A window into the fish tank for the kids to spy thousands of live Tilapia. Submersible fiberoptic cameras mounted to remote-controlled submarines let them direct the exploration of entire aquatic ecosystems

<p>We have an opportunity through this project to help protect one of the most pristine wilderness left on the planet: outer Mongolia.</p>
<p>With your support, I'm raising money to donate a dirt bike to a park ranger in Mongolia so that he can protect his 94,000 acres of wilderness (holy moly, that's huge). He'll stop poaching of snow leopard and Argali sheep. He'll locate and stop illegal fishing and mining. He'll make sure construction is permitted (there is illegal development and mining right now). He'll watch over ibex, elk, wolf, wolverine, musk deer, brown bear, Siberian moose, and sable, too.</p>

    patrol 38,000 hectares (94 thousand acres) of Horidol Saridag Strictly Protected Area.</i><br/></p>

</div></div>","Hi, my name is André Angelantoni
I’d like to tell you about this incredible project in Mongolia that’s close to my heart; a project for which I’ve been training hard to complete. The issues surrounding this project need your awareness and support, so please learn more and consider making a tax deductible donation today. 

What is ""A Bike for Batdorj?""


Mongolia has an ambitious goal to preserve its beautiful land, the people and the animals that live there. 
We have an opportunity through this project to help protect one of the most pristine wilderness left on the planet: outer Mongolia.
With your support, I'm raising money to donate a dirt bike to a park ranger in Mongolia so that he can protect his 94,000 acres of wilderness (holy moly, that's huge). He'll stop poaching of snow leopard and Argali sheep. He'll locate and stop illegal fishing and mining. He'll make sure construction is permitted (there is illegal development and mining right now). He'll watch over ibex, elk, wolf, wolverine, musk deer, brown bear, Siberian moose, and sable, too.
Only native people are allowed in the Horidol Saridag Strictly Protected Area that Batdorj protects. If he finds someone who doesn't live there, they are likely up to no good!
Meet Batdorj Byambasuren, the ranger who is getting the dirt bike.


Here is a bit of how Batdorj came to be a park ranger, in his own words:


    I was born into a nomadic family and I was a herder. One time, I found an Argali sheep hidden amongst my herd of
    sheep. It was a very cold winter. I cared for the Argali until spring and let it go into the wild. Ever since, I was
    inspired to become a ranger and work to protect wildlife. I’ve been working as a ranger for 12 years now and I
    patrol 38,000 hectares (94 thousand acres) of Horidol Saridag Strictly Protected Area.

Help Me Get a Bike to Batdorj!

Buying the dirt bike and getting it to Batdorj costs $6500.
I've already bought the plane ticket to get me there ($2500; that comes out of my pocket, not what you donate).
Even if I don't reach my fundraising goal all of your donation will go to getting the bike to Mongolia. You can rest assured that the bike will get to Batdorj — no matter what.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Alaska Natives living off the land in Bristol Bay depend on the region's wild salmon runs for survival. Our documentary opens a window to Alaska Native communities facing the Pebble Partnership's plans to develop North America's biggest open pit mine at the headwaters of the world's largest salmon spawning streams. The film will premiere at the Finger Lakes Environmental Film Festival in April, 2013.</p>
<p>Traveling off the road system in small boats, the film explores how Alaska Native communities have lived symbiotically with the land, depending on the salmon for over 1,000 years. Our feature length documentary examines the current and potential future impacts of the Pebble Mine as President Obama and the Environmental Protection Agency prepare to decide on whether or not to permit the mine. They may decide as soon as November 2013.</p>

<h3>Strawberry Moon Festival <br/>
</h3>
<a href=""#Fran%C3%A7ais"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cliquez ici pour une version et vidéo francophone!</a><br/><br/><h2>Kwe, Kway, Hello, Bonjour, Ainngai, Tansi!</h2>
<p><b>50$ Early Bird tickets for sale in Perks section!  Get them while they are hot!</b>  <br/></p>
<p><b>June 21 - Solstice 2015 - <a href=""http://www.strawberrymoonfestival.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Website</a></b><br/></p>
<p>Can you remember going out to harvest strawberries in the late spring, early summer, plucking the ripe red berries from the plant, and biting into a juicy perfect piece of paradise?  Do you remember coming home, fingers stained and belly full, to make pies and jams or freeze some for winter to have them for later?  I can.</p>
<p>For many people including the First Nation people, the strawberry harvest signifies the coming of summer a cause for celebration, and the time to harvest this important fruit and medicine.    For the Mohawk people, it represents the first fruit of year, a fruit they ask the creator for during their Mid-winter ceremony.  It also holds a sacred place in all ceremony as it represents the heart of the creator.   For the Abenaki, the June
 moon is the nokahigas (the moon of hoeing), or depending on the year, 
the solstice could fall within temaskikos (the cutting grass 
moon).  Either way, the moon is central, for so many of us.<br/></p>
<p>This solstice, our <a href=""http://www.strawberrymoonfestival.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">festival </a><a href=""www.strawberrymoonfestival.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> </a>will bring together Elders and Indigenous teachers that carry with them the history of their people and the history and traditions revolving around indigenous foods &amp; medicines, the harvest and spirit.    These teachers will generously share their knowledge from the past to create visions of a future where we care for the earth, it's food sources, it's medicines and people while still harvesting abundance from our food systems.  <br/></p>
<p>Permaculture has now taken a large place in my family's life.   Many of the theories in permaculture and herbal medicine are 
based on traditional Indigenous knowledge.  This knowledge must be celebrated 
with the greater public and that is why we are looking for supporters 
like <b>YOU</b> to help us make this very first <a href=""http://www.strawberrymoonfestival.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> festival</a><a href=""http://teprine76.wix.com/strawberrymoon2015"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> </a>a huge success.  <br/>
</p>
<p>With your contribution, we will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raise funds for the logistics of the event  <br/>
</li>
<li>Pay many of the teachers for the sharing of this knowledge.  <br/>
</li>
<li>Launch a long awaited and need festival!<br/>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Financial Breakdown<br/>
</h3>
<p>Here is what we will rent with your $$ :</p>
<ul>
<li>Tents,  sound equipment, toilets, First Aid medicines, Cisterns for drinking water, Strawberries, Coffee &amp; Tea = 3000$<br/>
</li>
<li>Honorariums for the Elders and Teachers - 3000$<br/>
</li>
<li>Administration &amp; Volunteers - 2000$ <br/>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Why are we doing this?<br/>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Share the vibrant knowledge and wisdom that is vibrant within the First Nation communities <br/>
</li>
<li>Improve gardening, harvesting, agricultural and wildcrafting techniques</li>
<li>Exchange seeds</li>
<li>Foster discussion on food security, permaculture, First Nation knowledge and plant medicine <br/>
</li>
<li>Eat those wonderful strawberries at the same time.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>A challenge is nothing but success waiting to happen!<br/>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>In community work we often spend more time than we are paid to ensure that our goal is reached.  One challenge that we face is not paying our staff what they deserve because our financial goal has not been met.<br/>
</li>
<li>The solution to this is to ensure that we raise funds here and that the festival reaches a maximum amount of people - especially those willing to pay sponsorship prices (100$) to support the initiative.  <br/>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other ways to help!<br/>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you cannot support us financially, there are many other ways to help us out!  We will need volunteers for the event!  <b> <a href=""https://fr.surveymonkey.com/r/ZFW2R2W"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">We need 13 volunteers</a> </b>for 4hrs each before during and after the event and you get a ticket!  Please contact Teprine Baldo at teprine76@yahoo.ca if you are interested.  <br/>

<p><b>Billet de lève-tôt à 50$ dans section Contrepartie!  Acheter dès maintenant!<br/></b></p>
<p>Vous
souvenez-vous être allés, à la fin du printemps ou tôt en été, cueillir des
fraises, ces petits fruits rouges, juteux, bien mûrs et les déguster avec la
sensation d’être au septième ciel? Vous souvenez-vous être revenus à la maison
les doigts tachés et l’estomac bien rempli rêvant d’avance aux tartes et aux
confitures sans compter en congeler pour l’hiver suivant? Moi je m’en souviens!
</p>
<p>Pour
plusieurs personnes incluant les autochtones, la récolte des fraises, premier
petit fruit de l’année, marque l’arrivée de la saison estivale, une bonne
raison pour célébrer et cueillir ce fruit aux propriétés médicinales. Pour le
peuple Mohawk, c’est le premier fruit de l’année, fruit qu’ils ont dans toutes leurs cérémonies car elle représente le cœur du
créateur.<span>  </span></p>
<p>A l’occasion
du solstice d’été, notre<a href=""http://www.strawberrymoonfestival.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> festival </a>va rassembler les Ainés et les enseignants
autochtones qui perpétuent l’histoire de leur peuple ainsi que les traditions et
les connaissances entourant les plantes médicinales, la récolte et les
préparatifs pour la saison des semences. Ces enseignants vont partager
généreusement leurs connaissances du passé pour créer une vision d’un futur où
tous se soucieraient de la terre, des plantes médicinales et des gens tout en
bénéficiant de récoltes abondantes.</p>
<p>La ‘’permaculture’’
a maintenant prise une place importante dans la vie de ma famille. Plusieurs
des théories en ‘’permaculture’’ et plantes médicinales sont basées sur les
connaissances et traditions ancestrales des autochtones. Ces connaissances
gagnent à être célébrées avec l’ensemble de la population et c’est pour cette
raison que nous recherchons le support de personnes comme <b>VOUS </b>pour nous aider à faire de ce premier<a href=""www.strawberrymoonfestival.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.strawberrymoonfestival.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> festival </a>un grand succès.</p>

Cliquez ici pour une version et vidéo francophone!Kwe, Kway, Hello, Bonjour, Ainngai, Tansi!
50$ Early Bird tickets for sale in Perks section!  Get them while they are hot!  
June 21 - Solstice 2015 - Website
Can you remember going out to harvest strawberries in the late spring, early summer, plucking the ripe red berries from the plant, and biting into a juicy perfect piece of paradise?  Do you remember coming home, fingers stained and belly full, to make pies and jams or freeze some for winter to have them for later?  I can.
For many people including the First Nation people, the strawberry harvest signifies the coming of summer a cause for celebration, and the time to harvest this important fruit and medicine.    For the Mohawk people, it represents the first fruit of year, a fruit they ask the creator for during their Mid-winter ceremony.  It also holds a sacred place in all ceremony as it represents the heart of the creator.   For the Abenaki, the June
 moon is the nokahigas (the moon of hoeing), or depending on the year, 
the solstice could fall within temaskikos (the cutting grass 
moon).  Either way, the moon is central, for so many of us.
This solstice, our festival  will bring together Elders and Indigenous teachers that carry with them the history of their people and the history and traditions revolving around indigenous foods & medicines, the harvest and spirit.    These teachers will generously share their knowledge from the past to create visions of a future where we care for the earth, it's food sources, it's medicines and people while still harvesting abundance from our food systems.  
Permaculture has now taken a large place in my family's life.   Many of the theories in permaculture and herbal medicine are 
based on traditional Indigenous knowledge.  This knowledge must be celebrated 
with the greater public and that is why we are looking for supporters 
like YOU to help us make this very first  festival a huge success.  

With your contribution, we will:

Raise funds for the logistics of the event  

Pay many of the teachers for the sharing of this knowledge.  

Launch a long awaited and need festival!



Financial Breakdown

Here is what we will rent with your $$ :

Tents,  sound equipment, toilets, First Aid medicines, Cisterns for drinking water, Strawberries, Coffee & Tea = 3000$

Honorariums for the Elders and Teachers - 3000$

Administration & Volunteers - 2000$ 



Why are we doing this?


Share the vibrant knowledge and wisdom that is vibrant within the First Nation communities 

Improve gardening, harvesting, agricultural and wildcrafting techniques
Exchange seeds
Foster discussion on food security, permaculture, First Nation knowledge and plant medicine 

Eat those wonderful strawberries at the same time.



A challenge is nothing but success waiting to happen!


In community work we often spend more time than we are paid to ensure that our goal is reached.  One challenge that we face is not paying our staff what they deserve because our financial goal has not been met.

The solution to this is to ensure that we raise funds here and that the festival reaches a maximum amount of people - especially those willing to pay sponsorship prices (100$) to support the initiative.  



Other ways to help!


If you cannot support us financially, there are many other ways to help us out!  We will need volunteers for the event!   We need 13 volunteers for 4hrs each before during and after the event and you get a ticket!  Please contact Teprine Baldo at teprine76@yahoo.ca if you are interested.  

And you can share this with all your friends, family, lovers and strangers to on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram... to ensure that we can surpass our goal and raise money for this awesome festival. 


Thank you, Nia:wen, Meegwetch, Wliwni, Têniki, Nakurmiik

FESTIVAL LUNE DES FRAISE



Kwe, Kway, Bonjour, Ainngai, Tansi!
Le dimanche 21 juin – solstice d’été 2015 - Siteweb
Billet de lève-tôt à 50$ dans section Contrepartie!  Acheter dès maintenant!
Vous
souvenez-vous être allés, à la fin du printemps ou tôt en été, cueillir des
fraises, ces petits fruits rouges, juteux, bien mûrs et les déguster avec la
sensation d’être au septième ciel? Vous souvenez-vous être revenus à la maison
les doigts tachés et l’estomac bien rempli rêvant d’avance aux tartes et aux
confitures sans compter en congeler pour l’hiver suivant? Moi je m’en souviens!

Pour
plusieurs personnes incluant les autochtones, la récolte des fraises, premier
petit fruit de l’année, marque l’arrivée de la saison estivale, une bonne
raison pour célébrer et cueillir ce fruit aux propriétés médicinales. Pour le
peuple Mohawk, c’est le premier fruit de l’année, fruit qu’ils ont dans toutes leurs cérémonies car elle représente le cœur du
créateur.  
A l’occasion
du solstice d’été, notre festival va rassembler les Ainés et les enseignants
autochtones qui perpétuent l’histoire de leur peuple ainsi que les traditions et
les connaissances entourant les plantes médicinales, la récolte et les
préparatifs pour la saison des semences. Ces enseignants vont partager
généreusement leurs connaissances du passé pour créer une vision d’un futur où
tous se soucieraient de la terre, des plantes médicinales et des gens tout en
bénéficiant de récoltes abondantes.
La ‘’permaculture’’
a maintenant prise une place importante dans la vie de ma famille. Plusieurs
des théories en ‘’permaculture’’ et plantes médicinales sont basées sur les
connaissances et traditions ancestrales des autochtones. Ces connaissances
gagnent à être célébrées avec l’ensemble de la population et c’est pour cette
raison que nous recherchons le support de personnes comme VOUS pour nous aider à faire de ce premier festival un grand succès.
Avec votre support, nous pourrons :


Lever les fonds nécessaires aux besoins logistiques de cet événement

Rémunérer les enseignants pour le partage de leurs connaissances 

Lancer un festival qui est en grand demande!







Modalités financières :
Avec les
argents amassés, nous prévoyons :


Louer tentes, système de son, toilettes portables, trousses de premiers
soins, réservoirs d’eau potable et aussi acheter fraises, thé et café, le tout
pour une valeur totale de $3,000.

Rémunérer les Invités $3,000

Couvrir les frais d’administration $2,000


Buts de ce festival :


Partager les connaissances et la sagesse qui sont vibrantes dans les
communautés autochtones et ‘’permaculture’’. 

Améliorer et approfondir les techniques de jardinage, d’agriculture et de 'wildcrafting' i.e. la pratique
de la récolte des plantes dans leur habitat naturel comme nourriture ou à des
fins médicinales.
Échanger des semences.
Favoriser le dialogue en matière de sécurité alimentaire, de permaculture,
des connaissances des gens des Premières Nations et des plantes médicinales.

Savourer des fraises !

Un défi n’est qu’un succès en devenir !


En travail communautaire, les personnes travaillent fort et souvent
bénévolement pour atteindre leur objectif. Un défi auquel nous faisons face est
de ne pas pouvoir rémunérer correctement notre personnel parce que notre
objectif financier n’a pas été atteint.

L’objectif principal à ce stade-ci est d’amasser suffisamment de fonds, ici,
dans notre milieu et de faire en sorte que le festival rejoigne le plus grand
nombre possible de personnes – particulièrement ceux prêts à parrainer cette
initiative avec un don de $100.

Autres façons d’aider !


Bénévolat : nous aurons besoin de plusieurs volontaires il va sans
dire, pour la mise en place et le bon déroulement de l’événement.  Nous avons besoins de 13 bénévoles pour l'événement - 4 hrs chaque et vous auriez un billet!  Si vous voulez, contacter Teprine Baldo à teprine76@yahoo.ca.


Partage : vous pouvez également partager la tenue de ce festival avec
vos parents, vos proches, vos amis, et même des inconnus sur Facebook, Twitter,
Instagram…. dans le but de surpasser nos objectifs et de récolter le plus de
fonds possible pour ce fabuleux festival.

</div></div>","Empower over 14,000 refugees across Greece! 



Elpis means hope. Our mission is to provide refugees with free solar-power to charge their mobile devices on Greek islands and mainland. 


Greece is struggling with an influx of over 850,000 refugees, with more than 155,000 arriving this year. Imagine leaving behind all you have ever known, and being left with only one way to contact your family, transfer money and access key information. Suddenly what just seemed like a phone has become a lifeline. 

 Nowadays almost everyone owns a smartphone, but for refugees access to electricity can be limited, especially on arrival. 

Access to electricity is very limited in camps and while travelling. Refugees are faced with little choice but to continue to look for alternatives, not hesitating to take dangerous risks in order to do so.
              This is how refugees need to charge their devices right now:

Together we can change this! 


We have designed a solar-charging station that will provide refugees with a sustainable source of electricity.




The Solar-Charger will be built in collaboration with Entec, a Greek solar technology company and its partners; Solar World, Steca Elektronik and Viosy S.A. This unit is configured to generate electricity for 12 plugs per hour using only the sun. We are aiming to run the Solar-Charger for 10 hours a day, delivering electricity to 3600 refugees in just 1 month. Due to its scalability, Project Elpis has the potential to expand to different locations in Greece, Europe and the Middle East.       



We showcase a fully sustainable model by addressing social, economic and environmental issues as we bring green electricity to refugees in Greece. 

Society: Refugees can live more independently from community resources, improving coexistence with locals and reducing tensions between the two. Economy: The solar-unit does not connect to the electricity grid, reducing energy expenditures while providing free and accessible energy to all who need it.Environment: People need to communicate with family and access information. Our design offers a renewable and environmentally viable way of doing so.





With your help we can make this happen!

Your contribution will allow migrants to access a much-needed opportunity to seek out travel advice whilst also enabling communication with family and friends back home.

Dependable information empowers people in crises and aids in clarifying rumors, reducing confusion, stress and susceptibility to fraud.  


Therefore refugees will be able to make better-informed decisions for themselves and their families for a better chance of resettlement.   


You will also help refugees in safeguarding their most cherished memories that are often documented on their mobile phones; offering them hope in the darkest moments.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I feel lucky to have been selected to participate in the <a href=""https://homewardboundprojects.com.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Homeward Bound</a> initiative. 2016 is the first year of a ten year program to build a 1,000 strong global collaboration of women in science. </p>
<p>When I went to Antarctica 20 years ago to lead a civilian cleanup we knew Antarctica was significant as it regulates global climate and contains the majority of ice, fresh water and our climate history in its ice cores.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Your contribution of any size is so appreciated. You will help me be a better leader, collaborator, advocate, actor. I will be grateful to tell you more about what I, we learn and do. </p>
<ul>
<li>Each participant must raise US$ 15000 (not including flights, insurance and accommodation en route). I'm contributing minimum $5000. Significant in-kind contributions have been made and underwritten by <a href=""http://www.dattnergrant.com.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dattner Grant</a> (management consulting company organising this program) and its partners. Full program cost per person is A$40,000.</li>
<li><p>The perks are varied and customized for you! Pitch me a perk and I'll consider too! Want me to speak to your group? A postcard from the end of the world? In-kind donation?</p></li>
<li><p>If I don't reach my entire goal, the costs will offset a portion raised towards to cost. </p></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Objectives &amp; Impact</h3>
<p><strong>Project Objectives:</strong></p>
<p>•To elevate each participant’s leadership capabilities.</p>
<p>•To educate the team on the science of what is happening to our planet.</p>
<p>•To refine participants’ skills to design and execute strategy, and to create plans for future collaborations as women working towards a sustainable future.</p>
<p>•To enhance these skills, over 10-years, with 1000 women networked and skilled to affect change.</p>
<p>•To create active, non-hierarchical collaborations among women in small groups and as a collective.</p>
<p><strong>To have a global focus</strong></p>
<p>To contribute to and elevate the <a href=""http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2016/07/29/female-scientists-will-brave-antarctica-in-winter-for-stem-leadership-camp/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">broader societal conversation</a> (see it written up in New York TImes) about the role of women in leading the world toward a more sustainable future.</p>
<p><strong>Why Women:</strong></p>
<p>•Globally, women are underrepresented in leadership positions and change has been incredibly slow, despite increasing dialogue and process/systems changes</p>
<p>•Women are emerging from college degrees as significant percentages of graduates and they take up a significant percentage of our workforce. However, they are in the profound minority globally when it comes to executive decision-making roles.</p>
<p>•By giving women the leadership and strategic skills, a sound understanding of the science, and a strong purposefully developed network they will be able to impact policy and decisions towards a sustainable future.</p>
<p><strong>How</strong>: </p>
<p>•At sea for twenty days, led by <a href=""http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/outdoor/adventure/2016/03/profile-greg-mortimer"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Greg Mortimer OAM</a>, sailing from Ushuaia Argentina on Dec 2nd, 2016</p>
<p>•Twelve days of state of the art leadership and strategic planning training </p>
<p>•Six days of a cutting edge science education program incorporating the most up to date and relevant research about the state and functioning of our planet delivered by leading academics.</p>
<p>Homeward Bound benefits from globally recognised people of influence, including Dr Jane Goodall, Primatologist and environmental activist, Franny Armstrong, one of the world’s 100 most influential women, Sylvia Earle, famous marine ecologist and celebrated activist with Mission Blue, Dr Susan David, Co-Founder and Director of the Institute of Coaching, Harvard A-lister, Dr Robert Kaplan and Dave Norton – developed strategy mapping, balanced score card.</p>
<p>It's not only leadership learning and work in Antarctica: Since late last year, we have worked projects such as education outreach, climate science communication and women as changemakers . We have also explored leadership to promote transformational change.</p>
<p>•A documentary (60 minute multi media release) is being made, following the journey and exploring the role of women in our world.</p>
<p>Homeward Bound is the brainchild of renowned leadership expert <a href=""http://www.dattnergrant.com.au/Who_We_Are/Meet_The_Team/Fabian_Dattner.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fabian Dattner</a>, a magic collaboration with Dr. Jess Melbourne‐Thomas from the <a href=""http://acecrc.org.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre.</a></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I risk not raising the full amount to offset my costs to participate but I will persevere as I'm committed to being on Homeward Bound. I have the potential to extend this campaign if required.</p>
<p>The weather in Antarctica may be a barrier to accomplish all we hope such as visits to scientific stations but having led expeditions before, I know that mother nature rules and you  be adaptive, sensible and lateral in your approach to do what you need to do. I trust the highly experienced Homeward Bound leader Fabian and ship expedition leader Greg Mortimer.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people can't contribute, but you can still help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please help get the word out and make some noise about my campaign.</li>
<li>You can use the Indiegogo share tools!</li>
<li>Get or keep involved however you can with initiatives to use carbon-alternates, to reduce plastic use and footprint</li>
<li>Learn or share more about the value of supporting women in STEM and leadership, protecting our planet, the poles </li>
<li>Keep being a great neighbour!</li>
</ul>

Each participant must raise US$ 15000 (not including flights, insurance and accommodation en route). I'm contributing minimum $5000. Significant in-kind contributions have been made and underwritten by Dattner Grant (management consulting company organising this program) and its partners. Full program cost per person is A$40,000.
The perks are varied and customized for you! Pitch me a perk and I'll consider too! Want me to speak to your group? A postcard from the end of the world? In-kind donation?
If I don't reach my entire goal, the costs will offset a portion raised towards to cost. 


The Objectives & Impact
Project Objectives:
•To elevate each participant’s leadership capabilities.
•To educate the team on the science of what is happening to our planet.
•To refine participants’ skills to design and execute strategy, and to create plans for future collaborations as women working towards a sustainable future.
•To enhance these skills, over 10-years, with 1000 women networked and skilled to affect change.
•To create active, non-hierarchical collaborations among women in small groups and as a collective.
To have a global focus
To contribute to and elevate the broader societal conversation (see it written up in New York TImes) about the role of women in leading the world toward a more sustainable future.
Why Women:
•Globally, women are underrepresented in leadership positions and change has been incredibly slow, despite increasing dialogue and process/systems changes
•Women are emerging from college degrees as significant percentages of graduates and they take up a significant percentage of our workforce. However, they are in the profound minority globally when it comes to executive decision-making roles.
•By giving women the leadership and strategic skills, a sound understanding of the science, and a strong purposefully developed network they will be able to impact policy and decisions towards a sustainable future.
How: 
•At sea for twenty days, led by Greg Mortimer OAM, sailing from Ushuaia Argentina on Dec 2nd, 2016
•Twelve days of state of the art leadership and strategic planning training 
•Six days of a cutting edge science education program incorporating the most up to date and relevant research about the state and functioning of our planet delivered by leading academics.
Homeward Bound benefits from globally recognised people of influence, including Dr Jane Goodall, Primatologist and environmental activist, Franny Armstrong, one of the world’s 100 most influential women, Sylvia Earle, famous marine ecologist and celebrated activist with Mission Blue, Dr Susan David, Co-Founder and Director of the Institute of Coaching, Harvard A-lister, Dr Robert Kaplan and Dave Norton – developed strategy mapping, balanced score card.
It's not only leadership learning and work in Antarctica: Since late last year, we have worked projects such as education outreach, climate science communication and women as changemakers . We have also explored leadership to promote transformational change.
•A documentary (60 minute multi media release) is being made, following the journey and exploring the role of women in our world.
Homeward Bound is the brainchild of renowned leadership expert Fabian Dattner, a magic collaboration with Dr. Jess Melbourne‐Thomas from the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre.

Risks & Challenges
I risk not raising the full amount to offset my costs to participate but I will persevere as I'm committed to being on Homeward Bound. I have the potential to extend this campaign if required.
The weather in Antarctica may be a barrier to accomplish all we hope such as visits to scientific stations but having led expeditions before, I know that mother nature rules and you  be adaptive, sensible and lateral in your approach to do what you need to do. I trust the highly experienced Homeward Bound leader Fabian and ship expedition leader Greg Mortimer.

Other Ways You Can Help
Some people can't contribute, but you can still help:

Please help get the word out and make some noise about my campaign.
You can use the Indiegogo share tools!
Get or keep involved however you can with initiatives to use carbon-alternates, to reduce plastic use and footprint

</ul></div>","Short SummaryAthletes For Clean Air  (AFCA) is a non-profit Utah entity comprised of athletes and outdoor professionals dedicated to cleaning Utah's dangerous and polluted air.Our #365DaysOfEarth campaign is geared towards making everyday Earth Day by promoting and instituting healthy, simple lifestyle practices that will benefit Earth and her environment.  This campaign is a multi-pronged approach at raising  public awareness about environmental responsibility and action.The Tree Planting Project will enable the purchase and installation  of hundreds of trees and planting materials  throughout Salt Lake City to help combat the insidious carbon dioxide-laden air and our dangerous levels of ozone pollution that exist inside of our basin-structured geography. The trees planted will also serve as a reminder to citizens, corporations and government that action can be and is being taken; every single person can make a difference. What We Need & What You GetWe're asking for $5000 as a watermark for funding. Is it a lot? Yes. Because we need more trees! Every penny will go towards trees and planting material, and not a penny less. In fact, our founders have already started the effort by purchasing and donating their own equipment  to move forward. By donating to our fundraising campaign, you enable the purchase and planting of more than 100 trees, and help ensure cleaner air for Utah and her citizens, as well as better health for the environment and its many creature residents. No matter how much we raise, every penny will go towards the tree project and planting as many trees as possible... Every cent. So whether it's $50 or all $5000, we're hell bent on clearing our air! Whatever you donate will be used solely for trees and planting material, and in exchange for your generous donation, we'll put your name on our list of 'Game Changers' on our #365DaysOfEarth page as a thank you! The ImpactNew trees now, clean air forever... And an impact to last just as long. By donating to our Tree Planting Project now, you're creating a better future not just for today, but for years to come.

<h2>
<strong><span>About </span></strong><strong><span>Roșia Montană</span></strong>
</h2>
<p>Located in a green valley in the Carpathians, in the Transylvania region, the village tells a more than 2000 - year history, as it is the oldest documented mining settlement in Romania. And the history continues to be written today. Not only beauty and age characterizes this place – but it’s also one big treasure: Europe’s largest gold reserve.</p>
<p>The Transylvanian village is placed in an incredibly valuable gold mining area, and therefore the right for exploitation of the gold reserve of Rosia has been concessioned by Rosia Montana Gold Corporation (RMGC) since 1997. RMGC represents a joint venture between the Canadian mining company Gabriel Resources as major shares holder (80%) and the Romanian state (20%). The plan of the company is to destroy 4 mountains and a large part of the village in order to establish a cyanide lake &amp; mining waste deposits – with massive and not foreseeable consequences for nature and people.</p>
<p>The Romanian state claims that this project – at a time of global economic crisis - will bring thousands of jobs and immediate gains of up to 4 billion US dollars.</p>
<p><span> On the other hand, a part of the local community opposes this project for over 10 years – in the firm belief that the true treasure of the region is not its gold.</span></p>
<p>In the year of 2000 about 40 Romanian NGOs gathered for the first time in Rosia Montana and issued a joint statement against the proposed project.</p>
<p><span>This was the birth of the “Save Rosia Montana” campaign – today the strongest civic protest movement in Romania. This opposition is based on diverse cultural, social, environmental and economic arguments. </span></p>

<h2><strong>GOAL</strong></h2>
<p>The main goal of this solidarity tour is to open people’s minds and hearts – on the one hand for Rosia Montana – on the other to connect people with environmental and social consciousness from the countries where we’ll travel in Europe.</p>
<p>Besides the cultural exchange, the focus of our project is clearly the promotion of democracy, civic education and civil society networking.</p>
<p>With the tour we pursue:</p>
<p>- to affirm the idea of Europe with a bottom up approach<br/>- to create awareness of environmental issues<br/>- to spread of information about the proposed gold project<br/>- to actively support the Save Rosia Montana Campaign</p>
<p>We want to get the ball rolling, to take a stand, gain international attention and thus boost the tourism in the area.<br/>It is not only the problem of a small village somewhere in the Romanian Apuseni mountains. It’s about human rights, environment protection and democracy. Especially since Romania is part of the European Union, it is the responsibility of each of us to show solidarity.</p>

<div class=""template asset""> </div></div>","Archo was born and lives in the forest.  He is a simple, kindhearted soul and lives a simple life.  He loves his forest, and wants to keep it clean.  But then one day he sees Arsho dancing in a traveling circus with her friend Titer the butterfly fluttering around her, and everything changes.  Archo's sidekick Meghu whispers well intention-ed advice in his ear, but he has his own ambitions, too!
Gargar the dirty crow likes garbage, but soon his life, too, is turned upside down when he stumbles across Archo, Arsho and their friends.
This film is to be sculpted in Armenia, where few educational animated TV series have been produced since independence in 1993.  We have pulled in Vrej Kassouny, one of Armenia's foremost animators to do this groundbreaking work in order to help the smallest kids of the world learn to keep the environment clean.
The goal of the project is to produce a 9 minute TV episode that will serve as a springboard for a series of 24 episodes to be produced and broadcast later.  The interest for the series is already high around the world.  This first episode will open the flood gates, breaking into international markets and festivals. 
Homegrown Armenian animation, environmental awareness and imagination that will reach out to the world.

Archo the Bear wants a clean environment!

Arsho is a dancing bear in the traveling circus

Meghu the Bumble Bee is Archo's best friend!

Titer is Arsho's sidekick!

Gargar likes his garbage!
 
and Djandj, the camera shy fly!  Djaaaandj, where are you?
 
You can secure one, two or ALL of these characters as perks during this campaign.  Each of them is handcrafted by the ladies of the Berd Women's Resource Center Foundation in Berd, the setting of the animated series.
 
So get the word out!  Archo and Arsho with friends need to shape a young Armenian generation to take care of the incredible natural beauty of their homeland.  Share this campaign with all your friends!",5.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>My name is Joneve Murphy. I am an organic farmer. I started
my career over 11 years ago, and never looked back.  There is no feeling like expending your
energy and labor to nourish others.  My first farming position was at Green Meadows Farm in South Hamilton, Massachusetts. We ran a CSA and I started a wholesale business,
selling food to restaurants in the greater Boston Area.  I then moved on to manage 6 acres for The Inn
at Shelburne Farms in Shelburne Vermont.  After that I moved down to the DC area and
grew for Ayrshire Farm in Upperville Virginia. 
I am now the farmer for The Inn at Little Washington; a double 5 star
restaurant in the foothills of the Blueridge mountains in Virginia. </p>

I have worked with farmers growing rice, turmeric and other spices, fruit and vegetables. These excursions were always something that I just did for myself, a way to take a break from the responsibilities of my own land, but still engage in growing food.  That is about to change.<br/></p><h2><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">About My Project:</span></h2><p></p><p>I am launching a new project in June called Farmer Seeking Roots. I plan to travel through Europe, Asia and South America for one year volunteering on farms and following the food home with a consumer to cook, eat and share recipes. I will explore many avenues of sustainable agriculture; family farms, cooperatives, school gardens, community gardens, pastured animals, urban farms and many more. I want to labor alongside the multitude of ardent family farmers in both developed and developing nations. I hope to share growing techniques, new varieties, and recipes, but also I want to share their passion.  I want to highlight these farmers and consumers for the important decisions they make about food every day. I want to have a conversation with both farmers and consumers about their choices to support sustainable agriculture from either side of the plate. </p><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">    </span><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/422917/files/20140309221921-campaign.jpg?1394428761"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Tea Plantations in Munnar, India<p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/422949/files/20140309223836-19tumeric.jpg?1394429916"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em; cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>Tumeric Harvest, Navdanya Farm, Uttaranchal, India<p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/422977/files/20140309225034-Joneve_s_trip_to_Nam_and_Cambodia_101.jpg?1394430634"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Rice Paddies, Sapa, Vietnam<p></p><h2><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Why This Project is Important and What I Hope to Achieve:</span></h2>
<p>I hope that through sharing these conversations I can
inspire others to grow and eat organically and sustainably. I hope to share
techniques that I find with other farmers, in an effort to further their food
enterprises. I want to encourage others to support their local farmers and food
producers, to grow something towards their own nutrition and the nourishment of
their community. We live in a world dominated by Industrial agriculture,
environmental degradation, and chemically laced foods. A world where the act of
going to the grocery store has become an act of fear and guilt for many. We
live in a world where the “experts” say that this monoculture cropping, antibiotic
plumping, industrialized, polluting, chemical and factory based farming is the
only way we are going to feed the growing population of this planet.  I want to prove them wrong.  I want to highlight farmers that are growing
food in such a way so as to rebuild their soils, improve the local environment
and engage with their communities. I want to highlight farmers and consumers
that are creating and contributing to a movement much larger than themselves.
Organic, sustainable, family farming is what is going to feed our world. People
that engage with their land, that work to see it and the land surrounding
flourish.  Our personal health is dependent
on the health of the soil, the forests, the oceans, the animals and people that
surround us. We can no longer be insular in our decisions about food.  We vote with our dollars more often and more impactfully than any of our votes at the ballot box. We, as a global community must
support enterprises and people that are furthering the sustainable food
movement.</p>
<p>I will share this journey; the triumphs, struggles and the people

<h2>Where Your Contribution Will Go:</h2>
<p>I have saved 10K towards this project, and I am going to go,
regardless of what I raise here.  However
that 10K is not enough to do the trip that I really want to do.  Your contributions will help me to include
Europe on this journey.  It will also
help me to travel for the entire year. 
There are many costs to consider; plane tickets and overland travel,
food in between farms, health insurance, maintaining and updating the website,
data charges, hiring translators and much more. 
I am doing everything I can to do this on the cheap.  I’m hoping that most farms will trade me room
and board for my labor.  I will use
couchsurfers, friends (old and new), and hostels for places to stay in between
farms.  I am all in on this project. I am
selling everything I own, and I am putting my entire savings account into this.
Please consider donating and helping me to bring this important project to
light. </p>
<p>We can change our food system.  We can vote for what we want our future to be. </p><p></p><blockquote>Thank you for your interest in my project. Please remember that no contribution is too small! If you cannot contribute financially, please help by sharing, tweeting and generally spreading the word about my project to anyone that may be interested. If you can contribute, Great! Please share my project with your friends and tell them why you were motivated to donate. </blockquote><h2><b>Perks:</b></h2><h4><span>Included

<p><strong>A Himalayan Backpacking Adventure</strong></p>
<p>Hey everyone, Caleb here. Make sure to watch the video first before you read this.</p>
<p>Life update, I have enrolled in a 35 day Himalaya backpacking course with the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS), and I need some help covering the cost of the tuition. </p>
<p>I know that I have asked for money in the past, previously raising money for Invisible Children's Schools for Schools program in 2011, and when I became a full-time volunteer with Invisible Children in 2012; and I am incredibly grateful to the many people who have given funds in the past. I was very cautious about asking for funds for my next adventure, and honestly feel very awkward doing so because of all the amazing support I have received; but I am only doing so because without your help this won't be possible.</p>
<p>When I enrolled into this program I knew that I would be able to make enough money over the course of the summer to fund the tuition but I didn't know that the tuition is due 75 days in advance and now I've hit a bump in the road. This course will be challenging but the backpacking and mountaineering training that I receive will be vital to film projects that I plan to do in the future. Now I was almost about to ditch the idea and give up on this trip until next year but after talking to a few friends I have decided to open an invitation to friends and family who would like to support me.</p>
<p>I realize that not everybody will get the chance to backpack through the incredible Himalaya Mountains in India, so I decided to put this up because I want to share this experience with as many people as possible. I have set up a reward system so that you can be involved in my adventure, and I will be setting up a blog to document my journey every step of the way.</p>
<p><strong>What I Need</strong></p>
<p>Alright, I am a planner, so this is going to be very detailed... here we go.</p>
<p>The cost of my tuition is <strong>$7,759.40</strong> (this includes tuition, equipment deposit and tuition protection)</p>
<ul>
<li>I have received a $1,000 scholarship bringing my total to <strong>$6,759.40.</strong>
</li>
<li>Tuition is due July 8th, 2013, which only gives me two and a half months to earn money. I am estimating that I will be able to provide $4,000 by July 8th so that means I need <strong>$2,759.40 </strong>by the deadline.</li>
<li>Now there are many expenses on top of this tuition. There is the cost of plane tickets, round trip estimated to be $1,300-$1,600 depending on when I buy them.</li>
<li>Actual equipment costs (I plan to rent a majority of it) will range from $1,200-$1,800.</li>
<li>Then there is the cost of miscellaneous items such as a Passport ($180), Rosetta Stone for Hindi ($180-$320) visa fees (estimated $200), GoPro camera ($200-$400) and small Nikon camera ($150) to document the trip as well as a small portable backpack solar panel so that I can keep these things charged ($60).</li>
<li>*I am still checking on which ones I need to update* Vaccines and immunizations are optional but highly recommended and crazy expensive. Hepatitis A ($282), Hepatitis B ($381), Japanese Encephalitis ($600), Typhoid ($86), Polio vaccine ($74), Yellow Fever (TBD) and optional recommended Rabies ($900) and $50 consultation. For a total of around $2373, yikes.</li>
<li>After almost everything (not including tuition and vaccines) my expenses will come to <strong>$3470-$4530</strong>. The money that I make between July 8th and the course start date on September 21st will pay for these expenses. I am cutting this budget very close so any money raised over my goal of <strong>$2,759.40</strong> will go towards these additional expenses.</li>
<li>Special note on my budget, if I don't raise enough funds I have worked it out with my bank to be able to take out a loan so even if the project is only half funded I will still make the trip. If India becomes dangerous to travel to or if something causes me not to go I will either re-schedule the trip for next year or refund the money 100% via check or PayPal.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What You Get</strong></p>
<p>I don't know how many of you will ever be able to backpack through the Himalayas so I want to bring this experience as close to your life as possible. This is why I chose to do a reward system; each reward is meant to be very intentional, and I'm excited to share them.</p>
<p>I will also be documenting my journey through a blog. I've got to start training for my 120-mile hike, and that starts now. Expect to see the blog up and running very soon which will show my preparations and cover my hike (updated after I return).</p>
<p>*The thank you notes will ship before my trip but all other rewards will be sent after my return in Octobor.</p>
<p><strong>My Hike</strong></p>
This hike is actually going to be pretty crazy. During the hike we will cover 95-120 <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/758433/pictures/full/20130415134451-Screen_shot_2013-04-15_at_4.29.13_PM.jpg?1366058698"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>miles while carrying 40%-45% of our body weight. We will be camping for over two weeks at an altitude of over 10,000 ft. and will attempt crossing of snow covered passes over 13,000 ft. gaining and losing 3,000 ft of elevation on some days.. We will cross whitewater river, scramble across teetering boulders and sweat our way up mountain passes. Between New Delhi and the mountains temperatures can vary from 100 to 0 degrees Fahrenheit.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It starts with an overnight train journey from New Delhi, followed by a three-hour Jeep ride to reach NOLS India Base at Ranikhet. We will rest, pack up and continue by bus to the village of Lohajang. We have two choices in routes, which will be determined by the weather. We might enter the Milam Valleys and continue to the <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/758432/pictures/full/20130415134443-Screen_shot_2013-04-15_at_4.28.50_PM.jpg?1366058688"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>roadhead Munsiari along well traveled trails which was an important link in the ancient trade routes between India and Tibet.

The alternative route from Lohajang traverses around the west side of the Trishul massif before crossing Kuari Pass.

<div> </div>
<div>We will return to NOLS India base by the evening of the third to last day to clean and store equipment. The next day will be spent de-issuing gear and packing personal bags.

After graduation dinner the course is over but I will plan on staying two extra days in India to travel to Agra and see the Taj Mahal. Then back on a plane to the US on the 27th-ish to get ready for my 21st birthday on the 31st here in the states, woohoo!</div>
<div>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>There are so many different reasons why I'm choosing to take on this experience.</p>
<p>I have had some incredible opportunities in life to explore new things and push myself outside my comfort zone. This is a unique opportunity that is unlike anything I have done before. This experience will immerse me into a lot of the culture; it will allow me to learn the language, eat the food, live with the people and learn their way of life. NOLS is the only organization in the world that takes students to the Himalayas, and I don't think there will be any other opportunities in my life that will lead me to the Himalayas, which makes this so exciting.</p>
<p>The other major motivation behind this is for the backpacking and mountaineering training that I will be receiving. As many of you know I have a passion for film and I have also always had a passion for the outdoors. As I venture further into independent filmmaking I would like to make the subject of my videos the pure beauty of nature. I want to showcase what this world has to offer for a worldwide audience. My NOLS training will give me the education, knowledge and ability to safely travel and hike to any spot so that I can get the perfect shots that will hopefully inspire people to spend more of their time outside. My biggest inspiration has come from a Youtuber named Devin Graham <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/devinsupertramp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Devin's Youtube Channel"">http://www.youtube.com/user/devinsupertramp</a>. If you check out his channel you will get a better idea of what I mean. He also posted a fantastic video explaining what he does which I will link here <a href=""http://youtu.be/62CUg45lMtQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://youtu.be/62CUg45lMtQ</a></p>
<p>Also here is a small peek into the Overview Effect as mentioned in the video (this will influence a lot of the blog) <a href=""http://ekostories.com/2013/04/11/planetary-collective-overview/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://ekostories.com/2013/04/11/planetary-collective-overview/</a></p>
<p>Last but not least I will be receiving 6 semester credit hours from the University of Utah, yay education!</p>

<p>This campaign will be up and running for a little over a month, so if you can't contribute now but can later that is totally fine.</p>
<p>If you aren't able to contribute, you can also help by sharing it with some of your friends and Indiegogo makes it super easy.</p>

Empowering Youth Leaders in Environmental Conservation 

The Challenge:
Paraguay is a nation rich in environmental resources, notable especially for migratory bird populations, diverse wildlife and some of the last remaining stands of tropical Atlantic Forest. Yet much of the country's environment is under threat by development, deforestation, over-hunting and grazing, and other environmentally damaging practices. Many Paraguayans recognize these problems and are seeking ways to take action to preserve, replenish, and sustainably manage their country's natural resources.
The Opportunity:
While Paraguay is environmentally rich, its best resource is its people. With over half of the population under the age of 25, Paraguayan youth are shaping the future of their country and its impact on the world. By providing young Paraguayans with the tools and guidance, we can foster a new generation of informed and dedicated young leaders to pioneer and inspire a movement of environmental sustainability and stewardship across the country. 

The Plan:
A Todo Pulmon, a Paraguayan NGO, and Peace Corps Paraguay will host the third Paraguay Verde National Youth Camp in February 2014. By bringing together over 70 youth from across the nation, young Paraguayans will have the opportunity to learn more about environmental problems in Paraguay, share ideas and collaborate on solutions for their respective communities. The camp provides a national platform for young Paraguayans to discuss local issues and share strategies for solutions in a fun and empowering atmosphere. Youth return to their communities capable of starting or enhancing an environmental youth group or implementing an action plan. Paraguay Verde also provides the opportunity for youth to develop a dialogue on environmental themes, promoting their inclusion in the local and national discourse around Paraguay’s sustainable future.                                    
Successes:
The fantastic successes of the past three Paraguay Verde youth camps, held in February 2012, October 2012, and May 2013 has led to a network of youth leaders already hard at work across Paraguay.  New environmental youth groups are being formed and many communities are organizing environmental events, such as tree plantings. Over 200 Paraguayan youth attended the past two camps where they strengthened leadership skills, met other young environmental leaders from across the country, learned about global and national environmental issues, and developed action plans to tackle these issues in their own communities. 
During the past three camps Paraguayan youth planted over 200 native tree species, participated in youth leadership panels, practiced worm composting, and made eco-bricks, plastic bottles filled with inorganic waste like plastic bags and Styrofoam, to demonstrate more sustainable and economically beneficial methods of waste and resource management.
After attending a Paraguay Verde camp, one group carried out a campaign to collect 100 kilos of batteries at their schools while educating their peers about the potential contamination caused by disposing the batteries in the nearby wetlands. Another group used the eco-bricks they learned to make during a Paraguay Verde camp to build wall out of eco-bricks outside the community’s health post.
How you can help:
We need your support to put our plan into action! Your contribution will go directly towards funding the fourth Paraguay Verde camp for the 70 youth expected to come. It only takes $75 to sponsor one youth for the duration of the camp, enabling young environmental leaders who may otherwise be unable to attend, to participate in this transformative experience!  The youth themselves will also be contributing to their experience by fundraising locally to cover transportation expenses to the camp.
You can also help us by sharing this campaign on social media and with your family and friends. Thank you for your support and for helping to promote a sustainable future, in Paraguay and beyond.https://www.facebook.com/atodopulmonparaguayhttps://www.facebook.com/CampamentoParaguayVerde

Wolves</b></h1><p><b>As you read this, wolves in British Columbia, Canada are being shot at by hunters in helicopters. </b></p><p>This is an ill-conceived plan to save endangered caribou in B.C..  The wolves are not responsible for the dwindling caribou numbers; habitat loss and human encroachment are. But wolves are taking the blame and paying the price. </p><p><b>You can help.</b></p><p>Pacific Wild Alliance, a leading wildlife conservation organization with a long track record of successful conservation achievements needs your support to put a stop to this barbaric wolf kill program.  We hope to raise $50,000 to provide a full-time campaigner with the resources to build local and international public pressure by exposing this wolf kill program as the unethical, inhumane and scientifically indefensible slaughter that it is through advertising, media and a host of other public outreach platforms. </p><p>Funding will also go towards logistical support to document the current cull program directly - it is critical that the helicopter-based killing is recorded.<br/></p><p><b>B.C. Wolves need your help.</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1167824/files/20150122142701-standforwolves.jpg?1421965621"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b>The Issue</b></p><p>•  Decades of habitat destruction and human encroachment have left B.C.’s woodland caribou in serious decline. But instead of protecting critical habitat, such as lichen-rich high elevation forests, the B.C. government turned a deaf ear to scientific warnings and allowed logging, industrial exploration and other kinds of human encroachment to take place. Now that the caribou are almost gone, they’ve decided to scapegoat wolves. These highly social and intelligent animals, icons of B.C.’s natural heritage, should not be killed because of long-term government negligence in regards to habitat protection.</p><p>•   If the wolf kill program is allowed to continue, thousands of wolves will die a cruel and unnecessary death resulting in an ecosystem imbalance and loss of genetic diversity.   Don’t let that happen. Help us fight for the wolves' right to live.</p><p><b>What We Need </b></p><p><b>•  </b> With donated advertising space, we are bringing this issue directly to the streets of Vancouver and Victoria where the wolf kill decision is ultimately made.   Help us make use of this valuable space.  Your donation will go to increasing advertising exposure in addition to production and design costs. </p><p>•   Your support will help fund a full-time wolf campaign team with the means to build local and international public pressure by exposing this kill as unscientific and ineffective through a variety of media, including film, and a host of other public outreach platforms. </p><p>•  Your support will ensure that wolves currently being killed now do not die in vain and that a long term solution that addresses the fundamental issue of habitat loss becomes the solution for the future of caribou in British Columbia. <br/></p><p>
</p><p>With the Save B.C. Wolves Indiegogo campaign
funds, we are supporting ground crews in the field actively who are actively
working to document the kill program.  We are designing ads for a new
public campaign that will bring this issue front and centre to British
Columbians. <br/></p>

You can help shine a light on this wildlife tragedy and be part of the solution.  We have a team in place to tackle the front-lines of this issue, but they can only begin with your donations. </p><p>•   There are solutions that do not result in intelligent, highly social animals being slaughtered in inhumane ways.  For example, winter-based motorized activity, one of the leading causes of caribou decline in the Selkirk mountains should be restricted from operating in endangered caribou habitat.  Traditionally, deep snow would provide security from wolves but the tracks made by vehicles allow wolves easy access to caribou. The B.C. government has known this for decades but has consistently capitulated to industry and recreational lobby groups who want access to this critical habitat.  Same story for logging, mining, and oil and gas companies - they continue to be granted access to lands that are critical for the survival of woodland caribou. </p><p>•  If we are silent nothing will change.  The success of this fundraising campaign will allow us to  build enough pressure on government, through a concerted, strategic and informed public education campaign that the widespread killing of wolves will become a sad chapter in our history.<b> </b></p><p><b><b>Who Pacific Wild Alliance is </b></b></p><p>Pacific Wild Alliance a B.C. non-profit organization committed to defending  wildlife and their habitat in Canada.  We work with a diverse array of communities, First Nations, groups and individuals to ensure that biodiversity protection is at the forefront of land and marine use decisions. </p><p>•  Pacific Wild has a long track record of carrying out successful wildlife protection campaigns that involve science-informed, creative and result-based efforts.</p><p>•  Find out more about our initiatives and team at <a href=""http://www.pacificwild.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.pacificwild.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.pacificwild.org</a></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1167769/files/20150122135241-BumperstickerWolves.jpg?1421963561"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>Want to learn more? </b>Read these informative articles about the BC wolf cull</p><p>•     ‘<a href=""http://www.nature.com/news/wolf-cull-will-not-save-threatened-canadian-caribou-1.16734"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.nature.com/news/wolf-cull-will-not-save-threatened-canadian-caribou-1.16734"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wolf cull will not save threatened Canadian caribou</a>’ by <i>Nature</i> International Journal of Science </p><p>•     ‘<a href=""http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/canada-drags-%20%20heels-on-protecting-caribou/article22099249/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/canada-drags-%20%20heels-on-protecting-caribou/article22099249/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/canada-drags-heels-on-protecting-caribou/article22099249/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Canada has done little to protect endangered caribou population</a>’ by <i>The Globe &amp; Mail </i></p><p>• <a href=""http://www.cbc.ca/player/News/Canada/ID/2648302193/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> ‘</a><a href=""http://www.cbc.ca/player/News/Canada/ID/2648302193/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> ‘BC War on Wolves’ Interview with Ian McAllister</a>' by CBC News </p><p><b><b><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></b></b></p><p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">•     </b>Visit Pacific Wild’s <a href=""http://www.pacificwild.org/site/take_action/wolf-action.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.pacificwild.org/site/take_action/wolf-action.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">take action webpage</a> to find out what you can do to help. </p><p>•  <a href=""http://www.pacificwild.org/site/take_action/wolf-action.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.pacificwild.org/site/take_action/wolf-action.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Write a letter/send an email to the government</a> voicing your opposition to the wolf kill program in British Columbia </p><p>•  <a href=""https://www.change.org/p/save-b-c-wolves"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""https://www.change.org/p/save-b-c-wolves"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sign the petition</a> to Save B.C.

But wolves are taking the blame and paying the price. You can help.Pacific Wild Alliance, a leading wildlife conservation organization with a long track record of successful conservation achievements needs your support to put a stop to this barbaric wolf kill program.  We hope to raise $50,000 to provide a full-time campaigner with the resources to build local and international public pressure by exposing this wolf kill program as the unethical, inhumane and scientifically indefensible slaughter that it is through advertising, media and a host of other public outreach platforms. Funding will also go towards logistical support to document the current cull program directly - it is critical that the helicopter-based killing is recorded.B.C. Wolves need your help.The Issue•  Decades of habitat destruction and human encroachment have left B.C.’s woodland caribou in serious decline. But instead of protecting critical habitat, such as lichen-rich high elevation forests, the B.C. government turned a deaf ear to scientific warnings and allowed logging, industrial exploration and other kinds of human encroachment to take place. Now that the caribou are almost gone, they’ve decided to scapegoat wolves. These highly social and intelligent animals, icons of B.C.’s natural heritage, should not be killed because of long-term government negligence in regards to habitat protection.•   If the wolf kill program is allowed to continue, thousands of wolves will die a cruel and unnecessary death resulting in an ecosystem imbalance and loss of genetic diversity.   Don’t let that happen. Help us fight for the wolves' right to live.What We Need •   With donated advertising space, we are bringing this issue directly to the streets of Vancouver and Victoria where the wolf kill decision is ultimately made.   Help us make use of this valuable space.  Your donation will go to increasing advertising exposure in addition to production and design costs. •   Your support will help fund a full-time wolf campaign team with the means to build local and international public pressure by exposing this kill as unscientific and ineffective through a variety of media, including film, and a host of other public outreach platforms. •  Your support will ensure that wolves currently being killed now do not die in vain and that a long term solution that addresses the fundamental issue of habitat loss becomes the solution for the future of caribou in British Columbia. 
With the Save B.C. Wolves Indiegogo campaign
funds, we are supporting ground crews in the field actively who are actively
working to document the kill program.  We are designing ads for a new
public campaign that will bring this issue front and centre to British
Columbians. 
The Impact•   Your contribution can make a real difference to B.C's wolves. You can help shine a light on this wildlife tragedy and be part of the solution.  We have a team in place to tackle the front-lines of this issue, but they can only begin with your donations. •   There are solutions that do not result in intelligent, highly social animals being slaughtered in inhumane ways.  For example, winter-based motorized activity, one of the leading causes of caribou decline in the Selkirk mountains should be restricted from operating in endangered caribou habitat.  Traditionally, deep snow would provide security from wolves but the tracks made by vehicles allow wolves easy access to caribou. The B.C. government has known this for decades but has consistently capitulated to industry and recreational lobby groups who want access to this critical habitat.  Same story for logging, mining, and oil and gas companies - they continue to be granted access to lands that are critical for the survival of woodland caribou. •  If we are silent nothing will change.  The success of this fundraising campaign will allow us to  build enough pressure on government, through a concerted, strategic and informed public education campaign that the widespread killing of wolves will become a sad chapter in our history. Who Pacific Wild Alliance is Pacific Wild Alliance a B.C. non-profit organization committed to defending  wildlife and their habitat in Canada.  We work with a diverse array of communities, First Nations, groups and individuals to ensure that biodiversity protection is at the forefront of land and marine use decisions. •  Pacific Wild has a long track record of carrying out successful wildlife protection campaigns that involve science-informed, creative and result-based efforts.•  Find out more about our initiatives and team at www.pacificwild.orgWant to learn more? Read these informative articles about the BC wolf cull•     ‘Wolf cull will not save threatened Canadian caribou’ by Nature International Journal of Science •     ‘Canada has done little to protect endangered caribou population’ by The Globe & Mail •  ‘ ‘BC War on Wolves’ Interview with Ian McAllister' by CBC News Other Ways You Can Help•     Visit Pacific Wild’s take action webpage to find out what you can do to help. •  Write a letter/send an email to the government voicing your opposition to the wolf kill program in British Columbia •  Sign the petition to Save B.C.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>I have been given the opportunity to join my church on a mission trip to Manila, Cebu, &amp; Laoag along with a leadership development group I am a part of. The eight of us were tasked with adopting a cause, &amp; thus, Project 20 was born. Based on the statistic that worldwide, a child dies every 20 seconds from a water-related illness, we began our clean water initiative from (nearly) scratch. It is still in the beginning stages, but I have been working away at it for the last few months in preparation for the trip in February.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>During this initial trip, we will be bringing 9 water filters to slum villages in Cebu, where I, as the overseer of the project, will be teaching on proper hygiene, the use and upkeep of the filters, and about Jesus Christ. I am thrilled/nervous to be spearheading something that has the potential to change countless lives in the years to come!  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This trip, we will be bringing simple yet life-changing technology to 45 families living in the slums. We are starting relatively ""small"" so that we can ensure the accountability and sustainability of our program this year before expanding at an ambitious but unwise rate. Our goal will then be to expand within the Philippines and to other countries in the following years. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>These filters remove bacteria that causes cholera, e.coli, etc. in the water, which cause sicknesses and deaths worldwide. While we have the ability to safely drink water straight from the tap at any time, it makes no sense that millions of people in the world have to drink disease-ridden water, if they have water to drink at all.</p>

<p></p></div>","Context of Floresta de Iroko The Atlantic
Forest of Brazil comprises one of the most diverse ecosystems on earth. It is a
unique habitat that is home to thousands of endemic species of flora and fauna,
provides goods and services to an estimated 100 million Brazilians, and
contains 65% of the country’s population. Despite its invaluable role in the
socioeconomic and environmental systems of the country, only 11% of the
original forest remains due to commodity monoculture production,
urbanization and other encroaching forces.[1]
In early 2014, I joined with a group of 15 Brazilian friends to purchase 89 acres of land named Floresta de Iroko that encompasses a
portion of this endangered forest. The greater vision of this project is to
develop a community center that is based on principles of sustainability and
conservation, unity and equity, and education about ecological alternatives.
This pond will serve as one of our sources of water for drinking,
bathing, and irrigation.
The Atlantic
Forest is in grave danger of extinction and requires the initiative of
motivated individuals to incentivize conservation. One of the best ways to
create these incentives is through the development of productive ecological
landscapes. 


            An area of new
growth on previously disturbed soils. 
Greater Vision
Long-term objectives
on land: 

Implement
ecological agriculture techniques (permaculture, soil conservation, agroforestry,
seed saving);
Conserve
a percentage of the land and work to repopulate beneficial plant species, and control harmful species.

 Establish
communal spaces (space for children, artistic space for visual arts, dance and
music, alternative healing and nutrition center, kitchen for communal meals);

Develop
innovative waste treatment systems (dry toilets, compost, grey water)

 Use Bio-Construction techniques and materials sourced from the land to build structures
(bamboo construction, super adobe, rainwater catchment, alternative energy)

Create
educational spaces in which people can participate in and learn from activities
within the community.
Develop
community outreach programs to involve members of the surrounding region in the
sustainable community.
Construct business cooperatives that generate an income for the local community.
Collaborate
with US and local Brazilian educational institutions for research and
development opportunities.
An
example of the dense and lush rainforest flora that covers the majority of the land. There is an abundance of tropical fruit including bananas, acai,
cacao, jaca, graviola, mango and much more!

Immediate Goals
This project is an
evolving process that will require ongoing collaboration with community members
for the realization of our vision. Many of our long-term goals can only be achieved after preliminary measures have been taken to
ensure proper infrastructure and planning. With this in mind, this fundraiser
aims to provide the means to carry out the following immediate project
objectives for the Summer of 2014: 
- Sustainable
water systems ($3000)

Installation
of a cistern
Rainwater
catchment systems from roof-tops
Irrigation
systems from water sources to agricultural areas

- Waste
management systems ($1000)

Construct
dry composting toilets

- Preparation of
Agro-forest ($1000)

Purchase
tools and propagation materials for research about pioneer species and production
of Green Manure 
Use organic
matter ground cover and nitrogen-fixing pioneer plants to build soil nutrients

Preparation of the soil for the garden beds
where we will plant a variety of herbs and vegetables.

Who are we? 

We are a group
of fifteen people from 20-55 years of age from different regions of Brazil (I
am the only person from the US). Each member has unique educational and
occupational backgrounds including Oceanography, Biology, National Park
management and Agroecology. We have all worked diligently to earn the money to
purchase the land, and are now seeking outside funds to further advance the
objectives of the project. We routinely gather on the land for planning and
work sessions and each contribute unique skills and experiences to this effort.

Second meeting of some of the members of the
project to begin planning the foundations for the community center.

The two original landowners, Dona Rosa and Seu Ze, who will continue to
participate in the development of Floresta de Iroko.

preserve a piece of precious rainforest of great biodiversity
Contribute to local food production methods that capitalize on harmony with natural systems, integrated pest management, and soil conservation.
Support a movement to educate the local community about how to live sustainably in this
fragile environment.
Come spend time working and learning on the land.
Be a
part of a community effort where you will be able to impart knowledge and learn
from people in many different fields of study.
Donations of any amount are welcome, and will go directly to funding the immediate projects during the summer of 2014. You will receive periodic photos documenting the progress of this work.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are a group of concerned citizens who love Pelee Island and are coming together to raise money for this important cause. We are Kevin Ryersee- the president of the Pelee Island Co-Operative and its Board of Directors; Rick Masse - the Mayor of Pelee Island acting as a concerned property owner; Dave Dawson,  Pelee Island landowner; Margaret Atwood and Graeme Gibson, property owners and Suzanne Friemann, the Executive Director of The Pelee Island Bird Observatory. Our working group is assisting the Co-Op with the fundraising for the environmental study of the Scudder Harbour area. </li>
<li>All funds raised through this initiative will be deposited in the Township of Pelee Island's bank account and used exclusively for the environmental study.  </li>
<li>Unfortunately, due to the nature of this project, CRA has ruled that tax receipts are not available.</li>
<li>The Scudder Harbour Area, which is located at the north end of the island, is contaminated with hydrocarbons, fuel and oils, from the industrial use of the area for the past 100 years. It was used as a ferry dock, grain elevator, a freshwater fishery, a fuel dispensing facility and a marina.  All this industrial use has contributed to making the Scudder Harbour area a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownfield_land"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Brownfield</a>.  The Co-op has the only documented spill in the contaminated area of 680 Litres of diesel fuel.  Because of this fact, the Co-op is being held responsible by the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change, (MOECC) for the contamination and as a result, the Co-op is responsible for cleaning up their property and the surrounding properties.</li>
<li><p>In 2006, the directors of the Co-op had accepted the responsibility for the clean-up, and they made the required capital investment to bring the fuel dispensing facility to its current standards, as we see them today. The Co-op was successful in receiving a $600,000 provincially guaranteed loan and $140,000 from member loan debentures.  The Co-op had spent approximately $800,000 for the completed capital improvements and $250,000 for the clean-up of contaminated lands.  The MOECC approved the technology the contractor used, and this technique was proving effective in cleaning up the contamination, reaching a remediation level of 75%.</p></li>
<li><p>Unfortunately, there was a fire at the Co-op in 2009 which damaged the remediation equipment. The Co-op, through their insurance policy, received enough money to rebuild the building and replace some of their inventory.  The contractor came back three years later and installed the new treatment system.  They found that the hydrocarbon contamination had returned to their original levels.  After a couple of years of trying different technologies, the contractor determined that additional resources were required to identify from where the source of contamination was coming. </p></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
</div><div><ul>
<li>Because the Co-op used all of its resources and they were not making progress in the clean-up, MOECC ordered the Co-op to retain a new engineering firm to do a new study that would outline a plan of action to determine how the Co-op should proceed with cleaning up the site. The new study’s estimated cost is approximately $80,000.</li>
<li>MOECC had ordered the Co-op to complete the study by November 28, 2017, after being informed that the Co-op did not have the resources to complete this review.  The Co-op has asked the municipality for assistance in accessing a 50% grant from the Federation of Canadian Municipality’s, (FCM) Brownfield Fund.  The municipality had agreed to apply for this funding on behalf of the Co-op.  This grant application was put on hold because one of the requirements of the grant is securing the Co-op’s 50% of the funding at the time of application, which they were not able to do.</li>
<li>Therefore, the Co-op is asking for assistance to raise their 50%.  </li>
<li><strong>We have commitments from individuals for the first $10K which will be matched by other private donations. We hope to raise the remaining $20K from this Indiegogo campaign.</strong></li>
<li>
<i>The Co-op has obtained a municipal resolution asking the municipality to facilitate donations on behalf of the Co-op, restricting these funds to be used solely for Scudder Harbour Area Remediation study</i>.  <u>For every dollar received, they will be matched with the FCM Green Municipal Fund and be used to move forward with the MOECC ordered the survey of the Scudder area hopefully in the spring of 2018</u>.</li>
</ul></div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>We feel this is a community problem because, with the loss of the Co-op’s facility, our remote community risks losing our fuel dispensing facility, our grocery store, our post office and our hardware store. If the Co-Op is forced to close, this will damage Pelee Island's fragile economy.  Without a fuel dispensing facility, the Island’s drainage infrastructure will lose the fuel filling service and the ability to remove water from our marshes; this could cause the Island to flood and cause a state of emergency.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Margaret Atwood relays her experience with the Pelee Island Co-op: ""Graeme Gibson and I have had a place on Pelee since 1987, and have spent as much as a third of each year there.

Risks & Challenges

 

The risk is not being able to raise the matching funds and therefore not being able to complete the study. If we are unsuccessful in raising the full amount at this time,  the funds  will be held in trust until additional funds are raised and the study can be completed.
The challenge is in trying to raise funds during the winter when there are no tourists on the island. However, we know that there are thousands of Pelee Island fans who will want to help out.

<h3>Imagine This...</h3>
<p>Imagine a map that is ""live"" with time lapse and video views of the North American continent playing inside of the map. Imagine being able to tap on any region in the map and dive into that area to fill the screen with what is going on in Nature in the part of the continent. You could see what is happening right now across the ecoregions. Or you could view a years worth of synchronized time-lapse playing across the map, and watch as the seasons change and migrations and life play out across the continent. That's the kind of glimpse of the continent that the Symphony of Life will show you!</p>
<h3>The Bigger Picture</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483716310/fjvfmzmy5aeobxjo2rvz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>My name is Charles St. Charles and I'm a Nature and wildlife photographer.  In my life I've been blessed to see and photograph many amazing things and visit places that have left me breathless with their beauty. I know that the most important thing that I do is share Nature with people. I've been doing this through classes that I teach, volunteer work, work with 4-H, outings that I lead, and presentations and stories that I share.</p>
<p>Lately we've been working on projects to reach a wider group.  We want others to have a better understanding of the natural world around them, and through that understanding lead them to appreciate and protect Nature.  And we are trying to encourage them to visit these regions and experience Nature first hand.  We've started a free digital publication called Nature of the Wild. Each issue features a season in a different eco region in North America.</p>
<p>I've been visiting these eco regions, gathering content for issues, and at the same time I've been talking to people about hosting cameras to create a network of time lapse videos across the continent. These hosts are from state and national parks, nature centers, and sometimes people just like you. This network is the foundation of the Symphony of Life. We will have 6 or more cameras in each of the 15 major eco regions in North America, so eventually a total of at least 90 cameras across the continent. </p>
<h3>The First Time In History</h3>
<p>This is the fist time in history that a project like this has been possible. As the network for these time lapse videos starts growing viewers will be able to experience and understand nature in new ways. They will not only see what happens in nature, but when it happens, how it is related to what goes on in the rest of the continent, and where they can go to see it first hand for themselves. </p>
<h3>Seeing The World in a New Way</h3>
<p>Through the Symphony of Life project students and other people interested in Nature and travel will be able to see their world in a new way that has never been possible before. We'll be combining time lapse and normal video with maps to show the synchronization of the seasons and the lives of animals in the eco regions.</p>

<p>They'll see beauty and drama play out across the continent, for example, video and time lapse of Sandhill cranes arriving and leaving the Platte River in Nebraska,</p>

<p>and they'll see video and time lapse of waterfowl hatching out and paddling away to explore the world. And they'll see exactly where and when Nature's dramas are playing out across the continent.</p>
<p>Each region plays its own brilliant notes in the Symphony of Life. Every season is a movement played as a crescendo, reaching a vivid, intense peak and then fading in a diminuendo into the next movement, the following season.</p>

<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;"">Then we will see spring pushing winter out from the south to the north as a parade of wildflowers marches across the continent. It is a vast symphony that plays in a cycle with new variations each year.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;"">Funding this project does more that put time lapse cameras in the hands of people who will show the visual tune of Nature playing in their region. It helps us see the big picture and gives us all a chance to celebrate life by experiencing this symphony of sight forever playing across the continent. You make possible a new way of seeing our home!</p>

<h3>Where will the funding go?</h3>
<p>The cameras used for the time lapse videos are modified sports cameras. Between the cost of the cameras, the specialized housings, the electronics, controllers, external batteries and chargers, the cost to deploy a camera is about $600. This year cameras will go into 4 eco regions with 6 cameras in each region for a total of 24 cameras. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485560992/wpnvpadnrbxjav0othhh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Twenty four cameras at $600 apiece comes to $14400. There is about an 8% cost involved in running the IndieGogo campaign that is split between IndieGogo and the processor of the transactions, so the total amount that we are looking to fund is $15,500. All of the funds we receive will go towards paying for hardware for this project.</p>
<p>That tells you financially where the funds would go, but how about where the cameras will go?</p>
<p>There are four eco regions where these cameras will go this coming year - </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Perk - Credit in Video</h3>
<p><i>Your name in bright lights, you've made it! If you help fund a time lapse camera kit at the $300 level your name will show up in the credits in every single video that is made from that camera. Every time a new video is created you (and anyone else who watches) will get a pleasant reminder of how you made this project possible! </i></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Perk - Sponsor Credit in Video</h3>
<p><i>Wow, you're now a star! When you contribute at $600 or above you'll receive sponsor credit in any videos made from the cameras that you sponsor. In addition to being touted as a generous sponsor you'll get additional credit as a Cameraman, Production Assistant, Assistant Producer, or even a Region Producer based on the level that you contribute at. So fire up the home theatre, make a bowl of popcorn, invite friends over and start the video. You are a person who makes things happen, and you have the credit to prove it!</i></p>
<p><strong><i>These are great levels for corporations and organizations to sponsor, you'll receive ongoing attribution and recognition for your generosity well after the campaign is over.</i></strong></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Perk - Join Charles in an Eco Region</h3>
<p><i>If you are contributing at the Eco Region Producer level you can join Charles in the field in an Eco Region. You'll have a chance to see time lapse cameras deployed and get involved in the articles that he is working on. </i></p>
<h3>What if we don't reach our goal?</h3>
<p>What will happen if we don't reach the goal? The money will still go to purchasing cameras and hardware. We might not be able to place as many cameras and cover regions as quickly, but the project will still move forward. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There are two main impacts of this project, one has to do with visualization and learning, and the other has to do with conservation and preservation.</p>
<p>This project makes possible a new way of seeing the continent. You may or may not be in sync with the natural world around you, some people are deeply bound to Nature and some live lives where their spirits are drifting away from the natural world. But either way, it is extremely rare for a person to have connections to more than one eco region. This project makes it possible for people to experience a bigger world and more easily put their existence in context with life across the entire continent. </p>
<p>It is not easy to visualize a continent throughout the year. This project will widen your world and expand your vision of where you are in it. The Symphony of Life also sits in the Nature Of The Wild project, which has videos, articles, maps and animations for each of the eco regions that these cameras are going to. The articles cover everything from endangered species to volunteer opportunities in the eco region. So the Symphony of Life fits solidly in a good learning experience for anyone interested in Nature.</p>
<p>Time lapse is about to come of age as a tool for conservation and preservation. When you contribute to a project like this you are doing more than help yourself and others see the different parts of the continent, you are also helping to document changes in the environment. This is going to become increasingly important as pressure increases on Nature. We will be able to see exactly what effects these forces are having. Its our hope that enabling a wide audience to view specific locations will lead to the same people caring about and protecting those areas. We want to increase the places that we all feel bound to!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>First the good news, unlike projects where the perks are in limbo because the product hasn't been developed, your perks are in the can, safe and sound and guaranteed to be available. Kind of takes the mystery out of whether we'll deliver, right?</p>
<p>But there are a few challenges in the deployment of the cameras. We currently rely on hosts to change batteries and pull data cards. The people that do this are our unsung heros! We are actively working on ways to make their lives a little easier. First by better management of power and second by remote delivery of data. </p>
<p>There are all kinds of challenges that come up during the actual time lapses. </p>
<p>One landscape time lapse ended unexpectedly when turtles started using the camera housing as a sunning platform, and then they kicked it into the water. </p>
<p>Another time lapse that was running to capture images of maple leaves opening in the spring failed when a strong wind storm came through and actually disconnected the power supply cable. </p>
<p>On another time lapse the camera was capturing a mallard hen incubating eggs in a nest, and after a month the power ran out the day before the eggs hatched. </p>
<p>Unexpected things happen, but they are always learning experiences. They give us a better chance to setup the next time lapse in a better way so that we can anticipate problems. </p>
<p>On one setup we were capturing wild trilliums blooming in the forest, we knew that morel mushrooms would be coming up at the same time and that mushroom hunters would be exploring the woods at the same time as the time lapse. We were worried that someone might go home with a camera instead of mushrooms. So we found a stump that could easily be moved, we used a chain saw to cut a slot into it for the camera, and then screwed moss around the camera and buried the power supply under the stump. It worked great, six mushroom hunters showed up in the time lapse but the camera was never discovered, and now the portable stump is part of our arsenal!</p>
<p>We actually plan for somethings to go wrong. There are multiple cameras in each region to let us cover both landscape and natural events in the region, but also to help us overcome problems that happen in the field. </p>
<p>We are working on ways so that in the future we can monitor the cameras more closely. One of the advantages of time lapse is that even if something does go wrong, it can often be easily recovered from. If you lose a day or two in a time lapse you can still tell a compelling story, and sometimes the gaps are not even noticeable.</p>
<p>The challenges are there, but we are getting better at this as time goes on. And there are always other stories to tell on the other cameras...</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Time</h3>
<p>A very real limitation is time. Charles is sometimes on the road for 6 weeks to cover a season in one of the eco regions. That places a real limitation on how many eco regions he can cover in a year. We are covering four eco regions in a year. It is possible that more resources will come in for the project, but currently we can only do 4 eco regions a year.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are interested in our projects there are lots of other ways you can help! </p>
<p>The easiest is just to share the project with your friends. You can do that by either clicking on one of the social media buttons on this page or sending the URL to friends in email.</p>
<p>If you know of an organization that would like to host a camera please put them in contact with us by having them send email to jennifer@natureofthewild.com .</p>
<p>The work we are doing is free to everyone. We are creating more articles all the time and building interactive interfaces to content. If you know a teacher that might be interested in using any of our material in the classroom we would love to help out, please send email to jennifer@natureofthewild.com .</p>
<p>If you, or someone you know would like to make an older GoPro available for this project please contact us.</p>
</div></div>","Imagine This...
Imagine a map that is ""live"" with time lapse and video views of the North American continent playing inside of the map. Imagine being able to tap on any region in the map and dive into that area to fill the screen with what is going on in Nature in the part of the continent. You could see what is happening right now across the ecoregions. Or you could view a years worth of synchronized time-lapse playing across the map, and watch as the seasons change and migrations and life play out across the continent. That's the kind of glimpse of the continent that the Symphony of Life will show you!
The Bigger Picture

My name is Charles St. Charles and I'm a Nature and wildlife photographer.  In my life I've been blessed to see and photograph many amazing things and visit places that have left me breathless with their beauty. I know that the most important thing that I do is share Nature with people. I've been doing this through classes that I teach, volunteer work, work with 4-H, outings that I lead, and presentations and stories that I share.
Lately we've been working on projects to reach a wider group.  We want others to have a better understanding of the natural world around them, and through that understanding lead them to appreciate and protect Nature.  And we are trying to encourage them to visit these regions and experience Nature first hand.  We've started a free digital publication called Nature of the Wild. Each issue features a season in a different eco region in North America.
I've been visiting these eco regions, gathering content for issues, and at the same time I've been talking to people about hosting cameras to create a network of time lapse videos across the continent. These hosts are from state and national parks, nature centers, and sometimes people just like you. This network is the foundation of the Symphony of Life. We will have 6 or more cameras in each of the 15 major eco regions in North America, so eventually a total of at least 90 cameras across the continent. 
The First Time In History
This is the fist time in history that a project like this has been possible. As the network for these time lapse videos starts growing viewers will be able to experience and understand nature in new ways. They will not only see what happens in nature, but when it happens, how it is related to what goes on in the rest of the continent, and where they can go to see it first hand for themselves. 
Seeing The World in a New Way
Through the Symphony of Life project students and other people interested in Nature and travel will be able to see their world in a new way that has never been possible before. We'll be combining time lapse and normal video with maps to show the synchronization of the seasons and the lives of animals in the eco regions.

They'll see beauty and drama play out across the continent, for example, video and time lapse of Sandhill cranes arriving and leaving the Platte River in Nebraska,

they'll see video and time lapse of monarch butterflies coming and going from the wintering grounds in Mexico,

and they'll see video and time lapse of waterfowl hatching out and paddling away to explore the world. And they'll see exactly where and when Nature's dramas are playing out across the continent.
Each region plays its own brilliant notes in the Symphony of Life. Every season is a movement played as a crescendo, reaching a vivid, intense peak and then fading in a diminuendo into the next movement, the following season.

We will see fall recede as the snows of winter approach down mountain peaks,

and fan out from the north to the south.

 
Then we will see spring pushing winter out from the south to the north as a parade of wildflowers marches across the continent. It is a vast symphony that plays in a cycle with new variations each year.
Funding this project does more that put time lapse cameras in the hands of people who will show the visual tune of Nature playing in their region. It helps us see the big picture and gives us all a chance to celebrate life by experiencing this symphony of sight forever playing across the continent. You make possible a new way of seeing our home!
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Where will the funding go?
The cameras used for the time lapse videos are modified sports cameras. Between the cost of the cameras, the specialized housings, the electronics, controllers, external batteries and chargers, the cost to deploy a camera is about $600. This year cameras will go into 4 eco regions with 6 cameras in each region for a total of 24 cameras. 

Twenty four cameras at $600 apiece comes to $14400. There is about an 8% cost involved in running the IndieGogo campaign that is split between IndieGogo and the processor of the transactions, so the total amount that we are looking to fund is $15,500. All of the funds we receive will go towards paying for hardware for this project.
That tells you financially where the funds would go, but how about where the cameras will go?
There are four eco regions where these cameras will go this coming year - 

six cameras go to Northern Forests and the Great Lakes,

six cameras go to Northwestern Forested Mountains (the Rockies),

six cameras go to North American Deserts,

and six cameras go to the Great Plains.
Perks!
Your generosity will make it possible for us to purchase the hardware that we need for the camera network, but what is in it for you? Show me the Perks!
Perk - Nature Of The Wild Publication

A beautiful, informative digital publication that features a different North American eco region in each issue. Video, interactive graphics, animations, photos, maps, time lapse and text grace the articles in each issue.
You will learn about both common and endangered animals, and fascinating subjects like the largest organism on earth, fish that live in the desert, and birds that dance to attract mates. You'll watch baby animals at play and the stars whirling across the sky. You'll learn about an incredibly cute little mammal  that is threatened by global warming and you'll find out about volunteer opportunities where you can make a difference. 
And as a contributor to the Symphony of life you will get access to an online personalized version of the Nature of the Wild publication where you can watch time lapse videos that YOU helped make possible!
Perk - Trumpeter Swan Video
""I'm haunted by the beauty of this video. It's wonderful!"" - Judith Hainaut
This perk gives you access to a stunningly beautiful video about the return of Trumpeter Swans. This is one of the best conservation stories in North America. The video features life in the wintering grounds for the largest water fowl in the world. These birds were once widely thought to be extinct, then the efforts of conservationists, biologists, and every day people helped them recover and return to some of their traditional range. This is a story of hope and enlightened attitudes!
Perk - Eco Region Newsletter

The Eco Region Newsletter is where we keep you up to date on our most recent work. You'll get updates from the field, find out where we are currently shooting, what equipment we are using, and get early glimpses of time lapse, videos, images and articles before the the public gets to see them.

Perk - Credit in Video
Your name in bright lights, you've made it! If you help fund a time lapse camera kit at the $300 level your name will show up in the credits in every single video that is made from that camera. Every time a new video is created you (and anyone else who watches) will get a pleasant reminder of how you made this project possible! 
Perk - Sponsor Credit in Video
Wow, you're now a star! When you contribute at $600 or above you'll receive sponsor credit in any videos made from the cameras that you sponsor. In addition to being touted as a generous sponsor you'll get additional credit as a Cameraman, Production Assistant, Assistant Producer, or even a Region Producer based on the level that you contribute at. So fire up the home theatre, make a bowl of popcorn, invite friends over and start the video. You are a person who makes things happen, and you have the credit to prove it!
These are great levels for corporations and organizations to sponsor, you'll receive ongoing attribution and recognition for your generosity well after the campaign is over.
Perk - Join Charles in an Eco Region
If you are contributing at the Eco Region Producer level you can join Charles in the field in an Eco Region. You'll have a chance to see time lapse cameras deployed and get involved in the articles that he is working on. 
What if we don't reach our goal?
What will happen if we don't reach the goal? The money will still go to purchasing cameras and hardware. We might not be able to place as many cameras and cover regions as quickly, but the project will still move forward. 

The Impact
There are two main impacts of this project, one has to do with visualization and learning, and the other has to do with conservation and preservation.
This project makes possible a new way of seeing the continent. You may or may not be in sync with the natural world around you, some people are deeply bound to Nature and some live lives where their spirits are drifting away from the natural world. But either way, it is extremely rare for a person to have connections to more than one eco region. This project makes it possible for people to experience a bigger world and more easily put their existence in context with life across the entire continent. 
It is not easy to visualize a continent throughout the year. This project will widen your world and expand your vision of where you are in it. The Symphony of Life also sits in the Nature Of The Wild project, which has videos, articles, maps and animations for each of the eco regions that these cameras are going to. The articles cover everything from endangered species to volunteer opportunities in the eco region. So the Symphony of Life fits solidly in a good learning experience for anyone interested in Nature.
Time lapse is about to come of age as a tool for conservation and preservation. When you contribute to a project like this you are doing more than help yourself and others see the different parts of the continent, you are also helping to document changes in the environment. This is going to become increasingly important as pressure increases on Nature. We will be able to see exactly what effects these forces are having. Its our hope that enabling a wide audience to view specific locations will lead to the same people caring about and protecting those areas. We want to increase the places that we all feel bound to!

Risks & Challenges
First the good news, unlike projects where the perks are in limbo because the product hasn't been developed, your perks are in the can, safe and sound and guaranteed to be available. Kind of takes the mystery out of whether we'll deliver, right?
But there are a few challenges in the deployment of the cameras. We currently rely on hosts to change batteries and pull data cards. The people that do this are our unsung heros! We are actively working on ways to make their lives a little easier. First by better management of power and second by remote delivery of data. 
There are all kinds of challenges that come up during the actual time lapses. 
One landscape time lapse ended unexpectedly when turtles started using the camera housing as a sunning platform, and then they kicked it into the water. 
Another time lapse that was running to capture images of maple leaves opening in the spring failed when a strong wind storm came through and actually disconnected the power supply cable. 
On another time lapse the camera was capturing a mallard hen incubating eggs in a nest, and after a month the power ran out the day before the eggs hatched. 
Unexpected things happen, but they are always learning experiences. They give us a better chance to setup the next time lapse in a better way so that we can anticipate problems. 
On one setup we were capturing wild trilliums blooming in the forest, we knew that morel mushrooms would be coming up at the same time and that mushroom hunters would be exploring the woods at the same time as the time lapse. We were worried that someone might go home with a camera instead of mushrooms. So we found a stump that could easily be moved, we used a chain saw to cut a slot into it for the camera, and then screwed moss around the camera and buried the power supply under the stump. It worked great, six mushroom hunters showed up in the time lapse but the camera was never discovered, and now the portable stump is part of our arsenal!
We actually plan for somethings to go wrong. There are multiple cameras in each region to let us cover both landscape and natural events in the region, but also to help us overcome problems that happen in the field. 
We are working on ways so that in the future we can monitor the cameras more closely. One of the advantages of time lapse is that even if something does go wrong, it can often be easily recovered from. If you lose a day or two in a time lapse you can still tell a compelling story, and sometimes the gaps are not even noticeable.
The challenges are there, but we are getting better at this as time goes on. And there are always other stories to tell on the other cameras...
 
Time
A very real limitation is time. Charles is sometimes on the road for 6 weeks to cover a season in one of the eco regions. That places a real limitation on how many eco regions he can cover in a year. We are covering four eco regions in a year. It is possible that more resources will come in for the project, but currently we can only do 4 eco regions a year.

<br/><div>
<p>At first I didn’t know how to fulfil my promise. How can one person help
the world’s largest rainforest? </p>
<p>Truth is the vehicle of change is <b>global awareness</b><b>.</b> For the destruction to end, the world needs to know what’s happening in
the Amazon. </p>
<p>After months of savings, researching, planning, I'm ready to fulfil my promise.</p>
<p>With your help,</p>
<h3><b>I will cross the whole of the Amazon by Boat.</b></h3>
<h4>
<b>4000 miles, </b><b>4 months, 3 rainforest conservation projects.</b> </h4>
<p>I ask you to jump on board. Through rain and shine we will cross from
Peru to Ecuador, and from Colombia to the end of the river in Brazil. Mile by mile, I will share with you the rainforest’s
beauty but also its destruction from the inside.</p>
<p><b>The goal of my journey is to inspire people to make changes in their
own lives that help reduce deforestation, to push corporations to adopt zero
deforestation policies and to demand that governments create laws that reduce
devastation and promote genuine conservation.</b></p>
<p>I ask you to share this journey with others, to spread the message and
help Heal the Healer together.</p>
<p>You may wonder how I found myself in the Amazon in the first place, so let’s

<h3><b><b>THE STORY BEHIND</b></b></h3>
<div>
<b></b><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440693891/zj3ygl6z0lcjmwmx2vmh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p>

<p><i>On a boat in the Amazon</i></p>
<p>Until about a year ago, I walked a fairly conventional path – uni, a
series of jobs, my own design business in a big city. That’s when I asked
myself:</p>
<p><b>Is my life sustainable for myself and the planet?</b></p>
<p>The inconvenient truth was right in my face. No, there was nothing
sustainable in working long hours often serving a system I did not believe was serving any good,
so I can pay a huge rent for a tiny space, accumulating stress of
unfulfillment, only to release it through undeniably unhealthy habits so I
can... go back to work.</p>
<p>Without a second thought I gave away my stuff, quit my flat, and with a
backpack and a camera, I left the big city. Without really knowing where I'm
going, but feeling sure I'm going where I'm supposed to go, I embarked on a
mission:</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>To learn what it is to Live Sustainably.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440695969/k0cyozvvb4flecl2iyj1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>Hiking the Manu region</i></p>
<p>The road lead me to volunteer at eco villages, transformational
festivals, healing places and most importantly, outside in nature. Along this
journey I learnt more than I had learnt in the past 15 years living in big
cities. I learnt how life can be outside the systems we take for granted, how
to live with much less stuff, how to plant food, manage my waste, build
ecologically, work with nature and how to connect with people on a new, real
level. Along this journey I took notes, many notes, photographs and
videos. </p>
<p>I felt the need to share the news so I started writing this blog:</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/healing-the-healer-a-promise-to-the-amazon--2/edit/www.theplanison.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b></b></a><b><a href=""www.theplanison.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""https://theplanison.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">A JOURNEY TO SUSTAINABILITY</a></b></p>
<p>Within 6 months a couple of thousands of people from 55 countries around
the world visited it and many initiated conversations on health, the
environment, and sustainability.</p>
<p>It was along this journey that I found myself in the Peruvian Amazon.
The rainforest is buzzing. Life is
thriving in every scale. Insects, butterflies, birds, animals, people, coexist
symbiotically with the forest. </p>
<p><b>But the rainforest is not only a majestic ecosystem. It's a living
pharmacy.</b></p>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441052628/mxn8sqgf1wilqqjlqfgy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>Amazonian healing plant: Piñon blanco</i></p>
<p></p>
<p>The medicinal value of the Amazonian plants is just beginning to become
known in the rest of the world, but for the indigenous people it’s a sacred
knowledge they hold for millennia. Thousands of travellers are healed every
year in the Amazon and I am one of them.</p>

So, 1 year, 5
countries, 3 ecovillages, countless life lessons, immense healing and thousands
of mosquito bites later, I'm returning to the Amazon to fulfil my promise, because <b>there can't be sustainable life without the rainforest. </b><b><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></b><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span>

<h4><b>10 OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP HEAL THE HEALER</b></h4>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<p><b>Say NO to palm oil. </b></p>
<p>Palm oil, found in half of all processed foods, is a key contributor to
rainforest deforestation. Read your food and beauty product labels
carefully, and avoid this ingredient. </p>
<p><b>Brazilian Music, Si, Brazilian Beef, No!</b></p>
<p> 60-70% of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon results from
cattle ranching. Brazil is the world’s 2nd largest beef exporter.</p>
<p><b>Teach Your Children.</b></p>
<p>Teach kids about the importance of rainforests to the health of our
planet. Empower them to make responsible choices.</p>
<p><b>Furnish Wisely.</b></p>
<p>Avoid furniture and other products made from threatened rainforest woods
like: <b>Mahogany, Rosewood and Ebony. </b>Logging and the new roads
it necessitates is a major driver of long term rainforest destruction.</p>
<p><b>Reduce Your Consumption of Fossil Fuels.</b></p>
<p>Oil extraction in the Amazon has increased dramatically with devastating
social and environmental consequences. Approximately 70% of the entire Peruvian
Amazon in now leased by oil companies.</p>
<p><b>Travel Green.</b></p>
<p>Ride your bike, take mass transit or carpool to work. Every little bit
helps. If you travel to a rainforest area, make sure your tourist dollars
support local communities who protect the local environment.</p>
<p><b>Be A Rainforest Friend.</b></p>
<p>Learn about and support the demarcation of indigenous lands. It has been
proven that indigenous peoples are the best forest stewards. <a href=""http://www.wri.org/securingrights"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Read the World Resources Institute

THE PROMISE
I made this promise 8 months ago, as I was leaving the Peruvian Amazon
filled with gratitude for the rainforest and its people. 
I had just been healed.
Stunned by the Amazon’s immense beauty but also struck by its savage
devastation, I made a promise to return, to help Heal the Healer in return.
Fact is our greatest biological treasure on earth is being destroyed
at a heart breaking rate to
serve our modern world’s unsustainable demands.source: Amazon Gold Mining: Behold The Devastation

At first I didn’t know how to fulfil my promise. How can one person help
the world’s largest rainforest? 
Truth is the vehicle of change is global awareness. For the destruction to end, the world needs to know what’s happening in
the Amazon. 
After months of savings, researching, planning, I'm ready to fulfil my promise.
With your help,
I will cross the whole of the Amazon by Boat.

4000 miles, 4 months, 3 rainforest conservation projects. 
I ask you to jump on board. Through rain and shine we will cross from
Peru to Ecuador, and from Colombia to the end of the river in Brazil. Mile by mile, I will share with you the rainforest’s
beauty but also its destruction from the inside.
The goal of my journey is to inspire people to make changes in their
own lives that help reduce deforestation, to push corporations to adopt zero
deforestation policies and to demand that governments create laws that reduce
devastation and promote genuine conservation.
I ask you to share this journey with others, to spread the message and
help Heal the Healer together.
You may wonder how I found myself in the Amazon in the first place, so let’s
rewind back a bit…




THE STORY BEHIND








On a boat in the Amazon
Until about a year ago, I walked a fairly conventional path – uni, a
series of jobs, my own design business in a big city. That’s when I asked
myself:
Is my life sustainable for myself and the planet?
The inconvenient truth was right in my face. No, there was nothing
sustainable in working long hours often serving a system I did not believe was serving any good,
so I can pay a huge rent for a tiny space, accumulating stress of
unfulfillment, only to release it through undeniably unhealthy habits so I
can... go back to work.
Without a second thought I gave away my stuff, quit my flat, and with a
backpack and a camera, I left the big city. Without really knowing where I'm
going, but feeling sure I'm going where I'm supposed to go, I embarked on a
mission:

To learn what it is to Live Sustainably.


Hiking the Manu region
The road lead me to volunteer at eco villages, transformational
festivals, healing places and most importantly, outside in nature. Along this
journey I learnt more than I had learnt in the past 15 years living in big
cities. I learnt how life can be outside the systems we take for granted, how
to live with much less stuff, how to plant food, manage my waste, build
ecologically, work with nature and how to connect with people on a new, real
level. Along this journey I took notes, many notes, photographs and
videos. 
I felt the need to share the news so I started writing this blog:
A JOURNEY TO SUSTAINABILITY
Within 6 months a couple of thousands of people from 55 countries around
the world visited it and many initiated conversations on health, the
environment, and sustainability.
It was along this journey that I found myself in the Peruvian Amazon.
The rainforest is buzzing. Life is
thriving in every scale. Insects, butterflies, birds, animals, people, coexist
symbiotically with the forest. 
But the rainforest is not only a majestic ecosystem. It's a living
pharmacy.


Amazonian healing plant: Piñon blanco

The medicinal value of the Amazonian plants is just beginning to become
known in the rest of the world, but for the indigenous people it’s a sacred
knowledge they hold for millennia. Thousands of travellers are healed every
year in the Amazon and I am one of them.

So, 1 year, 5
countries, 3 ecovillages, countless life lessons, immense healing and thousands
of mosquito bites later, I'm returning to the Amazon to fulfil my promise, because there can't be sustainable life without the rainforest. 



MY JOURNEY - OUR MISSION









1st stop: PERU

We will start in the Peruvian Amazon, in Iquitos, where I will volunteer for a month at the Amazon Animal Orphanage & Pilpintuwasi Butterfly Farm, a non profit
organization protecting animals affected by the poaching and trafficking
industry.
Despite being an official rescue centre recognised by the government and
supporting the wildlife police in their efforts against wildlife crime,
Pilpintuwasi receives no funding and relies on the support of donations,
sponsorship and volunteers.
From Iquitos, we will jump on a boat to Ecuador.






2nd stop: ECUADOR

In Ecuador, I will get off at Quito where I will volunteer for a month at the Ceiba Foundation for Tropical Conservation, reforesting abandoned pastures with native tree species. Ceiba is dedicated to conservation of tropical ecosystems, and works with local people to protect natural resources and develop sustainable ways of living. 
From Ecuador, we will cross to Colombia.
3rd stop: COLOMBIA
Our long boat ride in the rainforest starts here. For about two weeks I will be travelling on the waters of the Amazon river. I will be sleeping in a hammock on the deck documenting the journey along the way. 

4th stop: BRAZIL

I will get
off the boat at Manaus to go to Oiyakaha, where I will volunteer for a month in ecological constructions and reforesting. Oiyakaha is situated 125km north of
Manaus and is contributing to the development of solutions for the humanitarian
and ecological needs of the Amazon. Its objective is to promote and develop
ecologically sound and healthy living.
Our ride will finish at the mouth of the Amazon river, in Belem, Atlantic Ocean. But our mission will be just beginning to save
this majestic place.








THE MAJESTIC PLACE

The Amazon Basin is immense.  
It contains 20% of the world's fresh water and covers almost 7
million square kilometres spanning across eight countries, Brazil, Bolivia,
Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana and Suriname.

In this basin lie the Amazon rainforest, a 5.5 million square kilometres of dense tropical forest, the
largest and most species rich in the world. The rainforest has been in existence for at least 55 million years.

For millennia, hundreds of indigenous tribes have been thriving in this majestic place, living symbiotically with the rainforest.

THE DESTRUCTION




“Every two seconds, across the world, an area of forest the size of a football field is clear-cut by illegal loggers.” 




Until about 100 years ago, rainforests covered 14% of the earth's land surface. Now they cover only 6% and experts estimate that the last remaining rainforests could be consumed in less than 40 years.





source: Brent Stirton


The Amazon rainforest is vanishing
at a rate of 20,000 square miles a year. It’s being cleared by chainsaws, bulldozers and fires for its timber value and then is
followed by mining, farming and ranching operations, even by world giants like
Mitsubishi Corporation, Gerogia Pacific, Texaco and Unocal.



source: Greenpeace


About 20% of the Amazon rainforest has been
destroyed in the last 30 years, leading to murderings
and massive displacements of native people, extinction of tens of thousands of
species and huge carbon emissions. 



Evacuation of the Kayapo tribe in the Brazilian Amazon
Google recently released a devastating timelapse of 40 Years of Environmental Destruction in the Amazon. Studies have shown than a staggering 80% of all logging in the rainforest is illegal. Because of the density and vastness of the Amazon, illegal loggers are incredibly difficult to track. But not impossible.  Last year, Greenpeace activists used GPS tracking technology to expose illegal logging in Brazil, and recently the Amazon Basin Conservation Association (ACA) partnered with Wake Forest University on a mission to use drones to monitor and track illegal logging.
However, the scenarios for 2050 predict that more than half of the rainforest will be forever gone. Hundreds of plant and animal species, and indigenous tribes, will be forever gone with it.

Even if
you live on the other side of the world, the destruction of the Amazon
rainforest affects your life:

The air you breath is changing

The Amazon Rainforest has been described as the “Lungs of our Planet” because it provides the essential environmental world service of continuously recycling carbon dioxide into oxygen.
More than 20% of the world’s oxygen is produced in the Amazon Rainforest.

Furthermore, deforestation is the 2nd highest and fastest growing contributor to
carbon emissions and global climate change.

As the rainforest species and indigenous cultures disappear, so do many possible cures for life-threatening diseases. While 25% of Western pharmaceuticals are derived from rainforest ingredients, less than 1% of these tropical trees and plants have been tested by scientists. Most medicine men and women and shamans remaining in the Amazon Rainforest are 70 years old or more. Each time one dies, a vast body of knowledge is lost. Most of the shamans today do not have apprentices. That is thousands of years of accumulated medicinal knowledge that come completely and irreversibly to an end.

10 OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP HEAL THE HEALER

Say NO to palm oil. 
Palm oil, found in half of all processed foods, is a key contributor to
rainforest deforestation. Read your food and beauty product labels
carefully, and avoid this ingredient. 
Brazilian Music, Si, Brazilian Beef, No!
 60-70% of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon results from
cattle ranching. Brazil is the world’s 2nd largest beef exporter.
Teach Your Children.
Teach kids about the importance of rainforests to the health of our
planet. Empower them to make responsible choices.
Furnish Wisely.
Avoid furniture and other products made from threatened rainforest woods
like: Mahogany, Rosewood and Ebony. Logging and the new roads
it necessitates is a major driver of long term rainforest destruction.
Reduce Your Consumption of Fossil Fuels.
Oil extraction in the Amazon has increased dramatically with devastating
social and environmental consequences. Approximately 70% of the entire Peruvian
Amazon in now leased by oil companies.
Travel Green.
Ride your bike, take mass transit or carpool to work. Every little bit
helps. If you travel to a rainforest area, make sure your tourist dollars
support local communities who protect the local environment.
Be A Rainforest Friend.
Learn about and support the demarcation of indigenous lands. It has been
proven that indigenous peoples are the best forest stewards. Read the World Resources Institute
Report: Securing Rights, Combating Climate Change.

<p><strong>Me &amp; My Goal:</strong></p>
<p>A quick bit about me: Born and raised here on O’ahu, I am 23 years old and studying Natural Resources and Environmental Management (NREM) at the University of Hawaii. I have lots of experience (and tons of fun) working with young children and I believe in getting people interested in their earth’s systems and resources at an early age.</p>
<p>To me, young girls being exposed to information about environmental issues through beauty pageants is an extraordinary concept! While most pageants involve a talent portion, the Miss Earth judges instead interview contestants as to their basic knowledge of environmental concerns today, as well as their specific platforms or causes. </p>
<p><strong>What I Need:</strong></p>
<p>Here’s my dilemma folks! I have unlimited resources at my disposal for research, study, and speaking material due to our great sources at UH. However, being a broke college student – I have no means of acquiring $600 that will cover the basic costs of the pageant: </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>$350 – Entrance Fee</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>$250 - Required Interview Attire/Evening Gown</strong></p>
<p>I regret that I do not have the financial means to provide many fun perks for my sponsors –funds raised will determine whether or not I will compete at all.</p>
<p>If I am unsuccessful in raising the full amount, the funding I have received will first go towards covering the $350 entrance fee. Should I raise an amount over my $600 goal, the remainder will be donated to the Hawaii Conservation Alliance. </p>
<p><strong>MY PLATFORM:</strong></p>
<p><strong>“The greatest danger to our future is <em>apathy</em>.” – Jane Goodall. </strong></p>
<p>I firmly believe that the greatest environmental concern that we face as a global population today is the disconnect between our natural world and our corporate world. As the bridge between these two worlds, humans ought to be thoroughly informed about issues regarding their environment and natural resources. Yet many are not. Blame for this should lay on the shoulders of mainstream media and local and federal governments or entities – not the people themselves.</p>
<p>Last spring, I along with a group of peers was required to execute a project that: Created and added a Research Guide for Environmental Resources on SBCC’s Library website: <a href=""http://library.sbcc.edu/findsearch/research-guides/sustainability-resources/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://library.sbcc.edu/findsearch/research-guides/sustainability-resources/</a></p>
<p>Our project included obtaining agreements with English 110 teachers resulting in a minimum of <strong>1,000 college students researching and reporting on environmental issues of their choice. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Creating an educated, informed general public is a SURE-FIRE for us as a global population to see way to see some progress in the preservation of our natural world and the resources that depend on it.  Which is why I want to be the next Miss Earth – to be an Ambassador of the Environment and create the interest it deserves.</strong></p>

<p>While many groups work to save special places (and we'll do that too!), we are also working to SAVE CONSERVATIONISTS!</p>
<p><strong>The Hawaiian word “<em>Pono</em>” means to do what is right</strong> and we are “doing right by conservation.""</p>
<p>The Pono Project uses a new approach to bridge the gap between donors and the conservation organizations they fund. And that means ALL donors - big or small!</p>
<p>Our goal is to get <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>more money to deserving conservationists </strong></span>while making the grantmaking process simpler and easier, with reports that will be <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">WATCHED</span> instead of a 10 page paper report that gets filed away. Click on the ""Gallery"" tab at the top to view a sample video report from the East and West Maui Watershed Partnerships!</p>
<p>The Pono Project is a portal for “one stop donating” where groups can submit simplified proposals for environmental projects which are reviewed by a panel of experts who choose a subset of noteworthy and innovative projects that we are interested in funding.</p>
<p>Then, and <strong>this is the EXCITING PART</strong>, we crowd source public opinion to let <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">YOU</span> </strong>decide which of the top projects will be funded. Currently, only large donors get to choose which projects they think are important. With the new Pono Project method, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>every donor gets a vote! </strong> </span></p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Every donor can save a conservationist - whether its saving them time, money or their sanity!<br/></strong></span></p>
<p>We are changing the paradigm to not only let donors choose where their money goes, but also to get Projects that are up for funding to interact with the public via social media, and in the process, the Pono Project learns from its voters about why people donate and what projects they think are important, thereby <strong>cultivating interactive and longer term donors for the future.</strong></p>
<h3><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>So... the Pono Project is:</strong></span></h3>
<p>1. SAVING CONSERVATIONISTS!<br/>2. One Stop Donating to evaluated organizations<br/>3. Crowd Sourcing - Vote on the next Environmental Idol!<br/>4. A funder of important conservation efforts<br/>5. An art house of film, photography and social media for conservation efforts</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em><span class=""font_1"">""With tourism and our population growth, conservation will continue to be a priority. It is important to mediate that growth with comparable protections for our natural environment... The partnerships envisioned by the Pono Project can be an important investment in the sustainable future of our islands.""</span><span class=""font_6"">       <br/></span><strong>~ U.S. Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard</strong></em></p>

<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
<p>Your generous contribution will help to continue our efforts to build this new way of funding by developing the web and social media tools that will be needed to maintain the voting and video presence for all of our potential projects. We will be <strong>implementing website upgrades</strong> and <strong>creating new social media channels</strong> and <strong>our first blog</strong>.  We will be <strong>building new online tools</strong> for our ""Environmental Idol"" voting sessions, and <strong>ways to track and interact</strong> with individual donors in new ways. A new option on our upgraded website will include opportunities to get your hands dirty with some of the organizations that we fund, highlighting <strong>volunteer opportunities</strong> in your area.</p>
<p>Your support will also go towards significant logistical and operational needs such as <strong>outreach and marketing</strong> of this new idea to potential funders, donors and partners, in order to <strong>build the foundation of funds</strong> that will be distributed to noteworthy conservation projects. It will also contribute to the development of grantmaking protocols and media necessary to maintain our new form of reporting. With the new online and marketing tools, we will strengthen the groundswell of support that we will need to also bring in large donors and partner companies that will sustain this Project in the long run.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>What makes us different?</h2>
<p><strong>***What sets us apart from other similar organizations is not only our committment to putting the people first, but also our desire to work within social media, film and outreach to better connect the groups that we sponsor to the world and to make the granting process simple, fun and rewarding, instead of a burden.***</strong></p>
<p>Donations to the Pono Project are distributed to the hard-working conservation organizations that are chosen by our voting polls, and a portion also goes towards building outreach and social media materials (videos, photo shoots and social media campaigns) that will showcase each of the organizations we fund, as a new means of ""video reporting,"" alleviating some of the tedious paperwork that is involved in the grant process.</p>

While many groups work to save special places (and we'll do that too!), we are also working to SAVE CONSERVATIONISTS!
The Hawaiian word “Pono” means to do what is right and we are “doing right by conservation.""
The Pono Project uses a new approach to bridge the gap between donors and the conservation organizations they fund. And that means ALL donors - big or small!
Our goal is to get more money to deserving conservationists while making the grantmaking process simpler and easier, with reports that will be WATCHED instead of a 10 page paper report that gets filed away. Click on the ""Gallery"" tab at the top to view a sample video report from the East and West Maui Watershed Partnerships!
The Pono Project is a portal for “one stop donating” where groups can submit simplified proposals for environmental projects which are reviewed by a panel of experts who choose a subset of noteworthy and innovative projects that we are interested in funding.
Then, and this is the EXCITING PART, we crowd source public opinion to let YOU decide which of the top projects will be funded. Currently, only large donors get to choose which projects they think are important. With the new Pono Project method, every donor gets a vote!  
Every donor can save a conservationist - whether its saving them time, money or their sanity!
We are changing the paradigm to not only let donors choose where their money goes, but also to get Projects that are up for funding to interact with the public via social media, and in the process, the Pono Project learns from its voters about why people donate and what projects they think are important, thereby cultivating interactive and longer term donors for the future.
So... the Pono Project is:
1. SAVING CONSERVATIONISTS!2. One Stop Donating to evaluated organizations3. Crowd Sourcing - Vote on the next Environmental Idol!4. A funder of important conservation efforts5. An art house of film, photography and social media for conservation efforts
""With tourism and our population growth, conservation will continue to be a priority. It is important to mediate that growth with comparable protections for our natural environment... The partnerships envisioned by the Pono Project can be an important investment in the sustainable future of our islands.""       ~ U.S. Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard
 
What We Need & What You Get
Your generous contribution will help to continue our efforts to build this new way of funding by developing the web and social media tools that will be needed to maintain the voting and video presence for all of our potential projects. We will be implementing website upgrades and creating new social media channels and our first blog.  We will be building new online tools for our ""Environmental Idol"" voting sessions, and ways to track and interact with individual donors in new ways. A new option on our upgraded website will include opportunities to get your hands dirty with some of the organizations that we fund, highlighting volunteer opportunities in your area.
Your support will also go towards significant logistical and operational needs such as outreach and marketing of this new idea to potential funders, donors and partners, in order to build the foundation of funds that will be distributed to noteworthy conservation projects. It will also contribute to the development of grantmaking protocols and media necessary to maintain our new form of reporting. With the new online and marketing tools, we will strengthen the groundswell of support that we will need to also bring in large donors and partner companies that will sustain this Project in the long run.
 
What makes us different?
***What sets us apart from other similar organizations is not only our committment to putting the people first, but also our desire to work within social media, film and outreach to better connect the groups that we sponsor to the world and to make the granting process simple, fun and rewarding, instead of a burden.***
Donations to the Pono Project are distributed to the hard-working conservation organizations that are chosen by our voting polls, and a portion also goes towards building outreach and social media materials (videos, photo shoots and social media campaigns) that will showcase each of the organizations we fund, as a new means of ""video reporting,"" alleviating some of the tedious paperwork that is involved in the grant process.
""We are excited at the prospect of what the Pono Project will be bringing to Hawaii.""
Clifford Morden - Deputy Director, PCSU - University of Hawaii

Why should I donate to this campaign?
To SAVE A CONSERVATIONIST! And because being ""Pono"" is important!

If we were really doing ""what is right"" for conservation, we would be helping organizations to spend more time doing what they do best - protecting the places we love.
In every way, we will strive to create long-term, sustainable jobs for local communities, give them the tools they need to educate the public about their mission, and support them financially and logistically throughout the whole process.
""The Pono Project's reliable and consistent stream of funding will create or maintain local jobs, provide educational opportunities for our communities and visitors, and preserve the functions of our natural environment that keep our water, land and air clean and inviting.""
~ Maui County Council Chair - Gladys Baisa
 
The Pono Project is setup to be a world-wide effort and can be helpful anywhere. Our first Pono Project site is where the spirit of Pono was born - Hawai‘i.

<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">The Mµ Thermal Imager is the first affordable thermal imager with the resolution and software capabilities to make it useful to DIY homeowners as well as construction professionals. Technology originally developed for industrial use can now be readily available to you as an accessory for your smartphone, tablet, laptop and computer.  With the ease of use of a smart phone app but with enough visual clarity (19,200 pixels), accompanying information, and functionality to enable the user to make wise choices concerning their homes.</span></p>
<p>Up to now, cameras of this quality have cost anywhere from $2,000 to $22,000, and up to $150 a day to rent.  Our intent is to get the retail price of the Mµ Thermal Imager below $325 initially. </p>
<p>We've heard from realtors, house inspectors, farmers, contractors, firemen, building maintenance staff, medical practitioners, plumbers, pilots, electricians, insurance companies, parts manufactuerers, OEMs, oil field hands, and many more professions that all believe that this product could assist them in their day-to-day lives.  </p>
<p>Our funding goal is high, a mistake on my part as it may leave people with the concern that we won't be able to deliver the Thermal Imager if we don't hit that goal.  I was more concerned that people would not continue to consider purchasing a perk if we went over the funding request.  </p>
<p>We have various venture capital options open to us to fund the project through to completion.  The financing people are hard on our behinds to get this product in the market.  The idea for the IndieGoGo campaign came to us from one of our financial advisors; suggested as a means to retain a greater share of equity in our company during the earlier days of design and prototyping.   So...regardless of meeting our goal here or not, the Mµ Optics Thermal Imager is coming to market and all the early adopters and IndieGoGo supporters will definitely see their purchases delivered.  These IndieGoGo purchases are not devices we expect to make a profit on, our profits will come when we see the the Mµ Optics Thermal Imager in the Big Box stores we intend on selling through.  <span>We are working through the final evaluation of three image arrays and associated lenses to ensure quality levels, reliability, and cost.  We are under NDA's with a number of our parts suppliers and need to respect those agreements.  Our optics path is also something we believe is unique and is part of what makes our device affordable.</span></p>
<p>What we hear from so many suppliers and potential clients is that this is just the beginnings of the potential for these devices.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>LOWER YOUR HEATING AND COOLING BILLS!</strong></h2>
<h3>THE PERFECT GIFT FOR PEOPLE WITH EVERY TOOL IMAGINABLE IN THEIR TOOLBOXES. </h3>
<p>Our camera sees in the infrared spectrum of 7 to 14 micrometers which allows you to ""see"" the temperature of most anything in the range of -86 to 192 degrees Fahrenheit (-66 to 90 Celcius).</p>
<p>You'll be able to identify heating and cooling losses in your home and business, find lost pets in the dark, know just how cold your children's toes are when they ask you to turn up the heat, etc.  At home you can educate your family on ways in which they can stop energy losses due to their bad habits (such as leaving on a bathroom vent for longer than necessary). It’s a great tool for the DIY homeowner as they look for overworked electrical circuits and check the water heater and ductwork for energy leaks.  </p>
<p>In construction or renovation of buildings you'll be able to identify poorly insulated areas and badly wired electrical outlets before you put the drywall up. You'll find places where water has penetrated the structure where it should not have. Identifying mold and moisture is a much easier task with the Mµ Thermal Imager.</p>
<p>We can't wait to see what people will do with it.  How people use the Mµ Thermal Imager is something were not certain of yet, but we know that very quickly we'll find out just how useful it is.  How easy it is to find an pet in the dark, or to elevate hide and seek to another level!</p>

<p>Our goals with the camera and the software are simple at this point; make it capable, easy to use, and affordable.  Download the App from the app store of your device.  After attaching the Mµ thermal Imager to your smartphone or tablet via an adhesive polymer (that peels off without leaving a residue), you connect via USB to the base of the Smartphone (or tablet, etc.) the user will start the application just as they do with any app, with a finger touch to the app icon. At that point the screen will fill with the live video thermal image from the camera.  The image resolution is 160x120 (the images here are not yet fully optimized and will be much improved on the final product), and is more than sufficient to determine hot and cold spots via the color scale.  It is possible, but we don't want to promise this, that the camera will have a simple manual zoom (better image quality than a digital zoom).  Version Two will definitely include higher resolutions and include the ability to turn the image recorder on based on motion sensors.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Why we made the Mµ Thermal Imager.</strong></h3>
<p>The median age of an American home is 36 years old.  To call an North American home a bit of sieve when it comes to energy efficiency is not a stretch; and the same is true most everywhere in the world. homeowners lose billions of dollars every year through heating and cooling losses due to poor insulation, old windows, and even just leaving your kitchen exhaust fan on longer than you need to.  You'll be able to see all these losses (and teach your children about them).   Go to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography</a> to learn even more about what you can do with a thermal imaging camera.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Open Source</h3>
<p><span>We recognize the desire by many people to be able to modify their electronics. While we can't get into specifics right now, we are making every effort to make the imager as open source as possible.</span> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What Lies Ahead</strong></h3>
<p>We've been in development now for a few months or so on the hardware and software.  It's a relatively simple device with few parts but some amazing optics.   The next task, and we're well along the way to finishing it, is to make the device smartphone, tablet, computer, and laptop ready in both functionality and size.  </p>
<p>The funds we're seeking will pay for the final development and packaging of Mµ Thermal Imager, the hiring of a worldwide sales consultancy to sell Mµ Thermal Imager’s through to the hardware stores, heating and cooling companies, and insulation companies.  We're also in the midst of finalizing our website which will train people in all the different ways in which thermal images can make for a healthier and lower cost home, videos from existing users and, of course, we need to place the first significant order for the parts, manufacturing, and distribution.  We have found significant interest in the Mµ Thermal Imager from the big box hardware stores and from insulation manufacturers that we may bundle the Mµ Thermal Imager with.  </p>
<p>We hope you'll help us get past this critical juncture in our product development and we promise to work as hard as we can to make it happen as quickly as possible. Our funding request will get Mµ Thermal Imager into the stores; however, the more funds we raise the lower we can drive our costs, and ultimately the price of the imager.   We’d love to raise enough to make an order for the electronics and optics necessary that will allow us to sell the imager for less than $325.  So....please, even if you see us reach our goal, consider making a contribution anyway, you’ll get the Mµ Thermal Imager at a great discount and help drive down the cost for all the contributors. </p>

<p align=""left""> </p></div>","The Mu Optics Thermal Imager
The Mµ Thermal Imager is the first affordable thermal imager with the resolution and software capabilities to make it useful to DIY homeowners as well as construction professionals. Technology originally developed for industrial use can now be readily available to you as an accessory for your smartphone, tablet, laptop and computer.  With the ease of use of a smart phone app but with enough visual clarity (19,200 pixels), accompanying information, and functionality to enable the user to make wise choices concerning their homes.
Up to now, cameras of this quality have cost anywhere from $2,000 to $22,000, and up to $150 a day to rent.  Our intent is to get the retail price of the Mµ Thermal Imager below $325 initially. 
We've heard from realtors, house inspectors, farmers, contractors, firemen, building maintenance staff, medical practitioners, plumbers, pilots, electricians, insurance companies, parts manufactuerers, OEMs, oil field hands, and many more professions that all believe that this product could assist them in their day-to-day lives.  
Our funding goal is high, a mistake on my part as it may leave people with the concern that we won't be able to deliver the Thermal Imager if we don't hit that goal.  I was more concerned that people would not continue to consider purchasing a perk if we went over the funding request.  
We have various venture capital options open to us to fund the project through to completion.  The financing people are hard on our behinds to get this product in the market.  The idea for the IndieGoGo campaign came to us from one of our financial advisors; suggested as a means to retain a greater share of equity in our company during the earlier days of design and prototyping.   So...regardless of meeting our goal here or not, the Mµ Optics Thermal Imager is coming to market and all the early adopters and IndieGoGo supporters will definitely see their purchases delivered.  These IndieGoGo purchases are not devices we expect to make a profit on, our profits will come when we see the the Mµ Optics Thermal Imager in the Big Box stores we intend on selling through.  We are working through the final evaluation of three image arrays and associated lenses to ensure quality levels, reliability, and cost.  We are under NDA's with a number of our parts suppliers and need to respect those agreements.  Our optics path is also something we believe is unique and is part of what makes our device affordable.
What we hear from so many suppliers and potential clients is that this is just the beginnings of the potential for these devices.  
 
LOWER YOUR HEATING AND COOLING BILLS!
THE PERFECT GIFT FOR PEOPLE WITH EVERY TOOL IMAGINABLE IN THEIR TOOLBOXES. 
Our camera sees in the infrared spectrum of 7 to 14 micrometers which allows you to ""see"" the temperature of most anything in the range of -86 to 192 degrees Fahrenheit (-66 to 90 Celcius).
You'll be able to identify heating and cooling losses in your home and business, find lost pets in the dark, know just how cold your children's toes are when they ask you to turn up the heat, etc.  At home you can educate your family on ways in which they can stop energy losses due to their bad habits (such as leaving on a bathroom vent for longer than necessary). It’s a great tool for the DIY homeowner as they look for overworked electrical circuits and check the water heater and ductwork for energy leaks.  
In construction or renovation of buildings you'll be able to identify poorly insulated areas and badly wired electrical outlets before you put the drywall up. You'll find places where water has penetrated the structure where it should not have. Identifying mold and moisture is a much easier task with the Mµ Thermal Imager.
We can't wait to see what people will do with it.  How people use the Mµ Thermal Imager is something were not certain of yet, but we know that very quickly we'll find out just how useful it is.  How easy it is to find an pet in the dark, or to elevate hide and seek to another level!
 
                               iOS AND ANDROID COMPATIBLE.

 
Our software allows for:

Ease of operation - all functionality is through the touchscreen on a smartphone or tablet or a mouse on a computer.
Still image capture - high resolution of 160x120
H.264 Video recording -  no time limits beyond your device's memory limitations 
Selection of specific points for temperature information - Zoom window for pin point accuracy.


Blending of regular images with the thermal images for better views of what you're seeing - sometimes it's easier to tell what you're looking at when the IR image is blended with the regular video


Split screens between between both images - again, letting you know exactly what your seeing.

 

 Gradient Overlays
 

 

Selection of Farenhiet or Celcius.
Crosshair - for pin-point accuracy 


Charges via USB - use the same charger you use for your mobile device.
Long battery life between charges - all processing is done on the computing device so we expect more than an hour of record time between charges.
Lightweight-no heavy lens to balance
Focus free from 1.5 feet to infinity

 
Our goals with the camera and the software are simple at this point; make it capable, easy to use, and affordable.  Download the App from the app store of your device.  After attaching the Mµ thermal Imager to your smartphone or tablet via an adhesive polymer (that peels off without leaving a residue), you connect via USB to the base of the Smartphone (or tablet, etc.) the user will start the application just as they do with any app, with a finger touch to the app icon.

<p> <strong>SPONSOR A SUPERFOOD TREE IN NEED!</strong></p>
<p> <strong>Our Story</strong></p>
<p>Hi. This is Brandon and Emily Majewski and a whole lotta tropical saplings. We are two horticulturists who moved to Mexico and we’ve got a problem: once we started growing tropical superfoods from seed we just couldn’t stop. As of writing, we have 307 plants representing over 50 genera (and by the time you read this there will be even more plant mouths to feed). We believe these plants, despite growing up on the streets in crates, tins, shabby buckets and coffee cups, are destined for greatness.</p>
<p>It’s beginning to feel like our family is a cross between the Duggars, Octomom and a Botanical Garden! So far we have been able to provide a very temporary space of love for these superfood trees in our apartment. <strong>But to reach their full potential our family needs land!</strong> Our tiny apartment is overrun with trees and plants that deserve better homes than milk jugs and tin cans!</p>
<p><strong>Who We Are</strong></p>
<p>Brandon and I have over 30 years of combined horticultural experience, ranging from areas of agriculture, greenhouse production, permaculture design, estate gardening and landscape construction, in various countries. We are confident that our passion and hard work, together with our family of tropical superfoods, will do you proud.</p>
<p>Being professional green thumbs, self-proclaimed foodies and persons who have experienced deep family losses due to cancer, we recognize the curative and nutritional contributions to society these plants can make. Plants like pittaya, saba nut, acai, noni, macadamia nut, champagne mango, moringa, breadfruit, pili nut, guanabana, cashew, avocado,  medjool dates, pomegranates, etc. These and many more little ones need a new home to spread their roots. Do we get a bigger apartment? Do we send out plants for foster care? Or do we secure green space so they can grow old together, in a stable environment, with all the love and care they need to thrive? We asked the plants and it was unanimous: land!</p>
<p>We believe that the world needs more tree crops. Not only do many species contain exceptional levels of starches, proteins, vitamins and medicinal qualities, they perform many other jobs: moderating climate, regulating water cycles, preserving soil, feeding a diversity of non-human life. <strong>On a planet with limited space, we believe humans need to start growing food with super-nutrition, on less territory and with more benefits than those of wheat and corn.</strong> Tree crops and superfoods do all of the above and more! <strong>Together we can create a space where knowledge about and seeds from these species are free for the taking. </strong></p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Help us create a sanctuary for edible, useful, and native plants, here in Mexico.</span> The first step is land acquisition, and this is $35,000 dollars ($454,700 pesos) more than what we have. The more funds we raise, the more land we can purchase to dedicate to these incredible plants-in-need.</p>
<p><strong>Donating</strong></p>
<p>For as little as $10 you can help one of our 307 Superfood Tropical Trees find a Home. By Adopting-a-Superfood-Tree you can sleep at night knowing you’ve rescued a little guy from the streets of the concrete jungle. By sponsoring a tree in need, you help us provide a committed, long-term approach to growing these superfoods. Your help will effect plants and people for generations. We hope you, like us, believe that every Superfood tree deserves the chance to grow…because each tree can make the world a better place in so many ways.</p>
<p><strong>There will be various stages to creating a Superfood Sanctuary here in Mexico but by far the most important one is purchasing land. </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>PHASE 1: Land</strong></p>
<p>We need to raise at least $35, 000 to secure land and get our little ones in the soil where they belong. The site location will be announced in the spring of 2013 when the acquisition is final.  15% of the funds will be used to purchase the necessities required for “The Big Plant Out”, i.e.-  basic tools, mulching materials, labeling, simple irrigation systems and small-scale nursery infrastructure. 2% of the ultimate funds will go towards the purchase and maintenance of 3 goats (amigos to assist in brush control with manure as an added fertilizer bonus).</p>
<p>(If we don’t quite reach our fundraising goal, every penny and peso will be put towards a down payment on land. While this would necessitate mortgaging the Sanctuary, we are confident that eco-tourism revenue from the site would allow us to eventually pay off our debt load. However, it would be so much better to meet the goal and have the space available to visitors free of charge, with free dispersal of seed and knowledge about these amazing trees. Help us make this possible!)</p>
<p>Bear in mind that with the dollar’s relative strength to the Mexican Peso, your donation goes even further...Also note that perks are to be issued upon completion of the campaign :)</p>
<p>Your donation will create a positive and life giving ripple effect for years to come.   With a focus on seed collecting, we want recipients of our seed stock to then promise to offer their future seeds to anyone with the desire to grow, as a gift. It TRULY is the gift that keeps on giving, and not just to humans, but to the ecosystem. This is where food chain meets a Chain of Giving.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Of course, we understand if you can’t financially contribute at this time. The economy IS a bummer. But you can help us in a big way by sharing our campaign and blog on Twitter, Facebook and all those other social media tools we don’t know much about because we are too busy watering…Tell your friends, family, co-workers, neighbors...We’d really, really appreciate it. Thank you for helping, however you can…</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Sure We Can is a redemption center and sustainability hub in Bushwick, Brooklyn, which has been serving the community for 11 years. In addition to providing container-deposit redemption service, we view it as our responsibility to apply our effort and creativity to the worsening problems of consumption and waste in general, the consequences of which are exacerbating climate change and making the world a less clean, safe, and healthy place for our families.</p>
<p>This year, we've applied ourselves to the issue of single-use plastic film, which frustrates recyclers in New York City and across the world. It's ubiquitous, being used in restaurants, retailers, pharmacies, and in innumerable other places. NYC's 2020 plastic bag ban is a step in the right direction but is not close to sufficient: exceptions for wholesalers, restaurant delivery, and others mean plastic film will remain a part of our city's landscape, continuing to blight our streets and clog our recycling centers.</p>
<p>Sure We Can aims to address this creatively by first collecting single-use plastic film from consumers who don't wish to send it to the landfill, and also from local businesses, then ""upcycling"" it into sheets of durable, one-of-a-kind material. This new plastic can be used for all sorts of purposes: fabricated into reusable bags, sewn into clothing or accessories, or incorporated into new artistic or creative projects. Check out our first partnership, with Brooklyn designer Zero Waste Daniel: <a href=""https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/caitochs/this-fashion-line-is-made-from-actual-trash-and-it-looks"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/caitochs/t...</a></p>
<p>With our current setup, we can only operate on a very small scale. In order to make a meaningful impact on the plastic film problem we need to make upgrades to our workshop facility. These changes will permit us to scale up our collection and production capacity, while also increasing our efficiency. By donating to this project, you will be contributing directly to the removal of single-use plastic film from New York City streets, and its reconstitution into something beautiful, unique, and long-lasting.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our budget:</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Plastic degrades, but it doesn’t biodegrade.  This means that plastic microfibers not only permeate the soil, air, and water system but also become increasingly toxic over time because they absorb other contaminants and get passed up the food chain by animals. In New York City, plastic film poses an even more pressing problem because this toxic material is not recyclable through the city's recycling program. In addition, plastic film which gets put in recycle bins by well-meaning citizens ends up clogging recycling machinery, reducing the efficiency of the whole city's recycling. Residents of New York State discard 23 billion plastic bags annually. In NYC in 2017, 122 pounds of plastic film per household went into the waste stream. Multiply that by 7 million households--it's a serious issue. Most of this plastic use will not be addressed by the city's exception-filled 2020 plastic bag ban.</p>
<p>Our upcycling program aims to address this not only by reducing the volume of plastic which blights our streets and curbside waste, but also transforming that plastic into high-quality, long-lasting goods which serve a practical function, project individuality and creativity, and raise awareness, all at once. By contributing to our infrastructure upgrade, you will directly increase our ability and capacity to collect this destructive material and to educate and elevate our community.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This undertaking is inherently risky: we believe our plastic material is important and valuable, but market forces can be merciless. In order to have a real impact with this project, we need to make sure we have an efficient, effective, clean, and safe workspace, and we need to work with others to gather single-use plastic which has been or will be discarded. Our challenges are to make strong and long-lasting facility improvements, and cultivate a supportive network. Our work is just one organ in the body of a sustainable economy, so we need to make sure we do our job right, and that we meet the needs of our community! Thankfully, we have staff with expert knowledge in building to make sure our workshop gets outfitted just right, and strong relationships with local canners and businesspeople, who will help us with sourcing.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you're unable to donate, please spread the word about this project! Alternately, if you're in NYC, come visit us and volunteer! If you know someone who might be interested in using our material, or who works with plastic film and doesn't know what to do with it all, put them in touch with us!</p>
<p>The more people are talking and thinking about the materials and practices which tend to be taken for granted, the more awareness will organically spread, and the more changes will become evident in the culture. No effort is too small!</p>

<h3>Resumen</h3>
<p>“Sure We Can” es un centro de reciclaje sostenible y de apoyo de continuidad sin ánimo de lucro en Bushwick, Brooklyn. Hemos proporcionado por once años un espacio comunitario por los lateros (personas que recogen latas, botellas y otros envases ya utilizados) donde se puede reunir y trabajar en paz y con dignidad. Además de promover  empleo y trabajo decente, lo vemos como nuestra responsabilidad de aplicar creatividad y esfuerzo en combatir el cambio climático enfocándonos en los problemas de consumo y desechos. </p>
<p>Este año, vamos a enfocar nuestra atención en el problema de lámina de plástico de un solo uso, que es un problema para recicladoras en Nueva York y en todo el mundo. Está en todo lugar, restaurantes, minoristas, farmacias y otros innumerable sitios. La prohibición de bolsas de plástico del 2020 de NYC representa un paso adelante, importante en la buena dirección, pero no es suficiente. Las excepciones de los mayoristas, entregas de restaurantes, y otros significa que la lámina de plástico va a seguir en la ciudad llenando nuestras calles y obstruyendo los centros de reciclaje. </p>
<p>Queremos abordar este problema con creatividad comenzando con la colección de lámina de plástico de un solo uso; consumidores y negocios locales que no quieren enviarlas al vertedero.  Después, convertiremos la lámina en folios durables de material único. Este plástico nuevo podría ser usado para muchos propósitos: bolsas, accesorios, o para incorporar en proyectos creativos.

<p> </p>
<p>Por ahora, solamente podemos operar en una pequena escala. Necesitamos actualizar nuestro taller para que podamos tener un impacto en el problema de lámina de plástico. Las actualizaciones permitirá aumentar nuestra capacidad de producción y colección. Donar a este proyecto es contribuir directamente a la eliminación de lámina de plástico de un solo uso en NYC y la creación de algo precioso, único, y duradero. </p>

<h3>Impacto</h3>
<p>El plástico perdura en el medio ambiente por largos periodos de tiempo y no puede descomponerse completamente. La energía de rayos ultravioleta rompe el plástico que se desperdicia creando microplásticos. Ahora tenemos evidencia que existen estos microplásticos en la tierra, el aire, y el agua en cada parte del mundo. Además, el plástico actúa como un imán en sustancias tóxicas. Cuando esta ingerido por animales, puede hallarse en toda la cadena alimentaria. El problema de lámina de plástico es muy significante en NYC porque no es reciclable en las instalaciones de reciclaje de la ciudad.  </p>
<p>En adición, las láminas de plástico que está reciclado en una papelera de reciclaje obstruyen las máquinas y reduce la eficiencia de el reciclaje de toda la ciudad. Los residentes del estado de Nueva York desechan 23 billones de bolsas de plástico cada año. En NYC en 2017, 122 libras de lámina de plástico entró al flujo de desechos de cada vivienda. Multiplica eso por 7 millones de viviendas- es un problema grave. La prohibición de bolsas de plástico del 2020 de NYC no va a afectar a la mayoría de los que usan plástico. </p>
<p>Con nuestro programa estamos tratando de combatir este problema no solamente reduciendo el volumen de plástico, pero también transformandolo en productos durables y bien hechos que pueden tener una función práctica, proyectar individualidad, y crear conciencia. Con su contribución puede ayudarnos a crecer directamente nuestra capacidad de coleccionar el material destructivo y educar y elevar nuestra comunidad.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Riesgos y Desafíos</h3>
<p>Creemos que nuestro material plástico es importante y valioso y que las fuerzas del mercado podrían ser despiadados. Para tener un impacto significante con este proyecto, necesitamos estar seguros que tenemos un taller eficiente, efectivo, y limpio. También necesitamos trabajar coleccionando plásticos de sólo un uso que ya ha sido desechado. Tenemos el desafío de realizar mejoramientos sólidos y duraderos y desarrollar nuestra comunidad de apoyo. Nuestro trabajo es solamente una parte pequeña de una gran economía sostenible. Por eso, necesitamos estar seguros de hacer bien nuestro trabajo y satisfacer las necesidades de nuestra comunidad. Afortunadamente, tenemos un experto trabajando con nosotros quién puede asegurar que nuestro taller está perfectamente completo! También, ya tenemos relaciones fuertes con lateros y empresarios locales que van a ayudarnos con el abastecimiento.</p>

Summary
Sure We Can is a redemption center and sustainability hub in Bushwick, Brooklyn, which has been serving the community for 11 years. In addition to providing container-deposit redemption service, we view it as our responsibility to apply our effort and creativity to the worsening problems of consumption and waste in general, the consequences of which are exacerbating climate change and making the world a less clean, safe, and healthy place for our families.
This year, we've applied ourselves to the issue of single-use plastic film, which frustrates recyclers in New York City and across the world. It's ubiquitous, being used in restaurants, retailers, pharmacies, and in innumerable other places. NYC's 2020 plastic bag ban is a step in the right direction but is not close to sufficient: exceptions for wholesalers, restaurant delivery, and others mean plastic film will remain a part of our city's landscape, continuing to blight our streets and clog our recycling centers.
Sure We Can aims to address this creatively by first collecting single-use plastic film from consumers who don't wish to send it to the landfill, and also from local businesses, then ""upcycling"" it into sheets of durable, one-of-a-kind material. This new plastic can be used for all sorts of purposes: fabricated into reusable bags, sewn into clothing or accessories, or incorporated into new artistic or creative projects. Check out our first partnership, with Brooklyn designer Zero Waste Daniel: https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/caitochs/t...
With our current setup, we can only operate on a very small scale. In order to make a meaningful impact on the plastic film problem we need to make upgrades to our workshop facility. These changes will permit us to scale up our collection and production capacity, while also increasing our efficiency. By donating to this project, you will be contributing directly to the removal of single-use plastic film from New York City streets, and its reconstitution into something beautiful, unique, and long-lasting.
 

What We Need & What You Get
Our budget:
New heat press: $650
Floor leveling, weather-proofing, electrical improvements, materials/labor: $2500
Fan ventilation system install, purchase/labor: $300
Industrial sewing machine and 15,000 yds of thread: $600
Laboratory scale, .01g: $150
Workshop tools, including rotary cutters, mats, and lighting: $300
Buffer for contingencies, additional labor costs, and Indiegogo's cut: $500
 
With these needs fulfilled, we'll be in a position to meet our incoming production demands. In addition, by contributing, you can participate in our project in a tangible way! Starting with gifts as low as $10, you can be a real part of our work, from having your name painted on our donor wall, to commissioning a custom piece of material, or even coming to learn the process for yourself. Our aim is to include you in our team of world-changers!
If we are unable to reach our goal, we will use the funds to do what facility improvements we can. Our budget is prioritized with most important on top, least important below, and we will follow that guide, using the resources available to us. If we surpass our goal, we will use the additional funds to take the next steps in our project: to pay for the labor required to design and create prototypes of reusable bags, wallets, and other accessories.

Plastic degrades, but it doesn’t biodegrade.  This means that plastic microfibers not only permeate the soil, air, and water system but also become increasingly toxic over time because they absorb other contaminants and get passed up the food chain by animals.

The more people are talking and thinking about the materials and practices which tend to be taken for granted, the more awareness will organically spread, and the more changes will become evident in the culture. No effort is too small!

That is 25,000 bottles plus another 15,000 bottles to make our 4-packs. After this initial order is placed and made available, the buzz that has already started will spread. We will prove truly safe, effective and eco-friendly cleaning products exist.  You will have helped change the expectations for the industry, eliminated thousands, if not millions, of plastic bottles from being thrown away, and helped to make our homes safer places for our families.   If we are unable to reach our goal, this dream... which has sparked revolutionary change in how we treat ourselves and our planet will end much to soon.   Join EE in the movement to reduce and reuse!  Other Ways You Can Help

More details... if you are still reading and want more background / philosophy / history

As a McKinney North Chemistry Teacher, with experience in developmental 
intervention, I was familiar with the research linking hidden chemicals 
to increasing developmental and health issues. So, I started to create 
truly safe cleaning products. The products turned out to be amazing. The
 number of people requesting these safer, greener alternatives exploded,
 and Elemental Essentialz was born.

The idea to choose reused wine bottles came to me in a restaurant as I watched bottle 
after bottle, go from table to trash. The decision was ground breaking. 
It was also messy, and a little humbling, but with one simple choice EE 
would minimize the need for plastic, decrease energy consumption due to 
production by over 90%, and virtually eliminate packaging waste.

The bigger picture - our philosophy:
 We very quickly realized, our good idea had become many great ideas.  
Elemental Essentialz is more than a business making and selling 
products.  Ours is an 
effort to help consumers bridge the gap between knowing what is right 
and being able to achieve it. We are a new company, revisiting an older 
way of doing business. We are excited and driven by our mission - to 
improve health, minimize energy consumption, and decrease waste. Join EE in our 
movement to Reduce and Reuse!  Why? You know its right. And we are here to help.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p></p>
<h2><b>the
why:</b></h2>
<h3><b>the
incredibly different nonprofit organization:</b></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: left;""><strong></strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>the definition of sustainability is
the capacity to endure. we have created an organization that will help people
save money, be better stewards of our planet, live a sustainable lifestyle and
help people that can not help themselves. we feel that passion, enthusiasm and
sheer drive paired with a diverse culture designed within a sustainable belief
system is one of the most powerful tools we have to create change; nrgeneration
has been designed with this in mind every step of the way. our team consists of
like minded, multi-disciplined and highly talented individuals with a
“solutions not excuses” mentality.</p>
<p>NRGeneration is an organization
founded by social entrepreneurs dedicated to the mission of making
sustainability viral. we are a nonprofit branding, sales, marketing,
educational and humanitarian institution that covers the entire sprectrum of
green products, services and information. in the past these concepts have been
tried in pieces but never as a whole. the purpose in running this campaign is
to define our company to individuals, businesses and organizations that have
the same vision we do and that want to get behind a very dynamic group of
people with the ability to evoke change. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>o<strong>ur vision:</strong>
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>NRGeneration’s vision is to start a
revolution within sustainability. simply put, our mission statement is: “to
make sustainability viral!” we truly think everyone has a general awareness of the
problems and issues going on, but until they are presented simple, cost effective
solutions there isn’t any motivation to change. our team is focused on bringing
solutions to these problems to the american public.</p>
<p>our vision for this organization is to
provide one place people can go for the latest and most up to date information
on green technology, building processes and trends. we want to provide the
american consumer with one stop shopping for all of their needs from green home
products, d.i.y. sustainable technology, renewable energy, energy efficient
retrofitting, home building and energy efficient financing. for example, very
few people realize that energy efficient financing is available. this knowledge
will alleviate first cost pushback and allow them to roll it into the mortgage
and actually have a positive cash flow when the project is finished. if done
properly a person can pay their home off up to 10 years earlier or even save
enough money to help send a kid to college. with the rising costs of basically
everything, especially energy, there is no time like the present and no other
organization that offers this to consumers. </p>
<p>our organization is partnered with
some of the largest distribution companies, green manufacturers and green
advocacy organizations in america. we did this to ensure consumers would get
the best of everything including the lowest prices, most up to date
information, best financing rates and the best experience possible. the most
important thing that we have done is ensured that a percentage of all
transactions originating from nrgeneration will be donated to our foundation.  these donations will be in the clients name so
that even the less fortunate will be afforded the gift of sustainability. we
intend on using these donations to retrofit or build homes for low income
families, the elderly, wounded american heroes and sick children. giving back
is our whole intention…</p>

why:
the
incredibly different nonprofit organization:


the definition of sustainability is
the capacity to endure. we have created an organization that will help people
save money, be better stewards of our planet, live a sustainable lifestyle and
help people that can not help themselves. we feel that passion, enthusiasm and
sheer drive paired with a diverse culture designed within a sustainable belief
system is one of the most powerful tools we have to create change; nrgeneration
has been designed with this in mind every step of the way. our team consists of
like minded, multi-disciplined and highly talented individuals with a
“solutions not excuses” mentality.
NRGeneration is an organization
founded by social entrepreneurs dedicated to the mission of making
sustainability viral. we are a nonprofit branding, sales, marketing,
educational and humanitarian institution that covers the entire sprectrum of
green products, services and information. in the past these concepts have been
tried in pieces but never as a whole. the purpose in running this campaign is
to define our company to individuals, businesses and organizations that have
the same vision we do and that want to get behind a very dynamic group of
people with the ability to evoke change. 


our vision:



NRGeneration’s vision is to start a
revolution within sustainability. simply put, our mission statement is: “to
make sustainability viral!” we truly think everyone has a general awareness of the
problems and issues going on, but until they are presented simple, cost effective
solutions there isn’t any motivation to change. our team is focused on bringing
solutions to these problems to the american public.
our vision for this organization is to
provide one place people can go for the latest and most up to date information
on green technology, building processes and trends. we want to provide the
american consumer with one stop shopping for all of their needs from green home
products, d.i.y. sustainable technology, renewable energy, energy efficient
retrofitting, home building and energy efficient financing. for example, very
few people realize that energy efficient financing is available. this knowledge
will alleviate first cost pushback and allow them to roll it into the mortgage
and actually have a positive cash flow when the project is finished. if done
properly a person can pay their home off up to 10 years earlier or even save
enough money to help send a kid to college. with the rising costs of basically
everything, especially energy, there is no time like the present and no other
organization that offers this to consumers. 
our organization is partnered with
some of the largest distribution companies, green manufacturers and green
advocacy organizations in america. we did this to ensure consumers would get
the best of everything including the lowest prices, most up to date
information, best financing rates and the best experience possible. the most
important thing that we have done is ensured that a percentage of all
transactions originating from nrgeneration will be donated to our foundation.  these donations will be in the clients name so
that even the less fortunate will be afforded the gift of sustainability. we
intend on using these donations to retrofit or build homes for low income
families, the elderly, wounded american heroes and sick children. giving back
is our whole intention…

<p><i><strong>What is 2041? What is the IAE? Why is it important?</strong></i></p>
<p>2041 is an NGO founded by Robert Swan, OBE –the first person to walk to both the North and South Poles. Its mission is to “inform, engage and inspire the next generation of leaders to take responsibility, be sustainable, and know that now is the time for action in policy development, sustainable business generation and future<br/>technologies.” Its key and main goal is to ensure that the last great wilderness on Earth is never exploited for commercial, military or other reasons besides science and education. 2041 aims to do this by transforming the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty from a temporary agreement into a perpetual moratorium.<br/></p>
<p>The International Antarctic Expedition (IAE) is one of its key events throughout the year. It is an endeavor that brings together representatives from the industry, other NGOs and education institutions from the world round for a two week “Leadership on the Edge” program. Throughout this time, participants are challenged to think<br/>differently and generate new ideas and initiatives to help drive sustainability<br/>back at their homes while absorbing foremost knowledge regarding the<br/>environment and ways to make our relationship with the planet work.<br/></p>
<p><i><strong>Who are you funding?</strong></i></p>
<p>You are funding three people across the world who have developed a friendship on account of a shared passion: environment and sustainability. We met through work –more specifically, through a network of colleagues who attended last year’s<br/>IAE.<span>  We are all business consultants, and we are passionate about using the skills we have learned through work to help craft solutions for social and environmental issues we feel strongly about.</span></p>
<p><u>Siddharth Sastri (New Delhi)</u></p>
<p><i>“Hello! My name is Siddharth Sastri and I’ve just finished my first year at Bain &amp; Company’s New Delhi office. I grew up in India, and then did my undergraduate studies at Brown University in the US. Growing up, I’ve always been very interested in environmental sustainability and been involved in a number of different initiatives around that. However, when I went to the US and then returned to India, I realized that there was a huge difference in how low a priority the environment was in India, and the comparative lack of measures to combat the rising carbon footprint. I believe<br/>that this expedition offers me a huge opportunity to be surrounded by leaders<br/>in this space, and return to India armed with an arsenal of possible<br/>initiatives to improve our sustainability.”</i></p>
<p><u>Luba Mandzy Herring (London)</u></p>
<p><i>“Hello!<span>  I’m Luba, and I’ve been at Bain and Company for over 5 years.  Before that, I spent many years studying the relationship between humans and the environment.  Early backyard science experiments and home recycling attempts evolved into an undergraduate degree in Environmental Science and Public Policy at Harvard, where I studied the impact of land use on climate change, focusing on logging practices in the Brazilian Amazon.  I then continued this passion at Oxford with a PhD in Mongolia looking at how climate and humans have influenced the evolution of the Central Asian landscape. I’m now excited to join a group of passionate leaders on an expedition to the end of the world – and to the limits of our knowledge – to explore what we can do to conserve the precious ecosystems we live in.”</span></i></p>
<p><u>Diego Argüelles (Mexico City)</u></p>
<p><i>“I’m Diego, born and raised in Mexico City, a<br/>place that once held the horrid claim of being one of the most polluted places<br/>on Earth. I remember growing and being often prevented from doing sports<br/>outside lest the air pollution would mess with our lungs. It was in part<br/>because of this that, ever since I can remember, I have had an extreme love for<br/>the outdoors and the wild. Throughout my life I’ve had the good fortune of<br/>seeing some incredible places on this world: mountains, forests, rivers and<br/>valleys. Yet, for all that good fortune, I’ve also seen how they have been<br/>devastated continuously by the way we envision progress and business. Now, I’m<br/>at a place where I can have an impact, a true, hard impact.

<p><i><strong>What will we be doing throughout the program?</strong></i></p>
<p>First of all, we will be taking part in Robert Swan’s “Leadership on the Edge” leadership, education, survival and sustainability program set in the last great wilderness on Earth along with over 70 business and social sector leaders from more than 20 different countries.</p>
<p>Secondly, we will be volunteering our time to help the 2041 team<br/>design and implement a series of workshops based on our personal and<br/>professional experience. These workshops are aimed at helping the attendees discover inspirational models of leadership and effective ways to deliver and sustain<br/>change.</p>
<p>Finally, we will be conducting 1-to-1 sessions with the attendees to personally coach and help them polish their innovative plans for sustainability initiatives they intend to implement in their home countries. Whether they plan to increase recycling or implement sustainable sourcing of materials, we are committed to ensuring that each initiative leaves the boat with its very own “Results Plan” and for each fellow expedition member to maximize their impact upon returning home. After the expedition, we will continue providing support to these and other initiatives created by members on the “2041 Global Network”.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Last year, a group of friends who also share our passion, attended the IAE 2013. Throughout the program they delivered workshops and 1-to-1 sessions with all the attendees –similar to what we will be doing this year. Following from last year’s<br/>mission, there are now ~70 environmental, corporate and community social impact<br/>projects underway. </p>
<p>Here are some comments about last year’s 1-to-1 sessions:</p>
<p><i>“The time spent individually makes a lot of difference and this remains the highlight of the program.”</i></p>
<p><i>“It is very practical, enables one to break down a big project into small manageable tasks and one can easily review their job against objectives set to be achieved based on the time allocated.”</i></p>
<p><i>“Impeccable.<span> Shout outs to each one of you! You all were experts. It was a joy<br/>travelling and learning with you all. The entire team was professional and<br/>well-informed. They all are very passionate about their jobs and it shows with<br/>their commitment.”</span></i></p>
<p>We expect to build on their great success and continue helping people with passion to structure and implement their own initiatives. Also, our intention is to take this<br/>opportunity to learn about cutting edge thinking in the sustainability issues that trouble our world and take this knowledge to create our own initiatives. Our final goal is to implement these initiatives and ultimately incorporate all our learning into our daily lives and work. </p>

2041 is an NGO founded by Robert Swan, OBE –the first person to walk to both the North and South Poles. Its mission is to “inform, engage and inspire the next generation of leaders to take responsibility, be sustainable, and know that now is the time for action in policy development, sustainable business generation and futuretechnologies.” Its key and main goal is to ensure that the last great wilderness on Earth is never exploited for commercial, military or other reasons besides science and education. 2041 aims to do this by transforming the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty from a temporary agreement into a perpetual moratorium.
The International Antarctic Expedition (IAE) is one of its key events throughout the year. It is an endeavor that brings together representatives from the industry, other NGOs and education institutions from the world round for a two week “Leadership on the Edge” program. Throughout this time, participants are challenged to thinkdifferently and generate new ideas and initiatives to help drive sustainabilityback at their homes while absorbing foremost knowledge regarding theenvironment and ways to make our relationship with the planet work.
Who are you funding?
You are funding three people across the world who have developed a friendship on account of a shared passion: environment and sustainability. We met through work –more specifically, through a network of colleagues who attended last year’sIAE.  We are all business consultants, and we are passionate about using the skills we have learned through work to help craft solutions for social and environmental issues we feel strongly about.
Siddharth Sastri (New Delhi)
“Hello! My name is Siddharth Sastri and I’ve just finished my first year at Bain & Company’s New Delhi office. I grew up in India, and then did my undergraduate studies at Brown University in the US. Growing up, I’ve always been very interested in environmental sustainability and been involved in a number of different initiatives around that. However, when I went to the US and then returned to India, I realized that there was a huge difference in how low a priority the environment was in India, and the comparative lack of measures to combat the rising carbon footprint. I believethat this expedition offers me a huge opportunity to be surrounded by leadersin this space, and return to India armed with an arsenal of possibleinitiatives to improve our sustainability.”
Luba Mandzy Herring (London)
“Hello!  I’m Luba, and I’ve been at Bain and Company for over 5 years.  Before that, I spent many years studying the relationship between humans and the environment.  Early backyard science experiments and home recycling attempts evolved into an undergraduate degree in Environmental Science and Public Policy at Harvard, where I studied the impact of land use on climate change, focusing on logging practices in the Brazilian Amazon.  I then continued this passion at Oxford with a PhD in Mongolia looking at how climate and humans have influenced the evolution of the Central Asian landscape. I’m now excited to join a group of passionate leaders on an expedition to the end of the world – and to the limits of our knowledge – to explore what we can do to conserve the precious ecosystems we live in.”
Diego Argüelles (Mexico City)
“I’m Diego, born and raised in Mexico City, aplace that once held the horrid claim of being one of the most polluted placeson Earth. I remember growing and being often prevented from doing sportsoutside lest the air pollution would mess with our lungs. It was in partbecause of this that, ever since I can remember, I have had an extreme love forthe outdoors and the wild. Throughout my life I’ve had the good fortune ofseeing some incredible places on this world: mountains, forests, rivers andvalleys. Yet, for all that good fortune, I’ve also seen how they have beendevastated continuously by the way we envision progress and business. Now, I’mat a place where I can have an impact, a true, hard impact. With your help Iwill join Robert Swan in his mission to save Antarctica and connect with theworldwide 2041 network to push and implement sustainability initiatives.”
What will we be doing throughout the program?
First of all, we will be taking part in Robert Swan’s “Leadership on the Edge” leadership, education, survival and sustainability program set in the last great wilderness on Earth along with over 70 business and social sector leaders from more than 20 different countries.

<h3>The Supreme Court ruled that this poor 76-year-old farmer has to pay $84,456 to GMO multibillion dollar food giant Monsanto. Let's help him out - and show our solidarity!</h3>
<p>A poor 76 year old farmer, Vernon Hugh Bowman from Sandborn, Indiana had the courage and tenacity to fight Monsanto all the way to the Supreme Court, and says he doesn't have the money to pay the $84,456 he's been sued for. He barely makes ends meet, making do with old run-down tractors and second-hand seed from granaries.</p>
<p>Let's help help this farmer endure this ridiculous debt so he and his family don't suffer any more under the pressure of this evil lawsuit. It's important to stand united and not to let this farmer carry this burden by himself, because he has stood up for all of our rights to not have the world's food supply controlled by Monsanto.</p>
<div class=""kl"" dir=""ltr"" id="":1w8"">If people rally around him with support it will show that Farmer Bowman's got allies and show that Monsanto has a growing groundswell of enemies.</div>
<h3 class=""kl"" dir=""ltr"">Let's show how the People truly want our farmers treated.</h3>

<p><span>We agreed. So we're starting this fundraiser for Vernon Hugh Bowman, because he had the courage and tenacity in his ripe old age to fight Monsanto all the way to the Supreme Court for all of us, and we ought to show our solidarity with him.</span></p>
<p><strong>Net proceeds from this fundraiser will go to farmer Vernon Hugh Bowman </strong>(Indiegogo (not us) will take 9% plus transaction fees).</p>

<h3> </h3></span></div>","UPDATE: We had a call with farmer Vernon H. Bowman, who was sued by Monsanto, to present him with the money you've helped raise for him. 
Here's a recording he made to thank you...A recorded message from farmer Vernon Hugh Bowman
The Supreme Court ruled that this poor 76-year-old farmer has to pay $84,456 to GMO multibillion dollar food giant Monsanto. Let's help him out - and show our solidarity!
A poor 76 year old farmer, Vernon Hugh Bowman from Sandborn, Indiana had the courage and tenacity to fight Monsanto all the way to the Supreme Court, and says he doesn't have the money to pay the $84,456 he's been sued for. He barely makes ends meet, making do with old run-down tractors and second-hand seed from granaries.
Let's help help this farmer endure this ridiculous debt so he and his family don't suffer any more under the pressure of this evil lawsuit. It's important to stand united and not to let this farmer carry this burden by himself, because he has stood up for all of our rights to not have the world's food supply controlled by Monsanto.
If people rally around him with support it will show that Farmer Bowman's got allies and show that Monsanto has a growing groundswell of enemies.
Let's show how the People truly want our farmers treated.
Let Monsanto know they can’t bully family farms into extinction. 
Please share this everywhere you can.
Let's rally together and stand up to giant corporations who want to control our food supplies and our governments.
Yesterday someone on UPRISER.com suggested we ""help this farmer pay this ridiculous amount of money. I feel it's so important to stand united and not to let this farmer carry this ridiculousness by himself.""
We agreed. So we're starting this fundraiser for Vernon Hugh Bowman, because he had the courage and tenacity in his ripe old age to fight Monsanto all the way to the Supreme Court for all of us, and we ought to show our solidarity with him.
Net proceeds from this fundraiser will go to farmer Vernon Hugh Bowman (Indiegogo (not us) will take 9% plus transaction fees).
UPDATE: We finally got to speak with Vernon Hugh Bowman and he says he doesn't want to take the money, because he doesn't want it to go to Monsanto. He said instead he'd like it to go to a cause aligned with his ideals. When asked if he had a family member who he wanted the money to go to, he said he didn't want that because he thought it would be ""dishonorable."" So for the moment we have established an UPRISER Vernon Hugh Bowman fund which will be directed by the farmer himself. It could go towards anything from a cause that Mr. Bowman likes, to maybe buying him some seed that won't get him in trouble next planting season. Stay tuned. ;)
Mr. Bowman also would also like some help in a legal matter pertaining to the damages he's on the hook for, so if you know someone who can help him, please email help@upriser.com with ""Farmer Bowman"" in the subject line.
Your gift goes where this farmer directs it, for his own personal use. He may still refuse to give the money to Monsanto, and probably will try.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>""Our Wet Dream"" is an initiative geared towards making clean water accessible to villages all throughout Cambodia. Myself and a group of nine girlfriends are rolling up our sleeves and heading out east, in June, to empower the people, the land, and the way of life in these impoverished areas. Our fundraising will go towards building wells that will bring lifelong access to clean water for hundreds. These will be built and maintained by local Cambodians. This way they can sustain themselves long after we head back home. Some seriously incredible multi-tasking will be taking place. Aside from our well building initiatives, we're also setting out on cultural awareness missions to introduce the community to their new means of water.  By teaching hygiene classes, providing hand-on tutorials, and educating the communities, predominantly the children. We are hoping to bring a positive change that's been needed for years. Basic education like the importance of washing hands, brushing teeth, clean laundry, and hygiene upkeep. These efforts will lower the outbreak of diseases and offer a much healthier lifestyle.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>""There comes a time when one must risk everything, or sit forever with their dreams."" Like my good friend Martin Luther King, Jr. I, too, had a dream. Mine involved the capabilities of numerous well-minded people driven toward one common goal. This dream drew upon contribution of a lot of hands in the pot. It was all fueled by CHANGE. This dream was dirty. And water, water was an intricate part to the dream… I guess you could say… I had a “wet” dream.</p>
<p>Water is something we use every day, numerous times a day, in many forms and activities. It’s the essence of life, we wouldn’t be able to live with out it. My dream was to bring access to clean water to all parts of the world.</p>
<p>The only thing is... this won't happen unless you help!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<br/>Well as much as we wish you could tag along... (We'll have to save that for the next dream mission. There will be plenty more to come, so stay tuned.) Our efforts in Cambodia can't happen alone. Financially the wells are quite an investment. We would greatly appreciate anything you can give that could help us get one step closer to making this CHANGE an actuality.<br/><br/>Each of us women who are embarking on this project made a pact to raise $3,000. This way between all of us we would have $30,000 to build and educate!  Each well costs around $375, so together we could be bringing water to several villages across Cambodia.<br/><br/>To involve all of you I put together certain perks for each donated amount. Unfortunately, I don't have a surplus of extra change laying around to offer you material gifts such as a custom made ""Wet dream"" logoed pair of underwear or ""wet T-shirt"" contest winner badges. Our funds are short, that is exactly why we are asking for your help in the first place! :) Makes sense, right? Okay.. I'm just checking.<br/><br/>

in order to avoid conflicts between communities as well as dangerous animals. In
turn, this restricts the movement of species such as elephants, potentially leading
to excessive habitat damage within reserves where elephant feeding pressure is
too high. One approach being used by reserve managers is to expand the areas
accessible to elephants. In KwaZulu Natal, a project called Space for Elephants
is trying to persuade private game reserves to drop their fences in order to create
contiguous areas. Similarly, in the Thanda Reserve, they have done just that;
and now there are parts of the reserve where elephants have inhabited for a
long period, parts where elephants recently gained access in 2009, and new areas
where elephants were introduced in 2011. Dropping fences allow elephants
to expand their ranges, but also affects the distribution of other herbivores
and predators. Private reserves constitute over 60% of the protected areas in
South Africa, so projects such as these that encourage cooperation between the reserves
through mutually beneficial practices are hugely important for conservation
management within southern Africa.<span style="""">  </span></font></span></font></font></p>

</div></div>","In the summer of 2012, with your help, I will be boarding a flight
to South Africa to join Operation Wallacea (www.opwall.com)
in a unique opportunity to participate in elephant impact
surveys on the Thanda Reserve. I will be joining a small survey team comprised of both academics and volunteers obtaining
baseline data on the impact of the growth of
elephant populations on their surrounding habitat. While on the reserve, I will spend half the time in the field and take part in an Africa Wildlife Conservation course learning in detail the intricacies of how wildlife resources are managed and the major conservation issues currently being faced in the region.

WORD FROM THE HERD…

  A majority of big game areas in South Africa are fenced
in order to avoid conflicts between communities as well as dangerous animals. In
turn, this restricts the movement of species such as elephants, potentially leading
to excessive habitat damage within reserves where elephant feeding pressure is
too high. One approach being used by reserve managers is to expand the areas
accessible to elephants. In KwaZulu Natal, a project called Space for Elephants
is trying to persuade private game reserves to drop their fences in order to create
contiguous areas. Similarly, in the Thanda Reserve, they have done just that;
and now there are parts of the reserve where elephants have inhabited for a
long period, parts where elephants recently gained access in 2009, and new areas
where elephants were introduced in 2011. Dropping fences allow elephants
to expand their ranges, but also affects the distribution of other herbivores
and predators. Private reserves constitute over 60% of the protected areas in
South Africa, so projects such as these that encourage cooperation between the reserves
through mutually beneficial practices are hugely important for conservation
management within southern Africa.  

 

WHY YOU
SHOULD GIVE TWO PEANUTS ABOUT OPWALL…

Operation
Wallacea is a non-profit organization that operates biological and conservation
management research programs in remote locations within Indonesia, Honduras, South Africa and
Mozambique, Peru, Madagascar, Egypt, Guyana, Cuba, Mexico, and Romania. Opwall focuses
on implementing socially and environmentally responsible programs through academic partnerships. These projects provide local
communities with the education, training, and alternative sources of income
they need to get out of poverty and
conserve their environment. 

Furthermore, their hard work has resulted in a great number
of peer-reviewed publications each year and the DISCOVERY OF 30 VERTEBRATE
SPECIES NEW TO SCIENCE! Not to mention the re-discovery of 4 “extinct”
species!  


THE ELEPHANT
IN THE ROOM…

Flights
to South Africa are extremely expensive in the summer (equal to the amount of
the total cost of the month long expedition!). So far, I have raised approximately $1,000 through savings and fundraising activities; but with
being a new college grad, most of my hard-earned cash goes to student
loans! Something many of us can relate to, right!?  I've set a fundraising goal of $3,000 to cover the cost of the expedition...WILL YOU HELP ME?
I need all the help I can get from passionate supporters LIKE YOU  who are concerned with the welfare of Mother Nature’s amazing creatures and their habitats. Let's  continue efforts in effective wildlife research and conservation management! If not for me, for Dumbo J",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica; font-size: medium;""><span style="""">I'm a Haverford College senior interested in pursuing a career in conservation and environmental science. I became aware of the issue of snow leopard conservation in Central Asia and how this conservation directly and positively affects not only a highly endangered species, but the people who live in these areas as well. Through livestock vaccination, insurance and education programs, among others, this conservation is making a difference to people. There is also a potentially distructive natural gas pipeline being planed through a region of snow leopard habitat in the Altai Republic, part of which is a World Heritage site. </span></span><span style=""color: #333333; font-family: helvetica; font-size: medium; line-height: 20px;"">I am volunteering to go to the Altai Republic this summer to see how I can be involved with the conservation challenges. My goal is to take a video camera with me when I go and record footage that can be put into a short video on the internet to spread the word about wildlife conservation in Central Asia and how it relates to local people and cultures.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 20px; color: #333333; font-family: helvetica; font-size: medium;"">I'll be helping with some local conservation education projects in the very south of the Altai Republic near Kosh-Agach and the Argut Valley. Local Altai conservation projects there include an eco-camp of educational materials for visitors to understand more about the importance of the ecological issues. I will hopefully be able to share my ideas on these museums and also be part of a workshop on the making of felt souvineers that raise funds for local people. I'm hoping to witness the second ever Snow Leopard Day festival in Gorno-Altaisk and I may also get to spend some time in some schools in Kosh-Agach or Inegen getting involved with some environmental education with the children there. It would be good to hear their perspective on the issues. In addition, I will also be participating in an expedition in the same region with wildlife biologists to study local wildlife and track numbers, distributions, etc as well as look for signs of the elusive ghost-cat. It will be exciting to learn methods of field conservation research. </span></p>

The Impact

The snow leopard is a beautiful and highly endangered animal who in it's own right deserves our help, as do the many other threatened and endangered species of this region. Renown wildlife biologist George Schaller says it best in his wonderful book, Stones of Silence: ""As we reach for the stars we neglect the flowers at our feet. But the great age of mammals in the Himalaya need not to be over unless we permit it to be. For epochs to come the peaks will still pierce the lonely vistas, but when the last snow leopard has stalked among the crags and the last markhor has stood on a promontory, his ruff waving in the breeze, a spark of life will have gone, turning the mountains into stones of silence."" 


Snow leopards, recognized as a charasmatic face of environmental conservation in Central Asia and a vital keystone species in their ecosystem, are currently being exploited for their fur and their bones (used in some traditional Chinese medicines) and killed by local herders with whom they have historically had a negative relationship in conflict over livestock. There is no effective solution to these issues that does not address every aspect involved. Snow Leopard conservation organizations are taking a community-based approach to conservation through livestock vaccination programs, the development of alternative forms of income for herding families and the encouragement of eco-tourism, amoung others. 

But there is still a long way to go. Funding and personnel are limited and the regions in need of this conservation support are almost incomprehensibly vast. The BBC recently gave a World Challenge award to a snow leopard conservation program - Snow Leopard Enterprises - which works to build a program of alternative income for households through the creation of traditional felt crafts and it has been a huge success in Mongolia; success which could be duplicated in many other areas as well. 


The planned natural gas pipeline would cut a devistating swath accross an Altai World Heritage site of endangered species as well as the minority cultural group who would loose a part of their cultural heritage in this process. This is to say nothing of the additional damage done, were this pipe to be damaged by one of the earthquakes that are fairly frequent in this region.

The book will be available in April 2017.</p>
<p>Perhaps you're already familiar with my photography and animal advocacy through the <a href=""http://www.weanimals.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">We Animals</a> project, which is my life’s work documenting animal use and abuse around the globe. My first book, entitled <a href=""https://lanternbooks.presswarehouse.com/books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=375782"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>We Animals</i></a>, was published by Lantern Books in January 2014.<br/><br/>Lantern and I are very happy to be announcing this new and important project. <strong>In over one hundred photographs, <i>Captive</i> reveals the lives of animals in zoos and aquaria around the world.</strong> I've photographed animals in these situations for over a decade now, and the book will include images from over 20 countries on five continents, shot most recently in the last year while I was working with <a href=""http://www.bornfree.org.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Born Free Foundation</a> in Europe. The final pictures have been chosen, the text has been written, and the design, by Paul Shoebridge of <a href=""http://www.thegoggles.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Goggles</a>, is on its way to completion.</p>
<p><i>Captive</i> comes with essays by myself; by <a href=""http://www.bornfree.org.uk/about-us/staff/virginia-mckennas-office/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Virginia McKenna</a>, co-founder of the <a href=""http://www.bornfree.org.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Born Free Foundation</a>; and by philosopher <a href=""http://www.lorigruen.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lori Gruen</a>, editor of <a href=""http://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-ethics-of-captivity-9780199978007?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Ethics of Captivity</a>, and author of <a href=""http://lanternbooks.presswarehouse.com/books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=438993"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Entangled Empathy</a>.</p>
<p>I hope you'll watch the video we've made to get a sense of the images and purpose of this project, and then consider pre-ordering your copy and sharing this campaign. Doing so, will facilitate the production, printing, and distribution of this full-color paperback with flaps. The book will retail for $35, which means we're giving a $5 discount on one book, and more on multiple copies.<br/><br/><strong>We’re at an important point in history right now. More than ever, ordinary people are thinking about the ethics of keeping animals in captivity for our entertainment.

</div></div>","Hi, my name is Jo-Anne McArthur and I'm a photojournalist and author. I'm reaching out to you  because Martin Rowe at Lantern Books and I are publishing another book together, entitled Captive. The book will be available in April 2017.
Perhaps you're already familiar with my photography and animal advocacy through the We Animals project, which is my life’s work documenting animal use and abuse around the globe. My first book, entitled We Animals, was published by Lantern Books in January 2014.Lantern and I are very happy to be announcing this new and important project. In over one hundred photographs, Captive reveals the lives of animals in zoos and aquaria around the world. I've photographed animals in these situations for over a decade now, and the book will include images from over 20 countries on five continents, shot most recently in the last year while I was working with The Born Free Foundation in Europe. The final pictures have been chosen, the text has been written, and the design, by Paul Shoebridge of The Goggles, is on its way to completion.
Captive comes with essays by myself; by Virginia McKenna, co-founder of the Born Free Foundation; and by philosopher Lori Gruen, editor of The Ethics of Captivity, and author of Entangled Empathy.
I hope you'll watch the video we've made to get a sense of the images and purpose of this project, and then consider pre-ordering your copy and sharing this campaign. Doing so, will facilitate the production, printing, and distribution of this full-color paperback with flaps. The book will retail for $35, which means we're giving a $5 discount on one book, and more on multiple copies.We’re at an important point in history right now. More than ever, ordinary people are thinking about the ethics of keeping animals in captivity for our entertainment. This reflection will help propel us into a new era of (re)considering our relationship with other animals. Captive aims to be a part of these important discussions.Thank you for your continued support!Warmly,Jo-Anne McArthur

<p>This year for my birthday I am asking you to join me in our <b>Eco-Karma Yoga Campaign</b> to save our beautiful yet imperilled oceans! Come celebrate my birthday and dive into the experience of a lifetime.  Our goal: to <b>Redefine “Restorative Yoga:”</b>  Restore your body while restoring our oceans.</p>
<p>The ocean is a shrine of interconnection and an essential source of life on this planet. As a surfer, I see first hand the detrimental effects humans are having on the ocean.</p>
<p>Especially now as I get older, I cannot spend another day without doing something about it.  My goal is to restore 2 sq. km of our imperiled coral reefs in <b>Key Largo, Florida</b> this year. </p>That’s why on <b>December 5th, 6th and 7th </b>I am offering <b>FREE daily Blissology yoga, </b>meditation and philosophy in exchange for you helping me transplant coral for the <a href=""http://www.coralrestoration.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Coral Restoration Foundations</a> </div><div style="""">
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">
</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>You can <b>JOIN ME IN PERSON</b>, roll up your sleeves to transplant coral in
Florida <b>OR DONATE HERE </b>to become an “Eco Karma yogi.”  <br/><br/>
Karma is the offering of unselfish service – our offering to the world. I want
us to connect our love for ecology with both the physical yoga practice and selfless
service of Karma yoga.  </p>
<p><b>We need your help
to reach our goal of $15,000 to fund this Eco-Karma coral reef restoration
projects.</b></p>
<p>To help us get there and make your contributions go a little further, Lululemon is generously matching every dollar raised by Eoin/Blissology up to $25,000CAD<br/></p>
<p>Love is the Ultimate Renewable Resource!</p>
<p>
</p>
<h1>Why the Coral Reefs?</h1>
<p>
<span>We are so intimately connected to the ocean.  Every tear and every drop of sweat comes and
goes from the ocean. Every second breath we take is
produced by  plankton in our Oceans. It is the source of countless life
forms. The Coral Reefs are like the rain
forests of the ocean.  They cover a mere
1% of the ocean floor yet astoundingly they are home to approximately 25% of
all marine life! Today
coral reefs around the world are in danger.  Some estimates show how approximately 10% of the
world's coral reefs are dead<del>, </del>and about
60% of the world's reefs are at risk due to human-related
activities. By the 2030s, 90% of reefs
are expected to be at risk from both human activities and climate change<strike>.</strike></span></p>
Let’s do something about
this now! Let’s leave a legacy of positive change for the oceans of past and
future generations. <b>Connect to your Higher Porpoise! </b>Let’s

The ocean is a shrine of interconnection and an essential source of life on this planet. As a surfer, I see first hand the detrimental effects humans are having on the ocean.
Especially now as I get older, I cannot spend another day without doing something about it.  My goal is to restore 2 sq. km of our imperiled coral reefs in Key Largo, Florida this year. That’s why on December 5th, 6th and 7th I am offering FREE daily Blissology yoga, meditation and philosophy in exchange for you helping me transplant coral for the Coral Restoration Foundations 



You can JOIN ME IN PERSON, roll up your sleeves to transplant coral in
Florida OR DONATE HERE to become an “Eco Karma yogi.”  
Karma is the offering of unselfish service – our offering to the world. I want
us to connect our love for ecology with both the physical yoga practice and selfless
service of Karma yoga.  
We need your help
to reach our goal of $15,000 to fund this Eco-Karma coral reef restoration
projects.
To help us get there and make your contributions go a little further, Lululemon is generously matching every dollar raised by Eoin/Blissology up to $25,000CAD
Love is the Ultimate Renewable Resource!


Why the Coral Reefs?

We are so intimately connected to the ocean.  Every tear and every drop of sweat comes and
goes from the ocean. Every second breath we take is
produced by  plankton in our Oceans. It is the source of countless life
forms. The Coral Reefs are like the rain
forests of the ocean.  They cover a mere
1% of the ocean floor yet astoundingly they are home to approximately 25% of
all marine life! Today
coral reefs around the world are in danger.  Some estimates show how approximately 10% of the
world's coral reefs are dead, and about
60% of the world's reefs are at risk due to human-related
activities. By the 2030s, 90% of reefs
are expected to be at risk from both human activities and climate change.
Let’s do something about
this now! Let’s leave a legacy of positive change for the oceans of past and
future generations. Connect to your Higher Porpoise! Let’s
deepen our connection to each other and restore our bodies while restoring the
ocean this December in Key Largo, Florida. 
Blissology is about tuning into the the wisdom of our innermost heart so we can stay connected to not just our bodies but to our personal relationships and to our communities and to Nature.  We plan to celebrate Nature and community in a big way with this project
 Help Us Reach $15,000!We've put together some Limited Edition Blissology Ocean Karma Sticker Packs, + lululemon Tees & Tanks with a custom illustration hand drawn by Eoin Finn as a perk for your contributions.

<div>Since 1989, Itapoa has been working to prevent deforestation while replanting clear cut land and creating new patches of forest. Along with the reforestation efforts, aimed at preserving the unique plant and wildlife, Itapoa's goal is to educate native settlers about the dangers of logging. By training them to use cacao as a cash crop, natives are able to bring in income as an alternative to logging or selling their land, losing it forever and forcing them to migrate out of their homes and community. We courage neighbors to allow some part of their clear cut land to have the forest grow back with the plants we produce from seeds that are collected for the project. Growing these plants is a large effort we accomplish with the help of many caring and invaluable volunteers. Some of the native plants reintroduced to these area help repopulate species of trees which are almost extinct.<p></p>
<p>Itapoa Reserve is a rainforest research and conservation project in the northwest of Ecuador. It is located in The Chocó Region which is found in Colombia and the north of Ecuador, from the Pacific coast to the Andes - one of the most beautiful areas of the world. The Tumbes-Chocó-Magdalena region counts as one of the world's 34 biodiversity hotspots. A hotspot is a region that contains more than 1500 vascular plants as endemics, and that has lost more than 70% of its primary vegetation. (An endemic species or biologic group is one that has evolved within a restricted area - a unique species that can be found only in that geographical location).In the Chocó, up to now, more than 11,000 plants, of which 2,700 are endemic, have been listed. The fauna is also particularly rich. So far 285 mammal species (11 endemic), 890 bird species (110 endemic), 327 reptile species (98 endemic), 203 amphibian species (30 endemic) and 251 freshwater fish species (115 endemic) have been identified. This is truly an area full of unique and varied plant and animal life.</p>
<p>Itapoa itself has a botanical garden with more than 400 species of flowers, tropical fruits, orchids, palms. 300 acres of rainforest in the middle of the jungle, plus a smaller piece of land where the headquarters of the project is, the gardens and 20 acres of forest as well.We protect the jungle that we have and buy more for its conservation. We tell people about the importance of the forest and its future. We create biological corridors filled with native plant species hoping it will stay this way forever.We also train and educate concerned individuals and future field biologists who come to volunteer with us from all over the world. We want everyone to feel as passionate about preserving rainforests as we do and to help in any way they can.</p>
<p>Itapoa's founder Raul Nieto also give talks in the US and Europe about the future of the Rainforest, focusing mainly in the bio diversity of the region and the destruction occurring in the last 40 years, due to a law which mandated to clear cut 50% of the forest. Since the 70s, the Chocó has been exploited by forestry companies. Tropical rainforest have an impressive number of tree species. Particularly sought after for their diverse properties, its wood is used for floorboards, sculptures, plywood, posts, resin for rubber, and nowadays tourist souvenirs.Today, the deforestation continues exterminating thousands of species of plants and the animals that lived there. Once the forest was clear cut for the wood alone. Now the forest is disappearing faster as it is being converted to a huge mono culture of African palm to produce biodiesel = NECRO DIESEL and replace fossil fuels. BIODIESEL and the idea of replacing fossil fuels with agro carburants is sentencing to death the last jungles. Because of this, only 5 % of this forest remains in Ecuador.</p>
