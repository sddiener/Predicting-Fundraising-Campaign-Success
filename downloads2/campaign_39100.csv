<p><strong></strong> </p>
<p><strong>OUR HISTORY</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever driven down the road enjoying a leisurely drive and all of a sudden had the pleasure of experiencing the aroma of, what I call, barnyard fondue?  And then looked around to see a rather productive, cattle operation and manure piled up as high as the equipment can stack it. That distinct smell fills your nostrils with an unforgettable memory. Growing up, I also gained hundreds of those types of memories; one of which involves my grandpa. As a child I had the pleasure of getting to spend quality time with my grandpa on the family ranch learning the old fashioned values of being a good steward of the land, water preservation for the crops and good old fashioned hard work. On Sundays his favorite pastime was to go to the local coffee shop with all of the other farmers and ranchers in the area. This place was amazing! I learned that you can solve all of the world's problems and fix the political system over a cup of coffee. HA, those were the days! After listening to all of the bull / Wild West tales we would head home and drive past the local cattle feed lot. Every time without a fail he would say: ""Johnny can you smell the money?""  It took 45 years of wondering what he meant by that and later, a lot of hard work but I finally figured it out.</p>
<p><strong>THE CHALLENGE</strong></p>
<p>Agricultural feeding operations are dealing with mounting piles of manure from 100 million cows that produce approx 10 billion pounds of raw product daily. Using eco-friendly composting methods we, all of us, can reuse one of the most treasured byproducts of the Ag industries: Organic fertilizer/compost. The all natural product lends itself to greater soil health, healthier plants, healthier food products, and better water holding capacities for the soil. It can also help reduce the need for man made synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. We know that the world has a lot of problems and we aren't going to solve them all. But today, right now, we have a better choice at least when it comes to foods we eat and the ground our children play on.</p>
<p><strong>VISION</strong></p>
<p>Our company Natural Nutrient Solutions has established the methodology and technology to transform this endless supply of manure into a more viable and useable product. We are proud to be leading the way to addressing the problem that the livestock and dairy producers are facing.</p>
<p><strong>THE PRODUCT</strong></p>
<p>Our product comes from natural ‘cowpies’ composted and then we shape it into ‘peas’.  You got it!  These little, organic granulates are our POOpeas.  POOpeas is a granulated earth friendly organic based fertilizer that is repurposed from livestock / dairy waste. This product is suitable for use on gardens, vegetables, herbs, flowers, trees, shrubs, roses, houseplants and  agricultural crops.</p>
<p>Our product is odorless, safe to handle by your hands, it is even safe for a child to play around and it is most certainly safe for pets and our environment. </p>

<p>So, did someone say safe fertilizer?  Did someone say sustainability?  Well, we did!  We are helping stop some of the toxins that run off into our rivers and waterways.  We don’t like risking our family or pets' health and lastly who wants to eat those chemicals?  Not us!  Our mission is to raise awareness for healthier living throughout the country by providing a safe alternative for all of us including our Mother Earth and even those cows that feed off it.  Not only do we strive to help build more sustainable gardens,farms but a healthier food chain overall so that we can all live healthier lives on this beautiful planet of ours.</p>

<p>And take a look at what John Dodson, Assistant Professor, Horticulture Technology Program at the College of Western Idaho had to say:</p>
<p>“I first became aware of Poo Peas organic soil amendment in 2010 and have used it in informal trials in varying landscape and garden plantings representing varying soil types and irrigation methods.</p>
<p>In the 36 years of my professional involvement in the Horticulture industry I have seen, used, and tested a LOT of different organic soil amendments: manures; washed manures; bedding and manure combinations; composts; and municipal sludge and wastes, to name a few. </p>
<p>One product stands out head and shoulders above the others, and that product is Poo Peas.  I have done repeated salinity ( ECe) testing from different Poo Pea bags and have found salinity levels from both short and long term saturated extracts to be ideal, in the .9 to 1.8 ECe range.  This represents ideal levels of soluble nutrients along with the longer-term organic matter content of Poo Peas.  The salinity level of an amendment is a very big deal, as the high salt levels typical of manures and certain composts have contributed to innumerable cases of root damage and plant injury and death.  The salinity level of your ‘average’ manure / compost product can range from an ECE of 6 all the way to an ECe of <strong>25</strong>.  It is general knowledge within the field of Horticulture that an <strong>ECe of higher than 5 is considered salt-toxic to the roots of most plant species.</strong> </p>
<p>An ECe between 1.0 and 2.0 is considered ideal for most plants, and Poo Peas is right in the sweet spot, between .9 and 1.8.  You could not engineer a better salinity level even using synthetic inorganic fertilizers, which of course do not provide the microbes and organic matter.</p>
<p>The terminology I am using may seem too technical or academic for some, but there is nothing academic or overly technical about losing crops and landscapes to manures and composts with toxic salt levels.  Root damage due to high salts comes on very quick, mimics drought stress, and often has done the damage before anyone realizes what has happened.</p>
<p><strong>I can without hesitation recommend Poo Peas to professionals and home gardeners alike for safe, superior results for both immediate nutrition and the long term, necessary benefits of organic soil amendments.</strong>  Additionally, the pelletized form of the product makes it very user friendly and easy to apply in accurate amounts for pre-plant soil mix’s or post-plant gardens and landscapes.</p>
<p>This is a personal not official endorsement from the College of Western Idaho. I have no ownership or affiliation with the manufacturer of Poo Peas.”</p>
<p><strong>FUNDING USES </strong></p>
<p>We seek you're help in raising these funds so that we can continue fulfilling our mission of promoting sustainability and healthy living.  We will use the raised funds to:</p>

<p>    4 Any additional funds will be used for new product line introductions.</p>
<p><strong>ONE CHOICE THE RIGHT CHOICE</strong></p>
<p>We all have a choice!  Poopeas is not just a product it’s something much bigger. Poopeas is a cause that requires people to believe in a greater purpose of the product and what it accomplishes.

The project will not be possible without your help.</span><br/><ul>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <span style=""background-color: initial;"">The garden will be home to multiple species of plants, such as columbines, sages, and honeysuckles. The plants have been estimated by a local nursery to cost about $470 in total, but because plant prices vary depending on season and availability we have decided to budget $500 for plants.

</div></div>","Who We Are, and What We Aim to Achieve This project is led by Bernice Tadique and Saumitra Kelkar, 11th grade students at Whitney High School. We aim to renovate the garden by the South Gate of the school with the help of Whitney's Key Club in order to beautify the campus, attract native species of hummingbirds and butterflies, and pay homage to Whitney High School's deceased educators. In order to carry out this project, we need to raise $1,100 in funds. The project will not be possible without your help.
   What We Need The garden will be home to multiple species of plants, such as columbines, sages, and honeysuckles. The plants have been estimated by a local nursery to cost about $470 in total, but because plant prices vary depending on season and availability we have decided to budget $500 for plants. Because the soil in the plot has been depleted of nutrients over the years, we will also be adding fifteen bags of compost, which cost $10 each, and two bags of other organic fertilizers, which cost $20 for each bag, to fortify the soil with micronutrients. We have budgeted $200 for soil amendments We also plan to mount a plaque on the back wall of the garden to commemorate Whitney High School's deceased educators. This plaque will cost about $150. We have allotted $150 more in our total budget that will be used for maintenance such as replacing dead plants, adding more fertilizer, and managing disease or pest outbreaks. If our fundraising goal is not met, we will amend our original budget plan by planting more plants from seed, choosing cheaper plant species, and planting fewer plants. We will attempt to successfully complete the garden with whatever funds we do raise. If our fundraising goal is met or exceeded, excess funds will be donated to Whitney High School's Key Club.    The Impact The garden will, aside from adding beauty to Whitney High School's campus, will be home to many butterfly and hummingbird attracting species of flowering plants, such as milkweeds, buddleias, and salvias. The garden's plants will include hosts for the caterpillars of a handful of species of butterflies, including monarch butterflies. The flowers will also attract dozens of other species of butterflies and many species of hummingbirds native to Southern California. Some of the larger shrubs in the garden will provide possible nesting sites for hummingbirds. The garden will also be very environmentally friendly to maintain. It will be watered with reclaimed water and the soil will be covered with a layer of mulch to retain water. Many of the plant species in it are natives of the Southwest. Almost all are drought tolerant. All methods of pest and disease control will be 100% environmentally friendly and all fertilizers and soil amendments will be organic. Many of these soil amendments, such as blood meal, bone meal, and coffee grounds from local coffee shops, are byproducts of other industries and would have otherwise ended up in a landfill.

<p><strong>ENGLISH TEXT BELOW</strong></p>
<p><strong>О НАС И О ГОНКЕ</strong></p>
<p>Нас зовут Петр и Олеся, мы живем и работаем в Москве. Олеся - психолог, телесно-ориентированный терапевт, работает со взрослыми людьми и подростками, рисует. Петр - тоже психолог, еще программист и художник. Но больше всего на свете мы любим путешествовать, а в этом году мы слегка сошли с ума и решили поучаствовать в Монгольском Ралли (Mongol Rally).</p>
<p>Mongol Rally - это безумная международная гонка без точного маршрута и победителей, которая проводится каждое лето и в которой люди едут через всю Европу и половину Азии на малолитражных старых автомобилях - двигатель должен быть не больше 1.0 литра и лучше, чтобы машина вообще была старой развалюхой. Так лучше ощущается дух авантюризма. На все это приключение дается два месяца и задача - вообще доехать до финиша, по статистике доезжает только 75% участников. А еще, каждая команда собирает деньги на благотворительность - и мы не исключение.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528022928/dskbhybnv2st4eahjvky.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>У нас большой опыт путешествий по самым разным странам - от Австрии, США и Италии до Индии, Непала и Мьянмы, от поездок по роскошным автобанам до автономных походов с рюкзаком за плечами по горам. Мы забирались на потухшие вулканы в Новой Зеландии, стопили машины в Грузии и катались на крышах автобусов в Непале. Петр водит мотоцикл, объехал половину Индии с рюкзаком, а Олеся проехала половину России на своей машине. В этом году мы решили объединить весь свой  опыт и попытаться добраться до Монголии на маленьком желтом Daewoo Matiz.</p>
<p>Гонка стартует 15 июля в Праге, большая часть пути проходит по Монголии, а заканчивается это все в Улан-Удэ. Мы уже вовсю готовимся к ралли, чиним машину и подготавливаем снаряжение.</p>
<p>Наша команда называется Mama Was Right (мама была права). Ну, вы понимаете, мама была права, кругом опасно.</p>

<p><strong>НА ЧТО МЫ СОБИРАЕМ ДЕНЬГИ</strong></p>
<p>Чтобы у этой гонки был общественный смысл - команды собирают деньги на благотворительные цели. Рекомендуемая организаторами сумма сбора - £1000. Мы хотим собрать с вашей помощью деньги и распределить их следующим образом:</p>
<ul>
<li>во-первых, это общественная организация Cool Earth, которая занимается сохранением лесов на планете. Это условие - часть требований организаторов Mongol Rally. Мы планируем направить в этот фонд £500 (это примерно $700)</li>
<li>во-вторых, мы хотим помочь одной московской школе, в которой учатся дети с аутизмом. Это школа имени Святого Георгия, она не получает должного финансирования от государства и большая часть затрат ложится на плечи родителей детей, которые там учатся.  Аутизм или расстройство аутистического спектра это сложное состояние, при котором человеку становится сложно коммуницировать с окружающими его людьми, снижаются способности социального взаимодействия, при этом эти люди не являются больными. Они - другие. Часто - очень талантливые в определенных сферах жизни. Но им сложно находиться в социуме и особенно сложно приходится родителям таких детей. И здесь любая финансовая помощь может очень помочь.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528023053/ev8r2yktmv6fvgd4vhyn.png"" src=""""/>

<p>(Маршрут на картинке примерный. Возможно, мы еще попробуем попасть в Туркменистан, сейчас пытаемся сделать визы.)</p>

<p><strong>ABOUT US AND RALLY</strong></p>
<p>We are two psychologists from Moscow - Petr and Olesya. Olesya is a body-oriented psychotherapist, works with children and adult people. Petr is a software developer, psychologist and a painter. We like to travel more than anything other in this life. This year we went crazy a little bit and decided to participate in Mongol Rally.</p>
<p>Mongol Rally is a crazy annual race on small dumb cars with an engine with size of 1.0L or even less. During this race people go on their old cars through Europe and Asia trying to reach wonderful Mongolia. There are no strict rules and routes in this rally - the main purpose is to reach finish line. This is an adventure. And every team raises some money for charity.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528023356/cj35cdboelrxr81avfpa.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We have a great travel experience - from USA, Austria and Italy to India, Nepal and Myanmar, from gorgeous German highways to several weeks tracks in some forests and mountains with a backpack with all equipment behind our backs. We have visited volcanos in New Zealand, hitchhiked cars in Georgia country and traveled in Nepal on bus roofs. Petr drives a motorbike and has been all around India with his backpack and Olesya has driven her car all around Russia. We decided to use all our travel experience to successfully reach Mongolia in this rally and already bought an old yellow small Daewoo Matiz with 0.8L engine. It is a very small (originally - Korean) car, nowadays it is produced in Uzbekistan. It is very popular in Moscow among pizza delivery service, because it's very simple, small and solid. </p>
<p>Official rally start is in Prague, 15th of July, the every team goes to Mongolia, finish line is in Ulan-Ude city, Russia. We've got about 2 months to complete the race.</p>
<p>Our team name is ""Mama Was Right"". You know, mama was right, the world is dangerous all around.</p>

<p><strong>ABOUT MONEY</strong></p>
<p>To make sense for this crazy rally every team raises some money for charity. Recommended amount of money is £1000. We want to raise money with all your kindly help and to spread them in that ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>first part we will give to social organisation Cool Earth, it is an official charity partner of the rally, so we are planning to give them £500 (about $700)</li>
<li>second part we want to send to one special Moscow school (Saint George School), there are children with autism studying there. Autism is a very complicated condition of<p>consciousness and mind, we don't like to call it decease, because this children are not ill, they are..different. And they have a lot of problems with communication with other people. And all their parents go through hard periods of their lives, because it is not so easy to have an autistic kid. This Moscow school doesn't receive sufficient amount of money from government so most of the spendings are on parents of these children. So, any amount of money would be very helpful for them</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>(this route is not 100% correct, we are still thinking about some parts, probably we will try to go to Turkmenistan, now we are trying to get visas there)</p>
<p>There is no such a thing as 'the route' in this rally, but our plan is:</p>
<ul>
<li>10th of July we leave Moscow and go to Prague</li>
<li>15th of July - official start in Prague</li>
<li>then we want to cross these countries - Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbia, Bulgaria and Turkey.</li>
<li>then we have two choices - enter Georgia, the enter Russia and reach Kazakhstan. Or, after Georgia we could go to Azerbaijan, take a ferry there, cross Caspian Sea  and again reach Kazakhstan. Or - take a ferry from Baku and reach Turkmenbashi city (Turkmenistan)</li>
<li>after Kazakhstan we want to go to Uzbekistan, the Tajikistan, cross Pamir Highway (4655m above the sea!!) to Kyrgyzstan, then go to north - to Kazakhstan and Russia, then finally reach Mongolia, visit Ulan-Bator and finally go north to finish line in Ulan-Ude (Russia).</li>
<li>after all of this adventure we are planning to drive back our car to Moscow</li>
</ul>

<p>Mm..anything? But this is an adventure and we are not planning to give up in any case. All the way we will make photos and videos about our trip on Instagram and Facebook</p>

О НАС И О ГОНКЕ
Нас зовут Петр и Олеся, мы живем и работаем в Москве. Олеся - психолог, телесно-ориентированный терапевт, работает со взрослыми людьми и подростками, рисует. Петр - тоже психолог, еще программист и художник. Но больше всего на свете мы любим путешествовать, а в этом году мы слегка сошли с ума и решили поучаствовать в Монгольском Ралли (Mongol Rally).
Mongol Rally - это безумная международная гонка без точного маршрута и победителей, которая проводится каждое лето и в которой люди едут через всю Европу и половину Азии на малолитражных старых автомобилях - двигатель должен быть не больше 1.0 литра и лучше, чтобы машина вообще была старой развалюхой. Так лучше ощущается дух авантюризма. На все это приключение дается два месяца и задача - вообще доехать до финиша, по статистике доезжает только 75% участников. А еще, каждая команда собирает деньги на благотворительность - и мы не исключение.

У нас большой опыт путешествий по самым разным странам - от Австрии, США и Италии до Индии, Непала и Мьянмы, от поездок по роскошным автобанам до автономных походов с рюкзаком за плечами по горам. Мы забирались на потухшие вулканы в Новой Зеландии, стопили машины в Грузии и катались на крышах автобусов в Непале. Петр водит мотоцикл, объехал половину Индии с рюкзаком, а Олеся проехала половину России на своей машине. В этом году мы решили объединить весь свой  опыт и попытаться добраться до Монголии на маленьком желтом Daewoo Matiz.
Гонка стартует 15 июля в Праге, большая часть пути проходит по Монголии, а заканчивается это все в Улан-Удэ. Мы уже вовсю готовимся к ралли, чиним машину и подготавливаем снаряжение.
Наша команда называется Mama Was Right (мама была права). Ну, вы понимаете, мама была права, кругом опасно.

НА ЧТО МЫ СОБИРАЕМ ДЕНЬГИ
Чтобы у этой гонки был общественный смысл - команды собирают деньги на благотворительные цели. Рекомендуемая организаторами сумма сбора - £1000. Мы хотим собрать с вашей помощью деньги и распределить их следующим образом:

во-первых, это общественная организация Cool Earth, которая занимается сохранением лесов на планете. Это условие - часть требований организаторов Mongol Rally. Мы планируем направить в этот фонд £500 (это примерно $700)
во-вторых, мы хотим помочь одной московской школе, в которой учатся дети с аутизмом. Это школа имени Святого Георгия, она не получает должного финансирования от государства и большая часть затрат ложится на плечи родителей детей, которые там учатся.  Аутизм или расстройство аутистического спектра это сложное состояние, при котором человеку становится сложно коммуницировать с окружающими его людьми, снижаются способности социального взаимодействия, при этом эти люди не являются больными. Они - другие. Часто - очень талантливые в определенных сферах жизни. Но им сложно находиться в социуме и особенно сложно приходится родителям таких детей. И здесь любая финансовая помощь может очень помочь.


МАРШРУТ И ДАТЫ

(Маршрут на картинке примерный. Возможно, мы еще попробуем попасть в Туркменистан, сейчас пытаемся сделать визы.)

10го июля мы стартуем из Москвы и двигаемся в Прагу
15го июля все команды старт ралли в Праге
дальше мы планируем пересечь такие страны как Чехия, Словакия, Венгрия, Хорватия, Босния и Герцеговина, Черногория, Сербия, Болгария, Турция и Грузия.
дальше у нас есть выбор - отправиться из Грузии в Россию и попасть в Казахстан. Либо, что интересней, сесть на паром в Баку (Азербайджан) и попасть в Казахстан на нем, пересечь при этом Каспийское море. Или же сесть на паром в Баку и попасть в Туркменбаши (Туркменистан)
дальше мы двигаемся в Узбекистан, Таджикистан, где мы планируем проехать Памирский тракт, Киргизию, снова попасть в Казахстан, подняться на север, пересечь границу с Россией, доехать до Монголии, посетить Улан-Батор и финишировать в Улан-Удэ, в родной России
финишировать хотим до 1го сентября, но кто знает..
из Улан-Удэ мы планируем вернуться на машине в Москву

ЧТО МОЖЕТ ПОЙТИ НЕ ТАК?
В общем, все что угодно. =) В этом то и состоит приключение! Но мы не будем унывать и будем публиковать красивые фотографии в Instagram и Facebook.

ABOUT US AND RALLY
We are two psychologists from Moscow - Petr and Olesya. Olesya is a body-oriented psychotherapist, works with children and adult people. Petr is a software developer, psychologist and a painter. We like to travel more than anything other in this life. This year we went crazy a little bit and decided to participate in Mongol Rally.
Mongol Rally is a crazy annual race on small dumb cars with an engine with size of 1.0L or even less. During this race people go on their old cars through Europe and Asia trying to reach wonderful Mongolia. There are no strict rules and routes in this rally - the main purpose is to reach finish line. This is an adventure. And every team raises some money for charity.

We have a great travel experience - from USA, Austria and Italy to India, Nepal and Myanmar, from gorgeous German highways to several weeks tracks in some forests and mountains with a backpack with all equipment behind our backs. We have visited volcanos in New Zealand, hitchhiked cars in Georgia country and traveled in Nepal on bus roofs. Petr drives a motorbike and has been all around India with his backpack and Olesya has driven her car all around Russia. We decided to use all our travel experience to successfully reach Mongolia in this rally and already bought an old yellow small Daewoo Matiz with 0.8L engine. It is a very small (originally - Korean) car, nowadays it is produced in Uzbekistan. It is very popular in Moscow among pizza delivery service, because it's very simple, small and solid. 
Official rally start is in Prague, 15th of July, the every team goes to Mongolia, finish line is in Ulan-Ude city, Russia. We've got about 2 months to complete the race.
Our team name is ""Mama Was Right"". You know, mama was right, the world is dangerous all around.


ABOUT MONEY
To make sense for this crazy rally every team raises some money for charity. Recommended amount of money is £1000. We want to raise money with all your kindly help and to spread them in that ways:

first part we will give to social organisation Cool Earth, it is an official charity partner of the rally, so we are planning to give them £500 (about $700)
second part we want to send to one special Moscow school (Saint George School), there are children with autism studying there. Autism is a very complicated condition ofconsciousness and mind, we don't like to call it decease, because this children are not ill, they are..different. And they have a lot of problems with communication with other people. And all their parents go through hard periods of their lives, because it is not so easy to have an autistic kid. This Moscow school doesn't receive sufficient amount of money from government so most of the spendings are on parents of these children. So, any amount of money would be very helpful for them



THE ROUTE AND DATES

(this route is not 100% correct, we are still thinking about some parts, probably we will try to go to Turkmenistan, now we are trying to get visas there)
There is no such a thing as 'the route' in this rally, but our plan is:

10th of July we leave Moscow and go to Prague
15th of July - official start in Prague
then we want to cross these countries - Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbia, Bulgaria and Turkey.
then we have two choices - enter Georgia, the enter Russia and reach Kazakhstan. Or, after Georgia we could go to Azerbaijan, take a ferry there, cross Caspian Sea  and again reach Kazakhstan. Or - take a ferry from Baku and reach Turkmenbashi city (Turkmenistan)
after Kazakhstan we want to go to Uzbekistan, the Tajikistan, cross Pamir Highway (4655m above the sea!!) to Kyrgyzstan, then go to north - to Kazakhstan and Russia, then finally reach Mongolia, visit Ulan-Bator and finally go north to finish line in Ulan-Ude (Russia).
after all of this adventure we are planning to drive back our car to Moscow

<p><strong>Let Us Introduce Ourselves</strong></p>
<p>We come from varied backgrounds: philosophy, fine arts, film, business, tourism, environmental governance, zoology. But now we are all Environmental Visual Communication (EVC) students and we have one goal: to change the public conversation about the environment.</p>
<p>For 7 months we meet at the Royal Ontario Museum to hone our technical savvy and creative visions. We learn how to build a bridge between you and your audience by merging arts with science. We use photography, videography, design, and social media to tell compelling stories about our natural world. We are working towards a graduate certificate from Fleming College’s School of Environmental and Natural Resource Sciences, but what we really want is change. We want to change how the public values science, and how science values storytelling.</p>
<p>We are nearing the end of our program and are about to enter the professional world. While we are confident that we have unique skills to offer, we also know that jobs in visual communication are few and far between. We believe in the power of storytelling and we want to convince professionals in the environmental field that hiring visual communicators will greatly help them to engage the public with their message.</p>
<p>This is why we are speaking at the Latornell Conservation Symposium - to help professionals understand what environmental visual communication is and why they need it and us. We won’t beat around the bush. We want jobs. That is what it comes down to. And we are campaigning to help get us there.</p>
<br/><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $3500. This will help to cover our conference registration fees, accommodations, equipment rentals, and any miscellaneous costs such as travel and printing.</p>
<p>To help us get to Latornell you can either<i> back it</i> (pink button up above) or click on the <i>perk</i> that you desire to purchase.</p>
<p>By donating, you are funding change-makers and storytellers. Besides the warm, fuzzy feeling that comes from doing something good for the world, we are also offering some great and unique perks! These include one of a kind artwork by EVC students such as drawings and hand-made polymer clay charms.</p>
<p>We are also happy to offer some amazing perks from the Royal Ontario Museum including a One Year Family Membership and a Behind-the-Scenes Experience for two people. </p>
<p>And finally, we are excited to be able to offer our skills! For an amazing price, you can get an EVC student to photograph your event. We guarantee you’ll end up with some awesome, professional quality photographs.  </p>
<p>This and more, look over all of our perks in the section below.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Humans have always connected through stories. It’s how we understand ourselves and the world around us, and how we build relationships with each other. Stories explain, communicate, teach, and at their most powerful, inspire.</p> <p>The realms of art and science are often thought of as separate disciplines, but they’re really both about conveying knowledge and meaning. Science appeals to our minds, while stories appeal to our hearts. A beautiful photo will capture attention, but what is it saying? Will it create change and generate discussion? Will it leave a lasting impression? Marketing science leverages the compelling power of storytelling by using communication methods that connect the heart and mind. The tales we read as children instilled in us values like sharing, fairness, and perseverance, and the stories we tell today can inspire us all to value nature and science for the sake of our planet.</p>
<p>Our generation has many environmental issues to tackle; from protecting watersheds, to sustainable resource management, to conserving biodiversity; and the more people that can be encouraged to support these efforts, the more effective they will be. We want professionals in the environmental sector to value storytelling, because storytelling will add value to the important things that they do, and make them matter to a greater audience. The gap that exists between science and the public needs to be addressed. The world needs science, and science needs us.</p>

<h3>Wat is Sociolution? (Dutch)</h3>
<p>Sociolution is een concept voor een (In het begin) Nederlandse stichting met het doel Sociologische problematiek concreet aanpakken. Wij willen dit doen door middel van een systeem op de toekomstige website wat constant een concrete en duidelijke uitleg gaat geven per project over wat het inhoudt, met welk doel we het opzetten en waarom we het nodig vinden.</p>
<p>Het eerste project (Wat al bekend is en een cruciale rol voor ons als stichting gaat hebben.) word het zorgen dat er een beter toezicht komt op verscheidene grote socialmedia platformen door een vorm van handhaving af te dwingen. Hiermee hopen we onder andere onnodige voorvallen van pedofiele, chantage met bijvoorbeeld naaktfoto's en mogelijke zelfmoorden te voorkomen. Dit willen we doen door er veel aandacht op te vestigen via media in combinatie met een petitie. Mocht dit niet genoeg zijn dan gaan we over op strenge juridische en politieke maatregelen.</p>

<p><i>""Sociologie is de studie van de sociale relaties tussen mensen, en in het bijzonder van de politieke, culturele, religieuze en economische aspecten van menselijke samenlevingen.

<p>Ondanks we hopen dat deze campagne ons inderdaad het beoogde bedrag oplevert is het zeker niet zo dat indien dit niet gebeurd het project niet tot realisatie komt.

<p>The
project consists of several intertwined activities:</p>
<p><b>We attended</b> the COP 19 climate talks in Warsaw where o<span>ur team of activists,
investigators, writers, and photographers documented the climate
negotiators, carbon capitalists, and global climate justice movement activists,
by interviewing whomever we could, with a special focus on youth delegates and
climate activists from the global south.  We wrote <b>blogs</b> and news analysis from Warsaw, posted<b> photos</b> and videos, and <b>filmed and interviewed</b> climate justice activists while we were there.  <br/></span></p>
<p><b>We will produce a 45-minute film</b>, <i>Not Yet the End of the World:<span> With the Global Youth Climate Justice Movement</span></i>, that focuses on the actions
and visions of the young activists of the movement for use in schools,
community settings, and in movement organizations, to be ready in the summer
of 2014.  <b>See a clip of one of the actions <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbtdXFeEUXk&amp;feature=youtu.be"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">above</a>.</b><br/></p>
<p><b>We are going to publish a</b> <b>high-quality,
beautifully illustrated and wonderfully free of cost e-book</b>, <i>At the COP:<span> Talking and Making Global Climate Justice</span></i>, to be ready in May 2014, including <span>interviews, blog posts, and other materials gathered in Warsaw.</span></p>
<p><b>We will be hosting</b> <b>a
conference</b>, <b><i>Re-Imagining Climate Justice</i></b>,
at our home institution, the University of California, Santa Barbara, in May
2014.<span>  This gathering, <b>open to everyone</b>,
is a space for envisioning ways to help 
<b>make the many struggles for climate justice stronger</b> and more creative
as they scale up their efforts to force governments and the corporations who
control them to take the measures necessary to ensure a livable planet for
future generations.  </span></p>

negotiators, exposing the maneuvers of the big corporations and their
cheerleaders, and, especially, spreading far and wide the analyses, actions,

individuals from all over the world.<br/><h4><i>What we need</i></h4>
<p>We
raised enough funding from our university to get this project off the ground by going to Warsaw to get the interviews and film footage we need for the book and the video.</p>
<p><b>What we still need to do is raise enough money to make the film and the book between now and May 2014</b>.</p>
<p><b>Your

researcher-activists</b> who have done the interviewing and filming, and are now set to transcribe
the interviews, edit the film, put the book together, and organize
the spring conference.  We can assure you

Our objective

Greetings!  We are IICAT - CJP, eight Climate Justice researchers and activists from the International Institute of Climate Action and Theory and the University of California, Santa Barbara, united in our passion to help prevent global warming from becoming a genocidal climate catastrophe. 
We are producing a film and an e-book focused on the youth side of the Global Climate Justice Movement, based on our recent participation with the movement at the UN climate negotiations that just concluded in Warsaw.

Our goal is to support the climate justice movement as it tries to shape the global climate treaty that is being negotiated for 2015.

But to do it we need your help.  We need to raise $11,000 to continue our work over the next six months and complete our film and book.“Climate
justice” can mean many things:  for us it
is meaningful action toward the most progressive possible global climate
treaty, the strongest possible social movement participation in creating that
treaty, and through both of these channels the creation of a low-carbon,
sustainable, equitable, and deeply democratic future.  We believe that if we are to inhabit a livable world in coming years, this movement must become the biggest the world has ever seen.
Our goals for the next six months are to produce, with your generous support, a book and a film documenting the global fight for climate justice, both of which we will make available to the public for free.  We have so much fantastic footage and interviews we hope to show you, and much more work to do.Our plan
The
project consists of several intertwined activities:
We attended the COP 19 climate talks in Warsaw where our team of activists,
investigators, writers, and photographers documented the climate
negotiators, carbon capitalists, and global climate justice movement activists,
by interviewing whomever we could, with a special focus on youth delegates and
climate activists from the global south.  We wrote blogs and news analysis from Warsaw, posted photos and videos, and filmed and interviewed climate justice activists while we were there.  
We will produce a 45-minute film, Not Yet the End of the World: With the Global Youth Climate Justice Movement, that focuses on the actions
and visions of the young activists of the movement for use in schools,
community settings, and in movement organizations, to be ready in the summer
of 2014.  See a clip of one of the actions above.
We are going to publish a high-quality,
beautifully illustrated and wonderfully free of cost e-book, At the COP: Talking and Making Global Climate Justice, to be ready in May 2014, including interviews, blog posts, and other materials gathered in Warsaw.
We will be hosting a
conference, Re-Imagining Climate Justice,
at our home institution, the University of California, Santa Barbara, in May
2014.  This gathering, open to everyone,
is a space for envisioning ways to help 
make the many struggles for climate justice stronger and more creative
as they scale up their efforts to force governments and the corporations who
control them to take the measures necessary to ensure a livable planet for
future generations.  


No
political process or treaty construction has ever held more universal
importance, so we think it’s crucial to get involved and let people know that
the whole world is not only watching, but participating in whatever way they
can. We hope to provide them with the support they need; by scrutinizing the small print of the
official documents, tracking the polite but deadly serious exchanges between
negotiators, exposing the maneuvers of the big corporations and their
cheerleaders, and, especially, spreading far and wide the analyses, actions,
and dreams of the youth climate justice movement, composed of organizations and
individuals from all over the world.What we need
We
raised enough funding from our university to get this project off the ground by going to Warsaw to get the interviews and film footage we need for the book and the video.
What we still need to do is raise enough money to make the film and the book between now and May 2014.
Your
contribution, however large or small, will support the work of our five young
researcher-activists who have done the interviewing and filming, and are now set to transcribe
the interviews, edit the film, put the book together, and organize
the spring conference.  We can assure you
that on a per hour basis they will be making a lot less than minimum wage, and that
is because we are all passionate about
climate justice work.





What you get
The main thing we hope you will take away from supporting our activities is a sense of having contributed something to the epic struggle for a livable planet.
In
exchange, we will share with you all the products of our work, including
eyewitness accounts from Poland, a film, an e-book, and an invitation to the
conference in the spring.
In addition, we want to thank those who contribute significantly to our work with a number of very special gifts, which you can find in the ""Perks"" section of this webpage.
Other Ways to HelpEven if you can't contribute a dime, there are some other great ways you can really help us out:
Send folks you know to our Indiegogo appeal:  igg.me/at/climate-justice-project
How to find out more
If you look at the ""Media Gallery"" link above, you'll find analysis, photos, blog posts, and footage from Warsaw and previous UN climate summits we have attended.  They will give you a real sense of the excitement, the high-stakes, and the dramas that play out in these places, far from the view of most of the world, but conducted in our names and affecting all of us.
At the Media Gallery are two trailers -- snippets of footage arranged by Richard Widick when he and John were at the Durban COP 17 in 2011, which will show you the climate justice movement in action!
You can also see a short video in which John Foran and Summer Gray's students role play the COP 19 climate summit in Sociology 134EC:  Earth in Crisis, on October 29 and 31, 2013!
Finally, you will see some of Richard's photos from the COP 17 in a PowerPoint at the Gallery.

I am part of the Climate Justice Project because I
believe we must prioritize and take action toward averting the greatest social
and environmental disaster the world has ever seen.  Climate change threatens all peoples’ quality
of life and our very existence.  It
exacerbates already existing inequalities and is fueled by unaccountable corporations
who profit from wrecking our planet.  We
must become active citizens to stop this now!  By going to the COP,
learning from activists and broadcasting their insights, concerns and
knowledge far and wide, I believe we can improve the efficacy of the global
climate justice movement to facilitate the rapid local and global actions that
are needed to secure everyone’s rights to enjoy a beautiful and healthy life on
Earth. Please support the future of our planet and society by supporting our
endeavor -- any contribution will help!  By supporting our team, many of us students, you'll help future leaders of the world start to make connections with other young climate activists, learn how to best organize against climate change and shape solutions for the future.  If you've been waiting for a new way that you can support efforts for system change (a healthier environment and society) here's your chance!

John Foran


John Foran has taught sociology at
the University of California, Santa Barbara since 1989.  His books include Fragile Resistance:  Social
Transformation in Iran from 1500 to the Present (1993, get it free here) and Taking Power:  On the Origins of Third World Revolutions
(2005).  Since attending the COP15 in
Copenhagen in 2009, he has taken constant inspiration from the global climate
justice movement, which he teaches, researches, and speaks about whenever he
can (he has been accused of talking about nothing else).  He is active in a number of
local, national, and global organizations dedicated to climate justice, and
writes for a number of on-line publications about these struggles (see his work
here and here).   I live for these kinds of projects.  There is nothing more fulfilling than trying to move the world a few inches away from the cliff we now stand over.  To be part of a movement for real social change, or to see one close up, is to live life to the full.  It's fun, energizing, hopeful, exasperating, and exhilarating -- a roller coaster that makes you laugh, cry, despair, and rejoice.  This is a movement about life, and we are going to fight for it!

Summer Gray is a Ph.D. candidate in
Sociology at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and a Research
Associate at the International Institute of Climate Action and Theory. She
is studying seawalls and climate change adaptation comparatively around the
world, and is especially interested in the Maldives, which she has written
about here and here.    I became involved with this project because I want to see the world come together to prevent a sinking ship from going down with everyone inside.  My research takes me to places that will cease to exist if carbon emissions continue to go unchecked, where entire histories will be washed into the sea for the sake of some 200 years of ""progress.""  This is not a time for helplessness and despair.  It is not a time to leave it to the politicians and economists to find a solution to the crisis.  If we are to avoid a future defined by the phrase ""too little, too late,"" then this is a time to come together and do everything humanly possible to turn the tide.

Through sharing kernels of insight on the
movement, the situation we face, and the work that lies ahead from the
perspective of people invested in creating a climate future that is livable for
all on this planet, it is my hope that we can create new ways of understanding
and working against the climate reality we are now confronted with.  It is the time to
envision a ""future otherwise"";  I believe we can grow the seed of hope in alternative futures into a
force strong enough to reinvigorate those already involved in climate justice
work, inspire more to join in the fight that is for all of our futures, and start provocative conversations within the movement on how to better pursue
the system wide changes we seek.  I do
this work because we ought to have a better future than the one global power
structures currently have planned for us. It is of utmost importance that the voices of young people around the world be heard in the process of shaping the climate future they will inherit.  Please support our team in pursuing this
work!

The issue of climate change is related to every other challenge that we face as a global community, from immigration conflicts to economic decline, and it requires a global response.  After years of studying the international climate negotiations, I believe that a successful global response won't come from the UN decision makers -- rather, it will come from community organizers around the world who are mobilizing to address these challenges in a variety of creative ways.  These are the stories that I hope to tell and learn from my research at the COP 19.  The COP provides an important nexus where the global climate justice movement can come together to build momentum.  By supporting our project, you are allowing us to document this movement, contribute to it, and bring the world one step closer to climate justice now!

on theory, culture, media, globalization, social movements and environment
before coming to the Orfalea Center.  He
is the author of Trouble in the Forest: California's Redwood Timber
Wars (University of Minnesota Press, 2009), an ethnography, cultural

industrialization of California's northern redwood region—a history of the
Indian wars and labor trouble that set the legal, social and ecological
conditions for converging peoples, labor and environmental movements in the
present era of globalization. In new research aimed at further integrating
global studies and cultural sociology with media and environmental theory,
Widick scales up his institutional analysis of US culture to the international
scene of western modernity and the UN climate negotiations. In preparation of a
new manuscript Climate of Empire, he
is conducting fieldwork with collaborator John Foran at the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change Conferences of Parties to the
negotiations (COPs), first at COP 17 in Durban, South Africa 2011 and COP18 in
Doha, Qatar 2012, and presently at COP 19 in Warsaw.  Looking forward, his research program
includes ethnographic participation at COPs 20 in Lima, Peru 2014 and COP 21 in
Paris, France 2015, at which latter event the UN’s new climate treaty governing
the post-2020 global response to climate change
will be adopted.  Widick and Foran are

Climate change is the largest, most threatening, and possibly most elusive threat facing humanity.  It is the largest because it affects all living beings, no matter where they live, who they are, or what they do.  It is the most threatening as it can destroy economies, rob people of their livelihoods and their very existence, and cause massive environmental devastation.  And it is the most elusive since it is not nearly as visible as war or apartheid.  Yet there are those who are actively fighting climate change, and again, those who actively fight them.  


I am excited to attend COP 19 because it's the place where all of this comes together.  I hope to see for myself what it all means and to share the stories of those who have had their voices muted.  I strongly believe that meaningful action must be taken on the international level, yet there is something that consistently blocks such action.  I hope that my background in science and my current work in activism will me help piece together the pieces of this complicated puzzle and share with you the youth story.  I sincerely hope you consider donating to help us make this a reality.  With it, we will be able to better dissect the information we gather while at COP 19 and share it with our communities, including the larger earth community.  That's you!

<h3>Bref résumé </h3>
<p>Le Pays Dogon est un milieu exceptionnel, site du Patrimoine Mondiale de l'UNESCO. Le comité GriDaya (agriculture) du Centre Indigo, situé dans la commune de Dourou sur le Plateau Dogon a une antenne à Québec avec Erica Pomerance et un groupe de soutien composé de gens qui ont déja visité cette région unique.  La commune de Dourou comprend une 30e de villages avec une population d'environ 20 000 habitants qui beneficieront eventuellement de ce projet. La création de vergers fruitiers et de jardins maraichers bio nous permettra de diversifier les pratiques agricoles dans le Cercle de Bandiagara. Nous allons également cultiver la plante indigo utilisée par les teinturières de la région.  Le Mali entier a été durement frappé par le coup d'etat de 2011 et l'occupation du Nord, et maintenant du Centre, par des groupes terroristes. La chute du tourisme et l'insecurité générale sont couplées à la saturation du marché de l'échalotte francaise, qui constitue le principal produit agricole commercial chez les Dogons. Nous voulons diversifer nos pratiques agricoles traditionnelles, tout en créant de nouvelles sources de revenu.  Nos 4 vergers seront plantés sur des terres arables d'un hectare chacun avec accès facile à la nappe fréatique de surface. La production locale de fruits et légumes répondra aux besoins alimentaires de la population, notamment les femmes et enfants, tout en palliant à l’absence de fruits sur les marchés régionnaux des villages Dogon. La plantation de divers espèces d’arbres fruitiers et des espèces naturelles (dattier, raisinier, tamarindier, baobab) aidera à lutter contre les effets du changement climatique. Ce projet créera des emplois pour de nombreux jeunes et contribuera à freiner l'exode rurale. Les femmes seront impliquées directement dans la plantation d'indigo, et la récolte et la mise en marché des fruits des vergers.</p>

Une portion de l'argent recueilli servira à former et défrayer la main d'oeuvre locale pour creuser les puits, clôturer des 4 hectares, la plantation, l'arrosage, l'essherbage et l'entretien des arbres.</p>

</div></div>","Help us help the hundreds of community activists out there tell the 
story of the oil era and the dawn of a ""new normal"" through a powerful presentation and training.
This is Who We Are.

Founded in 2003, Post Carbon Institute is leading the transition to a more resilient, equitable, and sustainable world. We envision a world of resilient communities and re-localized economies that thrive within ecological bounds. 

This is What We Want To Do.

In the last year, a lot of our supporters have asked us to create a presentation for friends, neighbors and local groups that shows how we can move through and beyond the  interrelated economic, energy, environmental, and equity crises we face. Show us the problems. Show us what to do. Show us how to prosper. Check, check and check. 

But just any presentation won't do. 

We will craft an immersive, customizable experience that has the power to convince, not alienate; to propel toward immediate action, not just foster endless discussion.

As you know, great ideas cost, you know, money. 
We're rich in the former, not so much in the latter.

And so, this effort to raise funds and find people who will help us deliver the presentation around the world.


The Impact of Your Support.

We're out to save the world. This is straight talk, no hyperbole.

Beyond the environment, there are numerous interwoven issues that we have to deal with... and there is no magic bullet that will save us. We have hard work to do. And a hell of a lot of it.

<h3>Join 'Dan the Nature Man'...</h3> <p>Dan Schneider (more affectionately known as 'Dan, Dan The Nature Man') has been a familiar face at the Guelph Lake Nature Centre for more than 30 years, helping young and old develop an appreciation for our natural world.</p>
<blockquote>
<i>“We would pull up along the wooden fence in front of the centre and there would be Dan, waving and smiling at us, as if we were being welcomed home. The days with Dan were the best part of school for me.”</i>  
</blockquote>
<blockquote>- Rachel Greene, Former Guelph Lake Nature Centre Student</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Like Rachel, Guelph Lake Nature Centre holds a special place in the hearts of many children and adults in our community. Visiting students readily recall their hike to the hugging tree, sitting silently with the chickadees, or wading in the river looking for critters; a day at Guelph Lake has always been something special.</p>
<p>This past spring, Dan made a tough decision, setting sight on his next adventure -- retirement!... but there was a catch. Just as in nature, Dan wanted to leave the Nature Centre just a little better than he found it.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>The current Guelph Lake Nature Centre has been around as long as Dan has, and seen more than 600,000 students during that time. A former residential bungalow, the nature centre is ready for its retirement party as well and Dan, with your help, wants to give it a proper send-off...</p>
<p><b>Your support in this campaign will help us create a dedicated natural learning space at the new Guelph Lake Nature Centre Complex where students and visitors can learn and explore in an area that is very special to Dan.</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h3>The New Guelph Lake Nature Centre Complex</h3>
</div><div> <p>After more than 30 years of operation and more than 600,000 visitors, it’s time to look ahead to something new. To support coming generations of outdoor learners, GRCA and the Grand River Conservation Foundation are in the process of raising funds for a brand new Guelph Lake Nature Centre. With our community’s help, the new facility will support more students in nature, connect with more visitors to Guelph Lake, and create a lifetime of memories for those who pass through its doors.<br/></p>
<p></p>

<br/><p>When all is said and done, the new Guelph Lake Nature Centre will be an incredible 8,000 square foot space, purpose-built with one primary focus -- to get visitors as closely connected to nature as possible. We're one-third of the way to our goal of $3-million dollars. Construction is expected to begin in June 2016, once 75% of the funds have been raised toward the new facility.<br/></p>

The GRCA has been providing an escape to students and visitors to our nature centres for more than thirty years. Each visit to one of our facilities helps kids develop a deeper connection to the natural world that surrounds them.</div>
<div>The Grand River Conservation Authority operates 5 full-time outdoor education centres in the Grand River watershed (Southern Ontario). At Guelph Lake Nature Centre, students from the Wellington Catholic District School Board visit the centre at least once per year from Grade 1 to Grade 8 and many choose to come back and participate in specialized high school programming as well.</div>

<h4>How can YOU help?</h4>
<p>In any significant project, many hands make light work. Creating a new Guelph Lake Nature Centre Complex is no different. A donation to the Join Dan campaign provides you with access to some incredibly unique, one-of-a-kind perks. How cool would it be to bring your ENTIRE school out for a movie night on the island at Guelph Lake?</p>
<p>If helping financially isn't an option for you, we'd really appreciate you taking the time to share this project with your friends, family, and neighbours. Each person you tell about the new Guelph Lake Nature Centre Complex gets us one step closer to creating a new, and very special place on the shores of Guelph Lake.</p>

</div></div>","Join 'Dan the Nature Man'... Dan Schneider (more affectionately known as 'Dan, Dan The Nature Man') has been a familiar face at the Guelph Lake Nature Centre for more than 30 years, helping young and old develop an appreciation for our natural world.

“We would pull up along the wooden fence in front of the centre and there would be Dan, waving and smiling at us, as if we were being welcomed home. The days with Dan were the best part of school for me.”  

- Rachel Greene, Former Guelph Lake Nature Centre Student

Like Rachel, Guelph Lake Nature Centre holds a special place in the hearts of many children and adults in our community. Visiting students readily recall their hike to the hugging tree, sitting silently with the chickadees, or wading in the river looking for critters; a day at Guelph Lake has always been something special.
This past spring, Dan made a tough decision, setting sight on his next adventure -- retirement!... but there was a catch. Just as in nature, Dan wanted to leave the Nature Centre just a little better than he found it.

The current Guelph Lake Nature Centre has been around as long as Dan has, and seen more than 600,000 students during that time. A former residential bungalow, the nature centre is ready for its retirement party as well and Dan, with your help, wants to give it a proper send-off...
Your support in this campaign will help us create a dedicated natural learning space at the new Guelph Lake Nature Centre Complex where students and visitors can learn and explore in an area that is very special to Dan.

The New Guelph Lake Nature Centre Complex
 After more than 30 years of operation and more than 600,000 visitors, it’s time to look ahead to something new. To support coming generations of outdoor learners, GRCA and the Grand River Conservation Foundation are in the process of raising funds for a brand new Guelph Lake Nature Centre. With our community’s help, the new facility will support more students in nature, connect with more visitors to Guelph Lake, and create a lifetime of memories for those who pass through its doors.


When all is said and done, the new Guelph Lake Nature Centre will be an incredible 8,000 square foot space, purpose-built with one primary focus -- to get visitors as closely connected to nature as possible. We're one-third of the way to our goal of $3-million dollars. Construction is expected to begin in June 2016, once 75% of the funds have been raised toward the new facility.

<h3>I'm Alana Lea and you helped me raise funds to plant the first 1,000 trees for a reforestation project I started in Brazil in 2009.</h3>
<p>Since then, I've been able to give <strong>nearly 5,000 trees</strong> back to the rainforest where I was born. I couldn't have done it without the help of friends like you. Please, meet some of them on the Gallery page here. You can watch the amazing <strong>Kids for Environmental and Social Action</strong> benefit concert video, the <strong>Agape International Choir</strong> singing a special rainforest blessing song, comedians <strong>Abby Lodmer</strong> and  <strong>Swami Beyondananda</strong> talkin' trees, and the <strong>LovEarth TV</strong> producer all inviting you to join us!</p>

<p>Rio+20 commemorates the 20th anniversary of the historic <strong>United Nations Conference on Environment and Development</strong> (UNCED), also known as the <strong>Rio Summit</strong> or <strong>Earth Summit</strong>  of 1992.

<p>Perhaps you've seen the video of <strong>Severn Cullis Suzuki</strong>, who delivered the most memorable speech of the event. She was 12 years old at the time. Whether or not you've seen it before, please, watch it now to remember why this matters so much. Just click on the Gallery above to find it. She will explain eloquently why it's so important to <strong>show up</strong>, to <strong>speak up</strong> and to <strong>act now</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>20 years later, we have not made much progress.</strong> To the contrary, seem to have slid backward in far too many areas. One of the reasons I feel so strongly to go, is to support the Brazilian movement that is trying hard to uphold a decent forest code that is now in danger of changes to favor big Agriculture's demands, backed by US corporations. I know the heartache of the Brazilian people who suffer from horrific flooding due to deforestation, as well as that of the small growers working so hard to meet the country's reforestation goals that are now in jeopardy.</p>
<p>I intend to do interviews with attendees - not the big organizational talking heads - but the grassroots activists who are coming from around the world, seeking greater <strong>cooperation in action on our climate change goals</strong>. I am determined to find and to record, hope. Whatever I record there will go into the next video book.</p>
<h3>During this trip back to Brazil I'll also be able to visit the sites where our 5,000 trees have been planted.</h3>
<p>I've received reports and photos from the small, local ngo we give them to, but it will be wonderful to see and feel and report on the growth in person!<strong> We have a request to raise funds to plant 250 acres</strong>, so I intend to visit the planting sites as well, to show you where tree gifts will be given next.</p>

<h3>Here's what you need to know about Battery Urban Farm, and why we need your help:</h3>
<p>First, watch the video above, and see why we are more fun than recess.<strong> </strong><a href=""http://www.thebattery.org/projects/battery-urban-farm/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Battery Urban Farm</a> is a one-acre educational community farm located in The Battery, one of New York City’s most famous and beloved parks. <strong>We teach children how to grow and eat healthy food, and provide a thriving public farm to the 6 million visitors, residents, and commuters who pass through our park every year.</strong></p>
<p>Battery Urban Farm Staff teach free and suggested-donation classes to thousands of students from all over New York City. In order to keep our programs running, we need support from <strong>YOU</strong> – our community, our city, and anyone who believes in the power of knowing where our food comes from.</p>
<p>Support from our community became even more crucial last fall when Superstorm Sandy hit -<strong> our offices were completely destroyed, our farm flooded</strong>.   </p>
<p><img alt=""TBC offices flooded after SuperStorm Sandy"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8259/8652560852_af47cd9445_n_d.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8260/8652562500_efe2088970_n_d.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8386/8652571052_5f10842117_n_d.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We have worked hard through the winter to rebuild and recover, but now we need some help. We are calling on all of you to <strong>support Battery Urban Farm</strong> and help <strong>keep us growing veggies and growing farmers. </strong>Here's how far we've already come:</p>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8261/8651670791_a370e62878_n_d.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Radish Farmers""/></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In our first year, 2011, we taught 870 students from 11 different schools </strong></li>
<li><strong>In 2012, those numbers doubled: 1,800 students from 30 schools visited, learned, and tasted from the farm</strong></li>
<li><strong>It’s early in 2013, and already we have requests for 1,500 students from 23 schools to come learn with us</strong></li>
</ul><p>WHAT WILL OUR NUMBERS BE IN 2013? This is up to you.</p>
<p><strong>Support Battery Urban Farm and you ensure that we can say YES to every child and every request that comes our way.</strong></p>
<p>As you can see from the numbers above, we receive a lot of requests, in part because we are fortunate enough to have our farm located in one of the most heavily trafficked areas in NYC, with <strong>6 million visitors annually</strong> from across the globe. With your help in 2013, we will continue to thrive and show the world what’s possible when you combine an acre of land, an inspired community, and a whole lot of hard work.</p>
<p>The Battery Conservancy and Battery Urban Farm rely on the support from our generous donors to keep our programs running, and that need has grown even more since Superstorm Sandy. <strong>Help Battery Urban Farm meet our goal of $15,000 and 200 gifts in the next 40 days.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>THE STORY of BATTERY URBAN FARM</strong></h2>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8405/8651466659_96a5ac9600_d.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""BUF""/></p>
<p>The Battery Conservancy was created in 1994 to rebuild and revitalize The Battery and Castle Clinton National Monument. The Battery remains one of the oldest public open spaces in continuous use in New York City. The Conservancy honors and preserves this heritage by rebuilding the park’s landscape to interpret its past. The new landscape also celebrates the natural environment while meeting the needs of a growing residential population, crowds of bustling commuters and workers, and the millions of visitors who come from all over the world to see the Statue of Liberty, the magnificent harbor, and New York’s many cultural destinations.</p>
<p><br/><strong>In 2011, The Battery Conservancy received an intriguing request: Eight students from a local high school wanted to grow vegetables in the park. </strong>The Battery Conservancy saw an oppurtunity to take advantage of our highly visible location by building an interactive, productive and educational farm that had the potential to create real change in our community. So instead of saying <strong>YES</strong> to just eight students, <strong>we called every school in Lower Manhattan and invited them to come join us in building a farm right in the Financial District.</strong></p>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8265/8651868991_14d2471f2b_m_d.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""March""/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8113/8652569188_af4e8e9b26_m_d.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""April""/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8258/8651483255_5939e4324c_m_d.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""June""/></strong></p>
<p>Though we only intended to run the farm for one year, the tremendous support from our community convinced us that the farm had to stay. Two years later, <strong>we have educated </strong><strong><em>thousands</em></strong><strong> of children and adults. </strong></p>

<h3><strong>Growing Food</strong></h3>
<p>Though our main focus at Battery Urban Farm is education, one way in which we are different from many other educational farms is that <strong>we </strong><strong>are a highly productive growing space. </strong><strong> </strong>Battery Urban Farm focuses on growing for production and education, because we want the public to see how much food can be grown on just an acre of land. We also feel it is important that our students' farm work is modeled on real production-oriented farming practices, in order to teach them the value of <strong>hard work, patience, and cooperation.</strong></p>
<p>The thousands of pounds of veggies, herbs and flowers we grow each year have three main destinations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>School Cafeterias:</strong> First and foremost, produce is donated to our school cafeterias through the <a href=""http://growtolearn.org/view/DP5619"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Garden to School Café Program</a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Farm Share: </strong>Members of our community join our summer farm share (like a CSA!) and receive a bounty of fresh seasonal vegetables, herbs and flowers when school is not in session.</li>
<li>
<strong>Restaurants and Soup Kitchens: </strong>These receive all excess produce that our schools or CSA members do not need/want, to ensure that no food ever goes to waste.</li>

<h2>WHY WE DO WHAT WE DO</h2>
<p>Too many children have little or no idea how the food choices they make every day (including how the food was grown, processed, transported and prepared) affect both their health and that of our environment. Largely as a result of this disconnect, rising obesity rates among our nation’s youth have hit alarming levels. In New York City, many families are without access to fresh fruit or vegetables, as they live in “food deserts” where there are no grocery stores or farmers markets, only delis and bodegas which sell mostly highly processed foods.</p>
<p>In the two years since we opened, Battery Urban Farm Staff have noticed that many of our students do not understand that most of what they eat comes from a plant that was once growing on a farm. <strong>Battery Urban Farm works to help students find the connection between farming and eating, so they understand that without farms, there would be no food.</strong> We often have students guess that their pizza came from a “pizza factory,” as they do not realize that the cheese, tomatoes and flour they are eating all came from farms. They often remark that mint tastes like gum, and are surprised and delighted that the popcorn we grow on the farm could be microwaved just like the popcorn they eat at home in front of the TV.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8241/8651469435_8176465a2a_d.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Seeds""/><br/><br/></p>
<h3><strong>Change that Parents and Teachers Can See</strong></h3>
<p>Children are notoriously finicky eaters, frequently refusing to even try new foods. And yet come harvest time, all it takes is a few weeks of tending a row of sweet little turnips and one brave, enthusiastic classmate to encourage thirty first-graders to go from “yuck!” to “Can I have seconds?” We’ve witnessed it firsthand. Ask anyone involved in gardening with kids, and they’ll tell you what we see at Battery Urban Farm almost every day: that if kids grow it, <strong>they’re more willing to eat it.</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">“<em>Olivia LOVED the gardening class. She NEVER eats veggies, but she was actually munching on Swiss Chard at the farm!!  The day she brought home the tomatoes and cucumbers, she was so excited and called me at work to ask me to buy lettuce, carrots and celery so that she could chop up what she had brought home and make a salad.</em>”</p>

<p>And that's just the beginning. Battery Urban Farm is encouraging students to learn not just on the farm, but beyond. Children in New York City are not only often without access to fresh fruits and vegetables, but they rarely have the opportunity to <strong>explore the natural world</strong>. Many of our students have recess in their cafeterias, and some of them have never seen worms before. By giving students the opportunity to engage with flowers, plants and insects, we allow them to exercise the natural curiosity that every child enjoys.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">“<em>Nadia has been watering the trees in the playgrounds [since joining the City Seedlings summer program] - she fills up her bucket with water from the sprinklers</em>!”</p>

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">“<em>It was a rewarding </em><em>experience when [after weeding chickweed during a farm lesson] we were on another field trip at a solar estuary and some of the kids started weeding – my group of students discovered a gardener pulling chickweed and insisted on doing it for him!</em>”</p>

<p>Additionally, teachers often share stories of how students that may not excel in a classroom setting shine on the farm. Other teachers report that <strong>students are more responsible and respectful with their classmates</strong> during and after farm visits. </p>
<p>“<em>The experience of bringing students to the farm has been invaluable. There is something very powerful working in the space- as I have observed students collaborating and sharing in ways in which they haven’t in the classroom</em>.”</p>

<h3><strong>Giving Kids the Tools</strong></h3>
<p>The skills and concepts students learn on the farm are not limited to the farm sphere. <strong>Battery Urban Farm is an outdoor classroom that reinforces and enlivens concepts learned in school with farm-based projects, exercises and vocabulary that bloom into a broader, interconnected web of knowledge.</strong> Our lessons incorporate Math, Science, Art, History and English, so that the experiential education on the farm is interdisciplinary. In order to ensure that our curriculum is reinforcing concepts from the classroom, we make sure all our lessons correspond to NY State CORE curriculum standards.</p>
<p>For example: Lessons on food miles encourage kids to think about what their breakfast is made of, calculate how far it traveled, and how much energy it took to fuel that trip based on the method of transport. An introduction to the history of The Battery and traditional Dutch and Lenape farming methods encourages students to think about the history of the land and the many cultures who have farmed here before us.</p>

<p>Camilla has always been fascinated by the natural world. When she moved to the urban jungle to earn her B.A. in Environmental Philosophy and Food Ethics at NYU, she realized that her inner country girl could not be ignored. She learned how to grow vegetables by travelling through India and Europe working on a variety of small organic farms, which taught her the importance of developing your own farming method in response to your land and your community. Just prior to joining Battery Urban Farm, Camilla spent a season learning about biodynamics as an apprentice at Live Power Community Farm in Covelo, California. As the Project Manager of Battery Urban Farm, Camilla is grateful to have a job that rarely feels like work.</p>

<p><strong>Lauren Kaplan, Project Coordinator</strong><br/> Lauren grew up on the North Fork of Long Island, where she developed an early and deep-seated appreciation for the value that small-scale farms and access to locally grown food bring to a community. After a six-year career in book publishing, Lauren felt the pull of her rural roots and made the decision to support diversified, sustainable and local agriculture with more than just her fork. She worked or volunteered with Red Jacket Orchards, Garden of Eve, GrowNYC, two East End wineries and a flower shop before joining The Battery Conservancy as Project Coordinator of Battery Urban Farm. Together with her Battery Urban Farm team, she cultivates young farmers, conscientious eaters, garden advocates – and vegetables, of course – from the ground up. </p>

<p>As a high school student, Anna started her love of urban farming at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. There, she learned how to produce a variety of vegetables from small plot of land and teach others the joy of growing their own food - something she hasn't stopped doing since. Before becoming the Farm Educator at The Battery Conservancy, she lived on Martha’s Vineyard managing the education garden at the Farm Institute. Anna graduated from Beloit College with a B.S. in Environmental Biology and a minor in Studio Art. She is delighted to return to her New York City roots and encourage other “city kids” to go ahead and get their hands dirty.</p>

-- Battery Urban Student Farmer, 3rd Grade

Here's what you need to know about Battery Urban Farm, and why we need your help:
First, watch the video above, and see why we are more fun than recess. Battery Urban Farm is a one-acre educational community farm located in The Battery, one of New York City’s most famous and beloved parks. We teach children how to grow and eat healthy food, and provide a thriving public farm to the 6 million visitors, residents, and commuters who pass through our park every year.
Battery Urban Farm Staff teach free and suggested-donation classes to thousands of students from all over New York City. In order to keep our programs running, we need support from YOU – our community, our city, and anyone who believes in the power of knowing where our food comes from.
Support from our community became even more crucial last fall when Superstorm Sandy hit - our offices were completely destroyed, our farm flooded.   

We have worked hard through the winter to rebuild and recover, but now we need some help. We are calling on all of you to support Battery Urban Farm and help keep us growing veggies and growing farmers. Here's how far we've already come:


In our first year, 2011, we taught 870 students from 11 different schools 
In 2012, those numbers doubled: 1,800 students from 30 schools visited, learned, and tasted from the farm
It’s early in 2013, and already we have requests for 1,500 students from 23 schools to come learn with us
WHAT WILL OUR NUMBERS BE IN 2013? This is up to you.
Support Battery Urban Farm and you ensure that we can say YES to every child and every request that comes our way.
As you can see from the numbers above, we receive a lot of requests, in part because we are fortunate enough to have our farm located in one of the most heavily trafficked areas in NYC, with 6 million visitors annually from across the globe. With your help in 2013, we will continue to thrive and show the world what’s possible when you combine an acre of land, an inspired community, and a whole lot of hard work.
The Battery Conservancy and Battery Urban Farm rely on the support from our generous donors to keep our programs running, and that need has grown even more since Superstorm Sandy. Help Battery Urban Farm meet our goal of $15,000 and 200 gifts in the next 40 days.

What your donation does:

Ensures the continuation of our program despite the tremendous damage to our organization during Superstorm Sandy;
Helps us continue to offer all our programs for free or a small suggested donation;
Supports the salaries of the four dedicated staff members who made the dream of Battery Urban Farm a reality.
The kinds of things your donation will pay for:


$25: New worms for our vermicompost system that was flooded in Superstorm Sandy
$50: Pantry items for making salads and smoothies on the farm
$100: A children’s bike to use with our bike blender for on-farm food prep
$500: A Farm Share for a local family unable to afford a donation
$1000: A year long share of vegetables for a school cafeteria that cannot afford a donation

Can’t donate? Here’s how else you can help!

THE STORY of BATTERY URBAN FARM

The Battery Conservancy was created in 1994 to rebuild and revitalize The Battery and Castle Clinton National Monument. The Battery remains one of the oldest public open spaces in continuous use in New York City. The Conservancy honors and preserves this heritage by rebuilding the park’s landscape to interpret its past. The new landscape also celebrates the natural environment while meeting the needs of a growing residential population, crowds of bustling commuters and workers, and the millions of visitors who come from all over the world to see the Statue of Liberty, the magnificent harbor, and New York’s many cultural destinations.
In 2011, The Battery Conservancy received an intriguing request: Eight students from a local high school wanted to grow vegetables in the park. The Battery Conservancy saw an oppurtunity to take advantage of our highly visible location by building an interactive, productive and educational farm that had the potential to create real change in our community. So instead of saying YES to just eight students, we called every school in Lower Manhattan and invited them to come join us in building a farm right in the Financial District.

Though we only intended to run the farm for one year, the tremendous support from our community convinced us that the farm had to stay. Two years later, we have educated thousands of children and adults.

Though our main focus at Battery Urban Farm is education, one way in which we are different from many other educational farms is that we are a highly productive growing space.  Battery Urban Farm focuses on growing for production and education, because we want the public to see how much food can be grown on just an acre of land. We also feel it is important that our students' farm work is modeled on real production-oriented farming practices, in order to teach them the value of hard work, patience, and cooperation.
The thousands of pounds of veggies, herbs and flowers we grow each year have three main destinations:


School Cafeterias: First and foremost, produce is donated to our school cafeterias through the Garden to School Café Program


Farm Share: Members of our community join our summer farm share (like a CSA!) and receive a bounty of fresh seasonal vegetables, herbs and flowers when school is not in session.

Restaurants and Soup Kitchens: These receive all excess produce that our schools or CSA members do not need/want, to ensure that no food ever goes to waste.

Ask anyone involved in gardening with kids, and they’ll tell you what we see at Battery Urban Farm almost every day: that if kids grow it, they’re more willing to eat it.
“Olivia LOVED the gardening class. She NEVER eats veggies, but she was actually munching on Swiss Chard at the farm!!  The day she brought home the tomatoes and cucumbers, she was so excited and called me at work to ask me to buy lettuce, carrots and celery so that she could chop up what she had brought home and make a salad.”
-- Battery Urban Farm Parent
 
 
And that's just the beginning. Battery Urban Farm is encouraging students to learn not just on the farm, but beyond. Children in New York City are not only often without access to fresh fruits and vegetables, but they rarely have the opportunity to explore the natural world. Many of our students have recess in their cafeterias, and some of them have never seen worms before. By giving students the opportunity to engage with flowers, plants and insects, we allow them to exercise the natural curiosity that every child enjoys.
“Nadia has been watering the trees in the playgrounds [since joining the City Seedlings summer program] - she fills up her bucket with water from the sprinklers!”
-- Battery Urban Farm Parent                                                                       
“It was a rewarding experience when [after weeding chickweed during a farm lesson] we were on another field trip at a solar estuary and some of the kids started weeding – my group of students discovered a gardener pulling chickweed and insisted on doing it for him!”
-- First Grade Teacher
 

Additionally, teachers often share stories of how students that may not excel in a classroom setting shine on the farm. Other teachers report that students are more responsible and respectful with their classmates during and after farm visits. 
“The experience of bringing students to the farm has been invaluable. There is something very powerful working in the space- as I have observed students collaborating and sharing in ways in which they haven’t in the classroom.”
-- Therapy on the Farm, Teacher

Giving Kids the Tools
The skills and concepts students learn on the farm are not limited to the farm sphere. Battery Urban Farm is an outdoor classroom that reinforces and enlivens concepts learned in school with farm-based projects, exercises and vocabulary that bloom into a broader, interconnected web of knowledge. Our lessons incorporate Math, Science, Art, History and English, so that the experiential education on the farm is interdisciplinary. In order to ensure that our curriculum is reinforcing concepts from the classroom, we make sure all our lessons correspond to NY State CORE curriculum standards.
For example: Lessons on food miles encourage kids to think about what their breakfast is made of, calculate how far it traveled, and how much energy it took to fuel that trip based on the method of transport. An introduction to the history of The Battery and traditional Dutch and Lenape farming methods encourages students to think about the history of the land and the many cultures who have farmed here before us.

 
At Battery Urban Farm, Kids are changing what they eat, how they treat plants, and how they treat each other.
 
Studies Show
Here are some people who agree with us about the importance of bringing our students outside and into the garden:

California Board of Education: A Healthy Nutrition Environment: Linking Education, Activity, and Food through School Gardens

National Science Teachers Association: School Gardens Grow Science Achievement Scores

Harvard Education Letter: Taking the Common Core Outside: School gardens offer lessons beyond science and healthy eating

School Nutrition Association: School Gardens as a Strategy for Increasing Fruit and Vegetable Consumption

The Team: Who We Are

Camilla Hammer, Project Manager
Camilla has always been fascinated by the natural world. When she moved to the urban jungle to earn her B.A. in Environmental Philosophy and Food Ethics at NYU, she realized that her inner country girl could not be ignored. She learned how to grow vegetables by travelling through India and Europe working on a variety of small organic farms, which taught her the importance of developing your own farming method in response to your land and your community. Just prior to joining Battery Urban Farm, Camilla spent a season learning about biodynamics as an apprentice at Live Power Community Farm in Covelo, California. As the Project Manager of Battery Urban Farm, Camilla is grateful to have a job that rarely feels like work.
 
Lauren Kaplan, Project Coordinator Lauren grew up on the North Fork of Long Island, where she developed an early and deep-seated appreciation for the value that small-scale farms and access to locally grown food bring to a community. After a six-year career in book publishing, Lauren felt the pull of her rural roots and made the decision to support diversified, sustainable and local agriculture with more than just her fork. She worked or volunteered with Red Jacket Orchards, Garden of Eve, GrowNYC, two East End wineries and a flower shop before joining The Battery Conservancy as Project Coordinator of Battery Urban Farm. Together with her Battery Urban Farm team, she cultivates young farmers, conscientious eaters, garden advocates – and vegetables, of course – from the ground up. 
 
Anna Scott Ellis, Farm Educator
As a high school student, Anna started her love of urban farming at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. There, she learned how to produce a variety of vegetables from small plot of land and teach others the joy of growing their own food - something she hasn't stopped doing since. Before becoming the Farm Educator at The Battery Conservancy, she lived on Martha’s Vineyard managing the education garden at the Farm Institute. Anna graduated from Beloit College with a B.S. in Environmental Biology and a minor in Studio Art. She is delighted to return to her New York City roots and encourage other “city kids” to go ahead and get their hands dirty.

Henry Sweets, Farm Foreman
Henry has a B.A. in Philosophy from the University of the South and has worked for the Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture in Pocantico Hills, NY, and Greenacres Farm in Cincinnati, OH. Henry spends most of his time out on the farm tending to plants or building and maintaining farm infrastructure. He will be growing several varieties of his favorite vegetable, Okra, because he still can't decide which one he loves most.

<p>Small communities in the region of La Mixteca Alta, in Southern Mexico, live largely as subsistence farmers. However,<strong><em> soil erosion and insufficient water make agricultural practices extremely difficult.</em></strong> This has led to a dwindling population as people emigrate to regions with more resources. Local communities have taken many steps in an attempt to restore the natural original landscape of the region.<br/><br/> While community driven projects like reforestation, rainwater catchment systems, composting and soil fertilization have helped the region in the past 15 years, <strong><em>further international engagement and an exchange of knowledge in sustainable agriculture, will bring much needed resources and technology to the region.</em></strong></p>
<p>The implementation of a sustainable agricultural model in the region is intended to serve as an active transfer of technical knowledge to the local population. This education component will ultimately improve quality of life in the region through the creation of rural employment and improved agriculture outputs.</p>
<p>In addition, the local ecosystem will be directly affected by agriculture due to the natural exchange of agriculture and ecosystem services. Over time, this synergy has a direct effect on local climate, by further improving the quality of the soil, cooling the region, creating more rain, increasing biodiversity, building crop resistance to plagues and diseases.</p>
<h3><strong>Factors</strong></h3>
<p>Prior to implementation of this project a series of factors must be examined. Any engineering solution proposed will be planned and designed in accordance to the current natural local resources, and heavily relying on the feedback of the local population. A more detailed plan of action will be possible upon return from the planned assessment trip to the region.</p>
<p><strong><em>Agricultural factors:</em></strong><br/><br/> The main factors that influence efficiency of agriculture practices include the climatic conditions, soil type and structure, crop type and irrigation techniques. These factors will be evaluated through a series of physical and chemical tests conducted on site with soil and water testing equipment.</p>
<p><br/> The practice of polyculture, which attempts to replicate nature’s tendency to diversify ecosystem through the use of multiple and alternating crops, improves local biodiversity, decreases plant susceptibility to diseases and pest control. Evidence suggests that management systems that emphasize crop diversity through the use of polycultures, crop rotations and agroforestry can often reduce the abundance of insect pests that specialize on a particular crop, while providing refuge and alternative prey for natural enemies (Andow 1991). These factors directly affect the environmental synergies, becoming part of the local ecosystem’s feedback loop.</p>
<p><strong><em>Water source and quality: </em></strong><br/><br/> The depth and accessibility of the underlying aquifer is important in order to establish whether source will be sufficient for the size of plots and types of crops being considered. Crops differ both in terms of their daily water needs and the duration of their total growing period. The crop type is therefore an important factor in determining irrigation water needs. In addition, the quality of water must be tested to identify whether treatment is necessary prior to agricultural use.</p>
<p><strong><em>Wind pattern:</em></strong><br/><br/> For the purposes of this proposed model of sustainable agriculture, wind patterns must be studied to ensure feasibility of a wind powered water pump.</p>
<p><strong><em>Other available energy sources:</em></strong><br/><br/> While on site, the team will investigate the availability and nature of other energy sources in the area.</p>
<p><strong><em>Soil capacity and properties:</em></strong><br/><br/> Soil capacity is the ability of the soil to hold water between irrigation or precipitation events. Some determinants of soil capacity include soil depth, ratios of different soil particles that making up the soil, soil porosity, and soil water tension. These factors influence the amount of water available to the plants. Because soil properties change at various depths, it is important to know the soil capacity throughout the plant root zone.</p>
<p><strong><em>Crop selection:</em></strong><br/><br/> According to information provided by the community, ancient agricultural systems like the terrace farming were significant in the advance of the production system; it utilized massive manual labor for its construction and maintenance, took advantage of annual precipitation accumulation and facilitated intensive agriculture of polyculture crops of beans, corn and squash.</p>
<p><strong><em>Degree of erosion:</em></strong><br/><br/> It is estimated that 83% of the soils in the La Mixteca are mildly or moderately degraded and that 17% show signs of severe erosion.</p>
<p><strong><em>Community needs and social structure:</em></strong><br/><br/> To ensure sustainability of any agriculture model this project must be structured in the most natural manner for the local population. To achieve this goal, the traditional agriculture customs, and native crop type and cultivation methods must be incorporated into the final design. Additionally, in the region of La Mixteca Alta, many communities are structured as communal lands, or <em>ejidos</em>. This will be a factor in the determining the location for implementing a project of this nature. The social and political organization of the communities is also important in concluding feasibility and sustainability of the model.</p>

<p>The model has as its primary component the development of small-scale <em>drip-irrigation</em> systems that will be fed from the local underlying aquifer.

Any engineering solution proposed will be planned and designed in accordance to the current natural local resources, and heavily relying on the feedback of the local population. A more detailed plan of action will be possible upon return from the planned assessment trip to the region.
Agricultural factors: The main factors that influence efficiency of agriculture practices include the climatic conditions, soil type and structure, crop type and irrigation techniques. These factors will be evaluated through a series of physical and chemical tests conducted on site with soil and water testing equipment.
 The practice of polyculture, which attempts to replicate nature’s tendency to diversify ecosystem through the use of multiple and alternating crops, improves local biodiversity, decreases plant susceptibility to diseases and pest control.

This weed both crushes native species and produces a higher output of nitrogen, which harms the environment's ability to support the healthy ecosystem.Ijams stands as a sanctuary for countless animals that are uprooted from the city. When invasive species overtake an area, native wildlife is inadvertently harmed as the surrounding food supply and habitat becomes limited. We are raising money to remove these aggressive plants from Ijams and, therefore, revitalize wildlife in the region. For donations of $15 you receive a handwritten letter, for $25 you receive Ijams' decal, for $50 you receive an Ijams' water bottle, for $75 you receive a handcrafted, ceramic bowl or plate, and for $100 or more we will award the donor with an Ijams' membership.How This Helps The CommunityIjam's maintains a place for citizens of Knoxville to enjoy nature away from the metropolitan bustle of the city. Serving as a wildlife center, Ijam's teaches local youth to respect nature, which creates a greener future for the surrounding community. Preserving wildlife in the city also benefits the environment as a whole. Greater tree density sustains the environment while providing many health benefits to those living in the surrounding area.Protecting indigenous species preserves the habitat of Knoxville's local wildlife and maintains an ecosystem that remains exclusive to east Tennessee. The plants and animals that comprise this region are currently being attacked by invasive species. Ijam's strives to fight habitat destruction and foreign competition by replacing these invasive species with trees and undergrowth native to east Tennessee's local ecosystems.  Other Ways to HelpIf you remain unable to give this month but still desire to help, please share our campaign on Facebook and Twitter! Ijams always appreciates volunteers and visitors, so please consider spreading spreading the word and taking an afternoon adventure to the nature center. You can volunteer and learn more about IJAMs here.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

The High School swimming pool has been made available as a test basin.  This activity was considered beneficial to the students by the school authorities as they have the privilege to be participants in a state-of the-art renewable energy program. And more lately an interested technician, Peter Ricthie constructed another wave generator that will be used to generate scale model wind waves to test orthogonal wind and swell wave effects.</p><p>The AEEA organization gratefully acknowledges this assistance.  Other volunteers with suitable academic and professional credentials, such as Peter Anast, engineer experiencd in analytical studies of wave energy conversion,  Dr. Thomas Mathai, Senior Associate in Ocean Engineering and William Hurley Jr, Principal and COB, at The Glosten Associates a Seattle-based marine architectural firm, Dick Metz a retired Marine Architect serving as Program Manager of the Hydrofoil Ferry Program for the Boeing Company. Peter Anast performed analytical studies of wave energy conversion efficiency of linked vessels that included equal length rafts, and Thomas Mathai used the assistance of AEEA in a joint effort proposal to NOAA. William Hurley made cost estimates of unmodified barge costs. Dick Metz was the designer of the wave generator constructed by the Puyullap High School.  Jim Collins, helped by suggesting designs for hydraulic cylinders and rack and pinion designs and Sean Nelson of Custom Steel Works have assisted in two of our proposals to the DoE.   Gary Flores of NAVSEA Keyport, WA helped by rewriting a proposal previously submitted by us to the DoE, but for the use of forward based fleets  and an introductory technical meeting with NAVSEA, Keyport.  Jason Schuler, a former nuclear technician and now an operations analyst, is assisting with chemical processing and business at the NAES Corp.,  has taken interest in our chemical processing and contributed to our business promotion.  And most recently George Bieda, a retired Navy Captain and nuclear engineer, is assisting with computer modeling and liaison with the US Navy's efforts to produce jet fuel at sea, using a process similar to the ORCA system.</p><p>And not least of all the assistance we received was that from the chemist, Meyer Steinberg, the inventor of the three cell Electrolyzer used in the AEEA patent as a very efficient means of making Methanol, the feedstock for gasoline. He has assisted us in writing of proposals to numerous petroleum companies, the Methanol Institute and the Department of Energy.</p><p>We are exploring opportunities to collaborate with Dr. John Carter and other faculty and staff of the College of Science and Engineering at Seattle University to evaluate the relative merits of four different mechanizations of wave energy convertors.</p><br/><p></p><p></p></div>","The current product of emphasis is  synthetic gasoline; however other hydrocarbon fuels such as methanol, diesel, jet fuel and a substitute for natural gas – dimethyl ether (DME).  These  may be produced with similar equipment and  processing approach.Environmental impact summary of the ORCA systemThe name Orca was chosen because of the oxygen replacing and carbon absorbing properties of our system.  Every gallon of synthetic gasoline we produce will release 19.4 pounds of oxygen and absorb 17.7 pounds of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Each of these floating factories would produce 5 million gallons of synthetic gasoline per year, represents a 20 acre footprint and consumes 40,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year.  If we were the sole source for the 135 billion gallons of gasoline consumed in the United States each year we would remove 1.08 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide each year while only utilizing an ocean surface area equivalent to a 29 by 29 mile square. The Orca system also compares favorably with bio-fuel. An acre of soybeans will yield ethanol equivalent to 40 gallons of gasoline per acre per year and remove 16 metric tons of carbon dioxide.  Our Orca system produces 250,000 gallons of synthetic gasoline per acre of ocean surface per year and removes 2,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year without displacing crops, forest, or pastureland. The synthetic gasoline we produce has the same carbon dioxide content as gasoline with 10% ethanol (17.68 lbs/gal.) and can be utilized without any changes to our vehicles or fuel delivery infrastructure. Synthetic gasoline produced by our system would provide the same level of economy and performance as the gasoline we are presently using.  Straight gasoline (without ethanol) has a carbon dioxide content of 19.64 lbs/gal.  So we not only provide a lower carbon dioxide content gasoline that will operate seamlessly in our current vehicles, but we also reclaim that same amount of carbon dioxide from the air (or seawater) when we create each new gallon of synthetic gasoline.  Now that's recycling.  We have chosen to scrub the carbon dioxide from the air rather than from seawater because extracting it from the air provides $0.17 per gallon credit through the sale of carbon credits on the international market.Since the ORCA fleets operate on the Continental Shelves, the fleets to not degrade the aesthetics: no windmills to spoil the views, no intrusion into the coastal areas to be the sites of anchored, near coastal wave conversions sites that are being considered. No spoiling the commercial or recreational fishing, surfing and beach recreational sites.  One might think that such a source and production of renewable energy would be expensive, and probably need subsidies and government mandatory consumer rules  such as exists by the ethanol industry.  In fact, the production and distribution of ORCA renewable fuel should undercut the price of gasoline at the pump after its  further  development and introduction. Capital investment in this new industry would  result in an impressive  return on investment. The AEEA Business PlanThe long term business plan is to develop the ORCA concept to a sufficient  level of maturity to organizations  capable and willing to complete its  development,  introduce the  product into the national economy and will buy or lease our intellectual property. To attract potential investors it may be  necessary to develop the ORCA concept beyond its present level of maturity.  The AEEA group will achieve  this level through further technical and promotional increments. This crowd funding effort will be used  to finance continued system development and promotional activities. If we are fortunate enough to receive funding beyond our committed  goal, we will enhance our estimates of size, shape and performance of the principal system components. This invention has been conceived by retired, independent consultants without the assistance of the systematic research and development laboratories routinely  performed by  major industrial or academic institutional organizations.  The  senior partners of AEEA have spent most of their careers working in those organizations  (see resumes on our web site) and have had to improvise and stretch limited funding.  Since these resources have not been available, investment in the enterprise has been entirely  provided by the partnership and greatly assisted by  volunteers providing technical council and access to simulated wave facilities. All theoretical and applied engineering and financial analyses, model development and testing has been performed in-house (or in garages!) and improvised wave simulation facilities. The crowd funding received in this phase of development will enable us to pay for the help needed from volunteers. AEEA senior partners will draw no money from the crowd funding sources.  Short Term Planning – Advanced Model Construction and Testing at the Puyallup High School (PHS)- The short term goal would be crowd funded and would complete the instrumentation and  support the testing of the existing four  8’x4’ models and wave generation system developed and constructed by student volunteers and their Vocational teacher, Mr. Macdonald  of the Puyallup High School, Puyallup, Washington (PHS). The  high school swimming pool and their wave generation system would make use of the PHS pool facility  if and when available. If the PHS pool is not available, one of several  suitable small lakes in the vicinity will be used. Linkages, power take off devices, a measurement system, data recording and reduction and documentation would be performed. The results of earlier testing using existing four 4’ models will be  used to obtain scaling data and  a baseline performance comparison with the larger models. Since the patent proposal was submitted, other power take off devices have been suggested for examination for possible improvements in efficiency beyond the baseline hydraulic approach. If funding is available, candidate mechanisms including Rack and Pinion, Ball Screw drives, and Linear Permanent Magnet generation may be considered for incorporation in the  models after completion of trade studies. This data will be used to project performance to full scale barge flotillas.Possible extensions of near term activities –If the committed crowd funding goals were exceeded or became  available from other sources, the following candidate increments of development will be performed as useful follow- on activities:These increments of activity would include the preliminary design of the Steinberg Atmospheric CO2  to Gasoline method based on his two patents. It is anticipated that the next increment of development would include the  testing and display of advanced models at the Hinsdale Wave Energy Laboratory operated by the Oregon State University, in Corvallis, Oregon.  As part of these long term goals, recent interest by  the Seattle University and our cadre of volunteers may result in teaming for National Science Foundation  grant applications to sponsor advanced technology tasks.  Examples include  preliminary development work on the adaptive wave  resonance system described in the AEEA patent which will optimize or “tune” the fleet to varying wave lengths, amplitudes, phases and direction.The Importance of Your HelpAn exceptional opportunity to participate in this breakthrough, “game changing “ energy quest exists. You contributors are at the most important stage of the Concept  Development Phase. This  goal will  enable AEEA to collect data  providing the assurance   to potential private investor or government sponsorship to support the development of prototype hardware and software. Your contributions should change the direction of renewable energy research directed to the stabilization of global warming through the reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere. In addition you can assist in the seamless conversion of an economy based on gasoline to one of methanol or other clean automotive fuels as those become feasible. We will strive to meet or exceed our modest goal of $50,000 for period of time negotiated with Indiegogo of 45 days.AEEA needs your help in other ways as well. The technology required to establish this concept covers the state-of-art in chemical processing, software development, electronic and electrical engineering, oceanography and marine engineering. We have some gallant volunteers at this time, but if others would like to participate in this exciting area please read our web site and contact us. We need every one interested in these goals to contact their representatives in government to awaken them to the possibilities described in this program and to  call for support to this effort from the appropriate government research organizations.Volunteer AssistanceA highly supportive article in the Seattle Times newspaper of November 11, 2010 (Reporter Danny Westneat) resulted in a number of volunteers providing assistance to the ORCA concept  development.  Vocational Arts classes of the Puyallup, WA High School, taught by Alex McDonald,  have been assisting the ORCA effort in the construction of eight foot barge models a motor driven wave generator and model testing. The High School swimming pool has been made available as a test basin.  This activity was considered beneficial to the students by the school authorities as they have the privilege to be participants in a state-of the-art renewable energy program. And more lately an interested technician, Peter Ricthie constructed another wave generator that will be used to generate scale model wind waves to test orthogonal wind and swell wave effects.The AEEA organization gratefully acknowledges this assistance.  Other volunteers with suitable academic and professional credentials, such as Peter Anast, engineer experiencd in analytical studies of wave energy conversion,  Dr. Thomas Mathai, Senior Associate in Ocean Engineering and William Hurley Jr, Principal and COB, at The Glosten Associates a Seattle-based marine architectural firm, Dick Metz a retired Marine Architect serving as Program Manager of the Hydrofoil Ferry Program for the Boeing Company. Peter Anast performed analytical studies of wave energy conversion efficiency of linked vessels that included equal length rafts, and Thomas Mathai used the assistance of AEEA in a joint effort proposal to NOAA. William Hurley made cost estimates of unmodified barge costs. Dick Metz was the designer of the wave generator constructed by the Puyullap High School.  Jim Collins, helped by suggesting designs for hydraulic cylinders and rack and pinion designs and Sean Nelson of Custom Steel Works have assisted in two of our proposals to the DoE.   Gary Flores of NAVSEA Keyport, WA helped by rewriting a proposal previously submitted by us to the DoE, but for the use of forward based fleets  and an introductory technical meeting with NAVSEA, Keyport.  Jason Schuler, a former nuclear technician and now an operations analyst, is assisting with chemical processing and business at the NAES Corp.,  has taken interest in our chemical processing and contributed to our business promotion.  And most recently George Bieda, a retired Navy Captain and nuclear engineer, is assisting with computer modeling and liaison with the US Navy's efforts to produce jet fuel at sea, using a process similar to the ORCA system.And not least of all the assistance we received was that from the chemist, Meyer Steinberg, the inventor of the three cell Electrolyzer used in the AEEA patent as a very efficient means of making Methanol, the feedstock for gasoline. He has assisted us in writing of proposals to numerous petroleum companies, the Methanol Institute and the Department of Energy.We are exploring opportunities to collaborate with Dr. John Carter and other faculty and staff of the College of Science and Engineering at Seattle University to evaluate the relative merits of four different mechanizations of wave energy convertors.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>Hi! We are Kids 4 Hydrogen, a group of students and young adults dedicated to developing a sustainable energy infrastructure in the United States. Fossil fuels not only release harmful greenhouse gases when burned, but they are also a limited, dwindling resource in this country. Hydrogen fuel cells offer a promising solution to this resource crisis because it harnesses the energy potential of hydrogen, a widely available resource. <br/><br/>Hydrogen fuel cell cars are already being manufactured, but not many people are willing to buy them due to a lack of hydrogen refueling stations throughout the country. We are going to travel through California in a fuel cell car to educate the public about hydrogen technology, simultaneously showing car companies that the public is interested in their fuel cell cars. Mercedes has agreed to let us drive their F-Cell (the “invisible car”) on our tour.  </p>
<p><img alt=""Mercedes F-Cell"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://meritworld.com/images/f_cell_jump.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Kids 4 Hydrogen team test drives the Invisible Car!""/><br/><br/>We will also be displaying the new impressive home-power system, the Joule Box, a smart energy system that can easily integrate any renewable source (solar, wind, etc.), and store energy using both hydrogen and battery technologies. We are very excited to be presenting the Joule Box on our tour, and the Joule Box will be on permanent display at the Kids 4 Hydrogen headquarters at Merit Academy in Santa Cruz County.  To make this 10-day fuel cell tour possible, we need to raise $62,650 to fund travel, presentation, and Joule Box expenses.</p>
<p><img alt=""Joule Box"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.meritworld.com/images/joule%20box.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Joule Box""/><br/><br/></p>
<p><strong>The Cause</strong><br/>Imagine a world without cars. Now imagine a world with unpredictable, severe weather and insufferable pollution problems.  At the rate that we are using fossil fuels, one of these two worlds will be ours in just a few decades. Our consumption of finite resources is not only unsustainable, but it also releases harmful greenhouse gases that contribute to the overall deterioration of the planet.<br/><br/>However, there is hope.  Independent researchers have made incredible progress in developing hydrogen fuel cells to create a sustainable energy infrastructure for the future. The technology is here -- now; all we need is consumer awareness and momentum.<br/><br/>Global warming is not a future problem; it is a pressing issue that must be solved by building a renewable energy infrastructure to meet the world’s needs.<br/><br/><strong>The Problem</strong><br/>While there are a number of hydrogen fueling stations in Southern California, the rest of the state has yet to build them. All major car companies have hydrogen fuel cell cars ready to put on the assembly line but they will not put these cars into production until they know that the public will buy them.  Refueling stations take approximately two years to build and will only be built when there are enough hydrogen fuel cell cars on the road to demand them.  This “Chicken and Egg” dilemma is the problem!  <br/><br/><strong>The Solution</strong><br/>To solve this Chicken and Egg problem, we have started a waiting list on our Kids 4 Hydrogen website.  Visitors can view their hydrogen fuel cell car options and select their favorite car. Our goals are to introduce fuel cell cars to Californians and educate them about our need to stop purchasing gasoline-guzzling internal-combustion engine vehicles.  When 55,000 people sign the list to demonstrate their interest in purchasing a hydrogen fuel cell car in 2015, this will give fueling station developers the numbers they need to start building hydrogen fueling stations throughout California.  The solution is with the people. When we, the people, sign up for hydrogen fuel cell cars, both car manufacturers and refueling stations will begin production to build the clean sustainable car-refueling solution we need.  The Joule Box can provide energy to remote areas where the hydrogen infrastructure does not reach and to supplement areas where clean alternative energy is not available.</p>
<p><strong>Who Are We?</strong></p>
<p>Founded in 2004, Kids 4 Hydrogen is an educational outreach organization consisting of eight students from California. Kids 4 Hydrogen’s goal is to lead America in developing a sustainable energy infrastructure that will meet the world’s needs in 2050.  By giving demonstrations of how fuel cells work and presenting the hydrogen fuel cell vehicles on well-publicized tours, we hope to encourage people to get on our waiting list to purchase fuel cell vehicles to move toward a sustainable hydrogen economy.<br/><br/>On our 10-day hydrogen car tour, we will be driving the Mercedes F-Cell to various public and private venues to raise awareness about global warming and hydrogen fuel cell technology. We will also be debuting the Joule Box; a “smart” home-energy system designed to easily integrate hydrogen and renewable technologies to power homes. After our tour, the Joule Box will be permanently featured in Northern California as an educational tool for public demonstration of hydrogen technologies.<br/><br/>The tour is set to take place during the summer of 2013 or as soon as we raise the necessary funds, but we need your help to fund presentation expenses, the Joule Box, and travel costs to make this tour possible.<br/><br/><strong>What We Need </strong><br/>We need $62,650 to cover this 10-Day Hydrogen Fuel Cell Tour.</p>
<p>$1850 - Permits for various sites where the tour will stop.</p>
<p>$7,610 - Kids 4 Hydrogen Coordinators (Director, Office Assistant, Website Manager, Graphic Designer, Video Producer, Bookkeeper). Our director will organize the entire 10-day tour by working with Mercedes to secure the hydrogen fuel cell car, arranging to have hydrogen gas delivered at demonstration sites, and coordinating the travel arrangements.  She will also work with Hydrogen House to build the demonstration model of the Joule Box for our tour.  The office assistant will work with the Kids 4 Hydrogen team, families, and teachers to make sure that team completes all paperwork and contracts and parents sign liability and travel releases. Our website manager and graphic designer will work with the team to design and prepare all printed materials: brochures, information sheets, business cards, bumper stickers, sign-up forms, etc. ).  Our videographer will film the 10-day tour and produce an educational video for the Kids 4 Hydrogen website and YouTube.</p>
<p>$9,510 - Presentation Materials (Brochures, Display Systems, Portable TV Monitor, Banners, Information Sheets, Sound System, T-shirts, Photo Albums, Demonstration Kits, Photography).  These costs will cover our printed materials that we will give to guests at each venue.  It also includes our display boards, tables, and everything we need to do our presentations both indoors and outdoors.  We’ll be giving a slideshow presentation as well as the ride-and-drive experience for guests.  Our goal is to get the guests excited by our professional presentation and demonstration.  </p>
<p>$13,680 - Travel and Transportation Expenses (Rental, Trailer, Airfare, Hotel, Per Diem).  Our team will be on the road for 10 days.  </p>
<p>$30,000- Covers the cost of building and shipping the Joule Box for our 10-day tour.  The Joule Box will include a wind turbine, solar panels, hydrogen fuel cell, electrolyzer, inverter, storage tanks, and batteries.  It will also include a smart energy calculator that will determine daily power consumption and energy storage needs. The Joule Box will be on permanent display and available for educational demonstrations at Merit Academy.  <br/><br/>We are confident that we’ll reach our goal for our 10-Day Hydrogen Fuel Cell Tour, but if we don’t quite reach our goal by our deadline, we will reduce the number of days of the tour and present the Mercedes F-Cell and Joule Box at the highest profile venues and cities.  <br/><br/><strong>The Impact</strong><br/>Your contribution will give Kids 4 Hydrogen the funds to educate Californians about the eminent need to build a hydrogen infrastructure now.  If we continue to drive internal-combustion engine vehicles and rely on fossil fuels without developing a sustainable alternative now, we won’t have enough time to build the fuel cell fleets and hydrogen fueling stations when we run out of petroleum.  <br/><br/>We can’t rely on the oil companies, government, or auto industry to supply clean sustainable fuel options in a timeframe that will reduce CO2 emissions and stop climate change.  It’s up to people like you, people who understand that climate change will continue to cause worldwide devastation, who can contribute funds to help Kids 4 Hydrogen educate others to make smarter choices about the cars they drive and the fuel they use.<br/><br/><strong>About Us</strong><br/>Kids 4 Hydrogen’s founder, Jaclyn D’Arcy, was 9 years old when she joined Merit Academy’s Hydrogen Fuel Cell team in 1998.  We were the first middle school students in the world to build a fuel cell.  We toured the nation and spoke at the Renewable Energy Caucus in Washington DC, eco conventions across the country, California universities (Stanford, Berkeley, and more), high schools, middle schools and elementary schools. To cover the costs of these tours, we received over $45,000 in funding from the Dept of Energy, museums, conventions, foundations, and individuals.

<p><br/>Thank you for your interest and support!<br/><br/> </p></div>","Hi! We are Kids 4 Hydrogen, a group of students and young adults dedicated to developing a sustainable energy infrastructure in the United States. Fossil fuels not only release harmful greenhouse gases when burned, but they are also a limited, dwindling resource in this country. Hydrogen fuel cells offer a promising solution to this resource crisis because it harnesses the energy potential of hydrogen, a widely available resource. Hydrogen fuel cell cars are already being manufactured, but not many people are willing to buy them due to a lack of hydrogen refueling stations throughout the country. We are going to travel through California in a fuel cell car to educate the public about hydrogen technology, simultaneously showing car companies that the public is interested in their fuel cell cars. Mercedes has agreed to let us drive their F-Cell (the “invisible car”) on our tour.  
We will also be displaying the new impressive home-power system, the Joule Box, a smart energy system that can easily integrate any renewable source (solar, wind, etc.), and store energy using both hydrogen and battery technologies. We are very excited to be presenting the Joule Box on our tour, and the Joule Box will be on permanent display at the Kids 4 Hydrogen headquarters at Merit Academy in Santa Cruz County.  To make this 10-day fuel cell tour possible, we need to raise $62,650 to fund travel, presentation, and Joule Box expenses.

The CauseImagine a world without cars. Now imagine a world with unpredictable, severe weather and insufferable pollution problems.  At the rate that we are using fossil fuels, one of these two worlds will be ours in just a few decades. Our consumption of finite resources is not only unsustainable, but it also releases harmful greenhouse gases that contribute to the overall deterioration of the planet.However, there is hope.  Independent researchers have made incredible progress in developing hydrogen fuel cells to create a sustainable energy infrastructure for the future. The technology is here -- now; all we need is consumer awareness and momentum.Global warming is not a future problem; it is a pressing issue that must be solved by building a renewable energy infrastructure to meet the world’s needs.The ProblemWhile there are a number of hydrogen fueling stations in Southern California, the rest of the state has yet to build them. All major car companies have hydrogen fuel cell cars ready to put on the assembly line but they will not put these cars into production until they know that the public will buy them.  Refueling stations take approximately two years to build and will only be built when there are enough hydrogen fuel cell cars on the road to demand them.  This “Chicken and Egg” dilemma is the problem!  The SolutionTo solve this Chicken and Egg problem, we have started a waiting list on our Kids 4 Hydrogen website.  Visitors can view their hydrogen fuel cell car options and select their favorite car. Our goals are to introduce fuel cell cars to Californians and educate them about our need to stop purchasing gasoline-guzzling internal-combustion engine vehicles.  When 55,000 people sign the list to demonstrate their interest in purchasing a hydrogen fuel cell car in 2015, this will give fueling station developers the numbers they need to start building hydrogen fueling stations throughout California.  The solution is with the people. When we, the people, sign up for hydrogen fuel cell cars, both car manufacturers and refueling stations will begin production to build the clean sustainable car-refueling solution we need.  The Joule Box can provide energy to remote areas where the hydrogen infrastructure does not reach and to supplement areas where clean alternative energy is not available.
Who Are We?
Founded in 2004, Kids 4 Hydrogen is an educational outreach organization consisting of eight students from California. Kids 4 Hydrogen’s goal is to lead America in developing a sustainable energy infrastructure that will meet the world’s needs in 2050.  By giving demonstrations of how fuel cells work and presenting the hydrogen fuel cell vehicles on well-publicized tours, we hope to encourage people to get on our waiting list to purchase fuel cell vehicles to move toward a sustainable hydrogen economy.On our 10-day hydrogen car tour, we will be driving the Mercedes F-Cell to various public and private venues to raise awareness about global warming and hydrogen fuel cell technology. We will also be debuting the Joule Box; a “smart” home-energy system designed to easily integrate hydrogen and renewable technologies to power homes. After our tour, the Joule Box will be permanently featured in Northern California as an educational tool for public demonstration of hydrogen technologies.The tour is set to take place during the summer of 2013 or as soon as we raise the necessary funds, but we need your help to fund presentation expenses, the Joule Box, and travel costs to make this tour possible.What We Need We need $62,650 to cover this 10-Day Hydrogen Fuel Cell Tour.
$1850 - Permits for various sites where the tour will stop.
$7,610 - Kids 4 Hydrogen Coordinators (Director, Office Assistant, Website Manager, Graphic Designer, Video Producer, Bookkeeper). Our director will organize the entire 10-day tour by working with Mercedes to secure the hydrogen fuel cell car, arranging to have hydrogen gas delivered at demonstration sites, and coordinating the travel arrangements.  She will also work with Hydrogen House to build the demonstration model of the Joule Box for our tour.  The office assistant will work with the Kids 4 Hydrogen team, families, and teachers to make sure that team completes all paperwork and contracts and parents sign liability and travel releases. Our website manager and graphic designer will work with the team to design and prepare all printed materials: brochures, information sheets, business cards, bumper stickers, sign-up forms, etc. ).  Our videographer will film the 10-day tour and produce an educational video for the Kids 4 Hydrogen website and YouTube.
$9,510 - Presentation Materials (Brochures, Display Systems, Portable TV Monitor, Banners, Information Sheets, Sound System, T-shirts, Photo Albums, Demonstration Kits, Photography).  These costs will cover our printed materials that we will give to guests at each venue.  It also includes our display boards, tables, and everything we need to do our presentations both indoors and outdoors.  We’ll be giving a slideshow presentation as well as the ride-and-drive experience for guests.  Our goal is to get the guests excited by our professional presentation and demonstration.  
$13,680 - Travel and Transportation Expenses (Rental, Trailer, Airfare, Hotel, Per Diem).  Our team will be on the road for 10 days.  
$30,000- Covers the cost of building and shipping the Joule Box for our 10-day tour.  The Joule Box will include a wind turbine, solar panels, hydrogen fuel cell, electrolyzer, inverter, storage tanks, and batteries.  It will also include a smart energy calculator that will determine daily power consumption and energy storage needs. The Joule Box will be on permanent display and available for educational demonstrations at Merit Academy.  We are confident that we’ll reach our goal for our 10-Day Hydrogen Fuel Cell Tour, but if we don’t quite reach our goal by our deadline, we will reduce the number of days of the tour and present the Mercedes F-Cell and Joule Box at the highest profile venues and cities.  The ImpactYour contribution will give Kids 4 Hydrogen the funds to educate Californians about the eminent need to build a hydrogen infrastructure now.  If we continue to drive internal-combustion engine vehicles and rely on fossil fuels without developing a sustainable alternative now, we won’t have enough time to build the fuel cell fleets and hydrogen fueling stations when we run out of petroleum.  We can’t rely on the oil companies, government, or auto industry to supply clean sustainable fuel options in a timeframe that will reduce CO2 emissions and stop climate change.  It’s up to people like you, people who understand that climate change will continue to cause worldwide devastation, who can contribute funds to help Kids 4 Hydrogen educate others to make smarter choices about the cars they drive and the fuel they use.About UsKids 4 Hydrogen’s founder, Jaclyn D’Arcy, was 9 years old when she joined Merit Academy’s Hydrogen Fuel Cell team in 1998.  We were the first middle school students in the world to build a fuel cell.  We toured the nation and spoke at the Renewable Energy Caucus in Washington DC, eco conventions across the country, California universities (Stanford, Berkeley, and more), high schools, middle schools and elementary schools. To cover the costs of these tours, we received over $45,000 in funding from the Dept of Energy, museums, conventions, foundations, and individuals. We have been featured in dozens of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV interviews, and documentaries since 1998.  We are now launching the most important piece of our outreach now.  Californians are restless about our energy future and they need to learn more about why they should purchase a hydrogen fuel cell car in 2015.  When California becomes the first state to build a hydrogen infrastructure (from San Diego to San Francisco/Sacramento), we’ll lead the nation in moving away from fossil fuels and towards a clean, sustainable energy source.Meet the Team:Jaclyn D'Arcy founded Kids 4 Hydrogen when she was in 9th grade.  She spoke at the American Lung Association's Breathe Easy Conference and she has worked with industry leaders to explore the hydrogen economy.

ES EARTHWIDEWALK?
EARTHWIDEWALK es una campaña única en la historia:
una vuelta al mundo a pie en solitario y en autosuficiencia, atravesando los
cinco continentes y con una duración aproximada de 5 años, lanzando un mensaje
de conservación y respeto por la naturaleza y el planeta Tierra, nuestra

OBJETIVOS DEL PROYECTO
Tratar de concienciar
de la urgente necesidad de cambiar unos hábitos y estilos de vida que están
explotando el planeta muy por encima de sus posibilidades (contaminación,
aceleración del cambio climático, destrucción de ecosistemas, extinción de
especies…), reflexionar sobre el legado que queremos dejar y las condiciones de
vida que queremos para nosotros mismos en el presente.
Contar una historia de superación, coraje y valentía
y apostar por un mundo mejor,
demostrar que no hay nada imposible ni más límites que aquellos que nosotros
queramos asumir, y que está en nuestras manos crear la realidad. Un proyecto de
todos y para todos. Porque las personas somos la energía que movemos el mundo.¿CÓMO ESTAMOS CONSIGUIENDO ESTOS OBJETIVOS?

EARTHWIDEWALK is a unique campaign in history, a walk around the world alone and self-sufficiency, all over five continents, in approximately five years, sending a message of conservation and respect for nature and the planet Earth, our beautiful home. Quite a challenge of physical endurance and mental toughness.

Why Donate to the Adopt A Ranger Program: Your donation will help to put more park rangers on the ground for FCD.   With a cadre of park rangers, FCD can provide better monitoring coverage of the area and allow for a more effective rotation of its rangers to patrol the area and collect data.  FCD works every year on grant proposals which are primarily granted and approved for office equipment, research work, upgrade to park and research facilities.   Your donation  will help in maintaining and improving its ranger program.  This demonstration of support also will help in future grant proposals for FCD .",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

As I worked on this business a story about a little girl ,named Grace, was brought to my attention. Grace lived in Nairobi, Africa with her mom and sister on dirt floors and a house the size of a bathroom. She and her sister had been out looking for jobs every day until they got in contact with an agency.  This agency promised Grace a passport, free plane ticket, a job in Saudi Arabia and lastly they would send the money she earned back to her family. My friend Jamie, who shared the story with me, decided to check this agency out for herself since sex trafficking is rampant in their area. After catching the traffickers in numerous lies and no direct contact info where Grace would be working, she decided it would not be safe to go. Grace explained the situation to her mother and was told that she was selfish and needs to go back in the morning to beg for her job back. Grace went to the agency the next day, was given one phone call to say goodbye to her sister and has been missing since 2012. The Saving Grace Project is currently a pending 501C3 non profit. I am going to Nairobi in May 2015 to visit the girls in the city and choose five to start the project with.  They desperately need jobs with consistent pay and once they reach the age many girls already expressed a desire to attend college and funds raised will help pay their tuition. While I am there I will observe them and their community and set up jobs that will be a benefit to both. I need  to raise $34,000 to begin this process and meet their needs.  Lastly, I went on a research trip to London and Greece April of 2014. During this trip we visited A-21 an anti trafficking organization in Europe and learned how difficult, twisted and complicated sex trafficking really is. The things I learned about and witnessed is life changing. Girls as young as 11 are lied to and abused until they are mentally broken.  Trafficking operations are all over the world and spreading quickly. How they choose their victims is down to a science from specific personality traits to being poor, jobless and unwanted. The best thing to do is provide work and education for potential victims.  I want to do both for my five girls and will add many more.

baleen whales -- including the fin whale, second largest animal on earth -- have begun reinvading the temperate fjords of British Columbia's
north coast, where they forage intensively and socialize, just as a suite of
oil and natural gas tanker routes have been proposed for the area. We must rush
to document this unprecedented concentration of inland whales before any
impacts from maritime development can take effect. As a PhD student at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, I have devoted my dissertation to learning more about the whales of the Great Bear before that opportunity is lost. In summer 2013, I conducted four months of visual, acoustic, and oceanographic surveys within a broad transect of the northern fjords aboard my 12m research sloop, the SV Bangarang. I now have a proof of concept for this project, a fine-tuned survey design, preliminary data, and some remarkable stories. I now need the means of getting back out there for Season Two. ImpactAcademic: This is a project in pure discovery. Many aspects of this remote fjordland's ecosystem are poorly studied, and BC is the only place fin whales have been studied in a fjord setting. 
As baleen whale populations continue to recover from 20th century whaling, how
and to what extent will they come to rely on this habitat? Conversely, what is the
potential importance of these whales to the ecological function of BC's north
coast?Applied: My research will provide a baseline for the pre-tanker ecology of their habitat, as well as a basis for mitigating possible impacts. These remarkable inland whale populations are facing developments that would impact economies -- both human and natural -- across North America. This remote sanctuary is now of public concern, and to study them I am looking for public support. Personal: It may be a rare thing that a PhD project is also a dream come true. I am unbelievably fortunate that I have found such a project, and I'm on fire about it. I can’t wait to get back out there. NeedsI've designed my project to be high-impact at low-cost.  For a full season (4 months) of PhD-level ecosystem research on the SV Bangarang, my budget is less than that of operating a Scripps research vessel for half a day. Unfortunately, as a PhD student operating my own research vessel, my project falls between the cracks of small student grants and large post-doctoral grants. 
Barebones Needs: $10,000
For Season Two to happen at all, this minimum would cover the cost of fuel, food for three crew, and a few essential pieces of equipment.
High-Value Improvements: An additional $20,000.
In addition to these necessities, there are some small investments that would substantially improve the quality, consistency, and impact of the data I collect. These include:

Engine replace/rebuild: In 2013, we lost several weeks of critical research days to repairing the SV Bangarang's 33-year old 45 hp diesel. Improving the reliability of our vessel is the single-most effective change I could make for 2014. 


Travel assistance for crew: The crew of the Bangarang are some of the most dedicated, enthusiastic, and hard-working researchers I know, and they fight for this project without pay or compensation. As a meager thanks, I want to cover their travel expenses to and from the remote study site in 2014.


Equipment Improvements: Specific items that will allow us to sample farther, deeper, longer, and more precisely than in season one. These include: A motorized line hauler to increase the number of zooplankton tows we can take;  back-up underwater microphones so that we don't become paralyzed by equipment breakdown; a raised sighting platform for visual surveys; a net and imaging system that allows us to sample for phytoplankton. 

Overhead: An additional $5,000 to cover Indiegogo fees, third-party payment service charges, and UCSD overhead costs. No support will go towards salaries, wages, or non-business-related expenses.Regardless of whether I reach my fundraising mark, all support I receive will go a long, long way in making Season Two happen. Other Ways You Can HelpSpread the word and stay informed.

</h3>
<h3><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#008F58"">“Pacha’s Pajamas” is an edutainment platform that brings alive the voice of nature at a critical time for the planet. Through nature’s eye view and comical renditions of nature’s voices, we tell a story about how humanity is affecting the millions of other species and ecological systems and how each of us can change this story. Animating the voices of nature with music and humor allows much greater latitude in the urgency of this message and expands the potential for collective action. Connecting a global advocacy campaign such as Nature’s Rights to this type of platform opens up major market potential for ecological content in the entertainment industry.<br/></font></span></h3>
<h3><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#478F29"">Why is a story like ""Pacha's Pajamas"" so important?</font></h3>

Organizations of all forms are beginning to intentionally use story as a way to express their values and thereby emotionally connect with customers and constituencies. Because stories are the most accessible mode of values expression, shared story or (narrative) is the heart of collective action.

</div></div>","Our Story

The story begins with a young girl named Pacha who longs for the ocean and forest beyond the polluted city she lives in. Her dreams are the only way to imagine a different world. After receiving a new pair of pajamas that her mother made, she goes to sleep and dreams of the biggest concert ever on planet earth! From singing carrots to breakdancing dolphins, the species of the earth come together in this huge festival of all beings. And yet, no humans were invited. 

What is ""Pacha's Pajamas"" all about?

“Pacha’s Pajamas” is an edutainment platform that brings alive the voice of nature at a critical time for the planet. Through nature’s eye view and comical renditions of nature’s voices, we tell a story about how humanity is affecting the millions of other species and ecological systems and how each of us can change this story. Animating the voices of nature with music and humor allows much greater latitude in the urgency of this message and expands the potential for collective action. Connecting a global advocacy campaign such as Nature’s Rights to this type of platform opens up major market potential for ecological content in the entertainment industry.
Why is a story like ""Pacha's Pajamas"" so important?
At this moment of great peril and opportunity, the world is waking up to the power of story. Organizations of all forms are beginning to intentionally use story as a way to express their values and thereby emotionally connect with customers and constituencies. Because stories are the most accessible mode of values expression, shared story or (narrative) is the heart of collective action. If organizations and people can create joint narratives, we can start working together at an entirely new level.  And that is exactly what we need right now - humanity needs to sober up to the reality of limits and use them as creative constraints that define contours of the solutions we dream into reality. 
Who We AreWe are edutainers. Our aim is to leverage edutainment to help catalyze a shift in human consciousness whereby we work together to repair our relations with Mother Earth and each other. We see incredible potential in an emergent story called Pacha’s Pajamas about nature uniting to bring balance to a planet in turmoil. We think that children and adults alike will be better able to embrace the reality of our situation if it comes from the mouths of animals and plants, includes humor, and has a popular music inspired soundscape. And that’s what we do.

<p>Help my music business offset 23.6 tons of C02 emissions over the next five years by joining me in an effort to raise enough funds to purchase a Toyota Prius!</p>
<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>
<p>Hey Folks! My name is Tom Burgess, and I play my acoustic guitar all over New England, playing roughly 170 shows every year.<span>  </span>While it is a great time travelling through New England in my 1995 Ford F-150, I have become extremely concerned with the carbon emissions that result from my travels. When carbon is emitted into the atmosphere, it captures the suns energy, and turns it into heat via the greenhouse effect. This contributes to global warming, coastal inundation, severe weather shocks, droughts, and water shortages. <span> </span>In 2012, I drove 12,137 miles from my southern Rhode Island home to shows in New England and New York.</p>
<p>12,317 miles driven in my Ford F-150 results in 7.37 tons of carbon emissions every year! That is entirely unacceptable! This is the problem. My Ford can last me another 5 years, and after 5 years at my current pace, my carbon footprint would be 36.85 tons of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere from my vehicle alone.</p>
<p><strong>The Solution</strong></p>
<p>12,317 miles driven in a Toyota Prius would result in a reduction of 23.6 tons of carbon emissions versus my Ford F-150 over the next five years. That number is huge! Please help me reduce my carbon footprint!</p>
<p>You may ask why I own a Ford F-150 if I care so much about the environment. The reason is because it was a reliable low cost vehicle, and has the famed “straight six” engine, which would last me forever. That’s the problem though -- it will last forever.</p>
<p>If you help me raise enough funds, I will buy the best Prius that I can with the money that you donate.</p>
<p><strong>Other Action Steps for my Business to Become More Sustainable </strong></p>
<p>I have identified that my two greatest negative impacts to society are through my carbon emissions, and from the waste created from my profession.

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>     In June of this year, President Obama laid out his ""Climate Action Plan"" to ""reduce carbon emissions, prepare the U.S. for the impacts of climate change, and lead international efforts to address global climate change."" These proposals are an improvement on previous plans put forward by the Administration, but they still don't reduce our emissions to the levels that scientists and policy experts say industrialized countries need to reach in order to avoid the worst impacts of a dramatically warmer planet.</p>

<p>     Concerned by the fact that our country—one of the world's leading economies and political superpowers—had nothing that remotely resembled a national energy strategy despite constant concerns over energy security, a seemingly unquenchable demand for energy, an unfolding climate crisis, and years of political posturing, Evan, Matt, and Michael set out from Wesleyan Univeristy in May to create a comprehensive energy plan that the Obama Administration could embrace.<br/></p>

<p>Dear _____,</p>
<p>I’d like to share with you a campaign dedicated to solving an issue all-too-often overlooked in politics. Two recent graduates from Wesleyan University, along with one of their professors, started a group called ""U.S. Climate Plan"" and came up with a national energy strategy that will slash our trade deficit and reliance on foreign sources of energy, reduce our vulnerability to oil price shocks, and put our greenhouse gas emissions on a trajectory that can actually ensure that we avoid the great threat of a fundamentally altered climate. They just came out with a new report called <i>The Plan: How the U.S. Can Help Stabilize the Climate and Create a Clean Energy Future</i>, a comprehensive document that has been extensively researched and reviewed by some of the top policy experts, academics, and scientists. They have since started a fundraising campaign in order to further engage with media and elevate the national dialogue around bold climate and energy solutions.</p>
<p>That’s where you come in: they need additional funds in order to fully dedicate themselves to Phase 2, the outreach and promotional phase of <i>The Plan</i>. By November 17<sup>th</sup>, U.S. Climate Plan must raise $11,183. They have made great progress, but they need to keep the momentum going. You can check out <a href=""http://igg.me/at/theplan"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://igg.me/at/theplan</a> to get a better idea of what their campaign is all about and contribute.

1. Summary2. So Far... 3. About Us4. Phase 25. Phase 36. Phase 47: Budgets8. The Impact of Your Support9. Other Ways You Can Help10: Perks!

Summary
     In June of this year, President Obama laid out his ""Climate Action Plan"" to ""reduce carbon emissions, prepare the U.S. for the impacts of climate change, and lead international efforts to address global climate change."" These proposals are an improvement on previous plans put forward by the Administration, but they still don't reduce our emissions to the levels that scientists and policy experts say industrialized countries need to reach in order to avoid the worst impacts of a dramatically warmer planet.

So Far...

 Over the summer, we conducted extensive research to come  up with an alternative set of policies that the President and  Congress can embrace in order to get us within this safe range  of emissions reductions by 2020 and lead us to carbon  neutrality by 2050. We called this, Phase 1, which is compiled  in a report available for download on our website. Now, we are  trying to take our message to a broader audience in order to  elevate  the  national dialogue around climate change and show people that there are common-sense policy solutions that can help us overcome our energy challenges and usher in a new era of American prosperity and energy independence. We've gotten considerable media attention already, including an op-ed about us written in U.S. News & World Report.

About Us:
     Concerned by the fact that our country—one of the world's leading economies and political superpowers—had nothing that remotely resembled a national energy strategy despite constant concerns over energy security, a seemingly unquenchable demand for energy, an unfolding climate crisis, and years of political posturing, Evan, Matt, and Michael set out from Wesleyan Univeristy in May to create a comprehensive energy plan that the Obama Administration could embrace.


Evan Weber                  Matt Lichtash               Dr. Michael Dorsey

     Matt and Evan were classmates and roommates at Wesleyan, and both hold degrees in Economics and Environmental Studies. Dr. Michael K. Dorsey is a professor at Dartmouth College and was a visiting professor at Wesleyan's College of the Environment. Evan and Michael both served as 2012-2013 fellows in the College of the Environment Think Tank on Global Health and Environmental Justice, where the idea for The Plan was born.


Phase 2:





     The Plan has undergone extensive review by academics, politicians, scientists, advocates, and industry experts, and is now ready for the public. The next step in this process is to make sure that a lot of people see it, and that the right people see it. To do this we will be promoting these climate solutions through print, radio, television, social media, constituent outreach, and engagement with politicians and government officials. However, for us to be successful in this, we have to be able to really devote ourselves to it, and that's where you come in. Your support will allow us to sustain our efforts in moving real solutions forward and give us the extra push we need to gain the attention of the media and politicians to show them that we are all ready for bold action.

Phase 3:

     In order to really showcase our  ideas and further build support for  The Plan, we want to host a  conference. As of now, our goal is to  host it in April around Earth Day at  the place where the idea for The  Plan was born: Wesleyan University.  We have already begun the initial  planning stages for the conference  such as identifying and being in talks  with potential partners (and/or  funding sources) in the University, community, and other circles, but to successfully pull off the high profile event we have planned, it will require a lot more work and resources. We believe this conference can be highly successful at bringing in the best and brightest to convene around climate action and catalyze youth, students, and others forward in demanding solutions. (There is precedent for this, as well.)
Phase 4:During Phases 2 & 3, we will also be working on curating experts to expand The Plan into a more comprehensive document that details the impacts and effects of our proposed policies.This will help to bolster the feasibility of The Plan and show Americans what the specifics of real climate solutions would look like. The work for this will start as soon as we have the available funds, but we plan on pulling it all together after Phase 3. 



Budgets
Budget for Phase 2:


Salaries:

Evan: $13.67/hr (DC living wage)*40 hrs/week*4.29 weeks/month*2 months= $4,692 
Matt: $13.67/hr (DC living wage)*30 hrs/week*4.29 weeks/month*2 months= $3,519
Michael: $400 stipend


Sub-total=$8,611

Travel expenses:

Evan & Matt=$400
Michael: $400


Sub-total=$800

Office space: 
$400/month*2 months=$800

Sub-total=$800

Other overhead (including web services, supplies, etc.):
$120/month*2 months=$240

Processing fees: 

($8,611+$800+$800+240)*4% Indiegogo fees=$418


($8,611+$800+$800+240)*3% payment processing fees=$314

Sub-total=$732
Total= $11,183


If we don't reach our Phase 2 goal:
     We have opted for ""flexible funding."" What this means is that if we don't reach our goal, we still get to keep the funds we raise. Indiegogo recommends this funding option for campaigns that can still have an impact even if they are not fully funded. For us, this makes a lot of sense.

So even if we don't make our goal for Phase 2, your support will still help us to spread the word about The Plan and will hopefully give us the cushion we need to find other funding sources.

The Impact of Your Support     Unless we act aggressively and promptly, the world as we know it will be fundamentally changed. This isn't some far off threat anymore.

<div>Why use insects?</div>
<div><ul><li>The importance of insects to the structure and function of ecosystems cannot be overstated.  Insects are a critical connection between primary producers and top predators.  They act as a food source to higher organisms, but also as cleaning crews recycling decaying matter.  They are often the last to be extirpated from contaminated sites and first to recolonize once conditions improve.   Because of these reasons (and others), insects are very useful for monitoring environmental change.        </li></ul></div>

</li></ul>What is pollution? <ul><li>Pollution can be almost

pollution is so difficult for lawmakers to regulate and why

Pollution is any substance occurring at a concentration high enough to

toxic cyanide (used in gold mining) and certain pesticides which can directly
lead to death, to less toxic nitrogen and phosphorous compounds produced
by sewage and agricultural run-off. <br/>
</li></ul>What is environmental change?<ul><li>Environmental change is merely

is becoming increasing common in our human dominated world.  </li></ul>What is a free radical? <ul><li>A free radical is an extremely
reactive molecule containing electrons in unstable arrangements.  These unstable electrons seek stability by
any means necessary.  In order to achieve stability they react in a rampaging
frenzy with the body’s cellular machinery (including membranes, proteins and
DNA) causing harm to delicately balanced cellular processes.  </li></ul>Where do free radicals come from? <ul><li>Some free radicals are
natural.  They are the bi-products of normal processes including cells
producing energy from food.  Over one's lifetime, free radical damage increases during the
normal aging process due, in part, to the bodies deteriorating antioxidant
defense system.  However, large quantities of free-radicals can be
produced by pathogens, radiation and exposure to toxins.  Natural and
unnatural damage by free radicals is a leading theory for why all organisms age
(some prematurely) and eventually die. </li></ul>What is toxicity? <ul><li>Toxicity is a somewhat
abstract concept, although it can be simplified for our purposes as the
quantity of a substance required to damage an organism. </li></ul>

Who is conducting this research?


My name is Sam Duggan and I am a graduate student studying environmental contaminants at Colorado State University.  I have degrees in Molecular Biology and Ecology, but importantly I have substantial experience working on pristine and impacted ecosystems.  In recent years, I have focused on developing the laboratory skills required to take a biomedical approach to the conservation and repair of polluted ecosystems.  I am participating in a multi-institute, interdisciplinary study on the effects of toxic metals to aquatic ecosystems.  The larger project includes a team of graduate students, toxicologists, chemists, public health officials and additional stakeholders.

a change in conditions of the environment.  Whether due to  natural disaster, pollution, epidemic, climate, development or invasive species, environmental change
is becoming increasing common in our human dominated world.  What is a free radical? A free radical is an extremely
reactive molecule containing electrons in unstable arrangements.  These unstable electrons seek stability by
any means necessary.  In order to achieve stability they react in a rampaging
frenzy with the body’s cellular machinery (including membranes, proteins and
DNA) causing harm to delicately balanced cellular processes.  Where do free radicals come from? Some free radicals are
natural.  They are the bi-products of normal processes including cells
producing energy from food.  Over one's lifetime, free radical damage increases during the
normal aging process due, in part, to the bodies deteriorating antioxidant
defense system.  However, large quantities of free-radicals can be
produced by pathogens, radiation and exposure to toxins.  Natural and
unnatural damage by free radicals is a leading theory for why all organisms age
(some prematurely) and eventually die. What is toxicity? Toxicity is a somewhat
abstract concept, although it can be simplified for our purposes as the
quantity of a substance required to damage an organism.

<p><b>The
Hard Water Challenge:</b></p>
<ul><ul>
<li>Homeowners dealing with hard water suffer from scale
      damage to pipes,endure the degradation of water heaters and other cope
      with mineral deposits on dishes, shower doors and plumbing fixtures.</li>
<li>Current water softeners are either expensive,
      minimally effective, or require regular salt replenishment.</li>
<li>Regular maintenance of salt-based softeners is costly
      and requires a huge amount of personal effort--lugging salt bags around, changing
      them out and using water to flush the excess brine.</li>
<li>Current salt-based solutions create a brine by-product
      that pollutes our water: local municipalities aren’t able to filter it
      out of at the waste water treatment plants. </li>
</ul></ul>

<p><b>How Akwamag Can Help:</b></p>
<p>The <span>Akwamag uses High Intensity Multipass™ magnetic technology (patent pending) to:</span></p>
<ul><ul>
<li>Soften water at an unlimited capacity while requiring
      no maintenance</li>
<li>Protect the environment (and relieve your back
      muscles) by eliminating salt changes and brine dumping.</li>
<li>Yes, “High Intensity Multipass™ magnetic technology”
      is as cool as it sounds! And, it was developed by Tuyen Vo, a scientist
      and our founder.</li>
<li>It’s more affordable, effective, and eco-friendly than

Let's Talk Detail - The Long Version:


The
Hard Water Challenge:

Homeowners dealing with hard water suffer from scale
      damage to pipes,endure the degradation of water heaters and other cope
      with mineral deposits on dishes, shower doors and plumbing fixtures.
Current water softeners are either expensive,
      minimally effective, or require regular salt replenishment.
Regular maintenance of salt-based softeners is costly
      and requires a huge amount of personal effort--lugging salt bags around, changing
      them out and using water to flush the excess brine.
Current salt-based solutions create a brine by-product
      that pollutes our water: local municipalities aren’t able to filter it
      out of at the waste water treatment plants. 


How Akwamag Can Help:
The Akwamag uses High Intensity Multipass™ magnetic technology (patent pending) to:

Soften water at an unlimited capacity while requiring
      no maintenance
Protect the environment (and relieve your back
      muscles) by eliminating salt changes and brine dumping.
Yes, “High Intensity Multipass™ magnetic technology”
      is as cool as it sounds! And, it was developed by Tuyen Vo, a scientist
      and our founder.
It’s more affordable, effective, and eco-friendly than
      any water softener in the market.


Glamor Shot of an Akwamag Waiting for Installation:








We've seen the scale and damage done

Hard water left untreated can cause scale build-up on plumbing fixtures, which requires extra effort and wasted water to clean off. Scale build-up can clog water pipes and shorten the life of your home appliances. This leads to added cost, maintenance, and is a major inconvenience. And it's everywhere.                                  


Akwamag replaces salt softeners and improves the environment


So, why does anyone still buy salt-resin
water softeners? 


We’re not
sure. They probably haven’t heard about Akwamag yet. If you’re using a
salt-based water softener, you’re likely dealing with some of these issues:

It requires constant salt feeding which is a hassle.
It consumes salt and water, which both cost
      money.  According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, salt-softeners
      consume as much as 800 pounds of salts and 24,000 gallons of water a
      year. Read more about it, here! That water utilization is equivalent to
      2-months use per year. And here! An additional 10-25% more water is wasted
      due to unnecessary rinsing.
It releases a brine solution into the sewer, creating
      environment problems.

Unfortunately,
other available softeners like reverse osmosis, activated carbon, nanocrystal-seeding,
and strapped-on magnets are either very expensive or ineffective.  There
has not been a breakthrough water softener design that is both inexpensive and
effective in the last 30 years. It’s time to move this industry forward! 
Geek
Out — The Science Behind Akwamag:
Magnetic water softening has been
widely studied by scientists. Applied effectively, it induces the
crystallization of calcium and magnesium salts, and prevents them from scaling
or fouling. It is game-changing because it softens water without the discharge
of brine solution or salt, and has unlimited capacity. 


The Akwamag
was developed from a deep understanding of magnetohydrodynamics (the
interaction between magnets and moving water). Our proprietary High Intensity
Multipass™ magnetic technology converts dissolved lime-scale into a structure
that is easily and safely removed from your water fixtures.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I wanted to do something to raise awareness for Earth Day, improve the environtment, and raise some funds as well. So, together we can  contribute to the Nature Conservancey to raise funds for their Plant a Billion Trees program to restore the Brazilian Atlantic Rain forest and you can have a reward for helping ! </p>
<p>I have fond memories of trees as a child. While my grandparents lived in the city, I often helped my Grandfather in his garden. It was hard work pulling weeds and I did not always enjoy it, but I learned many life lessons during that time with my Grandfather.</p>
<p>One summer, I was eating a peach and I wondered out loud if this peach seed would grow if we planted it. My grandfather and I went out to the side yard and planted the peach seed together that same day.</p>
<p>I moved away for several years and returned to visit and noticed a new tree in the yard. I had forgotten about the peach tree. My Grandmother told me it was the peach tree that Pop and I had planted years ago. And that he had diligently cared for the tree to ensure it's growth. </p>
<p>Today, as a Father, I often remind my kids that it is my job to help them grow tall, strong, and straight like a tree trunk as my grandparents did for me.</p>
<p>If you have a fondness for trees, family, and mother earth as I do; choose your level of support and together we will plant many trees this Earth Day and celebrate the global human family.</p>

What type of media are you going to evaluate?We will start by evaluating the most influential news organizations focusing on climate change. As we scale up this project, we are open to analyzing any type of information on the internet, including popular blog posts and political speeches.8. With that many articles every day on climate, how are you going to evaluate them all?We won’t. But we want to be in a position to evaluate any influential article on climate change. And by aggregating our evaluations into a Trust Tracker, you’ll already know which media outlets are likely to publish information you can trust.9. How did Climate Feedback start?As scientists, we came up with Climate Feedback after seeing that our friends and colleagues were genuinely confused by contradictory stories on climate change. We found many scientists who shared our frustration after reading articles that were inconsistent with current scientific knowledge. We decided to take it into our own hands to help readers find the most trustworthy information.",13.0,0,"1 Campaign

Mari mari pu peñi, pu lamngen ka kom pu che:
On May 29th and 30th, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights will meet in San José, Costa Rica, to hear and rule on a case presented by the families of Mapuche political prisoners from Chile. This case is based on the severe psychological and social damage and the traumatic effects that their imprisonment has had on Mapuche families, communities, elders, adults, and children in recent years as the result of state repression in southern Chile.
The presence of all Mapuche petitioners and the participation of a Machi—a Mapuche spiritual and medicinal authority—are essential for the success of this petition. The Mapuche petitioners have suffered from state repression that has affected their families, their communities, and themselves in recent years. They have also experienced precarious economic conditions as a the result of the social, economic, and cultural marginalization of Mapuche communities by centuries of colonialism and discrimination within Chilean history. Therefore, solidarity and support from the international community is vital. 
The petitioners would like to make possible the presence of a Machi through this fundraising campaign. The Machi is a Mapuche authority who attends the collective health of communities and establishes symbolic, ritual, and physical communication with the land, the spirits, and the community, all of which are fundamental parts of the Mapuche Being (Mapuche Ngen). Therefore, a Machi presence in Costa Rica will strengthen the claim of the Mapuche petitioners. 
 If you are able to contribute to this endeavor, please make your deposit before May 16, 2013. All the collected funds will be invested in supporting the attendance of a Machi to this important meeting and the basic expenses of the Mapuche petitioners during the hearings at the Inter-American Court. Any remaining funds from this campaign will be saved for other upcoming Mapuche cases that will be brought to international courts.
 This fundraising campaign is mainly designed  to cover the travel expenses of a Machi for the Inter-American Court meeting in San José, Costa Rica. We are receiving donations through the institutional website of The Center for Justice and International Law (CEJIL), based in Washington, D.C. By contributing a minimun of $20 you can support this great cause, please insert the word “MAPUCHE” in the box for Comments, which will allow us to keep track of the funds raised.

Case Background 
This case is presented before the Inter-American Court by the Center for Justice and International Law (CEJIL), based in Washington D.C., and the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), based in Europe.
On August 12, 2011, the Inter-American Court on Human Rights decided to give full consideration to this case on behalf of Mapuche community leaders and activists Pascual Pichun—who recently passed away—, Segundo Aniceto Norin, Jaime Marileo, José Huenchunao, Juan Marileo, Juan Millacheo, Victor Ancalaf, and Chilean supporter of the Mapuche cause, Patricia Troncoso. The litigation intends to challenge the “judicial” processes staged in Chile and to expose the traumatic effects of repressive state policies that have increasingly aggravated the issue of Indigenous rights in the country and that have harmed Mapuche families, and communities. 
This claim against the Chilean State at the Inter-American Court constitutes a collective and urgent effort from several families and relatives of Mapuche activists in prison. In recent years, Mapuche people have experienced grave violations to their spiritual, physical, familiar and social integrity of their homes, communities, and loved ones. This is part of a long colonial history of discrimination, racism and state violence against Indigenous peoples in Chile and throughout Latin America. The appeal to an international institution emerges as the result of the unjust incarceration and harassment by state police to activists and leaders from communities who have stood up for their land rights and the recovery of communal territories in southern Chile.
I respectfully urge you to support this fundraising campaign by contributing a minimum of $20 for the travel expenses of a Machi for the Inter-American Court meeting in San José, Costa Rica. 
Your individual or group support can contribute to creating a global environment in which human rights and indigenous rights are respected.
Truly yours,

<p><b>Los Cedros Biological Reserve consists of 17,000 acres of premontane wet tropical and cloud forest in Northwestern Ecuador.</b>  Of this, 2,650 acres is formerly colonized (now reforested) land, while the remainder is <b>primary forest</b>. The reserve is a southern buffer zone for the 450,000 acre Cotocachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve and both are part of the Choco Phytogeographical Zone. <b>The Choco region is perhaps the most biologically diverse and endemic habitat on Earth. </b>Researchers are still finding new and undescribed species yearly in Los Cedros – most recently a new species of frog discovered in the reserve named Pristimantis Mutabilis which is the first reptile which can change the texture of its skin back and forth from all warts to slippery smooth in minutes. A new phenomenon to science.</p>
<p><b>A dedicated group of forest activists, lead by reserve creator Jose DeCoux, has managed and protected the LCBR for the last 26 years and counting. </b> This biodiversity gem would have long ago succumbed to deforestation, pastures, cows and corn if it weren't for the continued presence of this team. The constant search for new arable land for subsistence agriculture and illegal logging would have turned this rich and magical forest ecosystem to a simple pasture.</p>

<p>Encompassing thousands of species, the invertebrates dominate the faunal biomass. <b>In Los Cedros there are over 900 species of nocturnal moths</b> most with amazing wing patterns and colours. There are also thousands of species of butterflies, ants, beetles, spiders, and bees. Often seen is the Pepsis Wasp (Hercules Wasp), and it may be dragging a tarantula home to serve as a living nest for its young. The largest cockroach in the world lives here, along with the first aquatic cockroach found in South America .

<p>Evidence in the form of scat, tracks, cameras and the occasional sighting provide the assurance that five species of felines roam their territories here in the reserve. Common names are the Jaguarundi, Margay, Oncilla, Puma, and Jaguar. In the morning, along with the chorus of birds, you are likely to be woken by the Mantled Howler Monkey. He is the loudest, so can often be heard, and sometimes seen, in the canopy. The two other primates are the White-Throated Capuchins and the rare Brown-Headed Spider Monkey. The only species of South American bear, the Spectacled Bear, inhabits the higher elevations of the reserve and is seen on occasion. Other mammals include the Opossum, Nine-Banded Armadillo, Kinkajou, Tayra, Southern River Otter, Collared Peccary, Red Brocket Deer, Paca, Agouti, Spiny Pocket Mouse, Bicolo-Spined Porcupine, Western Dwarf Squirrel, and Red-Tailed Squirrel.</p>

<p>Abundant tree species include Copal, Madrono, Avocatillo, Strangler Fig and Podocarpus and the Cedars that give the reserve its name.  Fifty more tree species  have been identified, but this represents only a small fraction of the diversity present in the area. The dense forest floor and understory is a thick web of buttress roots, lianas, vines, prop roots, drop roots, and decomposing plant material. Characteristic of a cloud forest, the trees on the ridge lines are more stunted in size and laden with masses of luxuriant ephiphytes, with a more open canopy allowing a thicker and richer understory.</p>

<h3 style=""letter-spacing: normal;"">What We Need <br/>
</h3>
<p style=""letter-spacing: normal;""></p>
<p>We need to raise $12,000 immediately to be able to re-survey the boundaries of the reserve and for our staff to have the living expenses to be able to travel to Ibarra and Quito to meet with government officials to advocate for the integrity of the reserve.  </p>
<p>Patrol must be hired to assist the community members who watch the trails for illegal logging and hunting. </p>
<p>We also need to maintain all that we have built to house volunteers, researchers and tourists that are the backbone of the monthly support for the reserve’s management. </p>
<p>These are the kinds of expenses that are incredibly hard to raise for a small, grassroots NGO.  This campaign can make a huge difference in the future of neotropical biodiversity conservation.</p>

<p>(Versión

affects the environment, the lives of animals and our own. But in most parts of
the world there is a lack of information on the levels of pollution and
consumption of water that the cattle industry generates. Colombia is one of the
six countries in the world with most water resources but there is a lack of
research in the country in this field.  <br/></p>
<p>That’s why I want to do my dissertation research on the impact that cattle industry has on water and the way economy affects this impact. I find that the MSc in Holistic Science at
Schumacher College offers me the integration of diverse elements to understand
a complex phenomenon like the relation between water and animals in a holistic way.</p>
<p>My aim is that this research will contribute to gathering the information

<p>Education has been one of the main ways; not only from an institutional
approach but also  through building up grassroots movements: youth, non-violence,
bicycle, animal rights, trees, water and environmental issues in general. On behalf
the Federación de Liberación Animal (Federation of Animal Freedom) , I run the
only school in Colombia for animal rights activist, that has an ecological
approach. Independent media is another of the ways I am raising awareness about
our relationships with the environment and animals. I have coordinated a radio

<br/></div>","WATER, A
RIGHT WE ALL HAVE 
(Versión
en español abajo)I feel we have the right to make informed decisions, particularly when this
affects the environment, the lives of animals and our own. But in most parts of
the world there is a lack of information on the levels of pollution and
consumption of water that the cattle industry generates. Colombia is one of the
six countries in the world with most water resources but there is a lack of
research in the country in this field.  
That’s why I want to do my dissertation research on the impact that cattle industry has on water and the way economy affects this impact. I find that the MSc in Holistic Science at
Schumacher College offers me the integration of diverse elements to understand
a complex phenomenon like the relation between water and animals in a holistic way.
My aim is that this research will contribute to gathering the information
we need in order to take correct actions in what concerns the protection of
water and animals; that will contribute to generating transformative
educational exercises on the relationship we establish with water and animals;
and that it will support the transition to the understanding of water as a
fundamental right. Water is essential to all living beings; well cared water is not only a human right; it’s a right of nature as well.

<p>The
SEDNA expedition is named for the Inuit goddess of the sea and with all the
rapid changes taking place, the Arctic Ocean may need her protection. In just the last few years it has become possible for commercial vessels
to navigate  the Northwest Passage. Shipping traffic increased from
9 ships in 2007 to 30 in 2012, and is expected to triple by 2040. As a land use planner and an environmental conservationist, the question that came
to my mind was ""are we ready for this""?</p>
<p>The Arctic Ocean is such an inaccessible region due to logistical
challenges, extreme weather conditions, and the high costs of conducting field
research, investigators actually know very little about the biodiversity and
habitat of this Arctic marine environment. The SEDNA Expedition will gather
crucial data and help inform future decisions about habitat use, change, and
appropriate uses for other human activities. The resulting TV documentaries
will share these results with the public.</p>
<p>The SEDNA team includes filmmakers,
educators and marine scientists. I have participated as field scientist on five
ocean science research expeditions throughout the Pacific Ocean and would like to offer to the
rest of the world a window to the Arctic snorkel zone, a dynamic
land-sea-air-ice-interface. To this end, I will have to face the challenge of
the unforgiving and unpredictable arctic seas by snorkeling the Northwest Passage
in 2016: 3,000km in 3 months! </p>
<p>But
first, I have to fund my share of the costs - $18,000 - in time for the Sedna
Proof-of-Concept Expedition from July 13-27, 2014 where we will test the
concept and ourselves. These funds will pay for my place on the vessel and my
transport fees. I need your help to get there! </p>
<p>This

<p>Your

</tbody></table><p><b><i>Petite histoire</i></b> — Septembre 2013 : je reçois un
appel de Susan R. Eaton, géophysicienne et plongeuse spécialisée en
conservation. Elle me demande si je suis intéressée à faire partie d’une équipe
de 10 femmes pour parcourir en plongée libre à relais la totalité du passage du
Nord-Ouest dans l’Arctique. L’équipe SEDNA comprend des cinéastes, des
éducatrices et des scientifiques. Tout de suite j’ai accepté. La nature me
fascine depuis toujours. J’aime la sonder en dépit parfois des conditions
difficiles qu’il faut affronter pour cela. Au cours des dernières années, j’ai
pris part à cinq missions océanographiques dans le Pacifique à titre de
scientifique de terrain.</p>
<p><b><i>Sedna, déesse inuite</i></b>—L’expédition emprunte son nom à la
déesse inuite de la mer, Sedna. Nous croyons en effet que l’océan Arctique a
besoin de sa protection! Depuis quelques années, le passage du Nord-Ouest est
accessible à la navigation commerciale. Entre 2007 et 2012 déjà, le trafic
annuel est passé de 9 à 30 navires et en 2040 ce trafic aura triplé. Aussi,
pour l’aménagiste du territoire que je suis, la question se pose :
sommes-nous prêts?</p>
<p><b><i>Connaissance et sensibilisation </i></b>— L’océan Arctique est difficile
d’accès. Son étude nécessite une logistique considérable, les conditions
climatiques y sont extrêmes, les relevés sur le terrain coûtent très cher.
Aussi connaissons-nous encore très peu cette région du point de vue notamment
de sa biodiversité. L’expédition SEDNA permettra de recueillir des données indispensables
aux décisions qui seront prises pour utiliser de façon planifiée et
responsable ce territoire. Volet sensibilisation : l’émission télévisée
que nous réaliserons va permettre de partager nos découvertes dans les écoles
et avec le grand public. </p>
<p><b><i>La zone d’intérêt</i></b> — Pour moi, cette expédition est l’occasion
d’offrir au monde une fenêtre sur ce que nous appelons la <i>snorkel zone</i>, cette interface dynamique où la mer, la terre, l’air
et la glace se rejoignent. Pour ce faire, il me faut, avec mes partenaires, oser
l’Arctique dans ce qu’il a d’imprévisible et d’exigeant : parcourir en
plongée libre le passage du Nord-Ouest, soit 3000 kilomètres en 3 mois.</p>
<p><b><i>Préexpédition</i></b> — Une préexpédition est nécessaire pour
tester le concept. Nous la ferons du 13 au 27 juillet 2014. En plongée libre,
nous irons du Labrador au Groenland en passant par l’île de Baffin. </p>
<p><b><i>Votre aide</i></b> — Mais mon premier défi est de trouver
du financement dans le délai fixé. 18 000 $ sont nécessaires pour
couvrir mon transport et ma place à bord du navire. Cette somme doit être
amassée avant la préexpédition de juillet prochain. La réalisation du projet
est impossible sans vos dons et je sollicite donc instamment votre aide. Toutes
les contributions sont bienvenues. Passez le mot au plus grand nombre de
personnes possibles, de vive voix, par courriel ou par les réseaux sociaux, afin
que je réussisse ma campagne de financement. J’espère aussi que vous suivrez
l’expédition Sedna sur ma page Facebook (facebook.com/francoise.gervais.50).</p>
<p>J’ai confiance qu’en menant à bien
cette expédition, on accomplira quelque chose d’important pour la science, la
culture et l’éducation.</p>
<p>Merci de croire au projet.</p>
<p>Merci à l’avance de votre
contribution.</p>

Le passage du Nord-Ouest en plongée libre relais 




Projet 


En relais à la nage avec masque
  et snorkel, 10 femmes vont parcourir le passage arctique du Nord-Ouest




Nom 


Sedna Expedition





But 


Recueillir des données
  essentielles relatives à ce milieu marin peu fréquenté jusqu’ici, aider la
  communauté scientifique à mieux connaître ces écosystèmes, faire prendre
  conscience de leur fragilité





Année 


2016


Petite histoire — Septembre 2013 : je reçois un
appel de Susan R. Eaton, géophysicienne et plongeuse spécialisée en
conservation. Elle me demande si je suis intéressée à faire partie d’une équipe
de 10 femmes pour parcourir en plongée libre à relais la totalité du passage du
Nord-Ouest dans l’Arctique. L’équipe SEDNA comprend des cinéastes, des
éducatrices et des scientifiques. Tout de suite j’ai accepté. La nature me
fascine depuis toujours. J’aime la sonder en dépit parfois des conditions
difficiles qu’il faut affronter pour cela. Au cours des dernières années, j’ai
pris part à cinq missions océanographiques dans le Pacifique à titre de
scientifique de terrain.
Sedna, déesse inuite—L’expédition emprunte son nom à la
déesse inuite de la mer, Sedna. Nous croyons en effet que l’océan Arctique a
besoin de sa protection! Depuis quelques années, le passage du Nord-Ouest est
accessible à la navigation commerciale. Entre 2007 et 2012 déjà, le trafic
annuel est passé de 9 à 30 navires et en 2040 ce trafic aura triplé. Aussi,
pour l’aménagiste du territoire que je suis, la question se pose :
sommes-nous prêts?
Connaissance et sensibilisation — L’océan Arctique est difficile
d’accès. Son étude nécessite une logistique considérable, les conditions
climatiques y sont extrêmes, les relevés sur le terrain coûtent très cher.
Aussi connaissons-nous encore très peu cette région du point de vue notamment
de sa biodiversité. L’expédition SEDNA permettra de recueillir des données indispensables
aux décisions qui seront prises pour utiliser de façon planifiée et
responsable ce territoire. Volet sensibilisation : l’émission télévisée
que nous réaliserons va permettre de partager nos découvertes dans les écoles
et avec le grand public. 
La zone d’intérêt — Pour moi, cette expédition est l’occasion
d’offrir au monde une fenêtre sur ce que nous appelons la snorkel zone, cette interface dynamique où la mer, la terre, l’air
et la glace se rejoignent. Pour ce faire, il me faut, avec mes partenaires, oser
l’Arctique dans ce qu’il a d’imprévisible et d’exigeant : parcourir en
plongée libre le passage du Nord-Ouest, soit 3000 kilomètres en 3 mois.
Préexpédition — Une préexpédition est nécessaire pour
tester le concept. Nous la ferons du 13 au 27 juillet 2014. En plongée libre,
nous irons du Labrador au Groenland en passant par l’île de Baffin. 
Votre aide — Mais mon premier défi est de trouver
du financement dans le délai fixé. 18 000 $ sont nécessaires pour
couvrir mon transport et ma place à bord du navire. Cette somme doit être
amassée avant la préexpédition de juillet prochain. La réalisation du projet
est impossible sans vos dons et je sollicite donc instamment votre aide. Toutes
les contributions sont bienvenues. Passez le mot au plus grand nombre de
personnes possibles, de vive voix, par courriel ou par les réseaux sociaux, afin
que je réussisse ma campagne de financement. J’espère aussi que vous suivrez
l’expédition Sedna sur ma page Facebook (facebook.com/francoise.gervais.50).
J’ai confiance qu’en menant à bien
cette expédition, on accomplira quelque chose d’important pour la science, la
culture et l’éducation.
Merci de croire au projet.
Merci à l’avance de votre
contribution.

<span>
Bring people of all nations together
face-to-face in actual physical contact to do sacred ceremony together in the
ancient language - on the land, for the land and for the people - to
acknowledge our shared values and wisdom as human beings. Today,
cross-cultural, cross-spiritual, trusting relationships are essential to
retrieve and reinforce the ‘original’ wisdom carried down through the ages by
indigenous cultures.</span>

<div>
<p><span><span>Starting 8/27/14, Ojibwa, Maori and Sufi Medicine Men and
Women will travel in New Zealand doing ceremonies for the earth with Maori
Healers and Wisdom Keepers on their Marae (Sacred Space). Then on 9/9/14 all will go to
Arizona and New Mexico to do ceremonies with Havasupai, Hopi, Apache, Yaqui,
Polynesian and Navaho Wisdom Keepers and Healers. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The group will fly to New York
City, where two of the participants have delegate seats at the United Nations
World Conference on Indigenous Peoples. A final event will be held in NYC.<span><br/></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Jane Feldman (award-winning photojournalist who has

My name is David Harris, owner of Associated Island
     Developers, Ltd.  We are a small
     development company that is dedicated to sustainable living and marine
     research.  We are purchasing an
     island in the beautiful waters of Exuma, Bahamas and developing a small
     sustainable vacation destination that focuses on the oceanic beauty only
     found in the Exumas.

The mission for education on the island is: To create a
     marine sanctuary with the smallest human footprint and the largest ocean
     impact through engaged learning experiences in marine research, data
     collection, observation, and creation of self-contained ecosystems.
The education site will house a classroom, research
     lab, public display gallery, aquariums, and library.  The classroom will be used for seminars,
     classes, conferences, and meetings. 
     The research lab will hold scientific instruments, such as water
     quality testing, microscopes, attachable cameras, video and digital still
     cameras, logbooks, measuring devices, collection equipment, and computers.  Aquariums will be contained within the
     public display gallery and maintained by students / researchers on
     site.  It may be necessary to also
     place species / research specific aquariums within both classroom and
     lab.  A library of current
     oceanographic materials pertaining to southern Atlantic species and issues
     will be designed by use for education and island residents.

The ocean environment is the foundation for life on
     Earth.  It is a critical resource
     for land and water plants, and animals. 
     Human impact places ever-increasing dangers and threats upon this
     delicate ecological reserve.

     their toll.  We must practice
     preservation if man and water are to survive on this Earth as co-inhabitants.  Humans must understand the ocean as a
     living, breathing, life force that is truly the base for survival.  Conservation starts today, and it

<h3>Bref résumé</h3>
<div>Mon nom est Tulasi Lessard et je suis une des citoyennes de Sutton qui a reçu la lettre d'HQ datée du 28 mai 2014, nous avertissant de leur projet d'installation massive des compteurs ""intelligents"" dans la ville. </div>
<div>La coalition que nous avons formé trouve que cette lettre ne laisse pas de réel choix au consommateur et que beaucoup d'information supplémentaire devrait être partagée avec tous les citoyens: dont les nombreux inconvénients déjà observés liés à ces nouveaux compteurs, ainsi que les actions que nous pouvons poser si nous ne voulons pas de ce compteur sur notre demeure.</div>
<div>Pour ce faire, la coalition veut faire parvenir un feuillet informatif à toutes les adresses postales de Sutton pour s'assurer que chaque citoyen y aura accès. Cela engendre des coûts minimum d'environs 500$, d'où notre motivation de faire cette levée de fond. Si il y a des excédents, ils seront utilisés pour le financement d'avocats, pour un recours collectif, rassemblant tous les intéressés à Sutton.</div>
</div><div>Ce projet favorise une approche de précaution envers la technologie ""Wi"", pour le bien-être de toute les générations et surtout de nos enfants.</div><div>Il est temps que chaque citoyen fasse entendre son opinion.</div><div>En attendant, un site internet qui donne déjà beaucoup d'info:</div><div>refusonslescompteurs.wordpress.com</div><div>

</div></div>","Bref résumé
Mon nom est Tulasi Lessard et je suis une des citoyennes de Sutton qui a reçu la lettre d'HQ datée du 28 mai 2014, nous avertissant de leur projet d'installation massive des compteurs ""intelligents"" dans la ville. 
La coalition que nous avons formé trouve que cette lettre ne laisse pas de réel choix au consommateur et que beaucoup d'information supplémentaire devrait être partagée avec tous les citoyens: dont les nombreux inconvénients déjà observés liés à ces nouveaux compteurs, ainsi que les actions que nous pouvons poser si nous ne voulons pas de ce compteur sur notre demeure.
Pour ce faire, la coalition veut faire parvenir un feuillet informatif à toutes les adresses postales de Sutton pour s'assurer que chaque citoyen y aura accès. Cela engendre des coûts minimum d'environs 500$, d'où notre motivation de faire cette levée de fond. Si il y a des excédents, ils seront utilisés pour le financement d'avocats, pour un recours collectif, rassemblant tous les intéressés à Sutton.
Ce projet favorise une approche de précaution envers la technologie ""Wi"", pour le bien-être de toute les générations et surtout de nos enfants.Il est temps que chaque citoyen fasse entendre son opinion.En attendant, un site internet qui donne déjà beaucoup d'info:refusonslescompteurs.wordpress.com
D'autres façons d'aider?
Prière de passer le mot et de faire la même démarche dans votre ville!!
Merci de contribuer à ce mouvement collectif pour la défense de nos droits de consommateurs.

<p>I am
Andrew Mupuya 5 year’s back, when my parents had lost
their jobs and could only afford my school fees. I had to get to meet my basic
needs by myself, I decided to face the world alone. After participating in the
Junior Achievement company program at my school( Kololo sss).</p>
<p>By that
time the government of Uganda announced that they were considering a ban on plastic
bags to curb environmental damage. I immediately saw this as an opportunity to start
a paper bag production company.</p>
<p>I
conducted a feasibility study, market research around retail shops, kiosks,
supermarkets around Kampala and discovered there is need and potential market
for paper bags</p>
<p>To start I needed a
capital of 36,000 Ugandan shillings ($14). I collected used plastic bottles and
I was able to raise the first $11 then I borrowed the remaining $3 from my
teacher and I started producing paper bags on a small scale.</p><p></p><p>Eco friendly paper bags campaign is aimed at sharing the pressing
Environmental damage with YOU, currently Environmental pollution is high and
has caused negative impact to the Globe, this initiative was started when Kampala
a capital city of Uganda was polluted in form of air pollution when plastic
bags are used, dumped and burnt, inform of water pollution like plastic bags
blocking water streams leading to flooding and breeding grounds for disease
vectors like Mosquitoes, like in 2000 there was an outbreak of cholera in
Kampala. Land pollution where in areas where they have been deposited in large
quantities, soil fertility has been lost. The polythene bags have also got acidic
combination which with time disturbs the chemical formulas of the soils, this
has affected the country’s Gross domestic product because 60% of Uganda’s
economy is contributed by agriculture.<br/>
Plastics bags are also poisonous when they are burnt below 800 o Celsius. In
slums Used </p>
<p>Plastic bags are at times re-used as mobile toilets and thrown on the
ways in that when it’s re-used again it’s very dangerous to human health.  </p>
<p>A combination of released gases both at production of
plastic bags and after usage is a great contribution to global warming.</p>
<p><b>Why paper bags?</b></p>
<p><b>Paper bags</b> come from agricultural materials,
which grow in the earth's soil. The materials needed to make <b>paper bags </b>are considered renewable resources
that are controlled. Once paper is made, It can be recycled and used to create
more paper goods. Bags made from paper are bio-degradable and hence highly
environment friendly than plastic bags, which pose a threat to the environment.
<span>Paper bags decompose compared to polythene that
take 15 to 1000 years to break down,Can
be recycled to make new paper,require
less energy than plastic to be recycled hence low cost<span>, they also pose less of a threat to both
domestic and wildlife than plastic.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Impact Created</span></span></p><p><span><span>Currently the project have created both direct and indirect impact in different ways by employing people up to 21 people are employed directly and we have supplied over 6 million paper bags to the community.<br/></span></span></p><br/><p></p>
<p>                               </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p></p><p>Your great offer will help us build the production plant
that will enable us produce, train and sensitize the community about
environmental conservation, supply and distribute. We need to acquire paper
bags production machinery that cost $150,000 USD F.O.B price in China or Germany, this machines are not made in Africa and this will be the first paper bag making machine in Uganda. it will enable us achieve the goal to supply the
required quantities.</p>
<p>Your contribution will save the world from a high effect of
cancer and air born diseases out of pollution caused by polythene bags, through
application of technology and mechanization of the project that will lead to
steeped and mass production of the eco-friendly paper bags. And this will lead
to replacing and reducing the use of polythene and plastic bags.</p><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p></p><p>We need $200,000 USD to help us import paper bag making
machinery and set up premises to help manufacture and recycling of paper. <br/></p><p></p><p>This will create employment opportunities to communities, this machine will provide job opportunities to over 60 individuals. <br/></p><p>Increase on

We serve up a selection of delicious vegan salads, always packed full of colourful vegetables and proteins - always fresh and gluten free.

We use produce grown right here in Vancouver's urban farms, and strive to be as sustainable as possible, using organic produce and only 100% compostable packaging.

Our aim is to make healthy clean eating as effortless as possible for you!
But did you know that most food trucks run on gas powered generators?

Our goal for this project is to convert the our salad truck to a completely sustainable model. We will install energy efficient fridges that use 1/20th the energy of our existing fridges. We’ll install solar panels on the roof and replace our batteries with clean ones.
With these upgrades we’ll finally be free of our gas generator.Who we are
We are Christina Culver, Sarah Culver, and Jesse Savath, friends, family, and business partners who share a love of healthy food and sustainability.

<ul>
<li>Create and promote <strong>real sustainable techniques</strong> and put them within the grasp of anyone.</li>
<li>Cultivate a <strong>culture of respect and love for the Earth</strong>, naturally attracting sustainable actions.</li>
<li>Help to<strong> free human beings</strong> from endless acquisition of material or work to<strong> fill a financial void</strong>.</li>
<li>Increase <strong>meaningful quality of life</strong> by bringing people <strong>closer to nature</strong> and the means of their living.</li>
<li>
<strong>Learn from nature itself</strong> more and more means to adapt our technology to its tried-and-true methods.</li>
<li>Work with local organizations and schools to <strong>teach the next generation</strong>.</li>
<li>Create real living community of families living in proximity, sharing meals and a real hearth-and-home culture.</li>
<li>
<strong>Re-establish real family values</strong> that involve the next generation with  home and work life.</li>
<li>Create a <strong>virtual nexus</strong> of information to spread through social media, applications, and other web presence.</li>
<li>Provide a complete quality <strong>organic local diet</strong> to people in the area.</li>
<li>Provide ample<strong> power </strong>to all on-site residents and extra power to community.</li>
<li>Cultivate an <strong>organic heirloom seed reserve</strong> in GMO-safe green domes.</li>
<li>Provide easy <strong>open-source instruction manuals</strong> and designs to create sustainable technologies everywhere.</li>
<li>Funnel profits garnered from excess power production and local food markets into <strong>grants and related projects</strong>.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<br/><h3>$180,000 is a lot of money. Why do you need that much?</h3>
<p>We have priced the goal of this campaign to match the mean price of a <strong>normal 3-bedroom home</strong> in this area that a family might move into. We are trying to show that the <strong>same financial investment</strong> could go to creating an <strong>all-encompassing renewable foundation</strong> with a capacity for <strong>endless growth</strong>.  By crowdfunding the entire effort we hope to <strong>mobilize immediately</strong> and soon <strong>create enough abundance</strong> that we can <strong>grant funding</strong> to similar projects and invest in community mutual funds to <strong>create green infrastructure</strong> and businesses.  By creating a local example that renewable enterprise <strong>can be financially profitable</strong> we hope to encourage banks to lend out capital to sustainable projects. If the grant system and mutual funds grow in popularity and strength it could eventually <strong>create natural competition for traditional mortgages</strong> and force banks to <strong>lower interest rates</strong>, which would help the middle class and slow the rapid upward redistribution of the nation's wealth. In other words, by helping <strong>fund this amount now</strong> you can <strong>make it easier</strong> for these kinds of projects to <strong>get funded in the future</strong>.</p>
<br/><h3>Why this? Why Now?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Global warming isn't cooling down </strong>and practically every expert with an opinion on the matter thinks we haven't yet seen the <strong>full wrath</strong> that a modified climate can unleash<strong>. </strong>The plain truth  is that <strong>clean energy technologies</strong> need to be adopted <em>en masse</em> <strong>yesterday.</strong>
</li>
<li>
<b>The global food system is making the planet and all its people sick. </b>Local food systems providing healthy products to communities and protecting ecosystems rapidly need to become mainstream before they are snuffed out by gigantic agribusiness seeking to control all food.</li>
<li>
<strong>Plastic</strong>, mostly used for packaging that will only touch human hands for about 10 seconds, is <a href=""https://www.recyclebank.com/live-green/fish-eat-ocean-gyre-plastic-that-means-were-eating-plastic-too"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">choking the life out of sea animals</a> and saturating the food chain of the planet. There are grassroots organizations finding <a href=""http://plasticbank.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">creative ways to something about this</a>, with great success, but we need to create a local food and technology culture that reduces the demand for this waseful material to even exist.</li>
<li>
<strong>The moment is now</strong>, the need has never been higher, and the <strong>iron is hot.</strong> There is a massive undercurrent sweeping all generations and sustainability is the buzzword for a generation that is rapidly mobilizing. Green projects are making newspaper headlines all over the world. Any kind of investment into this sort of a project right now is a good idea in the short and long run.</li>
<li>
<strong>The principle of land ownership by people  is at risk.</strong> With recent redistribution of wealth upward and massive acquisition of property by banks which are in a <strong>lending ice age</strong>, the costs and challenges of owning land are becoming too great for many to handle. <strong>Private land ownership </strong>is essential for causes like <strong>forest and water management</strong> and for projects like this to exist. <img align=""right"" alt=""Endangered Species Everywhere Need Your Help"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://geekscheaper.com/earthstarenterprises/images/newt.jpg"" src="""" style=""padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;""/>Creative solutions are needed for creating <strong>funding mechanisms</strong> for <strong>responsible land stewardship</strong> which will be unlikely if land is in the hands of corporations.</li>
<li>
<strong>Thousands of species are going extinct and habitats are disappearing</strong>, many in peoples' own backyards, without their even knowing. Educating the next generation on the importance of healthy, diverse ecosystems is the greatest hope to protecting them and the fragile balance they maintain.</li>
<li>
<strong>There is no greater cause</strong>, and no more exciting <strong>opportunity</strong>, than designing our civilization to last.</li>
</ul>
<br/><h3>If We Don't Get All Our Funding</h3>
<p>This won't stop us. There are lots of people willing to allow the use of their land through donation, lease, or lease-to-own. If we are unable to get land of our own right away we already have connections to groups and farms that are doing this work.  We would then re-configure the campaign and continuing to expand the social networks before running it again. </p>
<p>Much of the renewable energy tech and buildings will be <strong>mobile</strong> meaning it won't be a permanent fixture and we can move it easily to another property when we get it. As much money as possible will be going into solar and other sustainable energy. We will still be able, just with what I put in myself over the course of the campaign, to purchase a yurt. I already have enough staple and fresh produce seeds to start a small farm as it is, so that aspect is covered. My apartment lease is up October 31st so one way or another, this is the lifestyle we will be moving into this November.<br/></p>

Our Goals

Create and promote real sustainable techniques and put them within the grasp of anyone.
Cultivate a culture of respect and love for the Earth, naturally attracting sustainable actions.
Help to free human beings from endless acquisition of material or work to fill a financial void.
Increase meaningful quality of life by bringing people closer to nature and the means of their living.

Learn from nature itself more and more means to adapt our technology to its tried-and-true methods.
Work with local organizations and schools to teach the next generation.
Create real living community of families living in proximity, sharing meals and a real hearth-and-home culture.

Re-establish real family values that involve the next generation with  home and work life.
Create a virtual nexus of information to spread through social media, applications, and other web presence.
Provide a complete quality organic local diet to people in the area.
Provide ample power to all on-site residents and extra power to community.
Cultivate an organic heirloom seed reserve in GMO-safe green domes.
Provide easy open-source instruction manuals and designs to create sustainable technologies everywhere.
Funnel profits garnered from excess power production and local food markets into grants and related projects.


$180,000 is a lot of money. Why do you need that much?
We have priced the goal of this campaign to match the mean price of a normal 3-bedroom home in this area that a family might move into. We are trying to show that the same financial investment could go to creating an all-encompassing renewable foundation with a capacity for endless growth.  By crowdfunding the entire effort we hope to mobilize immediately and soon create enough abundance that we can grant funding to similar projects and invest in community mutual funds to create green infrastructure and businesses.  By creating a local example that renewable enterprise can be financially profitable we hope to encourage banks to lend out capital to sustainable projects. If the grant system and mutual funds grow in popularity and strength it could eventually create natural competition for traditional mortgages and force banks to lower interest rates, which would help the middle class and slow the rapid upward redistribution of the nation's wealth. In other words, by helping fund this amount now you can make it easier for these kinds of projects to get funded in the future.
Why this? Why Now?


Global warming isn't cooling down and practically every expert with an opinion on the matter thinks we haven't yet seen the full wrath that a modified climate can unleash. The plain truth  is that clean energy technologies need to be adopted en masse yesterday.


The global food system is making the planet and all its people sick. Local food systems providing healthy products to communities and protecting ecosystems rapidly need to become mainstream before they are snuffed out by gigantic agribusiness seeking to control all food.

Plastic, mostly used for packaging that will only touch human hands for about 10 seconds, is choking the life out of sea animals and saturating the food chain of the planet. There are grassroots organizations finding creative ways to something about this, with great success, but we need to create a local food and technology culture that reduces the demand for this waseful material to even exist.

The moment is now, the need has never been higher, and the iron is hot. There is a massive undercurrent sweeping all generations and sustainability is the buzzword for a generation that is rapidly mobilizing. Green projects are making newspaper headlines all over the world. Any kind of investment into this sort of a project right now is a good idea in the short and long run.

The principle of land ownership by people  is at risk. With recent redistribution of wealth upward and massive acquisition of property by banks which are in a lending ice age, the costs and challenges of owning land are becoming too great for many to handle. Private land ownership is essential for causes like forest and water management and for projects like this to exist. Creative solutions are needed for creating funding mechanisms for responsible land stewardship which will be unlikely if land is in the hands of corporations.

Thousands of species are going extinct and habitats are disappearing, many in peoples' own backyards, without their even knowing. Educating the next generation on the importance of healthy, diverse ecosystems is the greatest hope to protecting them and the fragile balance they maintain.

There is no greater cause, and no more exciting opportunity, than designing our civilization to last.

If We Don't Get All Our Funding
This won't stop us. There are lots of people willing to allow the use of their land through donation, lease, or lease-to-own. If we are unable to get land of our own right away we already have connections to groups and farms that are doing this work.  We would then re-configure the campaign and continuing to expand the social networks before running it again. 
Much of the renewable energy tech and buildings will be mobile meaning it won't be a permanent fixture and we can move it easily to another property when we get it. As much money as possible will be going into solar and other sustainable energy. We will still be able, just with what I put in myself over the course of the campaign, to purchase a yurt. I already have enough staple and fresh produce seeds to start a small farm as it is, so that aspect is covered. My apartment lease is up October 31st so one way or another, this is the lifestyle we will be moving into this November.

100 trees feeds a small community of 400 for 75 plus years.

Quincy Burgess is COO of Bonsai, a company committed to solving food insecurity problems sustainably. With a Masters degrees in Plant Science from Hebrew University, he is well versed with the need for a long term solution to food secuity in East Africa. This campaign is ground breaking. For the first time, is there a staple food which can be grown from a tree. With this innovative insight, we can feed millions through creating storable products from the fruits, thereby mitigating the effects of sporadic climatic changes.

   What We Need & What You Get 
$5,000 helps plant 300 trees and feeds 1,200 people for 75 plus years. You have the option to have your trees named with you as the donor.
If we do not reach our entire goal, we will bank the funds until all the funds come In.
 

  The Impact Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know how the difference their contribution will make: 
This is the first campaign in an effort to plant 100,000 trees. In planting this amount of trees in 2 years, we will be on our way to feeding 10 million in 10 years. We have already began to implement food sustainable solutions through our two greenhouse projects at a school and orphanage. Make it real for people and build trust. 

  Risks & Challenges Thankfully, this is not the first time we have implemented such a project, so we have encountered many of the risks and challenges. 
We project based on past projects that 10% of our trees will die, hence our estimates of 300 trees and not 333. We have also partnered with local implementing partners in our growing areas, to ensure that communities take ownership of the trees and not become dependent on handouts.

This will promote culture, spirituality, and healing of our youth and elders and reclaiming our rights and title to the lands.

We are a group of people who have had the great
fortune of growing up in green surroundings. When we were kids, we used to play hide and
seek around ancient trees that inspired the stories told by our grandparents. Those stories have helped us to be more conscious about the environment, and
also to become activist in ecological conservation.We are parents now, but we have less and less space in which to tell
stories to future generations. We are drowning in an increasingly hostile,
desert environment with the threat of the reality of climate change. That
is why we have alredy recovered our first hectare
with the help of friends, family, neighbors and experts by repopulating it with native trees and by installing four permanent beehives to
pollinate the area. We have also talked to neighbors and farmers door to door,
looking for solutions to solve the problems and helping them to abandon the use of
pesticides and other poisons in favor of natural, and in many cases cheaper,
solutions. We put our commitment and free time to continue working, but we need YOUR help.

We want to reforest the world and to show with facts that,
with hard work and passion, we can do it. 
WE WANT TO BREATHE! HELP US TO BREATHE!

How we do it and what we need
Our goal is to recover
lands previously devastated by
fire or indiscriminate logging, but it is not easy or cheap to achieve our goal. This is why we need YOUR HELP
We want YOU to be part
of our project and become one of the team partners, so simply we would like to explain How We Do It in a simple and schematic way
Work process:
· 
We
look for areas of land scorched by fire or deforested
· 
We
analyze the land to nourish it and return it to its ideal state
· 
We
select the appropriate trees for the area, keeping the ""local custom""
· 
We
work the land, preventing future fires and turning it into
a reforested area 
·  We develop
awareness campaigns among local residents by providing access to sustainable
resources
· 
We
look for the ideal position for our ecological army (beehives) and settle
there our bees
And we
start again
To develop all these stages in a successful, efficient and sustainable
way, we need some resources:
· 
We need 12.000€ to recover 1 hectare of land with
products and natural fertilizers, and to pay the rent of the necessary
equipment to work the land.
· 
We need 1.800€ to get 400 trees suitable for the
area.
· 
We need 2.000€ to get 20 hives and help to
extend the pollination process.
· 
We need 5.000€ to help local neighbors and
farmers to avoid the use of pesticides and poisons that damage both flora
and fauna of the environment.· 
We need 1.566€ to
pay Indiegogo .
We do not need much, but we NEED YOU. Any help
is welcome, from 1 € you can help us to live in a more breathable world in which our
future generations can enjoy green environments. You and your
contribution are very important for us, so we want you to have the recognition you
deserve and be part of our project. This is why you can sponsor one tree or five trees that are going to take your name or the name of the person you want, so you have the opportunity to make an original gift to your loved ones. You can also sponsor a full EcoPath, or beehive.If
we don´t get all the funding, we will adapt the campaign to the funds raised .
Anyway, the next generations could breathe better thanks
to you!!

The impact
In the last decade, CO2 emissions have increased 10 gigatons, so CO2
capture is especially important in industrial environments, cities, etc… With
just 1 hectare, thousands of CO2 tons will be captured (after analyzing the land
and studying the type of tree suitable for the area, we´ll be able to extract
specific data), several hectares around it will be pollinated by the oldest
soldiers in the world, the bees. And of course, we will fight against those who
do not care about their environment and do not give it the importance it deserves
by changing their mindset about land and earth.

<p>Any
money and volunteers gathered from our modest Earth Day 2015 campaign
will go to powering our 3-pronged AME Globe campaign we are
putting together to make a measureable difference to help insure that
we kids – and our kids’ kids - enjoy a safe and wonderful future.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>AME
stands for “A Mobile Ecology”, and the Globe stands for our
beautiful Earth.</p>
<p>We
understand that most campaigns have but a single request – but the
clock is ticking, and helping us with any of the three below ‘asks’
will be helpful to all teens, and all humans, everywhere.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Besides
– we’re teenagers, and believe NOTHING is impossible.

<p>
</p>
<p>Please
read the below three challenges - then below this, see
the <b>surprising</b> perks
we've been able to gather from all the adults that are supporting us
in this venture:</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>(1)
Endangered GLOBE world tour. </b>To
build awareness of the emerging global ecological dangers, we have
concerned friends that are building 3-15 high visibility (120’)
globes featuring endangered species atop it north pole that we can
bring to any city on the planet once we have an invitation. We need
your help to get your mayors across the planet to invite us to visit.
We are initially targeting:</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>•
New York (the UN, significant global/multinational/financial
leadership  representing many of the world’s largest CO2 players)</p>
<p>•
San Francisco/Silicon Valley (key eco innovation center, many green
mayors, an airport that could soon be underwater by the end of this
century)</p>
<p>•
Beijing and Shanghai (China leads the world in renewable energy
investment, $56.3 billion in 2013 alone)<a href=""#sdfootnote1sym"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><sup>1</sup></a>,
and mostly</p>
<p>•
Paris (home of 2015’s UN Climate
Change Conference
in Paris,
this coming November the home to what could be most important eco
summit in the history of humanity).</p>

<p><b>(2)
Collect then Distribute 422 (for 4/22/15 – Earth Day) Bike
Stations, ideally totaling at least 4220 bikes worldwide!  </b>To
further the health of our planet and the evolution of the ‘shared
economies’ that will save us - such as those of collaborative
economy pioneers like UBER and AirBNB – we are requesting bike and
cash donations and campaign volunteers to help us aggregate, then
distribute, 422 bike stations across the planet in service to this
2015 Earth Day, 4/22/15.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The
more cash and/or bikes you donate or buy, the greater the number of
people that will travel without generating the CO2 that is
threatening to eliminate the next ice age – and thus, increasing
the chances that the continued steady ocean rise will slow.  Please
help us collect, buy, distribute, promote – and use - these bikes.</p>

</p>
<p><b>(3)
ONE DAY BIKE CHALLENGE.  </b>We ask
that you challenge yourself, your parents and all the other adult
drivers your know to trade in your car or limos for a bike for one
day, capture this experience as still picture or video, then send it
to us and/or post it on social media on <a href=""http://ameglobe.world"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ameGlobe.world</a> for all to see
and be inspired by.  
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We
also ask that you each take responsibility for challenging three more
people to take, then record, our challenge.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Finally,
we also ask that you help us invite the
celebrities that we teens most greatly respect to take our challenge,
capture their biking experience via camera or film, then send it to
us and/or post it on social media for all to see and be inspired by. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We
choose President Obama, Candidate Clinton and CEO Cook as the
celebrities we most hope to join us because we not only admire each
of them, but also know that all three of them attended last year’s
Eco Summit in New York, and know that they know what we are talking
about – and fear. We also know that each of these celebrities cares
about the future of Earth’s children – their future voters and
consumers.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>See
below <b>The RULES AND PAY IT FORWARD
</b>for more information on the ONE DAY
BIKE CHALLENGE FOR THE GLOBE.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>THE RULES:</b> 
	
	
	
</p>
<p>Each
person, once challenged to our ONE DAY BIKE CHALLENGE, has one week
to comply or forfeit by making a financial donation to our site to
enable someone else to have access to a bike. Within a week of being
challenged participants must announce their acceptance via social
media or email to our site, then record a video or take a photo of them riding a
bike.  Finally, they must also nominate at least three more
persons to participate in the challenge.</p>
<p><b>OUR CHALLENGE:</b>  Dear President Obama, Secretary Clinton and CEO Cook – you, along with others, are hereby challenged to give up a car or limo for a day for a bike.  If – or others explicitly challenged – don’t do this, in the least we ask you to either buy a bike from our website or donate a bike worth at least $99. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>PAY IT FORWARD:</b> The rule to nominate others are derivative of the notion of “Pay It Forward” which “is an expression for describing the beneficiary of a good deed repaying it to others instead of to the original benefactor.”<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/2-teens-3-big-challenges-save-our-globe-s-future/edit/#_ftn1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[1]</a> The concept is old, but the need for Pay It Forward thinking if more vital than ever!</p>

<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We are also offering some very atypically cool gifts thanks to the adults that are supporting us (See Perks to the Right)</b><br/></p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">
</b></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">As
for other benefit, while is unlikely that we will be able to quantify
M/Tons of CO2 saved by your actions with the bikes, the real benefit
will be getting more and more people out of their cars or limos and
on to bikes (and mass transportation, and telecommuting from home).</span><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The
greater the number of global humans that see our site and video, or
see and use the free bikes we give away for shared use, or see our
120’ globes we hope to deliver across the planet, the greater the
number of humans – and their politicians - whom will ideally
experience both positive behavior changes and shifts in attitude
towards sustainability and against CO2.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Both
the bike challenge and the Globe Tour will continue to raise
awareness against the loud and uninformed voices of those who seek to
deny global ecological change.</p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<h3>Our Challenges</h3>
<p></p>
<p>This
eco-action does have real challenges:</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>•
Determining which cities get the globes</p>
<p>•
Paying for the globe's transportation</p>
<p>•
Minimizing collateral CO2 transmission associates with building and
shipping the globes</p>
<p>•
Finding volunteers in 422 cities to help us stage and maintain the
bikes</p>
<p>•
Collecting and optimally sharing any and all positive (and negative)
social media response we receive from other kids, their adults –
and celebrities that care!</p>
<p>•
Keeping our optimism – despite ever more ominous signs of doom.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In

BRING OUR EARTH TO YOUR CITY 
And...
A BIKE CHALLENGE
BIKE MORE, DRIVE LESS
3 BIG CHALLENGES, SAVE OUR MOTHER EARTH.

Short Summary
We, DYLAN
and TIGER, are two typical global teenagers from Silicon
Valley. 


We
believe that the bright futures and dreams that we and other teens
cling to against the challenges of growing up are increasingly at
risk due to the continued massive human abuse of the environment that
is resulting in our unstoppably rising oceans (see below “BACKGROUND”
for more on why we are scared). What We Need

Any
money and volunteers gathered from our modest Earth Day 2015 campaign
will go to powering our 3-pronged AME Globe campaign we are
putting together to make a measureable difference to help insure that
we kids – and our kids’ kids - enjoy a safe and wonderful future.


AME
stands for “A Mobile Ecology”, and the Globe stands for our
beautiful Earth.
We
understand that most campaigns have but a single request – but the
clock is ticking, and helping us with any of the three below ‘asks’
will be helpful to all teens, and all humans, everywhere.


Besides
– we’re teenagers, and believe NOTHING is impossible.  



Please
read the below three challenges - then below this, see
the surprising perks
we've been able to gather from all the adults that are supporting us
in this venture:


(1)
Endangered GLOBE world tour. To
build awareness of the emerging global ecological dangers, we have
concerned friends that are building 3-15 high visibility (120’)
globes featuring endangered species atop it north pole that we can
bring to any city on the planet once we have an invitation. We need
your help to get your mayors across the planet to invite us to visit.
We are initially targeting:


•
New York (the UN, significant global/multinational/financial
leadership  representing many of the world’s largest CO2 players)
•
San Francisco/Silicon Valley (key eco innovation center, many green
mayors, an airport that could soon be underwater by the end of this
century)
•
Beijing and Shanghai (China leads the world in renewable energy
investment, $56.3 billion in 2013 alone)1,
and mostly
•
Paris (home of 2015’s UN Climate
Change Conference
in Paris,
this coming November the home to what could be most important eco
summit in the history of humanity).


Click here to forward us your email, comments or requests for the globe.


(2)
Collect then Distribute 422 (for 4/22/15 – Earth Day) Bike
Stations, ideally totaling at least 4220 bikes worldwide!  To
further the health of our planet and the evolution of the ‘shared
economies’ that will save us - such as those of collaborative
economy pioneers like UBER and AirBNB – we are requesting bike and
cash donations and campaign volunteers to help us aggregate, then
distribute, 422 bike stations across the planet in service to this
2015 Earth Day, 4/22/15.


The
more cash and/or bikes you donate or buy, the greater the number of
people that will travel without generating the CO2 that is
threatening to eliminate the next ice age – and thus, increasing
the chances that the continued steady ocean rise will slow.  Please
help us collect, buy, distribute, promote – and use - these bikes.


If you’d like to volunteer, click here to send us an email with your information.


(3)
ONE DAY BIKE CHALLENGE.  We ask
that you challenge yourself, your parents and all the other adult
drivers your know to trade in your car or limos for a bike for one
day, capture this experience as still picture or video, then send it
to us and/or post it on social media on ameGlobe.world for all to see
and be inspired by.  



We
also ask that you each take responsibility for challenging three more
people to take, then record, our challenge.


Finally,
we also ask that you help us invite the
celebrities that we teens most greatly respect to take our challenge,
capture their biking experience via camera or film, then send it to
us and/or post it on social media for all to see and be inspired by. 



We
choose President Obama, Candidate Clinton and CEO Cook as the
celebrities we most hope to join us because we not only admire each
of them, but also know that all three of them attended last year’s
Eco Summit in New York, and know that they know what we are talking
about – and fear. We also know that each of these celebrities cares
about the future of Earth’s children – their future voters and
consumers.
If you’d like to get involved, click here to send us an email with your information, or submit images and stories of your bike challenge experience.


See
below The RULES AND PAY IT FORWARD
for more information on the ONE DAY
BIKE CHALLENGE FOR THE GLOBE.


THE RULES: 
	
	
	

Each
person, once challenged to our ONE DAY BIKE CHALLENGE, has one week
to comply or forfeit by making a financial donation to our site to
enable someone else to have access to a bike. Within a week of being
challenged participants must announce their acceptance via social
media or email to our site, then record a video or take a photo of them riding a
bike.  Finally, they must also nominate at least three more
persons to participate in the challenge.
OUR CHALLENGE:  Dear President Obama, Secretary Clinton and CEO Cook – you, along with others, are hereby challenged to give up a car or limo for a day for a bike.  If – or others explicitly challenged – don’t do this, in the least we ask you to either buy a bike from our website or donate a bike worth at least $99. 

PAY IT FORWARD: The rule to nominate others are derivative of the notion of “Pay It Forward” which “is an expression for describing the beneficiary of a good deed repaying it to others instead of to the original benefactor.”[1] The concept is old, but the need for Pay It Forward thinking if more vital than ever!


[1] http://www.payitforward.foundation/pages/fundraiser-challenge?gclid=Cj0KEQjw6tepBRDLqLnxouaY_pkBEiQAPIOiBnLen8TzP7mzh2QoOx-ZeGQ_TSte40S18mhm5D4Gg6kaAq1M8P8HAQ




What You Get
We are also offering some very atypically cool gifts thanks to the adults that are supporting us (See Perks to the Right)


As
for other benefit, while is unlikely that we will be able to quantify
M/Tons of CO2 saved by your actions with the bikes, the real benefit
will be getting more and more people out of their cars or limos and
on to bikes (and mass transportation, and telecommuting from home).


The
greater the number of global humans that see our site and video, or
see and use the free bikes we give away for shared use, or see our
120’ globes we hope to deliver across the planet, the greater the
number of humans – and their politicians - whom will ideally
experience both positive behavior changes and shifts in attitude
towards sustainability and against CO2.


Both
the bike challenge and the Globe Tour will continue to raise
awareness against the loud and uninformed voices of those who seek to
deny global ecological change.


Our Challenges

This
eco-action does have real challenges:


•
Determining which cities get the globes
•
Paying for the globe's transportation
•
Minimizing collateral CO2 transmission associates with building and
shipping the globes
•
Finding volunteers in 422 cities to help us stage and maintain the
bikes
•
Collecting and optimally sharing any and all positive (and negative)
social media response we receive from other kids, their adults –
and celebrities that care!
•
Keeping our optimism – despite ever more ominous signs of doom.



Other Ways You Can Help


In
addition to donating, volunteering via email and/or helping us get
the word out the following are other things you can do to help all of
us have a better and real future:


1. Wake
up and mount your own 'real' eco behavior change campaign.
2. Look
at the kids you love – and take real ACTION for them/us; we are
YOUR future.
3. Find
a way to express your voice before this next November’s Eco Summit
in Paris; stay tuned to the UN Foundation’s Action2015.org website
for activities near you.
4. Read
HIGH TIDE ON MAINSTREAM by John Englander
5. Support
the production and distribution of ANY media content that is
science-based and logically explain where things are going – and
more importantly, what we can modestly do to slow down the rise of,
and acidification from CO2 of, the oceans
6. Listen
to your gut when it comes to determining which information regarding
the environment is valuable versus constructed by those who lose as
we generate less CO2
7. Start
thinking about how we can help the folks that live closest to
sea-level
8. Start
thinking about inventions that can cool the ice, capture CO2 and help
the oceans retrieve their alkalinity
9. Make
Peace not War:  we will only survive if we can learn to live
collaborative within shared economies that are integrated across the
planet
10. Enjoy
your NOW.  Every minute, every breath, is a gift.


In Conclusion


With
a positive response from celebrities, such as President Obama,
Candidate Clinton and CEO Cook, we would hope for an exponential
growth in the number of people that will
see our site, and increasingly, 
dedicate energy and heart to protecting our precious planet.


We
- Tiger X and Dylan X- hope to sufficiently wake up enough of a
modest subset of humanity in time to change attitudes and behaviors
sufficiently to help guarantee a future life for all of us present
and future adults and kids - a life as wonderful as the lives that
our parents ourselves enjoyed and have, until now, taken for granted.

""Jeunes Volontaires pour l'Environnement"". Nous observons les effets
du changement climatique dans notre milieu et nous sommes disposés de prendre
l'initiative et changer les conditions de vie pour nous et les générations
futures.Que voulons-nous?Au niveau local, nous voulons augmenter la conscience sur les avantages
des énergies renouvelables. De plus, nous commençons à élever l’efficacité
énergétique des foyers aujourd’hui. 
Pourquoi nous appuyer?Avec votre appui et notre engagement, nous allons planter des arbres et
promouvoir des lampes solaires pour fournir aux communautés l’énergie
renouvelable. Grâce à des foyers améliorés nous réalisons deux objectifs à même
temps : nous réduisons les dangers pour la santé causée par la fumée des
foyers traditionnels et nous réduisons la quantité du bois nécessaire pour faire
la cuisine.



Quelles activités nous
réalisons?



Organisation des séances
de sensibilisation et de formation dans
les écoles primaires et l’école secondaire sur la protection de l’environnement
Aménagement des lieux
pour le reboisement en collaboration avec la mairie (espaces vertes sur le terrain
publique), les établissements et des personnes privées
Organisation des séances
de reboisement à Koma 3 et Fazao (mis en terre de 1000 plants pour la production de
bois énergie)
Exposition et vente des
foyers améliorés et lampes solaires dans les lieux publiques et service
(marché, préfecture…). Les foyers améliorés et lampes solaires sont fournis par
le Bureau Exécutive de JVE.
Organisation d’une
émission radio sur la problématique du changement climatique et de protection
de l’environnement (utilisation des énergies renouvelables, l’efficacité
énergétique, foyers améliorés, carbonisation amélioré comme quelques approches

<h2>Greywater Study- 1st of its kind</h2>
<p>Greywater Action is conducting a study of 100 simple greywater systems in California. Greywater reuse has the potential to save up to 50% of residential water use, saving water, time and money. So, why isn't everyone using greywater and every water district promoting it?</p>
<h3><span>Data gap</span></h3>
<p><span>There is a lack of scientific data on how these system function and how they affect soils and plants. Our study will find out how these systems function over time, how much maintenance is required, and will look at affects to soils and plants from products people use. </span></p>
<p><span>We'll share all our findings with the public and policy makers. </span></p>
<h3>Why our study is important</h3>
<p>We know greywater has the potential to save tens of thousands of gallons of water for a home, reduce flows into overloaded sewers and septic systems, grow food and greenery, while saving time, money, and encouraging healthier products to be used! There are so many potential benefits to greywater.

Support
in a truly GREEN environmental project to promote sustainable
landscapes by helping me publish a unique book about moss gardening
to be entitled, The Magical Realm
of Eco-friendly Mosses –  A Practical Guide to Moss Gardening
Projects. 





I’m
Annie Martin, also known as “Mossin' Annie.” As
a recognized expert in using bryophytes (mosses) as a horticultural
choice, I will provide insights into the
aesthetic, botanical and environmental reasons for choosing mosses
which will distinguish this book in the marketplace. Written in a
conversational style that will appeal to the lay person, this

moss word, this publication will posture my entrepreneurial business,
Mountain Moss Enterprises, as an innovative leader in the emerging
LIVE moss industry.


The
Impact – Greening Our World With MOSS

As people have
become more environmentally conscious, there has been a growing
interest in mosses. These amazing plants are not only beautiful with
their year-round green but they offer solutions to environmental
concerns of groundwater contamination, erosion control, and reducing
air pollution. Because of their unique botanical characteristics,
mosses require NO chemicals – NO fertilizers, NO pesticides, and NO
herbicides – in contrast to common practices used in traditional
landscaping and lawn maintenance. 



It has been a
challenge for gardeners to move beyond myths and generalizations
about these miniature plants and to proceed with proven methods for
success that are bryophyte specific. Indeed, all mosses don't just
live on the north side or in the shade. In fact, there are many types
that even tolerate sun exposures. Many people have expressed interest
in the publication of a moss book that highlights a variety of
innovative and sustainable approaches for “greening” our urban
environments. The Magical Realm of Eco-friendly Mosses will
fill an information void on topics not covered in the handful of
print references currently available in the international
marketplace. 



My
book will explore benefits of bryophytes as a green alternative for
innovative landscapes, moss lawns, living walls and green roofs. By
promoting the benefits of mosses as a plant choice and providing
expert planting advice, this book will enable people to embrace these
fascinating plants! 




What
We Need – Raising the Green MOSS $$$

As a entrepreneur
and leader in the moss movement, I need your financial support to
help make this book a reality. Donations will be used to proceed with
writing this valuable reference and publishing an eBook and a soft
cover print version. By publishing in a variety of formats, we can reach a
wider target market as we disseminate our “mossy” philosophy. Our
outstanding photography will enhance the informative content. 



To publish a book
requires more than just writing a good manuscript. The myriad of
functions in the process includes the following steps:


designing an
	appealing layout; 
	


editing and
	proofing for accuracy; 
	


ensuring a
	user-friendly cross-referenced index 
	


acquiring
	necessary ISBN, LCCN, SAN registration for worldwide retail sales
	and easier accessioning by libraries; 
	


obtaining a
	copyright to protect intellectual property; 
	


preparing
	files for ebook formats and print Publishing on Demand  (POD) books; 
	


developing
	effective marketing strategies; 
	


implementing
	distribution.



A portion of the
budget will be allocated to cover basic living expenses while writing
the book. Other functions will be addressed by utilizing my
professional background in graphic design, photography and print
production with assistance from other freelance contractors. An
editing team composed of a professional editor, experienced proofer,
expert indexer, respected bryologist, and typical readers, will be an
essential component to ensure quality of the publications. Funds will
also cover actual publishing costs, administrative functions and fees
associated with official registrations, and to initiate an effective
marketing campaign. 



After raising
necessary funds, writing of the manuscript will begin in late Fall
2011 with the goal of producing a draft copy by late Winter. By
Spring, we expect to send both the ebook and the print versions to
the publishers. We have targeted early Summer for the official book
release date. Through effective marketing and with a “little help
from our friends”, we anticipate a positive response and
significant sales by the end of 2012. 



We project that
book sales will provide “bread and butter” capital for Mountain
Moss Enterprises throughout the year especially during the winter
holiday season when typical landscaping projects slow down. Profits
from this book will be funneled into more books... and continued
educational outreach, cultivation research as well as groundbreaking
projects.

Concluding
Remarks – MOSSY Thanks


I have approached all my business
dealings in good spirit and I've really enjoyed sharing my passion
for mosses with others. Despite hardships of starting a niche
business in an economic recession, I have been determined to promote
the environmental value of mosses through a variety of avenues and
maintain a positive vision. Publishing this book is critical next
step in our educational mission and desire to share the joys and
advantages of mosses.

<u><b>Executive
summary:</b></u></p><p>My
name is Eric Parage. I am a French citizen and live in Dominican
Republic since five years after having traveled extensively most of
my life. I’ve literally fell in love with the country and the
people therefore I’ve decided to settle down in this stunning
nature to raise my kid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
	In
2013, my
interest in the Dominican art led
me to
meet with local artist and I have created
a website to
support local craftwork (<u><a href=""http://www.artesania-dominicano.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.artesania-dominicano.com</a></u>).
This was the first milestone to a more ambitious project: sharing the
Dominican jewel by creating a new concept of eco-lodge: <b>The
SeaSunEco Dominicano</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>
	Nestled
in one of the most beautiful area of the island, the eco-lodge will
be entirely self-sufficient with the capacity of 16 guests divided
into 4 bungalows surrounding a central building with restaurant, bar, terrace and green pool. Construction will be made of natural materials to reduce
our ecological footprint and minimize the overall cost of the
project.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
	The
aim of the eco-lodge is to offer visitors the opportunity to be
engaged in eco-solutions by participating and sharing experience.
Various activities will be proposed to get a chance to learn how
solar energy works, how to reduce or recycle waste, to grow organic
food…and more.</p>
<p>
<b>The
SeaSunEco Dominicano </b>is
meant to become an interactive platform of knowledge sharing, a place
where vacation is rewarding for all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
	The
site will welcome all kind of clients, from individual to family and
groups with a particular emphasis to workshops focusing on
environmental topics.  
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
	The
overall budget of <b>200,000
euros</b>
as described below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
€ 50,000:
purchase of land + associated government fees</p>
<p>
€ 60,000:
building material + labor</p>
<p>
€ 25,000:
architects fees + administrative costs + miscellaneous</p>
<p>
€ 65,000:
first year running fees</p>
<p>
</p><p>
	To
start the project, crowdfunding will be flexible to be able to
finalize the drawings, purchase the land and devote effort to make it
happen. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
	You
will have the opportunity to acquired vouchers that will correspond
to “booking days” at <b>SeaSunEco
Dominicano.</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>
<b>1
day = 150 euros</b></p>
<p>
<b>1

These Solar Plants will symbolize the heart of our eco-lodge by
providing energy and comfort to our guests. They represent the
combination of the latest technology associated with local raw
material, a symbol to express that our future is founded on our
heritage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
	Indeed,
this project is for me the most tangible way to share my willingness
to protect the environment, to preserve the harmony between nature
and men, and to share findings with everyone.</p>
<p>
I
want this eco-lodge to be a friendly place where people can
understand our complex environmental issues and experience simple
eco-solutions; an eco-lodge where guests can relax in a pleasant area
and also contribute, if they wish, to make this place a jewel of
peacefulness.

	Associez
votre nom à SeaSunEco-Dominicano
par l'acquisition d'une ""centrale
solaire""
pour 5000
euros.
Ces centrales solaires feront symboliser le cœur de notre éco-lodge
en fournissant de l'énergie et le confort à nos clients. Ils
représentent la combinaison de la technologie de pointe associée à
des matières premières locales, un symbole pour exprimer que notre
avenir repose sur notre patrimoine. 



	En
effet, ce projet est pour moi le moyen le plus tangible de partager
ma volonté de protéger l'environnement, pour préserver l'harmonie
entre la nature et les hommes, et de partager les résultats avec
tout le monde. 


Je
veux que cet éco-lodge soit un lieu convivial où les gens peuvent
comprendre nos problèmes environnementaux et
éco-solutions; un éco-lodge où vous pourrez vous détendre dans un
cadre agréable et contribuer également, si vous le souhaitez, a
faire de cet endroit un bijou de quiétude. 



	Votre
aide est précieuse pour ce projet. Si vous ne pouvez pas contribuer
financièrement je comprends, et je vais vous demander de faire passer le
message. Le site Indiegogo met des outils a votre disposition pour ceci. Peut-être que
vous connaissez quelqu'un qui peut nous aider. Il ya peut-être parmi
vous des personnes ayant des compétences particulières (par exemple: la construction, la nourriture organique, l'énergie renouvelable, etc ...) qui peuvent
participer au développement et y contribuer d'une manière ou d'une
autre. Toute aide quelle que ce soit sera précieuse. Croyez-moi. 



	Je
vous remercie tous personellement et espère vous rencontrer bientot

Resumen
ejecutivo:



	Mi
nombre es Eric Parage. Soy un ciudadano francés y vivo en República
Dominicana desde hace cinco años después de haber viajado mucho por
la mayor parte de mi vida. Literalmente, he enamoré con el país y
la gente, por lo tanto he decidido a establecerse en esta
impresionante naturaleza para cuidar a mi hijo. 



	En
2013, mi interés en el arte dominicano me llevó a reunirse con el
artista local y he creado un sitio web para apoyar la artesanía
local (www.artesania-dominicano.com). Este fue el primer hito de un
proyecto más ambicioso: compartir la joya Dominicana mediante la
creación de un nuevo concepto de eco-lodge: El
SeaSunEco-Dominicano.


	Ubicado
en una de las zonas más bellas de la isla, el eco-lodge será
totalmente autosuficiente con la capacidad de 16 personas divididas
en 4 bungalows que rodean un edificio central con restaurante, bar, terraza y piscina verde. La construcción se hizo con materiales naturales para
reducir nuestra huella ecológica y minimizar el coste total del
proyecto. 



	El
objetivo de la eco-lodge es ofrecer a los visitantes la oportunidad
de intervenir en las eco-soluciones mediante la participación y el
intercambio de experiencias. Se proponen varias actividades para
tener la oportunidad de aprender cómo funciona la energía solar, la
manera de reducir o reciclar los residuos, para crecer orgánica de
alimentos ... y más. 


El
SeaSunEco-Dominicano
está destinado a convertirse en una plataforma interactiva de
intercambio de conocimientos, un lugar donde las vacaciones es
gratificante para todos. 



El
sitio dará la bienvenida a todo tipo de clientes, desde individuales
a familiares y grupos con un énfasis particular a los talleres
centrados en temas ambientales. 




El
presupuesto global de 200.000
euros,
como se describe a continuación: 



€ 50000:
compra de tierras + tasas gubernamentales asociadas 


€ 60.000:
material de construcción + mano de obra

€ 25.000:
honorarios de arquitectos + gastos administrativos + miscelánea 


€ 65.000:
honorarios de funcionamiento de primer año 



Para
iniciar el proyecto, crowdfunding será flexible para poder finalizar
los dibujos, comprar la tierra y dedicar esfuerzo para que esto
ocurra. 







Usted
tendrá la oportunidad de vales adquiridos que corresponderán a los
""días de reserva"" en SeaSunEco-Dominicano.




1
día = € 150 


1
semana (5 noches / 6 días) = € 600 


Tarjeta
verde (1 semana para dos adultos) = € 1200 



También
son muy bienvenidos a ayudarnos mediante el apoyo a nuestro proyecto
o suscribirse a nuestro boletín. Las transmisiones estarán
disponibles en nuestro sitio web de seguirnos en nuestras últimas
actividades y eventos. 




Asociar
su nombre a SeaSunEco-Dominicano
mediante la adquisición de una ""Planta
Solar""
por 5.000
euros.
Estas plantas solares simbolizarán el corazón de nuestra eco-lodge,
proporcionando energía y confort a nuestros huéspedes. Ellos
representan la combinación de la última tecnología relacionados
con las materias primas locales, un símbolo para expresar que
nuestro futuro se basa en nuestra herencia. 



De
hecho, este proyecto es para mí la forma más tangible de compartir
mi buena voluntad de proteger el medio ambiente, para preservar la
armonía entre la naturaleza y los hombres, y para compartir los
resultados con todo el mundo. 


Quiero
que este eco-lodge sea un lugar agradable donde la gente puede
entender nuestros problemas ambientales complejos y experiencia
sencilla eco-soluciones; un eco-lodge, donde los huéspedes pueden
relajarse en una zona agradable y también contribuir, si así lo
desean, para hacer de este lugar una joya de tranquilidad. 



Tu
ayuda es muy valiosa para este proyecto. Si no puede contribuir
financieramente voy a entender, y simplemente le voy a preguntar a
difundir la palabra. El sitio Indiegogo tiene herramientas para
hacerlo. Tal vez conozcas a alguien que pueda ayudar. Hay tal vez
entre vosotros personas con habilidades especiales (por ejemplo,
construcción, alimentos orgánicos, etc ...) que pueden participar
en el desarrollo y contribuir de una u otra manera. Cualquier ayuda
en absoluto será valiosa. Confía en mí. 



Personalmente,
agradezco a todos y espero conocerte en

<p><b>Who are we?</b> As members, volunteers and supporters of Underwater Research Society of Turkey, we are research divers from all over Turkey. Since 2007, we have been looking for shipwrecks, sunken harbors, any trace of ancient cultures. So far, we found 7 ancient shipwrecks and more than 700 archaeological objects along the Lycian coast of Turkey.<br/></p>
<p><b>Why do we need money? </b>For doing research! We got a last minute approval for our research permission, and it was already too late for academic grant applications and sponsorship. Volunteers cover their own expenses (travel food) but we need a boat to reach the shipwrecks.</p>
<p><b>Why do I donate money?</b> For experiencing the 3D virtual tours to these shipwrecks or any other reason that you feel comfortable with.<br/></p>
<p><b>Who I am?</b> Dive Instructor (PADI, CMAS), architect, academician, nautical archaeologist. I studied in, took certificates from METU, Bilkent and ITU (Turkey) and TAMU and UCLA (US) and NAS (UK). </p>
<p><b>When do you start?</b> Our field project starts in November 16th in Turkey. After we are done gathering underwater data, we have few months to finish the web application/ implementations of these shipwrecks.</p>

<p>Museum without walls: <br/></p>
<p>The museum is considered to be the ideal place for the highest level of preservation for cultural heritage. However, separated from its context, isolated from its meaning; the cultural heritage of various spaces and time is enclosed in a single place, a heterotopian space as defined by Foucault. After the advent of digital technologies, the meaning of museum has shifted using the virtuality, giving birth to a new concept of virtual museum. In the digital domain, peculiarities of museum, library and archive have merged into each other. As opposed to brick and mortar versions, these institutions are liberated in many aspects. Referring to Malraux, the digital heritage has become a separate<br/>entity, detached from its original context, bringing new opportunities to the digital heritage data. In this specific example on underwater cultural heritage data, the musealization of nautical archaeology will both create a reference data for further academic researches and promote the dissemination of underwater cultural heritage. To accomplish this aim, this project proposes a framework of a virtual museum that incorporates the practices of collection, preservation, research, visualization and exhibit, thus offers new approaches to the preservation of cultural heritage.<br/></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><p></p>

<p>
	Kendimi tanıtayım. Mimar, dalgıç, sivil toplum kuruluşu üyesi, arkeolog, sualtı korumacı... ODTÜ, Bilkent, Texas A&amp;M, İTÜ, UCLA gibi kurumlarda dirsek çürüttüm ve son 15 senedir de ODTÜ-SAT ve SAD (Sualtı Araştırmaları Derneği) üyesiyim. 1997'den beri sualtında, 2006 yılından beri ise Kaş'ta sualtı araştırmaları yapan bir avuç Don Kişot'un yanında, başında ve arkasında yer aldım. Yıllardır, kıyılarda ve sualtıda bulunan arkeolojik eserleri araştırmak, bulmak, incelemek, tanıtmak ve bu mirası ulusal ve uluslararası çevrelere anlatmak için hem Türkiye'de hem yurtdışında kapı kapı dolaşıyorum.
</p>
<p>
	TÜBİTAK, TÜBA, Avrupa Birliği, Dünya Bankası, ARIT, AKMED ve benzeri kurumlardan fonlar aldım, alamadığımda da cebimden harcadım.
</p>
<p>
	Şimdiye kadar büyük bir aileydik. 500'e yakın kişi gönüllü projemizde daldı, batık buldu, fotoğraf çekti, araziye gelemediyse de bilgisayar başından yardım etti.
</p>
<p>
	Aynı zamanda çoğu avcılığa ve yer yer rekreasyonel dalışa dahi kapalı koruma alanı da olan dünyaca ünlü Patara - Kekova bölgesinin, eşsiz sualtı kültür mirasını yerinde keşif ve belgeleyerek, hiç dokunmadan sayısallaştırıp, internet üzerinden erişilen bir sanal müze haline getirmek için çalışmaktayız. 2007'de başlayan projemiz her yıl ilgili kurumların onaylarıyla birlikte etap etap ilerlemekte.
</p>
<p>
	Ne var ki bu sene sadece 8 kişiyiz.
</p>
<p>
	2013 yılı arazi çalışması için Kültür ve Turizm Bakanlığı izin ve onaylarımız iki yıllık uzun bir bekleyişten sonra maalesef sonbaharın ilk günlerinde geldi. Yani gönüllülerimizin çoğunun takım elbiselerini giydiği mesailerine kesin dönüş yapmak durumunda olduğu, suların da dalış için son derece elverişsizleştiği bir dönemde.
</p>
<p>
	Dahası bu iznin 2013 bitmeden kullanılması gerekmekte. Aksi durum, projemizin önümüzdeki etaplarını da olumsuz etkileyeceğinden; video ve fotoğraf makinalarımız, dalış malzemelerimiz, bu malzemenin hakkını sonuna kadar verecek, gönüllü ekibimizin işlerinden güçlerinden izin alabilen en kahramanları ile birlikte 9-17 Kasım'da Kaş'tayız.
</p>
<p>
	6 senelik araştırmada bulduğumuz 7 batık gün yüzüne çıkmak için bizi bekliyor.
</p>
<p>
	Görüntülerimizi alıp size internetten sunacağız.
</p>
<p>
	Ancak ekibimizin ufak iki eksiği var batıklarımız, yüzerek gidemeyeceğimiz uzaklıkta ve proje süresi de aç ve susuz geçiremeyeceğimiz kadar uzun. Tekne kiralamamız ve günüllülerimizin karınlarını doyurmamız gerekiyor.
</p>
<p>
	Ufak desteklerinizle bu sualtı mirasını gün yüzüne taşıyacağız ve size internet üzerinden sunmakla kalmayacak, bir yandan da UCLA'deki <a href=""http://hypercities.ats.ucla.edu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://hypercities.ats.ucla.edu/</a> projesine katılan ilk sualtı ekibi olma öncülüğünü gerçekleştireceğiz.
</p>
<p>
	Sizin için belki küçük, ancak bizim için muazzam desteklerinizle...

What is this? A campaign for a research project on nautical archaeology of Turkey
Who are we? As members, volunteers and supporters of Underwater Research Society of Turkey, we are research divers from all over Turkey. Since 2007, we have been looking for shipwrecks, sunken harbors, any trace of ancient cultures. So far, we found 7 ancient shipwrecks and more than 700 archaeological objects along the Lycian coast of Turkey.
Why do we need money? For doing research! We got a last minute approval for our research permission, and it was already too late for academic grant applications and sponsorship. Volunteers cover their own expenses (travel food) but we need a boat to reach the shipwrecks.
Why do I donate money? For experiencing the 3D virtual tours to these shipwrecks or any other reason that you feel comfortable with.
Who I am? Dive Instructor (PADI, CMAS), architect, academician, nautical archaeologist. I studied in, took certificates from METU, Bilkent and ITU (Turkey) and TAMU and UCLA (US) and NAS (UK). 
When do you start? Our field project starts in November 16th in Turkey. After we are done gathering underwater data, we have few months to finish the web application/ implementations of these shipwrecks.
I am an academician and I need more fancy explanation about your project?
Here you are...

Museum without walls: 
The museum is considered to be the ideal place for the highest level of preservation for cultural heritage. However, separated from its context, isolated from its meaning; the cultural heritage of various spaces and time is enclosed in a single place, a heterotopian space as defined by Foucault. After the advent of digital technologies, the meaning of museum has shifted using the virtuality, giving birth to a new concept of virtual museum. In the digital domain, peculiarities of museum, library and archive have merged into each other. As opposed to brick and mortar versions, these institutions are liberated in many aspects. Referring to Malraux, the digital heritage has become a separateentity, detached from its original context, bringing new opportunities to the digital heritage data. In this specific example on underwater cultural heritage data, the musealization of nautical archaeology will both create a reference data for further academic researches and promote the dissemination of underwater cultural heritage. To accomplish this aim, this project proposes a framework of a virtual museum that incorporates the practices of collection, preservation, research, visualization and exhibit, thus offers new approaches to the preservation of cultural heritage.

Sualti Kultur Mirasi Sanal Muzesi
Ben Güzden. Bu mesaj size ulaşıyorsa siz veya yakın çevrenizden birisi projelerimize katılmıştır ya da sizi deniz, çevre ve tarih koruma konularında duyarlı birisi olarak görüyordur.


	Kendimi tanıtayım. Mimar, dalgıç, sivil toplum kuruluşu üyesi, arkeolog, sualtı korumacı... ODTÜ, Bilkent, Texas A&M, İTÜ, UCLA gibi kurumlarda dirsek çürüttüm ve son 15 senedir de ODTÜ-SAT ve SAD (Sualtı Araştırmaları Derneği) üyesiyim. 1997'den beri sualtında, 2006 yılından beri ise Kaş'ta sualtı araştırmaları yapan bir avuç Don Kişot'un yanında, başında ve arkasında yer aldım. Yıllardır, kıyılarda ve sualtıda bulunan arkeolojik eserleri araştırmak, bulmak, incelemek, tanıtmak ve bu mirası ulusal ve uluslararası çevrelere anlatmak için hem Türkiye'de hem yurtdışında kapı kapı dolaşıyorum.


	TÜBİTAK, TÜBA, Avrupa Birliği, Dünya Bankası, ARIT, AKMED ve benzeri kurumlardan fonlar aldım, alamadığımda da cebimden harcadım.


	Şimdiye kadar büyük bir aileydik. 500'e yakın kişi gönüllü projemizde daldı, batık buldu, fotoğraf çekti, araziye gelemediyse de bilgisayar başından yardım etti.


	Aynı zamanda çoğu avcılığa ve yer yer rekreasyonel dalışa dahi kapalı koruma alanı da olan dünyaca ünlü Patara - Kekova bölgesinin, eşsiz sualtı kültür mirasını yerinde keşif ve belgeleyerek, hiç dokunmadan sayısallaştırıp, internet üzerinden erişilen bir sanal müze haline getirmek için çalışmaktayız. 2007'de başlayan projemiz her yıl ilgili kurumların onaylarıyla birlikte etap etap ilerlemekte.


	Ne var ki bu sene sadece 8 kişiyiz.


	2013 yılı arazi çalışması için Kültür ve Turizm Bakanlığı izin ve onaylarımız iki yıllık uzun bir bekleyişten sonra maalesef sonbaharın ilk günlerinde geldi. Yani gönüllülerimizin çoğunun takım elbiselerini giydiği mesailerine kesin dönüş yapmak durumunda olduğu, suların da dalış için son derece elverişsizleştiği bir dönemde.


	Dahası bu iznin 2013 bitmeden kullanılması gerekmekte. Aksi durum, projemizin önümüzdeki etaplarını da olumsuz etkileyeceğinden; video ve fotoğraf makinalarımız, dalış malzemelerimiz, bu malzemenin hakkını sonuna kadar verecek, gönüllü ekibimizin işlerinden güçlerinden izin alabilen en kahramanları ile birlikte 9-17 Kasım'da Kaş'tayız.


	6 senelik araştırmada bulduğumuz 7 batık gün yüzüne çıkmak için bizi bekliyor.


	Görüntülerimizi alıp size internetten sunacağız.


	Ancak ekibimizin ufak iki eksiği var batıklarımız, yüzerek gidemeyeceğimiz uzaklıkta ve proje süresi de aç ve susuz geçiremeyeceğimiz kadar uzun. Tekne kiralamamız ve günüllülerimizin karınlarını doyurmamız gerekiyor.


	Ufak desteklerinizle bu sualtı mirasını gün yüzüne taşıyacağız ve size internet üzerinden sunmakla kalmayacak, bir yandan da UCLA'deki http://hypercities.ats.ucla.edu/ projesine katılan ilk sualtı ekibi olma öncülüğünü gerçekleştireceğiz.


	Sizin için belki küçük, ancak bizim için muazzam desteklerinizle...

This forest acts as a critical carbon sink and climate regulator, affecting rainfall patterns and weather as far away as North America and Europe (Nkem et al 2008 and WWF). The magnitude of this effect suggests that the success or failure of environmental stewardship in the Congo will substantially impact our planet’s health in the coming decades. Therefore, while the Congo faces ongoing challenges from competing domestic and international interests, local indigenous leadership has been growing in response to these challenges in order to achieve peace, security, and stability.</p><p>Founded in 2007, the <a href=""http://www.congoinitiative.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Congo Initiative</a>-Université Chrétienne Bilingue du Congo (UCBC), in Beni, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) meets the need for indigenous leadership by providing its students with a transformative education that encourages service learning, innovative action, character formation, and academic rigor. It is UCBC students who are paving a new way forward at the intersection of environmental sustainability, economic development and community wellbeing. </p><br/><p><b>Where does Y.E.C.A. come in?</b></p><p>In May 2014, Y.E.C.A. entered into an exciting partnership with UCBC to support, train and equip young leaders around climate action.  Over the past year, our inaugural UCBC Climate Leadership Fellows, Sifa Jolie and Faden, have led incredible initiatives to build climate change awareness on their campus, as well as to promote composting, recycling and renewable energy on their campus and in their community. See their mid-year report here: <a href=""http://www.yecaction.org/partnering-across-borders-midyear-report-on-sifa-jolie-and-faden-yeca-fellows/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fellows Mid-Year Report</a>.</p><p>While our fellows have been doing phenomenal work, there has been a vocalized need for more advanced natural science training among the larger UCBC community. In addition to UCBC’s own efforts to connect with environmental organizations in the region, Y.E.C.A. has facilitated relationships between UCBC and larger creation care networks throughout East Africa. One of the outcomes of these budding relationships is the opportunity for a team of nine UCBC students, faculty and staff to travel to Kenya during the month of May, and they have invited the Y.E.C.A. team to accompany them during this time of training.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/LIwy5sV7gjPFUIjU8dyiCsjVTEDRkNWR2XVc9bbA8vJa28nOYgbJQ7OVFsepYDxtp9H93j8Na9Bw5KTjTskxgaUwKdTEq2ymcbW_zKuScY8pEhG2WZkidqnbXyQpkPe8ts-tKJk"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>(Climate Fellows Faden and Sifa Jolie)</p><br/><p><b>What’s Happening this Summer?</b></p><p>From May 14-June 8, 2015, four Y.E.C.A. Steering Committee members hope to further develop our partnership with UCBC and reconnect with our Congolese Climate Leadership Fellows during a three part trip in East Africa. We have been invited by a UCBC team of creation care and climate change leaders to join them as they: </p><ol>
<li><p>Establish relationships with other regional creation care leaders at the <a href=""http://www.greenanglicans.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/East-Central-Africa-Conf-on-Creation-Care-the-Gospel-May-2015-2.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lausanne Creation Care and the Gospel Conference</a> in Nairobi, Kenya </p></li>
<li><p>Engage in natural science training at <a href=""http://arocha.org/en/a-rocha-kenya/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A Rocha Kenya’s</a> Science Field Study Center in Malindi, Kenya </p></li>
<li><p>Develop and implement creation care and climate action plans for their campus and local communities in and around Beni, DRC.</p></li>
</ol><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>What is the Lausanne Creation Care Network?</b></p><p>Just in case you thought there weren’t enough acronyms floating around, the Lausanne Creation Care Network (LCCN) embodies the global creation care efforts of organizations like A Rocha International, Care of Creation, and World Evangelical Alliance.  LCCN is organizing regional conferences in many regions of the world in a globally-focused campaign to jumpstart and reinvigorate nations to implement creation care projects.  This May we will join students, pastors, seminary professors, and Christian leaders from various organizations and churches across East and Central Africa “to learn how a biblically-based approach to creation care can play an important role in discipleship and holistic development.” During the last day of the conference, participants will gather with others from their nation to form national plans that faithfully address creation care opportunities and challenges.</p><br/><p><b>What is the team doing at A Rocha Kenya?</b></p><p>A Rocha Kenya (ARK) is a Christian conservation organization which was established on the Kenyan coast in 1999. A Rocha is committed to environmental action through community conservation projects. The team will be staying at Mwamba, ARK’s field study center, to learn practical lessons from A Rocha’s ongoing conservation projects. In addition to learning from the staff at A Rocha Kenya, the UCBC climate leaders and fellows will be spending focused time together as a group, and drawing from the experience of the YECA steering committee members, will form a creation care and climate action plan to take back to their campus and community in Congo.  The team has specifically requested training in the areas of:</p><ul><li><p>Waste management and compost production</p></li></ul><ul>
<li><p>Conservation agriculture and agroforestry</p></li>
<li><p>Ecotourism</p></li>
</ul><p>It will be a time for growth; moving from a biblical understanding of the importance of creation care into practical, obedient, transforming action in their lives and the lives of their neighbors.</p><br/><p><b>How will we accompany the team in Beni, DRC?</b></p><p>Building off of our existing relationships with many students, faculty and staff at UCBC, the YECA team will have the opportunity to support the initial implementation of the creation care and climate action plans developed by the UCBC leaders during their time in Kenya. This may specifically include co-leading trainings to the larger campus community on topics such as sustainability, the theology of creation care, and introductory environmental science. We will also be able to spend strategic time with our Climate Leadership Fellows and engage in person their work on campus and in the local community. By walking with them through their typical school day, we can help our fellows identify ongoing areas for partnership and support.</p><br/><p><b>How can YOU help?</b></p><p>As discussed above, our Climate Leadership Fellows and other creation care leaders from UCBC have invited us to join them in Kenya and DRC for this critical period of leadership training. We are committed to making this happen, however, Y.E.C.A. is a young organization and limited in its ability to self-fund large travel expenses. Despite these limitations, we are eager to invest our time into our fellows and partners at UCBC by joining them during the trip. We would be honored if you joined us as financial partners in our efforts! Here is the breakdown of how we will be using the funds that are raised:</p><ul>
<li><p>$4,446 - Flights to and from as well as within East Africa</p></li>
<li><p>$2,365 - Room and Board in Kenya, Uganda, and Democratic Republic of Congo</p></li>
<li><p>$795 - Visas - Kenya, Uganda Transit Visa, Democratic Republic of Congo</p></li>
<li><p>$775 - Ground Transportation </p></li>
<li><p>$156 - Training and experiential learning opportunities</p></li>
</ul><p>Total = $8,537<br/></p><p><b>Any money that we raise over our goal, or that goes unused during the trip, will go directly into the Y.E.C.A. Climate Fellows Fund, which will support our current and future cohorts of climate activists in the DR Congo.</b></p><p>More important than the raising of funds for the trip is the support of your prayers. As a Christian organization, we at Y.E.C.A. believe that faithfully trusting in God’s providence is central to all of our initiatives.  Specifically for this trip, please pray for:</p><ul>
<li><p>Safe travel for Y.E.C.A. steering committee members and the UCBC team</p></li>
<li><p>Strong friendships and partnerships to develop between members of different organizations and between people of varied backgrounds and nationalities</p></li>
<li><p>That we would be attentive listeners, receptive to the needs, wants, and questions of the UCBC team as they consider what it looks like to live as faithful stewards in their context</p></li>
<li><p>Humility and trust in God as the Y.E.C.A. and UCBC teams seek to address the increasingly immense issue of climate change</p></li>

This forest acts as a critical carbon sink and climate regulator, affecting rainfall patterns and weather as far away as North America and Europe (Nkem et al 2008 and WWF). The magnitude of this effect suggests that the success or failure of environmental stewardship in the Congo will substantially impact our planet’s health in the coming decades. Therefore, while the Congo faces ongoing challenges from competing domestic and international interests, local indigenous leadership has been growing in response to these challenges in order to achieve peace, security, and stability.Founded in 2007, the Congo Initiative-Université Chrétienne Bilingue du Congo (UCBC), in Beni, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) meets the need for indigenous leadership by providing its students with a transformative education that encourages service learning, innovative action, character formation, and academic rigor. It is UCBC students who are paving a new way forward at the intersection of environmental sustainability, economic development and community wellbeing. Where does Y.E.C.A. come in?In May 2014, Y.E.C.A. entered into an exciting partnership with UCBC to support, train and equip young leaders around climate action.  Over the past year, our inaugural UCBC Climate Leadership Fellows, Sifa Jolie and Faden, have led incredible initiatives to build climate change awareness on their campus, as well as to promote composting, recycling and renewable energy on their campus and in their community. See their mid-year report here: Fellows Mid-Year Report.While our fellows have been doing phenomenal work, there has been a vocalized need for more advanced natural science training among the larger UCBC community. In addition to UCBC’s own efforts to connect with environmental organizations in the region, Y.E.C.A. has facilitated relationships between UCBC and larger creation care networks throughout East Africa. One of the outcomes of these budding relationships is the opportunity for a team of nine UCBC students, faculty and staff to travel to Kenya during the month of May, and they have invited the Y.E.C.A. team to accompany them during this time of training.(Climate Fellows Faden and Sifa Jolie)What’s Happening this Summer?From May 14-June 8, 2015, four Y.E.C.A. Steering Committee members hope to further develop our partnership with UCBC and reconnect with our Congolese Climate Leadership Fellows during a three part trip in East Africa. We have been invited by a UCBC team of creation care and climate change leaders to join them as they: 
Establish relationships with other regional creation care leaders at the Lausanne Creation Care and the Gospel Conference in Nairobi, Kenya 
Engage in natural science training at A Rocha Kenya’s Science Field Study Center in Malindi, Kenya 
Develop and implement creation care and climate action plans for their campus and local communities in and around Beni, DRC.
What is the Lausanne Creation Care Network?Just in case you thought there weren’t enough acronyms floating around, the Lausanne Creation Care Network (LCCN) embodies the global creation care efforts of organizations like A Rocha International, Care of Creation, and World Evangelical Alliance.  LCCN is organizing regional conferences in many regions of the world in a globally-focused campaign to jumpstart and reinvigorate nations to implement creation care projects.  This May we will join students, pastors, seminary professors, and Christian leaders from various organizations and churches across East and Central Africa “to learn how a biblically-based approach to creation care can play an important role in discipleship and holistic development.” During the last day of the conference, participants will gather with others from their nation to form national plans that faithfully address creation care opportunities and challenges.What is the team doing at A Rocha Kenya?A Rocha Kenya (ARK) is a Christian conservation organization which was established on the Kenyan coast in 1999. A Rocha is committed to environmental action through community conservation projects. The team will be staying at Mwamba, ARK’s field study center, to learn practical lessons from A Rocha’s ongoing conservation projects. In addition to learning from the staff at A Rocha Kenya, the UCBC climate leaders and fellows will be spending focused time together as a group, and drawing from the experience of the YECA steering committee members, will form a creation care and climate action plan to take back to their campus and community in Congo.  The team has specifically requested training in the areas of:Waste management and compost production
Conservation agriculture and agroforestry
Ecotourism
It will be a time for growth; moving from a biblical understanding of the importance of creation care into practical, obedient, transforming action in their lives and the lives of their neighbors.How will we accompany the team in Beni, DRC?Building off of our existing relationships with many students, faculty and staff at UCBC, the YECA team will have the opportunity to support the initial implementation of the creation care and climate action plans developed by the UCBC leaders during their time in Kenya. This may specifically include co-leading trainings to the larger campus community on topics such as sustainability, the theology of creation care, and introductory environmental science. We will also be able to spend strategic time with our Climate Leadership Fellows and engage in person their work on campus and in the local community. By walking with them through their typical school day, we can help our fellows identify ongoing areas for partnership and support.How can YOU help?As discussed above, our Climate Leadership Fellows and other creation care leaders from UCBC have invited us to join them in Kenya and DRC for this critical period of leadership training. We are committed to making this happen, however, Y.E.C.A. is a young organization and limited in its ability to self-fund large travel expenses. Despite these limitations, we are eager to invest our time into our fellows and partners at UCBC by joining them during the trip. We would be honored if you joined us as financial partners in our efforts! Here is the breakdown of how we will be using the funds that are raised:
$4,446 - Flights to and from as well as within East Africa
$2,365 - Room and Board in Kenya, Uganda, and Democratic Republic of Congo
$795 - Visas - Kenya, Uganda Transit Visa, Democratic Republic of Congo
$775 - Ground Transportation 
$156 - Training and experiential learning opportunities
Total = $8,537Any money that we raise over our goal, or that goes unused during the trip, will go directly into the Y.E.C.A. Climate Fellows Fund, which will support our current and future cohorts of climate activists in the DR Congo.More important than the raising of funds for the trip is the support of your prayers. As a Christian organization, we at Y.E.C.A. believe that faithfully trusting in God’s providence is central to all of our initiatives.  Specifically for this trip, please pray for:
Safe travel for Y.E.C.A. steering committee members and the UCBC team
Strong friendships and partnerships to develop between members of different organizations and between people of varied backgrounds and nationalities
That we would be attentive listeners, receptive to the needs, wants, and questions of the UCBC team as they consider what it looks like to live as faithful stewards in their context
Humility and trust in God as the Y.E.C.A. and UCBC teams seek to address the increasingly immense issue of climate change

<p>Mon nom est Alexis de Tarade, je suis né en France d’une mère grecque et j’ai grandi aux États-Unis. J’ai travaillé dans les médias et la communication visuelle pendant plusieurs années mais au fil des ans j’ai commencé à me sentir de plus en plus concerné par l’écologie. Je ne suis pas un scientifique mais j’essaie de me servir de mes compétences en arts visuels et de ma motivation pour faire la différence. Je ne peux tout simplement plus supporter de juste me plaindre dans mon coin et regarder l’environnement se dégrader sans participer à sa sauvegarde. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436181128/qhoauw6beu9gtrfiaipu.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>Je me suis installé à Annecy il y a deux ans et j’ai voulu m’impliquer pour aider à garder le lac propre et préservé. J’ai été assez frustré de voir que les solutions actuelles de recyclages ou d’alimentation bio posent tout de même un problème environnementale à cause des emballages que ça génère et qui la plupart du temps finissent hors de la chaîne de tri avec les autres déchets. J’ai alors cherché la source du problème La réduction des emballages semble être une des solutions de base.<br/>En ville on peut facilement voir que les touristes comme les locaux achètent des bouteilles qui sont souvent remplis par de l’eau qui vient de la région, comme Evian par exemple. La qualité de l’eau courante à Annecy est comparable à l’eau minérale vendue dans le commerce, alors qu’elle est en libre accès et fraiche dans de nombreuses fontaines à travers la ville. La question qui se posait alors était « comment amener les gens à prendre l’habitude de ré-utiliser une bouteille en verre lorsqu’ils sont à Annecy ? » la Better Bottle est la réponse.<br/><br/>Les contributeurs au projet nous donnerons les moyens à mon équipe et moi pour produire la Better Bottle, une bouteille de type bouteille de limonade à l’ancienne à remplir aux points d’eau qui seront recensés sur une carte spécialement créée et distribuée avec la bouteille. On espère pas seulement distribuer les bouteilles mais aussi participer au nettoyage de la ville et des berges du lac pour s’assurer qu’une plus grande quantité des déchets de la ville puissent être recyclés.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436196812/halfcazixrwr6ddwx7lk.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>La carte:<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436178011/ghunn722dwliyk67uc7n.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>Recompenses au contribut:</h3>
<p>Nous espérons vraiment ne pas devoir dépendre de la vente des Better Bottle aux touristes. L’efficacité de cette campagne viendra du fait que nous offrirons les bouteilles aux gens. Qui dira non si c’est gratuit ? Nous seront ouverts aux dons, cela relève du choix des personnes mais pendant toute la durée de la campagne il y aura plusieurs sortes de goodies avec les logos Better Bottle à vendre, et selon la contribution Indiegogo, vous pourrez vous en voir offrir.

Même avec nos propres moyens, vélos, nous ferons notre possible pour produire et distribuer un maximum de bouteilles en collectant un maximum de déchets recyclables. À ce moment là nous serons forcés de faire un appel aux dons mais je crois que la clé du succès de ce projet se trouve dans la gratuité et la participation spontanée des gens à qui on offrira ces Better Bottle et que l’on pourra sensibiliser. L’eau doit rester gratuite.<p><span><br/></span>Nous pourrions également avoir recours au sponsoring de commerçants locaux qui pourraient acheter des encarts publicitaires sur le vélo et la carte des points d’eau mais TOUT les profits iront au projet et ne constitueront en aucun cas des revenus pour nous.</p>
<p>Si de l’argent venait à s’accumuler il sera reversé à des associations de protection de l’environnement comme la LPO (<a href=""http://www.birdlife.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.birdlife.org</a>) et la FRAPNA (<a href=""http://www.frapna.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.frapna.org</a>) qui travaillent pour apporter une eau propre aux populations.</p>
<h3>L’impact de la Better Bottle:<ul><li>
<p>On essaie de résoudre le problème des déchets à la source. Les produits recyclables doivent être triés et jetés aux bons endroits, hors on peut voir que même pour les gens qui sont sensibles aux recyclage et le pratique chez eux, une fois en ville ou loin de chez eux très peu font l’impasse car peu saven où recycler  et il devient difficile de garder les bonnes habitudes.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span></p>

Si vous aimez l’idée, ne vous gênez pour faire la même chose chez vous, nous serons heureux de vous aider.</p>
<p>Si vous n’avez pas d’argent pour participer au financement, vous avez toujours une voix et le partage de notre projet est déjà une bonne chose, et nous savons que vous avez une bouteille de verre vide chez vous, alors rejoignez le mouvement et buvez votre eau local et motivent tous les gents de remplacer les bouteilles en plastiques avec un Better Bottle!<br/><br/>N’hésitez pas à utiliser les outils de partage d’Indiegogo pour les réseaux sociaux.</p>

<ul>
<li>My name is Alexis de Tarade, born in France from a Greek mother and grew up in the USA. I have worked in media for many years but with age I have become more and more concerned about ecology. Since I am not a scientist I am trying to use my visual arts skills and self-motivation to help make a difference. I simply  cannot stand on the sidelines anymore complaining and watching the environment crumble without participating towards its salvation. I moved to Annecy two years ago and decided to do something to help keep the lake clean and pure.<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436181128/qhoauw6beu9gtrfiaipu.png"" src="""" style=""""/>I was frustrated with the current solutions such as organic food and recyclables since they often fall short of achieving a better planet due to their packaging. I wanted to get to the source of the problem and reduce the packaging being created in the first place. I noticed in town that locals and tourists were buying bottled water while living quite close from their source, like Evian. The water quality in town is comparable to bottled water and is offered free and fresh all over town via public fountains. The question was, ""How to get the people to acquire the habit of re-using a glass bottle while in Annecy?"". The <b>Better Bottle</b> was the answer.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The contributors towards the project will give us the means for my team and I to produce the <b>Better Bottle</b>, a glass lemonade bottle, to be distributed to the people and refilled at one of the many watering points marked on the map provided. We hope to not only distribute the bottles, but help clean up the lake and make sure more recyclable material is actually recycled.<span><br/></span><span><span></span></span></p>

Mon nom est Alexis de Tarade, je suis né en France d’une mère grecque et j’ai grandi aux États-Unis. J’ai travaillé dans les médias et la communication visuelle pendant plusieurs années mais au fil des ans j’ai commencé à me sentir de plus en plus concerné par l’écologie. Je ne suis pas un scientifique mais j’essaie de me servir de mes compétences en arts visuels et de ma motivation pour faire la différence. Je ne peux tout simplement plus supporter de juste me plaindre dans mon coin et regarder l’environnement se dégrader sans participer à sa sauvegarde. Je me suis installé à Annecy il y a deux ans et j’ai voulu m’impliquer pour aider à garder le lac propre et préservé. J’ai été assez frustré de voir que les solutions actuelles de recyclages ou d’alimentation bio posent tout de même un problème environnementale à cause des emballages que ça génère et qui la plupart du temps finissent hors de la chaîne de tri avec les autres déchets. J’ai alors cherché la source du problème La réduction des emballages semble être une des solutions de base.En ville on peut facilement voir que les touristes comme les locaux achètent des bouteilles qui sont souvent remplis par de l’eau qui vient de la région, comme Evian par exemple. La qualité de l’eau courante à Annecy est comparable à l’eau minérale vendue dans le commerce, alors qu’elle est en libre accès et fraiche dans de nombreuses fontaines à travers la ville. La question qui se posait alors était « comment amener les gens à prendre l’habitude de ré-utiliser une bouteille en verre lorsqu’ils sont à Annecy ? » la Better Bottle est la réponse.Les contributeurs au projet nous donnerons les moyens à mon équipe et moi pour produire la Better Bottle, une bouteille de type bouteille de limonade à l’ancienne à remplir aux points d’eau qui seront recensés sur une carte spécialement créée et distribuée avec la bouteille. On espère pas seulement distribuer les bouteilles mais aussi participer au nettoyage de la ville et des berges du lac pour s’assurer qu’une plus grande quantité des déchets de la ville puissent être recyclés.La carte:
Les Frais & comment nous aider: 
Nous avons besoin de au moins $3000  pour fabriquer 500 bouteilles, se procurer un bateau  de nettoyage et un vélo de facteur avec sa remorque pour transporter les déchets recyclables qu’on aura collecté. J’ai également intégré dans le calcul de l’argent pour rémunérer un minimum l’équipe de jeunes pour les longues journées au soleil passées à distribuer nos Better Bottle, à nettoyer les plages et à mettre les mains dans les poubelles.
Coûts:

500 Bottles (minimum production run) : $1000 Matériel et rémunération de l’équipe : 650 $Canoë 3 personnes d’occasion pour le nettoyage des fonds : 650 $Vélo de transport des bouteilles : 550 $

Frais Indiegogo : 350 $

Recompenses au contribut:
Nous espérons vraiment ne pas devoir dépendre de la vente des Better Bottle aux touristes. L’efficacité de cette campagne viendra du fait que nous offrirons les bouteilles aux gens. Qui dira non si c’est gratuit ? Nous seront ouverts aux dons, cela relève du choix des personnes mais pendant toute la durée de la campagne il y aura plusieurs sortes de goodies avec les logos Better Bottle à vendre, et selon la contribution Indiegogo, vous pourrez vous en voir offrir. (Nous vous contacterons par e-mail pour votre adresse postale pour envoyer les produits une fois que nous sommes prêts à expédier en Août.)
Autocollant Better Bottle:La Bouteille Better Bottle:Sac en Cotton Bio:

T-shirt en Cotton Bio:Même si nous n’atteignons pas notre but sur Indiegogo, le projet verra le jour quand même. Même avec nos propres moyens, vélos, nous ferons notre possible pour produire et distribuer un maximum de bouteilles en collectant un maximum de déchets recyclables. À ce moment là nous serons forcés de faire un appel aux dons mais je crois que la clé du succès de ce projet se trouve dans la gratuité et la participation spontanée des gens à qui on offrira ces Better Bottle et que l’on pourra sensibiliser. L’eau doit rester gratuite.Nous pourrions également avoir recours au sponsoring de commerçants locaux qui pourraient acheter des encarts publicitaires sur le vélo et la carte des points d’eau mais TOUT les profits iront au projet et ne constitueront en aucun cas des revenus pour nous.
Si de l’argent venait à s’accumuler il sera reversé à des associations de protection de l’environnement comme la LPO (www.birdlife.org) et la FRAPNA (www.frapna.org) qui travaillent pour apporter une eau propre aux populations.
L’impact de la Better Bottle:
On essaie de résoudre le problème des déchets à la source. Les produits recyclables doivent être triés et jetés aux bons endroits, hors on peut voir que même pour les gens qui sont sensibles aux recyclage et le pratique chez eux, une fois en ville ou loin de chez eux très peu font l’impasse car peu saven où recycler  et il devient difficile de garder les bonnes habitudes.
Une seule Better Bottle peut faire la différence pour une personne, il est facile d’imaginer la différence que cela ferait si l’on pouvait en produire 500 ou même plus !

Prochaine étape:


D’ici l’été prochain nous espérons rendre le projet Better Bottle officiel auprès de la Mairie d’Annecy, fort de son soutien et de celui des commerçants locaux le projet pourrait prendre de l’ampleur voire s’exporter dans d’autres endroits où l’on vit au bord de l’eau. Si vous aimez l’idée, ne vous gênez pour faire la même chose chez vous, nous serons heureux de vous aider.
Si vous n’avez pas d’argent pour participer au financement, vous avez toujours une voix et le partage de notre projet est déjà une bonne chose, et nous savons que vous avez une bouteille de verre vide chez vous, alors rejoignez le mouvement et buvez votre eau local et motivent tous les gents de remplacer les bouteilles en plastiques avec un Better Bottle!N’hésitez pas à utiliser les outils de partage d’Indiegogo pour les réseaux sociaux.
Un grand MERCI!-The Better Bottle Project

 The Better Bottle idea: (english version)

My name is Alexis de Tarade, born in France from a Greek mother and grew up in the USA. I have worked in media for many years but with age I have become more and more concerned about ecology. Since I am not a scientist I am trying to use my visual arts skills and self-motivation to help make a difference. I simply  cannot stand on the sidelines anymore complaining and watching the environment crumble without participating towards its salvation. I moved to Annecy two years ago and decided to do something to help keep the lake clean and pure.I was frustrated with the current solutions such as organic food and recyclables since they often fall short of achieving a better planet due to their packaging. I wanted to get to the source of the problem and reduce the packaging being created in the first place. I noticed in town that locals and tourists were buying bottled water while living quite close from their source, like Evian. The water quality in town is comparable to bottled water and is offered free and fresh all over town via public fountains. The question was, ""How to get the people to acquire the habit of re-using a glass bottle while in Annecy?"". The Better Bottle was the answer.The contributors towards the project will give us the means for my team and I to produce the Better Bottle, a glass lemonade bottle, to be distributed to the people and refilled at one of the many watering points marked on the map provided. We hope to not only distribute the bottles, but help clean up the lake and make sure more recyclable material is actually recycled.

The map:(the map will be updated with further information at the time of production)

   How to Help Us & Rewards:  
We will need be about $3000 to make at least 500 bottles, get the canoe for lake clean-ups and the bike/trailer to transport the recyclable goods that we collect and dispose of correctly. Then I have calculated some money to feed and provide some minimal renumeration to the small team for long days in the sun distributing bottles, cleaning up the beaches and digging through the trash. COSTS: 500 Bottles (minimum production run) : $1000 Materials & crew costs: $650 3 person second-hand canoe: $650Bottle transport vehicle: $550


Indiegogo Payment: $350 Rewards to our contributers:

 We are really hoping to not depend on finding funds by selling bottles to the tourists. The effectiveness of this campaign will be in the fact that we are offering the bottle to people. Who will say no to a free bottle of water? If they want to give us a donation, that will be their choice but we intend to gather funds by selling the goodies with Better Bottle graphics. (We will contact you via email for your mailing address once we are ready to ship all the goods in August.)Sticker:Bottle:

Organic Cotton Bag:

Organic Cotton T-shirt:

 Even if we fall short of our Indigogo goal, we are going to do this project anyway. It might just end up being us on our bikes riding around cleaning up what we can and making as many bottles that the money collected will allow us to make. At this point we will be obliged to ask for donations when we distribute the bottles, but we believe the success in the project will be if we can offer people the bottles and revenues can be made on shirts & bags instead. The water must remain FREE in Annecy.

Local businesses can buy advertisement to be place on the trailer of the bike and on the map but ALL profits will be only feeding back into the project and never to accumulate revenue. If any superfluous funds are accumulated we plan to donate it to local preservation societies like the LPO (www.birdlife.org) & FRAPNA (www.frapna.org) and efforts that are working to bring clean water to people. The Impact of The Better Bottle:We are trying to plug the trash problem at the source, plastic bottles. Recyclable packaging is in vain if they all end of in landfills because people don't bother to recycle or don't know where to recycle. Many people recycle and are mindful of the environment but when away from home on holidays it can be hard to keep their good habits.
1 Better Bottle can make such a difference with one person. Imagine the difference we can do with 500 bottles or even more!The Next Step:


   We hope to eventually approach the town of Annecy and try to make this project official and backed by the town and local commerces. We are only working through the second half of this summer but all the material will be used next year for the bigger better project with the support of the town, hopefully. The project can be exported to wherever bountiful clean water exists and to help keep it that way. If you you like the idea, feel free to launch it in your area. We will be happy to give you any suggestions.    If you don't have money to help, at least you a have voice:

We know you have a resealable empty glass bottle somewhere around your house so you can join the movement by drinking your local water. Let people know it's time we end the decades of plastics sitting in our soils and seas.

Who are We?
We are a team of professionals from different backgrounds. Silver Living Tech is a research business dedicated to researching nano-particles of silver colloidal in size. We have been working on setting things in place for this project for the last 3 years. Alexander (my dad) and I are both from Arequipa-Peru. We were born there, raised there, and have been working there helping make a difference in the lives of many by working with the Production Ministry of Peru and the Pyme Chamber. 
Despite the economic growth Peru has been experiencing during the last 5 years, something as basic as pure potable water is not available to everyone.

So, Are You a Non-Profit or a For-Profit Business?

We are a for-profit business.  Silver Living Tech is a research business dedicated to researching nano-particles of silver colloidal in size. All of our member have their own jobs or are retired, with the exception of Rene, who sold his restaurant in Peru when he moved back to the US to help establish the company there. 

Do You Have Experience Doing This Kind Of Projects?


Yes,  Peter Reynolds has chaired various projects funded by the National Science Foundation, development projects for WICAT Institute and the Waterford Institute. He also researched the nano-particles of silver colloidal in size back in 1991 with a fellow of the Graham Laboratories back when not much was understood about these nano-particles of silver.
Alexander Nunez has over 5 years of experience working with the Peruvian government through the Production Ministry and the PYME Chamber helping them implement their different programs aimed at helping people as well as businesses.
Rene Nunez has been working with the Production Ministry and the PYME Chamber since 2011 and is the International Operations Manager for Silver Living Tech SAC in Peru and the legal representative of the company in the US.
Erin Shea is the newest member who has been working with us almost for a year now. She has invaluable knowledge about humanitarian projects which will help us when we are in Peru.

Tell Us, What is The Problem You Have Again?
Peru's economy is growing rapidly, and together with this amazing economic growth there is also contamination and pollution. Our beautiful Chili river which once had trout and shrimp is now a soup of germs. 

90 percent of the sewage water from Arequipa Peru (a city of a little over 1 million people) goes straight into the Chili river untreated. The contaminated waters are then used by the locals (who do not know any better and because the water already come as they like to say ""fertilized"") to irrigate their crops. These crops are sold at the markets and people become infected and sick. 
Another problem we have is that many international markets (because of their safety concerns) are not importing our products, thus affecting the micro economies of the people. 30 percent of the people of Peru depend on agriculture as their main source of income.
So, What is Your Plan?
Our plan is to research the use of nanoparticles of silver colloidal in size in the water disinfection process of waste water purification.

How Do You Plan On Doing This?

We are going to bring Doctor Peter Reynolds and his son Engineer Ben Reynolds to Peru to help us research the use of our nanoparticles of silver in the waste water purification process. We will be working with the Catholic University of Santa Maria in Arequipa-Peru.

Why Not Use The Conventional Methods and Build a Water Treatment Plant With That Money?

The conventional waste water purification methods are too expensive for us in Peru, not to mention they are dangerous for the environment.  A water treatment plant costs millions of dollars, what we are trying to do here is bring about a new technology to reduce the cost of waste water treatment and the impact it has in the environment. Also, the FINCyT program is designed to promote research, under their regulations they cannot use that money for anything else.
Conventional treatments include the use of Chlorine as the main disinfectant. The problem with Chlorine is that very large amounts are needed to disinfect the water (expensive), chlorine will destroy the flora (plant life) and fauna (animal life) of the ecosystem of the Chili river and the pampas of Arequipa-Peru, after the chlorination process a dechlorination process must be put in place before releasing the water back to the river (very expensive method).
Other disinfection methods are not strong enough because of the high levels of contamination the river has or will take too long before producing the desired outcome.

Our method is the best option available

Doctor Peter Reynolds researched the Nanoparticles of silver colloidal in size back in 1991 and has a pretty good understanding of how they work. 
In his research, Peter found that there are certain characteristics that make these nanoparticles of silver safe for both animals and plants; in fact, they have the ability to promote their health. Together with his son Ben who works as one of their top engineers for the US Air Force, perfected the method to manufacture these nanoparticles of silver colloidal in size, making the process very cost effective.
Why Do You Need 150K?
Doing research is not cheap the 150K is only our 25 percent of the deal, the Peruvian government will fund the other 75 percent as long as we come up with our 25 percent.  We are bringing Peter and Ben Reynolds to Peru for at least 3 - 4 months, we will have professional from Peru, from the Catholic University of Santa Maria working with us as well.  After Peter and Ben return to the US, we will continue our research and finally present our findings to the commission in charge of reviewing the results from the projects they fund.We are also planning on continuing our efforts working with the Production Ministry and the PYME Chamber by educating micro, small and medium size businesses about the dangers of polluting the river waters, ways to implement responsible waste water disposal, and to help them as we have so far become more competitive in the international markets.

After that we will seek to implement the use of nano-particles of silver in the waste water disinfection and purification they do in Arequipa. If we are successful then we will take it to other parts of Peru and eventually the world.
So This Is What We Plan To Accomplish

Research how to use the nanoparticles of silver to disinfect the waters of the Chili river while maintaining the ecosystem.
Show the Peruvian government a new waste water purification method which is cost effective and which can be used all throughout Peru and maybe the world.
Present plans to build new water treatment plants which will use our nanoparticles of silver for their disinfection needs.
Take the new technology to other countries where it can help with their waste water treatment.

<h3>Two High Schools So Different</h3>
<p>California's Woodside High School has 2000 students. So does Tachilek High in Myanmar (Burma). But the two schools <i>could not be more differen</i>t.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <b>students and teachers in Myanmar</b> are drinking water from ancient wells and cisterns, using coffee filters to screen out sediment.</li>
<li>The <i>water is <b>contaminated</b></i> with bacteria and viruses.</li>
<li>
<b>Woodside High's Green Academy wants to provide water purification technology</b> to solve their drinking water issue for the next ten years.</li>
</ul>
<p>H2OpenDoors, a project of the two Rotary Clubs in Redwood City, California, is working with these schools to install a <b>SunSpring system in Myanmar in February of 201</b>4. Several students from Woodside will accompany the Rotarians on the installation expedition.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><b>We want to raise $30,000 by October 15th</b>, which will pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>One SunSpring Hybrid, powered by a wind turbine and solar panel, that will produce over <b><i>19,000 liters every day</i> of pure water</b> from any contaminated water source</li>
<li>Shipping of unit (about 1000 pounds) in a wooden crate that includes the complete system, spare parts and tools, and 150 pair of new Crocs shoes</li>
<li>
<i>A donation of $50 provides the equivalent of 40,000 gallons</i> of pure water produced from the Sunspring, enough for a family of 10 to have a gallon per person every day for ten years.<br/>
</li>
<li>If we fall short of the goal, all monies collected go towards the purchase, with other fundraising efforts required to make up the difference</li>
<li>If we exceed our goal, the funds will be used to help send students of families who cannot afford the airfare on the expedition with their teacher<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Imagine the power of students from a California High School presenting water purification technology to their peers in Myanmar, one of the poorest and most challenged countries on Earth.</p>
<ul>

California's Woodside High School has 2000 students. So does Tachilek High in Myanmar (Burma). But the two schools could not be more different.

The students and teachers in Myanmar are drinking water from ancient wells and cisterns, using coffee filters to screen out sediment.
The water is contaminated with bacteria and viruses.

Woodside High's Green Academy wants to provide water purification technology to solve their drinking water issue for the next ten years.

H2OpenDoors, a project of the two Rotary Clubs in Redwood City, California, is working with these schools to install a SunSpring system in Myanmar in February of 2014. Several students from Woodside will accompany the Rotarians on the installation expedition.


What We Need & What You Get
We want to raise $30,000 by October 15th, which will pay for:

One SunSpring Hybrid, powered by a wind turbine and solar panel, that will produce over 19,000 liters every day of pure water from any contaminated water source
Shipping of unit (about 1000 pounds) in a wooden crate that includes the complete system, spare parts and tools, and 150 pair of new Crocs shoes

A donation of $50 provides the equivalent of 40,000 gallons of pure water produced from the Sunspring, enough for a family of 10 to have a gallon per person every day for ten years.

If we fall short of the goal, all monies collected go towards the purchase, with other fundraising efforts required to make up the difference
If we exceed our goal, the funds will be used to help send students of families who cannot afford the airfare on the expedition with their teacher




The Impact
Imagine the power of students from a California High School presenting water purification technology to their peers in Myanmar, one of the poorest and most challenged countries on Earth.


Over 9000 people die every single day of waterborne disease, half of whom are children.
Contaminated water sources force these communities to spend up to half of what they earn each day on bottled water.
H2OpenDoors and Rotary provides the villages and schools the mentoring, monitoring and microfinancing to establish a social business where the surplus capacity can be sold.
The installation we just performed in a hill tribe community of 2500 was responsible for a 75% decrease in incidents of diarrhea in the first 5 months.

<h3>Why This Project is Important</h3>
<div>
<p>This research will provide
documentation of the types of pesticides and pathogens commonly encountered by
commercial beekeepers in agricultural areas over the course of a year, with a
focus on agricultural locations with almonds and corn—two crops that most U.S.
bees are exposed to. The work will also provide insights into the effects of combined pesticide exposure and pathogen levels on hive health over time.  We anticipate that we can use the data in a number of ways.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>At the regulatory level (US EPA), the research will provide data on which to base decision-making for pesticides to enhance pollinator protection.</li>
<li>For beekeepers, the study will provide a quantitative estimate of hazards posed by particular crop-pesticide combinations and will enable them, where possible, to
keep their bees away from such crops.</li>
<li>Growers and Regional IPM centers will be able to use the information to make pollinator-friendly choices when selecting pest control products for crops.</li>
<li>Knowing which factors are most closely associated with decreased colony fitness will enable everyone to focus pollinator protection efforts on the factors that are most important for improving bee health.</li>

<h3>The Technical Stuff</h3>
<p>OK, we know some of you want to know more . . . to dig in a little bit and find out about the science behind our work.  So here goes . . .</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Overview</b></p>
<p>Many causes for the unusually high managed honey bee colony
losses have been proposed, including pesticides, the <i>Varroa</i> mite, pathogens such as <i>Nosema</i>
and various viruses, and loss of forage due to increased corn production to
make biofuels. It is likely that an interactive combination of these stressors
is responsible for the observed colony declines. More study is needed to
determine the primary factor or mix of factors causing colony losses, with a
focus on combined effects. </p>
<p>Understanding the relative contribution of the different
factors to the problem of unsustainable colony losses is paramount to solving
it, yet few studies are focused on this outcome. The PSC-PRI Hive Tracking
Project will provide unique and valuable insights into the agricultural
landscape in the U.S. and its effects on pollinators by evaluating multiple
colony stressors and their interactions in commercial managed honey bee
colonies. </p>
<p>Previous work in this area has laid the groundwork for doing
this study, showing the necessity of tracking the multiple parameters that may
affect colony health. Van Englesdorp <i>et
al. </i>conducted a comparison of multiple stressors (pesticides, pathogens,
and parasites) on collapsed colonies <i>vs</i>
healthy colonies<a href=""#_edn1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>[i]</span></a> at a single point in time, finding
no single factor that explained the differences. Runckel, Flenniken, <i>et al.</i> tracked pathogen loads for a
migratory bee operation, assessing their changes over time and correlations to
colony health, but did not measure pesticide residues.<a href=""#_edn2"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>[ii]</span></a>, <span><span><a href=""#_edn3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[iii]</a> </span></span><span>Flenniken and Andino have also studied the honey bee
antiviral immune response,</span><a href=""#_edn4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[iv]</a><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">
an essential piece of the puzzle for understanding potential interactions
between exposure to immune-suppressing pesticides and a colony’s ability to
combat pathogens.</span></p>
<p>To date, there has been no prospective study that tracks
temporal changes in pesticide residues, pathogen loads, and parasites in a
migratory beekeeping operation, yet there is great potential to obtain data
that will help untangle the role of multiple stressors on the bees. Ultimately,
this work will provide data to inform evidence-based decisions regarding
pesticide regulation, in order to better protect pollinators. The U.S.
regulatory system is in dire need of such data, and a major part of the
outreach efforts for dissemination of project results will focus on US EPA, USDA,
the CA Department of Pesticide Regulation, and other Departments of Agriculture
in states around the U.S. This study will provide data to document the scope
and magnitude of agrochemical levels within managed honey bee colonies in
agricultural areas—an essential first step to understanding the issue and
providing a scientific basis for any needed regulatory change. </p>
<p><b>The Role of Pesticides
in Pollinator Declines</b></p>
<p>Current agricultural systems are reliant on chemical inputs,
many of which are toxic to bees and other pollinators and present in the
environments they frequent. Thus, agrochemicals are one factor that may
contribute to colony losses. Systemic, persistent pesticides—insecticides and
fungicides—are among the primary suspects in the recent colony losses. These
pesticides are sufficiently water soluble to be taken up through the roots
and/or leaves of plants and translocated throughout the plant, including into
the pollen and nectar on which bees feed. Their persistence ensures that the
plant retains levels of the pesticide that may be toxic to pollinators for long
periods of time—months for annual crops to years for perennial crops. </p>
<p>Acute bee-kills are the most obvious form of harm caused by agrochemicals,
but lower levels of pesticide exposure can also cause a decrease in hive
strength or even colony failure by altering honey bee behaviors and impairing
the immune response. A recent study demonstrated that field level exposure to one
of the systemic neonicotinoid insecticides (imidacloprid) adversely affected
the pollen-collecting efficiency of worker bees, leading to reductions in brood
development and colony success.<a href=""#_edn5"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>[v]</span></a> Homing failure following
low-level thiamethoxam exposure has also been observed in field experiments
using honey bees.<a href=""#_edn6"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>[vi]</span></a>
Other studies have shown that honey bees exhibit reduced activity levels,<a href=""#_edn7"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>[vii]</span></a> short- and long-term
memory impairment,<a href=""#_edn8"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>[viii]</span></a>,
<a href=""#_edn9"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span>[ix]</span></span></a> and reduced ability
to recruit foragers by waggle dancing following pesticide exposure.<a href=""#_edn10"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>[x]</span></a> </p>
<p>Dietary exposure to neonicotinoids has been shown to impair
the reproductive capacities of both bumble bees and solitary bees. One study
found that imidacloprid doses as low as 1 mg/L in sucrose solution
significantly reduced bumble bee brood production.<a href=""#_edn11"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>[xi]</span></a>
These results suggest that neonicotinoid exposure diminishes bumble bee queen
fertility; however, reduced feeding activity in neonicotinoid treated bees was
also observed, providing an alternative explanation for the diminished
fecundity rates. Bumble bee colonies foraging for six days on clover in turf
treated with a clothianidin grub-control product at label rates not only
experienced bee kills, but the surviving bees produced no queens.<a href=""#_edn12"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>[xii]</span></a>
Chronically exposed bumble bee colonies have also shown substantial (as high as
85 percent) reduction in the production of new queens, thus creating an
enormous barrier to colony propagation.<a href=""#_edn13"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>[xiii]</span></a>
Although no effects were observed on adult solitary bee mortality, sublethal
exposure to less than 3.5 mg/kg of a neonicotinoid mixture (thiamethoxam plus
clothianidin) in sugar solution decreased the nest building and brood cell
construction rates.<a href=""#_edn14"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>[xiv]</span></a>
Offspring production in the treatment group was reduced by almost 50 percent.</p>
<p>Recent work by Sandrock <i>et
al.</i><a href=""#_edn15"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>[xv]</span></a>
indicates that neonicotinoid pesticides may also have effects on reproduction
in honey bee colonies, through effects on foraging efficiency and queen survival.
Colonies that were fed pollen containing field-realistic levels of thiamethoxam
and clothianidin (5.31 mg/kg and
2.05 mg/kg, respectively) gathered 19%
less pollen on average than control colonies (P=0.01). While both the control
and treatment groups collected similar amounts of pollen during the first three
weeks of the experimental pollen feeding, colonies exposed to thiamethoxam and
clothianidin consistently collected less pollen later on, with mean pollen
collections barely reaching more than 50% of the control group during the last
week of exposure. In this study, there was also a significant association
between neonicotinoid exposure and queen supersedure,  with six out of 10 queens in the treatment
colonies being superseded within one year of treatment, compared to zero out of
10 queens in the control colonies (P=0.01). Swarming, an event that is critical
to colony reproduction was also statistically significantly lower in
neonicotinoid-treated colonies in the spring following treatment (P=0.005). Exposure
to mixtures of pesticides in hive matrices (pollen, honey, and wax) is common,<a href=""#_edn16"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>[xvi]</span></a>,
<a href=""#_edn17"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span>[xvii]</span></span></a>
and our results to date reinforce these findings. Synergistic effects of some
pesticides have been studied,<a href=""#_edn18"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>[xviii]</span></a>,
<a href=""#_edn19"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span>[xix]</span></span></a>,
<a href=""#_edn20"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span>[xx]</span></span></a>
but much remains to be done to understand the toxic effects of agrochemical mixtures.</p>
<p>Effects on the immune system have
also been observed (see below).</p>
<p><a rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>The

<p>The most significant CCD-associated variable characterized to date
is increased pathogen incidence.<a href=""#_edn21"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>[xxi]</span></a> Although greater pathogen
incidence correlates with CCD, the cause is unknown in part due to insufficient

<p>Viral infections in bees can remain asymptomatic, or cause
deformities, paralysis and/or death. Symptoms associated with specific viruses
include wing deformities (DWV), hairless, dark, shiny bees (CBPV), swollen
yellow larva and/or dark-brown larva carcasses in the cells of worker-bees

<p><b>How Pesticides and
Pathogens Interact</b></p>
<p>A functional immune system is critical for honey bee survival,
but exposure to certain pesticides may impair bee immunity and result in
increased vulnerability to pathogens. Several insecticides<a href=""#_edn59"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>[lix]</span></a>,<a href=""#_edn60"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>[lx]</span></a>, <a href=""#_edn61"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>[lxi]</span></a>  and fungicides<a href=""#_edn62"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>[lxii]</span></a> have been found to
weaken the immune response in honey bees. This is particularly devastating to
colonies when <i>Varroa</i> mites are
present, since they transmit pathogens from bee to bee. A recent study examined
the molecular biology responsible for this impaired immune response and found
that exposure to the systemic insecticides imidacloprid and clothianidin
resulted in impaired immune signaling involved in antiviral responses.<a href=""#_edn63"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>[lxiii]</span></a> </p>
<p></p>
<p>Learning more about these interactions is critical to solving
the problems of unsustainable colony losses. This project will contribute to our
understanding of the science, and provide insights into pollinator-protective solutions.</p>
<p><b>Data Analysis</b></p>
<p><b>1) Principal Component
Analysis:</b> PRI will utilize Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and regression tree analysis to conduct a
multivariate exploratory data analysis of hive strength and survival as a
function of the following variables:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>Concentration of each pesticide and combinations
of pesticides. In particular, we will evaluate combinations of pesticides known
to interact synergistically to enhance overall toxicity, such as the Ergosterol
Biosynthesis Inhibitor (EBI) fungicides in the presence of certain
insecticides.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span>Presence/absence of pathogens and combinations
of pathogen loads with pesticide residues.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span>Total load of pesticides according to mechanism
of action, to enable visualization of trends that may be related to synergism,
and/or induced metabolic changes that may disable detoxification pathways.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will evaluate which of the measured parameters or
combination of parameters are most highly correlated with colony success or
failure. </p>
<p><b>2) Lethality Loading: </b>In
order to more fully understand the effects of mixtures of agrochemicals on
honey bee colonies, we will assess what we call the Lethality Loading of the
pollen, in terms of oral LD<sub>50</sub> equivalents detected in the colony,
based on typical pollen consumption for a nurse bee. This builds on Stoner and
Eitzer’s use of Pollen Hazard Quotients<a href=""#_edn64"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>[lxiv]</span></a> to evaluate pesticide
residues in pollen, but takes the analysis a step further to account for all
residues present in the hive. For pesticides for which oral LD<sub>50</sub>
values are not available, we will use contact LD<sub>50 </sub>values. Where data
are available, we will account for changes in the LD<sub>50</sub> values due to
synergistic effects, as per the method described by Sanchez-Bayo.<a href=""#_edn65"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>[lxv]</span></a></p>
<p><b>3) Comparison to
predicted colony growth:</b> Because the population of a colony is not static,
colony strength on a specific date will be compared to predicted strengths
based on population models. Several models of varying levels of sophistication
and data input needs have been developed and are summarized by Becher <i>et al.<a href=""#_edn66"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>[lxvi]</span></a></i>
including BEEPOP and derivatives thereof,<a href=""#_edn67"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>[lxvii]</span></a>, <a href=""#_edn68"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span>[lxviii]</span></span></a> the BEEHAVE

of the available bee population models for our particular data set and utilize
one or more of them to compare the observed changes in colony strength to that predicted

Mark your donation for the Hive Tracking ProjectYes, bees are making this choice every day, and not by their own free will! The bees are in trouble. We want to find out why. Counting both summer and winter losses, beekeepers are losing about 50% of their colonies each year. 2014 has been particularly devastating for Midwest beekeepers. We humans are losing our field force for pollinating the fruits and vegetables we all depend on for a healthy diet.  We need to stop the downhill slide! To do that, we need to untangle the different factors that may be affecting the bees. We are focusing on evaluating the effects of pesticides, pathogens, and combinations of the two on honey bee survival.



What Is the Project?


Pesticide Research Institute (PRI) and Pollinator Stewardship Council (PSC) are working together to better understand how different stressors (pesticides, pathogens) affect bees' ability to thrive. Scientists from PRI and commercial beekeepers from PSC are working together to track 60 beehives over the course of a year and making measurements of:




Pesticide residues in pollen, wax and honey (180 different pesticides)


Pollen identification (to see what the bees are foraging on)


Pathogen levels (in collaboration with Montana State University scientists)


Varroa mite loads


Hive strength, queen performance, disease, bee mortality, and any abnormal bee behavior




We started the work in January, 2014 and have collected 4 out of 5 sample sets. We have made hive strength measurements and observations at regular intervals over the course of the year. The preliminary results are tantalizing, but definitive conclusions will require finalizing the sample analysis and then doing some serious number-crunching. We need your help to finish this project!


What We Need
We need funding to run our fourth and fifth batches of samples and help with the data analysis. At $332 per sample times 60 hives times two sample runs, it adds up fast. If we don't reach our funding goal, your help will at least make a significant contribution. 
If we exceed our fundraising goal, any extra funds will go towards running additional samples to improve the statistics, and help the Pollinator Stewardship Council, a non-profit 501(c)(3) continue its important work helping the bees.

What You Get


We have a wide variety of gifts to thank you for your generosity, from an app that will help you make good pest management decisions to a visit and presentation from one of our staff. We hope you will also feel good about helping the bees—more than ever, they need you! 




If you don't have the resources to donate now, you can still help by getting the word out. Please post this on your Facebook page and forward to your friends using the IndieGoGo share tools. We appreciate any support you can give—Thank you!



Why This Project is Important

This research will provide
documentation of the types of pesticides and pathogens commonly encountered by
commercial beekeepers in agricultural areas over the course of a year, with a
focus on agricultural locations with almonds and corn—two crops that most U.S.
bees are exposed to. The work will also provide insights into the effects of combined pesticide exposure and pathogen levels on hive health over time.  We anticipate that we can use the data in a number of ways.


At the regulatory level (US EPA), the research will provide data on which to base decision-making for pesticides to enhance pollinator protection.
For beekeepers, the study will provide a quantitative estimate of hazards posed by particular crop-pesticide combinations and will enable them, where possible, to
keep their bees away from such crops.
Growers and Regional IPM centers will be able to use the information to make pollinator-friendly choices when selecting pest control products for crops.
Knowing which factors are most closely associated with decreased colony fitness will enable everyone to focus pollinator protection efforts on the factors that are most important for improving bee health.


Why PRI and PSC?
Pesticide Research Institute is an environmental consulting company headed by Susan Kegley, a PhD chemist who has been doing environmental chemistry for 25 years, with a focus on pesticides for the last 15 years. PRI develops information tools to better understand the risks of pesticides, does sampling for pesticides in air, water, and beehives, develops risk assessment models, and works with a number of non-profits to provide scientific support for their work. PRI has donated its staff time to develop the sampling procedures, help with the field sampling work, create a database that will help us organize and understand the data, and coordinate sampling events and project communications. PRI will be responsible for doing the final data analysis.
Pollinator Stewardship Council (formerly known as the National Pollinator Defense Fund) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded by commercial beekeepers to defend managed and native pollinators vital to a sustainable and affordable food supply from the adverse impact of pesticides. PSC provides beekeeper support for reporting pesticide-related bee-kills and keeps tabs on what US EPA is doing with regards to pesticide policies, contributing beekeeper voices to the decision-making process. PSC beekeepers, staff and colleagues are contributing their time and hives to the study, doing the field sampling work, and making regular hive health assessments. Coming from second, third, and fourth-generation beekeeping families, our three participating beekeepers have over 100 combined years of beekeeping experience.
The Technical Stuff
OK, we know some of you want to know more . . . to dig in a little bit and find out about the science behind our work.  So here goes . . .


Overview
Many causes for the unusually high managed honey bee colony
losses have been proposed, including pesticides, the Varroa mite, pathogens such as Nosema
and various viruses, and loss of forage due to increased corn production to
make biofuels. It is likely that an interactive combination of these stressors
is responsible for the observed colony declines. More study is needed to
determine the primary factor or mix of factors causing colony losses, with a
focus on combined effects. 
Understanding the relative contribution of the different
factors to the problem of unsustainable colony losses is paramount to solving
it, yet few studies are focused on this outcome. The PSC-PRI Hive Tracking
Project will provide unique and valuable insights into the agricultural
landscape in the U.S. and its effects on pollinators by evaluating multiple
colony stressors and their interactions in commercial managed honey bee
colonies. 
Previous work in this area has laid the groundwork for doing
this study, showing the necessity of tracking the multiple parameters that may
affect colony health. Van Englesdorp et
al. conducted a comparison of multiple stressors (pesticides, pathogens,
and parasites) on collapsed colonies vs
healthy colonies[i] at a single point in time, finding
no single factor that explained the differences. Runckel, Flenniken, et al. tracked pathogen loads for a
migratory bee operation, assessing their changes over time and correlations to
colony health, but did not measure pesticide residues.[ii], [iii] Flenniken and Andino have also studied the honey bee
antiviral immune response,[iv]
an essential piece of the puzzle for understanding potential interactions
between exposure to immune-suppressing pesticides and a colony’s ability to
combat pathogens.
To date, there has been no prospective study that tracks
temporal changes in pesticide residues, pathogen loads, and parasites in a
migratory beekeeping operation, yet there is great potential to obtain data
that will help untangle the role of multiple stressors on the bees. Ultimately,
this work will provide data to inform evidence-based decisions regarding
pesticide regulation, in order to better protect pollinators. The U.S.
regulatory system is in dire need of such data, and a major part of the
outreach efforts for dissemination of project results will focus on US EPA, USDA,
the CA Department of Pesticide Regulation, and other Departments of Agriculture
in states around the U.S. This study will provide data to document the scope
and magnitude of agrochemical levels within managed honey bee colonies in
agricultural areas—an essential first step to understanding the issue and
providing a scientific basis for any needed regulatory change. 
The Role of Pesticides
in Pollinator Declines
Current agricultural systems are reliant on chemical inputs,
many of which are toxic to bees and other pollinators and present in the
environments they frequent. Thus, agrochemicals are one factor that may
contribute to colony losses. Systemic, persistent pesticides—insecticides and
fungicides—are among the primary suspects in the recent colony losses. These
pesticides are sufficiently water soluble to be taken up through the roots
and/or leaves of plants and translocated throughout the plant, including into
the pollen and nectar on which bees feed. Their persistence ensures that the
plant retains levels of the pesticide that may be toxic to pollinators for long
periods of time—months for annual crops to years for perennial crops. 
Acute bee-kills are the most obvious form of harm caused by agrochemicals,
but lower levels of pesticide exposure can also cause a decrease in hive
strength or even colony failure by altering honey bee behaviors and impairing
the immune response. A recent study demonstrated that field level exposure to one
of the systemic neonicotinoid insecticides (imidacloprid) adversely affected
the pollen-collecting efficiency of worker bees, leading to reductions in brood
development and colony success.[v] Homing failure following
low-level thiamethoxam exposure has also been observed in field experiments
using honey bees.[vi]
Other studies have shown that honey bees exhibit reduced activity levels,[vii] short- and long-term
memory impairment,[viii],
[ix] and reduced ability
to recruit foragers by waggle dancing following pesticide exposure.[x] 
Dietary exposure to neonicotinoids has been shown to impair
the reproductive capacities of both bumble bees and solitary bees. One study
found that imidacloprid doses as low as 1 mg/L in sucrose solution
significantly reduced bumble bee brood production.[xi]
These results suggest that neonicotinoid exposure diminishes bumble bee queen
fertility; however, reduced feeding activity in neonicotinoid treated bees was
also observed, providing an alternative explanation for the diminished
fecundity rates. Bumble bee colonies foraging for six days on clover in turf
treated with a clothianidin grub-control product at label rates not only
experienced bee kills, but the surviving bees produced no queens.[xii]
Chronically exposed bumble bee colonies have also shown substantial (as high as
85 percent) reduction in the production of new queens, thus creating an
enormous barrier to colony propagation.[xiii]
Although no effects were observed on adult solitary bee mortality, sublethal
exposure to less than 3.5 mg/kg of a neonicotinoid mixture (thiamethoxam plus
clothianidin) in sugar solution decreased the nest building and brood cell
construction rates.[xiv]
Offspring production in the treatment group was reduced by almost 50 percent.
Recent work by Sandrock et
al.[xv]
indicates that neonicotinoid pesticides may also have effects on reproduction
in honey bee colonies, through effects on foraging efficiency and queen survival.
Colonies that were fed pollen containing field-realistic levels of thiamethoxam
and clothianidin (5.31 mg/kg and
2.05 mg/kg, respectively) gathered 19%
less pollen on average than control colonies (P=0.01). While both the control
and treatment groups collected similar amounts of pollen during the first three
weeks of the experimental pollen feeding, colonies exposed to thiamethoxam and
clothianidin consistently collected less pollen later on, with mean pollen
collections barely reaching more than 50% of the control group during the last
week of exposure. In this study, there was also a significant association
between neonicotinoid exposure and queen supersedure,  with six out of 10 queens in the treatment
colonies being superseded within one year of treatment, compared to zero out of
10 queens in the control colonies (P=0.01). Swarming, an event that is critical
to colony reproduction was also statistically significantly lower in
neonicotinoid-treated colonies in the spring following treatment (P=0.005). Exposure
to mixtures of pesticides in hive matrices (pollen, honey, and wax) is common,[xvi],
[xvii]
and our results to date reinforce these findings. Synergistic effects of some
pesticides have been studied,[xviii],
[xix],
[xx]
but much remains to be done to understand the toxic effects of agrochemical mixtures.
Effects on the immune system have
also been observed (see below).
The
Role of Pests and Pathogens in Pollinator Declines
The most significant CCD-associated variable characterized to date
is increased pathogen incidence.[xxi] Although greater pathogen
incidence correlates with CCD, the cause is unknown in part due to insufficient
knowledge of the pathogenic and commensal organisms associated with honey bees.[xxii]
Parasitic threats to honey bee colonies include viruses, Nosema, bacteria, and Crithidia. The majority of honey bee
infecting viruses are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses of the Picornavirales
order. They include acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV),[xxiii] black queen cell virus
(BQCV),[xxiv] Israeli acute bee
paralysis virus (IAPV),[xxv] Kashmir bee virus (KBV),[xxvi]  deformed wing virus (DWV),[xxvii] sacbrood virus (SBV),[xxviii] and chronic bee
paralysis virus (CBPV).[xxix], [xxx]  
Viral infections in bees can remain asymptomatic, or cause
deformities, paralysis and/or death. Symptoms associated with specific viruses
include wing deformities (DWV), hairless, dark, shiny bees (CBPV), swollen
yellow larva and/or dark-brown larva carcasses in the cells of worker-bees
(SBV) or queen-bees (BQCV). Bees frequently test positive for one or more
viruses. [xxxi],
[xxxii], [xxxiii]
In addition to viral infections, honey bees are also readily
parasitized by the microsporidia Nosema. [xxxiv], [xxxv] Historically U.S. honey bees were
predominantly infected by Nosema apis,
but recently Nosema ceranae
infections dominate. [xxxvi],
[xxxvii] The effects of Nosema infection on individual bee and
colony health are unclear. [xxxviii],[xxxix] Some reports suggest infections
decrease longevity and may lead to collapse,[xl], [xli],[xlii] but since Nosema is widespread and often detected
in healthy colonies, its role in colony health requires further investigation. [xliii], [xliv],[xlv] Another fungal
pathogen Ascophaera apis, the
causative agent of Chalkbrood disease, kills infected larvae, but does not
typically cause colony loss.[xlvi], [xlvii] Bacterial pathogens of
honey bees include Paenibacillus
larvae and Melissococcus plutonius,
the causative agents of American and European Foulbrood disease.[xlviii], [xlix], [l], [li]
Mite infestations (Ararapis
woodi, Tropilaelaps sp., and Varroa destructor) are
also common, weakening honey bee colonies.[lii], [liii] Introduction of V. destructor mites, which feed on the
hemolymph of developing honey bees and transmit viruses (DWV, KBV, IAPV), in
the late 1980s was devastating to the U.S. honey bee population.[liv], [lv], [lvi] Notably, the restricted
genetic diversity of the U.S. honey bee population may make it particularly
susceptible to catastrophic and episodic losses.[lvii], [lviii]
How Pesticides and
Pathogens Interact
A functional immune system is critical for honey bee survival,
but exposure to certain pesticides may impair bee immunity and result in
increased vulnerability to pathogens. Several insecticides[lix],[lx], [lxi]  and fungicides[lxii] have been found to
weaken the immune response in honey bees. This is particularly devastating to
colonies when Varroa mites are
present, since they transmit pathogens from bee to bee. A recent study examined
the molecular biology responsible for this impaired immune response and found
that exposure to the systemic insecticides imidacloprid and clothianidin
resulted in impaired immune signaling involved in antiviral responses.[lxiii] 

Learning more about these interactions is critical to solving
the problems of unsustainable colony losses. This project will contribute to our
understanding of the science, and provide insights into pollinator-protective solutions.
Data Analysis
1) Principal Component
Analysis: PRI will utilize Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and regression tree analysis to conduct a
multivariate exploratory data analysis of hive strength and survival as a
function of the following variables:



Concentration of each pesticide and combinations
of pesticides. In particular, we will evaluate combinations of pesticides known
to interact synergistically to enhance overall toxicity, such as the Ergosterol
Biosynthesis Inhibitor (EBI) fungicides in the presence of certain
insecticides.


Presence/absence of pathogens and combinations
of pathogen loads with pesticide residues.


Total load of pesticides according to mechanism
of action, to enable visualization of trends that may be related to synergism,
and/or induced metabolic changes that may disable detoxification pathways.


We will evaluate which of the measured parameters or
combination of parameters are most highly correlated with colony success or
failure. 
2) Lethality Loading: In
order to more fully understand the effects of mixtures of agrochemicals on
honey bee colonies, we will assess what we call the Lethality Loading of the
pollen, in terms of oral LD50 equivalents detected in the colony,
based on typical pollen consumption for a nurse bee. This builds on Stoner and
Eitzer’s use of Pollen Hazard Quotients[lxiv] to evaluate pesticide
residues in pollen, but takes the analysis a step further to account for all
residues present in the hive. For pesticides for which oral LD50
values are not available, we will use contact LD50 values. Where data
are available, we will account for changes in the LD50 values due to
synergistic effects, as per the method described by Sanchez-Bayo.[lxv]
3) Comparison to
predicted colony growth: Because the population of a colony is not static,
colony strength on a specific date will be compared to predicted strengths
based on population models. Several models of varying levels of sophistication
and data input needs have been developed and are summarized by Becher et al.[lxvi]
including BEEPOP and derivatives thereof,[lxvii], [lxviii] the BEEHAVE
model,[lxix] HoPoMo,[lxx] and the Khoury model.[lxxi] We will evaluate the suitability
of the available bee population models for our particular data set and utilize
one or more of them to compare the observed changes in colony strength to that predicted
by the model.
4) Comparison of
pesticide use during almond bloom across counties: We will use the
California Pesticide Use Reporting (PUR) data to evaluate historic agrochemical
use during the almond bloom, to evaluate cross-county differences in pest
management approaches, as an informational tool for growers.
