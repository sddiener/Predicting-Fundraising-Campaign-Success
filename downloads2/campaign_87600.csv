<p>We're Asian Pop Addict. We're 3 female radio DJ's based out of Miami exposing the world to the awesomeness that is Asian music. We started our journey almost 3 years ago when we noticed that there weren't many fan made radio programs out there talking about not just the music that was being released but also giving the news, gossip, &amp; breakdown of everything going on in the Asian scene. We pride ourselves on being real &amp; straight forward with our thoughts and opinions. We are very much uncensored which we find a lot of people like us could relate to because we run the show the way we want and don't hold back on anything. Yes, we're only 3 years old but we have accomplished so much in just a few years. We have from fans in over 30 different countries around the world. We've held exclusive interviews with not only musical artist but with people who are close to your favorite celebrities such as choreographers, who give us all the behind the scenes details about your favorite artist.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Our Problem</span></strong></p>
<p>One of the DJ's, Cyn works for a radio station but the studio they usual regularly has now become an issue because at the moment when APOPA needs it, it's either being used or it's out of order. This affects APOPA in pushing out a new show weekly which keeps the listeners unhappy. We love our listeners. They give us life in wanting to get better, in wanting to continue doing this show even though we don't get paid for it. We do this show because we LOVE IT! We would hate to see the day this show stops. There is no one out there like us. Don't let APOPA die. </p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What We Need</span></strong></p>
<p>Here's the breakdown of what we need. </p>
<p>*Mixer</p>
<p>*Compressor</p>
<p>*Headphone amp</p>
<p>*3 or 4 Microphone Stands</p>
<p>*3 or 4 Microphones</p>
<p>*Wiring</p>
<p>*T drive</p>
<p>*PC Computer (For basic recording. Nothing fancy.) </p>
<p>*Desk</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, we are Michael, Erik, and Ricky and together we make Eets Feats which is a surfy punk band based out of Austin, TX that has been together for over 3 years and has toured around the U.S.. Together all 3 of us have also started a music and art label/collective called Aye Aye Aye Tapes Escapes that we've used to release all of our music as well as other bands from America and France. We are currently raising money for our first 12"" vinyl release for Eets Feats and as you may have guessed, it's super expensive so we need your help! By donating, you will make it possible for us to release a rad record for all of your turntable needles to groove on and it will also help us realize our dream of putting out an Eets Feats record on 12"" wax. With this record release we are also hoping to use the money made from the record sales to continue to put out other projects in the future on Aye Aye Aye.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We are co releasing this record with Threadpull Records which is a fellow local label in Austin so we only need to raise half of expenses for pressing and promotions. With all that donate you will be guaranteed a record and will also receive all kinds of good goods made by our hands and delivered to yours. Any contributions will help immensely and even if we don't reach the goal it is still money that will all go towards our goal of releasing this record this fall.</p>
<p>This campaign will fund:</p>
<p>$1500 for pressing the vinyl </p>
<p>$600 for pressing the jackets</p>
<p>$150 for shipping of these materials.</p>

<h3>Kirtana Americana<br/>
</h3>
<br/>hello friends.  I am a world beat music artist who has been involved in spiritual music for almost 20 years. I perform at festivals, gatherings and yoga studios and am getting ready to put out a new cd  that mixes east and west in a funky new way.<br/>     The recording, which I've named Kirtana Americana, is already complete. I recorded it in a famous studio called the Power Station and the music features really amazing musicians I've worked with over the years. Some of these musicians include Tony Levin ( Peter Gabriel , King Crimson ),  JT Thomas ( Bruce Hornsby band ) Visvambhar 'Vish' Sheth ( the Mayapuris ) and Ron Holloway ( Govt Mule/Allman bros).  Needless to say , making this CD was a labor of Love.  I'm really happy the way it turned out, and if you like Kirtan music, I'd describe it as a rocking and live sounding recording that features amazing musicians. I did not 'edit it to perfection' or cut and paste loops of a few measures, it is not guided by a click track. we recorded most of it Live, so it has a lot of soul.<br/><br/>this is the first time I have tried to use crowd funding for one of my recordings. I am not working with any corporations or trying to fit into a certain 'sound' that fits a style or genre.  It is a very original recording that was made for my friends, family and lovers of yoga music performed by great players.<br/><br/>Also, this CD really features Visvambhar 'Vish' Sheth, the bandleader of the Mayapuris.  He drums beautifully ( a master of the mridangam ), sings and plays harmonium. I believe in supporting younger musicians in their process and Vish is one of the greatest, most sincere, musicians/devotees in the modern Kirtan movement, it is  my great honor to be able to feature his playing and Bhav.<br/><br/>I am also very happy with the audio quality of this recording. The Power Station, where it was recorded, is a famous studio that is owned by legendary producer Tony Bongiovi. Spending a few moments in the studio with him was a dream come true. His engineers were first class and it was inspiring to record on the same equipment that was used in the past by some of the most famous recordings in Rock History.<br/>Mics that Sinatra used, great from Motown, etc.  A Studio geek like me was in audio heaven.<br/><br/>Between the key players and engineers; the total experience represents hundreds of years of playing, performing and mixing. All this dedicated to celebrating the divine name with music and love. Even my Guruji, Dr Deepak Kapoor, phoned in a blessing, around which we created a cool track . I hope you choose to endorse this recording by contributing something to this effort.<br/><br/><br/><p></p>

<p>I believe music inspires us to higher heights and brighter futures.  <span>And music can document and change how we interact with each other as creators and collaborators.  </span></p>
<p>I am J. Plunky Branch, saxophonist, producer, band leader and songwriter.<span>  My career spans over 40 years, during which time I have performed countless gigs, toured the world, lectured, mentored, written over 400 songs and produced and released 25 albums.</span></p>
<p>My mission is to create music that is a bridge between past and future, music that creates new possibilities; and then to take that music to the people via touring and<br/>exposure through various media. </p>
<p>I am seeking your support in a campaign to raise funds to manufacture and market my new CD album, <i>NEVER TOO LATE</i>.  <em>(Look at the benefit levels over on the right)</em></p>
<p><strong>My History</strong></p>
<p>In 1967, while a student at Columbia University in New York City I formed my first band called the Soul Syndicate, a rhythm and blues group that was described as “14 pieces of driving soul.”<span>  After leaving college I migrated to San Francisco where I performed with a South African Musician, Ndikho Xaba, for three years.  In 1972, I formed Juju, a band dedicated to performing acoustic avant garde jazz blended with<br/>traditional African and Afro-Cuban rhythms. </span></p>
<p>Over the years my group evolved through name changes (from Oneness of Juju to Plunky &amp; Oneness) and several incarnations,while exploring various genres and combinationsof Black music, including: R&amp;B, jazz, funk, neo-soul, Afro-beat, go-go, reggae, and hip-hop.  In recent years several of our recordings from the 1970’s and 80’s have been re-issued by European and Japanese labels, re-mixed by rare groove deejays and, sampled by US hip-hop producers and rappers looking for unique rhythms and sounds for their hip-hop beats.</p>

I believe music inspires us to higher heights and brighter futures.  And music can document and change how we interact with each other as creators and collaborators.  
I am J. Plunky Branch, saxophonist, producer, band leader and songwriter.  My career spans over 40 years, during which time I have performed countless gigs, toured the world, lectured, mentored, written over 400 songs and produced and released 25 albums.
My mission is to create music that is a bridge between past and future, music that creates new possibilities; and then to take that music to the people via touring andexposure through various media. 
I am seeking your support in a campaign to raise funds to manufacture and market my new CD album, NEVER TOO LATE.  (Look at the benefit levels over on the right)
My History
In 1967, while a student at Columbia University in New York City I formed my first band called the Soul Syndicate, a rhythm and blues group that was described as “14 pieces of driving soul.”  After leaving college I migrated to San Francisco where I performed with a South African Musician, Ndikho Xaba, for three years.  In 1972, I formed Juju, a band dedicated to performing acoustic avant garde jazz blended withtraditional African and Afro-Cuban rhythms. 
Over the years my group evolved through name changes (from Oneness of Juju to Plunky & Oneness) and several incarnations,while exploring various genres and combinationsof Black music, including: R&B, jazz, funk, neo-soul, Afro-beat, go-go, reggae, and hip-hop.  In recent years several of our recordings from the 1970’s and 80’s have been re-issued by European and Japanese labels, re-mixed by rare groove deejays and, sampled by US hip-hop producers and rappers looking for unique rhythms and sounds for their hip-hop beats.
      
The New Album 
Never Too Late (to step up to the plate - click the button to make a pledge now)
NEVER TOO LATE is our latest multi-genre collection of songs.  It includes neo-soul, love songs, funky go-go, and jazzy instrumentals.  The 15 song album is adiverse but cohesive blend of music for listening and dancing.  
The album contains tracks that were produced by using samples from some of our earlier Afro-jazz funk records, and adding overdubs to create nu-jazz and nu-funk. 
Sampling our own early recordings and creating new cutting edge tracks is like musical time travel: revisiting the past to create music of the future.  Myson, Jamiah “Fire” Branch, has become my principal producer of tracks for mylatest albums and that makes the trans-generational, past-future aspect of themusic more manifest.  Obviously, it is never too late for anything if time travel is involved…
In producing this NEVER TOO LATE album Fire and I have spent countless hours recording, mixing, re-mixing the tracks and then tweaking the sounds to create a set of music that is listenable from beginning to end, an album of music to move people, and a compilation of songs that we truly believe people will embrace.

I'm Kristin Grice, AKA Kam and I am a singer/songwriter currently performing in and around the Orlando, Florida area. This campaign is to help finish production on my EP, All Or Nothing, which is an amazing project because of the message the music stands for. All or Nothing is the chosen theme for this EP because I want to give back to the audience and share my music, which is about never giving up on your dreams, fighting for what you believe in, and learning to be yourself. By donating to this project, supporters will help get the message out there, join in with creating inspirational music, and continued the motivation artists have to do what we love.</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>Our main goal is $1500. This price covers CD printing, studio time, session time with the other musicians to come into the studio and lay down tracks for my songs. Our main focus is to finish making the EP so the funds we are asking for is dedicated to helping finish the project that we've already started on. </div>
<div>Some of the perks we provide for donations ranges from exclusive email updates, digital downloads of the tracks, signed CDs, tickets to the EP release show, a web concert link, song lyrics, thank you letters, and even a signed guitar. If the goal is not made, the funds will still go towards finishing what we can of the CD and continuing to find a way to finish the EP because that is the promise that is made to the supporters and fans.</div>
<div>
<h3>Challenges &amp; Ways to Help</h3>
<div>Some of the challenges that will be presented with this campaign is promotion. I have a loyal following, but I've been booking shows at different locations and that has been tricky, so the need to promote is our biggest challenge. We also have other campaigns running in the same area as we do and our goal is to plug our campaign as hard and as long as we can. </div>
<div>The ways that you can assist us in this if you can't donate is promote, promote, promote. Pass on the information to other venues, copy the link and paste it on other sites, promote on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and anywhere else that will be beneficial. Getting the word out there is the greatest tool you have to help out! Don't forget to use the Indiegogo Share Tools on the website.</div>

<div>More than anything, this project is a stand still and it has been at a rest for almost a year now. I've done all I could to help out alone, but now I am asking for assistance. If you are unable to donate, please promote this project. The message behind this EP is important and it helps musicians like myself, all local musicians, continue doing what we love.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Ariana Proehl, and I created the online talk show Know This! because I was fed up with the lack of empowering images in our mainstream media. We are way more interesting and diverse than the tons of housewives shows we see, and all the debauchery on Jersey Shore. I wanted to create a platform to highlight all the next generation voices out there doing amazing work with real passion and purpose, and who make knowing yourself and knowing your world look cool and sexy.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I didn't create this show because I want to be on TV--I've actually been confronting a lot of self-esteem issues with being on camera and putting my voice out there to the public. I created it for the message to remind viewers that stories that educate and empower can be entertaining, too. So I thought, what better way to show and prove that than to take this show on the road! And because I'm ambitious (and sure, a little crazy :), I put together a 16-city U.S. tour to capture the essence of what amazing work is being done by youth, 20- and early 30-somethings around the country. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Here's where we're going:</p>
<p>
<span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: ""Times New Roman"";'>New York City (done!) – Philadelphia (done!) – Pittsburgh –
Detroit – Ann Arbor - Chicago – Milwaukee – San Francisco/Bay Area – Los Angeles – Austin - Houston
– New Orleans – Atlanta – Raleigh-Durham – Richmond – Washington, D.C. <br/></span></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I can say from the experience of our first two tour stops, that our tour is inspiring people to reflect on their true passions and find the confidence to go after their dreams. Every person we've reached out to about being on the show has been excited to be a part and let us in on the work their doing, as well as give personal insights as to how they made it to where they are today. We're also having great discussions about politics and social change, and showcasing younger voices that we don't typically see on CNN or other news shows. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Now more than ever, when our nation is lacking jobs, confidence and a lot of other things, we need a next generation that feels empowered, inspired and prepared to be their best selves and be actively engaged with their communities. Do we really want a next generation of leadership that has grown up on Snooki? And cat fights? Media is a reflection of our values and our aspirations--advertisers feed us what we're willing to buy and pay attention to. There's always room for some mindless fun and a good laugh at those reality shows, but it's also time for us to reflect not just the lowest denominator, but what the best of who we are and what we can be. Enough with the sex tapes and newsflashes of ""nip-slips."" I believe in you and believe that your Knowledge of Self is Sexy. The question is, do you?<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>All funds go toward our travel budget that includes rental car, airfare and food. We have some initial funding that has launched the tour, and we're looking for those who watch and believe in the mission of the show to help keep us on the road for all 16 cities in our tour plan!</p>

<h3>""Start Up"" Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Bryton Udy and I am from Calgary AB Canada. Over the past year i have stepped away from my hockey career and pursue my life long passion, music. Being so close to making something out of hockey, it was tough to step away but in my gut I knew that there was something else in my life that would drive me. And this is why this project means so much to me.</p>
<p>To get the ball rolling on my music career I have decided to record a 6 track EP of original songs that I have written over the past 3 years. This EP will be recorded by a first class producer as well as some of the best studio musicians from North America and im very excited! Along with the EP I plan to promote it with a music video to by a top notch videographer.</p>
<p>Your contributions will be the first step on the long journey of my music and will be the reason I go where I will go! I am determined to make something of my music and am looking forward to having you on my team to join me on this ride!</p>
<p> </p>

<div>
<h3>Where the Funds Go</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<p>$10,000 will make my vision a reality and every penny will go into the production of the music, the manufacturing of the hard copies, the uploading onto iTunes and the video.</p>
<p>Production/Mastering- $7100</p>
<p>Hard Copy's- $700</p>
<p>iTunes- $250</p>
<p>Music Video- $2000</p>
<p>if I'm not successful in achieving my funding goal the EP will still be produced and manufactured but it will take much longer and the quality of the sound of the tracks wont be as nearly as good.</p>
</div>
<div>

<h3>Campaign Summary</h3>
<p>Hi!  I'm Riley Roth, a 14-year-old award-winning Singer/Songwriter from Pennsylvania.  I just returned from my 2nd anti-bully tour within 8 months, where I was a co-headliner. Both tours have included former Radio Disney Artists. I've visited many schools to share the message to ""Stand and Defend and Be a Friend"".  I take this very seriously and was proud to complete this mission! My family and I covered all of my touring expenses. This expense is a lot. However, my anti-bullying efforts are important.  </p>
<p>I was recently asked to write the theme-song for <em>Girls Above Society</em>, a non-profit organization helping young girls become positive role models.  I was also featured in their online magazine as “Girl of the Month” in April and had a feature interview with <em>Pop Blitz</em> Magazine.  My anti-bullying song, “I Got Your Back”, was a monthly winner in the Texaco Country Showdown National Songwriting Contest in 2012.  This song encourages others to be a friend.  I am determined to continue spreading the word to STAND and DEFEND against bullies!  This summer I hope to record some songs in Nashville with a new producer and will be donating a portion of proceeds to Centre County Special Olympics.  Having a sister with special needs, I know that this group is often the most bullied.</p>
<p>I'm working with an amazing vocal coach and recently won the ""Progress Award"", awarded by the Throga Company in NY.  I'm RILED up and ready to record some new songs!  The only thing holding me back is the expense.  I've shared some of my new music with several industry pros who feel that I'm ready - both as a singer AND a songwriter.  I am also collarborating with pro writers in Nashville to find the best music.  With your help, I know I can do this!  This campaign is so important to me. I want to continue to take an active role in stomping out bullying and being a friend.  I do this through sharing messages, my music, and serving as a positive role-model to others.  I cannot keep up with touring expenses AND recording new music on my own.  I hope you will consider helping me continue down this path.  Your contribution, no matter how great or small, will be so appreciated!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am hoping to record at least 4 songs on an EP.  If I raise more, I will record more.  It is very expensive to go into the studio.  There are fees for licensing, musicians, production, tracking, mixing mastering, and of course travel to/from Nashville.  I cannot do this on my own!</p>
<p>I have established some great prizes for you, if you help me out!  Please check over the list on the side to see what you can get.  * <strong>In addition, if I receive funding beyond my goal, I will randomly give away a free pair of tickets to see Keith Urban in concert at the Bryce Jordan Center (University Park, PA) on November 22! </strong>These seats will be located within the first 17 rows in the floor, in front of the stage!  The recipient must meet me in person at a designated time on the day of the show, and enter the venue with me, to get your tickets.  These are paperless tickets so they must be picked up all together.  You are responsible for your own travel/lodging and other related expenses. This is not a raffle, as no tickets are being sold. These are not being awarded as a prize to any contest.  They are being offered as a ""thank you gift"" to one randomly selected donor.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is so valuable to me becasue it will enable me to share music and my message.  My lyrics are appropriate and most all songs have a message to young people.  Sometimes the message is about being a friend.  Sometimes it's a message to show what can happen when you go down the wrong path. Sometimes is a message about how you feel when you've been hurt by a friend or boyfriend/girlfriend.  I want to share sonhgs which teens can relate to.</p>
<p>Please note that if this project doesn't fund enough to record at least 4 songs, all money will be saved aside until additional funds are secured, at which time the project will be completed.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to make a financial contribution, please consider helping out by spreading the word about my campaign.  You can share on instagram, twitter, facebook, etc. and remember to use the Indiegogo share tools!  Helping my campaign go viral will increase visibility and that in itself is a huge help!</p>
<p><strong>Most importantly, I'd like to thank all of those who have helped to support me these last few years.  I couldn't do what I do, if you didn't do what you do.  You make my heart SMILE :)  Remember - Stand and Defend and BE a FRIEND!  Thank you!</strong></p>

<h2>Who we are</h2>
<p>Gran Turismo Veloce is an Italian progressive rock band. We have been playing across Europe and in Mexico for the past two years after the release of our acclaimed debut album ""<a href=""http://youtu.be/iTK9K9-Z_fc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Di Carne, di Anima</a>"". For our second album we prepared something special, and we need your help for it to become a reality.</p>
<h2>How the music business went wrong</h2>
<p>The hard truth is that if you are not distributed by a Major it is virtually impossible to grow a solid fan base. And today, without a wide fan base, the record labels don't take you into consideration. Rather a vicious circle, isn't it? And yes, this is the truth, because it is exactly what the chairmen of the two most important progressive labels in the world told us when we spoke with them during our 2012 tour.</p>
<h2>An offer they can't refuse</h2>
<p>We and you are partner in this adventure.</p>
<p>On our part, we are ready to record a new album at Sphere Studio in London with TesseracT producer Francesco Cameli on the mix; orchestral parts will be played live, by real musicians, and we'll have stunning session men from all over the world as well. </p>
<p>On your part, by showing how much you care about our second album, you will convince the record labels there is still a strong interest in new music.</p>
<h2>What we need...</h2>
<p>As we said, we are partners: the budget for our next album is around 25.000 €. We gathered around 10.000 € by ourselves and we hope the rest will come with your help. Don't worry: we will make the album no matter what, so you don't waste your money in any case.</p>
<p>Here is the detailed budget breakthrough:</p>

The hard truth is that if you are not distributed by a Major it is virtually impossible to grow a solid fan base. And today, without a wide fan base, the record labels don't take you into consideration. Rather a vicious circle, isn't it? And yes, this is the truth, because it is exactly what the chairmen of the two most important progressive labels in the world told us when we spoke with them during our 2012 tour.
An offer they can't refuse
We and you are partner in this adventure.
On our part, we are ready to record a new album at Sphere Studio in London with TesseracT producer Francesco Cameli on the mix; orchestral parts will be played live, by real musicians, and we'll have stunning session men from all over the world as well. 
On your part, by showing how much you care about our second album, you will convince the record labels there is still a strong interest in new music.
What we need...
As we said, we are partners: the budget for our next album is around 25.000 €. We gathered around 10.000 € by ourselves and we hope the rest will come with your help. Don't worry: we will make the album no matter what, so you don't waste your money in any case.

FAQ's

When will the album come out?
We have not announced a release date as of yet but will communicate that to you as soon as we get the deal with the label. Early 2014 is our best guess.
What if you don't reach the 20.000€ goal?
We'll find some way to gather what's missing to at least make a quality album. If no record label would greenlight our product, we will auto-produce the album. So, in any case, you won't loose your money and you'll get the perks you picked.
When will my stuff ship?

Just prior to release of the album (see above). Digital perks will be emailed to everyone at least 15 days prior to official release.
How do I pay for the shipping outside Italy?
After clicking ""Contribute Now"" and selecting your package, you can increase the contribution amount by € 6, 7, or 10 (please see perk description).


I forgot to pay for the international shipping!
No problem, just click ""Contribute Now"" again and make a contribution that is not for any specific package. Please make sure you make this contribution under the same email address as the original.",17.0,0,"1 Campaign

We've been around since 2011, and during that time we have released 2 EPs, 3 music videos, and toured most of the US East Coast and Midwest. We released our last EP, “Before the Sun Sets…”, through At Your Command Records in 2013, but we are now independent which allows us to make the most personal record to date for ourselves and YOU. We are already excited about the songs we have written, and we can't wait to share them with you!Why are we recording a full-length album instead of an EP? We might be old-fashioned, but we believe there is nothing better than getting hooked on a full album and experiencing the range of emotions that a CD can provide. Or getting caught up in that one song on the album that just speaks to you but isn't a single.




WHAT?When we're not on the road, we just scrape by working part-time jobs to accommodate our show schedule. Any of the money we make goes towards rent, bills, food, and the band; and we still come up short. After a year of playing shows all over the US promoting our latest album “Before the Sun Sets…”, funding everything has become more difficult. All this time away from home means a lot of time away from our main sources of income.  We've been so grateful for the support we've received. Without that support, none of this would be possible. However, the next step forward is just out of our reach at the moment. We just need a little help to get back into the studio and record a new full-length album. The plan is to record this album at Planet Red Studios in Richmond, VA with producer Andreas Magnusson (Haste The Day, Fit For A King, Oh, Sleeper). We're extremely excited to be working with Andreas, and we look forward to seeing how working with him will enhance our sound.WHEN?January 2015; we're set to start recording in mid-January, and we plan to release the album by May. Without help, the release of the album will be delayed while we continue to save money. We are currently in the pre-production process where we fine-tune the songs before hitting the studio. We will update you at every point in the process! Keep an eye on our Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, etc.HOW? Support from our friends, families, other bands, and even strangers at shows are what keeps this band going. Without all of you coming to shows, buying our music and merch, letting us crash on your floors, giving us care packages at shows, and sharing our music; we would not exist. Now we need your support more than ever to help us reach our next goal! Here are the costs we're looking at for this project:Costs:
Studio Time: $5,000
Music Video: $1,000
Promotions (Magazine ads, online ads, etc.): $2,000
Pressing: $2,000
Artwork (album and tees): $1,000
Total = $11,000Why are we only asking for $2,000 instead of $11,000? We don't expect an easy ride, we'll take care of the rest, we just need a little help. We also have some stretch goals, such as an acoustic EP, that we would love to be able to put out for you. With your help we will be able to release the album, music video, new merch, and get back on the road sooner than if we had to front the whole cost. Also by crowdfunding this album, we would have a chance to interact and involve you in the whole process in a way we couldn't otherwise. WHY?Crowdfunding is a fun and unique way for you to work with us to make the best album possible. Being in a band, it's already a gamble to keep your job, pay your bills, and keep your family happy, so we're alright with taking another chance. We've never tried this before, but we've heard the success stories of crowdfunding, and we hope this project will become one as well.GOALS:Initial goal: $2,000Stretch goal 1 ($3,000): Fan’s choice by vote of a cover song (acoustic) for us to record - everyone who contributed gets a digital download.Stretch goal 2 ($4,000): We will eat a Carolina Reaper pepper, record the experience, and will each thank every contributor while suffering. Stretch goal 3 ($5,000): We will record a 5-song acoustic EP to be released before the album - everyone who contributed gets a free digital download of the EP.ULTIMATE STRETCH GOAL ($1,000,000): We'll throw a giant free entry show hosted by Coolio and Lil Romeo.

<b><b></b></b><p><b>Gracias a vuestra contribución, podré lanzar este tercer disco y con él no solo beneficiarme yo, sino poder demostrarle a la industria que cuando uno quiere, se puede. Además como sabéis en el pasado, utilicé mi música como herramienta para ayudar a los más desfavorecidos y quiero seguir haciéndolo.

</div></div>","Breve reseña/ Brief Summary ¡Hola a todos! Soy Maria Bestar. Algunos me conocéis, por mi canción Pensado en Tí, y mi disco Sonámbula. Para los que no me conocen: soy una cantautora española, con muchas ganas de volver a los escenarios y compartir con vosotros todas mis vivencias a través de mi música.  Después de un ""brake"", porque me convertí en mama ¡vuelvo con más fuerza que nunca a los escenarios! Necesito vuestra ayuda para lograrlo y así evitar el firmar con una multinacional, para poder hacer un poco lo que yo quiera ¡y queramos todos! . ¡Estoy segura de que lo vamos a conseguir! !Gracias!.
Hi guys! I am Maria Bestar, some of you know me from the past, because of my song Pensando en Ti, and my second album ""Sonambula"". For others I am probably  totally new yo your ears. I am singer songwriter from Spain, that is eager to go back into the music business and share with all of you everything that I have achieved and learned this years .  After a  ""brake"" in my career,  because I became a mommy, I am back! 
 I need your help to be able to make it again, and to avoid signing with a big record label, we all know what happens with that!  Being independent , I can trully do what I love, the way I want and WE ALL want.  I am sure that we can make it! Thank you!!   Lo que necesito  y lo que obtienes/ What I need and what you get. Necesito la financiación para poder terminar de grabar el disco, y promocionarlo con todo lo que ello implica, video, fotos, prensa, gira, etc. 
I need the funds to be able to finish recording the album, and promoting it. That means, recording a musical video, photoshoot, tour, press kits....etc. 
Habrá muchas recompensas, desde discos autografiados,  canciones dedicadas, entradas a conciertos, camisetas firmadas,  poder estar en la grabación del video, incluso ser parte del video, componer conmigo para futuros albunes, conciertos privados, etc.  ¡Todo depende del entusiasmo que le pongamos!
There will be many rewards, from signed albums, to dedicated songs, to vip tickets to my concerts,  signed t-shirts, to be able to be present while recording the music video, to be part of the music video, to compose a song with me, even to have a private concert!!! it all depends on you!
  El impacto/ The impact

Gracias a vuestra contribución, podré lanzar este tercer disco y con él no solo beneficiarme yo, sino poder demostrarle a la industria que cuando uno quiere, se puede. Además como sabéis en el pasado, utilicé mi música como herramienta para ayudar a los más desfavorecidos y quiero seguir haciéndolo. Ahora que soy madre, y que encima los niños son mi pasión, quiero utilizar el vehículo de la música y el ser un personaje público para colaborar más en ayudar a los niños huerfanos o en condiciones precarias. 
Cuando lancé mi primer disco, que salió simultaneamente en Latinoamérica, México y España, contribuí con varias ONG de Colombia, Chile, Argentina y Mexico entre otras  y nada me haría más feliz que seguir haciendolo ahora.  Y algún día, cumplir mi sueño de financiar un orfanato.

<h3>Εορταστική Επανέκδοση ""Η Πόλις Εάλω""</h3>
<p>Κάποιοι δίσκοι δεν πρέπει να λείπουν απο καμία δισκοθήκη. Ένας τέτοιος δίσκος είναι και η ""Πόλις Εάλω"" των Terror X Crew, σημαντικός δίσκος, τόσο για την χιπ χοπ σκηνή όσο και για την εναλλακτική μουσική σκηνή της χώρας μας.<br/>Δύο δεκαετίες ο δίσκος βινυλίου ""Η Πόλις Εάλω"" στόλισε τις δισκοθήκες όχι μόνο ανθρώπων που ήταν εκεί όταν κυκλοφόρησε αλλά και αυτών που ξόδεψαν πολλαπλάσια της αξίας του προκειμένου να τον αποκτήσουν.</p>
<p>Το 1997 η απειρία παραγωγής δίσκων και η παντελής έλλειψη των audio mastering studio τότε στην Ελλάδα δεν κατέστησε δυνατό το mastering του δίσκου για το CD και πόσο μάλλον για το βινύλιο. Με αφορμή λοιπόν την εορταστική επανέκδοση θα εξασφαλίσουμε την διαδικασία του audio mastering. Αυτό λοιπόν από μόνο του, στο ηχητικό κομμάτι, τοποθετεί την επανέκδοση πολύ πιο ψηλά απο την πρώτη εκδοση, δίνοντας στο ηχογράφημα τον ήχο που του αξίζει.</p>
<p>Πέρα όμως απο την ηχητική αναβάθμηση του υλικού, δεν θα ήταν εορταστική επανέκδοση χωρίς κάτι παραπάνω. Γι αυτό η ""Πόλις Εάλω"" πέρα απο το κλασσικό μαύρο βινύλιο θα μπορεί να διατεθεί και σε συλλεκτικό κουτί (box set) το οποίο θα περιλαμβάνει ένα έγχρωμο βινύλιο ""Η Πόλις Εάλω"" και ένα βινύλιο με όλα τα ορχηστρικά (instrumentals) του δίσκου, φυσικά με την ηχητική επεξεργασία του mastering.</p>
<p>Είμαι ο DJ ALX, ο μουσικός παραγωγός της ""Πόλις Εάλω"" και σας προσκαλώ να συμμετάσχετε στην εορταστική αυτή επανέκδοση αναβιώνοντας μαζί μου μια εποχή, όχι πολυ μακρυνή αφού ακόμα και σήμερα ο απόηχος είναι δυνατός.</p>
<p>Για οποιαδήποτε απορία σχετικά με την επανέκδοση είστε ευπρόσδεκτοι στο facebook group <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/369305956752437/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/groups/369305956752437/</a></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Τί απαιτεί η επανέκδοση και τί παίρνετε εσείς</h3>
<p>Το χρηματικό ποσό που ευελπιστώ να συγκεντρώσω θα διατεθεί ως εξής:</p>
<ul>
<li>Άδεια χρήσης των ηχογραφημάτων και πληρωμή στην FM Records</li>
<li>Πληρωμή των πνευματικών δικαιωμάτων στην ΑΕΠΙ</li>
<li>Μεταφορά των DAT master tapes στο σημερινό format αρχείων wav</li>
<li>Mastering για βινύλιο στο Sweetspot από τον Γιάννη Χριστοδουλάτο</li>
<li>Μετατροπή των γραφιστικών για εκτύπωση offset</li>
<li>Χάραξη, κατασκευή μήτρας και στάμπας των ""Η Πόλις Εάλω"" και ""Η Πόλις Εάλω Instrumentals""</li>

<li>Να παρευρεθείς στο/στα restoration και mastering sessions και να παρακολουθήσεις πώς γίνεται το κάθε κομμάτι απο την αρχή μέχρι το τέλος, να αποκτήσεις πρόσβαση στη διαδικασία βιομηχανικής παραγωγής της επανέκδοσης και να λάβεις το συλλεκτικό κουτί με το περιεχόμενό του, δύο μαύρα βινύλια  και τα test pressings (Πακέτο Session)</li>

<h3>Η σημασία μιας τέτοιας κίνησης</h3>
<p>Κατα καιρούς λαμβάνω mail για το εάν υπάρχουν αντίτυπα του ""Η Πόλις Εάλω"" προς πώληση. Οι περισσότεροι με ρωτάνε εαν θα ξανακυκλοφορήσει κάποια επανέκδοση ενω αρκετοί είναι αυτοί που με παροτρύνουν να ασχοληθώ εγώ με την επανέκδοση αφού καμία εταιρία δεν ασχολείται πλέον. Μια τέτοια κίνηση λοιπόν είναι σημαντική όχι μόνο για μένα αλλά και για σας διότι: </p>
<ul>
<li>Μπορούμε όλοι (εγώ κι εσείς) να δούμε εκ των πραγμάτων πόσοι είμαστε, τί δύναμη έχουμε και κατά πόσο μπορούμε να ασχοληθούμε συλλογικά και να πραγματοποιήσουμε ένα τέτοιο project.</li>
<li>Θα μπορεί ο καθένας από σας που θέλει να έχει τον δίσκο ""Η Πόλις Εάλω"" στην συλλογή του να τον αποκτήσει χωρίς να πληρώσει πολλαπλάσια την αξία του</li>
<li>Θα μπορεί ο συλλέκτης, που ήδη έχει την πρώτη έκδοση, να αποκτήσει και αυτήν την ποιοτικά ανώτερη επανέκδοση </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Οι προκλήσεις και το ρίσκο</h3>
<p>Η πλειοψηφία δεν γνωρίζει τον συγκεκριμένο μηχανισμό και αρκετοί θα βιαστούν να το κατακρίνουν. Θελω λοιπόν να διευκρινήσω πως επέλεξα τη μέθοδο αυτή για την επανέκδοση του δίσκου κυρίως για να διαπιστώσω πόσοι πραγματικά ενδιαφέρονται δηλαδή εαν υπάρχει αρκετός κόσμος για να στηρίξει ένα τέτοιο εγχείρημα εμπράκτως πέρα απο προφορικά και γραπτά μηνύματα.<br/>Είμαστε αρκετοί για να πετύχουμε την επανέκδοση του δισκου; Είναι αυτός ο δίσκος ""αρκετός"" για εσάς ωστε μετα απο 20 χρόνια να αποκτήσει τον ήχο που του αξίζει και να επανατοποθετηθεί στις δισκοθήκες μας; Θα γίνει και πάλι προσβάσιμος σε όλους αυτούς που δεν τον πρόλαβαν τότε; Αυτή είναι η πρόκληση και το ρίσκο. Εάν μετά από 20 χρόνια δεν πραγματοποιηθεί η εορταστική επανέκδοση, θα μείνουν τα λιγοστά φθαρμένα βινύλια σε δισκοθήκες φίλων να μας θυμίζουν μια εποχή που έφυγε ανεπιστρεπτί.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Άλλοι τρόποι για να βοηθήσεις</h3>
<p>Επειδή δεν διαθέτουν όλοι λογαριασμό paypal αυτό δεν σημαίνει πως δεν μπορουν να βοηθήσουν:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ρωτήστε καποιον φίλο σας που έχει paypal εαν μπορεί να σας βοηθήσει να συμμετάσχετε με τον δικό τους λογαριασμό paypal</li>

<h3>Playing on tradition</h3>
<p>I love the popular music of the 1930s and 40s, the swing era. This is jazz for dancing, full of driving rhythms and riffs. The tunes are hummable and the solos are hot. ""Swings Left"" pays homage to the great small bands of Duke Ellington, Count Basie, &amp; Benny Goodman.</p>
<p>Over the past year I have been inspired to compose an album's worth of new tunes in this style. The instrumentation is traditional: clarinet, trumpet, piano, guitar, bass and drums. But my take on this music is very personal and quirky: I'm trying to push against the edges, while still maintaining the core. The musicians in the band all approach it with our contemporary voices. We're not trying to imitate the old recordings, but we are greatly inspired by the spirit of them.</p>
<p><strong>This album will feature some of my favorite collaborators:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ben Goldberg - clarinet</li>
<li>Andrew Stephens - trumpet </li>
<li>Craig Ventresco - guitar</li>
<li>Daniel Fabricant - bass</li>
<li>Elizabeth Goodfellow - drums</li>
<li>(and I'll be on piano)</li>
</ul>
</div><div><ul></ul></div><div>
<h3>An evolving voice</h3>
<p>At this point in my life I feel more inspired than ever. The creative process feels better as I get older and become more at ease with myself. This album will contain what I consider to be the best work of my career.</p>
<p>This is my third time raising funds for album production. My first, for the ""Circus Bella All Star Band"" resulted in a raucous circus album, full of extravagance and silliness. Then came ""Shadowbox"", a collection of moody originals. Both of these albums were made possible by the support of my fans, friends, and family.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Your support is essential</h3>
<p>I am only able to have a career in music because of people who support my work. All the money raised here will go towards making this album.</p>
<p>I'm asking for $10,000 total, which will cover the album's basic expenses. If I raise more than that, I'll put it into more marketing resources. Here's the basic breakdown of the budget:</p>
<ul>
<li>$3000 = musician payment</li>
<li>$1000 = studio &amp; engineer</li>
<li>$1500 = mixing &amp; mastering</li>
<li>$1000 = artwork &amp; design</li>
<li>$1000 = manufacturing CDs</li>
<li>$2000 = distribution &amp; marketing</li>
<li>$500 = website update</li>
</ul>
<h3>Thank you</h3>

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>Welcome to My Indiegogo Campaign!</p>
<p>My name is Eddie, Edward W. Hardy, and I am a composer and violinist living in New York City. I finally have an opportunity to own an incredible instrument that matches my personality perfectly; The Black Violin. I’ve been performing on this instrument for a year now, recorded and premiered my new music in concert halls, performed around the country, including Broadway and Off-Broadway shows, and even earned great reviews and press coverage. As I grew with this instrument, The Black Violin has become an extension of myself. <a href=""http://www.edwardwhardy.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.edwardwhardy.com</a></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Long Story (Like the one Mom tells you)</h3>
<p>Guy Rabut gave me the opportunity of a lifetime by loaning me The Black Violin and allowing me to grow and flourish with this unique instrument. We have reached an agreement for purchase and he is allowing me time to raise money which is great because it’s my first time ever doing this.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">How did this all happen? Well, this violin and I have a history</p>
<p>When I was ten years old living in Harlem, I attended The Juilliard School Music Advancement Program, Bloomingdale School of Music and Manhattan School of Music Pre-College consecutively. I was proud to have been awarded a violin from MSM, based on my merit, to use during my studies. I finally had a violin to use throughout my high school education. The violin would have to be returned upon completion of the program.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540846621/iqm7cycjl9yp0kudjxeh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>My new mission was to find a violin to own, so my parents researched violin-makers in NYC and came across Guy Rabut. I tried two of his violins and a viola, all quite lovely and all out of my price range. He handed me The Black Violin and said, “try this one”, it was love at first sight. He began to tell me the history of the The Black Violin and why he created it. The sound of it was so beautiful I knew this was the one. I asked Guy “How much is this Violin?” He smiled and responded “Too much”. So for years I never knew how much it cost or if I would ever see it or play it again. Over the years I dreamed about The Black Violin. </p>
<p>After my high school graduation, I received a promise of a scholarship to attend SUNY Purchase Conservatory of Music but only if I majored in viola, so I temporarily put down the violin in my classical studies and purchased a student viola from SHAR Music. During my first week I received the news; no scholarship.  I was heartbroken, too late to change direction. I was committed to my studies at Purchase College. I worked several jobs while in college in order to pay my tuition. I would later go on to earn a Master of Music Degree in Violin Performance.</p>
<p>Since then, I’ve been building relationships with luthiers learning about violins and borrowing beautiful and sometimes expensive violins for concert appearances.</p>
<p>Flash forward to 2017, I created my first one-man show called “Six Violins”. Some were inexpensive violins that I purchased and restored, others were on loan. I even acquired The Black Violin, But How?? Although several years had passed, I never stopped thinking about it. I could only hope that by some chance Mr. Rabut still had it. To my surprise, he did still have it and he did remember that young boy so full of wonder and enthusiasm. Who would have guessed he would have loaned it to me for a show, and then for a whole year? The time would come when I would have to commit to purchase or return it. I fell in love with The Black Violin and now it’s a part of me. He is allowing me time to raise money; somehow we both knew it was always meant to be.</p>

<p><strong>The goal of this campaign is to crowdfund the purchase of Guy Rabut’s Black Violin. Every little bit helps.</strong></p>
<p>Any and all of your contributions will help me purchase this unique, one of a kind modern looking instrument that will continue to grow with me throughout my career. The fundraiser will, more importantly, help connect me to all of you: family, friends, mentors, colleagues and even future friends that may choose to be a part of my musical journey.</p>
<h3>What Can You Get Out of This</h3>
<p>Different perks are offered for each contribution; from a digital single to live performance to an original composition dedicated to you! Check out the right side and figure out what level best suits you!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I hope other artists find inspiration from this campaign to tap into their resources and fund other creative projects and instruments purchases as I am. No matter what type of music, musicians are always looking for the perfect instrument that compliments them and advances their careers. Music as a universal language and through the sound of music one can describe an action or a response. Music can evoke an emotion; it can tell a story. This is something I believe in and the Black Violin is apart of my story.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please help spread the word and share this link, any of my posts anywhere because that will create an opportunity for others to see and listen to my work; hopefully encouraging involvement in this campaign. </p>

<p>Music today is almost pre-selected for us. Websites,
television and radio stations push the most known artists and songs because it
is a simple way to ensure frequent listeners or viewers. We believe that the
listener should have complete control over what music they listen to and
whether the music is considered good or bad.

Leaderboards separate genres of music hourly, allowing users to experience

artists from the unknown artists, which allows good artists who don’t have much

personalities such as Mumford and Sons, A$AP Rocky and The Weekend built their
career through internet marketing and a lot of talent. We at Nuhypes.com

<p>Being a social network based media
site means that the users decide what good music is and what is not. Here’s
your first chance to change what is considered the music of this generation and
not just complain about it.</p>
<p>The world needs a project like this
one, stop arguing on today’s networks over who deserves to be praised and help
do something about it!</p>
<p>Right now we are in the
developmental stage of our project. We need enthusiasts to continue our dream
that one-day music will be created and heard based on its overall production,
content and meaning, rather than just its popularity. </p>
<p><b>WHAT WE NEED!<br/></b></p>
<p>A media website of this magnitude
needs a lot of storage space and costs a lot of money to run smoothly, without
any obstruction to its users. Our site needs approximately the following in
order to complete successfully.</p></span><ul><li><p><b>20,000 in order to be completed</b></p></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>30,000 means a completely smooth,
completely professional website and staff to go along with it in a shorter
amount of time </b></li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>40,000 All the above plus we can
start working on the development for the phone application.</b>
</li></ul>
<span class=""notranlsate""><p>Any and all funds given will go
straight to the development of the website regardless of if our goals are
reached or not. Goals that aren’t completed will prolong our project, but we
are a determined team and will do all we can to complete this dream.</p>
<p><b>Help us how you can</b>, If you don’t have a credit card or
just don’t have any money to give its ok, help our campaign by getting the word
out. Share our link and help the Internet become a better place for better
music.</p></span><p><b><span class=""notranlsate""></span></b></p>

Our site is for those who want to inspire or be inspired,
who want to create, and for those who just want to browse, learn or listen.
Leaderboards separate genres of music hourly, allowing users to experience
brand new sounds. Nuhypes.com makes an effort to separate commonly known
artists from the unknown artists, which allows good artists who don’t have much
exposure, not to be overshadowed by those who do.
Nuhypes.com Leaderboard Page
Today many talented and successful artists and producers
come from a strong online background such as XX, Black Keys, and Lana Del Ray, these
are all great artists who became popular through the Internet. Even more famous
personalities such as Mumford and Sons, A$AP Rocky and The Weekend built their
career through internet marketing and a lot of talent. We at Nuhypes.com
believe that there are more talents and music that need the right outlet to be
heard at all. We just want to hear more good music, don’t you?



Being a social network based media
site means that the users decide what good music is and what is not. Here’s
your first chance to change what is considered the music of this generation and
not just complain about it.
The world needs a project like this
one, stop arguing on today’s networks over who deserves to be praised and help
do something about it!
Right now we are in the
developmental stage of our project. We need enthusiasts to continue our dream
that one-day music will be created and heard based on its overall production,
content and meaning, rather than just its popularity. 
WHAT WE NEED!
A media website of this magnitude
needs a lot of storage space and costs a lot of money to run smoothly, without
any obstruction to its users. Our site needs approximately the following in
order to complete successfully.20,000 in order to be completed
30,000 means a completely smooth,
completely professional website and staff to go along with it in a shorter
amount of time 

40,000 All the above plus we can
start working on the development for the phone application.

Any and all funds given will go
straight to the development of the website regardless of if our goals are
reached or not. Goals that aren’t completed will prolong our project, but we
are a determined team and will do all we can to complete this dream.
Help us how you can, If you don’t have a credit card or
just don’t have any money to give its ok, help our campaign by getting the word
out. Share our link and help the Internet become a better place for better
music.
More long term funding goals are:

<h3>Conjuring the Feathered Serpent</h3>
<p>For the past 20 years I have been preparing for this Dec 21st Winter Solstice, the final day of the Maya's prophetic calendar.  I've been chanting the days in various ways for many years.  Now I want to share it with everyone, to help us all center ourselves.  This Dec. 21st through the 23rd a pulse from the core of the Milky Way will lift the spirits of humanity.  But it will fade after that unless we're centered enough to hold the higher energy.  This CD I want to make will help folks perpare for that.  The chants are relaxing and deep.</p>
<p>I just need the funds to pay a sound engineer and a CD duplicator.  I can record ASAP.  I'll use the funds as they come in and take it as far as it can go to become a unique meditative listening experience. I'll do all the art myself and include all the lyrics and such.  I'll send them out as the funds come in.  </p>

<p><span>We </span>are Becca Ayers and Bradley Dean Whyte, musically kindred spirits.  Many moons ago, we made sweet, sweet music together in New York.  We'd hike, drink tea, write music, text band name ideas back and forth and play with llamas.  When Bradley moved to Thailand, it seemed our collaboration was finished,  but because of the new-fangled technology that the kids are calling ""the internets"", we were able to continue making music (#YOLO!  ... right, kids?!).  Bradley co-wrote and produced ""Lovesick"" with Becca from the jungles of northern Thailand just before releasing his first home-made studio record, ""The Emperor's New Tea"".</p>
<p>Today, Bradley resides in Houston, Texas, and when Becca came to visit from NYC this past winter, we rekindled our musical shenanigans and were all, ""this sh*t's for real, yo.  Time to make some... SpAzCaNdY.""  </p>
<p>We have that certain complex, volatile relationship that the fans just love:  Bradley annoys Becca, but Becca annoys Bradley even more.  #SWAG!</p>
<p>For most of our lives, we have been lucky enough to earn our living in the performing arts -- creating theatre, music, recordings, and teaching.   Becca continues to perform in NYC and has spent the last 9 years working on and off-Broadway<em>, performing improv with the Upright Citizen's Brigade, and continuing to write</em><em>.   Her Web-Series (co-created with the hilarious Brooke Jacob of ""Sitting On Babies"") titled, ""Snuggle Buddies"" will feature  Bradley and Becca's ""Lovesick"" as it's theme song, as well as a handful of other SPAZCANDY songs for the soundtrack!</em></p>

Since I graduated college in 2008 I have been running away from being a singer songwriter. I have performed out more and more but have always been too afraid to leave a steady job or a school structure and step out to create a path of my own. This has left very little time to write and record. When I do sit down to record something, I love to layer my voice and create choirs of myself. I like the challenge of using very basic and minimal recording equipment; I usually use GarageBand and a USB mic. I feel like I can get a lot accomplished with a little amount of time, but finding that time has been hard.  This January as I was preparing for a concert, I recorded a new song in an afternoon in my living room. I felt so happy and fulfilled, but also frustrated that  I couldn't take time like that more often. I decided I couldn't run any longer away from what I love for the sake of familiarity and stability. So now, for the first time ever, I'm taking a leap of faith. I'm cutting down my work hours drastically this summer and taking set time every week to write and record an album.

Durante los siguientes días conseguí unas semillas de una calabaza gigante (400kg) ganadora de un concurso de la zona. Sembré las pipas de calabaza a principios de Junio, y hasta ahora, día tras día, las plantas se han extendindo por toda la huerta con una fuerza y una vigorosidad asombrosas.
During the following days I got some seeds from a winning contest area giant pumpkin (400kg). I planted the pumpkin seeds in June, and until now, day after day, the plants have extended throughout the garden with amazing strength and vigor.

They dated Tom Waits in College and still call him when they're lonely.  They have a penchant for finding compelling and unusual sounds in strange and unlikely places.  Rusty Belle is Matt Lorenz, Kate Lorenz, and Zak Trojano.  They are a family of three that has taken their unique music to festivals, concert halls, and clubs across the country.  Right now, they are working on a new record called ""Common Courtesy.""  </strong>
</h3>
<p><strong>  ""Common Courtesy"" was recorded over 6 days at Sonelab in Eashampton, MA.  It was engineered by Justin Pizzoferrato (Dinosaur Jr.) and produced by David Goodrich (Chris Smither, Jeffrey Foucault, Peter Mulvey).   It is Rusty Belle's third studio record and they completed tracking for thirteen original songs.  The session was magic in many ways.   The entire second day of recording was done in the midst of a hurricane.  At night the skies cleared and the moon was full.  Everyone involved agrees that ""Common Courtesy"" is a record that sounds like a time and a place.  The performances are unusual and dynamic and only happened once.</strong></p>
<p><strong>  In order to complete the production and promotion of this record, Rusty Belle needs ten thousand dollars.  The money will go towards paying the recording engineer, mixing engineer, producer, and publicist.  The money will also go towards making physical copies of the record in the form of CD's and vinyl.  Rusty Belle is an extremely hardworking band.  Last year they played over 150 shows in addition to an almost constant schedule of writing and recording.  They need your help to bring this exciting music into the world!</strong></p>

<h3>We're The Few Who May from Phoenix, AZ.</h3>
<p>We're a relatively new metal band who have been playing for about 2 years now.  Given the natural progression of a band, we're looking to finally record our music to release to the public so you can hear what we've been working so hard on.</p>
<p>We now have the opportunity to record and produce our very first commercial-quality single titled ""The Placebo Effect"", but due to the nature of the music business, we don't quite have the financial base that we need to completely pull it off alone.  This is where you, our friends and fans come in.</p>
<p>Being able to have a fully produced song/EP is something we've always wanted to achieve since the beginning.  Again, as you know, the nature of the music business is difficult and having the foothold of a strong first impression for people to hear is a key to success.  You could help be the major part in building the foundation for our future.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What is the money going towards?</h3>
<div>Recording a quality song/EP is an investment for the bands future, so we absolutely will not do this half way.  To ensure that we will get the best sounding production, we need to make sure we don't cut any corners financially.  We've set our minimum goal to $1,500.  Being completely transparent with all of you, here's the breakdown of what will go into this project and what we can get for that amount:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>$800 would get us a full day in ""Studio A"".  That would be enough time to pick apart the song and truly build it to its full potential.  This would be the cost for tracking (recording)</li>
<li>$200 would get the song mixed and would give us a little breathing room for experimentation.</li>
<li>$500 would go to tying up all the loose ends of the project (mastering, CD duplication, etc) as well as help go to the cost of the perk packages.</li>
</ul>
<div>The best part about Indiegogo is this is not a donation.  This is an opportunity for you to be a part of the process of making our first song/EP and in return, you get rare merchandise that we wouldn't be able to press otherwise.  Shirts, Hoodies, Stickers, etc.  Be sure to check them out on the right hand side of the page!</div>
</div>
<div>Now, we know that $1,500 is a fairly large budget to shoot for being a fairly new band, but as we said before, we want to do this the right way, not the ""cheapest way"".  We've set this to be a flexible campaign so that we can still put the money raised towards making this happen.  If we pull in more than $1,500, we will look into doing an EP (2-3 songs).  That'd be the ultimate goal, but one song will still be a major boost to our career.</div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>On top of picking out one or more of the rare perk packages, you can also help by spreading the word.  Email the short link to friends, post the short link on your social media pages (facebook, twitter, myspace, etc), and put word-of-mouth into full swing by sharing it with your friends in social situations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We can't thank you enough for helping us make this long-term goal of producing ""The Placebo Effect"" finally become a reality.  We can't wait to show you what we've got!</p>

<h3>Stories through Songs</h3> <p>As a media student I am passionate about telling stories. As a musician, I do that through songwriting. I invite you to support my songwriting and story telling of what God has done in my life.</p> <ul>
<li>A little more about me. I am a military USAF Disabilty Civil Service former brat and Filipino born human in Florida. I enjoy playing music and singing, bible studies, church, spiritual conversations, the beach, reading, and television and movies. I just turned 30, graduated from FSU and Towson University, and currently reside in Fort Walton Beach, FL.</li>
<li>I was disabled in my right eye (the picture in the beginning of the video) by a bottle rocket on July 4th at the age of 5. That lit image from my optometrist is what remains of my eyeball with very limited sight with the exception of light. I have no clue what my right hand does when I play guitar basically. It just plays.</li> <li>This campaign is important to me because it is my life work, goal, and passion. Worship is the foundation of my musical background and playing, and passionate worship is the expression of me as an individual to give back my desolate heart to a forgiving and gracious all loving God.</li> <li>By being a contributor to this campaign you will bless a part of my journey in story writing and songwriting, contributing to the general funds of recording and producing music like I have already done in the past for your enjoyment and pleasure.</li> </ul>
<p>Remember, a lot of this is personal and testimonial to me.  Ask yourself: if I were to stop reading here, would I be able to find God in my music?</p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The Break Down:</p> <ul>
<li>I need about $600 to pay towards my record contract with Tate Music Group. This will signal to them that they are ready for me to produce my full recording album of 12 tracks. I've already done and paid for 2 EPs on my own which you may listen to both by Oct. 7th online and I continue to pay into my contract for this once in a lifetime deal. They are going  to take management of me and also produce me a website and take over my social media pages &amp; produce another hit record!</li> <li>So  get excited! Here are the perks:</li>
<li> 1) $1 Dollar donations are generally accepted just as general support to me and to continue doing God's music here on earth. Your generosity is greatly appreciated towards this endeavor.</li>
<li>2) $5-10$ Dollar Contributors receive one or both of my EP's ""The Will and The Way"" and ""The Will, The Word, and The Way"".</li>
<li>Any larger donations will just be because you're awesome and God loves you .</li> <li>If I don't reach my whole goal of $600, the funds will still go towards my recording contract. If I go OVER my goal, the extra funds will go towards a UMCOR mission relief fund through church to the Philippines and to charity.</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>You people are the difference factor in all of this:</p> <ul>
<li>Not only will you be able to say you know and contributed to my work as a musician, you will be reaching hearts for God and to the world..</li> <li>I've never done fundraising online, but with a local Hurricane Haiyan Relief Concert I raised over $300 playing music from ""The Will and The Way"" and on Reverbnation.com as an Indie Artist I've remained in the top 3 Tier of musicians on the charts in my genre in the area.

</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> People may think I'm crazy. They may think I suck. They may think I'm a false prophet or teacher by singing or saying what I say. All those things are not true and all I can say is I'm here working and living for the Kingdom of God to be known on Earth and the glory of Jesus Christ to be revealed. Please help me in fulfilling my calling and bless me by helping me complete my goals so you can hear more music.</p> <ul>
<li>To overcome these challenges we have to have an open door, heart, and the mind of Christ to discern what the will of God is, over the will of man, and to hear God being glorified through these musical sounds unto Heaven, not theology or debate over Biblical interpretations or religiosity.</li> <li>My plan for doing this is the same plan I have used to overcome negativity and that is to pray and play. Would you pray and sing alongside me?</li> </ul>

To overcome these challenges we have to have an open door, heart, and the mind of Christ to discern what the will of God is, over the will of man, and to hear God being glorified through these musical sounds unto Heaven, not theology or debate over Biblical interpretations or religiosity. My plan for doing this is the same plan I have used to overcome negativity and that is to pray and play. Would you pray and sing alongside me?

<h3>My First CD!</h3>
My name is Joshua Tooth, and I'm asking for your help! I am a musician and a songwriter, I've been playing gigs and writing original songs for several years and I'm finally ready to put together my first EP, six full radio-quality songs. I need your help to do that!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I've always dreamed of making a living playing music, of writing that one song that connects with people and makes them feel, just for a moment, with every fibre of themselves. Music is everything to me and my own songs even more so. Time has come to take the next step!</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<h3><strong>Exactely what my plan is...</strong></h3>
<p>I am trying to raise funds to record a proffesional standard EP recording of six of my original songs. This entails a couple of steps...</p>
<ul>
<li>Songwriting workshop stage; in order to make sure I'm not the only one who thinks my songs are worthwhile, I need to spend some time with a proffesional songwriter and worshop my songs. ($500)</li>
<li>Recording, editing and mastering; this is the big job, recording the songs in a proffesional studio, adding rhythm and other instruments. This is the important part and so I'm determined to use a studio who will do this project justice! ($6500)</li>
<li>Creating and distributing the CD's and songs! It's no good having these fantastic songs if no-one can hear them. I need to create 1000 CDs at least for you guys to enjoy and to get my songs out there and (hopefully...) on the radio and in people's ears! ($1500-$2000)</li>
<li>Launching the EP; This is where it all pays off!!! An EP launch, gigs across the state from Yarrawonga to Portland, urban and country! iYou and everyone else will get to see me sing my songs live! ($1000-$1500)</li>
</ul><p>There it is guys, exactely what your donations are going towards, and feel free to make any suggestions to me, I need all the help I can get!</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>What this means...</h3>
This is my lifelong dream, to be a singer/songwriter. Not only are you all helping to make some fantastic music and taking the chance to be a part of something special creatively, but you're all making my dream come true and proving to me that I can fulfill my dream!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Not only that, but you are demonstrating the force of people-power! There is still a way for artists to remain independant and retain creative control, and there's still a way for the general public to support artists at a grass-roots level, and decide for themselves which music is made and heard!</div>
<div>

<h3>Hey Everyone!</h3>
<p>My name is Chris, and I'm a songwriter. I was born in Colorado, but spent my diaper years onward in the frozen plains of South Dakota before moving to Portland, OR and eventually Austin, TX. Throughout all this time, I've been writing and performing songs. Now, it's time to record a studio album.</p>
<p>While I've recorded a lo-fi EP (Roots) before (<a href=""http://chrisstrand.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">you can download it here</a>), I'm ready to record a whole batch of new songs in a professional studio. It's one of the most personal projects I've undertaken, and the songs matter more to me than I can say. They focus on family, loss, apathy, love, mischief, and how people treat and mistreat each other and themselves. The goal behind them is to take you somewhere and make you see something differently--even if it's only a detail--and I am proud of them. </p>
<p>However, I can't fund this record alone, and your help means everything. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; How It'll Be Spent</h3>
<p>Everything you donate will go to fund this project. None of it will be blown in Vegas, Amsterdam, or Marfa. Here's the breakdown of how the money will be spent.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Tracking and Mixing: $2560</li>
<li>Mastering: $800</li>
<li>Professional Musicians (bass, drums, cello, fiddle, steel, electric, and harmonies): $1900</li>
<li>Manufacturing of CD's: $500</li>
</ul>(This may change, but it's a pretty close estimate.)<p></p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal, I will continue to save, max out a credit card or two (Kevin Smith Style), and mow lawns until I can pay for this album.</p>
<p>If I exceed the goal, the extra money will go toward producing more CD's and touring, which will happen soon!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why Should You Help?</h3>
<p>Few things have mattered to me more than music. As a kid, I played in everything from pop punk bands (ah, to be 14) to Midwest hardcore bands (when I was an angsty 18 year old). Before that, I even sang in a choir and tried to write songs on the family piano with just my 8 year old pointer fingers. Now, I'm ready to make a real record.</p>
<p>Here's what you can get if you donate:</p>
<p>- a big, fat smile on my furry mug and my eternal gratitude<br/>- A digital download of the solo version of Settle Down<br/>- A digital download of the entire album <br/>- A physical copy of the album with a thank you note from yours truly. <br/>- A signed copy of the album complete with a hand-drawn thank you note. Expect stick figures, sharpies, and smirks + all of the above<br/>-  A shout out in the liner notes of the record, on the interweb, and at the cd release show<br/>- A Skype/house show in which I play you the entire record<br/>- A songwriting session<br/>- We'll cowrite a song, and I'll travel to your doorstep</p>

<p>So where does all that money go?</p>
<p>I'm glad you asked.  Basically, without breaking everything down over half a page of budget bliss, we can lump the cost of making a record into these two categories: </p>
<p><b>Creation </b></p>
<p>Pre-production, studio recording time, artwork creation, album design, studio engineer, mixing &amp; mastering, musician costs - <b>$7,500</b> </p>
<p><b>Production</b></p>
<p>Making all of those worthless CD’s, vinyls, t-shirts, hoodies, stickers, postcards, etc… and then posting them all over the world - <b>$7,500</b></p>
<b>GRAND TOTAL : $15,000 </b><p></p>
<p>I'll go you halves.</p>
<p>Usually a band or their label would then go on to the third stage... promotion.  This is the bit where you spend mad stacks of cash on a video clip, tour, advertising, promotion and other crap.  My budget for this? - <b>$0</b></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">A long time ago now, when I did </span><a href=""http://jukebaritone.bandcamp.com/album/the-salted-man"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></a><a href=""http://jukebaritone.bandcamp.com/album/the-salted-man"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""line-height: 1.45em;"" target=""_blank"">The Salted Man</a><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">, some of you generous souls contributed to that project by pre-ordering your copy and you helped to get it over the line. </span><br/></p>
<p>You guys crowd funded that record before sites like Indiegogo even existed and myspace was still cooler than facebook. <br/><br/>That record wouldn't exist if it wasn't for you and I certainly wouldn't survive without you.</p>

<h3>Why Buy Something?</h3>
<p>It's pretty tough to make a living from music.  </p>
<p>I'm always a little taken aback when <strike>ex-wives</strike> people assume I'm doing really well financially. </p>
<p>Let's look at some facts.  Here's a little pie chart (mmmm pie) from the month of January 2014 showing the number of times my songs were <b><i>listened</i></b> to through digital <i><b>streaming platforms</b></i> (pandora, spotify, deezr, etc...) and the number of times my songs were <b><i>sold</i></b> through digital <b><i>sales platforms</i></b> (bandcamp, itunes, amazon, etc...)<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">                    </span></p>
<p>                      <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/434745/files/20140314183009-juke_streams_vs_sales_number_jan_14.jpg?1394847009"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Pretty impressive number of streams...  I think.  1,716 sure looks good next to the paltry number of sales for that month...</p>
<p>I'm certainly stoked that on average my music gets streamed about 2000 times every month of the year.  It's cool.  Those streaming services are a great way to hear music.</p>
<p>But let's flip that pie chart around and see what it works out to in dollar terms.</p>
<p></p>
<p>                      <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/434661/files/20140314171805-juke_streams_vs_sales_dollars_jan_14.jpg?1394842685"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Depressing.  That's right.  Those 1,716 digital streams works out in this case to a whopping $4.51 while the 44 digital sales equates to a huge $34.78.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">If those 1,716 streams were instead someone paying just $1 for 1 song or just even $1 to buy the whole album (as you can do on bandcamp), I might actually be able to feed my <strike>drug habit</strike> kids from time to time.</span></p>
<p>And that's why you should buy something.  </p>
<p>The same goes for any of your favourite artists, bands, film-makers or musicians.  </p>
<p>Just buy something from time to time.</p>
<p>We can't survive if you don't.</p>

<h3>Some Of My Other Work</h3>
<p>As mentioned, I've made two full length records in my time.  The first (self titled) one <a href=""http://jukebaritone.bandcamp.com/album/juke-baritone"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Juke Baritone</a> was around 2006/7 and the second one <a href=""http://jukebaritone.bandcamp.com/album/the-salted-man"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Salted Man</a> was around 2008/9.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Here's the video clip to </span><a href=""http://jukebaritone.bandcamp.com/track/rusty-bed"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""line-height: 1.45em;"" target=""_blank"">Rusty Bed</a><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> from The Salted Man.  It's worth noting here that the version of the song used in this video clip was never released... (it was really a demo) along with a few other songs.    </span><br/></p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FY3yq03Hi-vY&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DY3yq03Hi-vY&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FY3yq03Hi-vY%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p>The album version below is a completely different recording (which thankfully someone else uploaded to youtube) and I probably should have waited to make that video clip to this version but such is life sometimes.</p>

<p>I did the same thing here with a song called <a href=""http://jukebaritone.bandcamp.com/track/the-last-of-the-kings"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Last of the Kings</a>, also from The Salted Man.  There were two different versions... one of which (the demo) was used to promote The Spiegeltent Season at The Sydney Opera House which we were a part of and the other version went to the album.</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FSNcZw_oz0Yc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DSNcZw_oz0Yc&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FSNcZw_oz0Yc%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FMMenW1zUJmA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DMMenW1zUJmA&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FMMenW1zUJmA%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>

<p></p>
<p>And the same was true with my earlier self titled Juke Baritone record.  There were three different versions of the same song <a href=""http://jukebaritone.bandcamp.com/track/ya-said-ya-loved-me"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ya Said Ya Loved Me</a>... originally called Broken Man and at one point called The Swamp Dog Stomp... yeah yeah I've totally got commitment issues.</p>

<h3>FAQ's</h3>
<p><i>Q: Why is it going to take so damn long?</i><br/><br/>There's a lot of stages to making a record and I'm right at the beginning of the process. The songs are written, some parts have been recorded and the rest of the recording, mixing, mastering, artwork and design is happening from right now and over the next 6-8 weeks.  After then, it's going to take some time to create everything and arrange all the distribution (ie: making sure it's available for sale and in itunes, etc...). But you guys will be getting some sweet stuff along the way like the exclusive access, your postcards and then the single and some of the merchandise which should be ready to start dripping out around July 2014.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Q: I move around a lot.  What happens if I move and you send my stuff to my old address?</i><br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I'll be checking with everyone that I have their correct address </span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">before</i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> sending anything out.  Make sure you use a valid email address or phone number for contact.   We're friends now.</span><br/></p>
<p><i>Q: How much is it for postage?</i></p>
<p>Postage is included in the pricing already.  Because I live in Australia and about half of you live overseas, I've picked an average flat shipping rate worldwide... this means that some people are paying a little more for shipping than it will actually cost and some people are paying a little less.  I've done it this way because I got really annoyed looking at all these other campaigns that say <i>""add $10 for shipping if you live outside the U.S.""</i></p>
<p><i>Q: Will you really come anywhere in the world to have dinner and play a private show for me?</i></p>
<p>That's the plan.  It's best if you drop me a message before you buy any of those major perks but if you're on my existing touring routes; Australia, UK, Europe, North &amp; South America, then I can come to you as long as you're flexible on the date.  I'd really like to come to Japan.  I'll have to work your show into an existing touring schedule or create one around it.  Some parts of the world are a little tricky to get a visa for and some parts are probably completely out of the question.  Get in touch first to be safe but I'd love to come anywhere in the world that you want me to.</p>

</div></div>","PRE-ORDER THE NEW JUKE BARITONE ALBUM AND RELATED MERCH :By the time this campaign is over, the recording and mixing sessions will be complete!  If we raise the cash then I'll be dropping the first ""single"" and getting all this stuff pressed and delivered into your sweaty little paws.About The New AlbumYes I'm making another record.  Excited?  I am. The work has already begun. And by work... I mean that the drinking and smoking writing and recording has begun.This will be my third Juke Baritone record and if you're not familiar with my work, you can check out my other stuff way down below or by clicking here. When I started to think about making this album, I had about about fourteen (14) tracks that I thought would become... Joking with Bears. But as I've been remembering writing more and more material, it looks like I'll have to split it out over 2 or 3 records because there are far too many songs to fit on one album.Even after I take out all the crap ones.So now I'm leaning towards a trilogy of albums that are intrinsically linked together by the same theme.This will be the first record in that trilogy.And you're going to make it happen.What We Need & What You GetEssentially I need $7,500 from you guys at a minimum to make the new album happen.There’s going to be CD's and downloads, t-shirts and hoodies and you should definitely buy one of those. There’s going to be some stickers, postcards, handwritten lyrics and a whole lot of other stuff that I hope you can get your hands on too.Everyone who commits to this project will be kept updated with EXCLUSIVE content including behind the scenes recordings, access to demos and works in progress.  I'm even thinking of letting you choose the first single!  This is stuff you won't get anywhere else except by backing this new work.  I'll also be offering EXECUTIVE PRODUCER credit, your name printed in the thank you section of the CD, dinner and backstage access with me and the band, song dedications on youtube and EXCLUSIVE private shows with the band for the serious investors.The money raised here will cover the entire manufacturing process of these perks and includes no funds for recording, mixing, mastering, promotion (video clips, advertising) or touring... I'll be covering most of that myself.But there's a lot more I can do... like a full length vinyl, kick ass video clip, lyric & picture book and an earlier world tour... if we raise more than $7,500. So don't be shy now. Show me the money.Previous merchandise (this is what some of the old stuff looks like... NOT what you're buying here!!!!)The Budget
So where does all that money go?
I'm glad you asked.  Basically, without breaking everything down over half a page of budget bliss, we can lump the cost of making a record into these two categories: 
Creation 
Pre-production, studio recording time, artwork creation, album design, studio engineer, mixing & mastering, musician costs - $7,500 
Production
Making all of those worthless CD’s, vinyls, t-shirts, hoodies, stickers, postcards, etc… and then posting them all over the world - $7,500
GRAND TOTAL : $15,000 
I'll go you halves.
Usually a band or their label would then go on to the third stage... promotion.  This is the bit where you spend mad stacks of cash on a video clip, tour, advertising, promotion and other crap.  My budget for this? - $0
The Impact

A long time ago now, when I did The Salted Man, some of you generous souls contributed to that project by pre-ordering your copy and you helped to get it over the line. 
You guys crowd funded that record before sites like Indiegogo even existed and myspace was still cooler than facebook. That record wouldn't exist if it wasn't for you and I certainly wouldn't survive without you.
I've got no record deal. No manager. No publicist. No booking agent. No commercial radio play. Nobody is throwing money at me to make music or video clips. 
I am 100% independent.
And with your continued support, I can stay that way forever.



Why Buy Something?
It's pretty tough to make a living from music.  
I'm always a little taken aback when ex-wives people assume I'm doing really well financially. 
Let's look at some facts.  Here's a little pie chart (mmmm pie) from the month of January 2014 showing the number of times my songs were listened to through digital streaming platforms (pandora, spotify, deezr, etc...) and the number of times my songs were sold through digital sales platforms (bandcamp, itunes, amazon, etc...)                    
                      



Pretty impressive number of streams...  I think.  1,716 sure looks good next to the paltry number of sales for that month...
I'm certainly stoked that on average my music gets streamed about 2000 times every month of the year.  It's cool.  Those streaming services are a great way to hear music.
But let's flip that pie chart around and see what it works out to in dollar terms.

                      

Depressing.  That's right.  Those 1,716 digital streams works out in this case to a whopping $4.51 while the 44 digital sales equates to a huge $34.78.
If those 1,716 streams were instead someone paying just $1 for 1 song or just even $1 to buy the whole album (as you can do on bandcamp), I might actually be able to feed my drug habit kids from time to time.
And that's why you should buy something.  
The same goes for any of your favourite artists, bands, film-makers or musicians.  
Just buy something from time to time.
We can't survive if you don't.

Some Of My Other Work
As mentioned, I've made two full length records in my time.  The first (self titled) one Juke Baritone was around 2006/7 and the second one The Salted Man was around 2008/9.
Here's the video clip to Rusty Bed from The Salted Man.  It's worth noting here that the version of the song used in this video clip was never released... (it was really a demo) along with a few other songs.    

The album version below is a completely different recording (which thankfully someone else uploaded to youtube) and I probably should have waited to make that video clip to this version but such is life sometimes.

I did the same thing here with a song called The Last of the Kings, also from The Salted Man.  There were two different versions... one of which (the demo) was used to promote The Spiegeltent Season at The Sydney Opera House which we were a part of and the other version went to the album.



And the same was true with my earlier self titled Juke Baritone record.  There were three different versions of the same song Ya Said Ya Loved Me... originally called Broken Man and at one point called The Swamp Dog Stomp... yeah yeah I've totally got commitment issues.
And then of course there's this gem which I didn't make (bless all you fans for doing these) but it features my song To The Bar and is absolutely worth the watch...

<h2>Dear Amigos,</h2>
<p>Thank you so much for your continued support of our musical endeavors! We are pleased to announce that we are going to begin recording our first full-length album at the end of August.</p>
<h3>ABOUT THE PROJECT:</h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;""></span></p>
<p>The Amigos Band celebrates the great adventure of American music. From New York to Nashville, from the Blue Ridge Mountains to San Francisco, we search for the heart of American song and learn from the musicians and mentors we meet along the way. Over the past three years, we've toured the country, introduced new Amigos into our ensemble, and established ourselves as a strong voice in the New York music scene. Now we feel that we are ready to commit to our biggest artistic challenge yet.</p>
<p>Our debut full-length album, a journey through the American musical landscape, will present fresh takes on traditional songs alongside new Amigos compositions. We are thrilled to bring in our Amigo, the legendary musician and composer <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Amram"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">David Amram</a> to serve as artistic producer and to help guide us in this process with his experience, wisdom, and musical magic. A friend and collaborator of artists like Thelonious Monk, Jack Kerouac, Leonard Bernstein, and Pete Seeger, David Amram stands at the important juncture between the jazz, beat, folk and classical worlds. His lifetime of collaboration and exuberant energy is a great inspiration to the Amigos. We will be appearing with Mr. Amram at the Philadelphia Folk Festival and New York’s Lincoln Center in the fall of 2013. </p>
<p>Along with Mr. Amram, we will work with the fantastic producer/engineer <a href=""http://www.devingreenwood.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Devin Greenwood</a> (The Sweetback Sisters, Norah Jones, Langhorne Slim, Amos Lee, Steve Reich, Sufjan Stevens) to produce the record at his studio, The Honey Jar, in Brooklyn. Mr. Greenwood’s phenomenal resumé, his knack for sculpting beautiful soundscapes, and his patient, encouraging style have made him the unanimous choice for producer/engineer.</p>
<p>Our hope is that this album will be a testament to the endurance of American music—bringing generations together to create something beautiful and lasting.</p>
<h3>WHAT WE NEED:</h3></span>
<p><span></span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Crafting a creative, well-rounded, and great sounding album takes thoughtful preparation, talented and compatible musicians, plenty of time for experimentation, state-of-the-art technology, skillful engineers and producers, and a good deal of money. </p>
<p>To properly prepare, record, mix, and produce this album we will need to raise $7500. Any additional funding received in excess of this amount will be incorporated into the promotion of the album.</p>

<h3>ABOUT THE AMIGOS:</h3>
<p>“...The Amigos have their own loose-limbed charm...serving up a sprightly mixture of folk, country, mariachi, and more.” - The New Yorker</p>
<p>""The Amigos are one of the hottest new bands to come to my attention. Singing, playing, dancing around the mic in bright matching shirts ... they have a visual thing going on that most bands lack... more fun and exciting than anything I could have imagined. They are new and refreshing, and I'm very proud of presenting them."" - Gene Shay, WXPN</p>
<p>""Their harmonies are so in tune they defy technology... great swinging bebop solos, and every idiom done with love and understanding."" - David Amram</p>
<p>""If The Amigos don't win you over with their toe-tapping, genre-busting music mix or their infectious enthusiasm, they'll get you with their matching western shirts."" - John Platt, WFUV</p>
<p>The Amigos Band (based in New York City) is a collective dedicated to performing and creating American music through the traditions of collaboration and improvisation. Built on the belief that all strains of American music are branches of the same tree, the Amigos return to their roots and bring together every form from bluegrass to jazz, with intricate vocal harmony and a style all their own. In 2014, The Amigos will represent the U.S. State Department as cultural ambassadors on a five week international tour. The Amigos Band has appeared in recent performances with Pete Seeger, David Amram, Ranger Doug, The Time Jumpers with Vince Gill, Jim Lauderdale, and Nellie McKay. They recently gave sold-out performances at New York City’s Lincoln Center and their semi-regular ""The Amigos Band Presents"" series at New York's Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola has appeared in previews and critics picks in the New Yorker magazine and the Village Voice. In 2012-13 the Amigos performed over 40 concerts in New York City schools, hospitals, and community centers as part of Jazz at Lincoln Center’s outreach programming. The Amigos will appear on Nashville’s Music City Roots in summer of 2013, and at the Philadelphia Folk Festival in August.</p>
<h3>ABOUT DAVID AMRAM:</h3>
<p>David Amram has composed more than 100 orchestral and chamber music works, written many scores for Broadway theater and film, including the classic scores for the films Splendor in The Grass and The Manchurian Candidate; two operas, including the groundbreaking Holocaust opera The Final Ingredient; and the score for the landmark 1959 documentary Pull My Daisy, narrated by novelist Jack Kerouac. He is also the author of three books, Vibrations, an autobiography, Offbeat: Collaborating With Kerouac, a memoir, and Upbeat: Nine Lives of a Musical Cat published in the fall of 2007 by Paradigm Publishers. <br/></p>
<p><br/>A pioneer player of jazz French horn, he is also a virtuoso on piano, numerous flutes and whistles, percussion, and dozens of folkloric instruments from 25 countries, as well as an inventive, funny improvisational lyricist. He has collaborated with Leonard Bernstein, (who chose him as The New York Philharmonic's first composer-in-residence in 1966), Dizzy Gillespie, Langston Hughes, Dustin Hoffman, Willie Nelson, Thelonious Monk, Odetta, Elia Kazan, Arthur Miller, Charles Mingus, Lionel Hampton, Johnny Depp and Tito Puente.</p>

<p> </p></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","*** Thanks to your generous support, we have reached our initial campaign goal. If you haven't pre-ordered the CD or contributed to the campaign, there's still time to participate.

We hope to raise an additional $3,500 to help finance print, radio, and online promotion for the album. 
This includes working with a publicist to secure album reviews, creating captivating online video content, and providing radio stations across the country with copies of the album for airplay. These services are expensive but absolutely essential to the success of an album. Please help us share this music with as many people as possible! 
Dear Amigos,
Thank you so much for your continued support of our musical endeavors! We are pleased to announce that we are going to begin recording our first full-length album at the end of August.
ABOUT THE PROJECT:

The Amigos Band celebrates the great adventure of American music. From New York to Nashville, from the Blue Ridge Mountains to San Francisco, we search for the heart of American song and learn from the musicians and mentors we meet along the way. Over the past three years, we've toured the country, introduced new Amigos into our ensemble, and established ourselves as a strong voice in the New York music scene. Now we feel that we are ready to commit to our biggest artistic challenge yet.
Our debut full-length album, a journey through the American musical landscape, will present fresh takes on traditional songs alongside new Amigos compositions. We are thrilled to bring in our Amigo, the legendary musician and composer David Amram to serve as artistic producer and to help guide us in this process with his experience, wisdom, and musical magic. A friend and collaborator of artists like Thelonious Monk, Jack Kerouac, Leonard Bernstein, and Pete Seeger, David Amram stands at the important juncture between the jazz, beat, folk and classical worlds. His lifetime of collaboration and exuberant energy is a great inspiration to the Amigos. We will be appearing with Mr. Amram at the Philadelphia Folk Festival and New York’s Lincoln Center in the fall of 2013. 
Along with Mr. Amram, we will work with the fantastic producer/engineer Devin Greenwood (The Sweetback Sisters, Norah Jones, Langhorne Slim, Amos Lee, Steve Reich, Sufjan Stevens) to produce the record at his studio, The Honey Jar, in Brooklyn. Mr. Greenwood’s phenomenal resumé, his knack for sculpting beautiful soundscapes, and his patient, encouraging style have made him the unanimous choice for producer/engineer.
Our hope is that this album will be a testament to the endurance of American music—bringing generations together to create something beautiful and lasting.
WHAT WE NEED:


Crafting a creative, well-rounded, and great sounding album takes thoughtful preparation, talented and compatible musicians, plenty of time for experimentation, state-of-the-art technology, skillful engineers and producers, and a good deal of money. 
To properly prepare, record, mix, and produce this album we will need to raise $7500. Any additional funding received in excess of this amount will be incorporated into the promotion of the album.
We have set a deadline of September 9th to ensure that we get the funds necessary to complete the project.
IN RETURN FOR YOUR SUPPORT:
In addition to our sincere gratitude for your above-and-beyond support, we have created several levels of rewards for your contributions, ranging from a pre-ordered digital copy of the CD to a personal Amigos House Concert. See the right-hand column for a full list of rewards. 
Thank you again for your interest in our artistic vision and for your dedication to keeping the arts alive and well.

We are the Gore-Stained Axe Tribe, otherwise known as A Band of Orcs.  We have been in your realm since December 2006 planning and implementing the Domination. We are an Independent Tribe (i.e., an unsigned band).  Due to our newly forged alliance with Hard Impact Music (our manager) and Rock the Nation USA (our booking agent) owned in part by Maurizio Iocano (singer for Kataklysm & Ex Deo) we have been given the opportunity of a lifetime.

(Get this autographed poster as a perk.)
Beginning Orctober 2nd in Columbus Oh, we will embark upon the Madness at the Core of Time Tour 2013 with Gwar, White Chapel, and Iron Reagan.  Add to that the dates we'll be playing on the way to joining up with the tour and returning from Washington DC, we'll be playing about 50 dates (click for dates and ticket links) covering over 22,000 miles, spending nearly two months on the road, with nary a day off.  This costs quite a few gold ducets.  



The reconnaissance is in, the most cost-effective way for us to do this raid is by renting a yurt on wheels, or what you humans call an RV.  By the time you factor in the gold required for hotel rooms, food, and vehicle rental, even of a basic kind, the RV saves money and helps guaranteed that us oRcs will be well-rested enough to stage a great auditory battle night after night with the antarctic alien overlords that claim to run this ruined planet.

It is unheard of for an unsigned band to get such an opportunity, so we mean to take full advantage of it.  We do get paid a pittance, but will only sometimes cover the fuel from one village to the next.  Mostly this tour is an opportunity and an investment in our future Domination plans. We must PREVAIL!  Having no label and no sponsors means we must do it on our own.  Well, that's not strictly speaking true.  We can do it with the help of YOU, Our Tribe Away from Home.  We ask you to participate in Orcstory and trade your gold for weapons and magic, eerrrrrr...merch and special custom items forged by orcs for you.
Take a look at some of the wares we have to offer in exchange for your gold.

No shrine to your future enslavers would be complete without graven images, minni-usses, to paint up and worship.  Hail Gzoroth!!!!

<h3>Hey, it's Tank:</h3>
<p>Ever since last year, we've been saving up money here and there to record a new song for you every once in a while, and we always end up just giving the music away for free. We love being able to give you new music and have it cost you nothing.</p>
<p>This is what we plan on doing with this E.P. as well, but it's not cheap - and we never profit from this.</p>
<p>The E.P. will consist of 5 newly recorded tracks. The track listing is as follows</p>
<p>1. Intro</p>
<p>2. New Worlds Of Fear</p>
<p>3. Dead In Dreamland (Punk version)</p>
<p>4. The Shadowlands</p>
<p>5. Pet Sematary (Ramones cover)</p>
<p>I know a lot of our fans have been begging for us to finally record our version of Pet Sematary, so this is your chance to help make that happen. This will be released on CD as well as digitally.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $1,500 (300 a track) to record this new E.P. We're aiming for $1,600 so that after Indiegogo takes their cut of this, we'll still have enough to record.</p>
<p>No matter what, if you contribute - you receive something. Check out some of the perks.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal, the funds will go towards recording regardless, but we'll have to cut a song or two based on how much we fall short...but let's hope we won't even have to worry about that!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Just recently we raised $150 in less than 8 hours to record our song ""25 Holidays"". Our friends over at Rose Glen Entertainment helped us out and made a video for it as well. Without the help of generous donations like that, we couldn't do any of this. We're on our own label now. No one is paying our way. We NEED your help on this.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute, that's fine! We understand. If you can't contribute but still want to help us out, spread this link around everywhere you can. Post it on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, message boards, etc. This needs to be seen by as many people as possible, or else it might not come to fruitiion....</p>

I've created an album with all new tunes that not many people have heard,  put them together and released them under the name MOONLIGHT !What I Need & What You GetApart from the singles already released, money has never really crossed my mind. I make music because I love it. Recently I have decided to take this more seriously, and I need some equipment to do so. I want to try and build £2000 to make this possible. If I can push it to £2500 then I'd be able to buy the upgrades but that's after we've hit 2000!  With this I will invest it into some brand new pioneer equipment. I really want to start playing out to you guys around Europe and beyond, but without this equipment, I'm not moving forward.Obviously its not me making money off you for no reason, the money goes towards the future of my act. All that have contributed will get  a download of Moonlight and more in mp3 format. The Album consists of some of my favourite music that  means a lot to me. I've put my heart into all of the tracks to create an exciting journey for you.THE IMPACTThe outcome of what has been achieved so far is beyond belief.  I am honoured that people take time to listen to my music, and that they enjoy it! Its hard to believe that I have fans from far and near. The impact of achieving this goal would be life changing for me. If I can get this money, together with you and me, the possibility's are endless.  Just to confirm, that the album will be available to download after the 30 days are up, so hold tight!Other Ways You Can HelpIf there is no way of helping out, don't worry, its not a problem at all! Even you taking the time to read this campaign is a positive for me. If you enjoy one of my songs, that's enough joy for me. If you could maybe spread the word of this campaign, that would be absolutely magic!I will be posting updates of the campaign to let you know how the project is going!Keep your eye on my soundcloud for teasers of the albumSoundcloud - https://soundcloud.com/woody1993Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/woodydnbofficial?fref=ts",0.0,1,"1 Campaign

<li>Hey everyone! My name is Colton Beha and i'm from Portland, Oregon. I currently am attending Portland State University and am studying Communications. I'm a huge fan of sports, and love to play music. </li>
<li>This Campaign is something I didn't imagine I would be doing. I recently took a step back and looked at what i'm doing with my life. I prayed to God and asked for guidance for what I really want to do with my life. I love sports and would like to work in the field of a broadcaster. My full passion though, is music. It's something I'v been doing my whole life. Playing for God on Sundays is what I do, but I wanted to do more. Getting accepted to Hillsong, well that seemed to be the more I was looking for.  </li>
<li>Whatever you guys donate, EVERYTHING will go towards my tuition and cost of attending Hillsong. Anything will help! </li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>What do I need? Also, what's in it for you guys?</h3><ul>
<li>The whole cost to attend Hillsong for a year is $25,000. That is accounted for Tuition, Cost of living, flight cost, everything! I am putting all of my income towards Hillsong, but it won't be nearly enough! I need all of the help I can get!</li>
<li>To reward everyone for what they donate, I have perks to give! For example, if you donate $50, I will give 1 free 1-hour drum lesson! Or if you donate $80. 2 free, 1 hour drum lessons! Other perks available as well! (Mind as well use my talents to help other people! :-)</li>
<li>The first part of getting everything paid for is getting my Ceo (Certification of Enrollment). Once I pay and receive that, I must then apply for a Visa and then eventually buy my plane tickets! So again, anything you donate will help greatly! </li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>How will you impact me?</h3><ul>
<li>Music has always been a passion of mine. I have been playing drums for 9 years now. I'v been playing for churches for about 5 years now. I'v always wanted to do more for a church and for playing, but didn't know what to do, or how to get involved. Now, I think i'v found it. </li>
<li>My goal for all of this, is to not only develop my skills in being a drummer, but to expand my relationship with Jesus and to learn more than I ever have before. I want to teach other people what I learn from Hillsong, and to share my stories and experiences. I want to go out and do more. A lot more!</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>How else can I help?</h3><ul>
<li>If you aren't able to contribute at this time, help me get the word out to people about my campaign! Share this to other people and let them know what I'm doing! </li>
<li>Most of all, please continue to pray for me as this Journey continues and I look forward to the future! Thank you so much for your support, prayers, and everything!</li>

Whatever you guys donate, EVERYTHING will go towards my tuition and cost of attending Hillsong. Anything will help! 
What do I need? Also, what's in it for you guys?
The whole cost to attend Hillsong for a year is $25,000. That is accounted for Tuition, Cost of living, flight cost, everything! I am putting all of my income towards Hillsong, but it won't be nearly enough! I need all of the help I can get!
To reward everyone for what they donate, I have perks to give! For example, if you donate $50, I will give 1 free 1-hour drum lesson! Or if you donate $80. 2 free, 1 hour drum lessons! Other perks available as well! (Mind as well use my talents to help other people! :-)
The first part of getting everything paid for is getting my Ceo (Certification of Enrollment). Once I pay and receive that, I must then apply for a Visa and then eventually buy my plane tickets! So again, anything you donate will help greatly! 
How will you impact me?
Music has always been a passion of mine. I have been playing drums for 9 years now. I'v been playing for churches for about 5 years now. I'v always wanted to do more for a church and for playing, but didn't know what to do, or how to get involved. Now, I think i'v found it. 
My goal for all of this, is to not only develop my skills in being a drummer, but to expand my relationship with Jesus and to learn more than I ever have before. I want to teach other people what I learn from Hillsong, and to share my stories and experiences. I want to go out and do more. A lot more!
How else can I help?
If you aren't able to contribute at this time, help me get the word out to people about my campaign! Share this to other people and let them know what I'm doing! 
Most of all, please continue to pray for me as this Journey continues and I look forward to the future! Thank you so much for your support, prayers, and everything!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

As a child I had this dream of seeing and hearing thousands upon thousands of people screaming my name at me from under a spotlight, I don't know how this dream happened, I never thought about it, it just.....happened. Well, little did I know that dream was the genesis of my life and career. My mother always made sure her children played an instrument growing up, I started on the violin and quickly moved to percussion where I stayed throughout Elementary School, Middle School, and High School, where I performed on the drum line. I have always played drums for bands in High School, and still do 3 yrs. out of graduation. Upon graduating High School I switched my middle and first names and started using the name 'David Ryan' for musical purposes. With that change came another. After 13 yrs. behind the kit, I felt now is a time to change it up, I have always wanted to record, press, and release a record I can call my own. I've played drums on tracks of course, but those were other people's songs, and their songs only. Not this time. I want to record an EP that I can share with <i>everyone!</i> I want these songs to be your songs as well, that's why I am calling upon you all for help.

<p>3 years ago we decided to follow our dreams &amp; pursue music in every way we could. We began a project called Savannah and have pushed with everything we have to build this band, growing everyday and falling more and more in love with our creation. With support from our fans, family, and friends we have made it to today, and have realized this is the time that we put it all on the line and put everything we have left into our next album. <br/></p>
<p>We are heading into the studio to record our next release. A brand new album with all new songs and we couldn't be more excited. Up until now, everything we have released has been produced, engineered, mixed, and mastered all by us, in our home studio. This time around we are excited to announce we will be heading into a major studio to work with an incredible producer and engineer. But there's only one problem, and that's money. Because we are an independent band, our funds are limited and recording isn't exactly cheap.</p>
<p>This is where you come in, friends and fans. We hate to ask you to just give away your hard earned money, but believe we have come up with the best way to engage you and make you a part of this band, our music, and our next album. </p>
<p>Enter Indiegogo. Indiegogo allows us to give back to you as you support us and help us reach our goal, and fulfill our dream to head into a major studio to create our next album. We want to make you feel like a part of something, a part of the band, a community. We want you to be able to say that it was because of you that we were able to pull through and make this dream come true for Savannah. This album is for each of you.</p>
<p>So how will we give back to your funding? With incentives, or physical rewards for your donation. You will find a break down of things you will receive at different amounts of donations for this project on the right hand side of this page. </p>

You will get the first 2 EP's immediately, and you will get the new album a week before its release!<p></p>
<p><b>EVEN MORE | giving back to our community:</b></p>
<p>No matter what, we decided that Indiegogo was our only option for recording this next album. We wanted to find a way to both offer incentives for fans of Savannah, and to dedicate our time and appreciation to give back to our community. </p>
<p>A few years ago we had the incredible privilege to spend time playing music and teaching children at Orlando's own Arnold Palmer Hospital for children. The satisfaction we had from putting smiles on the faces of these children was beyond anything we had ever experienced. It is this reason that we are dedicating our time to these children again.</p>

<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>For every $1,000.00 we raise, we are donating 5 hours of our time to teaching, playing, and hanging out with these children with the hope of inspiring, motiving, and potentially changing their lives. If we reach our goal of $12,000.00 this means we are dedicated to 60 hours of time at the hospital. For every $1,000.00 after our goal, we will double the hours dedicate an additional 10 hours of our time.  </p>

<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>From the Flint area of Michigan, Shadow Image is a rock duo formed by singer and multi-instrumentalist Harley Mace with partner in crime on keyboards, Mandy Monster. We combine influences ranging from goth, deathrock, post-punk, heavy metal, and classical piano, to create a sound which defies definition and fuses memorable, underground music of the past with dark tones of today.</p>
<p><span>We are currently working on our debut album titled ""Kiss the Ashes"", produced independantly by ourselves to be released this May through Danse Macabre Records. </span></p>
<p><span>Our album is already well on it's way to being finished but we need your support. We're offering this campaign as a way to pre-order directly from the band and allow your contributions to make the most difference.</span></p>
<p><span>Visit our Youtube channel and to hear some of our previously released music and some previews for this upcoming album. We will be updating it periodicly with more videos as we make progress. </span></p>

<h3>Why do we need pre-orders? </h3>
<p>We are producing this album ourselves. This means we have unlimited creative freedom and get to release the best music we can. However, it also means that we bare the complete cost of production financially upon ourselves. Most of this has already been invested from our own pockets with the expectation and hope of recouping from future sales. So this is where our fans come into play.</p>
<p>By pre-ordering you help us pay for all things involved in our music production as well as the album media as a whole. This includes but isn't limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instruments</li>
<li>Audio Cables, stands etc</li>
<li>Microphones</li>
<li>Digital Audio Workstation (computer and audio interface or sound board) and Software</li>
<li>Camera, lights, tripod and stands</li>
<li>Speakers, monitors and headphones</li>
<li>Utilities (eletricity etc)</li>
<li>Living expenses while working on the music (food, water, <strong>COFFEE</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>But, this fund raiser also allows us a way to throw in a few bonuses to our fans who pre-order depending on the level of support you choose. We want to do as much as we can to offer you all something cool. Of course, that depends on the level of support we get.<span><br/></span></p>

Who are we?
From the Flint area of Michigan, Shadow Image is a rock duo formed by singer and multi-instrumentalist Harley Mace with partner in crime on keyboards, Mandy Monster. We combine influences ranging from goth, deathrock, post-punk, heavy metal, and classical piano, to create a sound which defies definition and fuses memorable, underground music of the past with dark tones of today.
We are currently working on our debut album titled ""Kiss the Ashes"", produced independantly by ourselves to be released this May through Danse Macabre Records. 
Our album is already well on it's way to being finished but we need your support. We're offering this campaign as a way to pre-order directly from the band and allow your contributions to make the most difference.
Visit our Youtube channel and to hear some of our previously released music and some previews for this upcoming album. We will be updating it periodicly with more videos as we make progress. 
http://www.youtube.com/user/ExcrucioAeternus
Preview track ""The Call of Midnight"" on soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/harleyworkinprogress/the...

 


Why do we need pre-orders? 
We are producing this album ourselves. This means we have unlimited creative freedom and get to release the best music we can. However, it also means that we bare the complete cost of production financially upon ourselves. Most of this has already been invested from our own pockets with the expectation and hope of recouping from future sales. So this is where our fans come into play.
By pre-ordering you help us pay for all things involved in our music production as well as the album media as a whole. This includes but isn't limited to:

Instruments
Audio Cables, stands etc
Microphones
Digital Audio Workstation (computer and audio interface or sound board) and Software
Camera, lights, tripod and stands
Speakers, monitors and headphones
Utilities (eletricity etc)
Living expenses while working on the music (food, water, COFFEE)

 
But, this fund raiser also allows us a way to throw in a few bonuses to our fans who pre-order depending on the level of support you choose. We want to do as much as we can to offer you all something cool. Of course, that depends on the level of support we get.
T-Shirts?
Shirt design by Robert Inhuman from Dreams In Hell. Please specify the size you need: Men's or Women's Small, Medium, Large, and XL. Sizing chart: http://oi44.tinypic.com/2v16ovb.jpg

<p>""Something about kirtan""</p>
<p>Hi, this is Gen of Blue Earth Healing in Santa Fe, New Mexico and producer of the Sacred Music Festival.</p>
<p>For a lot of years in my life I struggled with anxiety (who doesn't?) but I couldn't find relief until I found kirtan -- call and response chanting, singing with a devotional bend to it. Something about kirtan took me beyond 12 step support groups and yoga exercises and prayer. Something about kirtan brought me back to  my Self, to a grounding place with Source, to a place where I didn't have to jump back into Flight or Fight Syndrome and pack my backpack and run away everytime things got weird.</p>
<p>In 2007 I moved back to Minneapolis from afar and was very loney and Spirit had me put on the first Midtown Yoga Festival. It was so much work and I went into a lot of debt but it was worth every effort and dollar spent. We did it again in 2010 in the Twin Cities Yoga Festival and I came out only a few dollars short on my budget and I didn't pay myself, either.</p>
<p>NOW, here, in Santa Fe, I see that good people are craving more spiritually uplifting cultural events than ever before; we need a real Rx for the hard times around us; we need to gather as community and find a common note, a shared voice -- and kirtan is what draws us together and this is what we give back to the world.</p>
<p>Please help us make that a reality. Donate today to bring world-renowned  experts in Sacred Chant, Poetry &amp; Music to our community.</p>
<p>If we can get the amount we are asking, we will be able to pay the talent and the workers, we will be able to keep ticket prices affordable and will be able to share potential proceeds with One Common Unity and their humanitarian efforts.</p>
<p>We're offering some fab perks, too, to really make you feel involved in a wonderful event, to be part of this community.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need a budget of $10,000<span style=""font-size: 10px;""> to remunerate our talent, pay for the venue, enroll the community as vendors, sponsors &amp; advertisers and get the quality support to pull this off.  With a $3,500 Indiegogo Campaign funded, we can keep the price of the tickets realistic and:</span></p>
<p>* Rent the Railyard Performance Center for Friday's Yoga with Live Music with Girish and HawaH. (I've put the deposit down already.)</p>
<p>* Rent the Center for Spiritual Living for Saturday's Kirtan concert and Sunday's Yoga with Indu and the Chant Workshop. (Deposit done!)</p>
<p>* Help the local economy and give good business to our community as we hire helpers, provide transportation &amp; food for the Crew, provide advertising for vendors and sponsors.</p>
<p>Our presenters are particularly special and unique. Perks include a once-in-a-lifetime autographed photo of the Talent; or a copy of HawaH's extraordinary text, The Poetry of Yoga -- or, best ever, become a VIP and come to all of the events and join us for supper!</p>
<p>The event will go on whether or not we reach our funding goal. But if we reach it, and if we exceed it, there will be seed money for the 2014 event and room for more give-aways and charitable contributions in the form of tickets and promo specials.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help:</p>
<p>Can you help get the word out and make some noise about our Sacred Music, Yoga-Poetry weekend in Santa Fe?</p>
<p>You can use the Indiegogo share tools and let all your FB and other social media friends know!</p>

<p>The <strong>John Kuegeler Memorial Summer Music Camp</strong> is a one week band camp experience during the month of June for Cleveland Ohio youth musicians that is being presented as a memorial tribute to John C. Kuegeler.</p>
<p>John C. Kuegeler, a Cleveland Ohio performing musician, composer and educator was passionate about working with all age groups, especially young musicians. John was awarded a 2012 Workforce Fellowship for music from the <em>Cuyahoga Partnership for Arts and Culture</em>. Unfortunately for our community, John passed away suddenly in June of 2012.</p>
<p>Our program will bring together youth from across the city for this very special one week experience to prepare and perform a variety of jazz music compositions for the general public under the guidance of a professional music conductor. Our goal is to have students from different schools and backgrounds across the city come together for challenging and enjoyable musical fellowship and performance. The students will rehearse the material Monday through Friday, and perform the selections on Saturday for the general public.They will also have the opportunity to rehearse and perform with professional local vocalists and poets as guest artists of the camp, an experience we believe is invaluable in their growth as ensemble performers. The students will also participate at the Waterloo Arts Festival.</p>
<p>There will be a live DVD recording of the performance that will be available after post production and editing.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Student auditions will be a two part process.</strong></p>
<p>1. A essay submission including the following topics</p>
<p>         ""How music has inspired me""</p>
<p>         ""How I plan to continue integrating music into my life as   an adult to one day impact the world community""</p>

<p>Though it's a year away, there is much to be done to insure that this is the best Banjo Blast Ever!

<p>The Four String Banjo is a truly American instrument and has played an important role in music circles for generations.  The Ukulele, is another fun instrument that had it's hey-day in the 1920s, again after World War II and is once again experiencing renewed interest as is evidenced by the many local ukulele bands springing up all across the nation.    Our goal with the Arizona Banjo &amp; Ukulele Blast is to insure that future generations know and enjoy the Four String Banjo as well as the Ukulele and other 4 string instruments.  By exposing young people to the happy music of the Four String Banjo, they develop a love  for the old songs we all enjoy so much!   No matter where you hear ""Ain't She Sweet"" or ""Sweet Georgia Brown"", the atmosphere is uplifting and people are happy.  You just can't listen to Four String Banjo music without smiling and tapping your toes.</p>

<p>We are BETZEFER, a 4 piece rock/metal band from Israel. We have been internationally active since 2005 and released a couple of albums on international labels (Roadrunner, AFM).</p>
<p>For the past year we have been hard at work on our new full-length titled ""Suicide Hotline"". It contains 13 killer new soulful, bluesy and grooving metal tracks which we are sure every metal or hard rock fan is going to LOVE!</p>
<p>We actually already finished recording all the tracks and are going into mixing sessions in September together with the wonderful Tue Madsen who we already worked with on our 2005 release ""Down Low"".</p>
<p><strong>That's where we need your help! Your money will go directly towards funding the mixing sessions, so that you could listen to the album as we envisioned it.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>But we don't want to stop there - after mixing, we plan on releasing the album's entire sources so that other people can remix, tweak and build upon our work.</p>
<p><strong>We sincerily believe these times of change in the industry are a good time for our society to reinspect its' take on ownership over ideas, and believe all ideas should be FREE (as in Free Speech, not necessarily as in Free Beer). We'd like to promote this idea further by contributing our work in its' entiety to the community which helped finance it.</strong></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p>We started this fundraiser in order to finish funding the mixing sessions - but we will also need the help of those of you with the technological means at a later stage with hosting and seeding this huge amount of data (all raw tracks are 24/96!) so it could be made available to all creative people out there, free of charge.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Any money raised through this indiegogo campaign over the initial $5500 US will be used to <span>pay the graphic and video artists who will contribute their art to the record - and only then towards h</span>elping us partially recoup our deep investment in the recording and mixing sessions.</p>

My name is Steven Wright and I'm the owner of S4R Studios in New York City, a ""For-Profit"" business that offers services for Recording, Rehearsals, music lessons, and photography services.
 
I constructed the Project:Dig initiative because as the business started to build, many came, but most were not able to come up with the finances to pursue the goals they wanted to. So I decided that once a week I would give an hour of music lessons for free or a free rehearsal session. The word spread and more came out. We started to ""dig"" out those hidden talents in the community. In order to make room for this I started Project:Dig.

Understand that in backing this initiative, more kids will learn instruments. More vocalists will learn to enhance their craft. More talents will be uncovered. Your help will defy the concept of a dream.
What We Need & What You Get
The funding needed for the first phase of this project is $10,000.

The Impact
How many people do you know that have said "" I used to sing"" or ""I used to play the piano for 10 years"", and put their gift away, never to pursue that part of their life again.

<p>It is a sensation of deep peace that pervades the body and mind.  It is a sense of tranquility and relaxation so deep that the mind goes and stays quiet and the Being surrenders to a sense of liquid ease.  Healing is well received from this state of stillness.</p>
<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>My name is Tory Trujillo and Music is my first love.  I am a massage therapist and professional vocalist. Healing through touch and song is my calling. In doing this work, I am also healed.  I've been singing professionally, mostly as a side player and harmony vocalist, since 2005.  Along the way many have asked if I had an album for purchase. I agonized for some time about not having traditional singer/song writer material. Then I started working with quartz crystal singing bowls in my massage practice for healing sessions and group meditations. Eventually, I started using the bowls in individual and ensemble performance ceremony events. I knew that THIS music would be my frist cd; sacred sound music for personal healing, meditation and for use in holistic healing environments.</p>
<h2>What is this Project?</h2>
<p>Through the support of community, I recorded the raw tracks for my first album ""Still Point"" in the spring and summer of 2012 <strong>(Click the ""Gallery"" tab above to see and hear 3 samples of rough mix tracks). </strong></p>

<li>mixing and mastering of the album</li>
<li>traveling to North Carolina to join Karen Kane in the mixing and mastering process</li>
<li>cd cover layout fees</li>
<li>printing and distribution of the cd</li>
<li>promotion of the cd</li>
<li>delivery of your ""thank you"" gifts</li>
</ul><p>I have chosen Indiegogo's flexible funding option.  This means that I receive all pledges as donations.  If we do not reach the goal, Indiegogo keeps 9% of those donations.  If we DO reach the goal, Indiegogo keeps only 4%.   Any donations above and beyond this goal will go towards promotion and distribution of the album.</p>
<p><strong>I look forward to completing this album! My hope is that all who listen will experience Still Point.  </strong></p>

<h3>In a nutshell...</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are the Trey Stapleton Band and we have been playing music in Austin, TX for the last 6+ years. We have fed off of the music of artists from Texas and beyond, past and present, and we hope you might become a fan of the music that we are making!</li>
<li>This campaign is very important to us. We are workiing with folks that are tied into the music industry here in a best-effort to get a single to radio and release an EP of 6 tracks to spread our music.</li>
<li>Helping with our project allows us to work with the professionals that have the experience and understanding to take our music to the next level.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>We aren't just wasting your money...</h3>
<ul>
<li>The money that you donate to us is going to only the finest professionals. Your money is helping us to pay for studio time, pre-production, mixing, mastering of mixes, production, duplication of CD's, demo recordings, studio musicians for various instruments (steel guitar, fiddle, bass, etc), radio promotion, and all of the unknown costs that arise when working on a major project.</li>
<li>In gratitude, we are honored to offer (for various donations): copies of the EP, signed CD's, signed photographs, merchandise, and even private shows!</li>
<li>Should we fail to reach our ultimate goal, we will still be able to wisely use the money that we do raise to release one single to radio (all recording costs involved and radio promotion) and then follow up that single with the full EP as soon as possible.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Your donation makes a difference!</h3>
<ul>
<li>Music is a gift to all. Any kind of music... anything that touches the soul! We take our music seriously, and hopefully the reward of knowing that you conributed to more music being available for willing ears to hear is pleasing to you, the contributor. Also, we hope that you feel good about being a part of helping an independent artist make its mark on the world!</li>
<li>We have released a full album in the past. In 2009, we released ""Have a Drink on Me"", an 11 track album that received some radio play in Texas. We have played hundreds of shows and, as with anything, experience makes you better. We have gained experience in all aspects of our music... songwriting, knowledge of promoting correctly, the recording process, and choosing the right people to work with. We hope that you will believe in us now!</li>
<li>This is truly a dream of ours, and a dream that we work hard for. We believe in our talent, and we believe that there are people out there who have the means to help a group like ours realize those dreams!</li>

<h3>Who is Petticoat Lane?</h3>
<p>Well, right now it's really just one guy, Michael Aaron Keith. That's me! I've been playing guitar, singing and writing music since I was pretty young and I've recently (finally) released a 3 song EP titled ""<em>The Table Turned</em>"".</p>
<p>But now I need to move on to bigger and better things. My current goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Record a full length album.</li>
<li>Turn Petticoat Lane into a band as opposed to a solo project.</li>
<li>Play shows, tour and promote the album.</li>
</ul>
<p>So this is where <strong>YOU</strong> come in.  Right now I am one man and the costs of paying studio musicians, recording, mixing, mastering, distributing and promoting are... well they're pretty high.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>By making a donation based on the packages to the right you will not only help with the costs of recording and distribution/promotion, you will also get perks:</p>

</div></div>","Who is Petticoat Lane?
Well, right now it's really just one guy, Michael Aaron Keith. That's me! I've been playing guitar, singing and writing music since I was pretty young and I've recently (finally) released a 3 song EP titled ""The Table Turned"".
But now I need to move on to bigger and better things. My current goals are:

Record a full length album.
Turn Petticoat Lane into a band as opposed to a solo project.
Play shows, tour and promote the album.

So this is where YOU come in.  Right now I am one man and the costs of paying studio musicians, recording, mixing, mastering, distributing and promoting are... well they're pretty high.


What We Need & What You Get
By making a donation based on the packages to the right you will not only help with the costs of recording and distribution/promotion, you will also get perks:

Downloads
CD's
Merch
+ More



Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't make a donation, it's all good! However, perhaps you could do one (or all) of the following:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------NOTES REGARDING PERKS

From the day I joined the AFM when I lived in Savannah, Local 447-704, the union has accepted me with open arms and love and so much solidarity. I have never found an organization as accepting, kind, and loving as the labor movement.

My goal is to tour performing in all fifty states. Union brothers and sisters like the president of my union Ray Hair and so many others have inspired me to attend the National Labor College starting Fall 2013 so I can become a leader in the labor movement like those I look up to so much. Traditional highland music is a great way to give back because I get to help make events even more fun and sometimes even help honor my lost union brothers and sisters at memorial services like I was honored to do when I performed for my local AFL-CIO here in NH for our Workers' Memorial Day.

<h3>What's it about?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The Musical
Offering is a community music school located in Evanston, Illinois. Founded in
2000, The Musical Offering acts as a hub for a diverse community through music
study, outreach and performance. It serves as a place of learning and a place
of creativity that sparks a love and understanding of music in every student
and performer. </p>
<p>In 2012 the
Musical Offering met a major milestone by doubling available studio space and
creating a beautiful performance venue with seating for 65 people, the Madison
Room. Through fundraising support, we are nearly halfway to our goal of raising
$30,000 to cover construction costs. Each dollar raised in this campaign allows
us to retire our debt and redirect our fundraising efforts back into the
people--the creators and collaborators--that make this school community music
school such a special place. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Our History</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The Musical Offering was founded in
2000 by Rick Ferguson and Kirsten Hedegaard. With two other like-minded
professional musicians, they began with a small space and 25 students. Each
shared a common philosophy on the role of the arts – specifically that music is
a positive force in society, in education and in the family. Their goal was to
create a place where people could learn to play music, learn to understand
music, and come together to create music.</p>
<p>Today, the school has more than 150
students ranging from toddlers to adults with thriving studios in piano, voice,
strings and growing program in winds as well as an expanding chamber and
composition program. The Musical Offering has always integrated composition
study as an integral part of the curriculum, which prompted a group of students
to combine their efforts and propose an original operetta. Now,
student-composed, written, produced, performed, and acted musical dramas are a
fall tradition. </p>
<p>The Musical Offering is inclusive;
anybody with an interest in music is welcomed and nurtured. Students come
primarily from Evanston, many near our location in south Evanston. We’re able
to offer need-based scholarships thanks to the support of generous donors. The
Musical Offering also conducts annual outreach programs in the Evanston public
schools. </p>
<p>Programmatically, the Musical
Offering vision is evolving and growing. This growth is manifested in the commissioning
of new works which are brought to local schools, and in being a venue for the
new student works featured in our fall productions. The Musical Offering is
becoming a destination for concerts and a burgeoning hub for New Music, in the
form of the nascent composers’ forum as well as the formation of a student New
Music ensemble. </p>
<p>All of this growth brings
excitement and challenges. We invite you to join us as we grow, to share the
gift of music, and to help us spread the word about what we do.</p>
<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p></p>
<p>In 2011, The Musical Offering assumed a $30,000 loan to
expand our facilities and create The Madison Room.  The Madison Room
is a performance hall that can accommodate 65 people.  It is the home of the Music on Madison concert series (themusicaloffering.org/mo/performances),
in addition to a place for group classes, our Sunday Series masterclasses and
workshops, and community gatherings such as meetings for art organizations.</p>
<p>Since April, 2013 we have been able to pay down almost half
the loan!  We urgently need to pay down
the rest of the loan in order to be able to focus all of our resources on our
students, our concert series, and outreach programs.  We are looking to raise at least $7500 to go
toward this loan payback.  This would
relieve us of a lot of pressure and put us in a position to comfortably work
toward a complete payback of the loan.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In thanks for contributing to our campaign and supporting
our students and the programs from which they benefit, we offer many incentives
that are keeping within the spirit of The Madison Room and our schools artistic
aims.  The incentives range from
heartfelt thanks to tickets to our Music on Madison concert series to an in-home concert
by Musical Offering faculty to a brand new composition written in your
honor.  Please see the list of incentives
to the right to see exactly what you would receive. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Although we
believe our incentives are pretty persuasive, especially, a concert in your
home or the commission of new musical work in your honor, every dollar we raise
in this campaign allows us to retire our debt and redirect our fundraising
efforts back into support for music study, outreach and performance. We know
that ultimately, it’s the people that make this school community music school
such a special place.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p>If you can't
contribute money, you can still help by sharing this with your friends, family,
followers, subscribers and connections! Post it, tweet it, email the link, and
leverage your circle’s social power. Any or all will help us! And check back regularly, to monitor our progress.</p>

I got bullied a lot as a kid, and I would turn to my writing to make me feel better - for years I never told anybody that I was writing songs, but eventually, I did. I have a passion for music, and since a young age I wanted to be a performer - I would put all of my stuffed animals on my bed, pretend like I was on a stage, and sing into one of those dollar store echo-microphones. I owned countless dollar store echo-microphones.</p><p><br/></p><p>My fascination with writing songs eventually lead to me taking up playing the guitar, at which I am self-taught, as well as the bass guitar and sometimes the piano. I started recording the songs that I wrote using a cheap computer microphone and my computer at home at the age of 15. </p><p><br/></p><p>Since then, I have come a long way. I have grown much more comfortable with the strong gay man that I have become. I have grown much more comfortable with the artist that I have become. And I've recorded an EP in a real recording studio, and released it for free for the people who have been supporting me all along.</p><p><br/></p><p>Here's the thing.</p><p><br/></p><p>Loving music is one thing - but eating, sleeping, breathing music is quite another. Without music in my life, I honestly don't know where I would be today. But when you create music - it gets expensive.

I got bullied a lot as a kid, and I would turn to my writing to make me feel better - for years I never told anybody that I was writing songs, but eventually, I did. I have a passion for music, and since a young age I wanted to be a performer - I would put all of my stuffed animals on my bed, pretend like I was on a stage, and sing into one of those dollar store echo-microphones. I owned countless dollar store echo-microphones.My fascination with writing songs eventually lead to me taking up playing the guitar, at which I am self-taught, as well as the bass guitar and sometimes the piano. I started recording the songs that I wrote using a cheap computer microphone and my computer at home at the age of 15. Since then, I have come a long way. I have grown much more comfortable with the strong gay man that I have become. I have grown much more comfortable with the artist that I have become. And I've recorded an EP in a real recording studio, and released it for free for the people who have been supporting me all along.Here's the thing.Loving music is one thing - but eating, sleeping, breathing music is quite another. Without music in my life, I honestly don't know where I would be today. But when you create music - it gets expensive. I remember a full summer of spending almost all of my hard-earned dollars on rent, recording sessions, and the occasional food item. It's been a struggle. I've done my best. I feel successful.There's a next step in my career - and it's finally happening for me.

<li>OST Beta is an full-length, multi-genre album featuring everything from the full symphony, to the high energy rock, and industrial electronic grooves.<br/>
</li> <li>SCD recently had a very successful Kickstarter to fund its second volume's printing, but its counterpart, the OST, was an afterthought. I had no idea how incredible this record was going to turn out. I had planned to do all the mixing in house and not master it, planning only a digital release. But then it grew and expanded. Many studio days were booked, scores of musicians donated their time, and even now, the record is still amassing more epic sounds with additional studio time booked!<br/>
</li> <li>So many people came together to make this record possible. While OST Alpha was a single effort, OST Beta has become the work of a truly talented ensemble of folks.

<li>At a minimum, at least $400-$500 will be needed to get the record mastered at a professional mastering house. I will be using the same mastering house that my band Absinthe Junk has used on its latest release. There is still at least one day's worth of recording to finish up the strings and brass which will be done at Reel Love Recording Company in Nashville. Lastly, CDs will need to be pressed. This record will be a short-run (around $350) but any additional funds will be used to get the record digital distribution and will also go to tipping out the many musicians who have contributed their time to this project. And of course fulfillment.<br/>
</li> <li>Helping this campaign will get you a copy of the original first pressing - originally only available through the Volume 2 Kickstarter. You'll get an exclusive early download of the completed record too. Additional options include getting the record signed, a special Star Cross'd Destiny vinyl sticker to commemorate the occasion, and on the off chance you missed reserving your copy of Volume 2, you can add that in as well!<br/>
</li> <li>If we don't reach the ultimate goal, all funding will still go as far as it can to helping get the OST finished.<br/>
</li> </ul><p></p> <p> </p><h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Dig it?</p> <ul>
<li>This project has been a part of my life for over a decade, and this portion of it, the second OST, has been one of the most incredible experiences. This is some of the best music I have composed in my lifetime to date.<br/>
</li> <li>This will be my second OST to be released for the Star Cross'd Destiny, and my fifth record released overall. <br/>
</li> <li>This is as grassroots as it gets. I'm the composer here. I played a majority of the instrumentation myself - instruments which I taught myself how to play some two decades ago. The musicians I've enlisted to add their majesty are my closest friends and people who inspire me to no end. But there isn't a band here.

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p><strong>Bound</strong></p>
<p>Bound was first conceived by Jerod Show in Tulsa, OK, during the fall of 2007. He set out to form a band which would spark the soul back into metal, much in the same vein of 70's heavy metal innovators such as Deep Purple, Black Sabbath and Motorhead.</p>
<p>By laying a solid foundation under the bridge that combines agression and groove, the rock phenomenon known as BOUND was formed. This band writes and performs original music with gritty vocals, heavy rock riffs, and a rhythm section that provides a tightly structured groove that is essential to their unique sound which brings a fresh, new perspective on metal music.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Producer Elan Morrison</strong></p>
<p><span>Elan Morrison</span><span> is an accomplished American music producer and songwriter. He has created a successful career producing, engineering and writing for artists such as Dr. Dre, Slash, Sean “P Diddy” Combs, Bones, Brandy, Booker T, E3, Boot Camp Clique, Prophet &amp; DJ Skittles, Ray J., Seal, Slayer, Toni Braxton, and Tres as along with corporate clientele including Hummer, Mercedes-Benz and Motorola.</span></p>
<p><span>Elan</span><span> is originally from Baltimore and has since split his time between New York, South Florida and Los Angeles, connecting with some of the greatest musicians and artists of our time along with way. He is a classically trained pianist who brings his unique sound to all of his music - a distinct style that has helped take multiple artists Platinum.</span></p>
<p><strong>The House That Rock Built</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Based in the Denver area, the House that Rock Built serves as a community that helps the youth express themselves through music. We provide programs free of cost where they can learn music through quality training. Music is an avenue for self expression and a gateway for releasing internalized emotions. We believe it has the power to help children and youth remain emotionally healthier and support their overall ability to learn.  We're building a revolution by providing the youth a chance to learn music and supporting our future generations.<strong><br/></strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>The dedicated and hard working musicians that are Bound, have strived and successfully made their mark in the Tulsa music scene. Through their own efforts they have raised a great deal of the funding required to get on the road and promote their sound on a national level.With full time jobs and local gigs practically every weekend, it is rare to find a group with as much talent that is more driven.  </p>
<p>The main focus the last several months has been writing and perfecting new music that will help elevate this band into a well known national and international act. They just need a little assistance to accomplish this final goal and get them on the road to support the new release.</p>
<p>Several music industry professionals have taken notice of Bound, including the international rock webzine Alternative Revolt Magazine, and are eagerly awaiting the new release. Further interest from PR, management, labels and booking agencies are also right in line...along with Producer Elan Morrison's desire and willingness to work at a highly reduced rate to get Bound in the studio!</p>
<p>The members of Bound and Elan all coming from hard working class backgrounds, and fully realize the profound impact music can have on a child. They are all grateful for the opportunities that have been given to them, and know that through hard work those dreams can become reality. Collectively, they want to share some of their good fortune, and help children that may not ever have the chance to hold an instrument in their hands otherwise. </p>
<p>The House That Rock Built's students are emotionally healthier and are less likely to drink and do drugs. As schools around the country are cutting funding to arts programs, especially music, The House that Rock Built will subsidize these budget cuts with the after school facility, and with support and additional funding, and hope to launch their programs on a national level. </p>
<p>They are in urgent need of donations as they re-develop their website and marketing collateral to help spread the word for their organization, the facility, and the resources required to make their programs a success!</p>

<h3>Help Gordon Roque Record his Brand New Album</h3>
<p>My name is Gordon Roque, and I am a Nashville-based singer/songwriter/pianist.  I've spent the last three years writing songs for my brand new full-length album of music.  Back in 2008, I released my first album, ""Seahorses"", and I've drawn on that experience to build what I believe to be a passionate and effusive musical landscape with these new songs.</p>
<h3><strong>Why?</strong></h3>
<p>I am asking for your help because as an independent artist without the funding of a record label, resources needed to record music well are financially out of reach.  </p>
<p>I am a hard-working musician with a desire to make lyrical, whimsical, and dramatic music for all ages to enjoy and be inspired by.  All the music and  albums you buy, films you see, and the books you read are largely made possible through some kind of financial backing.  My new album is no different.  </p>
<h3><strong>What for?</strong></h3>
<p>Funds are needed for equipment and space rental, mixing, mastering, production for a music video, and payment for each of the valuable and talented musicians and sound engineers involved in bringing this music to life.  I have a goal of $3,500 to help meet all of these needs.  </p>
<h3><strong>Gifts For You</strong></h3>
<p>Ultimately, I am asking only for what you can give.  Every single cent will go a long way.</p>
<p>There are numerous donation levels built into this campaign, and each level offers worthwhile gifts for your generosity.</p>
<p>From the seedling level to the rain forest, various packages include advance copies of the new album, physical copies of my first album ""Seahorses"", signed original artwork, a cd copy of b-sides from the recording sessions, original songs written from your ideas, hand-knitted scarves made by me, youtube interpretive or booty-poppin' dancing by yours truly, and house concerts.</p>
<p>By the way, you read that correctly.  For certain packages, I will make a youtube video of myself dancing for two minutes and making a complete spectacle (or fool) of myself for all the world to see.  My family and close friends can attest that I am a crazy dancer.  Donors have the option of choosing either a pitiful and hysterical interpretive dance or a booty-poppin', hip-hop inspired number. (I've been told that I can dance like a fly girl.  Go figure.)  I am doing this for the love of my craft.  May the Lord help us all!!!</p>
<h3><strong>Help Spread the Word</strong></h3>
<p>If you are unable to make a financial contribution, please help me spread the word about this campaign to more people who possibly can give funds.  You can post links and my videos on facebook, twitter, and anywhere else you like as well as tell your friends.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I'll be broadcasting more videos such as those shown so far throughout this campaign showcasing all kinds of things.  </p>
<h3><strong>What This Means</strong></h3>
<p>At the end of the day, I will have an album to present to all of the world.  It will be a collection of music that is a tribute to my Mom and a reflection of my  life over the past few years.  It will be a tender and gentle road map of how I have come to understand what love is and, ultimately, what it means to love myself.</p>
<p>I hope you will join me in this journey.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The songs on this album celebrate life, love, hope, perseverance, and above all, an enduring trust in God. Over the past few months we have been pursuing our dream of releasing a gospel and inspirational album. We have a fun and engaging album on the way, featuring a mélange of sounds from Gospel, Reggae, Zouk, Highlife (Ghana), Hymns and Contemporary Christian. Yes, there’s something for everyone. In the past few years we experienced a mixture of truimph and pain–we each lost a beloved sister. Through these seasons our music sustained us, and we want to share it with others.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This album is as an independent project, so we welcome any support we can get to make it a success.  The funds raised are going towards finishing up the production and promoting the album. Top priorities for disbursing the funds are:</p>
<p>- CD cover design and CD duplication</p>
<p>- Album promotion, especially for launch concert</p>
<p>- Musicians and supporting vocalists for album launch</p>
<p>- Making music video for title song RISE</p>
<p>We are truly grateful for your support. It means a lot, and in appreciation we are offering free downloads and copies of the CD. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your support will bring to reality an uplifting collection of songs that have inspired and invigorated us, and we believe this album will do the same for others.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We welcome your best wishes and enduring support. That's been a big part of what we have accomplished so far.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>What started as humble beginnings for guitarist Chase Robbins and vocalist Jaimeson Robbins, who alongside a single Macbook played venues and house shows in the North Texas area, is steadily developing into one of the best indie rock ‘n roll-blues bands in the region. With the addition of bass player Kristin Leigh, previously of the Dallas-based band Pale Horse, and Steve Phillips on drums, their live show was catapulted to a new level of energy and rhythm. In late 2010, fellow guitarist Carson Coldiron was the fifth and final member added<br/>
to the band's rock 'n roll repertoire, filling out the band's overall sound.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Drawing inspiration from artists like Led Zeppelin and legendary bluesman Howlin' Wolf, The Virgin Wolves' sound is predominantly upbeat rock 'n roll with a twist of fierce, bluesy, matter-of-fact vocals. Their live shows are unparalleled in terms of energy and sex appeal.<br/><br/>
The Virgin Wolves have been featured on “The Local Show”, a weekly presentation of DFW artists on Dallas's Clear Channel station 102.1 The Edge, as well as radio stations ranging from Houston to Maine. In just a short time on the scene, the band has garnered the attention of numerous music blogs, college newspapers and various media outlets. Their first self-titled EP, released in June of 2010, set the stage for the band to play larger shows, as they began drawing in an eager and diverse audience. In March, 2011 they were invited to play at 35<br/>
Conferette, Denton's annual music festival which boasts larger national acts such as Outkast's Big Boi, Reggie Watts, legendary artist Mavis Staples and Dr. Dog. One month later they released Bad Blood, their second and most highly praised album, for which audiences have responded to with excitement.<br/><br/>
As blogger and musician Robbie D. Love from <a href=""http://rockandrollblues.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">rockandrollblues.com</a> puts it, ""We definitely believe The Virgin Wolves will leave their stain on rock 'n roll as innovators of the genre. They know how to get down and dirty, tell a shipwrecked story, break some shit and get out before anybody realizes the walls just burnt down to the ground.""<br/><br/>

<h3>Who is OwlCappella<br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Formed in Fall 2010, OwlCappella is Temple University's first co-ed a cappella group. In only three years of existence we've accomplished great things, including singing at the Philadelphia Car Show, opening for the 85th Annual Radio City Christmas Spectacular at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, and singing in and around Temple and Philadelphia. Our name has already begun spreading all over the world, through collaboration with a cappella groups and fans as far as China. Last year we released Owl or Nothing, our very first studio EP. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why We Need Help</h3>
<p>Since the release of last year's EP, <i>Owl or Nothing</i>, the group has changed dramatically - only 9 of the 17 current members recorded on that CD! So, we're ready to capture this group's unique and electric sound. And, with some of our members having experience in the studio last year, we now know how to be even more creative and efficient with our time, so we're excited to turn everybody's generosity into a unique and ground-breaking CD that everybody will enjoy. To do this though, as a not for profit group, we must rely on fan support to raise the necessary funds.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Your Impact</h3>
<p>Every second in the studio counts, so every dollar is going to directly impact our final product. You'll not only have a direct hand in helping us share our music with thousands of people, but you'll also be helping us grow as musicians as well as create an experience that we will cherish for the rest of our lives. AND, you'll get OWLSOME perks to show for it such as Snapchats, CDs, and T-Shirts! </p>

<p><i>THE SYNOPSIS</i><br/></p>
<p>Our inaugural production is Haydn's <i>Lo Speziale</i>. The story follows the drug dealer Sempronio, his apprentice Mengone, and the woman caught between them, Grilletta. Things become complicated when a sleazy lawyer Volpino threatens Sempronio's business and tries to seduce Grilletta. Volpino and Mengone resort to disguises to trick the distracted Sempronio while Grilletta finds a way to handle her foolish suitors.  </p>

 THE MISSION
The Bay Area Opera Collaborative was founded by singers who believe that opera is an exciting art form that can be enjoyed by a modern audience. Our goal is to reach a wider audience with classical vocal music and
 include first-time opera goers. We believe this can be done through modern staging, the power of social media advertising, and of course great singing! 



THE SYNOPSIS
Our inaugural production is Haydn's Lo Speziale. The story follows the drug dealer Sempronio, his apprentice Mengone, and the woman caught between them, Grilletta. Things become complicated when a sleazy lawyer Volpino threatens Sempronio's business and tries to seduce Grilletta. Volpino and Mengone resort to disguises to trick the distracted Sempronio while Grilletta finds a way to handle her foolish suitors.  
Oh yeah—our version is also a ""Breaking Bad"" parody. You're welcome.

<p>(日本語は下にあります。Japanese below.)<br/>Hi, my name is Tak. Guitarist/Singer from the band Imari Tones.</p>
<p>Our band has a long history. I started this band back in 1999 as my solo recording project. It became an actual band in 2004 and we started playing gigs in Tokyo area.</p>
<p>In 2007/2008, I came to know about Jesus Christ and it was not only a spiritual revelation but also a musical revelation. We started to play “Christian Heavy Metal”. To me it was a form of music in which my passion for music and faith for God came together perfectly.</p>
<p>We played many shows/tours both in and out of Japan, making friends and sharing passion for God. We have come a long way. It was fun. But let me say this: It was not easy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Christianity is very scarce in Japan. It is said only 2.3% of Japan’s population is Christian, according to Wikipedia. We have always been  hoping and wanting to change this situation, trying to convey God’s message to people of Japan.</p>
<p>That’s why we have led The Extreme Tour Japan, a grass roots style Christian music tour, in 2013-2016, touring together with Christian bands from USA, Canada and Chile.</p>
<p>We also launched Calling Records, Japan’s first Christian rock record label, together with some other Christian rock artists such as Clod (Hiroki Miki), Soul of Faith, Yona Ishikawa and Xie.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So many Japanese people think Christianity is Western/European religion. But we don’t necessarily think that way. In fact essence of Christianity was carried to Japan in many ways. For example, if you read the book “Bushido” by Inazo Nitobe, you can see Bushido (Samurai’s code) has so much in common with Christianity. Also it is widely known that Japanese Buddhism in medieval age was influenced by Christianity.</p>
<p>We wanted to incorporate these elements into our music and wondered if it’s possible to make a concept album. A concept album to focus on spiritual nature of Japanese people. At first it seemed almost impossible; This issue was just too big to wrestle with. However, God has given me inspiration in a mysterious way and I wrote all the music literally in 3 days. (31 Dec 2013 to 2 Jan 2014, to be exact) (*Lyrics were written later...)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After 2 years of intense rehearsals and 5 months of recording work, here is the finished album. The concept album about Japanese history.</p>
<p>We titled it “Jesus Wind”, because even though Christianity was never a primary religion in our country, Message of Jesus was always “blowing in the wind” throughout its history.</p>
<p>We, of course, implied “Kamikaze”, God’s Wind that protects Japan. When people say “Kamikaze”, they think of any other God or most likely Shinto Gods, but I want it to be “Jesus”.</p>
<p>After all, it sounds like a heavy metal album, doesn’t it?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Musically, it is very straightforward and intense heavy metal album.</p>
<p>We are basically a band that plays “classic style” heavy metal. However we also take pride in writing some “diverse” type of music. That is why we have been always compared to bands like Rush, along with more typical metal bands such as Stryper and Loudness.</p>
<p>But with this album, we shifted into higher gear and wanted to make a real heavy metal album. Let me just say this is the heaviest, most aggressive, most intense album we have ever made.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So here is some songs on the album.</p>

<p><strong>日本の歴史をクリスチャン視点から物語にしたコンセプトアルバム「Jesus Wind」完成のご報告と、ご挨拶</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Imari Tones (伊万里音色 / イマリトーンズ)は、Tak Nakamineの個人的な録音プロジェクトからスタートし、2004年頃にバンドとして結成し、2008年に神の導きにより「クリスチャンロックバンド」になりました。</p>
<p>その音楽性はハードロック、ヘヴィメタルを基本として、「日本初の本格的クリスチャンヘヴィメタルバンド」を名乗り、活動しています。</p>
<p>ハードロックというジャンルの特性上、その照準は世界に向けられ、日本人にとっての最高のハードロックを目指すとともに、日本人としての最高の「宗教音楽」を作り上げるべく、英語と日本語を交えて作品を作っています。</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2009年から2012年まで、4度にわたりアメリカ遠征を敢行し、現地のライブハウスや教会、音楽フェスティバルなどで演奏を行う中で、The Extreme Tour(1994年からアメリカで行われているクリスチャンミュージックツアー)に出会い、2012年には日本のバンドとして初めてThe Extreme Tourに参加し、西海岸チームの一員として学校、公園、キャンプ場、少年院といったあらゆる場所での演奏を経験しました。</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2013年にはそのThe Extreme Tourを日本に持込み、2016年まで4年連続でThe Extreme Tour Japan(XTJ)を開催。アメリカ、カナダ、チリのクリスチャンバンドたちと共に、また日本のクリスチャンアーティストと共に、日本の草の根の会場を回るツアーを行いました。</p>
<p>また、その活動の中で、ソルフェイ(Soul of Faith)、CLOD(三木ヒロキ)、Xie、石川ヨナといった日本のクリスチャンアーティストたちと出会い、日本発の「クリスチャンロック専門レーベル」であるCalling Recordsを共に立ち上げました。</p>
<p> </p>
<p>そして今回、長年の構想を経て、渾身のコンセプトアルバム「Jesus Wind」をここに作り上げました。</p>
<p>これは、私たちが何年も前から、いつか作りたいと思っていた作品で、日本の歴史をテーマにしたコンセプトアルバムになっています。</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ご存知のとおり日本は、キリスト教はあまり普及しておらず、仏教または神道の国であり、また現実にはほとんどの人は無宗教であり、キリスト教の人口はほんの数パーセントであるとか、1%以下である、と言われています。</p>
<p>けれども、歴史をよく見てみれば、日本の歴史の中には、キリスト教の影響がさまざまな形で持ち込まれており、日本の文化の中には、そのキリスト教の要素が独特の形で織り込まれています。</p>
<p>しかしそのすべてが歴史の教科書に書かれているわけではなく、それらは歴史や文化などの各分野を深く掘り下げた人のみが、知ることのできる真実です。</p>
<p> </p>
<p>私たちはそういった、日本の歴史の中に溶け込み、影響を与えてきた「キリスト」の要素を、音楽を通じて表現したいと思いました。そして、その重く、壮大なテーマに向き合うために、ヘヴィメタルという音楽表現はもっとも適していたと思います。</p>
<p> </p>
<p>一見、キリスト教とは縁遠いこの日本に、歴史を通じて常に吹いていた「キリストの風」。その意味を込めて、私たちはこのアルバムを「Jesus Wind」と名付けました。</p>
<p>そこにはもちろん「神風」という非常に日本人的な、そしてヘヴィメタル的な言葉も示唆されています。</p>
<p> </p>
<p>この難しいテーマに取り組み、作曲をする中で、日本という国が世界で果たすべき役割について考えた時、また昨今の世界情勢や、日本の国内情勢にも刺激され、気がついてみれば私たちは、歴史という「過去」だけでなく、「現在」そして「未来」までもテーマに組み入れてしまいました。</p>
<p>結果的にこのアルバムは”Past”(古代)、”Present”(近代、現代)、”Future”(未来)からなる三部構成の作品となり、日本人の心と信仰の在り方に基づいたひとつの「霊的な預言書」と言えるものになったのではないかと思います。</p>
<p> </p>
<p>音楽的には、正統派のヘヴィメタルを貫きました。</p>
<p>私たちは、これまで比較的幅広いスタイルのハードロック、ヘヴィメタル(Rushあたりによく比較されます)を演奏してきましたが、このアルバムでは、よりストレートでヘヴィなスタイルの作風になっています。単刀直入に言えば、やはりヘヴィメタルの永遠の教科書であるJudas Priestあたりの作風を目指しています。</p>
<p> </p>
<p>私たちがこれまで作ってきた中で、もっともヘヴィで、もっとも密度の濃い、正統派のヘヴィメタル作品になりました。しかし、よく聴いていただければ、その中に、和風のテイスト、プログレッシヴな要素、ボサノバ、ヒップホップといった音楽性も織り込まれていることに、気付いていただけると思います。</p>
<p> </p>
<p>今回、ここにクラウドファンディングを立ち上げ、皆様のご支援をお願いすることを決断しました。</p>
<p>その理由は、ひとつには、デジタル配信だけでなく、きちんとしたCDの形にするための予算が欲しいということがあります。</p>
<p>そして、やはり、一人でも多くの方に知っていただき、このアルバムを聴いていただきたい、という思いもあります。</p>
<p> </p>
<p>けれども、いちばんの理由は、私たちがこれまでの活動でお世話になった方々。</p>
<p>クリスチャンの方も、そうでない方も。</p>
<p>今までに関わっていただき、ご恩を受けたすべての方々に、お礼と、ご挨拶をしたかったからです。</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ヘヴィメタルというマイナーなジャンルを選んでいることもあり、華々しい成功にはなかなか辿り着かない私たちですが、</p>
<p>まだまだ元気で活動して、音楽を作り続けています。</p>
<p>そして、何年にもわたる活動の中で、ついに、ひとつの記念碑と言える作品を作り上げました。</p>
<p>そのことを、皆さんにご報告し、お礼を言いたいがために、このクラウドファンディングを立ち上げ、皆さんにご挨拶する機会としたいと思いました。</p>

</h3><p>For the past year and a half we (Eric + Jen: best friends, 
husband + wife, partners in all things)  have been writing and recording 12 new songs in 
the parlor of the <a href=""www.thekirkestate.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">19th century farmhouse</a> in Upstate New York that we call home. <br/></p><p>Thanks to 
the efforts of some very special friends, we have connected with a world class producer, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_Rev"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mercury Rev's</a> 
Anthony Molina. We've signed on to work with him to remix and master our
 album; the first of several steps toward getting this music into your ears and around the world.</p><p></p><h3>What We Need + What You Get</h3><p>In order to make this album a reality we need your support.<br/>We've budgeted funding for a number of things:</p><ul>
<li>Post-production studio costs of remixing and mastering our album.</li>
<li>The cost of making physical copies of the album.</li>
<li>Promotional expenses, including music videos and a press campaign.</li>
</ul>For your contributions you'll receive unique, exclusive perks like:<br/><ul>
<li>Digital downloads </li>
<li>Our new EP available exclusively to backers of the campaign</li>
<li>B sides and demos</li>
<li>Posters and T-Shirts<br/>

<li>Your name in the liner notes</li>
<li>Handmade gifts</li>
<li>A house show</li>
<li>A pony! (Just kidding. No ponies. But if you want, we'll write you a song about a pony).</li>
</ul><h3>Perspective</h3><p></p><p>The farmhouse where we live was the home to 4 generations of Jen's family before us. For the past 8 years we've worked toward restoring the house and grounds to their former glory. We reintroduced gardens, we've added to the orchards, expanded the arboretum, pulled out shag carpeting, rebuilt dilapidated porches. All while making music in the parlor. </p><p>Since 2006 Jen has worked toward building her business based around our farmstead at <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/help-fund-the-production-of-the-parlor-s-new-album-wahzu-wahzu/www.thekirkestate.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Kirk Estate</a>, while Eric has been working for <a href=""http://www.cdcg.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">an amazing non-profit</a> serving communities in New York's Capital Region. Together we have turned The Parlor into a nationally acclaimed band.  After 15 years of writing songs together, we have decided to give our music the attention we think it deserves. </p><p></p><p>The music video above is for a song off our EP <i>Ghost House</i>, a collection of heartfelt campfire-folk tunes that hearken back to the past. </p><p>For <i>Wahzu Wahzu</i> we stepped away from this musical style and threw ourselves headfirst into enthusiastic dance rock. Though the albums were recorded at the same time, they couldn't be more different.<br/></p><p><i>Wahzu Wahzu</i> blends The Parlor’s style of trance-folk pop with vibrant dance beats and sophisticated melodies. We were listening to Michael Jackson, The Go-Go's, Talking Heads, and Indie-Dance music, dancing in the parlor. </p><p></p><h3>In the Past<br/>

For the past year and a half we (Eric + Jen: best friends, 
husband + wife, partners in all things)  have been writing and recording 12 new songs in 
the parlor of the 19th century farmhouse in Upstate New York that we call home. Thanks to 
the efforts of some very special friends, we have connected with a world class producer, Mercury Rev's 
Anthony Molina. We've signed on to work with him to remix and master our
 album; the first of several steps toward getting this music into your ears and around the world.What We Need + What You GetIn order to make this album a reality we need your support.We've budgeted funding for a number of things:
Post-production studio costs of remixing and mastering our album.
The cost of making physical copies of the album.
Promotional expenses, including music videos and a press campaign.
For your contributions you'll receive unique, exclusive perks like:
Digital downloads 
Our new EP available exclusively to backers of the campaign
B sides and demos
Posters and T-Shirts

Your name in the liner notes
Handmade gifts
A house show
A pony! (Just kidding. No ponies. But if you want, we'll write you a song about a pony).
PerspectiveThe farmhouse where we live was the home to 4 generations of Jen's family before us. For the past 8 years we've worked toward restoring the house and grounds to their former glory. We reintroduced gardens, we've added to the orchards, expanded the arboretum, pulled out shag carpeting, rebuilt dilapidated porches. All while making music in the parlor. Since 2006 Jen has worked toward building her business based around our farmstead at The Kirk Estate, while Eric has been working for an amazing non-profit serving communities in New York's Capital Region. Together we have turned The Parlor into a nationally acclaimed band.  After 15 years of writing songs together, we have decided to give our music the attention we think it deserves. The music video above is for a song off our EP Ghost House, a collection of heartfelt campfire-folk tunes that hearken back to the past. For Wahzu Wahzu we stepped away from this musical style and threw ourselves headfirst into enthusiastic dance rock. Though the albums were recorded at the same time, they couldn't be more different.Wahzu Wahzu blends The Parlor’s style of trance-folk pop with vibrant dance beats and sophisticated melodies. We were listening to Michael Jackson, The Go-Go's, Talking Heads, and Indie-Dance music, dancing in the parlor. In the Past
We independently released our previous album Our Day in the Sun. With limited resources we were able to:Perform at the Farm Aid
 festival alongside music icons like Dave Matthews, Neil Young, Willie Nelson, and John Mellencamp. We opened for Grammy
Nominated artists The Lumineers and shared the bill with acts such as Willy 
Mason, Deer Tick, Phantogram, and Sharon Van Etten. Our music appeared in a Kid President Video, and an award winning Independent Zombie Film, with a music video premiering on Consequence of Sound. We were mentioned in the NY Daily News.
""Our Day in the Sun ranks among the 
best to come out of [the Capital Region] probably ever...the Parlor 
are creating some of the freshest, most creative music you’re likely to 
find around town—or the Internet.” Metroland
The songwriting team of Jen O’Connor and Eric Krans create “a brand 
of music forged by contemporary methods but built from organic, 
acoustic, folk-based textures. It’s the sonic corollary to what the 
couple is bringing to their land, an artisanal reimagining of an antique
 dream,” Metroland. “Together, they are a mesmerizing yin-and-yang musical presence,” NippertownJust think what could be accomplished with your help!The ImpactYour contribution will help us continue the work we've already started.
For months now we've been working out details with Anthony Molina (Mercury Rev) about remixing and mastering. We've booked a studio date and already committed a portion of the funds.

By getting Anthony involved we expect Wahzu Wahzu to be our first radio ready album. Anthony Molina has worked for more than a decade with Dave Fridmann (Flaming Lips, OK Go, MGMT, Tame Impala, Mercury Rev) whose production aesthetic matches our own. 
Anthony has worked with a number of world class record labels including Universal, Yep Roc, RCA, and V2 Records. He has offered his contacts and his reputation to Wahzu Wahzu.  When he first heard our demo of the record he described it as ""a diamond in the rough.""
We plan to work with a PR Company (the Syndicate, another contact of Anthony Molina's) who is eager and interested in helping to promote Wahzu Wahzu  nationally in the music press, on the internet and radio. We hope you'll be reading about The Parlor and Wahzu Wahzu in Rolling Stone or on Pitchfork.
We've filmed four music videos, produced two, and we are working with friends to produce yet more music videos for this record to extend the life of the release into next year and beyond.
With radio ready music, national attention in the music press and Anthony Molina's contacts we will engage in serious discussions with record labels, managers, and agents.
With national attention and industry help we hope to do some strategic touring, possibly as an opener for a band we know and love, with an eye on the festival circuit in Summer 2015.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Jackie.  When I was 15 I met this 14 year old kid with big red hair and glasses at a ska show; his name was Mitchell Dubey.  Mitch changed my life, and brought me into his family and his band.  Because of him, I, as well as many others, am the person I am today.  He was an amazing human being; every one he would meet over the next 9 years of his life would tell you the same, without hesitation.</p>
<p>Tragically, on March 24, 2011, the 23 year old Mitch Dubey was shot and killed in his own home in New Haven, Connecticut, <i>for absolutely no reason.  </i>Mitch was shot because someone shot him.</p>
<p>When I heard the news, my heart stopped. And, after the initial shock had worn off, and I spoke to friends, it seemed like people had the same idea as I did - <i>let's throw an epic show for Mitch and give the money to his family.  </i>A friend and I immediately started reaching out to the bands that we knew Mitch would want to see together, and through friends and connections, we have a line up that is worthy to celebrate such an awesome life.  </p>
<p>Now, the problem is the venue - and for the $5000 operating costs, we can get one.  Because our goal is to donate the money to the family, I don't want to take this money from our ticket sales.  And that's where you come in.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Not only have the Dubey's now lost their only son, but Mitch's father was in an accident that has left him paralyzed from about the neck down.  It is exorbitantly expensive to care for him.  Mitch, although in Connecticut while his family was still living in Los Angeles, would throw shows and send the money raised back home to help out.  If we can raise the $5000 and not use money from the ticket sales, I anticipate us raising between $15,000 and $20,000 for the family.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Simply?  We need $5000 to go to the El Rey Theater in Los Angeles, CA, so that we can do this.  If we don't get it, we'll take money out of the ticket sales - which I don't want to do, but is an option.</p>
<p>What do you get?  Anyone who donates gets the satisfaction of knowing that they're donating money to a great cause.  I don't have much else to offer, and I'm sorry for that.  If I had more, I'd give everyone anything they wanted to make this happen.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>No donation is too small.  However, if you're monetarily challenged like myself, <b>spread the word.</b>  Share this with everyone you know, and maybe it will get into the right hands, and someone who has the money and is generous enough will help us.  Have bake sales, lemonade stands, sell art, sell clothes, whatever you want to do to get money to get Mitch the El Rey.  This isn't just for me, this isn't just for the family, this isn't just for Mitchell; it's for all of us who knew him and loved him and just want to celebrate in a positive way amidst all of the awfulness of this tragedy.</p>

Advertising for the show, food for the guys and maybe a pretty dress for me;) Dan's Pet Shop (Dan Turcotte)  will be doing the recording. I've managed to cover that already under my made up label ""Panda Paw Productions"".Any amount helps because I'm going to keep on truckin' until I get 'er done.

Other Ways You Can Help
Please spread the word to any Sugar Daddy's or Mama's you know who like to support the arts:) And come out to the show! May 18th @ The Reservoir Lounge, show starts 7:00pm.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Divine Soldiers New Mission</h3>

<td>Grace and peace to you, my name is Jason Wallace and I am the founder of Divine Soldiers. If you have never heard about DS before, be sure to check out our history below to see what we are all about.<br/><br/>
            So what is our new mission and what is this opportunity all about? Well, on June 6, 2011, the world lost an amazing life - my beautiful niece Alexandra. I could fill an entire book about all of the great and talented things that Alex could do. I could talk for days about everything that I loved about her, and about how much she meant to me and everyone else that loved her.<br/><br/>
            Alex suffered from depression and unfortunately we lost our fight. That night on June 6, Alex committed suicide. We have hope in knowing she is in a better place, even though the pain of losing her still hurts us so much. At her memorial service, her father stood up and with a sincere heart proclaimed, “The Lord gives and the Lord takes away. But blessed be His name.”</td>

<td>Divine Soldiers was established in 1998, after God enlisted Jason Wallace to the service of music ministry. Not only did God instruct him to minister through music, but he also commanded him to disciple music ministers. <br/><br/>
            Jason wondered if this would be a solo mission or if others would join him. Immediately, he thought of his brother Brandon and asked if he would join him. Brandon agreed and together they began to collaborate on writing their first album, “Ain’t No Othas.” <br/><br/>
            Jason and Brandon prayed about what the name of their group would be. God gave them the name Divine Soldiers. Divine stands for the heavenly inspiration God would give them and the soldier part comes from II Timothy 2:4. In II Timothy 2:4, the apostle Paul writes to Timothy (NIV), “No soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs of everyday life, so that he may please the one who enlisted him as a soldier.”<br/><br/>
            Jason and Brandon have been blessed since the start of their ministry to see hundreds of people come to know Jesus Christ as their personal savoir. They have also been blessed to be joined by the additional members of Divine Soldiers: Anthony and Lia Wallace, AJ Hale, and Aaron Rae. <br/><br/>
            The Divine Soldiers’ mission is to be used by God to change and impact as many lives as they can. They will not compromise the Gospel of Jesus Christ and have only one question. R-U Enlisted?</td>
